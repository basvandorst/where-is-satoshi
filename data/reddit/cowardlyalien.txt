There almost was. 800BTC was almost lost due to a bug in their wallets RNG, but the hacker who got it returned all the BTC.  Similar smaller-scale issues happen quite regularly.

That statement is my personal opinion and is based on the evidence I have seen first hand from the gucciffer leaked files. for example one thing I noticed is that metadata in one of the files contained the username of the last account to access the file. The username was similar to the real name of a high ranking official in russian intelligence. From my own analysis I have seen plenty of evidence that directly links Russian intelligence to the DNC hack, more than enough to convince me beyond reasonable doubt who was behind it, almost everything they did is identical to how Russian intelligence operates and I've seen enough evidence to convince me it wasn't a false flag. Of course you are welcome to do your own analysis too and share your findings.

No, the free file contains actual exploit code. It didn't come from Snowden's leaks (which were mostly just slides and documents). According to some security firms forensics points to it likely coming from some NSA server that was hosting the exploits. 
If I had to guess I would think that the whole auction is a ruse. The leakers have asked bidders to send transactions in a non-standard format that can't be done with a normal bitcoin wallet (they wanted bidders to store their contact details in an OP_RETURN). They also stated that the Bitcoin from losing bids won't be returned and will be kept too. Both of these things obviously deter bidders, nobody has yet to actually include an OP_RETURN in their bid. Also the auction file is actually smaller than the free file, and the free file seems to only contain exploits and implants designed to target firewalls and routers. I suspect the hackers only got exploits related the firewalls/routers and they leaked everything they had and the auction file is fake and empty. I doubt the leakers will even spend the BTC, I think the leakers sole purpose was to leak this info to do damage to the US and the auction is a distraction attempt. Some people (along with me) think this is linked to guciffer 2.0 (DNC hacker) which is almost certainly Russian intelligence.
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:54:35
They didn't "hack the NSA". Just one of their boxes that had the exploits on it. Back when Kaspersky (a Russian security firm might I add) did their analysis on some NSA malware they discovered, they posted the IP addresses of the command-and-control servers that the malware exfiltrates data too. Most of these servers were immediately taken offline, however some were left online for some time. This is likely because these servers were involved in ongoing operations and changing the IP on the implant would risk compromising the op. I had the opportunity to scan these IP addresses and discovered that they were hosted at many different hosting providers and while most ran Ubuntu, some ran CentOS and other linux-based OS's. They likely did this to hide the CNC servers. However this inconsistency is not good and increases the likelyhood of a hack. It's possible that one of the hosting providers was social engineered into giving the attacker access to the server (which is likely registered with fake details, I doubt the server was registered to the NSA), or the hosting provider was hacked and the hacker was able to pivot into the server, or that some software that was used on one specific server was vulnerable, and that these exploits were kept on this server.

Holy shit DON'T DO THAT. Blockchain.info's API is seriously broken and often returns incorrect data. For example, the website hashie.co allegedly had the majority of funds stolen when the blockchain.info API started returning 0 for the network difficulty which was used to calculate the price of cloud miners which resulted in a price of 0 BTC, allowing users to buy them for free. When the API was fixed a few minutes later the users were able to sell them for the real price and automatically withdraw the funds, cleaning out the hotwallet.
Best thing to do is run a full node and have your webapp use your nodes API. You must do that if your webapp makes automated payments or delivers high value goods automatically without human intervention. If your app doesn't do that and you don't want to run a full node then run an Electrum client (or other SPV wallet) and have it connect to electrum servers you trust. Or if you really don't give a shit about security use some other API instead of blockchain.info. Only use blockchain.info's API if you want a 100% guarantee that your service ends up like mtgox.
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:24:09
If you want to run a "Bitcoin-over-Tor node" (IE. Tor hidden service), you only need to run tor as a client and not a relay (you are simply connecting to the tor network rather than relaying traffic for it). Very few hosting providers will have issues with you doing this.
@_date: 2017-02-18 03:39:17
That is the source code for Electrum, see here:
The code you posted does not appear to be modified in anyway.
I can't work my head around the firewall logs. Do you use gufw (called Firewall configuration on Ubuntu)? did you happen to change profiles around that time? gufw runs that --force delete command when you change profiles. That command is not commonly used and is basically only used by gufw, typically the command people would use is something like "ufw allow all" or just stop the ufw service and flush iptables. In any case, I don't understand why the attacker would even try disable the firewall if they already have the ability to execute commands on the machine. There is no need to do that, if you can execute commands, just upload the wallet to some file hosting website, almost nobody blocks port 80/443 or else you'd have no way of visiting websites. Or even just run the send command on electrum and send away all the coins to the attackers address. If they are able to turn off your firewall, they are already in your machine and there is no need to turn it off.
Also you said you found a copy of your wallet in another location, that also doesn't make sense. There is no good reason for the attacker to make a copy of it.
Perhaps all of your efforts to lockdown your OS have made you overly paranoid and what you were looking at was normal activity, most of it likely caused by the changes you made to your OS to secure it.
The most secure way to run a Linux desktop is to only download software from trusted sources, do not install or enable any remote access software if you do not need it (if you do need it then there are lots of security precautions you should take, almost all remote access software sucks ass especially VNC, if you only need a terminal then use SSH with a certificate, configure it to only allow logins from this one account with the cert and if you want setup port knocking for it), ensure you're installing all security updates, use a VPN when using untrusted WiFi networks, install a good adblocker in your browser to prevent malvertising and phishing, don't visit sketchy sites and don't open sketchy email attachments. You shouldn't need to mess around with firewalls etc, you're already behind a NAT any firewall rule you make only affects your local network and you shouldn't be running any software like VNC that will open ports that could put your machine at risk this way. Almost all of the software that runs on a desktop makes outbound connections, it's basically pointless to try and filter those.
The most secure way to store lots of Bitcoin however is to use a hardware wallet from a manufacturer you trust. If you don't want a hardware wallet then you can set up an airgapped PC to store your Bitcoins and other important documents. An airgapped PC is a PC that isn't connected to a network. Get an old PC, open it up and remove the WiFi, Bluetooth and other wireless conectivity from it, install a Linux distro, install electrum and follow the instructions for setting up offline storage. Get a usb drive, preferrably a small capacity one, 1GB is plenty, and use this USB dongle as a dedicated USB stick for transferring files to/from your airgapped PC and main PC, don't plug it into any other computers. You shouldn't transfer any software or other executable files from your main PC to the airgapped one. For additional security get two webcams, you can use them instead of using the USB drive when making a transaction, there is a much lower risk of your airgapped PC getting infected this way.

Your analogy doesn't really work. Some people will switch their node from Core to BU. If they do that, BU will try to load up the blockchain on disk and if theres a segwit block in it, it crashes. BU should assure compatibility with the data stored by Core if they plan on loading it, if they don't want to do that, they need to make their own data folder.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:01:55
Not really. If a portion of the economy disagrees with a change to the currency, they will stop using that currency. It's the economy that puts their faith into the currency that gives it value, and so the economy makes the decisions, not the miners, not the devs. BU thinks you can "force" people to accept it by creating a new currency and attacking the old one, pro tip: only the state can force people to accept a currency.
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:28:24
A hardfork changes the way Bitcoin works and there is no option to opt-out if you don't like the change, and so pretty much everyone needs to agree to it. If a lot of people don't like the change, those people will switch to another currency like BU, and you'll end up splitting the economy in two. You can only do a hardfork when there is widespread consensus to do it, this has been done in the past to fix obvious problems in Bitcoin that everyone agrees are problems. Not everyone agrees that the current situation is a problem, some people think that all scaling should happen on layer 2 tech like lightning rather than on the chain and that Bitcoin is working as it should right now.

I think it is seeing as they had the exact same problems we're having now. Scalability and how to do it has been an issue with every decentralized network. Splitting makes each network smaller and more vulnerable to attack and less useful. Some gnutella networks used "trusted" ultranodes that were used to help it scale and those nodes were taken down by the RIAA. This is a good example why centralization is bad. Networks with too few nodes such as winmx became vulnerable to sybil attacks. Also gnutella networks by in large didn't share files with one another, making each network much less useful, much like BU users won't be able to transact their token with BTC users and vice versa.

Or you could do it without doing a hardfork. Do it as a softfork, such as extension blocks/segwit, where the people that want it can opt-in and use it and the people who don't want it don't have to use it. However you still need the miners on side to do a softfork.

No. It's that BU has only contributed 920KB of code (just less than 1% of the codebase), most of which are documents about the Bitcoin President and also some insults towards blockstream, but lets be nice and call it code too. Out of that code, they have had 2 critical bugs (not including this because it's not really critical, just the 2 that already caused nodes to crash a week ago or so). Core has introduced 27 critical bugs (8 of which appeared in the original version by Satoshi).  Core team have contributed 111200kb of code.
That makes 1 vulnerability per 4,118kb of code of Core. And 1 Vulnerability per 460kb for BU. We're talking 10x as many bugs. And BU hasn't even activated yet, and clearly this issue demonstrates more bugs exist in that 920kb.... Seems like they create bugs everytime they touch something. Even their fix for the last critical bug had 48 suggested fixes by other BU devs and required a new patch to fix potential bugs introduced by the bugfix.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:14:58
This is a bug they created. Does not exist in Core.
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:37:27
Yep. Looks like if you switch from Core to BU, you need to delete the blockchain and resync from scratch.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:15:59
Because doing a hardfork is very dangerous. There have been other suggested methods for increasing the blocksize, such as extension blocks, which is a softfork. The difference between a hardfork and a softfork is that a hardfork requires EVERYONE (not just miners as BU is deluded into thinking) to accept the change, while a softfork is opt-in, the people who opt-in are able to use the extra space. If you do a hardfork and not everyone agrees with it, you could end up splitting Bitcoin in two. Lots of people disagree with doing a hardfork to increase blocksize, mainly because think Bitcoin is working as intended, and so it's not safe to do one right now, but hopefully this will change in time. SegWit is a fix for malleability and other things plus a form of extension blocks that will increase the space for blocks to 1.7-2MB.

Here's one example. There are more if you look through. You can see here they changed the variable name of the 1MB block size limit to BLOCKSTREAM_CORE_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE
This makes it difficult to receive patches from Core as you have to edit the patch and change all instances of the old variable name to the new one.

Schnorr sigs are new way to do multisig transactions that are more private, use less disk space and bandwidth and are quicker to validate. Multisig transactions (a transaction that requires 2-of-3 keys to spend the coins) are getting much more popular, implementing something like this will give a capacity boost, plus it's an overall better way to do multisig. With old multisig you can see what they keys are (so if its a 2-of-3, 3-of-5 etc) this new way only has one key that appears on the blockchain, so you can't know anything about the setup by looking at the blockchain.
It doesn't require SegWit. In fact, very few things actually require SegWit. Lightning doesn't require SegWit, it's just that all of the current versions of Lightning use SegWit as SegWit fixes lots of bugs that could affect Lightning, we could "code around" those bugs and make a version of Lightning that doesn't require SegWit. That will probably happen if SegWit never activates. However it would be a "buggier" version of Lightning and we'd risk making the bitcoin codebase as buggy as Bitcoin Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:13:03
SegWit fixes transaction malleability, which is the excuse that Mark Karpeles once gave for some of the problems at MtGox. 
Transaction malleability became a problem for them because they used their own modified buggy version of Bitcoin Core....
Though we don't know for sure if tx malleability actually caused MtGox losses. However, they did have issues with some withdrawals not confirming, also caused by a buggy Bitcoin Core. They used to have a page showing stuck withdrawal tx's because they couldn't figure out why they weren't working.

One problem is that Bitcoin contains a library from Nokia called QT, and while it is open source, it is multi-licensed and has a strange non-standard licensing agreement called the Qt commercial license. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Bitcoin Core were asked by Nokia to pay a small amount of money to continue using that library, you need to pay to use it as GPL. Releasing the Nokia library closed source, like the BU devs did, is very likely against the licensing agreement (illegal) from what I've read, even if only for a short amount of time.

I think they get so much hate because almost every Bitcoin service that was established before 2012 that held customers funds was hacked and all funds stolen (except for ole' BTC-e which somehow recovered after every hack). It's a dangerous business model. Many people will say that coinbase has insurance so this is not an issue, however BitPay is insured with the same insurer and was hacked for a few million, and [the insurer didn't pay out due to a technicality.]( Coinbase also have some [questionable privacy/security practices]( I don't know if this is the case, but last time I checked, Coinbases's 2FA provider, authy, allowed you to receive 2fa tokens via SMS and there was no option to disable this. This is very dangerous, anyone with access to ss7 can read these text messages. ss7 access can be purchased from many companies, [many large cybercrime groups have access to it]( Many telco companies have also been manipulated by hackers into sending out replacement SIM cards to hackers, which they could then use to receive SMS 2fa codes. Also [coinbase freezes accounts that they suspect are involved in online gambling]( even if that activity is legal in the customers jurisdiction, and also accounts involved in drugs. This is done based on blockchain evidence, which is certainly not conclusive. Lots of people use a websites deposit address to receive Bitcoins. If a coinbase user sent to one of these addresses, and it happened to belong to a gambling website, their account could be closed. Blockchain evidence can also be completely wrong. Some Bitcoin mixers produce false links between addresses. This can happen if a user of a gambling website uses a coinjoin-type mixer and a user of another legitimate business uses the same mixer, both websites wallets may appear to be linked via blockchain evidence and a coinbase user that uses the legitimate website may have their account closed. Account closures cannot be appealed. Coinbase also does not provide any kind of proof-of-solvency, so we have no idea whether they are operating a fractional reserve or not.

It's not majorities, this isn't a "vote". There is no voting on a hardfork, everyone must accept the hardfork or the currency is going to split. Absolutely nobody wants Bitcoin to split. Splitting has been the major killer of all decentralized p2p networks of the past, such as gnutella. Some Core devs worked on gnutella implementations, they have seen this happen. If people oppose it, clearly it's too risky to do. Better to do it in an opt-in way, where if you want the change you can use it, but no one is forced to use it. This is what segwit does.

Yeah it used to be as easy as downloading Bitcoin-qt, and syncing the couple of gigs of the blockchain.

Increasing this even more will only exacerbate the problem, until the nodes become highly centralized and vulnerable to attack.

bignum squaring is a mathematical function used all over the code, pretty much everywhere. And x86_64 is the 64bit computers we all use if you didn't know. Some changes made to openssl in the future could have had pretty serious issues if that wasn't found. It wasn't an 'exploitable' bug, so not so serious right now, but still scary to find something like that.
EDIT: more info here:


- The probability of BN_sqr producing an incorrect result at random is very low: 1/2^64 on the single affected 32-bit platform (MIPS) and 1/2^128 on affected 64-bit platforms.
- On most platforms, RSA follows a different code path and RSA operations are not affected at all. For the remaining platforms (e.g. OpenSSL built without assembly support), pre-existing countermeasures thwart bug attacks [1].
- Static ECDH is theoretically affected: it is possible to construct elliptic curve points that would falsely appear to be on the given curve. However, there is no known computationally feasible way to construct such points with low order, and so the security of static ECDH private keys is believed to be unaffected.
- Other routines known to be theoretically affected are modular exponentiation, primality testing, DSA, RSA blinding, JPAKE and SRP. No exploits are known and straightforward bug attacks fail - either the attacker cannot control when the bug triggers, or no private key material is involved.

Yeah Bitcoin has been one of the longest running large decentralized networks without too many issues. No matter what happens it was a huge success. I do think that this blocksize issue is going to create more issues for Bitcoin, which could eventually lead to it's death. I'm still hopeful for the future of cryptocurrencies, in particular the MimbleWimble design which the entire blockchain never grows bigger than 1MB. MimbleWimble could be added to Bitcoin as a sidechain, though that would require segwit....

Because the spam attacks are back again. If someone were to spend the $50-$100k/mo spamming Bcash like they are spamming Bitcoin, they would also have really high fees, but nobody cares about bcash to spend $50k spamming it.
I wonder who has a financial incentive to spend $50k a month spamming Bitcoin.
Storage space isn't a problem. The problem is quite simple. If you want to see it, simply download Bitcoin Core and run a node and watch how slow your internet goes. This is why the node count has gone from 50,000 to 5,000, and if it keeps going lower then we'll end up with a centralized coin and Bitcoin will have been for nothing.
Segwit which will significantly help with the spamming problem will be live in just a few days, so don't panic yet. You can blame the miners for stalling this optional upgrade for many years.
I also wonder why they would do that, I mean it's an optional upgrade, nobody is forced to use segwit, you can continue using Bitcoin without segwit after it goes live so there is no good reason to stall it. Funny how they are making a killing off of the fees right now too, no way would the miners purposely stall something like that so they can make a killing.

If transaction fees are cheaper, whats stopping a spammer from filling up 8MB blocks with spammy transactions?
Sure, they will have to make more transactions, but each transaction will have a lower fee. if the tx fee is at least 8x lower then it is cheaper to spam attack bcash than Bitcoin.
Bcash users would then have to outbid the spammer, which will cause rising tx fees and txes to get stuck and would make 0 confirmation txes unsafe, once again.

Bcash will need to hard fork to remove EDA. Miners will be reluctant to do that because it will hurt their income significantly.

Not really because you still have the responsibility of keeping your coinbase account safe. If your coinbase password is stolen and you don't have 2fa, your coins are stolen from coinbase. If you get phished, even if you have 2fa your coins are stolen from coinbase. If you get infected with a virus, even if you have 2fa your coins are stolen from coinbase. Coinbase will not reimburse you if your account gets hacked, thats your responsibility.
When it comes to theft, storing coins on coinbase has the same risks as storing them in a wallet you control, plus the risk of coinbase getting hacked. Funds stored at coinbase are at a higher risk of theft.

Antpool isn't confirming a lot of peoples transactions, causing transactions to take a long time to go through and costing people more in transaction fees.
Normally miners will confirm as many transactions as they can, because when they confirm one they earn the transaction fees from that transaction. Antpool has given up $100,000+ in transaction fees in the last 24 hours alone by not confirming as many transactions as they can.
Why would they do this? many suspect it is the use of covert ASICBOOST, which is a mining shortcut that was confirmed to be implemented in hardware on Bitmain's (AntPool's) ASIC chips and gives them a huge advantage. When confronted, Bitmain claimed not to use this functionality because it is bad for Bitcoin (their words). Because it is covert it is difficult to tell if it's happening or not, but some side-effects of it include empty blocks or blocks with very few transactions, like what we are seeing now.

The issue is the super complicated way segwit2x activates segwit. What has happened so far is segwit2x has been locked in, and segwit2x begins the process of forcing the activation segwit, which will then lock in and a bit later actually go live.
They did it this way so that nodes using the old way of activating segwit wouldn't need to upgrade.
The reason they didn't just activate the old way is because 1) it had a 95% activation threshold, which was too high 2) so that the segwit2x folk can claim credit for activating segwit, and gain influence so that they can later push for the 2x part (increasing the blocksize).

Coinbase moves your Bitcoins around and doesn't store them in the same address. This is because Coinbase is the one holding your bitcoins for you and they are the ones who own the Bitcoin address you deposited to.

There is a very good technical reason for doing that.
Bitcoin Core won't be following the 2x fork and once the 2x activates, 2x nodes will be relaying invalid blocks to Core nodes. Any node that gives another data they don't understand will accumulate a banscore and eventually get IP banned by that node, this is how Bitcoin works and always has worked, it is how pretty much all decentralized networks work. This will actually make it hard for people to switch their node from 2x to Core (and vice versa if 2x doesn't implement this) as anyone who runs a 2x node would be IP banned from many nodes on the Core network for a small period of time once the fork happens. Instead of IP banning them, Core will simply disconnect them, so that if that person chooses to switch over to Core once they realized they have forked off the network, they can do so without being banned for a while. It will also reduce potential disruption on both chains during the fork by disconnecting before the node gives bad data because it knows it's going to once it activates.

No because segwit is an entirely opt-in thing. Use of segwit is entirely optional. Nothing about Bitcoin has actually changed due to segwit, the underlying system is exactly the same. This is why the FUD around segwit pissed me off so much, if you don't like it don't use it.
ASICBOOST isn't possible on blocks that contain segwit transactions, however, miners do not have to include segwit transactions.
The activation of segwit does 2 things: it makes it much more obvious who is using ASICBOOST as those miners will never mine segwit transactions.
Segwit also allows for a lot more transactions, when use of it grows it is possible that the extra revenue miners make by using ASICBOOST will be less than the fee revenue they would get by mining segwit transactions so they would have to turn off ASICBOOST to make maximum profit.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:24:50
Give it a while. When lots of people are making segwit txes miners will have to include their transactions if they wish to maximize profits, which they should always strive to do in the mining industry which is a highly competitive market.
Likely miners will have to update their software and they don't have any reason to do that yet if there isn't many segwit txes.

That is likely because of a bug in EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment) in Bcash.
What is happening is Bcash miners are mining blocks until the difficulty goes up, making it harder to mine, they then stop mining Bcash and wait for the EDA to kick in and adjust down the difficulty. Then they start mining again.
This is bad for a number of reasons:
1. You end up with long periods of time with no blocks, as you seen
2. You then end up with short period of time with really fast blocks, for example 1 block every minute instead of every 10 minutes, which is what is happening on Bcash.
3. The mining reward schedule becomes sped up by all of these fast mined blocks. Mining rewards halve every 4 years, Bcash is predicted to half in 2020, however because of this bug in EDA, the halvening could happen as soon as a couple weeks time. The inflation rate of Bcash is much much higher than what was described in Satoshi's whitepaper.
Just to note that EDA is the only big feature that Bcash developers added to their coin and it is completely broken. Almost everything else was copied from Bitcoin, and the transaction replay attack fix was taken from segwit of all things.

I don't see how you would lose anonymity using a properly done multisig escrow. The escrow does not need to do anything or even know anything about the transaction unless there is a dispute, so they may charge a very small fee per transaction (likely much less than the ~3% merchants are charged for cc transactions), or a fee per dispute.
Additionally credit card companies charge the merchant a [$30-$100 fixed fee]( per every disputed payment (yes even for a $1 payment - the merchant would lose $29, and multiple fees if there were multiple payments for the same thing), so a multisig escrow would be considerably cheaper.

It's kind of a catch 22. The people selling coconuts accept fiat and not Bitcoin because buyers have fiat, not Bitcoin. If buyers had Bitcoin, then the seller would have an incentive to accept it directly as he would get his money within minutes rather than waiting a month for the cheque (which will have less purchasing power by then due to hyperinflation), avoid paying a ~3% fee to the card processor and have more control over his money rather than having it managed by a bank that is regulated by an unstable government who could place restrictions on his money at any time or even outright seize it without fair judicial oversight. Transacting in other currency may be illegal, but I don't see how such a government is going to enforce the law on people buying and selling coconuts on the beach, other than having Bitcoin police patrolling the beaches and demanding Bitcoin wallets be decrypted at gun point.

Well for one you should post a scam accusation online with all details so that future prospective buyers will know to be weary. You should also report the theft to the police, if it was a lot of money you could try to identify the thief and sue them. Once you report the theft to the police and have a case number you may be able to write the loss off on your taxes. Thirdly consider using an escrow in future whenever possible. An escrow is a person who is designated to resolve disputes between the buyer and seller. It can be done is a way that doesn't require much trust using a feature called multisig. This is very common when trading on forums like bitcointalk. You must be very careful when transacting with Bitcoin especially without an escrow. Do your research.

When you receive a Bitcoin payment, your wallet checks to see if any of the rules of Bitcoin are being broken. SPV wallets cannot check all of the rules, they can only check some of them, as you need to download the entire blockchain to do some of the checks, so SPV wallets simply trust that the miners have done those checks for them. The miners are able to cheat SPV wallets. A full node is capable of checking all the rules, and is thus the safest type of wallet to use when receiving money.

I don't know the fastest the libsec256k1 library can go, I'm sure it is better optimized than openssl, but openssl currently only goes to 100MB/s, so if Bitcoin were still using that today as it did for many years, then the fastest hardware in the world would still take 6.3 minutes, and in any case, a 3MB attack block will take a LOT longer.
There are also some mailing list posts from 2013 by Peter Todd and Sergio Lerner that go into much more detail on this issue.


The alternative to running a node is an SPV wallet. If you don't know, SPV wallets connect to a Bitcoin node and use it as their trusted source of information from the network. SPV wallets can't fully validate blocks, so they have to trust the miners too, as well as the node. The miners can do a hundred malicious things to SPV wallets. The node you connect to knows all of your Bitcoin addresses. The node can fake unconfirmed transactions, so if you accept an unconfirmed tx the node operator could scam you. The node can also refuse to relay your tx, and if it does that you'll need to switch to another node, giving that node all your Bitcoin addresses too.
An SPV wallet is OK if you have a small amount of BTC. But if you have a large amount of BTC, you'll probably want to run a node as it will give you much more privacy, security and anti-censorship. Run one node and use it as your trusted source for all your SPV wallets.


According to that website, they think only miners should run nodes. That is not the Bitcoin I signed up to. The Bitcoin I signed up to was one that would weaken the power grip governments have over the financial system. It was a currency that could be used by a political dissident to move their life savings out of a hostile state. You can't safely use Bitcoin for that purpose with an SPV wallet.
Miners only running nodes doesn't make sense. The point of mining is to order transactions in order to prevent double spending, by using PoW as a timestamp that can be validated by anyone. If nobody else is properly validating it, it is pointless to waste electricity mining. Just have the miners sign the order of transactions with a key.

There are PoW algorithms that, based on humanities current level of technology, the best hardware that they run on is cheap commodity RAM found in every PC and it will stay that way unless there is some weakness in the algorithm (possible since they are new), or there is a breakthrough in technology (which could happen to sha256 too, such as quantum computers). Also, cuckoo cycle is based on sha256, so even if cuckoo cycle has a weakness that completely breaks it, it falls back to sha256 strength, and ASIC's can be developed that run it (though that may take 1-2 years), so in the case of a serious weakness, we'd eventually end up back where we are now. One problem with current Bitcoin ASIC's is that a few companies own patents to certain optimization techniques and do not let other manufacturers use those optimizations, this of course leads to centralization. ASIC's are not a free market.
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:53:24
It's disengenuous to call it an efficiency gain.
An ASIC moving from 56nm to 28nm is an efficiency gain, because it does more work (more operations) for less electricity.
ASICBoost doesn't do more operations for less electricity. ASICBoost lets the ASIC skip doing some of the work. It is a shortcut that allows it to skip some operations when computing a hash. If everyone used it, it wouldn't make a difference, it would still require the same number of operations to attack the network prior to it existing. While there would be an increase in network difficulty, it would have the same level of security as pre-ASICBoost difficulty.
The security of the network is the number of operations it takes to attack it.
This is why ASICBoost is a shortcut, not an efficiency gain, it does not contribute any additional security.
In short:
Lets say the ASIC can do 100,000 operations/sec
Computing a hash takes 100 operations.
ASICBoost lets you skip 30 operations, allowing you to do it in 70.
It does not increase the operations/sec of the ASIC, so does not increase the security. It is essentially "fake hashpower".

Thats miner signalling. Miner signalling was never done by Satoshi in any of his forks, they were all user activated. The 1MB block size limit was added by Satoshi via UASF. The idea of letting miners decide forks was only discussed for the first time in 2012. Every one of the miner activated forks had issues with miners stalling them, even though the Bitcoin economy wanted the forks. The economy should decide, as they are the ones who put their faith in the currency which gives it value. If the currency is changed in a way that a large amount of the economy don't like, they will stop accepting the currency, and the coins the miners are mining will be worthless, so they will have to mine on the new chain if they want to earn anything. If you look at  you'll see that a large portion of the economy supports segwit, so doing a user activated fork is the best way forward.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:59:35
A 51% attack could cause a huge drop in the price. People would be unable to move their coins. Coins would be stuck at exchanges, the only way to move them would be to sell and withdraw. It would also cause huge panic and many people would lose faith in the currency and sell. The attacker could do a leveraged short beforehand, and earn significantly more than what he'd get by mining. Also it's unlilely the attacker could mine for an entire day unnoticed, so realistically speaking he'd only gain ~200btc before being noticed, while a 10x leveraged short sell of $100,000 and a 30% price crash would  earn $300,000.

I heard about this kind of thing happening months ago, you may recall I replied to one of your posts about this a few days ago:
The rumour I heard from an employee of a foundry is that there are ASIC's being made that contain all kinds of secret patented optimizations, including ASICBoost which is the main one that gives the biggest performance increase, and that these are sold under exclusive contracts to large mining farms and are not available to the general public. This creates monopolies. There are only a handful of foundries in the world, they must abide by patent law, this gives the manufacturers who own these patents a monopoly to use this tech, which is not good for mining as a whole, it's no longer a free market.
The second issue is the 'secret' version of ASICBoosting prevents many kinds of network upgrades from working, including segwit. This gives miners incentives to oppose these changes.
Nullc's proposal does not ban any optimization technique. It only prevents the secret method from working. The overt method, which doesn't break network upgrades or do strange things will still continue to work.
Personally I think these optimizations should be made impossible to do, it's disengenous to call them efficiencies, more like shortcuts, as these kinds of optimizations do not contribute to the security of the network. They can be made impossible to do, so attackers cannot use them either.

u/nullc made a post here:


Basically the proposal for Bitcoin forces the activation of segwit in all the existing non-UASF nodes. I know why it does this-- they are the vast majority right now and the people pushing the proposal want it done fast. That is a reasonable position, but the forced activation guarantees some amount of disruption that would otherwise not happen. It's subjective if faster activation and a slightly simpler proposal would be worth what a strong likelihood of at least a small amount of disruption.
There was some litecoin patch I saw going around that defines a new segwit flag, so those nodes can activate segwit with no disruption, and I think that is ultimately a somewhat better path.
I'd support either approach if it has sufficiently strong support, however.

Segwit doesn't fix quadratic hashing for old Bitcoin addresses, making it unsafe to increase the base blocksize, the only safe way it can be increased in the future is with extension blocks.
The issue is that it's possible to craft a 1MB transaction that takes longer to validate than 10x 0.1MB txes, 30 seconds in fact. A 2MB transaction takes 10 minutes to validate with current hardware. This means that if we upped the base blocksize to 2MB and a miner spammed blocks containing a 2MB tx, then nodes would never be able to catch up, it would essentially be a network-wide DDoS and even worse it would cause loads of chainsplits and double spends.
The way segwit fixes this is that a 1MB segwit transaction takes the same amount of time to validate as 10x 0.1MB segwit txes.
So if we wanted to increase the base blocksize, all nodes, merchants, Bitcoin ATM's and miners would have to update and everyone, every single user, would have to switch to segwit addresses. This is really messy. The only safe way to increase the blocksizelimit is to use an extension block softfork. Extension blocks are very new and have trade-offs, so it's probably better to wait a while for the idea to mature (and the code be written) before we try increase the blocksize again.

It's not the first time something like this happened. It was hacked twice by two different white hat hackers last year, fortunately they were good people and didn't steal any data and helped lastpass patch it:
LastPass wasn't so lucky in 2015. They were hacked and had some data stolen:
Over the years they've had numerous security hickups. In general, I think it's a bad idea to trust these cloud password managers. Best bet is to use something that runs locally on your machine and back it up yourself. The popular one is keepass, but I don't like it myself as it's really clunky, slow and ugly. It also doesn't sync between devices by default and requires all sorts of work-arounds to do that. There are a lot of password managers out there, but it seems to me all the big ones suck, and the small ones have yet to prove themselves, so I don't think there is any perfect choice right now, but personally I do not trust lastpass at all and am wary of all cloud-based password managers.

Bitcoin is a currency that was designed to not have a central point-of-failure, in part, to make it resistant to attacks from governments. Patent law allows manufacturers to prevent competition by using the state, giving them a monopoly. This seems very counterintuitive to everything that makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin. Under anarchocapitalism you are allowed to profit from your own creations, but you may not use the state to prevent competition.

ASIC's are not a free market. Asic manufacturers own patents on several different optimization techniques and refuse to allow other manufacturers to use them. Some of these ASIC manufaturers have exclusive contracts with large mining farms (or run the farms themselves) and refuse to sell (or sell them at exorbitant prices) their proprietary, superior ASIC's, to mere mortals.
There are PoW algorithms that, based on humanities current level of technology, the best hardware that they run on is cheap commodity RAM found in every PC and it will stay that way unless there is some weakness in the algorithm (very possible since they are new), or there is a breakthrough in technology (which could happen to sha256 too, such as quantum computers). The memory-bound hash function cuckoo cycle is based on sha256, so even if cuckoo cycle has a weakness that completely breaks it, it falls back to sha256 strength, and ASIC's can be developed that run it (though that may take 1-2 years), so in the case of a serious weakness, we'd eventually end up back where we are now and not any worse off.
Long term I'd love to see a PoW change, cuckoo cycle looks good, it would be even better if we could do some proof of activity type system (is there even a safe way to do this?) so we could create a financial incentive for running a node too.
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:11:48
The fee is based on the current market price and fluctuates depending on how congested the network is. The amount of BTC does not matter, it's the size of the transaction in bytes that matters. The transaction will be around 250bytes You can check on  to see the breakdown on current fees. Right now it will probably be around 150 satoshi/byte. So approximately 37,500 satoshi or 0.00037500 BTC. Does coinbase tell you what the fee will be before you send?

Thats the best option for getting segwit activated, but PoW change is the best way to deal with mining centralization, but is very dangerous. I don't see segwit hitting it's current 95% activation threshold, no way is Jihan going to signal for it for example. I think once/if LTC activates segwit, more Bitcoin miners will signal segwit, and it would be reasonably safe to UASF. Long term I'd love to see a PoW change, cuckoo cycle looks good, it would be even better if we could do some proof of activity type system and introduce a financial incentive for running a node too.

There is two reasons for the empty blocks. Because of the current 1MB blocksize, it can take around a minute to validate the last block and the miner can't validate any new txes until they validate the last block.
This would mean miners would have to stop mining for 1 minute while they validate the block.
What they do instead is "SPV mining" where they just mine an empty block on top of the last one for the 1 minute while it is being validated, and once it's validated they continue on and construct a full block.
This is bad because in 2015, this caused a fork when a miner mined on top of an invalid block.
Raising the blocksize will increase the validation time. This is a good argument against increasing the blocksize.
~~With that said, mining empty blocks is also a side-effect of ASIC boosting. Partially filled blocks (with around 12 txes), and blocks that contain atleast 12 txes in a random order are also signs.~~
EDIT: covert ASICBoosting does not need to reorder transactions. They can keep making different txes to themselves until they find good candidate blocks. This is fully undetectable.
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:44:34
Yes EC is BU.
BU's plan is to get miners to support their chain by giving miners the power to make economic policy (the power to decide blocksize) and also by paying them (bitcoin.com pool pays out 110%, an extra 10% bonus out of Roger Ver's pocket for supporting BU, he even wants to up this to 200%). Once they have enough hashpower, their plan is to do a 51% attack on the Core chain, essentially making it impossible to do transactions on it, and force people over to BU. They think they can force people to accept a currency. Pro tip: only the government can force people to accept a currency. If they do a 51% attack, then the miners will be 'fired' by changing the PoW algorithm because they are not doing their job, which is to order transactions. 
BU spread propaganda that "only hash matters" because thats the only support they have. They have less nodes and only a fraction of the economy on their side. They point to the "one-cpu-per-vote" part of the whitepaper to back this up, but that refers to miners "voting" on the order of transactions. Miners never voted on anything other than the order of transactions until 2012.

Right, some wallets use bloom filters, but these are so ineffective (as you pointed out) that it is almost the same as sending the addresses. Some wallets such as Electrum literally just send the addresses. In both cases it is trivial for the node operator to figure out your addresses with a high level of certainty.

Do you run a node? why not? surely the 300GB bandwidth and 2GB RAM to run a non-listening node is nothing to you at all and an initial sync that can take weeks is perfectly fine. Doubling the block size increases bandwidth by more than double. Clearly 600GB+ bandwidth is nothing for 2MB blocks. Or maybe you don't run a node an use an SPV wallet instead. SPV wallets send all their Bitcoin addresses to the node, trust the node to relay their transactions, trust the node to not lie about unconfirmed txs, and trust the miners not to do any of the hundred malicious things they could do to SPV wallets. Who cares about privacy, security or anti-censorship? clearly there is no need for anyone to run a node! So theres no issue making it harder and harder to run a node until they become highly centralized, making it possible for them to be forced to spy on people, censor people, or even get completely shut down.

To make an ASIC chip, you need a billion dollar facility. Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers design chips, get foundries to make them and put them on a PCB. There are only a handful of foundries in the world.
There are patents on ASICBoost in most countries that have foundries. No foundry will risk a lawsuit to make the chip for anyone that the patent holder doesn't give permission to. This gives patent holders exclusive rights to the tech, which  leads to the creation of monopolies.

Chinese government can turn off all antminers in China using the great firewall. Domain is hosted at cloudflare, US government can coerce them as they have done before and turn off all antminers worldwide.
If they wanted to make an anti-theft system, one safe way to do is there should be a password stored on the miner that is set by the owner, and when the miners are stolen the owner gives this password to bitmain and the activation server sends the password to the miner to disable it. This way nobody but the owner can remotely turn off the ASIC.

We don't know for sure. It's a secret. It's real, there is a whitepaper that explains it on the site, the Core devs even proposed a fork to prevent it from working. I think we're lucky butterfly labs were so incompetent. If they were smart they could have patented many parts of their ASIC design to make it really difficult/impossible for anyone else to legally make an ASIC. I think we should tackle the route of the issue and fork to a PoW algo that makes this thing much less likely rather than hardforking everytime a secret patent is discovered, like the devs proposed.

The job of miners is to order transactions. Finding exploits are done by people with backgrounds in security. Bitcoin is open source, anyone can look for exploits.

Thats what they say on the website, however Peter Rizun, lead BU dev, has stated that in the event a minority chain has hashrate, they will have to orphan blocks on the old chain, "to prevent risk of a split" and "to let miners know they're on the wrong chain". This is now known as the Rizun-Andressen attack, it is essentially a 51% attack. Jihan Wu, owner of a large BU supporting mining farm, also promised to spend $100 million attacking the minority chain "no matter the PoW function they use". Also they refuse to implement replay protections, they stated the main reason for doing this was to attack the old chain.

Because there is a lot of signatures to be checked. This is the quadratic hashing problem, if you want to read more. A minute was a bit of an exageration, maybe 30 secs.
ASICBoost is fairly advanced tech and while there is a whitepaper, it doesn't describe everything and I haven't spent very long studying it and it doesn't describe the covert method at all which is what were discussing, so I may be very wrong about parts of this, but from the basic gist of what I understand and heard from others, ASICBoost works by finding block headers with partially colliding hashes.
There are a few ways of doing this, one way is they try mess around with an empty block.
If they don't find a collided header, another way is they reorder transactions. Transactions are usually ordered in the block by fee, with the ones who have the highest fee at the top. So ASICBoost tries to reorder the transactions to find a block header with a partially collided hash. It needs to reorder atleast 12 transactions to do this.
Miners don't have to have transactions ordered by fee, but there is little reason to reorder them unless your are ASICBoosting. So this doesn't prove anything conclusively, but it is interesting evidence.
The overt way, the obvious way, is they keep changing the block version number until they find a collided block header.
**EDIT: covert ASICBoosting does not need to reorder transactions. They can keep making different txes to themselves until they find good candidate blocks, this is fully undetectable**

Well if I like to troll it would make sense that I'd have access to an alleged "organized PR trolling campaign" chatroom. This channel has no connection to blockstream or Core at all, other than 1 Core dev pops in. The channel is dead most of the time. I had assumed this channel was public and calling it an "organized PR trolling campaign" is absolutely ridiculous, much like many of the accusations thrown around by BU supporters.
I think it's very unfair for BU supporters to attack and slander the blockstream brand in the way they are. The company is run by some Core devs, who have decision making powers so there is nobody "controlling them" especially not the Bilderberg group as some have alluded to, and the company is kind enough to allocate much needed funding to Core development. I do not believe the company has any financial incentive to see LN deployed, seeing as they did not write any of the LN implementations and as far as I know, do not have plans to run a LN hub (it's likely coinbase and bitpay will be the major hubs as they already have lots of merchants signed up to them). I think that blockstream has a good case to sue the people pushing slanderous claims about their business, but that is not likely to happen as it would probably damage their reputation.
LN is also planned to be implemented in alternative implementations. This is one thing that really bugs me, it seems like both groups mostly want the same things. It's just that BU thinks it's OK to sacrifice decentralization for a temporary growth in capacity. The main reason stated by Core devs that oppose increasing the blocksize limit is that the vast majority of people aren't running nodes and increasing it will make this more difficult. In the future when the resources required to run a node are decreased by the various things are currently being worked on, then this argument holds no weight and there will be no good reason to oppose increasing the limit and it will be possible to increase the limit with extension blocks, something that is part of segwit.

One issue is that if they need to make a small transfer out of the cold storage they have to get keys that could be used to spend the whole thing, potentially putting it all at risk when they only need a small amount. They have to pray to Jesus that all of the devices used to sign aren't compromised as if they are it's all gone.
If it was split up into smaller amounts it would be a bit safer. Though it appears they rarely transfer funds out of this address, it seems to be very long term and rarely used so this isn't a very big risk.

Bitmain has one in China:
It appears to be a granted patent, not an application.


A manufacturer having such a patent gives them a monopoly to produce products using the tech. There is no obligation on the manufacturer to license to tech to anyone else or sell the miners. The manufacturer may decide to hold onto the tech and mine for themselves if that is the most profitable solution.


You need a foundry that can produce the chips. Not every country has many foundries, especially ones than can produce 16nm tech. The existence of a patent in another country may make the foundry weary of doing business with you. Foundries outside of China are very selective of their clients. BFL had significant issues getting a foundry to produce their chips.


Thats true for any exploit in Bitcoin.

Based on their TOS and policies that I skimmed through I think that a VPN service that didn't allow their users to violate copyright law would be OK, but of course actually stopping users from doing that would be near impossible.
Basically as long as the VPN services has some disclaimer that says "do not use our services for piracy" it should be OK I guess.

Right, empty blocks could be SPV mining or secret ASICBoosting (something bitmain owns the chinese patent to).

The problem with increasing the base block size is that segwit doesn't fix quadratic hashing for legacy Bitcoin addresses. You will still be able to craft "attack blocks", which are blocks that contain a transaction that takes more than 10 minutes to validate, these can be done with a mere 2MB base block size.
It would require more backwards-incompatible fixes to prevent that. The two options we'd have is a hardfork that makes the existing Bitcoin address format obsolete, or a hardfork that fixes quadratic hashing in existing Bitcoin addresses. Segwit's quadratic hashing fix is the most studied by far, it seems like a bad idea to start working on a second fix for old addresses which certainly won't be as good as segwits.
So realistically we can either do:
softfork segwit with no base blocksize increase and support for legacy nodes and addresses. 
Or contentious hardfork segwit with base blocksize increase and no support for legacy nodes and addresses, 
meaning everyone will need to update their nodes and everyone will need to change their Bitcoin addresses.
I personally think the best solution to future on-chain scaling is extension block softforks, which segwit allows to do very safely. The problem is extension blocks are very new and not very well tested. This is why I think for now the 1.7-2mb segwit limit will have to do, and in the future we can use extension blocks to increase that.

Scrypt was developed by a software developer, not a cryptographer, [as a hobby project]( to secure passwords better, before litecoin picked it up. It was a highly complicated hash function with no sound design that makes it memory bound. It existed for a long time and nobody had made a GPU implementation for it, which was litecoins basis for choosing the algo. 40% of the hashpower of Litecoin was controlled by a single entity which many suspected was a botnet, however it was later found out that a Litecoin dev (ArtForz) had developed a GPU miner years before the first public one came out and many suspect he was this 40% miner and knew all along the algo was a sham and had used it in order to make money
My statement holds true however, you cannot develop an ASIC for a memory-bound function. Wrong tool for the job. Essentially RAM vs CPU. It's just that Scrypt isn't memory bound at all, even scrypt-n is on shaky ground. Cuckoo is the best we got right now, its a very simple addition to sha256.

I understand that point of view. However what happens when a better "optimization" comes out. The ASICBOOST "optimization" would allow for full hash collisions at 2^255.48. What if an "optimization" comes out that allows for full hash collisions with 2^61 on sha256. (which is what happened to SHA-1). In that scenario, mining is completely broken. When does it become an attack? To me, any "shortcut" that weakens security of the hash function (in this case from 2^256 to 2^255.48) would fit the definition of a cryptographic attack, and we should make it clear such attacks are not acceptable and will be patched. In the context of mining, any such attack allows a miner to prove they did work they did not do.

Yes that is their plan. They call it 'orphaning' the old chain, which is a 51% attack. The plan for Bitcoin all long since the day Bitcoin was created was, if there is a 51% attack, we need to change the PoW algorithm to something else to stop it. If a 51% attack is done, the PoW algo will be changed to SHA-3, and all current ASIC's won't be able to mine on the Core chain. This is bad as it punishes good miners as well as bad, but is the only solution for a 51% attack, it's the last option, the nuclear solution.
tl;dr; Bitcoin is not controlled by miners or devs. It is controlled by the economy, the people that accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods and services. Miners can make things very messy for Bitcoin in the short term, but they cannot change it without consensus from the economy.

You cannot develop an ASIC for a hash function that is truly memory-bound. Currently the best technology is cheap RAM that everyone has. Maybe in the future something better will come, who knows, but we don't foresee anything yet. The speed of the RAM or quality doesn't matter as long as it's above some minimal amount, it's the size in GB that matters. ASIC's are not able to solve memory-bound problems, because solving those require lots of memory (RAM), while solving sha256 requires a highly parallel processor, completely different thing. It would be highly unlikely that there would be specialized 'mining' RAM, as such RAM would only have better density, which is something every RAM manufacturer wants (more RAM in smaller space). and as such it would be unlikely Bitcoin companies or Bitcoin attackers would invest in R&amp;D for RAM.
I disagree that the network would be weaker. There will be lots more people mining, lots of botnets etc (even though this is bad, it makes the network a lot stronger). RAM is plentiful and requires almost no electricity to run (~1W/day/stick), enormous amounts of RAM would be used for mining.
The big issue is, are there any hash functions that are truly memory bound? We believe cuckoo cycle is, but this hash function is only 2 years old. To be sure it would need years of studying. But the good thing is, it's certainly not weaker than sha256 because it is sha256 under the hood, so it's reasonably safe to give it a shot for the purposes of mining, as if its not memory-bound, we'd be no worse off, we'd have something like 8x sha256 instead of 2x sha256, so basically the same.

No open source project releases unsigned, non-deterministic, closed source security patches other than BU. In many cases, doing that is illegal, such as if the code is licensed under GPL.
A big problem with doing it that way is if an attacker hacked the bitcoinunlimited website, he could release an unsigned, closed source binary that steals BTC and say it's a security patch and people would believe him.
Here's the full thoughts of Core on closed source binaries, they are currently drafting a document that explains in detail how they deal with security issues without releasing closed source patches.


by open source projects. There is no need to outright conceal the source
code from its users. Doing so is not particularly protective, and
could easily be the opposite of protective.


the past and used many techniques to deal with them, asking users to
run an opaque binary has never been a consideration for us.


which are critical to Bitcoin's value proposition and would be an   
unacceptable risk to users and developers alike.


their systems.  An interruption in service would be unfortunate but 
incomparably better than a loss of integrity.

It's not just the nodes. All old Bitcoin addresses (the ones we use that begin with 1) will have to be converted over to segwit addresses which start with bc.


They can propagate blocks (the 1MB block plus the segwit commitment). They just wont propagate/validate segwit transactions. Miners will still accept the old transactions if they pay a high enough fee. Most everyone should switch over, but if for example there is some automated system making payments and the owner is nowhere to be found, or a Bitcoin ATM that the owner can't easily update for segwit, it will still keep ticking along. If 99% of the economy switch over to segwit addresses, thats still $200 million using the old style addresses.

Only if you specifically activate the anti-theft functionality. It is done with your permission and knowledge, and on some android phones, locking the device requires a password known only to you, so Google cannot lock it themselves without your permission, they need your password.
Bitmains backdoor on the underhand was not known by people to be enabled and there was no option to disable it. The only way to disable it is to block bitmains server with your firewall.
If they wanted to add an anti-theft feature, they should have done what the good android phone manufacturers do, and have the owner set a password on the miner, and when the miner is stolen the owner gives the password to bitmain, who's server then sends the password to the miner and the miner shuts down. Then bitmain cannot shut down the miner without your permission, and it cannot be shut down by any MITM attacker either.

At least then it wouldn't be custom hardware, it would be widely available hardware. There are a lot more RAM manufacturers than mining ASIC's, it would be easier to obtain non-backdoored RAM. Personally I think it would lead to more mining decentralization and address many of the problems we're facing today in relation to mining. Also RAM only uses 1Whr/stick, the main cost of mining would be the investment in the RAM, so in theory there would be less energy consumption.

This calculator shows you the bare minimum. I don't think it takes into account bootstrapping new nodes. The minimum amount of peers to run a node safely is 8 (a non-listening node), which the calculator says 70GB/mo (thats not true, maybe if I put all the settings to a minimum). A listening node usually have around 100 peers. The calculator crashes when I type in 100.
The calculator says it themselves "This is an extremely complex topic with subtlety and nuance. Bandwidth from newly announced blocks is not the only consumption of bandwidth resouces. Transaction relay ,New nodes syncing old blocks ,Other consumers of bandwidth".
According to the minimum requirements section of bitcoin.org, you need 200GB upload bandwidth and 20GB download bandwith a month:
This is old however and its 300-400GB up and down combined right now.


What we don't want to do is sacrifice decentralization for more capacity.
Centralization = less privacy, security and anti-censorship. Ergo, you won't be able to donate to wikileaks anyway.
Very few people think we 'shouldn't' have onchain scaling. We just think it should be done safely. Right now 1MB blocks are already putting a strain on nodes. IBLT/weak blocks and sharding will all decrease the requirements of running a node dramatically. Once they are ready, we can safely increase the block size limit without sacrificing decentralization and there should be no reason to oppose this. Segwit allows for extension blocks, so the limit can be increased without doing a hard fork.


Well that already happened. Look at coinbase.
LN is only for microtransactions. In practice it only works for txes less than 0.042BTC. It allows us to do instant payments, and has the result of moving these txes off the chain to save some space.


If there is only a couple of nodes, those few nodes can co-operate and change monetary policy if they wish. No more 21 mill cap, inflation, no privacy, no security, coins being seized galore. It ends up worse than any other payment system. It would be PayPal without any regulation.

Yes litecoin activating segwit is really good. It'll show everyone how well segwit really works which will undo some of the brainwashing and FUD surrounding it and help get it through on Bitcoin.
And besides, worst case scenario that BU activates and manages to cripple Core chain, perhaps litecoin wouldn't be such a bad alternative.... It seems to me some people are just hell bent on splitting Bitcoin. Even some BU supporters are advocating for a split, as if that is good for anyone.
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:46:08
Yeah it looks like it would be a hardfork. Thats what was proposed in early 2015 when the first ASICBOOST paper was published. But the proposal was scrapped because: 1. It was believed asicboost was detectable, and there was no evidence of anyone using it 2. the main argument against it was the patent which may lead to mining centralization, but the centralizing effect may not be significant, you can't accurately predict what will happen 3. many people believe mining centralization to be a lost cause. 4. backwards incompatible protocol changes are seriously dangerous.
I still think it's a dangerous precedent that these kinds of things are allowed to continue working. What happens when there's another 30% increase, then another, then another, where do we draw the line? the argument will be made that "hey, you allowed that one, why are you blocking this one". People are also confused as to what asicboost does and some think it contributes security to the network.
I think the fact that covert asicboosting miners have a financial incentive to oppose some changes to the merkle root structure that prevent covert use is a different issue altogether. The fact it's patented is also a separate issue. The issue I'm really talking about is the fact we're seemingly OK with this kind of "optimization". When an "optimization" comes around that allows for full hash collisions at 2^61, will we not patch it "because its just an optimization"?

Where did the person originally obtain the coins from? the source could have identifying information about them.
Did the person only make one transaction this way, or did they make others? can those other transactions be tied together? if so, then a better profile of the user can be deduced, times they visit the coffeeshop etc
Does the person have a different computer that they use at home? if so, when configuring their second hand computer, did they do so in a way that is similar to their home computer? for example, if they installed Mandrake Linux, Firefox 17 with adblock plus https everywhere noscript and cookies+cache set to expire when closed, Electrum 2.14 configured to use multisig addresses and connect to a specific electrum node they trust, set the username on their secondhand laptop to "frosty" and the language to Esperanto. If they had a relatively unique setup on both machines, that could link them together.
How secure is the secondhand computer? if compromised, the attacker could turn on the webcam or microphone if they have not been removed, or they could use the bluetooth or Wifi to probe for nearby devices, such as the users smartphone, and pull identifying information from it such as MAC addresses. If the bluetooth and Wifi have been removed, the Wifi router in the cafe may have logged the smartphones mac even if it didn't connect to the router.
Did the user write any messages on the computer? if so, then stylometry could be used to identify their writing patterns etc
Finally, software such as cortana for Windows 10 sends back identifying information to Microsoft such as voice samples. If the computer contains any software such as this, that data could be subpoena'd.
Remember, Ross Ulbricht was caught in a very similar situation to the one you described.

The problem is that no matter what, you need to get the price of gold/USD. That will have to be provided by some business/individual or group of. That entity will have the ability to lie about the price in order to manipulate the price of the cryptocoin, which they could use to trade against. No kind of smart contract can fix that, it has to trust some entity to give it the real price of gold/USD.
In theory it would be an excellent idea, but its just a fact that you can't do this in a trustless way, therefore it's pointless, why even use a blockchain at all if it needs a trusted entity to work, just use a normal database and have the trusted entity act as a bank.

Another more malicious way would be through a well orchestrated phishing attack. I could send an email posing to be huobi support and convince them to provide identifying information such as their ID for AML purposes.

Ok, since you asked, I spent a few minutes to see what I could find out about the donor.
This is the owners wallet
First thing I noticed is the donors wallet received one payment from huobi.com. Another payment came from btcc.com Now if I was the FBI I would subpoena huobi.com and btcc.com and see if they have any identifying information as I believe huobi require ID verification for users who make large deposits, which I assume the target does as the donor appears to have 500+BTC, unfortunately I am not able to do that.
So I followed the bulk of the funds. They funds came from a wallet which as 1000 BTC and was spliting those funds up into 10BTC pieces in march of 2014. This is the source wallet 
This wallet contained the address 1ARUZPth8TrqTwWxShcBMJRaYwti461zoU which a quick google search returned this bitcointalk account  Our first clue. This account has a chinese username xiacaiyong which makes sense considering he also used huobi a chinese bitcoin exchange, so the donor is likely chinese. Additionally, the website URL contains an MMMGlobal (ponzi scheme) referral link with the email address gdp970310 Googling shows that email address is used a lot to promote this ponzi scheme. So based on this 20 minute investigation I'm going to guess the donor is gdp970310  who is either a large benefactor or the owner of MMMGlobal.

Apple can remotely install updates to your phone without any user interaction and this cannot be disabled without jailbreaking. But thats fine as long you trust them to not abuse this power and keep it secure. But I wasn't specifically talking about Apple with that statement, but in general. Who knows what malicious features a new version of iOS/android/whatever may have, the ability to replace that OS or components of it is a security bonus in that sense. Yes in general a rooted device is less secure than one that isn't, however if you are rooting to remove a malicious feature, then obviously it's more secure.
I don't know if many people complain about Apple's sandboxing, indeed android has similar sandboxing, I think the complaint is the difficulty in sideloading apps that aren't approved by Apple. iOS and Bitcoin have definitely not had a good relationship. A few years ago Apple removed all the Bitcoin wallets from the app store. What if that were to happen again. There would be no way to use an spv Bitcoin wallet on iOS without jailbreaking.

The total number of Bitcoins (the currency) that will ever be created will not exceed 21 million.
The total number of Bitcoin addresses (similar to bank accounts) that can be created is approximately 2^160 (sidenote it's 2^256 for bech32 segwit addresses!), which is such a big number that it is pretty much impossible to create that many, so for all intents the maximum number of Bitcoin addresses is unlimited.

It's not that we don't want larger blocks, we want a safe blocksize limit. We should have the largest blocksize that is safe. We don't want some insane limit thats going to have a massive centralizing effect on the network and we don't want some super risky hard fork like Bcash - which for example, the entire Bcash blockchain could be wiped out by Bitcoin miners at any moment.
With segwit, there happens to be a neat hack to increase the blocksize limit without any risky hard forks. After about 3.7MB, you come to a point of diminishing returns when it comes to increasing the blocksize this way.
Segwit also fixes quadratic hashing which along with compact blocks makes it safe to increase the blocksize limit a bit without much of a centralizing effect. 
Therefore the current blocksize increase (rather it was a removal of the limit altogether and a replacement with blockweight) was done without a risky hardfork while minimizing the centralizing effect, and is safe.

If the coin is spam attacked, like Bitcoin occasionally is, then it will shit out 8MB blocks regardless of the actual usage. Though 8MB probably isn't that unsafe.

He's not spreading Bitcoin to ISIS, rather the people who have defeated ISIS, Rojava, a western-backed anarchist state, a decentralized federation, that spans northern Syria and Iraq and is made up of multiple ethnicities and religions all living peacefully side-by-side and they strongly believe in things such as gender equality. They are also the group that has taken most of ISIS's territory and arguably have done the most to defeat ISIS. Bitcoin is very useful to them as it allows them to bypass the Syrian embargo.
However, to be impartial, a few countries do not like Rojava. Turkey does not like Rojava mainly because they are occupying some of Turkeys territory and has branded a rebel army loosely affiliated with Rojava, the PKK, as a terrorist organization. Rojava's main army is the YPG and and YPJ, with the YPJ being the womens army. The YPG/YPJ are (were?) US funded. The PKK is alleged to have fought alongside the YPG and the YPJ on occasion. I don't know the full story behind the PKK.
But you really should look up some videos of life in Rojava and decide for yourself if these people are the bad guys. It is a very peaceful place where women are treated fairly and many kinds of people are living side-by-side in peace. Just a few days ago they had their first democratic elections and right now they are celebrating it all over Rojava. IMO Rojava is the key to peace in the middle east, and Bitcoin can help them get there due to the embargo.

A month ago when I worked this out, You could mine a block once every 6 months with 240TH/s, which is 17 antminers, worth about $21,000. A single block can do as many individual finney attacks as you want. One block could finney attack many different payments to every unconfirmed tx accepting merchant. The miner still receives all mining revenue as well as any extra revenue from the finney attacks.
Let say there are services that accept unconfirmed txes up to $50 and there are 2,000 of these services. Thats $100,000 per finney attack, $200,000 a year from $21,000 worth of miners. If the merchants are willing to accept more than one unconfirmed tx at the same time, then the figure gets much larger...

A malicious miner can fill up blocks with spam txes in order to attack the network by exhausting the bandwidth of nodes, making the network centralized and co-optable. This doesn't require a large amount of hashpower and can happen regardless of actual transaction amount. Maybe 8MB is safe, but this is in part why there needs to be a sane limit, you could see how this could be a serious problem with 1TB maxblocksize.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:25:20
Now that we have segwit, the blocksize limit has effectively been removed and been replaced with blockweight.
At the current blockweight, a block full of normal txes would be the equivalent of a 1.7MB blocksize, and a block full of multisig txes would be the equivalent of a 3.7MB blocksize. So 3.7MB is basically the new limit.

It was done through a "security update". Most modern OS's will automatically install security updates from the OS maintainer, iOS, android, linux, macOS or Windows. If you have automatic security updates turned on (or it is forced on), then you are trusting the OS maintainer not to pwn your shit. Use an OS with a maintainer that you trust won't do something malicious like this, or use an OS that lets you disable automatic updates.
But I do agree with you that not all android device manufacturers sell their phones without restrictions. However some do, and because many parts of android are open source many of the phones that are locked down usually get unlocked really well by the community, to the point you can replace the entire OS and avoid situations like this. In this case the note 7 kernel was open source, and the malicious update was a kernel update, so removing it was quite easy.
Had Apple done something similar to this with iOS devices, recovering the phone and ensuring it won't happen again would be much much harder.

You are correct that if segwit2x does not have economic majority, then it will eventually fail, however, even without economic majority it can cause serious disruptions to Bitcoin. If segwit2x has a majority hashpower, then those miners may decide to orphan blocks on the main chain, preventing any transactions from being made on it in an attempt to force users over to segwit2x. This is a 51% attack. This can only be done temporarily, as if this were to be sustained for a long period of time, then a POW change would have to be implemented. That could risk splitting the network into 3, legacy chain, segwit2x and the new chain. So you can see how things can get messy real quick.

That won't help much for a few reasons, a big one being [finney attacks]( Even though finney attacks require you to be able to mine a  block, you still get mining revenue from mining the block (the attack has zero cost), and a single finney attack can double spend many merchants at once. So if accepting unconfirmed txes became the norm, then someone with a fairly modest amount of hashpower could set up a "finney attack service" and double spend against every unconfirmed tx accepting merchant at the same time.
There are a few ways you could safely accept 0-confirm transactions:
1. [MtGox used to have a service called GreenAddress]( where if you sent a payment to someone from your MtGox account, that person could check if the sending address was a MtGox address, and if so MtGox assures they would not double spend that tx, so if you trusted them not to do that then you could safely accept unconfirmed GreenAddress txes from untrusted people. Something similar to this could be done with a multisig wallet (such as the wallet that is ironically also called GreenAddress).
2. LN payments are extremely difficult to double spend, so if/once we have a functioning LN this would be the perfect usecase.

It is cleartext, however there is a proposal to encrypt it:
The problem is that there isn't a decentralized way to verify keys. Tor uses centralized servers to do this for example. So even with this encryption proposal it would still be possible for active MITM attackers to attack unless you manually verify the keys and only connect to nodes whos keys you have verified. However the encryption would be useful for SPV wallets, and also would protect against passive MITM attackers.

I also recall that Bitcoin was removed from the official Ubuntu (or Debian?) repository because it gets updated too frequently. I don't know if this is in the "official" Xubuntu repository, but if it is, then it should be removed for the same reason Bitcoin Core was. The BU people can publish a PPA if they want.

Because it suggests using a checksum to check if you entered the right password. That checksum can be used by an attacker to bruteforce the password. A strong hash function with lots of key stretching would be much better than some basic checksum.


Not really, even without a checksum you can still bruteforce by checking each seed for a balance. I would think it would take a lot less than 0.1seconds to do each attempt, especially if you knew one of the addresses (EDIT: actually that would depend on the strength of the kdf used). Better to use a hash function that will take atleast 0.1seconds to compute, 3 seconds is a good tradeoff between unlock time and security.
Another issue is that the seed is unauthenticated, so it could be tampered with. A good AES implementation would make it tamper-proof.
Electrum's seed encryption uses AES + 100,000 rounds of sha256.

If those coins blocks started to get full like Bitcoin, then running a node would get more costly and the node count would start dropping, just like Bitcoin dropped from 60,000 listening nodes at it's peak to 6,000. If there are too few nodes the coin would be centralized.

I don't think fixing AsicBoost necessarily requires UASF. If 70% of miners are not using AsicBoost, then it would be in their financial interests to support a change blocking the other 30% of miners from using it. It depends on what % of miners are using it.

Well, if you plan on investing a life-changing amount of money in something, then you should take the time to understand it very well, all of the pros and cons and how to mitigate them.
If you were to keep your life savings in a bank account, then you should take the time out to evaluate all the risks, such as the liquidity of the bank, the protections you have against default, and how to protect yourself from fraud. The people of Cyprus learned this lesson the hard way when all amounts over 100,000euro were subject to seizures.
Multi-millionaires also run the risk of tiger kidnappings, where the family of the millionaire is kidnapped and the millionaire is forced to withdraw large sums of money, and as such need physical security to protect themselves from this.
Secondly the thing you are setting up here to protect your Bitcoin is an airgapped PC. These are used by corporations and governments to protect sensitive data. It can be used to protect any sensitive data you have, not just your Bitcoins
It's up to you what precautions you take to protect your Bitcoins. For most people not storing life-changing sums of money, they may feel the convenience of a hardware wallet outweighs the risk of a backdoor, and so may opt for that route. But if you do not feel that to be the case, such a backdoor can be mitigated, as I explained.

They were very interesting and often overlooked. They had decentralized file searching, something BitTorrent doesn't have. I think Bitcoiners can learn a lot from them. They're a good example of what can happen with multiple implementations and backwards-incompatible protocol changes. All of those initially used the same gnutella protocol, but all became forks due to each making incompatible changes due to disagreements on how to fix scalability and other issues, until the network got split into a million pieces and eventually fizzled out, even though Gnutella is still a good protocol.

I read that URL. If it is using your password as a salt, how does it know if you entered the right password? surely it will always compute a valid seed no matter the password, which would be confusing to users. They may be convinced they entered in the correct password but are actually looking at a different seed.
EDIT: nvm, it advises the software to store a checksum. Wouldn't that have to be written down too though? The checksum would also be useful for bruteforce attacks. I don't really like this system. Better to use AES with a strong hash function.

I think that the current situation with fees is not good at all. It breaks many use cases of Bitcoin. You can't expect people to buy something that costs $1 and pay a $3 fee. 
However a centralized system is always going to be more efficient than a decentralized one. The resource cost of a Bitcoin transaction is always going to be higher than that of Visa, and someone has to pay that cost.
I support on-chain and off-chain scaling. However I most definitely do not support sacrificing decentralization for more capacity, as decentralization is the ONLY thing that makes Bitcoin better than Visa. Without decentralization, all the properties that make Bitcoin better go out the window - full control of your money, privacy, security and anti-censorship.
I support the blocksize increase included in segwit as segwit fixes quadratic hashing among a number of other issues which makes it safe to increase the blocksize limit to 4MB without sacrificing decentralization. I will support other blocksize increases if they also include better scaling. I also think an off-chain system like Lightning is the best system for small transactions.

It's possible and something you should consider if you are storing a life-changing amount, but it is not so likely.
Any hardware can be backdoored to steal Bitcoin private keys, including computers or hardware wallets.
In my opinion, I think that it's more likely a Bitcoin hardware wallet would have a backdoor that is targetted to steal Bitcoins than a common PC would.
I also think the real risk is a targetted backdoor, where a backdoor is put into some hardware that has been ordered by someone known to have a lot of Bitcoin. A backdoor put into every device would likely be found by someone.
The best advice I would give would be to go into a store and pick up a laptop box off-the-shelf randomly and buy it. That way you can be fairly certain that there isn't a targetted backdoor in your machine. Every one of those laptops would have to be backdoored, increasing the risk of someone else finding the backdoor.
Use that machine as an offline wallet for electrum/armory. Additionally you can use it to read/write important documents, and store important PGP keys etc.
One risk with an offline wallet is how you transfer data back and forth. Electrum lets you do this using webcams and QR codes, but IMO it's a bit too inconvenient and also cannot be used to transfer files (which you SHOULD NOT do without A LOT of care).
If you use a USB stick, a file you transfer can get infected and used to spread the infection, but a second risk is that the firmware on the USB stick gets reflashed by a virus. This kind of attack is very rare, but it is known the NSA has the capability to do these kinds of attacks. There is a cool device that can protect you from this:
If you do plan to use a USB stick, have it be a dedicated stick that you only use on your online and offline PC, and get the smallest size you can (1GB is plenty).

It solves a few problems. The big one is that old Bitcoin addresses only have 160bits of security. This is a problem as due to the birthday paradox, we are likely to encounter a collision sometime. The new format uses full 256bit security, no risk of collisions. I believe the new format also saves some space per tx. It is also able to detect and correct typos in addresses.

Part of the HK agreement was that miners would not signal for classic on the mainnet (run any software on mainnet that was out of consensus with core, to be precise). The HK agreement was signed on Feb 21st 2016.

I mean, there has to be a server/device somewhere that is connected to the internet (or able to communicate with a machine connected to the internet) which is able to spend funds from those addresses. It could be that the server does not have the key material but uses some kind of hardware wallet, but that wouldn't make things much safer - if the server is rooted all funds stolen regardless of if the server has the key material or not as it has to be able to spend from them, and previous hacks on cold storage setups of large bitcoin businesses has shown us that their hot wallet servers have the key material.

If you look up a coinbase deposit address on the blockchain, you'll see they move the funds off an address within minutes of new funds being received, so clearly customers addresses are kept online.
The deposit addresses are part of the hot wallet, but no funds are ever stored in them for longer than a few minutes, ~90% of funds are kept in cold storage. However these tokens are accidentally being stored in these addresses. There is very little risk to handing over the pkey (except for example someone hacking a coinbase account and requesting the pkey to an address which the hacker knows will receive payments in the future, allowing the hacker to receive future payments to that address)

That still doesn't make sense as factoring 128bit RSA keys has been possible since the 90's and takes &gt;1 second on the average desktop PC. Thats why we use 2048/4096 bit RSA keys. In any case bitcoin uses ECDSA for transactions and AES is only used for encrypting wallet files. Neither of these depend on the ability to factor primes, and in fact ECDSA is hardened in further in modern bitcoin wallets by only publishing the hash of the public key and not publishing the public key itself until the output is spent, making it resistant to attack even with quantum computers as Shor's algorithm requires knowledge of the public key. The quantum computer would have to be able to crack a single key in less than 10 minutes (1 block) in order to be able to steal BTC from someone elses Bitcoin address.

What will the miners mine then? if all the big exchanges have moved to the new chain and the miners continue to mine on the old chain, who will buy the miners coins?
It reminds me of the first halvening, when the block reward dropped from 50BTC to 25BTC. One 'smart' miner decided to change his miner's code so that it continued mining 50BTC blocks, creating his own fork. He switched back in less than a day once he realized nobody would buy the coins he was mining, they were worthless.

That's true, but it's important to note UASF is very different to a MA fork. Hypothetically, if those 1000 UASF nodes belonged to all the big exchanges, businesses and hodlers, then the UASF would be successful. What really matters is what percentage of the Bitcoin economy is using a UASF node. That is a very difficult thing to measure, which is one reason why UA forks are considered riskier than MA forks. However even a MA fork requires backing from the economy, in a MA forks the miners 'activate' the new rules but the rules are enforced by the nodes, and for enforcement to work those nodes must represent a large percentage of the economy. A MA fork can fail if it is not backed by enough of the economy just like a UA fork.
