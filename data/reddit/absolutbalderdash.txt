what else do you propose to do with your bitcoin, just let it sit and never cash out?

That’s false. Clearing 900 a month with 6 GPUs.

Not to be that guy - but comon is not slang.

Huge dump? Variations within 1-2k over the timeframe of a day or two is 100% normal.

I disagree. There will always be more people coming into the bitcoin world. It can be thought as similarly to say, facebook. There were early adopters, then more people starting using it as they heard of it, and now most people have facebook but there are still people (even my parents who are in their 50s) just started using it recently even though it's been mainstream for 10 years now.

Too young? Man put out cant stop the feeling for the trolls soundtrack less than two years ago, and that song was HUGE. It's possible he doesn't know about NSYNC or a lot of early JT songs but I'm sure he's heard of him.

But if he sells it there would have to people buying still, the BTC would still be in the ecosystem. How would this tank bitcoin?
Edit: what's up with this subreddit? Downvoted for asking a legitimate question, you're not very welcoming here are you.

You know people trade fiat currencies too right? It’s called Forex.

That’s a backronym.

Sorry for nitpicking but this graph makes no sense. Both lines are reflecting # of daily HODL comments, since this is just one X and Y axis. If you wanted to do this properly you should put an additional Y axis on the right with values of BTC/USD.

I’d argue that going to an online community for the tech in question and asking people for advice is usually a good place to start
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:12:28
Vs bits, which literally stems from the word bitcoin. it’s very intuitive IMO.
