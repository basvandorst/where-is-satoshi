Come over her boys and girls, grandpa and grandma. I have a story to tell about bitcoins. Unfortunately, I can't tell you what bitcoins are and what they do and how they work in just 5 words. Just like grandma can't tell why she loves grandpa in just 5 words. I mean, she could ... but it would not be fair to grandpa. Surely he deserves more then 5 words! As so does this story. Buckle up, we are going to talk ... money. 
Bitcoin is a another way of doing what money does. Instead of having paper money and bank accounts bitcoin has the blockchain. This is a very big book  full with names of people and how much bitcoins they have under their name. Let's say Alice wants to buy something from Bob that will cost 10 bitcoin. Alice will have to let the bookkeeper know and the bookkeeper will update the book, writing "Alice -10" and "Bob +10".
Of course it's not very convenient to call the bookkeeper every time you want to buy something. But we already do that by getting money from the ATM machine when we want to buy a coffee (or maybe a frappuccino) . The bookkeeper in that story is just a computer that is connected over the internet to a very big computer somewhere at the big bank, where the big book is.  Now there was a wise guy in Japan who thought long and hard about this. And he saw some problems. He saw that the bookkeepers had more power over the money of Alice and Bob then Alice and Bob had themselves. When the bookkeeper says no, it's no and there is not much you can do about that!  There is no freedom in that, thought the wise Japanese guy, just a few that have control over many!  Why don't we split up this big computer at the bank and instead use Alice and Bob their computers at home? If we make all the computers in the world work together then they can also keep the book, just like the big computer at the bank. And then the big computer at the big bank, and the people that own the big computer and make it do what they say, can't decide the faith of the many anymore! But wait ... thought the wise Japanese guy ... what if Bob's computer changes the book in his favor and Alice her computer wants  to change the book in her favor? Then we would have two books and the numbers in there would conflict! I wonder, thought the wise Japanese guy ... if I can come up with a system that will make it impossible for anybody to do this ... or if not impossible ... at least so insanely hard that nobody will ever even try it, like making a full size eiffel tower out of balloons and hedgehogs. And that's what the wise Japanese guy did. But being a very wise guy ... he wanted to remain anonymous. When you say things that people don't like, sometimes they want to come over to your house and shout nasty things at you. But if they don't know where your house lives then they can't do that! That's what it means to be anonymous. And so likewise the wise guy in our story was afraid that the old bookkeepers would not like his invention very much. After all the world would have less use for them, just like these ladies that use to connect you when you called somebody on the phone lost their jobs after machines took over. And so he called himself; John Doe. But he was japanese and John Doe in Japanese is ... Satoshi Nakamoto.
Mister Nakamoto worked long and hard, and finally he completed his work: [The Blockchain!]( 
I am going to explain how the blockchain works, but be warned. Although every small part of the blockchain is not so hard to understand, the complete blockchain is very complex. Just like one little gear in a clock is easy to understand, but how do hundreds of these little gears form a working clock? What does that one do? And this one? Which little gear keeps track of time? Well, it's all of them. They work together. And so it is with the blockchain, there are many little blocks and they all work together and form a chain. The blockchain. 
I am stopping right now, because I need to get dressed and look for a job. But I will finish this epic story of cleverness, ingenuity and a bit of sushi or my name is not LibrarianLibertarian!
Because they said that nobody [could explain what the matrix was]( But maybe they just sucked at explaining. So in the spirit of Richard Feynman and by the wise saying of Albert Einstein; if you understand something but can't explain it so others can understand it to... well then you don't understand it at all! 
This might take a while and many revision and a way to find anologies for very complex math (Public Key Cryptography using clock aritimitsc can be explained by mixing colors like [this video]( does.) But it can be done and I will do it! It's about time to make a decent ELI5 for the blockchain and the bitcoin ecosystem.

They like bitcoin but are afraid to admit and name things as they are. But all this blockchain talk is just bitcoin by the backdoor ... so what's the problem. Like a certain guy likes to say; it's a new technology, it works, it can't be uninvented so it won't go away anymore. Patience is key. (also the internet, that's only as old as a teenager and won't be around forever in the current form either. Another world war could kill the current internet and also the first  successful blockchain implementation)

How much sales in Bitcoin have you made? 
@_date: 2016-02-02 13:49:53
Just be patient. Like Andreas M. Antonopoulos likes to say: "the technology behind bitcoin can not be uninvented" 
We now know that consensus in zero trust networks are kind of possible. Email was invented in the seventies but it took around 25 years before mainstream use. However we can't really compare bitcoin use with email use because bitcoin has to do with money and email by itself not so much. In the future the technology that bitcoin has brought along will be used more and more. Most of the implementations will fail. That could include bitcoin, however in the near future this seems unlikely because the huge amount of money invested in to bitcoin and bitcoin mining. Eventually the current monetary system that the west has made the dominant one in the world, together with capitalism will be replace by another one. Since bitcoin technology now exists this will logically have some influence on the next system. So all by all you just have to wait for 20 - 30 years. In the end it probably won't be called bitcoin and it might not even be bitcoin but a totally different cryptocurrency (all though everybody that has invested in to bitcoin will fight this) but in the next 30 years a digital currency will go mainstream and become the global one, just like email has replaced most of the letter we use to write. Because it's a better system. Better systems  always win, it just takes a while. Unless some unforeseen catastrophic events happen but in that case the internet might go down too.

Just one bit? Saving up for a byte? 
@_date: 2017-10-03 05:15:01
So it's wrong of people not be able to predict the future? How many people with bitcoin sold most of them when the first peak happened? When the second peak happened? 
 It's not like there have not been any failed currency attempts. And yeah Bitcoin is still a high risk thing to invent in, in comparison with something like an IRA. 
You can't blame these people, especially if they are not tech savy. In 20 years maybe we can make fun of bankers that fought crypto and lost but regular people trying to find a save investment we should leave alone.

This really makes a lot of sense. A lot of things come together in this. Thank you. Let's see when the big turn around comes and slowly Bitcoin (or something exactly the same but called differently) becomes the world's currency. Interesting times ahead. (next 15 - 20 years)

So you don't use any software because you never know if there are going to be security holes? 
@_date: 2015-03-14 11:54:30
If I were Satoshi I would not go to work tomorrow. I would stay home and count my bitcoins all day long. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:11:14
What security issues and bugs does 2.2.1 have? The only bug I know of is the 100% overload disk-bug and that one is not really a bug, and is easy to fix. In the private torrent tracker scene 2.2.1 is the most used client on windows. There are some big trackers out there that don't allow clients like qbittorent (because qbittorent can stream and they don't like that).
Anyway; 2.2.1 is a very small, lightweight and efficient torrent client; exactly the original idea of utorrent. There is nothing wrong with using it and if you think there is something wrong with it you will have to show me. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:14:26
2.2.1 has no known security issues. There are probably exploits but I have never encountered one and neither have any of my private torrent trackers (if it would leak the identifier all big trackers would ban it). It does have the disk 100% overload problem, but there is way to work around that. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:51:26
But I am not  Satoshi 
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:06:14
Yes because programs never make mistakes, every update is always better than a previous one. 
/sarcasm mode off.
We are not talking about an operating system here, or even a browser. We are talking about a torrent client.  Give me three valid attack vectors that can work attacking a computer through a torrent client so I know you have an idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 19:18:53
Yes, and in the torrent community 2.2.1 is considered save. 
CHDBits.org is one of the better private torrent tracker websites, these guys are chinese. If anybody is paranoid and have an incredible set of rules for their members it's these guys. qbittorent is not allowed because it allows streaming and if everybody downloads chunks in the same order the availability suffers. 2.2.1 is the last utorrent version that is allowed as client. Same with HDBits.org and many others. I am a member on both CHDBits and HDBits. I also am a member at HD-Torrents where I can use qbittorrent, and I like to use it because then I can stream. 
Anyway, does not know what he is talking about. You don't have to update calculator software because of "security issues". A torrent client is not an offline program, but still the attack vectors you have at a browser are exponential compared to a torrent client. utorrent 2.2.1 is a lightweight, non bloated, very small and portable and fast torrent client and that's why it is still used too much. It only lacks some functionality but not everybody needs that functionality. The longer a program is known without any new builds, the better you can know if it's save. In this case, there are no exploits for utorrent 2.2.1 that are actively being used. It that was the case all these private torrent tracker communities would have put it on their ban list.

Not all characters are valid in bitcoin addresses. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:34:53
"Most Bitcoin addresses are 34 characters. They consist of random digits and uppercase and lowercase letters, with the exception that the uppercase letter "O", uppercase letter "I", lowercase letter "l", and the number "0" are never used to prevent visual ambiguity.
Some Bitcoin addresses can be shorter than 34 characters (as few as 27 in theory) and still be valid. A significant percentage of Bitcoin addresses are only 33 characters, and some addresses may be even shorter. Every Bitcoin address stands for a number - somewhat like an account number. These shorter addresses are valid simply because they stand for numbers that happen to start with zeroes, and when the zeroes are omitted, the encoded address gets shorter.
Several of the characters inside a Bitcoin address are used as a checksum so that typographical errors can be automatically found and rejected. The checksum also allows Bitcoin software to confirm that a 33-character (or shorter) address is in fact valid and isn't simply an address with a missing character."
