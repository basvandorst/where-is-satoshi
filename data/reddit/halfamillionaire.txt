Obv. throwaway here.
As no-one is likely to appear...
Not a millionaire, just an (USD) half-a-millionaire here. Is that enough?
my story, with what I consider to be my smart and dumb moves:
Played a bit with it in early 2011, understood its potential [SMART]
Didn't have the guts to say "buy 10000 btc, keep them" [DUMB]
Paid stuff with it [SMART]  (like spending 20 btc to host a website) [yikes, it hurts but I still say it was SMART]
Lost 30% in MtGox [DUMB], was left with &lt;50 at the 2013 bubble, that was the moment I realized: I must get serious with it, but I'll wait [SMART]
Bought more at the $400 dip [SMART]
Bought more at the $250 dip of 2015 [SMART]
As per my plan, when it got to $1000 (end 2016) I sold all I needed to re-coup all of my investments. I know my BTC are all paid for now. [SMART]
I needn't spend them to live, I already own my house, I am holding, and do not plan to do anything with them [SMART]
I don't allow that money to change the way I live, apart from the feeling I have a "safety net" that I can use in case of danger [SMART]
Also, I live in one of those "socialist" (/s) countries in Europe where we have one of those "socialist" (/s) health care plans. I know that even in case of illness, my family won't be bankrupt and I won't need to touch my BTCs. [SMART]
All in all, I feel that I have my retirement there, and PERHAPS a nicely-sized estate to pass on to my kids.
Of cource, your idea of what was SMART and what was DUMB might differ form mine, but that's how  I see it.
TLDR: I feel smart and dumb at the same time
