Absolutely comical that you are defending this guy.
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:07:01
Because hes a scumbag shill trying to pump his own bags.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:48:23
There isnt a single one with a worse record.  He has been absolutely dead wrong for the last 2+ years.
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:24:21
Hes been literally stone dead wrong on every call in both bull and bear markets over the last 3 years. Why would anyone listen to him anymore?
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:23:23
He literally could not have been more wrong on his calls.  Its not possible to be more wrong.
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:09:11
Imagine supporting someone who cites "magicpoopcannon" analysis on TV as a reason to be bullish.  Lmfao, only in crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-13 10:16:10
Imagine taking a victory lap from this.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:33:37
The ole "it happened before it has to happen again" argument.
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:31:38
Was tour younge also in your cheek when you incorrectly predicted the bottom for the last 9 months?  If someone did the exact opposite of what you said for the last 9 months they would be filthy rich.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:21:41
This is the convenient part every bull seems to be leaving out.
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:08:39
This guy has been shilling people to "buy the dip" since 20k.  On Thursday he also said that BTC would be at 10k by Monday.  He has been dead wrong in every prediction for the last year, I really hope everyone ignores him.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:34:16
I'm super bearish rn but this is the dumbest comment Ive read in months.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:12:35
There is actually a good chance this comes to fruition.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:16:44
Wtf are you talking about...nobody was buying at 5k.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:49:31
Bakkt is a meme, how do you not see this.  People like you have been calling for muh institutions for years....
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:07:17
And when you're dead wrong like always will you stop making incorrect predictions?
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:29:25
a meme
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:48:49
Why does every naive hopium smoker think BTC is going to rise exponentially forever?  I'm sorry you missed out, but we had our golden bull run.  
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:26:43
Guy with massive interest in thing says thing is valuable.  SHOCKING.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:41:39
Reminds me of a Pomp shill post.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:05:05
They literally think Bitcoins are physical coins.  People upvote this trash?
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:23:34
Iran is not going to use Bitcoin to bypass sanctions, they are going to use their own state backed crypto.  Which is good actually, because if they used BTC it would be a literal black swan event that killed BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:20:08
People holding onto this as hopium are absolutely delusional.  
@_date: 2019-01-28 09:57:10
He has finally capitulated and realized that the price isnt going up anytime soon.  It's about time little buddy.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:53:25
Wow noob spotted.  
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:00:57
You just proved that your thesis is worthless.  BTC has been around for 10 years...how much adoption? little.  How many killer apps?  ZERO.  Truth hurts.
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:32:20
Yes I do.  2018.
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:24:12
Another meme wrt price.
@_date: 2018-11-15 10:50:17
What do you even know about the "technology"? Cringe
@_date: 2019-01-29 09:19:42
Lol it has passed early adoption.  I'm sorry you missed out on your chance to become a millionaire, you wont get the same chance again.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:15:36
Nobody cares.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:43:18
There are no solutions yet people will try to cope with some asinine responses.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:59:02
Memes will not save you 
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:57:19
Well that solves it guys.  We are gonna be rich!
@_date: 2019-01-13 07:53:15
Because greed is a hell of a drug.
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:22:13
Why do people post this meme chart?  Best case scenario it will show $3500 LOL.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:10:06
THIS.  The "positive" news is literally all memes.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:07:46
Who cares, it means nothing.
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:49:51
Guys who have massive stake in crypto success predict that something positive will happen.  Shocker.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:51:57
Diydude just called 20k by March LOL.  Posting this for when he later deletes.  He has literally been dead wrong about every call over the last year.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:06:47
Not even mildly interesting.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:54:32
You *hope* it had run its course because you are a noob investor who bought in 2018!  I'm sorry you missed out buddy, but you will not be getting rich off bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:28:51
Bakkt is a meme wrt to positive movement in price.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:08:49
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:30:26
Still calling for 10k BTC by Monday? �� (For anyone not aware this guy said BTC would be 10k by Monday in Bitcoinmarkets)  Everything he says is utter nonsense.
@_date: 2019-01-13 08:02:23
It's pretty obvious what's coming next by taking a 5 second look at this chart.
You guys missed your chance to become millionaires...time to move on.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:02:18
If you are asking, its certainly not profitable for you.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:15:14
Lmao this is the delusion that has destroyed so many people over the last year.  Muh math.
@_date: 2019-01-13 08:18:31
Maybe in 50+ years, and no it wont be Bitcoin they are switching to.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:44:56
Survive? We are -85%+. Not sure how that is survival.  Yes, we all perished in the longest bear market in history.  Congratulations.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:03:08
This is literally nothing.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:05:59
Bakkt doing absolutely nothing positive for the price will be the biggest letdown since the initial crash of '18.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:55:50
Hopium smokers will say yes.  However they will ignore the fact that BTC has been out for 10 years will minimal adoption and not a single killer app.  It's not like the internet AT ALL.  It's a niche.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:08:24
Actually no, its regressing in nearly every way.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:35:13
Why do you assume BTC is supposed to increase over Fiat over time? It's a speculative bubble...these things dont last forever.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:07:14
This is not a breakthrough lmfao.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:51:51
Another meme that hopium smokers think will save them.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:21:37
Another dead wrong prediction.  You sticking by your prediction of 7k Friday?
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:35:22
JAB and MW are both terrible options for a 1k suit.  
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:51:53
This should be upvoted to eternity and all the hopium threads can stop.
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:40:29
Why does everyone say this will be the biggest bullrun ever?  It likely will cause a brief small short term spike and then things will be back to normal.  Have you even read the ETF?  It doesnt entitle the owner to Bitcoin itself, just Bitcoin stock.  Be prepared for more manipulation.
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:42:23
We won't.  All the hopium and delusion is from people who haven't even looked at the details of the proposed ETF.
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:32:57
Lol the Oracle makes another horrendously wrong prediction.  When he is dead wrong he wont mention it and proceed to make more horrendously incorrect predictions.
@_date: 2018-12-13 04:54:47
LOL.  After an 80%+ crash he said we are in a fake bear market and people have been unsuccessful in shorting.  LMFAO
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:43:14
It's hilarious how people neglect this.
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:38:30
The log chart is the last meme piece of hopium that bulls will have to grasp on.  Even when we fall sub 1k they will be posting this.
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:06:04
So the market was healthy when shitcoins like Dentacoin had a marketcap of over 1 billion?  OK
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:02:41
This is a clear rounding top, I dont understand why more people dont mention it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:41:39
This.  Why do the bulltards assume this will go up indefinitely?  Paper futures killed BTC, just like they did with Gold.
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:26:59
You have been saying this exact same thing for over a year now LOL.
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:36:37
Hes getting scared.  Last week it was "6k by Christmas". This week its 2 years.
@_date: 2018-12-03 12:24:24
This is a great post and all perma bulls who equate BTC to the early days of the internet should read this.
