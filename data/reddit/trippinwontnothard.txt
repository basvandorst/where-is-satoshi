sorry, but i really don't think that's fair.  i have been to that site every now and then, i'm not a regular by any means, but it's clear to me that they have a very unique selection of products.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with a business making money.
don't be such a cheap asshole
edit: maybe that's a little harsh
