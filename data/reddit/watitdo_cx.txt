I do. I just fail to see how batching the transactions make any difference. Wow, all those transactions come from coinbase.. So what?
Oh, and I think that you don't realize that past (and future) transactions that other users have sent from coinbase might link your transaction(s) to coinbase too.
Let's pretend that both of us send 10 bitcoins to coinbase. Now coinbase doesn't want to keep all 20 bitcoins in a hot wallet (a wallet that is online), so they send 15 btc to a cold wallet (this wallet has never been on a computer that has been online).
Okay, so coinbase has 5 btc in their hot wallet. I now send 2 btc and announce that those coins came from coinbase. Now you decide to send 1 btc somewhere.
If someone now checks the block explorer, they will easily be able to link those two transactions together, since your transaction used the remainder of the coins that I previously sent.
In reality the transaction will most likely consist of multiple smaller inputs, many of which could be remainders of previous coinbase transactions.
Don't count on the fact your transaction can't be traced back to coinbase. Even if it is anonymous at the time you send it, it might be possible to trace it back if your transaction left any amount of bitcoin unspent (that is later used in someone else's transaction).

yes, so what?

And there are valid reasons for mining empty blocks. For example, another pool finds a block, antpool gets the header information and starts mining on that without having downloaded the actual block data.
They could either sit around and wait for the block data to be downloaded or try to mine an empty block. They'll switch over to mining a non-empty block as soon as the data has been downloaded.

Or did they just find someone willing to say that?

Actually the impact of each halving is exponentially lower each time. The majority of the coins are already mined. It's going to take another 100+ years to mine the remaining coins.

I'll take your property. It's my turn to use it. :)

I agree. Besides, your could swap the whole site to another one by DNS trickery, even if the site was encrypted.
Anyway  encryption has been made free by  so there really isn't any reason not to do it.
