I use LBC and GreenAddress, using these together for me is near instant.

In 2140 once all BTC have been mined, what will this mean for miners, their only income would be the TX fees, correct?
Would we start to see a shift in miner capacity or business models before this time has come to remain profitable, will it even be profitable to be a miner at with this income? 
Or will large scale mining operations slowly switch off and make it a lower entry into mining again for the average home miner?

I use LocalBitcoins, have used two different traders, both were pretty quick and hassle free as I chose to bank transfer with same bank. 
One of the traders required ID upfront, the other doesn't need ID for weekly buy ins of less than $300.

bitnz has effectively shutdown as an exchange:
"  Due to NZ banks "de-risking" (see  BitNZ will be unable to take NZD deposits from 23/11/2015  "

As a new trader myself, I would suggest to reconsider:
Centralised Exchanges = KYC+AML
LocalBitCoins = No KYC+AML - well with that one trader I found with limits.
As far as I have learnt and reading a vast pool of posts of people having a absolute nightmare of a time dealing with KYC+AML, more with withdrawing. 
Dealing with that, to me anyway, seems like a multitude more hassle than simply sending someone fiat and getting BTC back, such as LBC.
But each to their own I suppose, all the best with what ever method you use.  
Just my meagre 2c worth.

No centralized exchanges like Coinbase that I'm aware of in NZ, I doubt we will ever see this unless banking regulations allow for such services here. Which is somewhat unlikely but who knows what the future will bring.
Other than that, the only ones I can think of at the top of my head would be LBC &amp; BitSquare.

These transactions may be stuck in the now massive Transaction Mempool that increased in a massive spike in the past 48 hours.
It will eventually confirm, no idea when sorry.
