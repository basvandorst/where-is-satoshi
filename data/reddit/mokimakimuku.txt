Hm, the transaction volume was one of the hottest topics in 2014. It was pointed out as proof that Bitcoin was going to the moon. 
Why is this article completely ignored? Shouldn't this be on top of the mainpage so we can discuss this?
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:30:32
I've seen the hotline number posted and many idiotic "what's happening  to the price" posts. You simply didn't look for them because you're trying to make an extremely bearish situation bullish. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:16:06
Yes we know. You can stop shouting. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:14:20
Holy shit. You're getting more crazy and paranoid with each reply. Poor guy. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:25:45
What the hell? I'm not spreading fud?!
He asked for a personal opinion and i gave a personal opinion. I personally think the transaction times are an issue. And i get downvoted to fuck for that?
There is something seriously wrong in this sub. Some people really should get their voting behavior in check. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:35:48
Yes we get it. 50 people before you posted the same thing. As soon as we go down the price isn't important anymore. It's all about the protocol. But when we go up 50 bucks this place is one big "to the moon" circle jerk.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:18:08
The confirmation time obviously. 
Hilarious how i'm getting downvoted to hell for answering a question asked by the OP. This place...
Apparently i'm only allowed to answer it with something positive everyone agrees with. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:37:13
Because now it's REALLY cheap. And next week really REALLY cheap. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:47:21
Unreadable. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:56:24
Bitfinex is a huge problem for Bitcoin. 
That place basically exists to make people money by pushing the price down. 
They are a big part of the downtrend. If that place would close the price would recover instantly. 
And why would the bearwhale seek revenge? He sold his coins and people paid him the price he was asking. 
That guy is sipping pina colada's on the beach right now. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:45:45
Cringe post of the day. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:35:06
Pick a random % and it will be as accurate as any answer you will get. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:40:33
On the fact that he owns coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:09:23
Yeah. I should've know better. Sorry. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:18:17
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:16:24
Where do i attack Bitcoin? Wtf?
I own coins. Why the hell would i attack it?
You paranoid kids have some serious issues. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:22:33
Look up one of the 10 similar threads from today with random guesses.  
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:01:14
You wanted a currency without regulation and government involvement. You wanted a free market. 
Well, you got one. 
Ah, look at the downvoters going nuts. When reality slaps them in the face. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:33:11
You understand Bitcoin? What's that supposed to mean? You know something the rest of the world doesn't?
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:39:51
I see you're getting desperate. What's the problem? Not getting rich off your 0.5 Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:35:17
Funny how every week i see another reason why we will go up soon. Yet we've been going down for a year. 
So this week the keyword is regulations?
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:25:17
Where did you buy that crystal ball?
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:04:24
Yes. So bullish. 
How rich have these charts and lines made you already?
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:05:29
Take your anti paranoia meds. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:41:31
Stop shouting you idiot. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:34:37
I read that same advice at 600. I see that worked out well for those who were "greedy". 
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:39:01
Yeah ok. Tell that those who used that advice and were greedy at 600. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:42:59
Hey, they have to pull in those clicks somehow. And it won't be because of their great journalism. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:47:10
Just people getting out. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:54:45
Indeed. I just learned that regulation is needed and wanted so the prices will go up. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:36:55
This is a sign they most likely have a big problem and don't know how to communicate it. It's damage control. 
And if damage control means not opening your mouth instead of telling what's wrong it usually is bad. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:46:37
We know. We have also access to charts. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 01:14:22
Yes i realize that now. Sorry for insulting the holy Satoshi. 
The only acceptable answer to op's question is: nothing, it is perfect already. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:08:42
People still believe in this smart money buying cheap coins thing?
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:29:40
Just post in one of the 10 existing topics about this man. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:16:19
That's not how it works. You make the claim, you provide proof. Not: you make the claim and ask others to disprove it.
But obviously someone like you is not interested in this as you're just here to make sensationalist claims. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:02:55
If i understand correctly from the title you are not worried because you know the price will recover again? And that is because you understand Bitcoin? Is that correct?
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:26:47
Jesus dude, at least scan the forum before posting. It has been the top news for 8 hours or so already. Next to at least 50 posts about it. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:33:40
Who here exactly is supposed to answer that?
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:19:00
They said exactly the same thing at 600. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:11:19
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:40:47
Why are you asking this here? This is a Bitcoin sub. You might want to check out a financial sub. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:16:22
You should worry less about the usd collapse, which isn't happening and focus more on the Bitcoin collapse, which is happening. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:43:08
Why would they? So far the price is going down without them having to do anything. 
Why all the downvotes??
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:52:21
Huh? No?
Anyway, where is your source? Or should i have an old account to be allowed to ask such a question?
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:24:14
Yeah. Just look at all these new people buying. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:42:50
At 1000 the distribution is just as fair. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:52:40
Take your meds. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:13:48
Welcome to the internet. Your first day here?
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:38:42
I recently saw a post explaining that if it's positive for Bitcoin it should be allowed and when negative then not. 
Edit: downvoted because i mentioned i saw that post. Seriously. What's wrong with you people. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:12:00
These kind of posts are some of the most annoying things people do on forums. Especially in caps. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:04:22
How the hell are we supposed to know? Do you even think before posting? What goes on in your head when you post something like this?
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:14:37
How is anybody here supposed to know exactly? As far as i know time travel still doesn't exist. 
Edit: downvoted why??
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:13:57
Your first day on the internet?
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:28:01
People used that advice also at 600. And i've seen it posted at about every price level. 
And even now you have no idea if it will go down more. 
So no, there is nothing useful about it. And all these investing quotes are usually posted by young people who have no clue about trading. That's why you see it posted here so much. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:22:56
I'm a Bitcoin supporter just like the next guy here. But because i don't fully join the circle jerk people like him will call me a statist. It's sad indeed. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:34:24
Eat a snickers. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:13:36
Sure sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:09:07
Well, look at it this way. Basically every person in the last 12 months who decided to buy based on advice from this sub lost money. 
If he thinks it will go up then buy. Otherwise don't. 
Nobody here will be able to tell you anything else. 
Edit. Downvoted because?
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:13:26
Yes. Of course. What else. The price going down is actually good for Bitcoin. Let's celebrate. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:27:08
So you're telling strangers to buy something that has been going down for a year based on your belief it will go up again? Nice. 
Everyone who listened to people like you in the last 12 months lost money. At what point will you start realizing this?
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:24:56
A personal opinion is a buttcoin circle jerk? Wtf?
Take your anti paranoia meds kiddo. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:24:38
No. You just don't understand it. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:31:02
Get a normal job and just buy coins. You'll be able to buy more coins in a week than in 6 months earning them through websites. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 10:54:05
Supposed by who?
