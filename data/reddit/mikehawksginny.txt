I didn't know that. Are you sure? Because if I have x amount on Binance wallet. Make a few trades. I can cash out from that particular address. That's a real btc address moving value around. These transactions (or trades) should be on the blockchain. Right? or am I mistaken?
Honest question, not trying to be a wise-ass.

I see. Thank you for clearing this up.
So to clarify. If I turn 1 btc into 100 over a few months with 100x leverage on Bitmex. They would create a transaction only into my designated wallet only when I want to cash out?

Meh. Visa doesn't process trading volume. 
Not really a fair comparison.

I'm not sure yet if this is cringey or hilarious. Depends on whether you can pull it off I suppose.

Actually I just got into high leverage trading and it's addicting as fuck. Gambling for sure, but damn what a rush.
Craps table won't feel the same after this.

If they have a background in investing, they will always be interested in emerging markets with high risk/high return. If they happen to have a shit ton of money sitting around, have followed the technology sector, and were a part of the dot-com bubble, they will definitely be able to see the potential of blockchain. I know a few older guys who waited for the bubble to pop, and have been waiting to get a piece of the action. Most got in in April, which was too early in hindsight, but I digress. 
The elite aristocracy love capitalism and the allocation of capital. It's what made them rich in the first place.

Not sure. Wasn't my intention. These things happen.
