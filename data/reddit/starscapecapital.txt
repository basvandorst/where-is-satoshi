Possibly for bitcoin (though I don't think so), but the alt bull market appears to be persisting as alts slowly detach themselves from BTC pricing tethers.

Is your proposed alternative putting money that you can't afford to lose into the market until you need it? That could end badly, better to just invest extra funds even if it's just $30 here and there

If you had included a referral link in your post -
1) it's not there
2) you should disclose that it's a referral link

It's strange seeing market movements externalized to some 'other', like 'whales' or 'the Asians' in this case. An entire continent can't agree on anything, much less which cryptocurrency to systematically pump.

I will be day trading more. I know HODLing is the battle cry, but volatility is a trader's best friend and these markets deliver that in spades

I have used it for online purchases, although funnily enough bitcoin is not as good for that as it used to be, given slow transactions and altcoins that are more suited to the purpose.

Good to hear that Youbit investors are likely to recover their funds. We've come a long way from the Mt. Gox days.
