Oh good, now we too can get to experience the joys of quote stuffing, flash orders, and my favorite, having the exchange roll back all of the "erroneous" trades when one of their crony's HFT bots goes berserk.
No thanks; fortunately since there's no central clearinghouse for bitcoin the non-HFT users aren't stck putting up with this shit, at least until the non-wall street exchanges are all declared illegal in the US&lt;/tinfoilhat&gt;

haha yeah, his body language was so aggressive, I wasn't sure what to make of it at first.

The site is located in belarus (supposedly), their payment provider's website is in russian and provides local numbers for Moscow and Keiv, and their english help pages are full of engrish (ringlish? runglish?).
I would say at *best*, your support tickets are machine translated, worse case they're being handled by someone who only speaks english as a third or possibly fourth language.

Yep, that's it; it's long and convoluted but an incredibly eye-opening read. There's a PPT type summary w/ V/O here:

Mail/insurance fraud maybe? Could they be trying to make up for a bad initial yield on the ASICS?

Not sure how you inferred that from what I wrote. I pretty much expect  anyone running off-blockchain transactions is doing *something* to get an edge; legal, ethical, or otherwise. They're just not rubbing my face in it and telling me it's for my own good and to suck it up, because there are actually repercussions for their actions (or I guess repercussions to getting *caught* really).

Petition: To not care about what if any press coverage a project I have no involvement in whatsoever is called.

Wow, I somehow completely missed that Patrick Byrne's the same guy who wrote the deep capture analysis. Definitely ups my opinion of the guy

That includes all authority figures; like, just to name a random example, CEOs of financial companies.

Possible series of events:
1&gt; Someone MITM'd your connection to BTC-e and used your login attempt(s) to grab your credentials
2&gt; Thief tries to login with those credentials and sees 2FA is enabled
3&gt; Using the same MITM they pushed a fake pop-up telling you you needed to disable 2FA to continue (Why would BTC-e send such a pop-up? they can disable 2FA on their side with nothing required from you)
4&gt; You opened a support ticket and pasted the contents of the fake popup
5&gt; The machine translation for your requested morphed from "I got a weird pop asking me to disable 2FA on my account" to "Please disable 2FA on my account" (Possibly the exact phrasing was designed to be mistranslated this way by the various machine translators?)
6&gt; Thief uses password from step 2 and empties your account

You assume correctly. I thought that was a common abbreviation but based on a google search apparently not as common as I though.

Looks as though the people have spoken here. Time for a delicious fruit smoothie.

You know asset forfeiture has gone of the rails when they start using the same crazy arguments that sovereign citizens use
