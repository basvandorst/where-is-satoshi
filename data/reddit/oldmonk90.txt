You know how a post reaches front page on reddit and it's upvotes skyrocket, how a video hits trending on Youtube and  the views increase exponentially. I think bitcoin has not even reached the trending stage yet. Imagine when it does.

I am waiting since yesterday for the dip, so that I can put some money in. But it looks like this is the dip?

If you want to know about Jordan Peterson, reddit is the last place you should ask. They have a big hate boner for him for just giving self-help advice to young males. According to some of the comments here he is the satan himself. Damn, I hate reddit so much.

So only climate scientists are allowed to give opinions on this topic? So, all the John Oliver's and Colbert's should shut up about it right? You are only supposed to believe in climate change. Than your expertise does not matter, because you are only speaking the truth. But as soon as you doubt it, you should just stay in your lane.

EU is insignificant on the world stage anyways. I don't know why you even bother to comment, no one cares what EU thinks about anything.

I clicked on the first link, which goes to a webpage [rationalwiki.]( It has this to say about the guy: "He is to the debate what [Dr. Oz]( is to [medicine]( a rodeo clown who frames his information to give audiences what they want (a quick- fix [miracle cure]( and cries [censorship]( when confronted by actual [scientists]( I have never seen a wiki page so biased and derogatory towards another human. I don't even know this guy, but sorry if this is what your links are pointing towards, I am ignoring them.
And I am not going to debate you over climate change. I am not even defending Peterson over his views on climate change. I don't agree with him on this. You have a bad habit of putting words into my mouth and interpreting things I didn't even say. That's so disingenuous. There's no point debating with weasels like you.

What bubble do you live that you think many people think he is a dickhead? Because he is one of the top 10 bestseller author of this year. That's not an easy task if you believe he is this controversial, hated figure.

First of all I didn't use any pejoratives. It's the people in the comments using terms like psuedo-intellectual or far-right or nutjob, not me.
And why do you need a reason to dismiss someone based on any one issue? Is that what you look for in every person you follow? You will not find anyone worth listening to if you judge them based on one thing you disagree with or they said in the past. You could have just said "JP has doubts about climate change, and I disagree with him". But, no he is a merchant of doubt and climate change is the gospel of truth that no one should question. I find that really wierd. Almost like you don't want anyone to question your religion and faith because it's set in stone.

Ok, tell me how exactly I am not taking criticism well or projecting insecurity because I don't see it. If your criticism is he is alt-right or he is a psuedo-intellectual or whatever bs you like to spill, I am going to call you out on your bs. It's as simple as that.
