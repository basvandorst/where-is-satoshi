How do you differ to Crypto Pro / why should I switch? :)
Genuine question.  Your app looks nice but it's time for me to move my portfolio and set everything up. So it would be great to know your usp :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:20:03
By the way. It would be great to have portfolio total value alerts

Also explain you've moved it to a locked savings account or into gold or something not accessible.pre empting "you know all that money you now have... Wel...." From anyone. People go funny when they smell money. Especially family. Not all family of course. But even an inheritance or house left after death has split many siblings up

You mean "assumed busted". You're still making assumptions as far as I can tell. I didn't offer an opinion merely a comment but I appreciate you taking time to come back and further contribute to the discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:39:06
So I'm back. Hours later after watching the whole thing!!! :) I need more
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:41:57
How are they solving scale and speed? Does it impact security? I desperately want this to be an everyday currency
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:19:25
Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to feedback. I'll check it out. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:12:38
Also why would you bet bitcoin will hit20000. Put that same bet amount into bitcoin and you will make much more than the payout from the bookmaker :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:24:48
Nope.

Do you have any struggling families nearby? How much would it cost me to feed them for a week? More? If I pay you by bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:11:09
Bots and shills / spammers for bcash have been posting that they are out of bitcoin to try and get others to do the same. So we are drowning out their noise with fun. 
Bitcoin comments are as resilient as bitcoin (core) it seems :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:45:24
But also. I feel like maybe there is an awareness campaign you can run there? Sponsor a farmer? I'd much rather pay 80 bucks for what you describe vs 2 bucks a month to a charity where I have zero idea where my money actually goes.

Better idea = imagine the monthly loan payment you would make each month. Put that amount (roughly) into bitcoin each month. If it crashes you owe no one anything. If it doesn't you get interest back and still owe no one anything (maybe tax man though). 
Don't get the loan due to fomo. Even a bit each week / month very quickly adds up.

Have you looked at SMART given it offers what is essentially interest / dividends for holding among its approach for supporting real world proposals 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:01:00
Don't think so. It's called SmartCash. The bring a chunk of the block reward into a pool where people can then submit proposals and then holders can vote. If the vote passes they get funds. Could be to build new tech or run food drives. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:39:36
I just grabbed SMART (SmartCash) a few weeks back. If you're looking for suggestions.

The crypto pro app offers an awesome complication including a multi crypto one for the larger areas. I'd take a picture of mine but it's 3am and the missus is asleep next to me while I can't sleep because of crypto excitement. :)

Going to guess pay day at work
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:46:52
Is it actually  that they are showing? Or are they using their data source but doing something extra?
I mean, it is AWESOME that this has shown up in Yahoo Finance at all. :) Just curious.

I've no idea how to safely get and dump my BCH. :) Hey ho.

@_date: 2017-11-28 09:12:06
In your eyes... probably. But I won't let a 6 day old reddit account bother me :) HAVE A GREAT DAY
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:36:39
What features are you adding that others don't? I currently use Crypto Pro which has watch complication etc and let's me store my portfolio etc. How will yours be different? I'm always looking to get better apps if they come along :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:43
I type on a tiny keyboard at 3am. It's going to happen
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:19:38
Just put another £100 in as it's pay day. If there is a dip I will grab more. If there isn't I will grab more.

Have you looked at SmartCash? Seems to be getting traction out in your country. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:31:14
Just zoom the chart out.

Likewise. I invest in five only. Always do your due diligence. :) I have found the people around this one exceptionally transparent and available
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:46:16
Crypto pro has a good one but I'd like more options

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:46:32
Likewise. It's a really interesting subject. I'd suggest getting into coins that's you're interested in and think stand for something and have something unique rather than just focusing on the potential gains. It's why I like SMART. 
I hope you have success whatever you'd decide to do and I hope you have a chance to pay it forward to others in the future too. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:43:55
For sure. I just like to pay it forward and I have something to pay forward. I don't have the facilities to teach but I can maybe bring a family breathing room, some time to relax, a little faith in humanity. I don't disagree with your statement I just think there is room for all approaches :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:35:50
Sorry then :) just reads as an insult calling someone dim

Yuuusssss I can buy some cake. Great idea!!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:42:11
I don't discuss my investment / gambles. But I try to keep them spread reasonably evenly over a few places. Not all in one place. I'm not a financial advisor. 
I'd suggest reading their site and maybe jumping in to their slack channel. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:11:15
It's not live yet and I don't want it tied to my reddit id :) but may pop back in the future ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:22:46
Just buy before the dip. During the dip and after the dip. Whenever you buy all three are true. Buying bitcoin is quantum. :)
@_date: 2017-04-17 07:21:53
Useful comment. Thanks for chiming in. ����
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:20:44
Would it make you choose one store over another or is it very much "bean first" given the other part of your comment? :)
Also. I presume you only buy beans and not Pre ground? :)
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:26:50
Noted. We're doing a bunch of flavoured coffees that have tested VERY well but that requires a 24 hour process that happens after grinding. We are launching regular coffees with wonderful single origin beans though so we can cater for everyone. We will be putting samples of the flavoured lines into deliveries of beans to see if we can tempt people just like you into trying something off the beaten path :)
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:54:21
Oddly this is my thinking too. But then I figure spending a little helps with growth and adoption. :)
Right now bitcoin feels more like gold than currency for sure. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:27:55
True. Though for reference I'm talking about online in this instance :) I believe that to still be true though. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:10:16
How is it different to any regular top up card like Starbucks uses? 
Cash can be used anywhere without having to get retailers on board so how would you get retailers on board to make the pay service useful to customers and retailers?
Not picking holes. Genuinely curious to hear more :)
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:42:33
I'll be honest. I don't entirely "get" what the benefit is still. Right now someone can come to me with cash, card, apple pay, gift voucher or loyalty points / top up card and buy my coffee. I pay a tiny fee which is factored into my margins. 
I dont see what you're offering that is better for me or the customer that doesn't also introduce new steps to make a purchase (create another account, top it up, get a code/address) etc etc. 
I'm not trying to be a dick :) maybe talk through some scenarios from a customer perspective and a seller perspective? First time purchase / sale and repeat purchase / sale. 
It "feels" like the benefits are technological for sure but I don't yet figure the benefits for the users :) especially as I'm not sure fraud etc is really a problem and using CVV checks online etc it's mostly non existent for this market 
@_date: 2018-11-04 20:05:37
Not a great start. Not running the whole thing on SSL.

@_date: 2017-09-22 15:10:43
Right now, if bitcoin failed/lost its money over night (and assuming they had been having their salary paid into there and was using it as a bank account of sorts) then the government would not protect against that value loss. Instead he just has no money. 
If that had been in an actual bank it would have been protected and they would still have their money (e.g. recent financial collapses in UK, USA etc). Sure, it's still a shit show... but they haven't ended up with a bunch of worthless pounds or dollars either.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:36:58
It’s ok :) not shooting you down. It may have been a new implementation :) 
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:48:21
I mean, you're right, it does take 0.1 of a second to scroll past and ignore this gif/post. But I suppose it is longer for you because you go into the post, read the comments, get annoyed, post an annoyed comment. I can see how that could get in the way of your reddit browsing. I'm sorry you got annoyed, I hope you're feeling better now and are enjoying the price going up more than how much this gif has annoyed you :)
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:54:37
Makes sense that they would have shadow accounts considering they run shadow support with shadow tickets ;)

What's an easy BCH wallet that I can get access to my BCH that was created at fork? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:36:50
Just got in to SmartCash yesterday because of this
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:53:20
This has been available for many months no? I set up the choose coinbase option in February
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:26:52
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:11:49
I think really the point is that bitcoin can't / won't replace fiat but will exist with it. But for most people I talk about they try to consider it a currency in the tradition sense and as if it's ALL or NOTHING. I don't currently see a near to mid term future where bitcoin /crypto will 'replace' anything - only exist with. But that's ok right?
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:36:25
sorry, I was just making a joke about their support ;) - but your point is likely valid / the most correct one.
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:15:40

What wallet can I use on iPhone or Mac to get my BCH following the fork? Just want to turn it to BTC or SMART
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:18:50
Did they? I read that post as I have my own choice on which I use with their app. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:17:11
Not sure that helps the OP. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:28:49
Yup yup. Get it out to a wallet you own. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:22:58
My money (albeit not much) is in coinbase. Should I be worried? I thought they were the only reputable hosted approach?! :(
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:14:52
I'm tempted. Any solid reasons? Or just a feeling?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:16:21
Thank you for the update. Not like I can find out from coinbase for the fifth day in a row :)  
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:17:22
Turn on airplane. Then turn on WiFi. I use it to block calls but use internet :)
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:39:49
Calm down. I'm aware of the risks. :) For small amounts and fluidity / purchasing on the move etc I've been using coinbase but I'm just wondering if they are as solid as they make out. 
For I'm keeping hundreds not thousands in there. 
And to be pedantic. I wasn't asking the question you've answered. But thank you for taking the time to comment :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:22:13
How about Bitcoin Confidential ? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:22:48
It is getting beyond coincidence how much their site and services going down is directly linked to when the price goes down.
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:47:29
Not really an excuse these days. Scaling servers are the norm. Their API scales fine too. It actually is easy to enable scale on demand now. And they have a buttload of funding to implement it. 
Don't get me wrong. Coding is hard. As are transactional functions etc with proper rollback and financial institution connections etc. 
But this is not because it's hard to scale to demand. That's within reach of anyone these days and is a lesson properly identified back when Twitter had issues (though partly due to ruby)
I could be wrong of course. And I'm not looking to pick a fight :) I think I'm just getting at coinbase having problems yet again!!
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:10:48
Then hope they don't have an accident or get tortured for the info by the mob :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:49:28
Currently not quite to 1btc so sounds suitable for now. Mainly just want to get it off of coinbase. :)
And if I lose my phone I can still recover it with phrases? :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:43:05
I'd buy. But coinbase is running it's usual suspicious timing
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:05:31
Sorry. I meant share ideas in an abstract sense I guess :) 
I'm keen for them to be available if I die to others. And also if my house gets blown up/fire etc I don't lose the recovery phrase. 
So I guess I need to have it hidden in something in two locations. Then instructions with a solicitor or something 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:34:38
Thanks. As it happens I just ordered a book to write this in that a thief wouldn't look at but I won't forget is the book with what I need in :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:51:59
Thank you. That's useful. I'm not there yet so I think this is a suitable solution for now :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:33:58
Thanks. All sorted. Just sent a test £10 to the wallet to check all working. Suspect it may take a while to show up 
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:06:22
Hah. I realised after I posted. I meant abstract (eg at home, at work, in a safe, using codes etc) but even that can be a give away. :) I don't expect many replies
