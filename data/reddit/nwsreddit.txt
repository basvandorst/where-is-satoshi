What did you learn?

Your asking for dollar figures in a personal finance question, it's often going to be a touchy subject.

There are some great comments down there-

Most sections of CA are completely different from each other.  Fort Bragg is nothing like Oakland but they are both considered northern California.

"car chase"  aka "following a car"

You could also be tortured for your bank info...

"Lemme grab my free lunch before I ruin my chances of getting a free lunch."
is what I'm hearing. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:57:12
He engaged in a car chase for a free lunch?  This is shitty reporting and only serves to confuse.

It could matter somehow, let's not play dumb.  We can know who he is without posting a picture of his house.

This is a strange site.

Update looks great, I like the idea here.

The low resolution background image looks really unprofessional.  Just a thought.

Even if it was reported exactly as it happened I don't understand how somebody saying "yes I did that" is proof of anything. People claim things that aren't true all the time.  What am I missing. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:44:40
..I like the small trains.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:27:43
What the shit dude, you're fantasizing torture in a very creepy and detailed manor. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:28:10


Hopefully they will adapt and be prepared, or they will be gone too.  That's how this needs to work.  The best companies prosper, not the most sentimental.

Semi-anonymous, It's still tied to your reddit profile.  People could make throwaways but I'm sure it's just a gut reaction to a personal question.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:34:28
This post is either stupid or inflammatory.  Take your pick.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:37:58
I'm seeing all the proof I need, are you available for immediate interview? I want to try and save a shitty dying newspaper.

An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
Probably one of those quotes that goes undigested.  There's no fucking point to exposing her.  It hurts us all and your petty desire for revenge is not worth it.  
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:43:26
More like rekindled a lost interest.  N-Scale or bust.

I'm going to downvote you for contributing nothing worthwhile to the conversation.

I was making fun of her sentence syntax.  The way it's phrased has him engaging in a weird car chase for a free lunch. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:22:07
It's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than open your mouth and remove all doubt.

They will send a check on your behalf.  They are extra good at this because you can have it save up the money over time and get to the exact right amount on the day it needs to be sent to get there on time.

Before downvoting this guy for posting a personalized link it should be noted that there are no referral benefits.  The company is just trying to pace membership.
