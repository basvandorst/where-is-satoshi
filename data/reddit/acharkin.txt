The date on the article is April 14, 2016. That's today. I am bemused by your cynicism and skepticism. 
"Considering that CTI has only been around since 2015, it has managed to receive funding and donations through individuals and corporate donors who believe in its mission to help the women in Afghanistan." I am sure that you will see apps and other work produced by women in Afghanistan in the near future. You may not know that it was even by them, if they are doing work for a larger company overseas, but that doesn't diminish their real capacity or potential.

"By offering courses in coding, access to technology and professional resources in addition to job placement, CTI students have a greater chance of attaining employment that is both financially rewarding and socially accessible." THIS is what the women are doing. They are learning valuable skills that qualify them for good jobs, many of which can be conducted from home, which is crucial. Bitcoin then enables these women to get paid for doing these technically skilled jobs.
The article is perfectly clear. Thanks to the author and Bitcoin Magazine for featuring Code to Inspire. It's a great organization. (And no, I'm not affiliated with CTI.)

These are cool! You should add it to the comments section at the bottom of the article.

I've been using mine for a while and I really like it. I get paid exclusively in bitcoin and it's nice to have the option of transferring funds to my card right away so I can go shopping. But I still tend to go through an exchange and then transfer funds to my bank account to pay regular bills.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:14:08
Interesting point. A follow-up piece that looks at these options might be a good idea. I wonder if there a way for bitcoin neophytes to get started easily with document validation.
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:58:12
This is the BitPlastic rate - and it does seem high. Though I've seen some bitcoin ATMs charge close to that.
I asked E-coin about a conversion fees and was told there wasn't one. However they said their exchange rate might not be quite as favourable as what you might get on a regular exchange.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:05:59
I get paid in BTC so I put my spending money (groceries etc) and some bill payment amounts (cell phone for example) on my E-coin card. That takes only minutes to move. Basically anything I can pay with a Visa debit card. Then I exchange the rest into dollars so I can pay my mortgage etc. which usually takes anywhere from a few hours to a day or two. I love getting paid in BTC since my clients are all around the world. Sure beats waiting 5 business days to get my money out of PayPal.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:16:46
Good idea - I hadn't thought of that lol - here's mine, if you like.

Hasn't SSL been replaced by TLS?
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:16:26
It seems to work fine - I paid a couple of bills as an experiment but the fees are too high for me to do this on a regular basis. I pay around $15/month for unlimited bank transactions, but on Bylls it cost me $12 to pay just two of my regular monthly bills.  
On the upside, since I get paid in BTC, it was convenient to be able to bypass the whole exchange process and pay directly from my wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:22:11
Whoa. That is a serious publishing endorsement. Kudos!
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:10:05
Fantastic. I wonder if it is the same for Western Union.

I just blogged about this earlier in the week. People are using bitcoin for remittances all over the world:

Great discussion. I hope they post the video later since I couldn't stay for the whole thing.

Definitely. This seems to be a constructive way of addressing an important issue. I hope that people will find their way to the workshops in spite of the (peripheral) drama that seems to be sucking up all the attention.

Yay, BitGive! Thanks, couchdive!

Really? I've had no problem buying bitcoin in Canada whatsoever. We have several excellent exchanges (I use QuadrigaCX), as well as bitcoin ATMs in several major cities. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:39:33
Yup! Set up with BTCPay. And there's a $6 discount if you pay with BTC. [

I wonder if they use blockchain.info for their API. My Kryptokit wallet has been down for 2 days now too and I was told it was an API issue.

Whereabouts? Which neighbourhood? I'd think that some locations would be more successful than others.

I've been using Bit-X for a few months now in Canada. Mostly it's been good. I'm looking forward to getting my new named card. Unfortunately, though, when I went across the border into the US last month, none of the ATMs or POS machines would accept my card, which was a real problem. Maybe because it was New York?

I gave each of my kids a brainwallet with BTC in it in their stockings for Christmas. I used personalized Christmas greetings to generate each brainwallet. Fun :)
One of them wanted to test them out, the other bought Xbox games.
