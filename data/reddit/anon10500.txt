@_date: 2017-12-20 22:54:34
Nothing is bad. Bitcoin core is scared because their investors are losing money while bitcoin cash becomes more relevant.

Bullshit, all lies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:08
Your ignorance/stupidity does not change how the market works.

@_date: 2017-11-28 11:28:37
It is not funny, it is serious... You already know soft forks does not create another chain however you still need a segwit client. 
Actually I should have said; bitcoin core is not bitcoin once on-chain transaction is clogged to death.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:56
PR firms hired by Blockstream &amp; AXA
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:30:05


Until you can't
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:12:05
It is not my opinion, segwit separated settlement layer from transaction layer... Obviously you low IQ idiots will only understand price memes. oh whatever...
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:02:20
oh fuck off with russian card you cnn idiot
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:15:37

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:32:17
Problem is bitcoin core is not bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:46:41
gotta be very careful nowadays, r/bitcoin may spam themselves to make up a case
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:52

@_date: 2017-07-25 09:14:58
Selling BTC and buying BCC.
SewFags HODL while BTC collapses.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:10:57
How much do you get shilling online? Anyways, once BTC turns in to dumpcoin you and like will be irrelevant.
