Why is Bitcoin gaining so much value in the past few days: 
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:12:39
ATM is more like gold. Once they fix the transaction fees so you can buy a coffee with it with out paying 100% fee over it it's gonna get a step closer :) Right now I do not use it for payments, I prefer Ethereum for that, from practical perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:18:44
What will happen with all the B2X people bought on HitBTC?

The chain gets copied. Meaning all your coins are duplicated. In order to access those coins you need to have access to your wallet private key or/if you have coins on exchange that exchange needs to support Bitcoin Silver and give access to the coins (not all exchanges do that).
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:17:27
Bitcoin Cash can't handle the pressure. Going sub $1000 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:44:21
Do you think this is the top or it can go even higher? The last $ATH was at very similar price in August (
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:11:10

@_date: 2017-11-08 16:51:07
HODL4LIFE :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:07:09
This could easly push Bitcoin over $10k by the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:00:23
This could drive Bitcoin price over $10k 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:59:27
Congratz :) Seems like a good time to cash out, Bitcoin keeps dropping 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:15:37

Hoping for $10.000 before New Year!! Now its $7000+ 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:06:42
Its almost $250 already. Once Bitcoin gets to $10k its gonna be $300 B. Check total market cap on top of  page.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:22:25
I bought at $340 :) too bad I didn't HODL all the way hehe, but there's still loads of money to be made, BTC should soon reach $10.000, prolly by the end of the year 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:15:15
Bitcoin might reach $10k end this year  BCH will be the past if this happens.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:04:25
There's plenty of names left, Platinum, Titanium, Steel :D or even Emerald or Ruby!
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:58:08
Bitcoin might go over $10k by the end of the year because of Bitcoin futures: 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:09:59

@_date: 2017-11-18 21:11:39
It’s ready for $8000 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:57:47
I'm sure in the future banks will adopt so you can have banks do the safekeeping of cryptocurrencies for you, kinda defeats the purpuse of crypto but yeah, one step at a time. People need to feel safe, especially ones that are not that familiar with crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:50:34
Bitcoin is gonna go for correction now, prolly down to $6000 or $5500, then soon over $8000 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:11:38
It got canceled, pretraded price dropped like crazy 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:04:19
