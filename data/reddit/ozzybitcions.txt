Having alternate implementations that maintain byte for byte consensus with each other in all circumstances is very difficult, especially as the Bitcoin blockchain has a number of quirky transactions in it that might require special treatment.
There have been attempts at doing this for Bitcoin such as BitcoinD but people see too much risk in being on the wrong the side of a blockchain split.
Instead, what has emerged is one implementation with hopefully a lot of eyeballs on it. 
But you know.. it's good we have other blockchains trying things differently.

This is the first time I've seen this site and regardless of the support of bitcoin this site disappoints and slightly disgusts me.
It's a free world and a free market and people can do what they want, but that doesn't mean that the majority of people using this site aren't shooting themselves in the foot.
I checked out some of the questions and answers and as I suspected this is mostly not a tutoring page, it's a page where you pay someone to do your homework for you.
Let me say that if you're having problems doing your homework the first thing you should try doing is talking to a classmate. If you can't talk to any of your classmates for whatever reason then talk to the teacher who set the assignment. They aren't getting paid to set assignments, they're getting paid to teach people stuff and make you a more empowered person!
You can't go forwards in life by paying someone else to do anything you find tricky. Even if you are rich enough to do that then chances are this will lead to an unfulfilling life.

I sent $5 to a family friend in a village in Tanzania just a few days ago as a test. We have sent money to him for years via traditional means to help run a village that has the regions hospital.

Sure. If I used Western Union to send $5 AUD from Australia to a mobile phone in Tanzania it would cost me an additional $5. A 100% fee.
If I was to send $100 AUD it would cost me $10. That's a 10% fee. 
Plus the exchange rate they use is heavily loaded. Google tells me $100 AUD is 160,000 TZS, Western Union tells me it's ~153,000 TZS.
BitPesa is a flat 3% fee plus a much smaller exchange rate spread, even when sending $5, and I don't need to give anyone my credit card details.
Bitpesa can take an hour or two to process, Western Union claims "within minutes" with a few caveats.

Also, if it kicks off a little bit it would be cool to hold, say, 10% that will only be donated when the game is finished, and that you show that tally on the twitch stream as something to aim to.

Similar to OP I heard about CoinSpace from a friend about 3 weeks ago. It does seem that Australia is a CoinSpace hotspot.
I encourage everyone reading to try to get invited to a CoinSpace meeting and to bring a wingman if possible, even if they don't know about crypto. The truth is that there are very few people in the world with enough knowledge to be able to see and reveal this as the scam that it is.
When I arrived I noticed that I was the youngest person in the room by about 15 years. I'm sure this wasn't an accident and I wasn't supposed to be there because I know too much.
My most hated parts of this story are:
- The token 'S-Coin' is currently in pre-sale. There's no white paper, code or set coin limit.
- I got told that they are "hiring the people behind Bitcoin" to create their currency.
- The mining equipment being hired with the money people put in probably actually exists to some degree and is mining whichever alt-coin is the most profitable to mine using GPUs. But the money earned by mining is not given back to the person directly, instead they get near worthless S-Coin.
- They are encouraging people to put in money from their superannuation (i.e. their retirement money). Mega-grrrrr on this one.
Fellow bitcoiners, you have the knowledge to be able to prevent tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars from being lost to this scam if you ever get the opportunity.

Aussie aussie aussie!  oi oi oi!
Yes it's true that Australia hasn't started treating bitcoin as a currency YET, but all signs point to it happening well before the US. 
The key point in the Senate hearings was when they reviewed their current definition of 'foreign currency', which is defined as 'any currency that's not the Australian currency'. The tax office interpreted that as meaning that foreign currencies are the currencies of other countries, and what with bitcoin not having a country and all then it didn't fall under the definition. 
That now looks at set to change, based on the preliminary findings of the Senate committee. 
Now the question is, will Coinjar move back to Australia once bitcoin is considered a currency there, or is it going to be too hard for them?

@ non-speculative, government backed, capital inflow
Some people NEED Bitcoin, as opposed to just wanting to buy some in the hope of selling it for more one day. These people are in that situation because of government laws. That is, if the laws went away the need to use Bitcoin would diminish. If you are still confused then think about the sort of people that would prefer to use cash over bank transfer.
@_date: 2016-02-22 11:32:42
Which industry? :-)
It's worth noting what the difference is:
Remember that one of the properties of Bitcoin is that the people securing the network are rewarded with bitcoins. So long as they have 'decent' value the network should be kept secure.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Blockchains that aren't supported by a crypto-currency reward need to be structured in a different way and this restructure removes some of Bitcoins benefits such as a lack of central control.
Blockchain tech will be tested by banks as a new way of settling credits and debts between each other, however these Blockchains are likely to only be sitting on bank servers and they will have to work out a way of making sure they are all playing by the same rules, otherwise one bank could maliciously try to record that a debt on their Blockchain was settled when in fact it wasn't. This is one of the challenges that groups like R3 will have to solve... how do they make sure that everyone is following the protocol for that Blockchain?
In the near future there are going to be plenty of Blockchain related jobs being advertised by banks. Not just programming but legal as well (and probably others). Banks are adopting Blockchain tech as a way of saving costs but also as a way of combating Bitcoin which is a long term threat.
There'll be a lot of focus and money in Blockchain in the near future for sure, and yes it will probably be more than Bitcoin for now.

You must have changed 'industry' to 'world' whilst I was replying, sorry about that.
Even with 6 billion people not having access to banking, the voices of those people and those countries are not very loud compared to those where the worlds largest banks reside. Plus they will spend a lot of money on Blockchain and on controlling the message. I would love to be wrong though.

It's reasonable to compare PayPal to Bitcoin because they're both digital forms of payment, but PayPal is just a database with numbers in it that banks and merchants are prepared to transact with. That is, PayPal money is a layer on top of the 'real' money which allows them to do funky things like reversals and escrow.
I like to compare Bitcoin to a $50 note or a gold coin. When I give it to somebody else that transaction can't be undone (the closest you can get to undoing it is for them to give it back to you but that's a subtle difference and not my main point).  
Escrow and reversals are things that are built on a layer on top of Bitcoin. But those entities need a solid base to build on top of so that when they receive a Bitcoin transaction that's important to the function of their business they know that it can't be reversed. (orphan blocks notwithstanding) 
It could well be that within 3 to 5 years nearly no individuals transact in the base Bitcoin blockchain and that space is instead used by companies and lightening network hubs to settle. In that world there will be a PayPal-like company for Bitcoin that may or may not be PayPal itself.

I'd rather have my credit card stolen than my Bitcoin private key...
Actually, from the customers side credit cards are better in almost all ways.  Credit card transactions can be reversed if the details are stolen. You also don't have to carry all the actual currency with you, as credit cards are just a promise to pay in the future, not the actual value itself. Most credit cards come with insurance in case what you buy is discovered to be broken at time of purchase.
Your comparison might work better if you use cash rather than credit cards, but of course, cash it not digital, not borderless etc.

Credit card transactions might look to you like they take a few seconds but there's actually no value being transferred at that point.  All that happens in those few seconds is that the credit card company says that the card is valid and promises to pay the merchant in the future. The merchant doesn't actually see the money for a week or more later and in the mean time you can reverse the transaction if it's fraudulent. When you look at it that way, 45 minutes is a much faster time to verify a payment.
When you pay someone in Bitcoin it's not like using a credit card (which is a chain of debt) it's more like handing over cash.
Yes, 10 minutes is the average block confirmation time, but there IS a method that can be used to verify the transaction with a generally acceptable level of confidence called Simplified Payment Verification or SPV. In this case the transaction propagation over the network is monitored until the payment processor can say "yeah, that's probably going to go through OK". At which point the payment is approved.
Many merchants and some smartphone wallets use this technique and it helps give people the immediate feeling like the one you seem to desire.
It seems like the interactions that you've had are with merchants not using SPV (exchanges perhaps?) and so the standard Bitcoin block confirmation time applies. 
Edit: I was wrong to call it SPV, that's something different that you don't have to worry about.

Best of luck Abby.
If you're looking for a prominent Bitcoiner nearby to practice your art on then might I suggest Chris Ellis of World Crypto Network on YouTube and the ProTip tipping app currently on IndieGoGo. He's looking for artists to promote as part of the ProTip launch so you might be able to benefit each other.

Sellers have options available to them like postage tracking and taking photographs. If this costs you more then you can offload that cost back onto the purchaser by increasing the postage fee.

If you have a link to documentation of a PoW algorithm that's  botnet resistant I'd love to have a read because that's what it's going to have to be right?
Didn't Bitcoin benefit in the early days by generally not attracting as many bad actors as good ones until the hashing power grew to a level that put hash power related attacks out of the reach of most?
Put another way, how can a new PoW algorithm select or prefer good actors over bad ones?
I'm not the expert here, sorry if I'm sounding like one.

Ok. I'm sorry I'm on my lunch break and have run out of time. Got a smartphone? Download a wallet app. iOS= Breadwallet, Android = Bitcoin Wallet.
 Then in coinbase send coins to the address that your wallet shows.  Try sending a little first to make sure it works.  You will probably have to type in a long string of text and numbers that starts with a 1 in order to do that.
Then in your wallet app there's a way of creating a backup file.
Don't panic too heavily, coinbase seems pretty solid. You have time to learn things properly and the most likely scenario is that coinbase is still around in a year and your coins will still be there for you to pick up.

We didn't know it was the Willy bot during the 2013/2014 rise, so just because you can't see any driving factor right now doesn't mean there isn't one.
This run up is obviously still mostly people who only want to sell their Bitcoin for more fiat one day. Spectators.
There probably is an increase in non-speculative use too, which you can try to get a feeling for via localbitcoins volume, but that can't account for what's happened to the price in the past week imo.

Thanks mate, got mine out too.
Heads up to others, transferring to your CoinJar Swipe card appears to be one way. I tried to turn cash on the card back into btc via the Android app and didn't seem to be able to. Also, if you try to take your swipe money out of an ATM then I seem to remember there's a fee, maybe someone can confirm. But no fee for using as a debit card at a shop.
If any of this is wrong I'm happy to be corrected.

I wonder if this was once true for email as well.
Of course, now the majority of emails are not sent by people but by computers and that's the other point here I think, thinking about this in terms of number of people on the planet is missing one of the advantages of Bitcoin, that it can be owned, sent and received by computers.

Exchanges are not banks. You only own the Bitcoin if you (or a device you control) own the private keys.
Exchanges have been known to disappear, taking your Bitcoins with them. Send them to a wallet you have control over, make a back-up an rest easy knowing that nobody can steal your coins.

Fair question. There's multiple definitions of "they" and multiple definitions of "power".

Don't let his Australian accent fool you, he definitely says "Monkey-er" at about 0:17. He also blinks a lot and looks away whilst saying "Yes" to being Satoshi, which is a tell in body language.
I'm not believing this until we see the proof on the blockchain and even if we do I believe him to be a small player in the "Satoshi Nakamoto" group of people.
@_date: 2015-10-19 06:44:51
Good news.
The only good argument that the banks have is that they're concerned that these companies don't comply with KYC/AML.
Places like CoinJar already do pretty solid KYC, so money laundering is probably going to be where the rubber hits the road in this investigation.
But requiring the Bitcion companies to prove that their clients don't launder money is like asking a bank to prove that cash taken out of their ATM isn't laundered or used to buy drugs. The AML burden stops somewhere, the question is are the banks treating Bitcoin differently to cash?
Also, regardless of all of this, the banks dropped the ball by closing the accounts all on the same day. This reeks of collusion and they should be put over the coals for it. Fortunately, the Australian government has more teeth for punishing banks than the US appears to.

The video is indeed mostly about the Ethereum fork but with a bit of discussion about how this is informative for the bitcoin community.
Chris is not favoring either fork and praises Vitalik Buterin for trying to maintain neutrality, but he is down on people who say that Ethereum Classic should not exist and that the exchanges should not be trading it. He gives good reasons for this.
Many YouTube videos on Crypto are ill-prepared rants by people with a shallow understanding. This video is a rare exception to that. Chris has done his research and backs up everything he is saying with the proof.
The video is also impressive because he can only function at this level after taking strong pain killers due to an ongoing illness. (I wouldn't normally mention this except he admits to it in the video and he has been away from broadcasting for a while).

If there was a bank that didn't do fractional reserve it wouldn't be able to provide services or rates that were as good for their customers as their competitors.
The fact that banks fractionally reserve shows that this is the most efficient way to run a bank as a business. If you're not comfortable with the market solution you should lobby for a government owned bank or stricter bank regulation.

This is because of the GST treatment? Well there's already ways of buying BTC legally in Australia without paying GST, don't know about Ethereum.
You're speculating that there's a queue of people who desperately want to buy but can't handle paying GST. I don't think that's the case, if you need to use Bitcoin then you're already using Bitcoin.
If there's going to be an uptick it's just going to be because people are speculating about what's going to happen on July 1st. If that's the case then the uptick will be before then.

If you raise the blocksize to 2x or even 10x you'll eventually run into the same problem we have today. Probably in a year or two.
It also means that it's more expensive to run a full node, so Bitcoin will become more centralised.
If this is your long term scaling solution then eventually we'll only have a few full nodes in the world, Bitcoin will no longer be decentralised and we might as well use Visa or Swift.
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:12:10
Blockstream doesn't control Bitcoin, miners do (plus the market that makes bitcoin valuable). This is how Bitcoin was designed.
SegWit is a capacity increase by the way. SegWit will lower fees.
