I was under the assumption that wallets were for cold storage and the BTC I plan on spending in small increments could easily be done through the coinbase app. Still not seeing an advantage to a hardware wallet that costs money compared to free paper wallets. Let’s say I wanted to buy a bike from a neighbor, could I send him btc from my hardware with no fee?

A more mature approach would be to count your blessings and accept that hindsight will always be 20-20. I understand your predicament but exponential growth doesn’t have to mean exponential regret. Volunteer to serve an unfortunate community for an afternoon and get out of your own head. I truly don’t mean to offend but the school of thought you’ve outlined above is greed.

Well mass adoption of open homosexuality and unescorted women has been getting on well so far. The honest answer to your question, and I’m not trying to be a dick here, is that BTC and the world don’t need SA to move forward.

@_date: 2014-02-25 16:21:17
The issue they have yet to own is that they have been dicking people around who were trying to verify their accts and leave gox for good since November (like me). Which means they knew there was in an issue in November. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:31:43
My questions surround taxation. I believe that if convert BTC into USD on a platform and later use it to buy BTC again or some other crypto, even if I never withdrew the USD to a checking account, it is considered a taxable event, correct? 
Well I’ve done that a great many times in the past five years and never claimed anything crypto related. 
There was also the fork where I all of a sudden had bcash, sold that bought BTC,taxable? probably.
How liable am I? I’ve only ever invested cash and made trades, once I moved 2000 usd to my checking just to prove to myself that withdrawals were possible, then put it back. Should I still be including my crypto holdings on taxes even if I’ve never physically taken profit?

You’re not. The price of BTC is down slightly from the price 24 hrs before the screenshot was taken. Go to the accounts tab to see the value of your holdings.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:56:20
You could. You could put your public key qr code on a poster and hang it in the shop with no risk. Although only those with the private key (you) can move the coin, anyone with the pubic key can check the wallet’s balance. For that reason, I would set up a wallet for customers to deposit into, then move the BTC daily into my hardware from the wallet address I advertise publicly.

As someone following closely since 4/14 and who lost a few hundred bucks in the MtGox debacle, then later reinvested with better safeguards and is hodling strong, I agree and say heed these words. The horror stories of heads who lost their life savings trying to get rick quick and who planned to fly to Japan to get their own answers from Gox were really sad. The desperation was evident through their words and I wish that pain and anxiety on nobody within or outside this community. Be safe, let’s ride for years.
