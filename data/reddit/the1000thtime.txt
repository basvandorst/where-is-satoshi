Crypto-trade.com also accepts OKPay. As far as I know it's also the only exchange you can buy shares in but I might be wrong about that.

I love some of the designs but am put off ordering by uncertainty about shipping cost to the UK, and I don't want to go all the way through checkout to find out.  You might want to include an indicative ball-park figure for a single shirt and for the 10 x shirt for $50 options to UK / Europe / Aus/NZ, etc.

So if I use this tool offline, test out the addresses thus generated with a watching only wallet and a small amount of BTC, then move more coins into when I am confident that it works... why do I actually need a hardware wallet? What advantage does having the device have over just keeping the seed safe? Doesn't it just introduce another risk (that of losing the device)?
Sorry if this is a noob question, I think I'm just missing something.

Your wallet, hardware or software is just a collection of private keys to different public addresses. Unless you have sent coins from one of these addresses to another, people looking at the completely public blockchain cannot connect these addresses with each other as they are not connected in any way until a transaction has occurred between them. 
If you want to see how connected any two addresses you control are, just look at the "taint" of the address on blockchain.info

Is there any way of using Diceware (using real dice) to generate the SEED of a HD wallet? I know it's possible for a particular individual address but I am interested in something akin to the 12 word Mycelium passphrase, only where I generate it myself from a (defined and persistent - i.e. retrievable many years into the future) word list.
As far as I can work out, the issue with doing this is something to do with not being able to generate an appropriate checksum from 12 random words but beyond that it goes over my head.
My motivation would be that (and please do correct me if I'm wrong) ANY computer based random number generator is (at least theoretically) capable of attack (including in theory the seeds in hardware wallets).
What would be the issues with such an approach, even if it were possible? Any help welcome. Thank you.

mBTC = milliBitcoin = "Mitcoin"
uBTC = microBitcoin = "Mutcoin"
Just a suggestion.

One relevant comparison seems to be bitcoin with the ghost monies mentioned in the text. Not because of its virtual nature, but because the ghost monies could not be altered in value by filing etc. Similaly bitcoin cannot be surreptitiously altered as all the mathematical factors which define its value are open to everyone to know.
Perhaps for this reason bitcoin might become the default unit of account against which lesser 'coins' (e.g. dollars) are compared. Interesting article.

Does anyone have an opinion on whether Bitfunder or Havelock is better? I will have to set up a new account on one of them to accept a transfer so would welcome any thoughts on which.

You can invest in another exchange. Cryptotrade is HK based and you can trade its shares directly on the website.

Apologies if you are outside the UK - you probably won't be able to listen to BBC's iPlayer. Overall, a positive piece about bitcoin on a major national network.

Firstly, congratulations on the launch. Looks really good and I agree that an SMS option can only help bitcoin adoption. 
I agree with the points dbfish makes. I would be really brief in explaining. In fact, given the broad audience base you are hoping to appeal to I would put all technical explanations on a less visible page (if people really want to know about the exact nature of spoofing for example) and only include How to s here (i.e. instructions not explanations), with screen shots under clear headings. How to check your balance, How to send bitcoins to a phone, etc.
Good luck!
