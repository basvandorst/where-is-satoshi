Really? Because I lived through one crash from 260 down to 50, then 1200 down to around 280. So it's fallen 75 percent a couple of times since 2013. That would take us to 5k this time... Though it could also fall to the previous bubbles ath of $1200 if it follows the same pattern
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:10:09
It absolutely is... down to the "return to normal" and subsequent dive which will continue. 
Its a classic speculative bubble, you're still in the delusion phase if you see it any other way. 
Just go to bitcoinwisdom and zoom out on the 1day. 
You're blind if you cant see it. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:27:10
I'm with you on the bubble Tim. I think you're off on your sub $1000 projection though. I don't know how long you have been in Bitcoin, but I got my coins in 2012.
Since then, this is the 3rd Bitcoin bubble I've lived through. Never dreamed that it would go this crazy high!
However, both the previous Bitcoin bubbles popped and went back to the previous bubbles ATH. That would be around $1230 this time. 
It then went to $500 ish for a long time (half the height of the bubble). 
I dont think we'll drop to the previous ATH this time due to the massive exposure we've had... I do however think we could go sub $5000 then back up to around $10k. 
It then depends on how long until the LN goes live before another bubble takes off which could eclipse this one. 
A lot of 'buts' though... for example, if a load of kids kill themselves, regulations in the west could be coming to stomp this stupid speculative nonsense! ha
Good luck though mate, and well done for getting out... its not easy to sell is it! (I sold 90% of my coins at 17.5k)
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:56:22
Makes it sound like a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:02:38
I bet there are some hedge funds making an absolute killing from noobs throwing money at a coin just because it's cheap. This is going to be ridiculous when it pops
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:31:56
It's really not hard to understand. Hedge funds and big players can move the price up quite easily. Noobs FOMO on in... then the big money dumps their coins on the noobs. Rinse, repeat, maybe pick an alt to pump!
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:58
Yea, this isn't going to zero overnight my friend. Sure it could drop quite a bit more... but you're talking shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:39:23
Fair enough, which coins do you prefer? And have you really got zero holdings of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:07:11
Crypto is about making more money. I bet those people buying Ripple are hoping it goes up in value... I bet 90% have never even used the Ripple network. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:33
Who cares about feelings. This is and always has been a purely speculative asset, so it simply follows the speculative asset graph (which I'm sure you've seen). 
It is basically fractal, each time nearly identical!
Nobody buys Bitcoin because of the tech... they buy it because the price goes up. Until it doesn't. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:12:54
You must be new to Bitcoin if you think this is blood on the streets. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:16:44
True... and we've seen 3 massive bubbles in that time. 2013, then 2014 and now. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:52:23
Yes. Ether is more complex, so their is a bigger attack surface and also room for mistakes. Millions has been locked in poorly coded smart contracts
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:03:07
Yes, which it's following exactly yet again
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:58:41
FOMO personified 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:34:59
Sold most of them in December.
Still holding a couple as I'll get hammered with tax unless I can make it to April. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:53:27
I got in in 2012, let me tell you... you would probably have sold most of them long ago unless you are either already rich, or are the craziest gambler in the world. 
How would you have felt owning a few hundred coins when the value dropped from $1100 to something like $260 in 2014?
I sold most of my coins in 2013... I do feel a little bad, but I see this as essentially gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:10:24
Someone might have copied the key and resealed it
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:22:57
1200 to 280 was 2014... that was 4 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:22:31
Their scaling solution wouldn't work very well if crypto is to get huge. I'm talking millions of micro transactions per day. Massive blocks are a dumb and inefficient idea.
And again, you're being too short sighted on the fast and cheap 'right now' thing.
You should care about what it will be like in the coming years... Not during this highly speculative stage in cryptos life. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:05:59
Yea, I've got one (I moved the btc though). It's just a sticker you can put back on. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:09:08
I have one that I bought for $20 in 2012. I removed the sticker, moved the coin and stuck the sticker back on. It looks fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:48:48
Bitcoin goes through cycles of bubbling up and then crashing, followed by a bear market. 
It happened in 2013
it happened in 2014
It will happen now. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:05
I doubt it. Houses can't crash as far or as fast as crypto can. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:56:05
Most alts have smaller dev teams, and haven't had as much time in the wild being tested. If you're storing billions on a chain, you ideally want the most secure... That would be bitcoin.
Also, network effect, brand name, market liquidity and the fact that its sole purpose is as a currency/ store of value. Anything else just adds attack vectors.
And really, it's pretty obvious that speed and cost don't matter right now. Informed buyers know that bitcoin has a great solution in the pipeline. Nobody spends crypto at the moment anyway
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:39:15
Yes, its called FOMO... possibly a gambling addiction. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:55:16
People used to spend a few bitcoins for a small amount of weed. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:59:32
Really? If you make x4 gains... You don't panic sell if you're rapidly dropping back down to zero gains? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:39:14
Thanks for the update pal. Pretty sure most bagholders will be checking the price religiously on the way down. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:08:43
I know what it is, I have one. Pm me your email address I'll send you a snap with your username
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:37:09
It got back to 1100 in Jan 2014... so its debatable if the bubble had bust then or in December
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:27:14
They are reliable. They have to comply with AML requests... and check where your Bitcoin was from etc. They are under huge load at the moment from all of the people cashing out recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:21:34
OK, but tether is effectively dollars (people hope) if they are buying Bitcoin the price would go up (according to this guy)
If the price of Bitcoin is dropping, supply is high for Bitcoin (people are exiting)
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:04:15
Good points. I have bought my family some nice presents this year and I might give some homeless people some cash!
Pretty messed up state of affairs isn't it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:14:00
My perspective is that it doesn't matter what it is now. 
Second layer solutions like the LN will address most of your issues. Just need a little patience. 
Right now Bitcoin is a speculative commodity, LN will make it a highly functional currency / commodity hybrid. 
As for volatility, we're still at the price discovery phase. In theory volatility should reduce the higher we go (it costs too much for a few deep pocket investors to swing the price). 
Things like futures will also dampen volatility. 
So basically, buying Bitcoin is a bet that both of the above situations play out. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:01:42
Wait until when? How do I know that fees won't keep rising as more people buy in and move off exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:01:58
RemindMe! 2 months
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:21:03
A drop from nearly 20k to 15k is not what I would call a correction. 
Corrections are generally 10 to 20 percent. 
Unconfirmed transactions are pushing 300k and Tether has stopped new buyers. 
Things look ropey as shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:53:46
I bought my bitcoins for $8 each in 2012 nooby
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:09:28
Oh don't get me wrong, I've made a serious amount. I was just hoping we could have got through 20k.
I was looking forward to early retirement! Greed is a bastard isn't it.
£80 is £80 though! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:46:16
OK mate... except this time it tanked over 40%, had a fake recovery and is now bleeding south. Its basically a rerun of the 2013 and 2014 Bitcoin crashes (or any speculative bubble for that matter) 
In my opinion, this thing will continue to grind down, there will be relief rallies ... but thats just traders, trapping those bulls and squeezing those shorts. 
Yes, those September 17 guys are still in the green at the moment. A lot of folk underwater right now though. 
Bitcoin can go down as well as up my friend... its not a magic money tree. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:24:57
Its the shittest of shit coins and just the flavour of the week. 
Ethereum, BCH, Litecoin now this nonsense. 
Its basically hedge funds pumping some coin, those who hold it get a hard on and pump it everywhere... the big players dump on the noobs, cycle repeats. Until more people are burnt than are making money. 
This whole thing is a dumb speculative bubble. You don't even need xrp to use ripple! 
If Bitcoin does continue to plummet... the whole bubble will becoming down, regardless of whatever coin you have gabled on. .. just saying
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:09:26
I havent been sleeping well the last few days. 
I have sold so I can really enjoy Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:57:08
They weren't following a 42% crash... this is clearly a bubble, and this is clearly a dead car bounce. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:33:04
It's crashing, could go up a bit, but the general trend is down now
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:52:09
The only things that matter are network effect and liquidity. Bitcoin has a massive advantage over all alts in this regard. 
Also, Bitcoin is by far the most secure coin... having been attacked relentlessly for 8 years or so. No coin can come close (ever). 
Something like Ethereum could produce some interesting smart contracts... no need for it to have high value though. Its also shown to be pretty insecure with people having funds trapped for eternity in dodgy smart contracts. 
Alts like Monero are interesting... but sidechains will add anonymity to Bitcoin.  
Once the LN goes live, most alts will be blown out of the water. 
Alts are for noobs who missed the Bitcoin boat early on... or are saltly they cant own a whole Bitcoin. 
Alts are largely a waste of time and offer no real diversification. If Bitcoin crashes... alts will crash harder. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:25:36
We had that shit in both the 2013 and 2014 bitcoin bubbles. Nothing new, just bigger numbers.
And why isn't the price still sky rocketing if 100k new users are buying today? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:29:49
You try holding 320 coins during a crash son... that was my first experience of anything like that. It seriously looked like we were heading to zero. 
I didn't sell them all... and I have made a significant sum of money. Cant retire yet, but Its brought my retirement 20 years closer at least.  
I am not salty nor do I have any regrets what-so ever. This is gambling.

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:29:48
Yes, look at a 2 year chart of Bitcoin... Zoom out and you'll see what's happening.
All crypto is in a speculative bubble, you are about to buy near the top, probably on the way down.
Be very careful and at least wait until the new year.

@_date: 2017-12-26 11:48:44
It is mate... The problem with the price rising all the time is that your bet keeps getting greater.
I was losing sleep over the amount mine had grown to!
One word of advice from someone a little older. In 2013 I cashed out a similar amount. (just cashed out a lot more).
You sound like you have your head screwed on... But it's easy to blow through that money! I bought loads of crap that in hindsight I wish I hadn't.
Its a great base to build on at your age though

I hope you have taken some profits??
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:29:38
That would be nice. (that would make me very wealthy).
I don't think people 'use it' though...it's dumb to spend a deflationary asset.
I think we could see maybe 15 or 20k then tank to 2k or lower. Long run, who knows... Depends on how regulators react. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:27:16

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:46:53
OK, I support Core... I can just about stomach the fees at the moment. But what if the quadruple before LN is here? 
What was wrong with a small blocksize increase to help us get there?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:27:36
What if regulations come hard following this crash? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:30:35
It's pretty easy to see where this is heading if you zoom out on the chart and use your eyes.
Compare it to other speculative bubbles, and the previous bitcoin bubbles in 2013 and 2014.
Its basically exactly the same chart repeating.
This is one fake ass recovery... Low volume, slowly bleeding. If you've been in crypto a few years you've seen it before. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:38:27
What if the price continues to slide down?
Then his dad is out of pocket completely when he could have sold today and taken a hair cut. 
I would never convince someone, especially a relative or friend to put money into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:23:27
I think most of the ICo's are for bullshit ideas which aren't Internet 3.0.
I've seen nothing which I would actually want to use in reality.
Blockchain has a future, but it needs to be secured by something that isn't held for speculative gains.
If ethereum was based on a currency pegged to the dollar it could be useful.
Also, ethereums scaling problem is an order of magnitude harder than bitcoins.
One cat app clogged their network recently. Give me a break that it can be internet 3.0
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:12:00
Just chill out and enjoy Christmas. 
And be careful who you take advice from... if they own Bitcoin their opinion is going to be biased.
I personally wouldn't buy until at least the new year just to figure out where the market is heading.

@_date: 2017-12-23 06:24:48
In the previous bubbles it dipped to the ath of the previous bubble.
In 2014 it dropped from 1100 to 260.
So it could drop back to 1100 this time

Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:55:43
Surely Bitcoin is the ponzi scheme on that logic, not exchanges?
Exchanges are just that... they exchange BTC for Fiat.

I saw the price rise by $100 with a purchase of just 20 btc a couple of days ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:12:32
I guess the problem is, most people HODL Bitcoin... and their Bitcoin is in a legacy wallet. It costs money to send it to a Segwit address. 
I have no idea why Core haven't released their Segwit wallet yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:15:31
So you're saying banks can't stop you sending money to exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:21:17
What are these social implications? I was in Bitcoin to make money since 2012... and the same holds true today. All I see, is that there are more people who want to make money now. 
Same story, just more people. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:02:37
The technical analysts tool of choice
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:25:24
Well no, because people aren't using Segwit. If it costs you $10 to $20 to send coins from your legacy wallet to a Segwit wallet why bother. 
I guess we could partially blame Coinbase. 
And I know I'm shouting into the void here.... but seriously, unconfirmed txs are at 285k. 
I've sold most of my coins and I'm not buying back in because for all I know all the coins will be paralyzed for days if I send them anywhere before long. 
I'm not switching to an alt because I love Bitcoin... but is the chosen strategy really working? Or is it turning into a massive fuck up?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:38:43
I've been here since 2012 and my patience is being fucking tested I assure you. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:52:58
It is pretty cool, it enables trust on the internet and the storage of immutable facts. 
No idea how they will secure it though... a blockchain for just banks is gonna be tampered with :) ha 
Maybe a global network secured by a global currency linked to the Dollar? ... seems a few decades off. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:35:24
Why so emotional?
It's only money
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:10:19
It has, yes... its seen 80% drops. They don't recover straight away though. 
After the 2013 bubble popped it was months later until it inflated again. After that it then crashed again in 2014 from $1300 to something like $260... it was then in a bear market for 2 frikin years!!
This run has been absolutely bat shit crazy... thats why it is different. There is a long way down.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:12:21
In 2014 it dropped from 1100 to around 260. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:24
Alts are just as volatile. I've yet to see a smart contract that I would actually pay to use.. Not that into cats.
13 billion in daily volume, and about to grow massively, tells me plenty of people are trading bitcoin.
Its also young, so volatility in price discovery is to be expected. Its going to be a wild ride before it ever becomes useful as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:02
And so they should. We have a solid path to scale... its the idiots who blocked Segwit for so long who are responsible for the high fees and all the shitcoins ballooning up. 
Forking off all kinds of shit is a money grab at best, at worst its an attack on Bitcoin. 
Not worried though, what doesn't kill Bitcoin makes it stronger.

Maybe they are now millionaires so they're enjoying Xmas? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:31:53
More people are selling than buying, so the price goes down. 
If you don't understand the basics, I would suggest you pause and do some studies. 
These selling are either those who are happy with their profits
Fed up with poor network performance or have lost faith in Bitcoin.
Or they are selling at a loss having bought in above 12500
There are also traders mixed in who both buy and sell, hoping to make gains on volatility. 
Nobody can tell you what to do.

Bitcoin does follow this chart though. Bring up the charts of the 2013 bitcoin bubble, and the 2014 bitcoin bubble. They follow this chart exactly.
The only reason people are here is to make money... If that's true, this chart is what happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:57:23
What an original subject to bring up
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:11:15
Bcash is not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:49:38
It doesn't... In 2014 it crashed from 1100 to 260... Followed by a 2 year bear market.
Strap in hodlers
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:22:40
Supporting an attack on Bitcoin?... slow hand clap.
Nobody loses or gains anything unless they sell.   
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:16:12
How is looking an an obvious speculative bubble chart comforting? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:54:36
99% of Bitcoin holders dont care if its money. They buy it because its been going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:16:45


How does economic collapse and wide scale adoption of Bitcoin achieve that?
What makes you think an economy based on a deflationary currency would be stronger?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:47:06
You realise XRP is the biggest load of shit ever? The owners own most of it, and release it whenever they like. It's pre-mined and not scarce.
It's a joke
People buy it because it's cheap per coin.
They gave that shit away in 2013. They gave me 40k coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:57:46
Agreed, wouldn't touch this with a barge pole. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:56:40
It's on the news 24/7 man. My mum calls me telling me about the crash
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:56:12
Hardly out of the water yet. Have you seen Google Trends? Haven't we been tracking the term "buy bitcoin"? That's now diving.
All I'm saying is this has happened before,  and we're not free and clear until we cross 20k.
Its actually quite cheap to push the market up. It jumped $100 the other day from a purchase of just 20btc.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:36:23
And a lot of countries would do the opposite, just to spite them. 
Good luck banning math 
I'm not reading your entire wall of a post...but gambling is an interesting example. Just because the US banned online gambling, doesnt mean the rest of the world follow. They just keep on gambling.. you also highlight how people route around draconian attempts to block something. 
The price could go up if the US banned it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:59:55
like i said, crashes last for months. They don't go straight down... there's too much money to be made. 
If you have a few million Bitcoin is pretty easy to throw around and make it look like things are "back to normal". They'll keep raping the bulls until they give up 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:13:07
That money you're "earning" is just the next guy below you buying in. This isn't a money tree. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:26:36


You are not investing, you are gambling. Speculating at best. 
Yea, one central entity who holds billions of xrp and then release it on to idiots who throw their money at it, hoping to make more money. That'll end well. 
You dont even need xrp to use ripple! ha
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:36:48
Fair enough... I'm in the UK. Ive already used my capital gains allowance selling Bitcoin this year... wanted to wait until april to get a new CG allowance. I assumed it would be similar in the US?
I expect a wave of selling in Jan. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:45:34
I still think it's a dead cat bounce.
Hope it's not, it just did this in the previous crashes
 [](
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:38:18
Nice rant pal. Relax.
I assure you I'm pretty clued up on the technical aspects of Bitcoin. Bought mine in 2012.
I've also bought loads of alts, but I've sold them for bitcoin since. 
Sounds like you've got it all figured out, and you know better than the market which is telling you quite clearly that bitcoin is the top dog.
Its actually quite trivial to create what noobs would 'perceive' as a superior coin to Bitcoin... but you would be wrong in thinking it is actually "better".
Bitcoin has by far the biggest mind share, best dev team, largest infrastructure. It has been stress tested for the longest time (which you want if you are storing huge amounts of value). It is by far the most secure blockchain. 
And most importantly, it has huge liquidity (which is what the big money cares about) 
No alt will touch it at this point... But good luck with your flavour of the month coins. 
Honestly, you're better off with bitcoin, alts usually have their moment in the sun then fade. 
Ps... If Bitcoin crashes, alts crash harder
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:48:49
You have no idea how much of this monumental rally was from small buys. Also  if big money wanted bitcoin... Why did nobody buy the futures? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:19:53
I have been in crypto since 2012, but also follow regular financial media. This is absolutely not stealth phase... It's a mania. It's already had a blow off top, and now we're in the bull trap in my view
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:51
Is 280k unconfirmed transactions healthy growth?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:46:53
There's a lot of financial illiteracy in the world, and a lot of people who are fed up of zero interest rates and low wage growth. This is the prefect recipe for ridiculous speculative bubbles. Compound that with social media, and reddit where positive sentiment is up voted and rational negative sentiment is down voted and things can get crazy.
It's pretty entertaining to watch... It won't be when real people start to get hurt. I wonder how many people are holding the bag after buying this at near 20k on credit card!?
I actually feel pretty guilty for making money here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:52
No need for this chart, we are returning to normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:59:55
Sorry? I'm not a bot. The advice to your friend is beyond reckless.
Bitcoin has crashed multiple times in its life, and in my view is currently crashing again
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:00:34
If people are mostly buying crypto to make money, no it doesn't matter.
You can make money on virtually anything in that scenario... When it's going up that is. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:00:37
Probably the last fucking huge transaction fee I was forced to pay to some miner
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:34:13
This discussion has been done to death over the years.
Nothing will change mate.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:47
Depends how leveraged up financial institutions got. It's not going to happen though
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:52:00
A target from who?
How about the guys with million dollar bank accounts in r/FIRE or r/investing... are they targets?
And there is no reason I would make that up... its been pretty trivial to make that sum of money considering how stupidly over priced this had become. You are late to the game. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:35:01
I wouldn't bother $20 is next to nothing and you're gonna look pretty stupid if this market keeps dropping. 
Your present will get less valuable! ha 
And yes, they would have nothing left if they wanted to move them off the exchange due to fees. 
Should you buy another crypto? I don't know, seems like you are just putting money in something you don't understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:14:45
99 percent easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:21:32
He seems like a top guy!
Not sold on Bitcoin, but not written it off either. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:31
Yea I know... It's market manipulation. Been happening for years. It's illegal in regulated markets.
I'm not saying there aren't big players here, there are. They are the guys who are causing the fake recoveries... Noobs get excited buy "cheap" and the big dogs dump on them.
I might even have a go this time... There will probably be a dead cat bounce in the coming days
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:46:41
I know, stocks have some intrinsic value. This is just based on attracting new users to buy the next coin higher than you.
The media have turned against bitcoin. The tech is failing hard...and governments are taking a hard look at crypto.
The new users we can recruit are slowing down. 
This ain't crossing 20k anytime soon, if ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:12:30
My point is there is very little intrinsic value in any of this. Especially considering most people are buying because they want to make money.
My mum and a few friends wanted to buy bitcoin and ethereum ... You think they give a flying fuck about what the underlying thing is suppose to do? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:12
Because I believe this is an historic moment. You can read about Tulip mania... but you can frikin watch a speculative mania / bubble in real time here! Possibly the purist one ever. 
Its fascinating!! Bitcoin will be in the history books. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:11:31
Yes, that's how this works.
For what it's worth, bitcoin it's older than 5 years. And you weren't that early in on the game
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:45:19

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:18
How is that different? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:23
Whats happening there?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:19
Why the fuck would they coordinate a cash out. That means they would all be selling during a crash. If you're going to cash out do it on your own so you don't drop the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:59:47
Yes, the liquidity is the only thing that matters really... big boys are only going to want to invest in the markets with the largest liquidity so they know they can exit their positions.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be fast and cheap at the moment... You'd have to be retarded to spend crypto at the moment. 
It just needs to 10x plus in price and become stable. It's the only coin that has a chance of doing that. 
By then it will have LN activated and be a currency. 
Actually, being slow and expensive puts it in a reasonable position to escape the coming onslaught of regulation (ICo's will be battered) 
Bitcoin is in Trojan horse mode atm. 
I can't be fucked with gambling on alts, trying to figure out which one is the next flavour of the month.
The only two that are worth anything are monero (for buying drugs) and maybe ethereum. Though to date it's only purpose has been shitting out hundreds of scamcoins. I have yet to see a smart contract that I'll actually use. 
And no, I'm not salty mate. I bought my coins for $8 each in 2012.
Enjoy your boom/bust pump and dump toys.

All money in crypto is dumb money
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:42:48
The vast majority of the community are fully behind Core.
LN is very much in sight. 
Current usage is largely irrelevant as all anyone is doing at the moment is speculating. 
Good luck picking whichever shit coin is being pumped this week. 
I've already made a ton of money, so no need to feel sorry for me. 
Feel sorry for the noob bag holders who arrived only in the last 12 months. The coming crash is going to shake them hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:11:55
Fuck me that onion article is funny...

If Bitcoin came close to damaging banks and the wider economy, banks would just ban you from sending money to bitcoin exchanges. Game over

Well there was one after the 2013 crash, and the 2014 crash. 
I bloody panic bought back into the 2014 one only to have to ride that bloody thing all the way down again! ... not sure if I will this time. I want to enjoy xmas, not watch charts. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:41:25
My patience is thin, mixed with the stress of the last few weeks. I sold half yesterday. I want to enjoy xmas!
Look at those unconfirmed transactions... 286k!!! Feels like its grinding to a halt.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:12:02
Why would you buy any if you think thats what crypto is?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:23:34
It was mostly people sending coins to exchanges to sell. I paid fucking $80 to send one god damn bitcoin.
If this crashes properly, you will lose all your money just in fees!!
I fucking hate that i was forced to keep my coins on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:42:47

No idea why your age come into this. 
In the UK your CGT allowance is 11.3k

If you go over that you pay 10% then up to 20%... depends how much over.

Crypto wouldn't be anywhere without a little noob greed. 
No need to make them feel bad. A lot are just poor millennials who are fed up with shit jobs, no savings, pensions, houses, overpriced stock market and low interest rates.
I feel quite sorry for them to be honest.

How many years have you been in Bitcoin? You know this has been in a few bubbles before and absolutely tanked?
I'd be pretty worried if I had paid any more than $1 or $2k for a coin. 
What do you think the World will be like in 10 years? You think people will be pinging Bitcoin around instead of FIAT, and Governments wont mind?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:47

I think most of the anarchists moved over to BCH. 
To be fair, a lot of the media is bullshit.

100% ... hedging with alts is dumb. If Bitcoin crashes, all crypto crashes. 
Its got the biggest liquidity by far. 
Alts are mostly pump and dumps
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:16:49
I panic sold 300 coins in 2013. I don't panic anymore. I sold just after the bubble burst this time.
I'm not buying into this weak ass fake recovery
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:24:08
I'm not surprised their spreads are shit in a volatile market like this. They could easily lose money. I'm guessing they buy bitcoin to hedge what is effectively a CFD.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:04:54
I like Jim... This guy not so much. He just chucks figures out of his ass.
Last week he was launching a 500mil crypto hedge fund and said crypto could have a 40 percent drop then reach 100k.

Are you sure that won't lead to cult like behaviour? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:10:34
They could order banks to close accounts of anyone receiving or sending money to bitcoin exchanges. Your money would be stuck on exchanges forcing you to swap it for crypto and try to cash out through amazon gift cards or something else
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:29:34
I sold 2 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:13:28
Just relax man, its (most likely) traders taking advantage of noobs who panic right now. 
Eth is rallying, that tells me this is just traders making money. 
It will likely flow back for the next run up. 
If you see all alts tank hard at the same time, then its time to worry.

@_date: 2017-12-27 21:20:28
Yea, of course they could "ban" it... they banned Gold once. 
They would have about as much success at killing it as they have done with killing online drug markets and torrents. A ban in the US, does not mean the rest of the World cant use it. 
There's no switch for them to flick though. You're just transmitting  a number over the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:07:39
Bitcoin is not an investment you clown. It's speculation, we're well aware of the risks. If you have low risk tolerance that's cool, go post on a sub talking about bonds or something.
You recommend alts which have equal risk... If Bitcoin goes down, all crypto goes down. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:09:23
Fair enough, you don't think this looks and feels exactly like the previous bubbles though in 2013 and 14?
I'm not trolling really, it's just that my view is opposite to others, so it just looks like that to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:35:13

@_date: 2017-12-30 11:41:20
I imagine you can open a limit order for 16k and buy a coin.. 
I have a coin you can buy for 16k if you want it?
Temporarily that would then be the price of Bitcoin on that exchange. Until the next trade is made. 
Most people however are rational and wouldn't buy something so far over spot. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:13:48
Except everyone here is a speculator and you know it.
 Reversion to mean would be around 6k. Reversion to the previous bubbles ATH would be $1300.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:55:39
Its fucking beyond me why core wont increase the blocksize even a little. 
I'm also amazed they haven't released a segwit enabled wallet yet too. 
I dont like Bcash. 
I shouted NO2X
But jesus fucking christ... a 2mb block is not going to kill the project. 
Quite the opposite.
My coins are stuck on an exchange as I don't want to pay fees and wait days for them to move. 
The only reason I can think at this point is they are either too proud to implement this having said no to 2x... or they are all stinking rich and no longer care. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:35:05

Do you think a new US tax year might cause a sell off though? I'm not from the US, so I'm not sure about it. 
In the UK we have to wait until April to get a new CG allowance!

I don't care where he was educated, anyone can fall for a scam. 
How about listening to Warren Buffet? He's seen more speculative bubbles that this Hedge fund manager who is up to his ass in Crypto. Warren called it a mirage. 
I think you know deep down that the only reason the price goes up, is because people buy it... which causes the price to go up. 
It doesn't matter what the underlying thing that you're speculating on is... eventually it crashes.   
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:59:13
Is this your first Bitcoin crash?

@_date: 2017-12-28 11:33:16
You realize that makes no sense right?
For a Bitcoin to be bought, someone must have deposited enough money to the exchange to buy it. 
The exchange don't need huge reserves. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:42:39
It's impossible to give it a value.
That's why it's destined to be boom and bust until banks cut off funds getting to exchanges. 
It's only worth what the next guy is willing to pay (the greater fool).
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:05
Don't buy until it stabilises. Wait until at least mid Jan after the US tax season to make a decision

Ok, you read that as if you should only buy more if it drops below 5k then? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:37:05
Sure, lots of people here are hoping to make some money. But a lot of people also expect Bitcoin to be widely used as a either a currency or commodity in the future.(or a hybrid). If it is going to be a large player (instead of the tiny player it is now), it makes sense to buy some now that its cheap (relative to where it will be). 
So take your bets... either its a bubble, and pray you sell it before it pops. 
Or its a new asset class and spend the rest of your life regretting every single time you pressed that sell button. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:02:19
I rode that fucker down in 2014 and the 2 year bear market after. It was pretty bad... going to be brutal if this one drops to the previous ATH support of $1200. (280 was roughly the previous ATH to the 2013 bubble). 
I cant face it again so I'm out! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:21:59
Well it depends on your perspective of who I'm helping doesn't it. Maybe I'm helping those guys who are thinking of buying in, when it's heading down.
Can this sub only be bullish, positive news? That doesn't sound healthy... That could just encourage a speculative bubble! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:09:06
Worse than me? I sold 320 coins in 2013 when that bubble popped. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:39:29

What makes you think a bull run is coming?

Lol, she bought it at $10 and sold it for a nice profit. 
She doesn't give a shit about the tech. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:19:06
My faith is mostly gone. I've kept a couple of bitcoins just in case this ridiculous thing ever bubbles up again.
Sorry to say, I think we're crashing and regulations will follow.
Bearish I know.
LN could work perfectly... But the cult of hodl means nobody has an incentive to spend. Especially a deflationary currency.
So, LN might be as successful as segwit is. 
Well over a year or being annoyed every time I moved a coin has worn me the fuck out.
Also, things are getting out of hand... Coinbase insider trading etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:27:52
Fear is your brain telling you to be careful. I was fearful when everyone was greedy... and I have made a lot of money due to that fear. 
When everyone starts shitting themselves, I may buy back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:37:30
You know your strategy doesn't actually move the markets?
It can also make you look very silly in the long term.
Trolls have been talking bitcoin down since I arrived... Just look at buttcoin!
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:31:41
Oh well done, so you're strategy is pump, sell, then troll?
I don't bother short term trading. Been more of a hodler since $8 a coin. It's worked out reasonably well for me

I'm not crying about Ripple, chuck all the money you like at it. Just trying to save a few people from buying in to an obvious pump. 
Its also not really a crypto currency. Its a corporate owned token. 
Its also a prime example of why this speculative bubble is so stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:46:17
Yea, blockchain tech is useful... they have to find a way to secure the network without a token which is prone to speculation though.

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:09:59
Fair enough... for what its worth, my coins are in a Segwit wallet. I was just playing devils advocate on why Segwit isn't being used much. 
It would really help if Core released a Segwit client!!!!! WTF...
Bitstamp have had Segwit for ages!
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:13:12
You're just trying to convince yourself you made the right choice. You'll probably panic buy back in soon
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:53:47
I don't think it'll effect the economy. It could if it's allowed another run in the coming years.
There was never 600 billion in this anyway.
I'll be spending the money I've made which will stimulate the economy. Others have lost some savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:30:56
It might have been the back end of 2012 I gave them to him. They cost me £8 each... So things like that didn't really matter.
I gave a girl 0.3 bitcoin once to show her how this worked.
I also once sent 10 btc to a Vpn provider by accident! Luckily they sent it back. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:47:15
A 42 percent drop and lame recovery is not a correction.
Look at the Bitcoin bubble crashes of 2013 and 2014. The charts are basically identical.
Bitcoin could continue to fall. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:37:58
When you stop with the positive comments bitcoin always.
This is too much fun

Ok mate, enjoy your crazily centralised, government friendly coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:04:37
Good one. 
How can it compete with the real Bitcoin when the LN is active?
Instant and extremely cheap transactions... which can scale without ridiculously huge blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:27:26
Can we make it the 1st Jan? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:15:01
I have mostly traded it for very usable GBP now. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:01:29
They would if Bitcoin became a risk to the world economy. World banks could just ban you from sending money to exchanges too.
If bitcoin got to 100k then crashed 42 percent like the other day, contagion could drop other markets.
You don't want that.

Which is completely correct, it fell 42 percent.
That's about as bad as the last stock market crash following 2008 was

At $2.35 a coin, that values Ripple about the same as VISA. 
Of all of the episodes of this ridiculous speculative bubble, ripple has to take the prize for the dumbest of dumb money.

Sold yesterday mate. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:51:00
Those paper profits (or blockfolio profits) aren't real unless you sell....you've made nothing
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:38:39
This is essentially gambling. You're making a bet that it can reach 34k. This guy doesn't.
It's actually pretty good to have posts when people make lots of money as that's what attracts new speculators.
After 5 years of hodling I sold all but 2 coins recently and couldn't be happier. This 'recovery' doesn't bother me as it could be fake.
You'll disagree.. I actually hope it does get back to 20k or beyond so I can sell my remaining coins!. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:06:32
Except some people may be more inclined to buy bitcoin if they can hedge it with futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:13:45
No, this chart shows the lifecycle of a speculative bubble... Not just any asset. 
Most assets don't go parabolic...only speculative bubbles do. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:59:42
It is exciting if you bought Bitcoin cheap! I got mine for $8 years ago. The price right now is bat shit crazy to me!!
The concept is cool... but human greed means this thing will probably never work. 
It would only work if you could spend it everywhere.

Didnt he say he'd sold the majority of his Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:38
Of course the price went up, traders play on people who panic like you. 
I bet you are now thinking of panic buying back in?! ha
If you dont like the memes here, get your news from elsewhere. 
Second layer solutions will bring anonymity, and will make most alts obsolete. Bitcoin has by FAR the biggest network effect which is ALL that matters.
 
I like Monero, but I dont think it will ever get much traction because of the low liquidity. 
12 Billion in trading volume for Bitcoin today!!
But anyway, I dont think you should be invested in crypto my friend.

That's probably a good first step after the last Bitcoin ETF was refused. 
The more financial products, the better in my view. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:57:28
The ETFs were denied last time because exchanges are largely unregulated. Coinbase is a prime example of inside trading... so I cant see a Bitcoin ETF being accepted.
Derivative ETFs with Bitcoin futures could be... but there doesnt seem much appetite for Bitcoin futures on wallstreet.

Whats his logic on this I wonder?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:50:16
Source? So you're saying people don't invest more than they should?
In 2012 I didn't have a fucking clue... I invested 3k despite having student and credit card debt. It worked out well for me. It's getting pretty late in the game now though in my view. 
I just made a small fortune (not enough to retire)... That money came from noobs like I was in 2012. It's effectively a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:34:19
Cool, I'd be amazed if we touch 20k again without the network problem fixed. Good luck though
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:48:38
Fair enough mate. 
I felt like that in 2013 when I bought for $8. Over time I have realized that swapping them back for money is pretty cool too.
Bitcoin has too many problems at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:32:15
A good old fashioned dead cat bounce. 
Let the games begin!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:50
Well its manipulation however you look at it. 
Not illegal, but fucking scummy behavior to rip off your clients. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:25:29
I have no idea to be fair... history tells me back the previous bubbles ATH ($1300). That would truly be blood on the streets. 
Its tough to call this one (its crypto after all)... people have the knowledge that after hitting those depths, Bitcoin recovers to about half of the ATH, then fades slowly for ages. 
It depends on things like how bad the media slate Bitcoin, and if there are any regulatory movements by Governments to protect the Mums and Grandmas throwing money at something they shouldn't.
This could get very very ugly. 
Of course this is Crypto, anything can and will happen... there's a conspiracy that wall street caused this crash! and want cheap coins!!!
I dont buy it, as they showed little interest in the futures.. But who knows with that lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:41:24
Its a trap!
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:26:02
I sold at 16k are my hands weak? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:54:49
Not really... You can make money buying into a speculative bubble. You just have to force yourself to sell at peak mania (last week) 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:03:49
They both crashed harder. I'm talking about both the 2013 and 2014 crashes. This feels like the typical "return to normal".
Just traders pushing the price up on low volume. It only takes about 20btc to move the market £100
On one, we bounced all the way back to double top the ath. Then it crashed again. 
I may be wrong. Just feels off to me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:28:41
It can't be that easy otherwise you'd have every bcash supporter doing it 24/7
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:49:51
lol, ok. Good luck. 


One pump over a few days and you all become massively deluded.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:06
At least its a viable scaling solution that wont result in being controlled by a few miners. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:55:34
No chance. Can you imagine a 40 percent drop from 100k?
That could damage the worlds economy... No way banks and government will let this stupidity go that far.
Banks just need to ban people sending money to bitcoin exchanges... Game over.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:41:59
Why did I buy Bitcoin? To make money!
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:08:38
Tether is fucking terrifying. It's supposedly backed by money in a bank. I'm not sure what is supposed to happen if the crash continues and all crypto is sold for tether. The demand for tether would outstrip any fiat in those accounts.
There is no legal obligation for the tether company to let you redeem fiat!! Its just assumed.
The US government are just going to see it as counterfeit dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:27
The last two bubbles returned to the previous bubbles all time high.
That would be around $1100
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:58
That's exactly what's happening. I've been in Bitcoin since 2012 and I sold 2 days ago. I'm not even a whale... Whales would have thousands on bitcoin

@_date: 2017-12-24 17:05:30
This is blatantly a bubble. 
Bitcoin is neither a store of value or a currency. It just dropped pushing 40% and the fees are ridiculous. It cost me £80 to move a Bitcoin the other day... that's not great for a currency. 
Nobody gives a flying fuck about the tech anyway... everyone is here to make money, even you, which is why you have wide eyes for 50k.
You're pretty late to the game my friend.

Are you trying to rationalise losing money? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:24:51
Totally up to the individual. 
Depends on your salary, net worth, debt level, cost of living, risk tolerance, belief in Bitcoins long term viability.
Its different for everyone. 
I've sold at various points over the years... and regretted ever single damn time. 
Make a plan when the markets are calm and execute it. 
I would also say, never go full fiat... if moon is 40 or 100k you could regret it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:57:34
Yea, I'm bored of waiting... And fucking pissed with the hundreds of dollars in fees I've given to miners. 
It's killed this rally and given rise to alts and fucking forks. 
BCH is overkill, but 2mb was not too much to ask.
I know, I know use segwit.
But if it costs me £80 to migrate each bitcoin to a segwit wallet... Wtf is the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:02:33
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:44:41
So lots of people will swap a currency thats free to send, with a currency that costs $30 to send?
I paid £80 to send one bitcoin last week. That's ridiculous.

Just traders walking it slowly back up. Let's see how we stand on the 1st Jan shall we?
New tax year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:35:48
Well I would call those previous drops corrections... And this drop a crash (ongoing).
Who knows though... I think sub 10k before new year
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:43:46
The way it was done was clearly meant to damage Bitcoin. No reason to not advise it will be launched in advance. A lot of people lost money because of this. 
Which is absolutely disgusting considering they let you buy Bitcoin from their site... then try to damage its worth!!! WTF is that!! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:21:56
The tech is great.
Human greed, stupidity and speculation are the problem. 
Buy low sell high, thats great. I bought at $8... pretty much any price is high for me. 
This bubble could inflate again in a year or so... but it will just be the same shit, over and over. 
Its the same as the stock market, but this happens really fast. 
People will never learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:29
I paid $8 for my Bitcoins, I wouldn't say I have weak hands. I just want to take some profit off the table.
Yesterday was bullshit and fees are fucking stupid right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:29
I'm not from the US... but dont you think the market would price in the expected jan 1st sell off now?
I'm taking a 20% tax hit now... but thats not bad if I expect the price to drop 20%+ more.
I've not been sleeping very well lately, this shit is too stressful! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:21:28
This is the third bubble since 2013.
Each time you have more on the table, so more risk. It gets unbearable... And those sweet paper profits look more enticing.
There haven't been dozens of these. There have been dozens of corrections... This is a crash. I'm not riding this thing down again.
Could it bubble up again after this cycle? Maybe... I'm not so sure.
If it 10x again it could literally disrupt the global economy if it crashes. Global government regulations are coming in my view. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:37:12
I sold 2 days ago... Be fearful when everyone else is greedy
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:46:32
Fair enough. I guess the problem is during this cycle that you can't know when the crash will be.
Each dip has been heavily bought up by someone with serious money.
It wouldn't surprise me if the hedge funds push this market to 20k or even 40k.
If the cycle does repeat 2013 and 14 bubbles you could get in cheaper than today at some point in the future I guess.
Going to be rough for you to watch the price rising though.
If it was going to crash in this movement, it would have done so already... Just wait until futures go live. People are uncertain, be pretty dumb for institutional money to create future's market just to short once. Far more money to be made from this market than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:25:36
Stupid warning.
They are very clear that you cant move Bitcoin from Reolut. 
5% off spot isnt bad. If you send £s to a euro exchange (forex cost and fees)... buy Bitcoin (fees), sell bitcoin (fees), transfer back to the UK (fees and forex loss)... that works out more than 5%
Also you have fees if you move Bitcoin!!!
Its a safe way of gaining exposure to crypto, without having to bother with storage of Bitcoin. 
Its a pretty cool and easy to use service for a lot of people. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:31:21
Well done mate, absolutely no shame in taking a pretty epic return off the table. 
I did the same... xmas is gonna be good!

I think its the speed at which this market can switch around. Its pretty easy to miss the reentry point and have to buy in higher.
Saying that, this run all got a bit stressful for me, so I bailed all but 2 coins at 17k.

I have a reasonable understanding of this first gen tech. Couldn't really explain what a merckle tree is though.
My belief in Bitcoin has changed over the years though.
Primarily, the tech is irrelevant if everyone buys bitcoin simply because the price is rising. That renders it a ponzi scheme. If people just cared about the tech there would be no crashes or panic sell offs.
The tech itself whilst interesting, is full of problems. It consumes an insane amount of power, the LN could scale it, but why? Nobody spends it.
From an economic perspective a deflationary currency is a dumb idea, because there's no incentive to spend an asset that could be worth more in the future.
From a market perspective, it's easy for whales to manipulate the price up. Just buy loads on low volume driving through psychological barriers. FOMO noobs then buy pushing it up to insane levels.
Methods made illegal in regular markets like painting the tape green are also used.
There's huge insider trading on exchanges too.
From a regulatory standpoint, there's no way governments and banks will let this go to 100k...it would literally risk damaging the world economy on its next cyclical crash. It's trivial to hurt bitcoin hard.
Just tell banks it's illegal to send money to exchanges.
Tether looks ropey as hell, might not be backed up by real money and anything pegged to the dollar could be viewed as counterfeit dollars. They are going to be in trouble.
Blockchain could work if it crypto was pegged to a stable currency which may happen...but it won't be bitcoin.
I still hold a couple of coins for the fun of it though. I've also made a ton of money.
Good luck dealing with the stress of holding this if it ever got anywhere near 100k. If most of your net worth is gambled on something that can drop 80 percent your life becomes consumed by it.
It wasn't meant to be, but this operates like a ponzi. The early adopters (2012 wasn't that long ago) hold most of the coins. You noobs are just buying the few that are available... Pushing the price up. Until it goes down.
This crash hasn't even finished. This recovery is fake. Bull trap/short squeeze / car dead cat bounce... Call it what you will
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:24:53
Yes, you are asking the wrong audience. Everyone here is balls deep in Bitcoin... or course they are going to tell you to buy. 
My opinion (I hold Bitcoin)... unless you are dropping 10's of thousands into it now, does it really matter if its 12k or 13k? 
This thing is either going to 40k plus, or it will fail. 
Make your mind up if you can handle the stress and potential loss and make a decision. Your indecisiveness has kept you out of the game... perhaps it is not for you.
This does look like a gigantic bubble.
But, the birth of a new financial asset class would also look like a bubble. 
None of us here can help you, we don't fucking know either!
Good luck.

Shit mate, sorry to read your story. Sounds like malware got you.
The problem with personal moons is, once you get there, you want more.
Mine wasn't my personal moon, it was my risk tolerance. Which is actually quite high... but everyone has a limit.
Honestly, I can't ever see this being stable if it's full of people who want to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:24:46
I'm not praying. I actually still hold 2 BTC in case people are dumb enough to keep pumping money into it.
Are hands really weak if they are holding a few hundred thousand dollars worth and it starts to tank?
Bitcoin bubbles have dropped 80% in the past.... you're not weak if you want to protect your gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:11:49
That's why I was selling on the way up. 
In previous crashes you couldn't even log on to exchanges to sell. 
Also, for all I knew the whole network could have ground to a halt. 
I had a charge of fucking £80 sending one lot to the exchange. 
Selling on the way up is pretty hard to do... most people cant sell ever due to greed. 
The liquidity was surprisingly good when I was selling during the initial panic of this crash... didn't have too much slippage.

It is not, and doesn't need to be a currency at the moment. Nobody wants to spend Bitcoin... and thats fine.

Ok.. well in 2013 it dropped from 260 to around 50.
In 2014 it dropped from 1100 to around 250. 
No idea where this will go... could be brutal. 
Saying that, this rally has surprised me before.
I expect a bulltrap (or dead cat bounce)... then a bear market. 
Unlikely we'll get past 20k anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:03:53
I would be nervous investing in alts after a big pump, traders might just sell and use their gains to pump Bitcoin for the coming Futures. You might be on the wrong side of the pump. 
Also, if Bitcoin crashes... all of crypto is coming down.

@_date: 2017-12-24 06:31:31
I know right! I told one guy how much I've cashed out (a significant amount) he basically said that I was stupid and should have hodled until it was worth a million. That's like winning on roulette and then putting it all back on red to me.
I hadn't been sleeping very well, and feel so much better now!
I was under the hodl spell for a while, this time I broke it and sold slowly on the way up though. Counter intuitive, but it's worked out well. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:52:11
I never wrote what you've got there in quotes so I don't think thats fair. 
To clarify my view:
Bitcoin is a bubble, because everyone is speculating and the majority don't seem to care about the tech. 
Its a bubble because it has gone parabolic... that's generally a sign that something is bubble. 
Its also not an investment. Its speculation at best... but honestly, I see it more like gambling. Every one is conditioned to HODL, with shaming if your "weak hands" actually want to realize your gains. 
The market is moved using dodgy techniques which are illegal in regulated markets... and Bitcoin its self if pretty useless except for being an excellent tool to pass money from noobs to old hodlers and traders. 
In investing you are generally buying the right to future expected dividends, and a share of the assets of a company or fund. 
Here you buy in the hope that more people will pile in. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:03
Sure, every few years bitcoin bubbles up and crashes hard. Look at the history. 2011, 2013, 2014.
This could easily be a 80 percent drop.
That and the fact that anyone with eyes can see this is a speculative bubble.
And the fact that anyone who knows anything about finance has been telling everyone this is a bubble.
These usually drop back to the previous bubbles ATH. That was $1100 back in 2014

Traders will be buying Bitcoin and using the derivatives too. 
Buy up a ton of Bitcoin... sell it, whilst dumping. Double profit. 
It also allows longs to hedge their position... so they are more likely to buy more Bitcoin in that scenario. 
So in short, they could just tank Bitcoin out of the gate and make one big killing. 
Or they could keep the Golden Goose alive and make long term profits pushing the large number of noobs around. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:16:02

Coinbase and Vers bullshit and the insane fees also made my mind up.

Why? It wasn't that long ago mate.
I read an article in gawker about the SR and bought a few.
I paid for a vpn with the things. Then more people bought, the price went up, so I bought more.
I sold about 320 coins in the 2013 crash, and held since.
Well, I've been selling on the way up... But I have made a considerable sum.
Lots of people from that era are in the 21 club.
The price even today is fucking insanity if you ask me.

Ethereum's scaling issue dwarfs Bitcoins problem. It literally ground to a halt due to one Cat app not long ago.
It is going to struggle if anyone actually creates a useful smart contract that could be used by the masses. 
I think we can all agree that when LN arrives, it will make Ethereum look slow and a poor currency.
The fees right now dont matter to most HODLrs.... only the late comers who just buy alts because they are 'cheap'
Ethereum is also less valued as a store of value because of the large r attack surface that it has. It is turing complete so easier for bugs and hacks to happen. 
A couple of time now, huge amounts of money has been locked for eternity in poorly coded smart contracts.
Those looking for a store of value, or currency dont want that.
Bitcoin beats all alts because of the network effect and its market liquidity. It is on the financial news 24/7. Als are not. 
No alt will come close, even if it did... that would undermine the whole cryptospace. 
If the coin can just be replaced ever few years.. why risk your money at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:27:54

What do you mean by "the future"? I think most people with a basic understanding of economics would tell you why a deflationary currency is a terrible idea (hint, nobody spends it). If crypto currencies are the future (replace national currency) they will be government issued and inflationary.
I think bitcoin has more of a chance of succeeding as a commodity. It could however easily be crushed by banks and government if they see it as a threat, and not the wildly speculative money making toy it is at present.
The bet is that most people actually care about crypto, and aren't here hoping to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:44:48

@_date: 2017-12-16 06:03:05
Ok, what's your point? If you throw enough money at random alts, you may pick one that will succeed?
There's thousands, I really can't be fucked to do that.
The quality of devs doesn't impact how many forks there are. They are just the next attack vectors which attempt to dethrone bitcoin. Truth is, they just make bitcoin stronger. 
Bitcoin has by far the best chance of breaking though the mainstream and becoming the defacto global crypto.
Maybe you've missed it, but Bitcoin is all over the financial news 24/7.
It's what the big boys want. If you're in the crypto space and don't hold any bitcoin... You're basically retarded (or poor) 
Can something like eth be successful? Sure, smart contracts might be useful for some things. I haven't seen any i really want to use though.
Secondly, why are you being such a dick? Has making a few dollars gone to your head? 
You need to get on top of that, emotions can cost you money. 
If you're saying "it's the tech thats important"... Why are you so emotional about the tech? You complete fucking nerd! 
The only reason I can think that you'd get emotional is that you're actually here for the money. In which case, I'm sorry you found crypto so late. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:59:34
Nah, I'm good. I don't like the people involved, or the community. I think I'd just exit the space entirely if Bitcoin can be cloned.

A group of people who own Bitcoin yes? I guess that advice is based on the observation that prices generally have fallen in previous years in Bitcoin at Xmas. That is true... however, this does look like a proper crash to me. I sold 3 days ago, so I am biased I guess. 
Just ask yourself, or non investing friends to look at the chart and decide if it either 'looks cheap' or 'looks like its trend is downward'. 
FWIW, I've never seen Bitcoin drop 40% and recover to the ATH rapidly... took months, or years to get back there.

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:38
10k still seems like a ridiculous price... I bought my coins for $8!
But yea, we're going below 10 for sure
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:04:08
The psychology is interesting isn't it. You can literally see it on r/reddit... Bullish and bearish. Traders must be making a killing as you can use that as a signal. 
I sold a few hundred coins in the 2013 bubble. Panic bought back into the 2014 bubble.... Then rode it down from $1100 to something like $260. It was hard...but it's paid off.
That was followed by a 2 year bear market, so strap yourself in.
The problem exiting this thing is taxes. Even if Trump declared he liked bitcoin tomorrow, I still owe a boatload of tax now! I'm happy though, and it's nice to get my life back.
 
I'm still in here though :)
Good luck to you!

You haven't really addressed his point. Debt is pretty useful to most people. Most folk don't have sufficient capital to buy houses and start businesses... so borrowing is needed. 
Even in a Bitcoin based world (not going to happen)... some people would need to borrow. 
And no, banks aren't scared of Bitcoin. They can simply stop transfers from accounts to and from Bitcoin exchanges.

@_date: 2017-12-05 19:19:08
Had hundreds in 2013, bubble burst and sold the lot at circa $200.
My mindset? This game is over... I have made out like a fucking gangster. Who are these idiots buying off me at $200 and falling?
it tanked to sub $70. 
I felt a mixture of happyness (I had made what I thought at the time was a lot of money)... and also a weird hatred of Bitcoin. I wanted people to know that I had made the right choice, and Bitcoin would be crushed by Governments and regulation. 
A few months later I panic bought back a few as it looked like I was wrong. Rode it up to $1100... then rode a horrendous crash back down to sub $500 I think (probably lower). 
2 years of forgetting about it, and watching my coins lose value. Then this rally started. 
I guess I do feel regret for selling... but you seriously have to have strong hands to hold for years. I could have been a multimillionaire... but my psychology didn't let me. How people who are not already wealthy have held significant sums of coins until today is beyond me. 
10k plus is absolutely ridiculous!
I also had an email to swap 1BTC for 2500 Ether. But chose not to, as it looked like a highly inflationary shitcoin. 
I try and view this as gambling now. 
If you folded a poker hand and later found out you would have won... its not so bad.

I don't really have that much attachment to any coin, otherwise I wouldn't have sold after 5 years of HODLING. I'm mostly in this for the money. As 99% of people are, you can pretend you care about scaling solutions and speed etc. But in the end this is just one big fucking speculative bubble which has already started its descent. 
Those clowns who are being urged to by Ethereum are just enriching those who have been here a few years. Dumb, late money. 
Its all about the money, not the tech period. 
I still think that when second layer solutions are merged with the massive network effect of BTC, it will destroy most of the alts. 
But honestly, I don't care that much. Its like arguing which is the best ponzi scheme. 
Try not to lose your 5 BTC worth by being greedy in the end stages of a speculative bubble.

Bitcoin Network HashRate currently 7007p Bitcash 455p.
Not bad, but hardly taking over. 
There are established communities behind most alts. 
What you're seeing is very un-bitcoin like centralized manipulation by idiots like Roger Ver and Jihan looking after their own interests. 
Scaling through bigger blocks is not efficient at all. I don't want to store every single micro-transaction in the blockchain forever.
Its already a fairly hefty ask to run a node as it is.

If it survives the next few years and gets to 40k per coin... It's going to be around for a long time. If it collapsed from that height, so many people would give up on crypto after being burned so hard. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:49:12
You're implying that a dollar or two would put people off selling their Bitcoin?
Fees have been higher, fees have been lower... it doesn't bother me much. The majority of people buy once, send to a wallet and HODL.

Pretty sad to see them kill the goose that lays the golden egg. 
If this knocks bitcoin down, the whole of crypto will be damaged. 
Longer term an alt (not bitcash) will win... And Bitcoin miners hardware could be obsolete. 
Hopefully this is just temporary until Btcash difficulty raises. 
I'm not selling!

@_date: 2017-08-17 09:21:27
You're implying that those of us who didn't sell when the price was stagnant or tanking "were not smart". 
Also, it's more of a commodity than a currency... And will continue to be so until the price is much higher. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:35:28
But you need to open payment channels to get on the LN don't you? They are basically the same thing? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:43:39
Pretty easy to game though... just send coins back and forth. What exactly are they spending it on if nobody accepts it?
If its for testing smart contracts its not really a like for like comparison.

Where are you looking?
This was at 80/20 in favor of BCH yesterday 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:08:54
Have you played with the eclair wallet beta yet? I was sceptical of the LN until yesterday. Once a channel is open, you can do instant transfers for tiny or free cost. When LN is live it's going to blow every other coin out of the water. It also means sidechains can be employed for things like anonymity or smart contracts. 
Just increasing the blocksize seems massively short sighted and inefficient. 
It just doesn't make sense to store every single tiny coffee purchase for eternity on every copy of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:12:04
Any idea when this will be? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:34:13
They absolutely do, two of my friends want to buy Bitcoin because the price is "too high". 0.02 of a Bitcoin seems like nothing. 
2000000 Bits would make them feel like they have got something for their money. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:21:48
Fair enough. I guess there's two possibilities for bitcoin though. Either it is, as you think... A giant ponzi scheme. Or, it's an emerging, non correlated scarce asset class (digital gold). Honestly? It could be either... But I'm more on the side of the later. Mainstream financial news seems to be seeing it the same way. 
I think if the stock market drops a percent or two tomorrow, and headlines of 4k hit the financial press... You could be bleeding heavily from your short. Just my non professional opinion. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:07:44
The fees now, really don't bother most people. They buy Bitcoin in the hopes its going up in value. Its more like a commodity than a currency.
I could fork Bitcoins codebase and have lower on chain fees. It doesn't matter if the infrastructure and mind share isn't there. 
The recent pump in BTCash is clearly manipulation and traders setting up to make a ton of cash. 
Seen it before with other coins. 
Sure, BCH could incorporate those things... but why? The whole reason for splitting it off was because they don't want side chains!! 
Bigger and Bigger blocks and stupid 10 minute plus confirmation times forever is not cool anymore. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:54:12
You realize that most of us haven't been bothered to split our Bitcash from our real Bitcoin yet don't you?
Its pretty obvious from recent price action that Bitcoin is far from death. 
Pretty sure the only way is down for BCH.

Bitcoin bringing the real fire and fury! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:23:10
Maybe, maybe not. Millennials are far more comfortable assigning value to digital items. 
To me bitcoin is gold 2.0.
Its actually better than gold... Easily divisible, cheap to store and you can walk across a border with 1 million dollars in your head. 
Gold is ancient tech in comparison. 
You would be crazy to want to spend something that might be worth more next month... That's why people hodl. 
It could become a useful currency, but the price has to be much much higher. At the moment it's fairly trivial for someone with a few million dollars to move the market. 
At 100k per coin, you would have much less volatility. 
Until then, expect numerous boom and busts... With an overall boom in the long term. 
Someone once said "money is the bubble that never bursts" 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:44:17

You're confusing lightening network with segwit.

Censorship resistant? Its actually more traceable than cash.
That's why I got myself some Monero!
 
Perhaps people would still find it valuable, and its doubtful it would be banned in all countries. It would just be severely hamstrung if most people could only buy or sell it by swapping cash in person. 
I think 90%+ of people don't really care about spending Bitcoin, or censorship though. Its purely a speculative gamble and trading device (at the moment at least). 
Maybe it will be a way for me to 'hide' wealth in the future... but again, that's a reason for governments and banks to clamp down.

But what do you call an 'opportunity'? A market crash?
Market timing has been pretty much proven to be impossible... and even the worlds worst investor usually makes money!
Try the market timing game:
And... Bob, the worlds worst investor:
Just ran some figures... the S&amp;P since 2000 with dividends reinvested would give you 2.83% over inflation.
OK... that's not amazing, but its also less than the long term average, meaning the next 18 years could be epic for our generation. (if you're the same age as me)


In that case, we've lucked out and are now on a slow and steady decline for the rest of our lives and all that technological progress and growth in the worlds labor force wont amount to any more economic advancement.
Well if those are our cards, then so be it. Still no excuse to hold on to cash hoping to catch the bottom of the next crash... which could be a decade from now. 
Also.. should a crash come, its quite possible you'll be too worried to invest, preferring to hold on to your 'safe' cash. Then miss the opportunity thinking the world is going to end.  
I hear you on keeping some dry powder, I do that. But you really should invest the bulk of your free liquid assets. 
And spread your risk! There is a massive tendency to stick with home markets. My global funds went up 20% last year when my country voted for Brexit!!!
If I had been out of the market for even a couple of days I wouldn't got that 'opportunity'

@_date: 2017-08-25 20:29:17
Yea, I started in 2012 too... and made my initial bet back after a few months so I'm playing with house money. 
Honestly, I'm amazed its got to 4k... so I suppose 10k is possible. 
You just weigh it as more likely that I do. Fair enough. 
I don't give it 90% as it would be fairly trivial for Government or Banks to cut off the on-ramps at exchanges. 
Some banks in the UK already dont allow you to send money to bitcoin exchanges... and US based exchanges are having trouble. 
Crypto would die pretty quickly if that happened.

2013/14. The second big bubble. This is the third... 
Annoyingly, I read a tweet when it s posted that said China had banned bitcoin... So I sold my coins. The market dipped a little then recovered, so I bought back in... Then it tanked hard and went downward for more than a year.

@_date: 2017-08-25 18:43:07
OK, well I did a similar thing with Monero recently... I thought it was due for a good uptick. 
However, I very much see crypto as secondary to my investments. In fact, I dont see them as investments at all. 
I see crypto as a speculative gamble. I've lived through 2 massive bullruns and bubble pops. Brutal 80% drops... for all we know we are in the middle of another one. 
Its fairly easy to make money when the whole of the cryptoverse is rising for 12 months! 
Sure, crypto could be much higher in 5 years... it could equally be much, much lower in 1 month. 
That's gambling, not investing. You're not buying the right to a dividend... you are buying, hoping another guy will pay more than you when you sell. 
I would bet that the vast majority of altcoins wont even be on the map in a couple of years. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:59:10
Bitcoin is up 5% in the last 24 hours and 9% in the last 7 days. 
Is that not fast enough for you!???
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:48:24
Roughly how long until fees start coming down? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:45:39
But what difference would it make even if such research was possible?
If they found out that say 80% of coins were 'lost'... that just means Bitcoin is more scarce than thought (price goes up).
If it was found that only 10% were lost (less than most would assume)... so what? the price is what it is with those 10% lost. 
My point is, the lost coins... no matter how many of them there are, are priced in. 
The satoshi coins thing is troubling as it means, no matter how big this gets... if that moves, the whole thing comes crashing down. 
I wish the coins were sent to a black hole account... meaning they cant be spent. 
You do have to wonder why Satoshi (or the group who made Bitcoin) would do that though... its their baby. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 10:38:26
So you're pretty heavily in the red right now? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:09:39
I will. By using this to buy a coffee it's fairly obvious that this isn't exactly frictionless (for the first time at least). Seems like a hassle to open a channel, then after a few verifications you can send bitcoin with a second transaction . It's two steps instead of one. 
Fine for places you shop at regularly, but for one offs it's just more hassle. 
People are either going to be lazy and continue to use the main chain or end up with a load of open channels tying up bitcoin. 
What happens if I open 50 channels on my mobile wallet tying up 2 bitcoins... Then lose my phone? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:21:12

It would be impossible to determine. If I had a stash which I had in a cold wallet from 2012, how on earth would you ever know if it was accessible or not. You would need a survey to all Bitcoin users, asking them to truthfully tell you if they still hold the private keys to the millions of stashes out there.

If you think Crypto has a small downside risk you are absolutely insane! Bitcoin has dropped 80% in a single day... in fact I think it had a flash crash of around that in 2014.
Litecoin has no real fundamentals... its all tied to Bitcoin. 
Again, betting is fun... but you can lose just as easily as gain. 
And it really shouldn't be seen as any sort of replacement to time tested stocks and shares for wealth generation. 
Ironic considering my crypto has made me waaaay more than my investment portfolio. But I really do think its 50/50 if I actually ever see my crypto paper gains in real money.

A huge dip is basically guaranteed. Have you not zoomed out on the bitcoin charts to see whats happened before?
The quandary you have, is that we don't know how far further this bull run has to go. Might never drop below 3600 ever again... might dip to sub 2000. 
Why did you buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:08:09
We're here for the long game. 
Bitcoin wont be very good as a currency until the price stabilizes (at a much higher market cap). 
By then basic transactions will be via sidechains. 
I don't mind paying occasionally to move my digital gold. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:48:33
Yea, It kind of sucks for some people I guess. Its the price you pay for being on the coin with the most long term potential though.
If someone was going to sell Bitcoin I imagine they would be selling considerably more than $40 though. If I was selling 1 BTC a $4 fee would not change my mind.

I'm not going to donate to these guys if I perceive the app to be reducing in quality. Not long ago they introduced adverts which is something I don't want on a bitcoin wallet as it could be an attack vector. 
I have said I would pay for the fucking app.. If the payment reduced the shit they're adding. 
They absolutely should be rewarded for making a good product. I'm not going to reward them for making the product progressively worse.

It's a pretty shit currency as it's so volatile. It's more of a commodity like gold. Could it be a decent currency? Maybe one day... But the value has to be much higher. If it's crazy expensive, it costs too much for traders to force swings all the time. 
Not many people want to spend bitcoin as it could be worth more tomorrow, and it's a pain in the ass to buy more.

Don't beat yourself up too much. Lots of people on here once owned hundreds or even thousands of coins once. Just think... Every single coin tells a story of multiple owners who got rid of it once when it was $1, $10, $100, $1000... Etc. 
People sold not that long ago at $2000. When you make your decisions *think *about it... Then live with it. It also works in reverse... You may regret buying bitcoin at these prices (maybe not). Then in ten years, you may wish you bought more at these prices! It's crazy.

By the way, anyone with eyes can see that bitcoin bubbles up and pops. It's happened a few times. The problem is, you don't know how far into this bubble we are. There are big players (far bigger than you) who could be about to school you for shorting.

@_date: 2017-08-12 11:40:10
You cant really compare it to stocks. You need to know how many shares there are so you know what the EPS is.. and from that figure out if the price is worth the dividend you will receive. 
There is no dividend in Bitcoin... you know the price, and you know the inflation, and that's all you need. 
We will never know how many of those 16 million have been lost... literally no way to tell. The coins sat in a lost account look identical to coins sat idle and someone has the private keys. 
The only scenario I could see as causing a massive correction, is if say... some of Satoshi's stash started moving!

@_date: 2017-08-19 11:38:47
People want instant, low or zero fee transactions. 
People want smart contracts. 
People want anonymous transactions. 
Btcash doesn't offer those. But BTC with LN does. You don't have to use them. 
Btcash might scale... For a bit. Saving every single tiny coffee purchase for eternity is not efficient though. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:19:30
That's what I thought when I first read about LN. Turns out that you don't need to open thousands of channels. Say you're buying a coffee from a coffee shop... They just need to have a channel open with the same (equivalent) as bit pay and you can instantly transact with them. Fees will be tiny if any. 
And da fuq I would do if mining power flip flops from the original bitcoin to a copy? Either leave crypto entirely or switch to ethereum maybe? They should have an equivalent of the LN shortly... Any crypto that doesn't is going to be ancient tech soon. 
They make plenty of money at the moment...and i imagine they will continue to do so when bitcoin is 20k.
Fickle miners would just undermine the entire brand of Bitcoin. I'm not worried though, Bitcoin has beaten lots of attacks like that.

So to answer your question, there's nothing wrong with doing what you are trying to do. Just sell and see what happens... maybe you win, maybe you lose. 
The fact that you are even asking the question tells me that you are someone who could get burnt though.

Ok. What's your point? The need to open a channel just to access the LN and pay someone isn't inconvenient? 
Why would I choose to do that, instead of just pay them with bitcoin on the main chain directly? 
For one off payments, it's a 3 step process! Open channel (wait) send bitcoin, close channel.

Well fair enough, I hope it works out for us both. I'm more interested in how much money I can make rather than banking the unbanked if I'm honest. Even if this system replaced the current one, you'd just replace the current wealthy elite with a new wealthy elite. Nothing would change.
Some banks in the UK already stop you sending or receiving money from exchanges. So, it is fairly easy to hurt bitcoin pretty badly, if worldwide banks want to go that route, or if Bitcoin becomes more than the speculative fad it is. It's for a chance, but I'm not going all in like lots of noob clowns see to be doing. Each bitcoin bubble seems to enrich those who bought in a previous bubble. I do know that their are a lot of nervous bitcoin "paper" millionaires right now whose belief in Bitcoin gets tested on every correction.

@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:04
I'm not either side. Just try to see it from their side though.. They are fed up with the fees and believe bitcoin should be how it's always been. They are not scamming anyone... They just have a different view to you. Saying that, I would prefer btc to win.
Its all football teams mate... Just because someone supports another team doesn't mean they're wrong.

Oh sorry, I misread. But I'm pretty sure you both need Segwit addresses for a Segwit transaction to happen?
Some guy told me that yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:52:06
Makes very little sense if you understand that 1gb + future blocks (under very conservative future use cases)... is a pretty dumb, inefficient and centralized scaling solution destined to fail. 
In 5 years, if I'm spending 100 separate satoshis on youtube videos donations a day, does it really make sense to store those 100 transactions in a massive blockchain replicated throughout the world for eternity? 
Off chain is the only way to go. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:51:31
OK mate, that sucks. I don't know what country you're in... but don't beat yourself up too much. 0.31905 BTC isn't *that* much money really. I know its not a tint amount... but honestly, you were never going to get rich with Bitcoin. Imagine how those people who lost 100's of Bitcoin when MtGox went under feel today.
If you aren't going to buy back in, best you can do is move on and unsubscribe. Just forget about it all.... there's way more to life than money my friend.

There is a lot of research showing that low cost tracker funds certainly aren't for suckers. 
This Cuban guy is talking shit too... how can holding cash be a good idea if its losing 3% in purchasing power each year due to inflation?
Over decades the stock market has risen by (circa) 7% (after inflation) for over 100 years. Sure there are ups and downs, but if your time horizon is long enough I cant think of a better investment. 
Sure Crypto has been on a roll for the last 2 years... but it is VERY risky. 
You have said yourself that in the last 18 years the markets have 'only' gone up 65%... (it may be more). But that has to be better than losing 3% each year?
And we have seen 2 major crashes in that time... yet markets are at ATH's.
Dont write off the stock market because of your patents experience. They quite possibly had bad advice and bought expensive managed funds. 
Diversification for most people is absolutely the best thing to do. Sure some guys can pick good stocks and beat the markets... but its mostly survivorship bias. Someone had to.

@_date: 2017-11-11 06:09:27
Yes, but wishing something was true doesn't make it so. If you want it to be a good currency, hard fork it so it has inflation. People don't want to spend a deflationary currency.

Yes, you can find other banks... my point is, if they ever see Bitcoin as a legitimate threat, and not a speculative bubble. Its fairly easy to crush. Unless you want to buy Bitcoin by swapping amazon vouchers for it or something.

Sure *on average* he could get 7% if he went for an index fund or something... but that has risk. The stock market crashes every now and then (2000, 2008). Lots of people think its over valued now.

ok man, out of curiosity... have you seen how Bitcoin performed in previous cycles? 2013 / 2014? I'm not saying they will repeat, but some of us had to HODL during long bear markets. Its not easy, especially if its debt you're holding on the other side.

Nothing? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:29:25
To do a segwit transaction you have to move your coins to a segwit address and the person you're sending too has to have a segwit address. I'd convert mine if the fees weren't so high.

Well it's not really a scam if the coins were free. I'm pretty agnostic these days about crypto. Bch sure would fix the ridiculous fees situation, but I don't think it would do any good for it to be the new bitcoin. (press would slaughter us).
Saying that, I don't trust this rally much.

This. 
Are miners really so stupid as to kill the goose which lays the golden egg?
Mainstream media would crucify Bitcoin if it can just be taken over by force... the miners and a couple of businesses are going against the wishes of the community.
I think Bitcoin will prevail though, and be worth more after showing yet another attack vector that doesn't work. 
X2 has one developer! That is not something that can hold billions of value.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:31:18
Lots of people had hundreds in 2012 /13 and did similar.
Well, basically most coins in existence have sad stories of people who regret selling them. 
Instead of beating yourself up, try to view it as gambling... Its like deciding to fold at poker, then they flip over the cards and it *would* have been the perfect hand for you. Could have just as easily been a terrible hand. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:31:16
OK, surely you have some patience to see how far Segwit can take us first? Its only at about 10% adoption!
If its not sufficient, I'll back you for a small increase in blocksize. Right now, keeping the chain as small as possible and not allowing a hostile mining takeover are my primary concerns. 
Which is what this is ultimately about. Bitcoin needs to be a system which cant be taken over by a back room deal between miners and suits. 
Do you honestly think the core devs don't have Bitcoins best interests at heart? They are far more invested in this that you or I. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:26:07
I want to use segwit, but the fees to move from my wallet make that a non starter.

They don't 'control' it... they are a diverse group of very talented devs who most users trust with the future direction of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-10 11:57:11
Exactly. It's also traders capitalising on your fear. I'm selling bch slowly at these levels
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:47:41
Well if they don't like it, it's fairly trivial to kill it now. A few billion short on the futures exchange for example. My funds have been stuck on bitstamp since last weekend because of kyc regulations. All banks have to do is ban you from sending Fiat to or from bitcoin exchanges.
Do you think the vast majority of people care about changing the system? Or are they like me (and probably you) who would prefer to make a ton of money?
If it's the latter, this is a text book speculative bubble yet again. Tulips,. Com bubble... Human greed is stupid. If I had to bet right now, I think we'll get to 10k and it will tank like you won't believe.
When it tanked from 1100 there were a couple of suicides from deluded idiots who liquidated their pension pots, and put bitcoin on credit cards. That's happening again.
Sure, there's a chance bitcoin could make it... There's also good chance nobody cares, and are just euphoric looking at their blockfolio accounts thinking theyre geniuses.
That euphoric feeling can quickly change (you had a taste last week by the sounds of it). Denial, then despair as your dreams disappear.
The new car im getting is $30k... It cost me $30 in Bitcoin (which I bought a few years ago) . Not everyone can win here...someone paid for my car, and it wasn't me.
If you honestly believe in Bitcoin, I hope you don't lose faith in a 2 year long bear market like I lived through. It's brutal.

That's not really true... the last bear was 2 years. You had two bubbles in quick succession in 2013 and 14. One popped in March... then it blew up only 6-8 months or so later. 
The only problem we have now is that the press will be all over the next crash... instead of just going "meh, we new it would fail". 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:19:51
Does that include new transactions added in that time? A lot of people are going to want to get to exchanges right now.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:38:05

@_date: 2017-11-18 12:10:37
I have no regrets, bought back 70 percent of my coins at less than I sold for. Evidently I had too much on the table. Gonna buy a new car, and I can sleep at night now.
I've lived through two bitcoin bubbles, and history repeats.
You've not made money till you sell buddy... Everyone is looking at notional profits.

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:58:24
Would you drop 5k on a random alt now? Doing that back then would have been even more of a long shot. Crypto was brand new, nobody knew this would have blown up. 
Might as well get pissed at youself for not buying Tesla stock.
There is also basically zero chance you would have held until today. Lots cashed out at $1 or $10. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:39:05
Its not really just like the others, its 'tethered' 1:1 to dollars (which may prove to be illegal). 
Also, they do have a lot to do with bitcoin, as a ton of Bitcoin is bought with tethers. Have any audits been done to know that the tethers are actually backed by dollars? Not saying it is, but tethers could have been issued out of thin air to inflate the Bitcoin price. 
If the Government crack down on Tether, you can be sure it would not have zero effect on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:58:01
I know that... it just doesn't make much sense to send my coins to a Segwit address first. I double up on fees
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:12:48
I have yet to see any real support for x2, not on Reddit, not on Twitter... anywhere. Sure a few miners are signaling it, but that doesn't mean much. They follow the money. 
I think we'll see some turbulence around the fork, then a massive upswing in Bitcoin as years of 'debate' would be over. 
Bitcoin suceeds in beating, two attacks.. that adds to the value for me. If Bitcoin loses... I'm out of crypto for good. Whats the point, if a few miners and suits can undermine a currency?
The project will fail... and pretty sure the whole crypto space will dive. 
I'm happy for your trade... I'm not fussed about making a few more Bitcoins through trading though. I could easily be out of Bitcoin for the next big move... not going to take that risk. 
My view is that its just traders capitalizing on current fears. That can change rapidly. 
It is Bitcoin which is all over the news, and about to have futures... not BCH or a sham copy, one dev x2 clone. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:59:16
They only want x2 to damage Bitcoin so they have a better chance. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:14:37


Well thats open to debate. Deflationary currencies are crap... everyone HODL's as its stupid to buy stuff if you can buy more with your money next week. An economy run on Bitcoin would be absolutely terrible... that's why we came off the Gold standard. 
If you have no control over money supply, you cant inflate out of depressions / recessions or slow things down when you need to. SO you get boom and busts... which is exactly what we see, time and time again (2011, 2013, 2014) with Bitcoin. Its completely crap as a currency. 
The price of Gold may have gone up, but it was mostly Roosevelts doing. The Government were HODLing, not the people.

You think another bull run would happen if the price dropped from 7888 to 5000? Nope... hype cycles can reverse. Can you imagine the media if it hits 5000? Bitcoin crashed! less buyers, price reduces, more bad headlines. I'm not saying it wont be 20k in 2 years, I'm saying it could go way lower than 5000.
The maturity of the market is irrelevant, if everyone here is hoping to sell their coins to someone else at a higher price.

I missed the post about 120k nodes... what was it about. 
Just setting up my own node too :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:06:26
Nope... since 2012. Seen it tank brutally twice. Could easily go back to previous ATH $1100 if it follows the last pop. 
Are you new?

How do you know it's the bottom? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:32:00
The CME hasn't been given the green light. Its futures also, just as easy to short as to go long. 
The fact that transactions take 24 hours and cost a fortune will not bode well come the press onslaught and talk of the bubble popping. This is already deeper and faster than the previous "corrections" 
Just look around, everyone is panicking. Soon to be 200k unconfirmed transactions which will take ages to clear even if the miners come back with full hash power, which isn't guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:53:18
Ok, Mr teacher... How big will the bch blockchain be if it reaches visa transaction levels. How about 10x that due to micropayments? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:31
He didn't do anything wrong. If you held millions worth of Bitcoin you would sell. With the amount of liquidity here, it wouldn't have dented the price much. 
The price is crashing because people are selling. You cant blame a single guy for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:45:47
Absolutely, it's basically free money if you buy in Sunday and sell on Monday.
Well done on figuring it out.
I can't believe highly educated professional traders missed this opportunity! Guaranteed money baby! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:48
That doesnt make much sense... why would he want to create fear so the value of his coins drops?
Why wouldn't he sell Bitcoin? He sees it as an alt
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:10:24
Might want to hang fire there fellow Brit, until the market decides if it bear market time or not. 
Yea, that would work... I'm cashing out through FIRE to Revolut so I get a better exchange rate. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:55:30
Maybe, you'd have only just now recovered from 2000 bubble if you'd invested in the nasdaq.
The Nikkei hasn't recovered from 1989.
My point is that houses offer more than just monetary gain. They offer piece of mind.
I'm far less concerned about my house value crashing than my portfolio.
Markets could do what the Nikkei did...who knows what the outcome is QE and tiny interest rates will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:25:59
Who is the enemy? Its Bitcoiners selling, not some enemy you have in your head. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:35:00
Or all those unconfirmed transactions are people trying to get to an exchange to sell. This exchange is flooded right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:22:05
Is there a limit to how much money you can deposit in either fire or revolut?

If x2 becomes the 'new' Bitcoin, the whole crypto economy will crash hard. Whats the point in being no.1 if a group of people can take control?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:06:59
Well, I sold my bitcoin above 7k... thinned my bch. Now I'm mostly Fiat. With a few cheaper btc I'm holding to ride this bull trap a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:56:28
Me too... my email account says I have 0.25 BTC in there! aghhhhh!
That was like two mobile phones ago. Do you think emailing them and telling them everything I know about the account would help?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:06:12
Nice pumping 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:20:29
I would if I thought doing that might gain me *more* profit in the future, or if I genuinely felt that the coin had been taken over by someone. 
If they did keep mining BCH, there would be a big swing to BCH in terms of price I think as BTC is more likely to die. 
I'm a core supporter before you go bashing me!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:46:26
You're cheering as the market goes down?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:25:39
Someone with weak hands doesn't want the price to go up anymore! ha 
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:35:25
I feel old
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:49:38
You probably wouldn't ... 2015 was after two almighty crashes. Nobody knew if Bitcoin was just a stupid fad which was going down in value all the time. You would have been buying and seeing your 'investment' reduce in value. 
You would also have to HODL through some pretty scary moments. FLippening, Cashening, huge exchange hacks etc. Not easy to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:42:02
Yep, I'd be selling that. wow
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:34:02
Spent it all on cars and Women... the rest he wasted :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:06
Just relax mate, seriously... you become immune to this shit eventually. You dont just launch that far into 10k and beyond in a few hours without a big pullback. Basically traders making money from the FOMO noobs. 
The take home is that 11k has been established now... it becomes easier to get there (and beyond) on the next push. 
TLDR...Don't panic! Or you end up losing. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:26:50
You got it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:06:53
Yea, I'm sure they just leave their money in something like this over the weekend and wait till monday to trade! ha
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:56:34
You did well to hold that through both 2013 and 2014...my hands were not that strong!
I'm salty I didn't buy first round eth. I had the god damn email asking me to invest 1BTC. Some genius on here convinced me that it was too inflationary. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:46:30
Thanks for what? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:44:31
Thats what is so fascinating about this experiment. I've witnessed pure human nature over the years... communities splitting over seemingly minor disputes. Then those divides growing deeper. Heros and Villains are born. Its a great microcosm for humanity!
Humans are stupid animals!

If it's a commodity, it could go up in value as Gold did in the last recession. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:16:40
Yes. It can't scale long term and doesn't have Segwit or LN coming
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:13:51
That's not that long
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:42:19
You know there is another option to the price increasing?
What on earth makes you think people would prefer bitcoin to regular currency?
It just cost me £20 to send £100. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:58:42
OK, if you denominate value in Bitcoin sure. He did say dollar cost average. 
I probably shouldn't blindly assume that he's here to make profit. 
He may prefer Bitcoins to dollars. You are correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:43:40
Its just human nature, people keep making the same mistakes over and over. Always have, always will.

Good for you, you're adding liquidity to the market. It's not something the majority of noobs should be doing though
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:56:09
I'm looking at mycillium right now.. to send 100 gbp it costs 22 gbp on normal. Thats 677 sat/byte. 
If unconfirmed transactions and panic keep growing it will soon be pointless to even send it! ha

Fair enough mate

Any actual data to back that up?
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:14:53
I have no idea, there's no replay protection so lots of people are going to be too scared to move coins at all. That's why this dumb now could drop the entire market.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:20:41
? Like I said... Short it then. Nothing is guaranteed.
Oooh $70 off 7000, on a downtrend and you are placing a bet. You're so brave.
I don't like those odds thanks. I'm just saying that nothing is guaranteed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:58:28
Fair enough. I cant believe trading view doesn't show the previous bubbles! Google them, they look pretty much identical (apart from the values obviously)
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:01:43
Doubtful... imagine how strong your hands would have had to be to go though all of the previous bubbles without selling. 
(These are rough figures as I cant be bothered to research the actual ATHs and crashes...
2011 $25 back to $2 ... he would have seen 42k turn to 3.4k
2013 $260 back to $75 ... he would have seen 442k turn to 127k
2014 $1100 back to $174 ... he would have seen 1.87million turn to  212k a year later. 
The guy would have been a nervous wreck. The fact that he sold them when he did, means there is no way he would have HODLD.
Only true believers, the already rich, or those who forgot about owning some have made millions. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:38:31
Seriously? So if you don't take regular stocks off an exchange you can buy and sell all you like with no tax implications?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:05:03
I'll give it a go! Cheers
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:26:07
If lots of people are sending Bitcoin it doesn't help. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:35:27
And people are attacking Bitcoin by selling it to make money!
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:25
You're assuming we're still not crashing. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:34:23
Perhaps they think that paying $15 to send $100 is not that great?
I prefer BTC, but I think both sides have fucked this up.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:52:17
Dont need to send $15million to make a point like that.
He's doing exactly what I would be doing if I were sat on that sort of value... getting out

What's so special about 7k? What about those people who have shorted? They need it lower
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:40
We've all been there. If you sell, you end up panic buying back in, possibly at a higher cost! (maybe even a tax liability)
This could drop further... but you'll see. There will be a pretty violent move upward at some point. 
If you want to Hold Bitcoin... just hold Bitcoin. Its not rocket science.

I'm not in either anymore... But at least they can move their coins right now
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:34:14
You're basing normal behaviour on very recent trends. Look at 2013 and 2014 for normal behaviour. Actually look at any speculative bubble. Could drop to the previous ath. That's $1100.
I know, I know..." This time it's different".
You don't think it's a little cultish to keep hearing "buy the dip" just hodl... And have people messaging you to chastise you for selling and gloat about their paper profits? I've seen it before

Nothing wrong with diversification.

@_date: 2017-11-12 02:36:47
I mean, fair play... You do have some points there. No doubt about it. But I bet I've seen a better return this year than you have trader boy :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:40:24
Yes, but in their eyes they have the original Bitcoin... and it may be justified by the fact that you can hardly use Bitcoin at the moment. 
Its a fork so it is essentially the same coin, YOU have just decided it which is Bitcoin. (and the market, by assigning it a higher price). 
I have skin on both coins... but out of curiosity, why is that one a shitcoin in your eyes?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:04
No... unreachable..
Do I have to port forward 8333 or something?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:30:42
Its also for "painting the tape" ... lots of tiny green buys gives the illusion that there is buying pressure. Its a manipulation, illegal in regulated markets I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:12:44
It's just not been economical to date. Better to suck up the fees once, than twice. I'm also not comfortable batching all my bitcoin into one transaction 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:31:29
What's your exit strategy? You bought back in.
People had exit strategies back when the price was $10...I did regrettably. There weren't Bitcoin futures in the pipeline then.
The whole bitcoin thing is starting to look like something so crazy, it might just work. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:37:32
Without doubt its a few deep pocket guys / groups doing that. They push through walls and certain price points... noobs rush in to push it higher, they dump onto the noobs, rake some profits. Rinse, repeat. 
Works on the way down too... fake a recovery, dump. Buy low again, fake a recovery, dump. 
They are needed though. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:43:04
Pretty evil isn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:57
Its hard to have an end price when people just say moon. 
I exited yesterday for what its worth. I realized this wont be making me a millionare.  I think I would have a heart attack if I had 1 million in something like this!
6 years of fun and I have kept a few... its been emotional. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:43:46
In the scenario you describe you would liquidate your Bitcoin at you're average purchase price (assuming no slippage)... and have a net profit of zero. 
Then your buy order would execute (if Bitcoin got that low) and you would hold Bitcoin again. Your profit at that time would be zero... and future profit would depend on the direction that Bitcoin travels after your reentry. You also need to factor in exchange fees for buys and sells. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:27:07
Sold 75% yesterday... I'm not riding out another 2 year bear market fully exposed!
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:58:27
I don't think the miners simply created BCH to make a quick buck. They preferred larger blocks... simple as that. 
They now just mine whichever chain is more profitable... if they were trying to kill Bitcoin they would not be mining it right now. 
Also, its not in their best interests long term to kill the value of Bitcoin. Dont point your frustrations at them.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:48:17
You're Buying Bitcoin on a credit card?
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:12:14
Exactly, as much as I respect him... You can't just blindly follow it like a bible. How could he have known that Chinese miners would have a monopoly? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:46:45
You'll have to link me to that... I cant find it. 
Bitfinex has it closer to $1000. All pretty irrelevant at this stage... BCH had high "support" too. Just traders doing their thing. 
I'm hoping bch pumps even higher too actually as I've just split off my coins. Free Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:59:06
That's dumb thinking. Are you going to kick yourself for not buying more today if the price triples? Do you kick yourself for not choosing the correct lottery numbers?

Could be tomorrow at this rate

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:53:59
Maybe, depends if panic continues to escalate. You've also damaged confidence in Bitcoin. Who want to hold millions in this thing, if you cant cash out during a panic?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:23:35
I think you know the answer
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:44:41
Unless miners prefer BCH and decide to keep hashing power on BCH
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:33:02
Lol, in what sense? You can't see the risk here?

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:17
Yea sure a country could do this. The US banned Gold once.
A country could easily ban banks from allowing you to send money to Bitcoin exchanges. Banning Bitcoin (maths) is actually much harder though.  
However, there are a lot of countries in the World. 
And some have already stated that it is legal. 
If you're looking for a risk free asset... this isn't it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:08:38
What do you consider low? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:07:26
You're not actually holding bitcoin then? Just betting on a CFD? Wow
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:55:29
5k is still in this bubble... I mean previous bubbles. I missed the one in 2011, I lived through the one in 2013 and 2014. They all returned to the high of the previous bubble. Which was the 2014 bubble which topped out at 1100 then absolutely tanked.
They look small now, but at the time they were as massive as this seems (relatively) 
It doesn't take much to burst speculative bubbles...US looking into regulations etc.
Just so you know, trying to cash out is a royal pain in the ass... You get asked for proof of where you got your bitcoins, passport, earning statements etc. Banks and government hate this... And you think the big money will be buying heavily soon?
I'm not saying they won't... That's why I have kept some. But at Warren Buffet said "be fearful when others are greedy".
You can't know how many people are buying bitcoin, what if everyone is like you and don't want to sell? Eventually a price is reached which is too high and it topples harder than 30 percent.
I don't really trust reddit either, this is heavily moderated and the voting system sifts out anything negative. Not a great place to base your investment strategy on.
And I've not even talked about tethers and bitfinex magically paying back the millions they had stolen. You think the US government are going to take kindly to someone basically counterfeiting US dollars digitally?
I mean, how do you think this will play out? We all get rich?! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:36:06

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:12:38
If hes not not moving his bitcoin to an exchange for cash... theres another big bch pump incoming then
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:50:20
Of course I've followed those events. I've been here since 2012.
It doesn't take 80bn of investment to raise the market cap to 80bn. The market cap is just the last price paid for a bitcoin x the theoretical number of Bitcoins there are. There's not 80bn of actual money anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:35:19
Greed... such a lovely side of humanity :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:00:50
And that is why we HODL my friend
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:31:16
The general rule is that anyone who has HODLd at any point in the last decade has not regretted it. Selling Bitcoin rarely pays off in the long term. People will still try to do so though... panic is a bitch. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:12:25
A number of banks disallow sending money to exchanges in the UK. And lots of people have had their accounts frozen for receiving money from an exchange. Im currently trying to get funds off an exchange and it's a pain in the fucking ass with all the kyc.
So yea, fairly trivial if they all adopt the same policy. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:55:14
I'm guessing you are pretty new here? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:53:21

@_date: 2017-11-06 21:23:01
Bitcoin... so stable. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:58:05
Yea, but I might as well keep them in a legacy address until the fees come down
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:31:09
Because the mempool is 120k and transactions aren't clearing, and fees are massive. 
This causes panic and bad sentiment. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:38:48
Ok, I'll ignore
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:01
Pretty sure both sides have fucked each other. I didn't want s2x... but a 2mb block was a reasonable compromise. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:35:48
They can't "get" taxes from you regardless... You have to legally declare them. Most exchanges hold your passport so tax authorities will possibly be aware of any tax events.
In the UK, in pretty sure you're liable for tax the second you sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:07:43
How do you know it's improved? They messed it up last time... Could be worse, and / or less profitable for miners to milk.

@_date: 2017-11-12 09:32:25
"you should do the same".
You can't know things will get better anytime soon... I'm guessing this is your first bitcoin bubble? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:09:00
OK, but crypto would be set back years I imagine.... and none of the current gen coins would be the successor to Bitcoin in my opinion. 
Pretty sure Bitcoins network effect, brand name and track record (nearly 9 years of being attacked from all angles) will ensure it remains no.1. 
Not really looked into vertcoin... but I just sold off my Monero. Interesting project, but sidechains will be able to add anonymity to the most liquid and popular crypto. I got bored waiting for development of wallets, its also a pain in the ass to actually use. 
The true strength of Bitcoin isnt even anything to do with technicalities or politics.... its liquidity. Thats all the big money cares about. If you are buying a big position, you need to know the liquidity is there to get out. Thats where Bitcoin is heads and shoulders above the rest. Can you really see monero futures any time soon? Bitcoin is miles ahead, and it will, once again, show how strong it is when x2 fails miserably.  
 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:14:06
Then why do they choose the exact same time? It's big investors buying through sell walls to reduce slippage.
It also generates buzz, and FOMO.
They do it to make money trading
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:28:46
Jesus, I hope that price sticks when I dump x2.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:00:56
Its not really good, If you are sending Bitcoins to an exchange and they get stuck for 24 hours it doesnt make you feel good. You panic, which is what causes the price to drop. 
Then the press pick up on all of this, and the ridiculous fees, and the negative feedback look continues. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:39:10
Seriously? The guys at ledger have pushed out segwit, yet you're saying they have the fee estimation wrong? One cost be £16.50 yesterday! It's getting ridiculous
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:57:17
If only people could move their coins
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:50:08
Yea, you could almost think that people should use Segwit more than they are.

@_date: 2017-11-12 10:37:03
Sure, hes probably just changing wallets for shits and giggles
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:24:15
I guess the problem is, your villain is not necessarily a villain. He may be a hero to others and vice versa. 
Its all a matter of perspective. 
Agree with them or not BCH supporters believe core should have allowed bigger blocks. (I'm not arguing either way). So to them, Core are the bad actors. But you may see things differently. 
You cant go Doxing people based on an opinion. 
Who are you to judge?
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:55:52
Ugh, no... It dropped from 1100 to 200 once. This could drop back to 1100 (previous ath) 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:01:09

You won't be getting anything off me though mate. I have been praying this goes up since 2012 :)
Do all traders gloat when lots of people lose money on something? Seems a bit sick. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:38:05
Yea, you borrow it. Don't try it unless you know what you're doing though... with something as volatile as Bitcoin, you can find yourself heavily under water in minutes.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:45:24
Pretty much. Or they legitimately want to own bitcoin so they buy into a wall to ensure they get a certain price... No slippage. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:53:44
Really? Because most people don't actually care about Bitcoins original goal. They just want to make money. Pretty sure I would sell 80% of my coins asap. 
Whats the point of owning something you cant swap back for cash? Its pretty useless for buying things, and I have no intention of moving countries.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:15:36
Nope. It was too replace banks. 99 percent of people buy it to make money though.
Evident by the fact that we are now celebrating the banks and institutional money coming in, instead of competing with them. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:51:23
Perhaps they don't want bch, they just to go move to a Fiat exchange? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:21:08
Never mix money with friends. Say Bitcoin dropped (I'm not saying it will)... it would strain your friendship.

Why would they buy it, they get it from mining and fees?
Also, what are you basing that on? How can you know they were buying it? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:34:25
No idea how they would have any claim of the Gox coins. As far as I'm aware the only coins they seized were from the SR. And they sold them in auction. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:38:02
You're recommending someone without much money puts it all into a massively speculative thing like bitcoin? Have you gone "all in"? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:12:23
A lot of Gen xers are already on the property ladder, and some even received inheritances already. They were also the early adopters of Bitcoin. I graduated at the turn of the century and have paid off my (relatively) small student loans already. I didn't even have tuition fees. 
I do feel a bit sorry for Gen Y / Millenials to be honest. The last decade has been a bit shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:13:02
Fees now clearly don't matter. We're playing the long game. How big world bch blockchain be for visa level transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:23:15
Nice technical analysis. Have you looked at the previous 2 bubbles? 2013 and 2014?
Remarkable things have happened before... it wouldn't be without precedent to retrace back to the last ATH. Which was around $1100. 
Can you really use the word historically for such a short period of time?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:32:45
This is not investing... its speculating (at best). Pretty much gambling.

How can it be a safe haven? You get both Bitcoin and x2 if you hold Bitcoin. 
Saw a great video earlier by Andreas on why they are totally misguided thinking we can scale on chain. 
They do care about BTC cash... and that involves any tactics which might dethrone or destabilize Bitcoin... by supporting x2
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:18:38
How so, own Bitcoin, but also bet against it to a certain degree?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:47:05
So you're saying "this time its different"?
Speculative bubbles always end the same way. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:37:21
No. That's a dumb ass move. 
DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING / ABLE TO LOSE.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:43:34
I guess it hurts confidence in Bitcoins ability to be a currency. That might impact the price. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:07:49

You said you "have made more than your credit card interest rate". I'm wondering if you have cashed out your profits. i.e, I hope you're not in debt. 
Paper profits aren't real profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:00:57
You are a brave man. The general advice is not to invest more than you are willing to lose. Going into debt is (generally) very risky. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:37:27
The fact you don't know what a short is, tells me you don't know what the fuck you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:24:28
As it stands you have to spend high fees to send coins on the most secure blockchain with by far the highest network effect.
As it turns out, blockchains cant scale with bigger blocks alone. If we went that route, very quickly the blocks would become huge! 1gb, 1tb... in time, Bitcoin would fail. 
So... the very competent devs have decided to scale via methods such as Segwit, schnorr signatures, mimblewimble and second layer solutions. 
These take time to be adopted and developed. 
I appreciate that doesn't help you now if you must spend bitcoin. 
But to be honest, the vast majotity of us do not spend Bitcoin. No point in pretending otherwise. 
We are speculating on a future use case where the tech will allow near zero fees and instant transfers... but you will have to endure the short term pain of elevated fees.
There are lots of alts (which arent used much, so dont have a scaling problem) which give you low fees. You will however have to pay more for your Bitcoin should you then wish to buy some in the future. 
Just understand that Bitcoin is acting more like a commodity than a currency at the moment. If its not for you, look elsewhere. 
So to answer your question... yes, it needs more time. Rome wasn't built in a day. Be patient.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:10:23

No its not, you also have massive crashes and bear markets... just zoom out on the chart, party time this year is over in my view. 
Sure having strong hands would have paid off for us in the 2013 and 2014 crashes as Bitcoin is worth more today... but whose to say Bitcoin wont be made illegal next year if a ton of people lose (significant sums of) money again?
My "weak hands" have given me a lot of profit... I'm glad they are weak. No guarantee we could even get to 10k... and what then? Nothing goes straight up indefinitely. Its a house of cards. 
And the press can turn negative quicker than you think. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:23:53
Good for you. I've sent about 10 transactions this last week. Most are around £3 - £6. I sent a larger transaction yesterday which cost £16.50. That's choosing 'economic'.
Now I'm anti x2 and anti bch... But seriously? At the moment I can suck these up... But how do I know these fees won't double or triple?
I get that people think this is digital gold and the rising price offsets the fees, and commerce is not really driving this, but how sustainable is that? A lot of people putting 50 out 100 in a week/month are going to stop if it costs them 20 percent every time they move it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:52:03
Man, give it a rest. 'Store of value' means that (shock, horror) a deflationary currency is a dumb idea because there's a disincentive to spend. So, the market has decided that bitcoin actually has a use case as digital gold.
If that upsets you, well take it out o on the lawes of economics, not your fellow man.
One day it may be useful as a currency.. But that day is not today.

You're probably right! I bought in in 2012. I'm 75 percent out now and feeling good. I may live to regret it, but I spent a few days thinking about it, so it wasn't an emotional decision.
Cant face another bear market like the 2014 bubble pop
One comment by the US government could drop this 80 percent. The community has ripped itself apart, and fees aren't coming down anytime soon. My guess is as good as yours though really mate.

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:04:15
Its a bit harsh to call him stupid. You have to realize how niche, new and completely speculative Bitcoin was back then. I sold a load as it crashed down to that level from its height of $260 (or so). 
At the time it seemed like the most ridiculous bubble in the world. 
Exchanges were amateur, no governments had recognized Bitcoin and something you had bought only a few months before for single digits was now worth something. 
It honestly felt like Bitcoin could have gone to zero and the ride was over. 
I've flipped from losing faith, to being a believer a few times (and probably will again). It will be interesting to monitor your own emotions and beliefs when this market switches to bear mode. 
He's no more stupid than you or I for not having bought Ethereum for single digits not that long ago. We are all guessing where this will go. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:53:35
No I don't mean that. 
How do you think those people who have sent 180k transactions are feeling right now? Pised off? panicking I imagine. 
Do you think that could be a backlog of potential sellers?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:09
So its never time to FODL? Ever? 
Selling paid off for me.

How would that help? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:41:40
No need to be a complete tool. I've probably been here longer than you, and this has nothing to do with my intellect. 
I've set fees in the past... took nearly two days to go through. 
Bashing people who support Core despite this is really not the way to go.
I suspect you don't actually use bitcoin much? What happens if fees keep rising?
I chose 'economic fees' for what it's worth. If you go much lower, it takes ages to go through
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:14:26


As in getting the mining rewards for mining? The very reason they are in business?
The large number of people are largely Chinese speculators and hedge funds... making money.

How big will the blocksize be for Visa level transactions on BCH?
How many transactions per second can it handle?
If you throw around comments like yours, you should back it up. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:52:32
Lots of people are cashing out. Bitcoin is backlogged. Bch is quicker to get to exchanges... That's it
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:46:18
OK, how is that the last step before a correction?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:10:00
"as of now at least"... So you're saying that if a blocksize increase caused centralization and far fewer nodes, we could just reduce the size?

Yes it would. I'm not even that opposed to a 2mb block (though bigger blocks is clearly not a viable scaling solution). 
It would however fundamentally break Bitcoin if its direction can be dictated in a back room deal of a few miners and businesses. 
I'm fucking done with crypto if x2 wins as the project has failed in my eyes. 
Cant see it happening though.

These sad shit posts are usually made by people who panic sell all 0.2 of their bitcoin hoping others will too.
Even if we're heading for a drop, could you add a little quality to your posts. Some analysis, or basis for your opinion.

Do you mind if I ask why?
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:11:25
No they wouldn't.
 It's not cheep fees which got us here.
Network effect, mind share, quality of devs, centralization, road map for the future. Futures market, infrastructure. 
BCH is clearly controlled by miners and Ver. I'm not interested in that.
It's just a short term pump and dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:41:11
Is that a compliment, or an insult? ha
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:47:46
If you think an alt with one dev or an alt that simplistically thinks bigger blocks can work long term. You don't know what you are doing. 
If the legacy chain dies... all crypto will fall.
Selling and buying the winner seems dumb, because if you held you get given the winner. If Bitcoin is the winner, years of debate have been overcome and the price boost up might mean you end up holding considerably less than you sold. 
If you think Bitcoin is going to fail, you're better off out of the space anyway. As this whole project is doomed.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:04:37
Do you know when that kicks in?

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:36:10
Where did you get 80bn from?
I wouldn't call this "investing"... This is speculating.
Even if 80bn is correct, that could come from loads of people throwing money in each week... then more as their paper profits grow.

Good post.... thats sort of the way I see it too. Set up two teams, get them fighting to take their attention diverted. Get them emotionally and financially invested... very easy to manipulate for profit then. Apply panic, apply euphoria... get them hooked!
 
All a conspiracy maybe, or just a natural outcome from human nature and greed. 
I used to be a HODLr, but I'm not so sure anymore. I may regret my decision... I sure am taking some risk off the table though!
I dont have the emotional stability to day trade, and guessing what will bubble up next is next to impossible. Its usually something that I never expect. 
I think you also need to understand the power of social media in this too! This forum is an ideal place to spread good news, bad news and to set up heros and villains!
It is fascinating to watch!

Its comical that you have put stocks as risky, and yet not listed that as a negative of Bitcoin. This thing frequently swings 25% or so in a single day, and has tanked massively in the past (71% I think was the worst crash).
Bitcoin is many things, a non-risky store of value it is not.

Those 180k transactions are going to take quite some time to clear. Damaging confidence, I'm not so sure this is a simple correction. 
And seriously, there isn't blood on the streets. 
That was more like the massive drops in both 2013 and 2014. Bubble tend to revert to the previous all time high of the last bubble.. that was $1100. That would be blood on the streets.

Well they do want profit yea, thats why they blocked Segwit for so long. They know that bigger blocks give them more profit in the longer term, so they might use this as an opportunity to make BCH the real Bitcoin. 
I honestly prefer BTC, but I have both so I dont care. I would like to send bitcoin without having to pay fucking £22 for a small transaction though.

Nah, I'm good thanks. Fees make it a pretty inefficient way to pay someone with Bitcoin. As it functions better as a commodity, I prefer not to get rid of it as well.

Well that Keynsian BS has given rise to the economic prosperity we see today, where i can enjoy a lifestyle far greater than someone a hundred years ago.
If Keysian theory is BS, then surely you can point me to an economy somewhere in the world which utilizes deflation so everything is great?
If we consume less, surely businesses need to produce less, and need less workers? Those guys will be able to spend less (as they have no jobs)... so businesses need to produce less (and on, and on)
I agree with you that less economic activity could be good for the environment.
Moderate drops in prices of certain goods (food, energy, iphones) could be good... but when expanded to everything we buy, deflation is very bad for economies. 
I've not seen a better example of deflation being bad than Bitcoin. This shit is hoarded like hell.. I literally don't ever want to spend my Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:42:56
You could catch a drop, equally you'll be kicking yourself as we fly past 5k and be forced back in with less bitcoin for your money. 
That's the cost of trying to make a few bucks.
Do it a few times, you'll realise I if you want bitcoin or Fiat. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:45:08
Well we're still not entirely sure of the picture now. They man just be closing any exchange that messed around with ICO's
Personally, I want China to close the fucking lot down. Hopefully mining will become less centralized and China based too. 
Bitcoin got a little ahead of itself in my opinion... the next run in 12-48 months will be epic! LN should be live, exchanges should be more widespread too. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:59:39
Which one?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:11:02
Maybe... but the move from 1918 to 2919 and 2681 to 3336 were both pretty much exponential. Why didn't you sell then?
I thought 5k was pretty much the top, but I get hammered with capital gains tax if I sell. (I know, hindsight and all that)
I think Bitcoin will be higher in 5 years... so my strategy is to hold. Too stressful to do otherwise for me!
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:47:05

@_date: 2017-09-30 09:36:04
I don't think there's a huge amount of 'economic activity' with any crypto coin. Most of us are hodling in hopes it goes up in value. Long get the coin with the most chances of doing that (in my opinion) is the one with the most number of developers and solid road map of how to scale long term. I'm pretty bored of all of these attempt to take over bitcoin from miners or those with business interests.
I don't care if Bitcoin slows temporarily due to this, enough will have x2 coins on exchanges to dump them. Not to mention that there is absolutely no need for this half baked coin. If you want big blocks fuck off to bch, if you want segwit... We've already got it.
If anything this is just another attack on bitcoin... Which we will beat. Bitcoin will be stronger than ever once this shit is done.

I'm not 100 percent sure, I think you don't need to do anything. You just need the person you're sending too to have a segwit address.
I guess exchanges and wallets will all be upgraded soon. Perhaps they decided to wait a while to make sure everything is cool.
My ledger wallet allows me to receive segwit transactions.

@_date: 2017-10-26 05:56:38
There is probably a stock or investment or alt you could buy today which would make you very wealthy in 10 years. Are you going to regret not buying that today?
Nobody knew how big bitcoin was going to get. Nobody knows how big it is still going to get.
Even if you had bought, there is a massive chance you wouldn't have hodled until today. It's tanked a few times. $20 down to $1. Mid 200s down to 50, after 1100 there was a 2 year bear market. You would need to have had hands of steel. If I thought too much about how many I have sold I would cry. 
In 2014 I had read all about ethereum, signed up to the mailing list and got the email inviting me to the presale. I wrote it off though. 
In 8 years you could regret not buying as much as possible today... You could regret having bought any at all.
Such is life.

How are people supposed to buy Bitcoin if there are no on ramps.
I've heard of decentralized exchanges... but where do you send your FIAT? 
I think your idea is that you buy crypto, with other crypto. But what if I want FIAT for my crypto, to buy a car?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:07:32
You need to think longer term. In 5 or 10 years with bitcoins value considerably higher, it will become too costly for traders to swing the market. With less volatility it becomes more useful as a currency. The LN should be fully developed by then too so fees will be tiny. The high price will ensure that miners get sufficient reward. Don't judge bitcoin when it's still a youngster. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:20:16

@_date: 2017-09-15 16:11:00
Absolutely, this could be either a dead cat bounce or a bull trap.
Truth is, I'm totally guessing there too.
Ive been in Bitcoin since 2013 and this has happened a few times... I've come to the conclusion that I want to own bitcoin... So I don't sell. 
By the sounds of it you panicked and sold. I did the same in 2013 and sold about 30 coins for about £50 each. It's a tough lesson, and you're probably feeling shit now.  Especially if you sold at a loss! 
You must understand that there are a lot of emotional guys like yourself, that panic sell, then panic buy... It's basically free money for cool headed traders. You're probably thinking if you should buy back in now! Am I right?

I don't think it will become a widely used currency for most countries.
It *could* become a viable, non correlated asset... think Gold 2.0. 
It could gain some traction as a currency in countries which have poor currencies themselves.

As soon as you sell your Bitcoin you owe any tax over £11300 (see my other post for the rates). 10% or 18%. 
It doesn't matter if you buy a capital gains tax exempt item with the proceeds. You still owe the tax. 
No loophole. 
You could of course do it illegally and find someone who will sell you the gold coins under the counter for Bitcoin. But you do legally owe the tax. 
If you sell some on the 5th april and some on 6th april you make use of 2 years worth of tax allowance (£22600) tax free.

Its a psychological defense mechanism. During the bull run, he was probably as bullish and positive about Bitcoin as the rest of us. 
Now, having sold his coins he needs to reassure himself that he has done the right thing, and that Bitcoin will never ever be higher than the point he chose to sell. 
I'm not bashing him... I did a similar thing in 2013. I sold everything, and trash talked about how Bitcoin would be made illegal, its a ponzi etc. It was bizarre behavior... and I regret it. 
I ended up chasing back in a year later with far less Bitcoin.

I also buy traditional investments like stocks and shares hoping to sell them for a higher price one day. 
You are a prime example of a great use case for bitcoin (sending money home).

A Bitcoin world would just be continual boom and busts as people hoard the currency instead of spending it.

It's the ridiculous bch and it's retarded EDA which is causing the slightly higher fees on bitcoin. Miners switch to bch (removing hash power from the real bitcoin).

So you're saying you know better than professional economists and actual real world evidence based on 100's or years of global economic experience?
Instead of 3% inflation, you would prefer 3% deflation (a 6% difference)? That would have a very negative drag affect on the economy. 
Our nations would all be worse off, not better. 
Not to mention, there being absolutely no advantages to switching from our regular currencies for the vast majority of us.
Or the fact that with no tax revenue we would have no Government and everything would fall to shit. 
And you still have the other problems I mentioned of having zero economic tools to steer an economy out of recessions and depressions. 
It is coming off the Gold standard which finally got the US out of its depression in the 1920's/30's.

@_date: 2017-10-21 21:52:24
I think those people are in the minority if I'm honest... most here are simply buzzing because its increasing in value. Same as in r/ethtrader. Smart contracts and such will be a thing in the future, is Eth part of that? Maybe. It doesn't need a high valuation for that use case though. The scaling issue of Ethereum also makes me doubt its longevity.

The Bitcoin gold website looks so fucking amateurish. My only hope is that once all these forks fail to dethrone bitcoin, it makes us stronger as it's just another attack vector that didn't work.
Agree that it looks bad to the public though.

I'm subbed to multiple crypto subs...  as this one talked me out of buying ethereum in 2014! In none of the other subs do I find a group of people who actually use crypto to any great extent. Sure, people pretend they do... But really, what can you actually spend bch on? I get the arguments for it... I just prefer the segwit effort to scale though. I think all these forks are damaging to us all though. I'm still confident that bitcoin will prevail. You'll have a different opinion, so let's not fall out over this! Nobody can really tell the future.

You're assuming everyone dumps at the same time. That's not how this works. 
Some will hodl regardless of exchange rate
Others will drop out at varying stages up to 2020... they wont all reach a 'magic number' at a particular time. 
Those that drop out will be replaced by those new to crypto. 
Historically, Bitcoin overheats and then drops... this has happened a number of times... and will probable happen a few more until we get so a more stable value.

Really? Its massively speculative. It generates no income or dividends, and you are entirely dependent on someone buying your coins off you at a higher price in the future. I'm not saying they wont... but you are gambling that they will. That's speculating, not investing... and certainly not sound financial planning worthy of r/personalfinance. 
You make this seem like a Ponzi, especially not qualifying your reason as to why this will keep climbing.

@_date: 2017-09-15 16:11:00
Absolutely, this could be either a dead cat bounce or a bull trap.
Truth is, I'm totally guessing there too.
Ive been in Bitcoin since 2013 and this has happened a few times... I've come to the conclusion that I want to own bitcoin... So I don't sell. 
By the sounds of it you panicked and sold. I did the same in 2013 and sold about 30 coins for about £50 each. It's a tough lesson, and you're probably feeling shit now.  Especially if you sold at a loss! 
You must understand that there are a lot of emotional guys like yourself, that panic sell, then panic buy... It's basically free money for cool headed traders. You're probably thinking if you should buy back in now! Am I right? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:11:26

There's nothing I can really offer to destroy your theory... Only to say, people have been telling me that theory since bitcoin was in the single digits.
Just sit it out, smug in your belief that 'you're not stupid, poor or too afraid to buy any Bitcoin'
In 5 or 10 years, you'll have your answer... Either, you were correct!.. 
Well done! You sure told us idiots!
You missed out on the greatest opportunity of a generation (if not ever).
Either way, do you not have anything better to do with your time today? 
And yes, the average US citizen probably does think this is a bubble (for it record, it likely is in a bubble state right now)...
However, I doubt the average person understands the potential here. We're talking about a group of people who voted trump into power :) ha
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:21:15

When every jackass is convincing their mum to buy bitcoin after a huge rally, it indicates that the rally is probably coming to an end. The dumb money is arriving. Are you sure you want to risk your mother's money in something this risky? Have you zoomed out on the charts to see how the multiple previous bubbles have ended?
The very fact you don't know what "top confirmed" means, indicates you should perhaps learn a bit before investing your mum's cash in something you don't really understand. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:51:19
Just re-frame how you view it. Do you have regrets that you didn't choose the right lottery numbers this week?
Its all in context anyway... if you regret buying at price x because it goes up 50%, you wouldn't regret not buying if it drops 80%. 
If you want Bitcoin for the long term, just buy it. If it succeeds a few hundred difference either way really wont amount to shit.
If you are simply in it to double or triple your money its going to be stressful. Those of us who have been here for a while have become quite immune to the swings... its really quite strange. 
I remember when I started, panic buying, panic selling... losing Bitcoin. It was mad, but I learnt a lot about myself in the process. 
Another way of reducing stress, is to only invest what you are willing and able to afford. It saddens me to read of kids putting all of their savings into this. 
They panic sell, making the price more volatile and making whales and traders wealthier.
As is true of the stock market... this market rewards patience.

No idea, I guess the butterfly effect could mean that you accidentally buy one Bitcoin which was responsible for kicking this whole thing before it even took off.  
You could kill the whole thing! 
You'd be better going back to 2012 / 13 and use your knowledge of the movements then... you could still make a fucking fortune and not risk killing it before it started. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:40:29
I'm guessing what I was driving at was the number of unconfirmed transactions going through the roof, and the complete lack of compromise being made, despite good initial efforts.

Well temporarily I guess, from sending coins to exchanges.

Why are you convinced by this?... Yet another alt coin, built in an alt coin trying to solve a problem which the mainstream don't really care about? 
As one example...So what if WhatsApp and others are centralised?... It works perfectly well and is encrypted. Is the future really somewhere that you have to speculate on tokens just to gain access to a service which is free elsewhere?
Will the world become a constant stream of pump and dump, jumping to the next best thing?

Didn't seem "closed door" to me... some big names were associated with it.  Something decentralized is not going to magically gain a consensus on the direction that is taken unless groups get together and do something. 
UASF? Doesn't look like its popular enough. I cant even be fucked to create a node as the blockchain is so big.
 
At the moment, at worst nothing will happen... at best a split of the blockchain will happen and Bitcoin will tank and possibly never recover. 
Who are you anyway? A core coder? Why should your opinion mean anything? What have you done to try and resolve the crisis?
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:01:38
Just human nature I guess. When people get told they are wrong, they further entrench in their own beliefs. Doesn't help being in an echo chamber. I visit r/btc for a bit of balance. It's the same over there... Except a mirror of here.
It's all very poisonous on both sides... To the extent that when some sort of compromise is being forced, both trash it. Things don't look good.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:13:58
And Bitcoin will probably tank hard before that, and even more if UASF doesn't have the support people think it will.

I imagine you could get in deep shit for withholding assets from the court. They would be able to examine your bank account to see that you transferred your funds to a Bitcoin exchange.

They have both said they are happy to go ahead with Segwit and a HF.

How can they be stalling, if the other side have their own plan?
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:25:27
We're all guessing mate. I was guessing that buying Bitcoin in 2012 was a good idea (it was). 
I wouldn't say "none of you know what you are talking about"... you cant say that. There are some extremely intelligent and well informed people on here. 
Sure there are some idiots who borrowed money of their Mums hoping to make a quick buck too. But so what? Diversity is important, just let everyone take their path. 
The worst type of people here are the arrogant people who do think they "know it all". You do not. 
Accept that, Its quite liberating. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:45:35
I wouldn't call it information... just speculation mixed with some arrogance, a touch of ETH pump and a ridiculous conspiracy.  
Some of the "hard heads" here have lived through 4 or 5 of these bubbles and are far better placed to predict where the market is going. Personally, I don't give a shit for any predictions though.  
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:47:43
Its an agreement, its good. So what if they have to sit down and clarify exactly the terms. 
People here just shout the rather sad "keep calm and UASF"... its at 8%, I very much doubt its going to happen. 
So we lose an opportunity and possibly lose the race with an alt. 
I honestly couldn't give a fuck if we HF or Segwit, or some combination of both... lets fucking do something!!! (safely of course) 
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:32:43
You'll have to define 'this'. Currently it's being used as a highly speculative commodity with a fringe of users buying good from the dark web, or maybe sending cash abroad. The general populous don't want or need bitcoin as a currency. It's a complete pain in the ass to use.

If you're still concerned Electrum lets you export your private keys to a file. 
Be careful with that though. Ensure you are working on a clean machine and store the keys somewhere safe.

This is the wrong place to ask. Would you go to an forum if apple stock holders to ask if you should buy Apple stock?
Go away, learn about bitcoin and make your own mind up. It's all dependent on your net worth, income, risk tolerance, time horizon, emotional stability, experience etc etc. 
Zoom out on the charts and see how it's moved before... Would you be affected if your 'investment' lost half its value for a few years, or hot zero?

If you're not one of the multitude of bullshitters / trolls asking similar questions...

As for taxes... just pay them you cheap bastard. Its not like you would be poor with that theoretical amount of money.

I've used bitcoin quite a bit in the last 4 years. Sometimes a reasonable experience. Often slow, hard work to purchase and store, and not many places to spend it.
I paid for a VPN once... They cancelled my subscription after 3 months and I had no proof that I'd paid. I've not bothered using it at all recently, as the deflationary nature means I don't want to spend it. The fees are crazy too and it can take days to send

OK, if its stopping a change in protocol I can see it from that angle. 
However, I think its probably fair game if the found a hardware advantage. The algorithm itself hasn't been compromised... so its just that they have superior tech. 
Its no more of an advantage than living in a country with cheaper electricity and labor... or being able to afford better technology. 
If this was a US company which invented AsicBoost I doubt it would be considered a problem.

Well that sucks... I think a lot of peoples idea of being safe rather than sorry will be to sell before. Or diversify into Ethereum. 
I think Ether looks over hyped, but I'm still considering swapping a few BTC for them.
Is there any clue as to how much support UASF has? I support it, but I have no way of showing that support as my bandwidth doesn't allow me to download the blockchain!!
I think a lot of users wont show support (despite thinking in principle that it is a good idea)
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:38:17

But tell him over longer periods Bitcoin is way ahead in terms of ROI. 
Also tell him that past performance does not indicate future performance. 
Also tell him, they are not really competitors.

We see this posts everyday mate, I frankly don't care if someone regrets selling or regrets buying... Fucking everyone here regrets something about bitcoin. I regret not mortgaging my house and buying 100000 btc in 2012. I don't go posting that.
Also, if you think the price is too high, you have your answer already. This is a bitcoin forum full of bitcoin pumpers, hodlers and addicts... Don't you think the advice will be a little biased?
We don't know anything about you, your income, your risk tolerance, your net worth... We certainly don't know the price of bitcoin tomorrow, let alone in the future.

What I meant was, to try and get some scaling solution I would set up a node if it were easy for me. It is not. 
I don't really care what size the blockchain is as I don't have to download the blockchain to use Bitcoin.
Do I just not want to use Bitcoin? ... not really. Its just a speculative gamble for me. I have only a couple of small use cases for Bitcoin...but credit cards and PayPal are easier. 
That and I dont want to spend Bitcoin as its a pain in the ass to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:09:46
Just a regular user who's getting fed up with all the bullshit around Bitcoin. Like I said, I couldn't care less which route we go... a safe mix of both sounds great. And that's what the consensus chaps looked like they were working towards.

Your comment is completely irrelevant. I'm not arguing it won't ever reach 100k. I'm saying it wouldn't reach that tomorrow if people stopped selling. Even if one person bought at that price... Every hodler and their mother would sell hoping to get 100000 per coin and the price would tank.

Peoples views can change. I've flipped flopped between bigger blocks and segwit over the years. Now I don't give a shit as long as something happens. I'm just building resentment for the awkward people around here who wont budge and 'assume' what the other side wants.

The only question I have I guess is: if I'm using Multibit (which does not download the blockchain) are my coins safe in the event of a softfork?
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:02:22
You do realise that this market is being pushed around by extremely wealthy people/groups who just salivate at the thought of people like you?
 You buy high, panic when the price drops... And somehow you think you know when we "bottom out".
 So you again buy back in. 
Rinse, repeat... Slowly extracting your wealth from you.
 What you are seeing now could quite possibly be a bull trap. Are you going to panic and sell if we start going down again?
You sound far too emotional, and overinvested.

You're comments don't go over my head. I just don't get any value from what you say. 
I'm not even interested why you think Bitcoin will break its long term behavior and revert back to 2800 by October. 
If I had to guess, it will be a couple of years before we hit another significant bull run. Bitcoin crashes like these have always been long drawn out affairs. 
I might throw a couple of BTC into Ethereum... just researching it now. Dash just sounds like a load of shit.
Crypto is a very small part of my portfolio, so don't worry about the quality of the rest of my life. I have all bases covered... a mixture of hard work, good investments, inheritance and luck.
I wont be salty in Oct whatever the price of Bitcoin. I have zero emotions about it today. Its just a long term gamble for me... a bit of fun and I find the project interesting. 
I made my initial 'investment' back (and some) in 2013.

Good points. That's sort of why I've stayed out of Eth... I imagine its pumped by kids who think they missed the Bitcoin boat. They haven't been through crashes before and will panic hard when it starts to dip... just as I did losing my Bitcoin bubble virginity!
I'm guessing some might cash out to BTC when it dives too?
Most likely I'll just Hodl on through until this one comes crashing down!  
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:51:00
Ridiculous advice to give people. Bitcoin is a highly risky, volatile asset which is quite possibly in yet another bubble. You should only risk what you are willing and able to lose. Make sure you have all of your costs covered, and an emergency fund before you start buying into this.

Tell him you don't know what you are talking about, the thing you saw was someone else not knowing what they were talking about. 
And he should realize that whoever told him it would be 1 mill didn't know what they were talking about. 
Everyone is guessing. 
Bitcoin may fade, but I have no reason to believe it will. It has been stress tested for 8 years, has a huge first mover advantage over other coins. Has by far the biggest infrastructure (people actually using it) and even if an alt did gain something Bitcoin didnt have... Bitcoin could be upgraded. Not to mention, that it just smashed its all time high and is on pretty much every major finance news outlet,
Do you see nem, dash or any other shitcoin doing that any time soon? nope
Bitcoin also has a huge number of developers vs any of those mums basement created coins. (Ethereum is an exception... but not really a competitor)
You are also left with the impossible choice of selecting 1 of hundreds 'alts' all being pumped and dumped. So good luck with that. They are mostly toys for people who feel they 'missed the boat' on Bitcoin and that the price per coin is too high. 
He's only buying 1 Bitcoin! If he's that worried about a couple of hundred here or there... perhaps he shouldn't be sinking his money into Bitcoin. 
Tell him to do his own research!!! You (nor I ) can make his decision for him!

Fair enough, it was still a good attempt... Why don't core engage with them? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:24:16
I absolutely can be neutral...I am a regular bitcoin user. I don't really understand the deep technical details of Segwit or a Hardfork. So I'd just be guessing if I supported one or the other. I just want something to happen! Seems like the momentum for Segwit with a later hardfork has fallen through, with people in this echo chamber now just shouting UASF!!! Sounds like that's just going to split the chain and fuck everything up for a while. 
Tldr... I'm not a coder or a miner so I can't really know what the best option is.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:11:10
As you've stated, you aren't very familiar with this... I wouldn't give him any input, positive or negative. If it tanks down 50 percent after you are all positive, it could strain your relationship. 
Why the fuck isn't he doing his own research?

How the fuck should we know? We don't know your net worth, income, your objective, risk tolerance or the future price of bitcoin. Do your research.

@_date: 2017-05-31 09:22:36
How about access to cheap electricity? Is that not a huge advantage to mining centralization?
The only reason it is perhaps bad, is if it is the reason the Jihan does not want Segwit.
However, hasnt he said he agrees to Segwit if it comes with a HF?
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:43:09
A lot of BTC has probably flowed to the alts already as a hedge... when (if) it comes back its just going to burn the new alt investors. But they probably weren't Bitcoiners anyway... so who cares!
So in a way, Bitcoin is sort of secretly eating the alts... even though it looks like the other way around. 
The only problem being, if you go down that route... you have to time your jump back to Bitcoin correctly. The alts could tank hard and fast as BTC shoots the other direction. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:18:37

2 years ago the price was about $250... I'd only have 12 Bitcoins. I probably wouldn't do anything.

@_date: 2017-05-25 06:15:20
A fight to the death sounds like a terrible strategy.
"Seems" does not sound convincing.
I'm probably on the side of Segwit, but I'd be happy with SW and a blocksize increase. In the event of a split, I'd support the largest chain.
I don't really have a way of supporting anything though as I'm a typical hodler... I'd probably just sell if anyone tried to force anything. 
Just my humble opinion. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:20:17

 The agreement may not be perfect but people should be working towards ironing out issues. I'm perfectly fine with Segwit and a hardfork. Both sides are happy.
 Only fringe hardliners are left holding us back... Add possibly killing bitcoin in the process.
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:26:34
Say Segwit does not activate... what will be the focus on to achieve a scaling solution?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:22:42
Well some would argue that it's a commodity like gold too.
When/if the scaling issue gets resolved I think it's preferable to eth as a currency. It's not as centralised, the inflation rate is known and stable, it has less chance of being rolled back if the big players are set to lose money, it's more secure, and it has less of a footprint for attack.
I think something that is meant to secure a multi billion market cap should be specialised and as simple as it needs to be.
Ethereum does look like it can do some cool things though. There's room for both.

@_date: 2017-05-24 04:25:39
I kind of agree. Historically the pattern would indicate a crash will occur after a run like we are seeing... However, if Bitcoin is to succeed one of these bubbles is going to inflate and just fucking stay inflated! There's also the chance of a black swan event... What if the stock market crashed like 08? Would a ton of capital flow to bitcoin?

Perhaps I just need to take some off the table and sell into this rally... I dont know. Cant think straight today... I sent a BIG transaction earlier and the damn thing hasn't confirmed 11 hours later despite having a fee of $2.7 :/

Ok, so if you've got your initial money back... Fuck it. Keep them... 1 or 2 bitcoins aren't worth that much really. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:16:58
Yes, but which should you select if you wanted to send, say 5 bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:41:34
Well they're not an investment for a start. And I don't mind a couple of percent inflation... It helps drive the economy. If fiat was deflationary you'd see people hodling it not spending it (as we see with bitcoin). Bitcoin could lose 50 percent of its purchasing power at anytime... That is real risk.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:54:38
What are the benefits of having multiple operating systems? Windows, Linux, Chrome, Apple?
People simply cant agree on what is 'best'...its human nature. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:16:38
Are you serious?
 If I want to send 5btc I should pay a fee of $140??!?
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:36:04
And who is going to pay unlimited dollars for a bitcoin? 
Everyone here has a price they would sell at. Well most... Some would hold till the bitter end.

I've seen a couple I like... but seriously, its hard to ascertain the fundamental value from all the pump that is going on. 
The future does look like its going to be multiple coins though... sort of like the OS world, Windows/Linux/Apple/Chrome etc. 
I've not tried day trading since about 2014 when I panic sold and lost about 2 Bitcoins. 
Really wish I had locked my coins up in cold storage in 2013!!!

Nice, I started 2013.. so this is my 3rd. 
Similar to you I cashed out a bit... playing with house money now. 
Still, getting an itchy trigger finger at the moment due to the non resolution of the scaling issue and Eth at our coming up from behind!
I've not diversified at all.

The banksters don't want shit to do with Bitcoin. They'll take ripple or another alt. They would prefer to see bitcoin fail. And the community seem to be obliging by not coming to a compromise.

Sorry for the possibly lame question... but would BIP148 software include Electrum and Mycilium wallets (who said they support Segwit). Or are my coins safe? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:15:40
But wont one chain disappear eventually? Miners aren't going to mine both chains, they will pick the most popular one..
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:32:07
Be careful with that, should this bubble crash as it has done multiple times over the years, you may upset friends and family.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:58:58
If you don't want to lose it, don't put it into something as risky and volatile as bitcoin. On the plus side, it's only $150... You're young and in a few years you'll laugh at your panicking ass this evening :). Learn from it! Nobody can tell you what to do now... Relax and think logically. How would you feel if you lost half of it? What are the odds that this will keep going up? I don't know the answer. All I know is that you shouldn't invest more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:56:58
For me it's not a better currency than fiat. I can buy anything with fiat, I get paid in fiat, I know how much my fiat will be worth next week. There are not two crazy groups arguing to split my fiat in two.
Gold and silver have been a store of value for thousands of years. Bitcoin has been all over the shop for a few years.
Why am I here? I'm just like the majority...hodling. i.e, not using it as a currency. I intend to sell at some point back to fiat. 
I might keep some for some fringe use cases.
I don't think 10 percent is likely, no.
I would like it to obviously.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:57:06
Do you seriously think the general public would prefer to use bitcoin instead of a credit card? Where they can buy something and pay for it later. And also, they are guarded from fraud and the item is insured? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:29:34
I'm a user. I don't want that responsibility as I don't understand the technological side of it deeply enough. Sure Segwit sounds like a good idea, but what the fuck do I know. Bigger blocks sound like a great idea too. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:12:22
That was my first bubble... It took a few months too. The crash was pretty brutal though. This would could drop to 1000 quite easily too.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:15:01
Pretty simple choice, get your money back... Even take a little extra. You'll feel less stressed and inclined to write posts like this. You'll still be well positioned. You're getting a little greedy!!!

Not my comment, but taken from above. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:12:51
As a thought experiment... Imagine you had got to 1million yesterday and went through that brutal drop. Losing 200k in a few short moments... Not knowing if it's going to drop another 40 percent. You are going to need balls of steel to hodl with that amount.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:50:57
What start and end point are you using? If you start from $1 per coin... Bitcoin is winning hands down. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:32:04
At this point mate, none of that matters. People on both sides have been dicks.
The community has become quite toxic, emotions are high and people have doubled down on their own opinions. 
This proposal looks like a good way forward, and possibly the only way without burning this all to the ground. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:43:53

150GB is already too much for many of us who live in the developed World. 
Why would I bother to buy a raspberry Pi, and learn a load of geeky shit to make it work... when I can buy an alt which lets me send money in seconds for little cost. 
Nobody has said anything about 8MB blocks.

Cant imagine the PR we get from that will be particularly good. 
In the event of BIP 138 failing, what then? A second attempt at Segwit? A Hardfork in 6 months or longer? 
Could cost a fortune to send transactions by then!!
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:07:21
200000 coins being dumped on the market will make you remarkable happy?
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:08:36
What do I like about Bip48? That there is a chance something might actually happen that will stop this ridiculous gridlock.
 I won't be contributing to it though... The blockchain is too big for me to download.
What troubles me? That support for it will be too low, or that it will create a shitshow of a split chain and fuck bitcoin hard.
A mixture of Segwit and a hardfork... which the other side agreed too, seems like a good compromise. Everyone wins and we move on.
As I understand it though, Segwit via a hardfork means that asicboost is still an option... Which is a bad thing (I'm unclear on this though).
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:31:00
I guess my main thought is that most of the 'users' of a user activated choice, have no clue what is best. That doesn't seem like the optimal solution. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:50:26
That's not how realty works. Nobody is going to pay 100000 for a bitcoin.

Silly advice, if it did fall, the brazil correction would be higher than elsewhere so you make no net gain.

I live in the UK... but in the countryside. Downloading 150gb is going to cost me money. Even if I do, does my node 'vote' for a preferred chain?
I don't need a node to use my Ledger nano s or Electrum. 
Also, most people don't care if a "shitcoin" is pre-mined... they just want a crypto which isn't paralyzed in terms of development. We want to send transactions quickly with little or no cost. Nether of which Bitcoin is capable of at the moment.  
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:34:23
It's that sort of arrogance which nearly (and still may) cost bitcoin it's dominance.

Your attempt to warn people is coming from a place of hubris and arrogance... you have no real intention of helping people. 
I guess you get some sort of sick buzz out of trying to rub it in peoples faces that you were right, and they were wrong this time?
That's pretty sad my friend. And you're pointing it in the wrong direction anyway... I have no feelings one way or the other concerning the obvious drop. There's a good chance we'll see a few more (hopefully bigger) bubbles and pops over the coming decade. 
Just relax and enjoy the show :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:09:42
I really couldn't care less about the price of Bitcoin today... I have plenty of coins and I'm in this for the long term. 
I don't count my paper gains as part of my wealth. (Of which I have plenty... see both of us can be arrogant champ) 
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:20:35

@_date: 2019-05-17 05:41:51
So selling 9k coins manipulation, but buying those 9k and sending the price up ridiculously isn't ? Its probably just a hedge fund milking all the fomo noobs...who then panic sell.
They should remain anonymous, they make bitcoin what it is.
@_date: 2017-05-20 11:15:31
How much would it influence the global economy? Seriously??? Basically not in the slightest. It's tiny.
It's bubbled up before a few times. If (when) it crashes, it will probably tank down to $1000. A lot of idiots who don't know what they are doing will panic and feel terrible. The suicide hotline will be posted on this sub, as moronic children who 'invested' all their spare pocket money cry at their stupidity and wonder why an asset class simply didn't just increasing exponentially until they were millionaires. Many will sell and never want to see bitcoin again. In a few years it may bubble up again... Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:36:03
Also... Why do you need multiple trezors?
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:42:36
Whilst I'm not a huge fan of inflation, it's quite good for an economy as it promotes investment and spending instead of holding cash. The US has done pretty well since 1913

@_date: 2017-05-22 05:30:24
I would do, but the blockchain too big. Took me days to sync a couple of years ago!
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:34:32
It's stupid to regret something you didn't do. I didn't pick the correct lottery tickets that year either. Also, even if you had mined some coins... It's highly likely you would have sold them when they reached the colossal (at the time) price points of $1 or $20. Just think about it... Most bitcoins sold today have previous owners who sold way too early. 
Just concentrate on making the correct decisions today.

@_date: 2017-05-27 13:04:08
Anyone with eyes could see that bubble was going to crash at some point; as it has done multiple times over the years. 
Don't flatter yourself too much ... you're just as bad as those you think "know it all"
I was called a gambler, an idiot (and lots of other things) buying into previous bubbles. Those who don't panic in these times (historically at least) have always come out on top in time. 
Sure, that may have been the highest ATH Bitcoin will ever see... but it equally may not be.
I feel kind of sorry for those "gamblers"... but they are currently learning valuable lessons about how markets work, and their emotions when things reverse in trend. 
Drop the arrogance though mate. 
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:51:27
My guess is, 12m to halvening.  Zoom out on the charts and a nice peak around then would mean we start the bull run around now. Could see some serious shit these next 12 months.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:37:20
How so? Segwit may have been ideal a couple of years ago. Even if it gets activated... In 6 or 12 months it might not be enough and we'll be back to slow and costly transactions. 
The flippening will probably happen for sure then. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:30:53
"this time it's different"
Meh, same old same old. People just try and find a narrative for these bubbles... If it wasn't Willy bot, it would be some other shit.
There's no scaling solution will probably be the reason given for this one. 
Fully agree it's all about us speculators though.
Humans are so dumb, we'll see basically the same chart as before (only bigger, and over a longer period).
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:01:38
Mycilium and Multibit
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:21:55
Can you imagine the bad press we would get though? Most people hadn't heard of Ethereum when that happened.
If I was new to bitcoin I would stay the fuck away if I heard that the chain would split! Thats like the possibility of my bank account changing currencies!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:07:03
Change of subject... are you an actual sociopath?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:26:44
No mate, you just sound like a dick. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:09:35
I'm not that technical, but from what I understand nodes don't really mean much anyway. 
The blockchain is already so big that I can't be bothered to download it (and I live in the west) , so what's the problem with a 2mb+ blocksize. 
All the arguments against it just sound like paranoia. 
At the moment its retarded, I've probably spent $50 just sending a few basic transactions this month. 
I love bitcoin, but I've had to diversify into eth and other cryptos as bitcoin is so shit and the community has become so toxic. 
Just having segwit could mean it's still crippled in 12 months and theres, no guarantee LN will be ready or functionally good enough to fix things. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:39:46
If there is a prolonged chain split, there will be a lot less transactions as people move back to fiat or alt coins too. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:15:10
I really don't give a shit at this point. Pretty obvious that we are in a stale mate at the moment.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:49:22
I think that pain is a right of passage for young bitcoiners. I went through it a few years ago... It taught me so much about myself. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:52:11
Its got a blocksize increase so the miners are happy.
Its got Segwit, so the religious "must scale off chain only" folk are happy.
And its a nice compromise for the vast majority of the regular users who are fucking fed up of all of this, and have largely diversified out to other coins and can see this war demoting Bitcoin to an alt soon. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:34:17
I was born in the red, moulded by it... I didn't see the a green candle until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!
Quite possibly you have a long Hodl on your hands now buddy. 
Just ask yourself... in 5 years will Bitcoin be higher than it is now?
That will give you your answer. 
FWIW, this turned the instant Eth hit 400... they were 80% of their stupid flippening goal. 
We'll come back from this... with a scaling solution!!
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:58:24
That's nonsense. Bitcoin can't get stuck forever. It will either confirm or return to his wallet after a couple of weeks if his fee as too low.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:53:30
I agree, this wont 'kill' Bitcoin... But it will be dropping down the charts unless its upgraded soon. 
I waited 2 days for a transaction earlier in the week by using my wallets default fee. Newcomers will see that as a joke. 
I've been here for 4 years and even I'm getting fucked off with it. 
I don't care how its fixed, Segwit, HF, a mixture... stubbornness and a lack of ability to compromise could lose Bitcoin its huge destiny. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:55:09
What on earth makes you think the next Amazon will be made on Ethereum or have an unregulated ICO?  
Right... just like the BATS shit show where only a handful of people bought their tokens.

Will you be my friend?
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:49:16
Status quo means even more people leaving for alts.... which they have been, in droves. 
Status quo will relegate Bitcoin to being an alt quicker than you think. 
I don't care about the risk of a hard fork... the risk of doing nothing is far greater. It may already be too late. 
Its no use as a store of value unless its the no.1 coin... otherwise its continued cycles of boom and bust. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:08:18
They were still very young and not really in the public spotlight.
If we split now, fuck it... I'm probably divesting. 
Nobody in their right mind for a decade is going to use bitcoin as anymore than a speculative pump and dump.
At best they would swap to another currency which isn't controlled by just a few groups... Or, one which has some central control.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:34:33
Sure, it could be exchanges... Maybe. But that's the price you pay for entering a largely unregulated market. Banning big players seems to be a bad idea, unless you want bitcoin to go nowhere.
If anything, you should want even bigger sharks to enter the waters. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen!

This situation is completely ridiculous. In r/btc they are paranoid that segwitx2 will do the opposite.. Segwit being activated whilst delaying a blocksize increase.
Why is it so hard to just have both.
To me it's the obvious solution, a chain split will be devastating.
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:57:43

Does that mean you can have two wallets which are able to both spend the coins? 
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:45:29
I'm guessing you're new to bitcoin and have no understanding of mainstream investing?
Zoom out on the bitcoin charts... Every single time bitcoin hits an all time high, after a massive run up like we've had, it is followed by a massive correction.
That 200 could easily tank to 100 or less. 
Secondly, the stock market does occasionally crash. But far far less frequently than a speculative asset such as bitcoin.
Also, over the long term stocks rise around 7 percent per year. 
Many pay you a dividend to, instead of relying on 'greater fool' theory to sell your asset at a profit.
Bitcoin is massively risky compared to stocks and shares.
Sure keeping money in a bank account will lose a bit of purchase power each year. But a couple of percent on 200 isn't much. Cash is very low risk. Which this guy wants, if it's a lot of money to him.

The latest ICO was a complete farce and scam. They changed the rules and extended the donation period during the donation period. They claimed there was a ddos.
Bancors plan equates basically to knocking up dodgy derivatives.
So it's an 2008 crash wrapped up in a .com bubble, wrapped up in a currency bubble!!!
That's not saying bitcoin isn't in a bubble...I just think those arrogant, Lamborghini dreaming, weak handed pretenders are due for a much bigger fall.

@_date: 2017-06-01 12:08:23


Hardly... a lot of the price movement in worthless alts are kids who missed the train on Bitcoin. Or Bitcoiners diversifying until the scaling issue is resolved. 
I've done it myself! I have no need or intention of keeping my Ethereum though. Its just a bit of fun and profit.
Besides, competition is healthy! I've not seen a real competitor (for a currency / store of value) yet though. 
I don't want to buy some scammy looking tokens for a company that probably wont make any money either... but it will be fun watching that shit implode.

Bitcoin however has a risk of stagnating and not getting a resolution to the scaling issue though!

His post is in no way FUD, trolling or shilling. 
He's just wondering what the risks are which is a valid concern... he's not implying the price will be less than today. But there is a risk it could be. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:38:13
I did similar, Bitcoin is a completely seductive bitch though. At the bottom I was feeling quite smug. 
As it rose, I realized I want to hodl Bitcoin not fiat!
Of course this could be a trap... but long term I thing we're golden if we sort the scaling issues.
Selling to make a profit is pretty stressful, those rich folk and their bots are impossible to beat. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:57:33

If you have the seed on a physical piece of paper, that's all you need to recover your Bitcoins. 
Install Electrum on another machine and plug in the seed. 
Having your private keys on a USB is a further step in security. 
If you want a further mitigation against total loss... keep a copy of the seed or your keys in a different house. (In case of fire).
The ledger would be the same deal... (I've just ordered one too). Just keep 2 copies of the words it gives you when setting it up. 
Just relax, take your time. It can be a bit nerve wracking... but its pretty straight forward really. 
Also, when you send BTC to the wallet... have a test run with a fraction of a coin. Send it to the wallet. Let it fully confirm... then send some to another wallet. 
The high fees at the moment are quite annoying (whilst testing and playing with Bitcoin)... but with luck that nonsense will be addressed in near future. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:15:46
Yea, nothing to see here... we are all idiots and you know better than us.

@_date: 2017-06-04 13:22:01
Its just a bad user experience. With alts available which cost pennies to send why would people choose Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-03 05:43:58

If I was in charge (I'm not) I would activate Segwit now.
Rocket boosters engage! We'll blast past 3000 leaving Eth in our dust.
We can then do a block size increase safely, at a later date.
Shit... BU and Core should work together on this second bit and make friends.
Pretty sure this would make the vast majority of people happy.
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:04:38
Its healthy, Bitcoin needed some competition to set a fire under its ass. The buzz also helps both.

@_date: 2017-06-01 12:34:36
I don't see the point of litecoin, Its just a clone of Bitcoin.
It may be a reasonable test bed for Bitcoin tech (LN). But I don't think it will ever be worth anything. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:49:58
I don't think its an attack. They want things to go one way... as it is in their financial interest to do so. 
And others want Segwit and LN as they believe that is in the best interest of Bitcoin.  (And subsequently their own financial interest). 
At least Jihan has agreed to Segwit and a HF. 
Right now, fuck it... I'd go for that. 
Either that or we bleed out and go the way of Yahoo. 
Just stop throwing around 'attack' and such. They are just humans with differing opinions and interests to you. 
We need miners to do their thing! If Jihan found a competitive advantage, others need to up their game too.

It's just human nature, im gen x so can sort of remember the .com bubble. Most of the guys throwing money into these are millennials so it's just ancient history for them.

Yea, I've been drawn into debates with both bitcoiners and ethereums. So strange how you can identity with a group and hate another. The weirdest part is that over time my own opinion changes too. I would probably have a heated debate with myself from 2 months ago!
You're right, it's best to divorce emotion from this. Not easy when you have skin in the game though!

I have come to the following conclusions concerning Bitcoin; 
1) Bitcoin rewards the patient Hodler. 
2) Bitcoin punishes you regardless of your decision to buy or sell. Quite often instantly after your decision.  
3) You can threaten, and attack it from any vector... and despite all logic it will suck it up and get stronger. 
4) It don't care

The idea is to still use a software wallet which syncs online... but have your private keys separate and offline. 
You can then use the device to sign a transaction.

The first bubble in 2013 went up to like 260 then crashed HARD... all the way down to 50 or something. Unless you had been in one of the previous bubbles it seemed like the world was ending and Bitcoin was dead. 
I would have sold most of those then (I sold a lot then, thinking I made out like a bandit).
However with 7500 coins, he could have kept a few thousand and sold a few thousand and still been a millionaire.
You just have to move on though and make better decisions today.
I completely fucked up by not buying the Ethereum pre-sale which I was really close to pulling the trigger on. 2000 Eth for 1btc.
Everyone on this sub were like "its vaporware, it inflates too much, its a scam" etc etc.
Really opened my eyes to how bad these echo chambers are.
Do your own research!!!
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:01:00
They don't want "high fees"... They just want to activate a version of Segwit which kills covert ASIC boost and causes Chinese mining centralisation.... Together with an effective 2mb increase.
They are also not opposed to bigger blocks after Segwit.

Ha! Sorry... Yea... That's not biased then.

Experience has taught me that bitcoin is truly anti fragile... It is indeed the Honey Badger of currencies. Everytime I have lost faith, or sold my coins... Has been a bad move. Just recently I could have sworn the peak was going to be followed by a dead cat bounce and then tumble down. Yet here we are climbing again. 
I'm hoping that in the near future a path will be found to escape the current scaling issues we have.
Once we do, I would be surprised to see a drop.
I'm not that concerned about ETH. I think a lot of the money flowing into that is from bitcoiners hedging their bets... They will return!
All of those ICOs look a bit scammy and their tech isn't proven yet. Some interesting ideas, but I don't see it as a competitor that will dethrone bitcoin.
The competition is good though as it adds urgency to our current problem.
On another note, I can't imagine leaving bitcoin...I would miss the drama ��

He's omitting the fact that as the price drops, more people will see the new lower price as an attractive entry point... so demand reduces/stops or reverses a drop. We see this time and time again. 
Just look at the start of the video... the guy is a silver/gold bug. He's been taking it in the hoop for the last few years as the price of both has tanked. 
They are just scared that 'their' asset has a new digital version (Bitcoin). And there is a lot of jealousy that they didn't buy in earlier. 
Too scared to diversify in, they feel the need to claim 'once again' that Bitcoin is dead. Yes, its died a few times now... but the honey badger doesn't seem to care.

Not really, as those things will probably be coming to Bitcoin soon and the gains will be greater. Not sure what msk is... but if its anonymity I would just swap out for a couple of specialist alts. 
Bitcoin is the Gold, and I'm pretty sure it will stay that way.
Litecoin just doesn't bring enough 'new' to the table. You are doing a good service testing LN though! 
Maybe when this cycle crashes I might throw a couple more BTC at alts... we shall see.

I am 'willing' to pay the fees, but its more like I'm fucking forced to else I just have a coin stuck in a wallet. 
It is not a good user experience and competition is heating up.  
...It clearly needs more capacity and pretty fucking soon, or you will find a lot of people leaving for alts.

Its ridiculous, one of their childish rants spilled out onto r/all the other night. 
I get their perspective, and would be happy to incorporate some of that spirit into the scaling solution.
But they are so hard line its stupid. 
Worse still, they are all divesting into alts!
Instead of compromise they would prefer to see Bitcoin burn to the ground. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:58:39
ha ha ha... really it would take an age to explain it all.
All I can say is, the price of a few coins is worth the admission alone to the amount of drama you get in the world of Crypto. 
Just make sure you buy in when we are not at the top of a hype phase.

I have no idea what tax agencies do in your country.
Most exchanges these days require ID and address etc. so its not outside of the realm of possibility that they could monitor your transactions there.
Again, I don't know if banks report to agencies if you get sudden large transactions deposited to your account. 
I think it would be kind of naive in this day and age to assume they cant see the transfers going into your account, should they target you for an audit. 
Best advice is to learn what tax rate you are liable for and pay it!
You could also look into tax inefficiencies... for example the annual tax allowance in the UK renews in April. So you would sell some in March and Some in April should the profits be over your allowance. 
In the UK you are allowed up to 11k capital gain before tax is due. 
There may be a similar allowance in your country.

Essentially, your private key is never exposed to a machine which is exposed to the internet. A machine which could have malware.

We will get our resolution to the scaling debate soon enough. 
We don't want centralized control from a small group who unwind the blockchain when they risk financial loss. 
LN is ideal for commerce. 
Monero, Zcash might have small niches... but they will never be popular enough to compete with Bitcoin. If I want Monero, I can just trade in and out of it.
Ethereum has plenty of its own problems... rapidly bloating blockchain and the whole thing ground to a snail pace during one of the ICO's yesterday.

What is your solution then? A blocksize increase in 6 months plus will be too late. Bitcoin will be an alt by then. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:48:13
Yes, this is what has happened. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:40:44
OK, then yes... technically I imagine Crypto assets are harder for Government agencies to track purely because they are so new. 
However, It has the same ramifications as if you hid physical assets or income. The tax implications and legal ramifications are exactly the same. 
They are no doubt getting up to speed on tracking all of this though, so in the future they may know that you send x$ to an exchange and bought Bitcoin with it. 
If you get paid in Crypto your employer should pay your taxes. 
They could be audited and funds will be seen leaving their bank account.., which they will have to justify. 
Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:18:03
How many of those are absolute pump and dump scams though?
I saw one for a decentalized dating website!?
It's basically people knocking up a decent website, having a white paper and trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist (in a lot of cases).
Then swapping ethereum for their own made up currencies which are then bought up immediately by some whales and sold on for a profit on yet another market.
I can see some interesting ideas... But it's like the .com bubble only not regulated!!
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:03:39
We are at the top of a massive run ... basically parabolic. 
Previous moves like this have resulted in pretty severe crashes. 
The scaling issue isn't resolved... and all hell could break loose. 
**You would have to be a crazy fucking lunatic to invest in something like this.** 
Saying that, you may never see Bitcoin as cheap as it is at the moment... and if its successful it is going to reach 10's of thousands per coin.
Quite a difficult choice isn't it :)

As a simple set up, you could install electrum on a CLEAN computer. A fresh install of Windows / Linux would be ideal. 
Failing that make sure you have windows updated and a decent antivirus. 
Make sure you write down your seed words at least twice and keep them safe away from thieves... ideally in two separate locations. 
Give electrum a good password.. and remember it!!!
Use the options within Elecrum to backup your wallet. 
If you want you can export your private keys to a usb stick (make sure its clean!). And store it somewhere safely. Ideally encrypted... but remember your password.

Don't do it mate, you are borrowing money to invest.
Bitcoin has lost half its value a few times in the past. 
Get to work, save up, and come back in a few years. In the meantime keep reading about the subject so when you're ready you will be fully informed.
This is not a money making scheme and everyone is guessing as to the future price.

I would be happy with that yes... however, the miners and (an unknown number of the community) wont be. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:53:55
I think Segwit alone probably made sense when it was thought of. Conservative, low risk growth. However, usage has exceeded that now. So bigger blocks are probably needed too.
The biggest problem was dividing the community into different forums... Then everyone labels the other team, and resentment grows.
 We all want bitcoin to succeed, so we need to stop acting like dick's... All of us.
This can also be seen with us labelling alts as shit coins. People love their alts! We should love them too.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:11:18
Good strategy! Its easy to get bogged down with trying to time it... in the big picture it doesn't matter at all does it!
Since 2013 I just stayed in coins and forgot about it all. 
Really should be accumulating when its not in the news. 
I wonder if there will be a period like that again!
Have you been getting in on any Eth / Alt action?
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:44:57
It's not my argument.
Segwit leads to off chain transactions with things like the lightening network.
Those transactions will be free so miners get no transaction fee.
If they just have bigger blocks, they keep getting all the fees.

@_date: 2017-06-03 16:00:37
The rush is because we are all getting pissed off paying $5 to send Bitcoin anywhere. The payment processors like Bitpay are switching to alts. Ethereum will be No.1 in a few short months.
And people will leave Bitcoin in droves waiting for everyone to become 'comfortable'. (which is never going to happen). 
Segwit is ready to go. We can have a blocksize increase later. 
Most rational people are comfortable with that.

Personally? I'd cash out 25% - 50% of that. 
Start a pension or buy a few all market funds. 
Pay off all loans and credit cards... get an emergency fund. 
Buy some smart clothes, a gym membership, a deposit on a flat perhaps? Invest in yourself ... study  etc.
Hate to say it but your sexual market value goes up if you have some money. 
Bitches wont be classing your Bitcoins as money though... in fact don't even tell them about it. 
Its a nice sum of money... its not an amount you can retire on. 
However, you are only 22 so if you don't wank it away it should set you up nicely in life.
I repeat DO NOT WANK IT AWAY! Its easy to get carried away with a sudden windfall. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:23:36

And pretty true, I thought I made out like a bandit in the 2013 bubble. I cringe at how many coins I got rid of!
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:17:52
Oh, sorry! Well, by alt coins... Ethereum in particular. 
Its leaching off us. If you have swapped some Bitcoin over to Eth in the last month you have done very well!
Its attacking as they are trying to become the no.1 coin in terms of market share. Its all bullshit as market cap doesn't mean a great deal. 
But it would be a blow to Bitcoins rep if they achieve it. 
Personally.... I think they are about to tank harder than Bitcoin. 
Not 100% sure though... depends where all the money from the alts goes when those bubbles deflate. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:55:47

I think the only possible way that would happen is a world consensus of governments to ban it. Or a collusion of banks banning the transfer of fiat to exchanges.
When have world governments ever agreed on anything?
Also, what it's the likelihood of all banks starting to tell customers what they can and can't spend their money on.
Not to mention, bitcoin has legal status in many countries already (Japan for example).

Thanks for that troll. As far as I can see ethereum is just a load of promises in the future, used to buy junk tokens in ico's from groups with just a white paper and a fancy website. The whole thing is a massive scam.
Saying that, I've got some and will be flippening back to Bitcoin when you meet your ridiculous market share goal temporary. 
Market share doesn't mean much when just a handful of people are hodling and dreaming of Lamborghinis. It's going to crash spectacularly.

Its just not an interesting coin to me and the returns have been much better on BTC. 
I have a few Ethereum, but i'm still not convinced by it. It all looks over-hyped with scammy ICOs. 
Monero ... maybe, for some use cases. I don't want to risk holding a huge amount of it though. 
The problem with (shitcoins ;) is that there are too many of them!
I would say we are in a big crypto hype cycle... and when it crashes alts will have it worse than Bitcoin as people 'fly back to quality' so to speak.

I didn't like the way the team rolled back their blockchain too preserve their own wealth. If it happened before, why not again.
Also, there's a massive attack surface, and the only use case appears to be buying pump and dump tokens from dodgy ICOs.

Whatever grandad... Bitcoin is the MySpace of currency.
You can now buy a new coin which is a virtual machine on the blockchain (or something)...
I don't really care... It's market cap is exploding!
I've no idea how many coins they are releasing, but as long as that market cap keeps rising I'm happy.
With my ethereum I can spend it on ICO's. Most of which have amazing ideas! They are going to decentralize everything, and we all know decentralizing everything is massively important.
The white papers and websites look cool...I trust these people.
Most don't have functioning services yet... But I don't care. They have given me their own currencies in exchange for my ethereum which I exchanged my bitcoin for.
Complicated? Sure. But everyone should just pile in to this gold rush.
Don't worry about the size of the ethereum blockchain, or the fact they rolled it back once to benefit the leaders and the wealthy.

The narrative on this sub at the time was very much "it's got no inflation cap" , "it's not a currency" and "it's vapour ware".

@_date: 2017-06-03 17:28:24
The community is already split. 
As I said, the only solution is to activate Segwit as Ethereum will be beating BTC market cap in the coming weeks/months.
Once that happens, that amazing 40 billion market cap will shrink rapidly as Bitcoiners easily switch to Ethereum; which doesn't charge $5 (and rising) fees to use.
A lot of people are getting tired of the endless debates... especially as the solution is painfully obvious. Segwit then a Blocksize increase! 
Once Ethereum catches Bitcoin, the press and buzz will be on fire, and incoming investment will be driven to Ether.
Bitcoin will forever be a relic slowly drifting down the tables. 
The Myspace and Netscape of crypto... just because fundamentalist on both sides wont reach an obvious solution.

@_date: 2017-06-10 14:59:13
If they had wanted to crush it, they would have done it by now. They also wouldnt have sold seized coins off in auctions over the years. 
However, even if one Government did want to ban it... tough shit... this is a Global currency. 
Bitcoin is actually fairly traceable compared to other coins such as Monaro or Zcash. If you buy drugs, there is a permanent record in the blockchain going from your address to the dealers address. 
They just have to link your name to your address, which is fairly trivial considering most exchanges need ID these days. 
The only way they could ban it really, is at the choke points of getting your cash to an exchange. Some banks in the UK do this. 
However, they probably know that this is an age of massive innovation and change. So, they dont really want to ban it for fear of being left behind. 
Does it weaken their own currency? Not really... most of us here are just HODLing. If it got big enough, ...maybe. Especially for countries which are trying to impose capital restraints on currency leaving their country. 
As for tax... same as anything else. It is up to YOU to report your tax liability. 
If you are being paid in Bitcoin, it is your employers responsibility to pay your taxes. Just the same as if you were being paid cash.

If it succeeds, uncertainty reduces and there would be a massive fast upswing.
As you can probably tell by today's price action, Bitcoin is fucking bonkers and reacts in seemingly random ways. 
For all we know it could keep climbing until aug 1st. 
As the saying goes Honey Badger don't care. 
Saying that, we could also be at $1000 on aug 1st so I dont know.

If I just want to move funds from point a to b or have a store of value, I want the currency to be specialist in that respect. I don't need bells and whistles and a massive attack surface. Not to mention the threat of one of those fancy contracts locking up my funds! Ha
Granted, the scaling issue hasn't been great... But I guess the price you pay for not having a leader. Your leader whilst good for rapid development is a weak point too. Will the sec go after him when thousands of people lose their shirts in those ridiculous ICO's?
Sure, there are a couple of interesting ideas... I've seen nothing world changing though.
The main problem you guys have is the concentration of wealth... Those guys sat on hundreds of thousands are going to get itchy trigger fingers when the price stagnates, when the ICO rip off artists decide to cash out, and us bitcoiners who've been profiting off this decide to sell.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:04:45
...but I've only seen one or two decent looking ideas which get eaten up within minutes. 
There's a ton of shit on there. 
I wont be pouring my money into it! ha
No regulation and securities being issued in the multiple millions will mean people are going to lose their shirts. The majority of start ups fail.
The SEC will probably get involved and regulate the shit out of it... and possibly prosecute a few people. 
Don't believe the hype.

Bitcoin is an anti-fragile beast and wont think twice about crashing just to pull Ethereum through the shit for a while.

Only problem is, as Ethereum has had a more meteoric rise... it can have a more catastrophic fall. 
The presale was only 3 years ago, so you have got a lot of Bitcoiners who bought Ethereum.
They are master Hodlers... but are now sat on $100's of thousands of dollars. If it starts slipping heavily the market could dive hard.

1. Not storing that value very well at the moment... its dropping like a stone. 
And as much as I'd like to see Bitcoin as a digital version of Gold... I still hate having to pay $5 (and rising) fees to send any. Especially considering competitive coins will do that for basically free. 
2. I'm getting so bored of the scaling debate, I'm tempted just to leave Bitcoin completely. I even swapped some of my coins for Eth recently. 
Its a fairly basic and trivial decision which has paralyzed us, and allowed the competition to very nearly overtake. 
This is a winner takes all game if you ask me... if we don't buck our ideas up, we'll be the alt coin soon.

Mate everyone wishes they bait like bought more back then. 
Virtually every single coin (exempting newly mined ones) probably had multiple stories of people who regret letting go.
In ten years you may deeply regret not picking some up today.
You may also be glad you didn't.
No guarantees in this game in afraid.

Don't count out the Honey Badger just yet... he's anti fragile.
 
He fucking laps up bear markets for fun!
 Lets see how you Lambo dreaming pretenders cope with a 60%+ crash. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:15:12
I guess, could you find out for me?
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:09:49
Losing market share... does that count as status quo?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:03:30
Best alternative should they not remove this shit?
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:12:19
You could read it like that I guess... 
Perhaps I should have said 'perfectly tracks' ;) 
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:13:23
Cheers, I decided against it anyway!
Really getting fucked off with $5+ fees just for moving my funds around though. 
Cant even be bothered to buy any more. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:11:11
Really? The best plan at at three moment seems to be split the chain in two. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:50:56
Do you not think that Roger Ver is profiting massively from the alt coin boom?
@_date: 2017-06-05 04:02:41
What a load of shit. We're all so fucked off with spending $5 for a transaction we've stopped spending unless absolutely necessary.... That's really helpful! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:01:51
Let's just do Segwitx2 on July 21st. 
It's a healthy compromise with both Segwit and a block size increase.
It's an absolute no brainer to me!!!!
Both sides largely get what they want.
I bet bitcoin skyrockets if it gets accepted.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:46:16
"as I wait for delivery"
They are on back order for a month or so.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:43:48
I've read articles there where they are pro bitcoin. 
They just want to raise emotions in you so you post it elsewhere... like you did! ha
Utter trash site though... the comments are hilarious. Full of gold and silver bugs who have been holding a bag for the last few years and largely hate Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:16:54


Good fucking lord. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 15:55:21
Yes. Bitcoin will be passed by Ethereum if we wait 6 months. It will become an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:59:25
What do they do when this happens?
Send you a letter and ask you for another bank account to send your funds to?
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:13:43


You don't really want that if you're securing a milti billion dollar asset. 
I like the fact that a small group of people cant rewind the blockchain because they could lose money. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:31:27
Sooner... please
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:20:18
Fuck your mother if you want fuck
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:02:37
They are such dumbasses. I imagine a large number of Eth holders are bitcoiners!! Ha
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:26:21
How come those studies haven't been done yet then? It's not like we haven't had enough time. 
The competition are about to take over.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:03:29
Of course not mate, its a perfectly valid concern if you have money at stake. 
At the moment we simply dont know how the market will react as it comes closer to Aug 1st. 
My hope is that a resolution appears before then. 
If you do sell before, and a resolution occurs, you could be chasing the price up and end up with less Bitcoin.
Conversely all of the uncertainty could push the price down. 
Nobody knows which way it will go yet. Its quite the conundrum! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:56:36
1) Still no God Damn scaling solution &amp; fees are pissing users off. 
2) Jihan being a dick
3) US congress going 1984 on Crypto
4) Sentiment changing for Ethereums ICO's (looking very scammy)... contagion spreads to BTC.
Oh yea, and
5) The obvious Bubble we're in
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:07:23
Correct, I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. I'm just hoping if I shout long enough, Someone might actually do something.
 Looks like nobody has experience of project planning at the moment though.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:18:51
"today’s close"... this isn't a stock Golman. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:00:12
Ha cheers, I honestly don't have a problem with Eth... I bloody bought some!
It just gets annoying reading all the "flippening" posts and seeing the cross posting telling us that "Rome is Burning" etc. etc. 
The competition has been good for both sides as these things are built on hype!
Looks like we're both crashing now... the press will say were both dead. 
We'll consolidate... Bitcoin will get a scaling solution, you guys will hopefully get Raiden and Sharding sorted... and we'll do an even crazier ride in the future!! ha
Or some other coin will come along out of nowhere, and we'll have to join forces or something.  
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:44:03
Mate, the underground is switching to anonymous coins now. 
They don't use Bitcoin anymore.. the ledger is too transparent. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:39:42
I care man. 
U/bitcoiniac is a modern day Nostradamus. 
You show respect.  
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:12:36
One group believes the way to scale is through bigger blocks only.
This is how bitcoin has scaled to date.
This is also how Satoshi  envisioned it in the white paper.
The other group believes continually bigger blocks will lead to increased centralisation.
They believe that off chain scaling is the best way forward so have built as tested Segwit. This will fix a few things and give an effective block size increase. It is a conservative approach which does not require a hard fork.
It's all complicated by things like ASIC boost, power gabs, business interests, censorship of forums, greed and ideological beliefs.
Possibly with a helping of toxic bad actors mixing up this complete shit show.
And a ton of us idiots who believe we know the best way forward.
(My view has flip flopped on the matter a few times)
Divide and conquer is a great strategy to unseat bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:30:56
How do I do this with coins already in my electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:04:44
Don't you're giving me PTSD. 
I saw a tweet about china banning Bitcoin at the absolute peak of that. I sold everything! 
I then panic bought back IN at 1100.... and rode that bad boy all the way down :)
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:13:56
Ledger Nano and Trezor seem to be the top two. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:22:08
You're probably gonna fuck up and get deeper under water. Just come clean with them. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:07:58
As much as I like LiteCoin, I don't see it as a successor to Bitcoin. 
Good luck to you though!
Should still catch a nice bump if UASF does fail.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:03:47


There is going to be a coin of this now? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:38:48
I guess it sucks trying to figure out when (if) I should jump ship... and which ship to jump too. Maybe cash is king in this scenario. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:25:03
That's not their goal
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:59:57
I was thinking about organising an 'Order 66'... So we all sell this crap if they manage to achieve the flippening they all have a hard-on for.
I'm getting sceptical that they can get to $500 though. Ethereum is really concentrated in people's hands, so it's only the noobs who are pushing the price up.
Those few are now sat on large sums of money, and are likely to be getting itchy trigger fingers now.
They can't take bitcoin down, even when it's in the slightly weakened state it's in now.
This post has made me realise that it's best to sell before that though.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:28:00
Ok, not even mini, crypto universe versions?
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:59:15
Surely they are most opposed to it because it leads to off chain transactions.
As well as asicboost.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:44:28
Ok, but if the miners are happy with it, and most regular users would be happy with Segwit and a blocksize increase... What's the problem?!
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:24:52
Yes, you're assuming ethereum is a ticking time bomb. The problem is the ease at which people can switch. I've bloody bought some and I hate ethereum!
It's like there's no choice though. 
Bitcoin is just ripping itself apart over such a trivial point.
How hard can it be to activate Segwit and have a blocksize increase!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:18:39
Ha ha... just hope they don't pin that shit on Bitcoin!
Just another day at the office for Bitcoiners :) 
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:15:56
OK, two bubbles in 2013 then... I have definitely lived through two bubbles which crashed horribly since 2013. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:28:26
You don't think people will just jump onto the one that's about to take over? 
I've bought some ethereum already, and I fucking hate them.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:02:50
How will they get our brain wallets?
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:24:37
I think it's the money involved. It amplifies emotions. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 04:27:46
You think it's possible they are under Chinese state control?
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:19:49
Whats your plan then? Are you staying with the status quo? Jumping ship, or switching to fiat?
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:16:58
Oh God, I hope that's not the next area of contention
@_date: 2017-06-11 12:16:37
What if nobody wants it!!!
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:23:13
First on the list.
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:49:25
We're tight... I don't need to upvote him with fake internet Karma.
