If you sell in the dip you will always loose. Just wait and buy when dip is over. Then set your target sell and sell it, even if you dont achieve the maximum price.
That's it.

I have 5 rigs, all with 8x rx580 and 5x 1080ti.
One of them i use as my daily computer.
All you have to keep in mind is this:
To regular use you need at least one strong CPU i7 7700 7th gen (the board i use is asrock h110 and does not support 8th intel cpu)
Things you cannot do while mining:
- watch youtube/facebook videos
- use photoshop or illustrator or any other using gpu redenring 
- use chrome with gpu hardware acelaration
- any other video aplication that use GPU resources.
Besides this, trading, web analysis, you can do without loosing hashpower.
When i check my 24h haspower, the rig i use looses ~5 to 10H/s to the others wich is not significant for me.
About the people who complains that does not worth to mine nowadays, they are totally long because you have to think about the long run.
Even mining Ether or Monero, in 1 year Eth rill be more then 1k and Monero more then 500$, so you will get all your money back. But, for this, you need to believe and have faith in crypto, something that i am totally comintment.
PS: I dont pay electricity ;)
