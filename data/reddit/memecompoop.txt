Have any screenshots or just claims? I've never heard of support at Moolah taking more than 30 minutes to reply to an e-mail. Plus, they have a chat box that pops up now for instant communication.

He could have described it as an "Electronic Monkey," but that doesn't make it a monkey. He can call it whatever he wants, but it will be treated and used as a commodity as long as it is deflationary.

I summoned some of the users I know who are part of Moolah in another comment, so we'll see if they can help you out or let you know where things are at in your inquiry.

Thanks for posting screenshots. So you haven't heard anything since these went thru? Any idea how many orders were in for the higher prices. I know I've seen a lot of orders for really small volumes. Is it possible that someone beat you to a sell order and it wiped out all of the higher prices before you completed yours? I know I've had that happen to me before.  
I think moolah and prelude are legit, but their biggest problem is lack of volume.

Yeah, I first started looking into it a $25 and passed because everything I read said it was a bubble about to pop.
