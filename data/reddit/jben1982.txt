Great news. Since steam was basically all I used my cc for I just shredded it. Feels good to be free! 
@_date: 2016-04-05 04:04:59
This will forever change the world of commerce, we are standing at the foot of the mountain and staring up at something great. 
Step aside Amazon, you are a has been. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 04:08:38
That does not look very reassuring. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:03:07
The American government... and the cronies propping them up... they all belong in prison. 
I think it's high time for the oppressed to rise up and reclaim our freedom. We will prevail. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:48:39
Sent a email. Will send a few more tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-06-29 10:56:57
If we don't push Greece we are delaying global adoption. This is our chance. 
We must take it. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 11:49:34
VIVA BITCOIN, END THE SLAVE STATE. 
THE PEOPLE WILL PREVAIL.

The American government... it THRIVES on violence... 
It uses violence to control. Do you really think they would let the man who pledged to remove violence to remain free?
No. That would be AGAINST their best interests. They needed Ross out of the equation. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:29:29
We should NOT be negotiating with terrorists. 
We should NOT be begging for mercy from terrorists. 
We SHOULD be crushing the terrorist government with the strongest force so that it may never arise again. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:31:13
I see the buttcoiners are brigading hard today. Why don't you crawl back from whence you came? 
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:39:48
Everything. Bitcoin is a means to end this state terrorism.
@_date: 2015-05-23 09:46:26
We need an armed revolution and we need it fast. We CANNOT allow citizens to be terrorized like this.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:49:38
Are you selling these? In bitcoin of course... 
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:47:19
Fuck GrubHub. Free market baby, will gladly see them crash and burn.
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:33:58
Fuck the government, the time has never been better for a revolution.
@_date: 2015-05-20 03:31:41


Much like the pic of the core devs :)
@_date: 2015-05-14 08:02:13
This. This IS it. This is going to be massive. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:59:31
Fuck the American government. I cannot wait for the day it crumbles and burns to ashes. 
People will look back at Ross Ulbricht as the man who turned the tide. He is being crucified now but he WILL be remembered.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:43:24
Fuck the government. We seriously need a revolution on a global scale. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:45:02
Damn right. I'll never understand why liberals support their own oppressors. A classic example of Stockholm Syndrome if there ever was one. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:39:46
I can't wait till this statist system collapses. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:31:03
Bitcoin's functionality really leaves speechless sometimes :) This would not have been achievable with statist banks. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:36:38
Just don't speak to them. Fuck the police.
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:02:38
Yet another shitty fiat currency crashes in flames to the ground.
Bitcoin WILL emerge victorious.
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:08:35
B b but bitcoin is stagnating! Bitcoin is dead /s
@_date: 2015-05-14 08:00:46
This is massive for bitcoin :) 
I'm so excited right now :) 
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:38:40
Yep. My bitcoin is in my brain, the most powerful weapon against this terrorist government. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 08:49:21
The next few months will be very interesting :) I'm buying up atm
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:32:02
Fuck the statist thieves. WE WON'T LIE DOWN. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:16:35
Because the expectation is a price of $1000+
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:24:37
Fuck New York, they will forever be stuck in the 20th century. Bunch of antiqued, bank loving criminals. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:42:49
It's the statists and their pointless love for bureaucracy. 
Communism at its best ladies and gentlemen. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:37:06
This is only the beginning of the revolution, if I were you I'd stick around :) governments will topple.
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:59:40
Preach brother. I stopped using scamcards last year and couldn't be happier. 
Fuck the thieves, fuck the banks, fuck the government. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:07:02
Mass adoption is happening :) I'm stocking up on the cheap coins. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:41:30
Pipe down son, the world wouldn't be able to function as is without IT. He can do as he pleases, he's earned it. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:27:17
Cheap coins, I'm stocking up :)
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:57:20
Content creators should ideally distribute their content free of charge and then put up a donation address. This will eliminate the shady middlemen and I can guarantee that they will end up making more money. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:15:55
FUCK THE BANKS, FUCK THE GOVERNMENT. 
POWER TO THE PEOPLE. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:25:49
Yep :) 
My dollar cost average is $630. I have a feeling we will be passing that within the next month. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:13:52
Coins are cheap as hell now, I'm stocking up. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 03:52:58
Bitcoin is happening :) 
The masses are waking up :) 
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:11:34
FUCK. THE. GOVERNMENT. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:41:36
Your parents are clueless. 
Do you have a way to access your passport and your parents credit card? 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:03:00
Another massive use case, bitcoin really is taking off :) 
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:24:11
Just bought 7 bitcoins (7 is my lucky number). 
This is it gentlemen. 
THIS. IS. IT. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:29:32
The mods have a pro-Israeli agenda. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:08:43
There are hidden agents... trying to destroy bitcoin from the inside... 
We must root them out and eradicate them. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:26:32
FUK THE GOVERNMENT. steeling pieces of shit, bitcoin really is the answer 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:01:24
I sent an email as well :) 
Will send again tomorrow :) 
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:05:37
Banks will die out with this last generation of technologically incompetent baby boomers. What we are seeing now is an obsolete criminal industry in its death throes. 
Power to the people. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:12:16
I've got my bug out bag packed with my AR-14 on the side. 
It's time for the uprising, just give the signal. 
I'M FUCKING PUMPED. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:32:01
How long has Apple been around for? 
How long has bitcoin been around for? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:27:19
It was never gone :) 
The fundamentals remained. Code doesn't bow to human emotions. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:14:26
Fuck yeah this is world history's most significant revolution, the one that will remove our shackles. 
We will rewrite the way humans live. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:29:16
Fuck the EU. 
People from there should convert to BTC ASAP before they lose it all. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:02:02
Satoshi needs to come back and provide us with guidance. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 04:53:22
Good. Fuck Ellen Pao and her fascist cronies. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:26:39
Please keep your pump and dump scamcoins out of K thx bai. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:27:48
Go back to @_date: 2015-07-12 14:29:24
When you are paid in statist dollars do you feel safe? 
Your bank is far less secure than even the weakest BTC wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:23:20
Mass adoption is happening :) 
Time to stock up whilst the coins are still cheap :) 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:18:20
Do a little research. You never own USD, the government can take it whenever they please. 
Therefore USD is NOT a secure form of money. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:34:25
BOOM BOOM BOOM
*who is that?*
BOOM BOOM BOOM
*this is us*
BOOM BOOM BOOM
*the bitcoin revolutionaries*
BOOM BOOM BOOM
**Here to tear your septic statist empire to the FUCKING GROUND**
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:11:50
There are hidden agents... trying to destroy bitcoin from the inside... 
We must find and eradicate them. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 11:19:37
Get fucked statist. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:20:12
Great to hear :) 
Perhaps we should have a weekly thread to share how many non-believers we've managed to convert :) 
@_date: 2015-07-20 15:57:13
Well said. Credit cards are obsolete. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 04:47:51
This is amazing, this will change the way we think about the bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:30:04
This is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 04:26:02
Yep, feel really sorry for all the credit card users :) 
FUCK THE GOVERNMENT FUCK THE BANKS 
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:33:10
I'd like to put my bitcoins into their wallets of you know what I mean ;) 
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:31:23
Fuck yeah it's happening. Time to stock up on some cheap coins ;) 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:05:46
This is why I'm hodling :) 
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:48:23
They can try to fight us but it is futile... for they are a diseased limb that must be removed so that the organism can survive... 
@_date: 2015-04-30 07:54:15
You are a slave to the state. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:43:32
There's a clear anti-bitcoin agenda RIGHT across reddit. 
I'm surprised you've only noticed that now. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:57:11
Thank you Satoshi, you have irrevocably changed my life :) 
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:11:26
Fuck Ripple. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:52:04
The Ross Ulbricht trial was a mock trial. Its sole purpose was to steer attention away from the statist criminals. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:18:30
Something needs to be done. There needs to be a revolution. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:40:18
Sounds like a good idea, would love to see it implemented. 
IMO this is the beauty of bitcoin. It allows so many new possibilities to be explored. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:52:26
I love it when I hear stories of other bitcoiners sharing this amazing innovation with others :) 
Here, share the love 50 bits
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:46:14
Wow just went over to for the first time. What a fucking sad bunch of haters. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:16:06
Can't wait to try this :) 
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:20:05
Keep strong and don't let the shills bother you. I upvote every positive post because there are certain elements who are trying to destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:21:41
Confirmation times aren't a problem with bitcoin. 
Remember credit cards have a confirmation time of 6 MONTHS. Bitcoin is 10 mins. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:35:23
Yes a lot of medication is horrifically overpriced by big pharma companies and the like. If there were an anonymous marketplace where one could purchase cheap medication I would definitely use it. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:58:16
100 bits 
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:48:35
This is going to be bitcoin's killer app. I cannot wait :)
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:43:27
This comment is being brigaded by the obsessed no-lifes over at @_date: 2015-04-28 12:18:31
This post has made me proud to be part of the revolution :) 
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:35:15
Surprised you only realised this now. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:55:45
This is really good news. Big thanks to the guys at Overstock for keeping faith in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:21:45
Why on earth would you want to pay tax on your bitcoins in the first place? The government has no idea of my bitcoins and they have no way of checking if I actually own any. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 08:09:25
Don't miss it the second time :) 
I'm putting everything I have into bitcoins. The first thing I do when I get paid is buy some coins xD
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:42:36
Fuck yeah! 
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:20:11
But I thought the bitcoin community is toxic and a horrible place to be. /s
@_date: 2015-04-13 05:03:34
Fuck PayPal. It's just scam after scam after scam. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:35:46
Yep I know what you are talking about. I burnt my credit cards a year ago and haven't looked back. Bitcoin ftw. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:14:34
Thanks for this. Bitcoin is amazing :) 
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:14:57
Time to free Ross and lock up the real criminals. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 11:05:23
Admins are you listening??? 
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:22:38
Welcome! Bitcoin is a game changer and in 100 years we will look back in awe at this amazing invention :) 
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:10:00
This isn't a bitcoin problem, this is a fiat problem. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:24:53
This is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:48:06
Anecdotes like this just reinforce my belief that bitcoin's success is inevitable. 
Glad to hear you enjoyed your trip as well :) 
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:25:47
It always astonishes me how many people fail to see the potential of bitcoin. If you just take a second and think about it you realize how revolutionary it is and how it will change the world as we know it forever :) 
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:57:45
Bitcoin's killer app :) 
@_date: 2015-09-18 11:41:13
True. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 04:59:03
He's a scam artist. I'm glad he's left cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 10:53:09
This place is filled with shills and sock puppet accounts. Some want to steer bitcoin in a certain direction and some governments and banks want to destroy it. 
I've got an excel spreadsheet with hundreds of suspected shill accounts listed in it. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 03:47:58
Fuck paypal.
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:19:00
Holy shit this is literally going to change the way the world handles money. This is going to allow Africans and Asians to have banking functionality at the tip of their fingers. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 06:09:22
Holy shit this is something I hadn't considered: the ability to set up micro-nations and communes using and running on bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:31:36
THIS has got to stop. trolls need to be stopped. 
Mods. Why aren't you taking action? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:32:16


I'd like to see them try. There's no way any government official will ever touch my coins. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:59:34
Awesome! 
@_date: 2016-10-01 06:27:45
Does the lightning network exist? 
@_date: 2015-04-24 14:27:08
Bitcoin is the biggest innovation in the financial sector in the past century it's most definitely not a fad. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:15:24
This is corruption, plain and simple. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 09:25:15
Well done :) 
Nice to see people adopting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 08:10:52
Damn, bitcoin adoption is happening crazy fast atm :) 
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:00:29
Fuck Mastercard and friends, bunch of thieves.
Bitcoin is the future :) 
@_date: 2015-11-27 05:52:00
I'd take the opinion of someone with a degree in economics with a large pinch of salt. They are indoctrinated to support the state. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:55:30
Low price so people are stocking up. I myself bought a few coins today, brought my dollar cost average down quite a bit :) 
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:06:41
Who would've guessed that the government is filled with corrupt criminals huh? 
@_date: 2015-11-22 05:04:36
BOOM BOOM 
BOOM BOOM 
hear that? It's the sound of war drums... 
Bitcoin is at war and we WILL prevail against evil. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:57:44
That old story again. No evidence of that happening. Not one conclusive shred. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:54:45
That's horrible :(
Ross must feel so helpless, locked up against his will. 
Just goes to show what the government can and will do to you if you dare go against the grain. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:06:20
Yeah sadly. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:39:30
I'm stocking up :) 
This is gentlemen. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 05:09:14
Truer words have not been spoken. Hope these groups have good opsec, otherwise they will be getting hauled away a la DPR. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:08:54
It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out. The next few months may be very significant for bitcoin.
