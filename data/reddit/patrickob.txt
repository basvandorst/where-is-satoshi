We're going to circle back with our legal advisers on this because we take this kind of thing very seriously. What you have to realize is that this is not different from what current exchanges do. It's also extremely presumptuous to believe we're ignoring US laws and pretending it's Canadian law while intending to operate in the US. We are engaged with lawyers and are doing our due diligence. In the meantime we'll remove this paragraph since it's already copied here for people to see, but we don't want to mislead others if any part of it is not true. We'll sort this out, thank you for pointing it out and being on guard for the Bitcoin community.

I think it's possible, but I don't imagine it would function too efficiently. You'd probably have to issue collateral to the opposing party through the banking system, and there's no assurances you'd get the money back after the trade. Maybe there are other strategies, I haven't thought too much about it, but it does appear to be a very challenging problem.

Can't give a specific date at the moment unfortunately. In regards to the wallets, you will use the Tetra wallet built into the app or website, and this is client side so you can be sure of its security. The reason for this is to make the user flow less cumbersome for users.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:46:33
It's a bit confusing, whilst you are correct in the fact that we are a centralized service we operate using a decentralized transaction model so that we never have control over users coins directly (and thus hackers do not have access to users coins). To add to the confusion the verified transaction model works a bit differently as well in the sense that we can route payments through our banking infrastructure to absolve businesses of legal risk relative to the money transmitter licensing requirements, but that feature will be one of the last we implement and will take the most time to structure and put in place across the globe (because we'll have to jump through the banking and licensing hoops ourselves). To be honest, I don't really see the need for a completely decentralized solution, they're far less efficient, impose feature restrictions by nature of their implementation, and I think most (if not all) of the same security benefits can be accomplished with a hybrid approach. We just need to utilize the powerful decentralized features of the Bitcoin protocol.

We're attempting to improve on the localbitcoins model, bisq is an attempt to improve on the regular exchange model. They're focusing on coin-to-coin, we're more about fiat-to-coin and coin-to-fiat.

This is something we'll have to look into further, but we're hoping we can come up with a secure strategy for high-risk payment methods. If not, we'll have to either remove the payment method or trial it for a little while to see how it performs.

We can have two of those three things. I'm not sure how important censorship resistance is for something like this though, why would you want to censor an exchange user? It's not a platform for voicing opinions. If you're referring to discrimination then I guess you could say that's a threat of a centralized exchange, but in the same token it makes dealing with scammers a lot easier. There are pros and cons to both approaches, I just don't see the balance for the fully decentralized model for what we're trying to accomplish. It also makes some of the features we want to cover impossible to implement. One of our big goals is to attempt to resolve the issues surrounding money transmitter licensing for localbitcoins (and the like) users. That's just my opinion though, you and others are welcome to disagree. :)

Nothing is impenetrable, it's just a sliding scale of difficulty. When technical attacks fail there is always the option of social engineering based attacks. I would never claim 100% security, that would be dishonest and unrealistic. We can't defend against things like keyloggers and screen capture software, and I'm sure there are sophisticated social engineering approaches that could be taken, which is why I say "very few" opposed to "none". The weaknesses that arise will mostly be a result of people failing to take the necessary precautions, and not the threat of exploits in our code or servers. We will naturally mitigate these problems to our fullest potential, but we can't promise an impenetrable system (as much as we'd like to). We can promise that it's more secure than everything else out there we've seen though, and we personally believe it to be the right direction for future exchanges :). 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:13:45
If forks happen we will have to provide a mechanism for users to get their fork coins out. What that mechanism is yet, I'm not sure, but we will have something in place for it. As for tainting coins, that may be a process you as a user need to go through yourself. We may just provide a seed phrase for you to import into another wallet client for example. I'll have to think more about this one, but something will be possible.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:39:46
If this convenience feature is not something that people desire then we are happy to reconsider it. Our goal was to simplify account management over multiple devices. It's currently a challenge with existing exchange providers, but most of them haven't had to face this challenge yet because they're either: not using a peer-to-peer transaction model, or they only have one client (a desktop app and no phone app for example). The Lykke exchange stores the private keys on the server to avoid having to do this, but we think that is a far inferior approach and one that is susceptible to attacks. In our approach there are very few attack vectors. We never have to store keys, for those who do store keys encryption is rather useless since passwords can be intercepted. We could remove this feature and make it a manual process, but it's more burdensome than it needs to be as far as we are concerned. I'd also add that using the feature would be optional anyway, if you really wanted to go through a manual process you are welcome to, I just see little need for it. Thanks for the feedback.

There's more to security than hash rate.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:59:50
LocalBitcoins provides a level of convenience due to being able to buy from people without investing in the KYC process (usually). This allows you to get coins faster than you would from most other exchanges. If the rate is important to you there are plenty of exchanges you can purchase from, but you'll need to go through the KYC verification process which can take some time, especially when Bitcoin is so hot right now. Have a look into CoinJar and CoinTree, both offer better rates than LocalBitcoins. CoinTree also supports POLi for near instantaneous bank transfers, but your bank needs to support it.

Mixing definitely helps, and for now Bitcoin remains entirely fungible. If people start rejecting transactions because they are *associated* to certain Bitcoin addresses then we can claim that it is not fungible, but to my knowledge that has not happened yet.

The current fee is over $2 if you want your transaction to be confirmed within 24 hours, so it's not really economical at the moment to buy really small amounts. This is being worked on however, so hopefully in the not too distant future small transactions will become feasible.

If both chains persist you will have coins on both chains regardless. You should therefore store your coins in whatever your securest option is. Paper wallets are fairly inconvenient, but if you plan on holding long term then it is a decent option, just make sure you have a backup somewhere off-site. And as mentioned by someone else, phones are not a great place to keep your coins. Very large attack surface.

That's not a how a fee market works. Fees have no ceiling, they will continue to grow as more and more people compete to have their transactions included in the block.


No, if the blocksize limit is not met it will provide one tenth of the current fee revenue, if that.


Not really. 2mb worth of block data in the current climate would equate to 2x the current amount of fee market competition, but if the blocks are increased to 2mb then 2mb worth of block data would equate to the base fee market rate (what we currently have). In other words, there is a lot more profit in fees to be had by *not* increasing the blocksize. You're right about the throughput limitations though.

I really doubt it would be "not for long". Bitcoin is different to Ethereum, Ethereum isn't supposed to be a store of value, it's supposed to be a technology platform. A split there is therefore less contentious, but look at the amount of damage ETC has done and is continuing to do to this day. It's also very confusing to newcomers, "Why don't I want Ethereum Classic instead of Ethereum? It's cheaper". A split will also dilute the value of the main chain, you can't say Bitcoin has the same level of scarcity if the coin cap can be doubled through political manipulation. Sure they're different chains, but try telling that to someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin.

Basic math? It's quite easy to predict how long it will take to exhaust the current block size limitations by looking at the transaction growth of the network, which is basically linear.


No, it doesn't require a non-Core node, Segwit2x is BIP141 compatible. A hard fork would not happen until months after Segwit activates, and that can be readdressed at that time.


Have you heard of coin split? BIP148 is a radical attempt, it is not safe.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:10:39
There's still an incentive, it increases the capacity of the block which allows for even cheaper fees. Increasing the blocksize is not a permanent scaling solution, it's a "kick the can down the road" approach that results in node centralization. SegWit is also not a permanent solution, but at least it opens up avenues for other scaling solutions (LN).
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:53:45

I think you'll find the people who 'want' the Ethereum are speculators. Don't forget that the vast majority of people who own Ethereum only own it because they think it's going to go up in value, it has little to do with utility or idealism. It wouldn't be a bubble if this was investment for utility purposes. Speculation is what makes it a bubble.

I don't see that as unlikely, them owning half of their pools hash rate seems like a fair estimate as far as I'm concerned. 


If their electricity overheads are lower then they're actually saving less from ASICBoost, so I'm not sure why that matters.


It was a generous estimate, if their markup is higher then they're again making even less from ASICBoost -- a larger percentage of their profits would be coming from sales instead of mining.


Regardless of the "amount" being higher their savings are still proportional to their profits. If they own 40% of the total hash power they still only earn a few percent from ASICBoost. Sure, the actual dollar figure will be higher, but it's still a negligible distribution of their profit. Anyway, what gave you that 40% figure? Speaking of guesswork, how'd you calculate that?
At the end of the day the best case scenario is they're making a few percent from ASICBoost. The health of the network (health being subjective) should therefore be a much higher priority for them.

@_date: 2017-06-03 03:59:56


People who run Bitcoin full nodes (that support LN, which should be all of them if using Core software) can collect fees, but they will be far lower than the fees we're currently dealing with due to the throughput capabilities and node competition. This is one of the reasons why Core does not want a blocksize increase, so that when LN is released there will be plenty of decentralized nodes to help secure the network.


Not at all, it's a decentralized extension of the current network. Anyone can run a node (unless the blocksize makes it unfeasible), and all the nodes and the miners of the underlying Bitcoin network work together to secure it.


I can't see why it won't, it's been thoroughly tested for a long time now.

Depends on the client, I'm not sure about others because I use Core and it doesn't auto-update. I'd also be sceptical of clients that do auto-update, I'd consider that somewhat of a security threat. I just think people shouldn't have to be reading Bitcoin news to know whether they **have** to update their clients or risk losing funds. Sure, most people will probably hear about it on the grapevine, but it's still not a great requirement.

@_date: 2017-06-03 02:42:50


It works off an exponential curve that only hits the exponential part when the block becomes full, so it works out being fairly similar -- not 2x. The fees up until the full block are not competitive because why pay a competitive rate when you don't need to because you'll still get your transaction included in the block. 


I agree, I've never liked the idea of a fee market. One of the goals of Bitcoin from the start was to be able to facilitate the unbanked (as Andreas Antonopolous puts it), how can we do that if these people are paying more than their daily wage in a fee? That's not going to work.




It's a tricky question. The heavy resistance to larger blocks stems from efforts to keep Bitcoin nodes as decentralized as possible. The node count is already at a record low and dropping fast, due to the introduction of SPV clients. The Core developers fear a world where only the elite are able to run a node, which poses an obvious security threat. But of course, in the same token, what good is having decentralized nodes if only a small fraction of the world want to use the network because the fees are exorbitantly high. A good balance needs to be had. 
In saying that, scaling through block-size is seen as a dead end from the perspective of the Core developers due to the imposed risks, and that is why they're paving the way for Lightning Network, which will be able to facilitate high throughput and low fees without the centralization component. Miners happen to be pretty resistant to this though, as you can imagine, because fees are a healthy component of their current reward structure. I don't think it's purely money at stake here though, I think a lot of people are vying for control while Bitcoin is still in its infancy. Once it gets larger seizing control will be a lot harder. One of Bitcoin's tenets from the start has been decentralization, so hopefully it can resist takeover attempts, otherwise we may find it becomes significantly less valuable.

This is a fair perspective. Core have proven themselves to want the best outcome for Bitcoin by now, I see no reason why people would not trust their word that a block size increase will take place when it is necessary. It *does* feel like there are other motives at play for the preemptive push for a block size increase, but what those motives may be I'm not entirely certain. Obviously a balance of control, profit and paranoia. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:06:54

You should not compare ETC to a Bitcoin chain split in my opinion. Firstly, Ethereum always has been recognized (officially) as a technology platform, not a store of value or a currency. This gives it more leeway to pull off more risky exercises in the name of innovation. When the ETC/ETH split drama happened a lot of people were able to overlook it by saying "well, this is a technology platform, it's a lot riskier and this is par for the course". Ethereum was also quite young at that point as well, but that didn't stop it from being a highly controversial move.
Bitcoin however, is admired for its stability, security and conservatism (a facet of security). Bitcoin is known to have a 21mil coin cap, and it is seen as a "digital gold". Another Bitcoin chain given ample power would make a mockery out of Bitcoin, it would no longer be seen as a secure store of value among large investors because "what's to stop another chain split happening and further diluting my coins value and inflating the coin supply", and it would muddy the waters immensly. Yes, it won't affect the "real" Bitcoin's coin cap, but people won't see it that way if it reduces the value of their holdings significantly.
People have asked me whether they should buy Ethereum or Ethereum Classic because Classic is cheaper, to say that ETC was a success is missing the mark. All it does is introduce confusion into the ecosystem and provide an asset for people to manipulate by taking advantage of the Bitcoin (or Ethereum) brand. A particular person comes to mind in the case of ETC. It also makes it more frustrating for merchants and businesses to accept. You want to build a Bitcoin exchange? Sorry, you have to build a Bitcoin+BitcoinWhatever exchange to remain competitive and to cover all the "Bitcoin" bases. Now you have to factor that into your design, which ends up being a lot of extra work believe it or not. There are a lot of sound reasons for why having multiple coins would be a horrible outcome, and the fact that Ethereum didn't implode because of ETC is not proof that Bitcoin would not implode because of BitcoinMonarchyCoin.

Not sure I really buy the whole "soft forks are bad because they don't let you have a say in consensus", there is nothing stopping a group of passionate people from hard forking at any point in time if they believe the change to be that damaging to the network. Yes, it will be harder to pull off in an impactful way, but I think that's a good thing because it makes hostile takeover attempts a lot harder and the hard fork will only ever succeed if the change is *really* important. I do however buy the argument that I shouldn't have to worry about frequent hard forks. That should not be something the average person needs to concern themselves with. Bitcoin should just "work". Anything else and it's never going to reach mainstream adoption. One of the big reasons Core has such unanimous support is because we expect them to preserve incentives, not modify them. If they started modifying incentives then I think people would jump ship very quickly.

Bitcoin companies using software that already has SegWit would not be infringing on a patent, unless they made that software themselves, would be my understanding of it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:22:39
Honestly, I'm not too sure. This is all sort of new territory, so how a patent would hold up here is probably up to legal interpretation. Personally I don't think it would be illegal to use a client that infringed on the SegWit patent, only the creators of the blockchain that used SegWit without permission from Blockstream would be the ones held liable. I may be wrong about this though.


Interpretating that, perhaps Blockstream would have legal precedent to tell a Bitcoin company not to use an alternate client using SegWit, however Bitcoin development is decentralized and not controlled by an entity/person/company, so I'm not really sure how they could enforce such a thing.
Also, if the developers of an alternate blockchain or client added SegWit before the 180 notice was given (in the event Blockstream changed their mind and removed the open license) I'm presuming that it would exempt them from any legal action or infringement.

They probably have reinvested a large amount to expand their operation, I don't assume otherwise. Unfortunately we don't know what hash power they started with though.


Yeah, that's a far more reasonable figure. I'm not sure they'd be reinvesting 100% of their profits though -- it'd be very risky to not save any of it. If he was betting on a sure thing perhaps, but there are a lot of outside threats to crypto.
