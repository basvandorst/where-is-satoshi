You are right. There are a lot "problematic" dogs in shelters. That can have a lot of reasons... I should have mentioned  that my post was based on my personal experience I've made with shelters/ organizations in Germany and lots of adopted dogs. My mistake. I can really say I haven't seen any "sugarcoating" when describing the dogs. Because of the reason I mentioned above. Those people tying to find a new permanent home for the dogs. They don't make profit from it. The worst thing is if the owner brings back the dog after a few days/ weeks. They mention how the dogs behaves towards humans, children, other dogs, cats etc. Ofc if it's a dog from the streets history is unknown. But then again, they won't set up the dog for adoption without knowing it/ being able to give information about it.
To reduce the chance in getting dogs which might have experienced bad stuff and evoked bad attitude/ behavior you can also adopt puppies.
Concerning health I must say, if you get pure breeds from not certified/ legit breeders, depending on the race, you almost always gonna have problems -&gt; puppy mills.
Dogs from shelteres I know were very healthy. Puppies and adult ones...

Yea, don't shop - adopt.
Adopting isn't as bad as many people think it is. If it's a legit organization they let you meet the animals a few times so you can get to know your new "family member". They give honest descriptions of the pets too. They don't want people to return their puppy etc. after a few weeks. Main goal is to find a new home for that Animal, not to make profit (like (pet)stores). Mostly pets also come already vaccinated, dewormed, chipped, neutered,.. etc.
