More revenue streams means more incentive for developers who make worthwhile content. Maybe then android users will buy some apps.

Bitcoin will end up being a long term store of value and this will look irrelevant. Reddcoin earns you 5-6% interest per annum just for acting as a node ( Allowing your wallet to act as a node to confirm transactions.) Proof of stake Velocity is the REAL savings account of cryptocurrency. Try it

Research Reddcoin. They have their own Broadcast service and are nearly complete a blockchain based named id system that allows global tipping to a simple name via browser extension.

Make no mistake they ARE worried about Bitcoin althought I doubt thats the reason for the closure.

Bitcoin doesn't change tax policies, it makes them obsolete.

It's the means with which they steal the value from us to inflict their warfare. Elected officials can sign all they want, but if they don't control the means of value then they are limited in that power.

Indeed, most in the first world are well served by their financial services. As we move toward society that has more control over it's value transfer mechanisms, we can stop Governments from stealing from our pockets to wage warfare via printing money. The fundamental trust relationship is being challenged and it's only going to take modest adoption to level the playing field. PGP leaked in a time where exporting crypto of high grade was considered treason. It allowed a world of oppressed voices to get their message out uncensored. The Governement was forced to back off because they couldn't do anything about it. If you care about the things mentioned, it's almost your duty to help this tech be adopted and to not be overly critical of it while it's emerging.

Good call.

Think bigger. Monetary Policy truly for the people by the people. Instead of for warfare by the Federal Reserve. We can usher in an age where authoritarians have less authority.

That may have been to deter big purchases early and keep it in the hands of those who generated with their CPU or GPU like he expected. A corporate buy out was unlikely of what looked like a whale waiting to dump on the game he created.

This is great for so many reasons.

Maybe not with bitcoin the currency no.. but you can use the network to build on top of.

Decentralization is not the revolution.. it's to keep the network redundancy in case a major event.  The fact that no trusted intermediary needs to exist is what produces the altruistic environment that causes businesses to put money into developing the technology it's self. Sure someone could make a centralized token but then they would be regulated to shame and have no incentive to use it over traditional methods.
