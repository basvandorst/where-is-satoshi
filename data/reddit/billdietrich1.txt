Doesn't a deflationary currency discourage purchases/investments of any kind ?  Don't buy renewables or anything else, just hold onto the cash, it will be more valuable next year / prices will be lower next year.

It's foolish to hope that there is some software or tech solution to our political problems.  The first time the software tells people they can't do something they really want to do (go to war, force the price of gasoline down, whatever), they'll bypass or turn off the computer.
This "techie" fantasy dates all the way back to Edison, with his electronic voting mechanism to eliminate filibusters.

Anarchy is not "no government", it is "no hierarchies".  Sort of government by a zillion committees, where anyone affected by a decision has the right to be on the committee that makes that decision.
The right word for "no government" probably is "chaos".  Or maybe "rule by the sword".

Well, except for economies of scale, ease of updating, ease of administration.  Yes, there ARE some benefits of centralization.

It's not just a name problem (and what the heck is a "Facebook", anyway ?).  Good luck getting people off Facebook, LinkedIn, other networks with critical mass (network effect).
Facebook works just fine for people, they don't really care about the exact features, they deal with privacy by not posting really private stuff.  Everyone they want to talk with is on there.

No.  You're not going to get most people off Facebook, and Wikipedia has reached critical mass also.
Most people don't care what the underlying architecture is.  They just want to talk to their family and friends, or get information.  Facebook and Wikipedia work just fine.

I don't think that, but I do think at some point, the US govt will make a digital form of the US dollar, in addition to the current physical and electronic forms of it. Suppose Fed issued, say, $100 billion of US dollar crypto-currency, in addition to the existing US dollar supply ? Best of both worlds: anonymous (maybe), digital, online, easily convertible, guaranteed 1-1 exchange rate with US dollar, backed by US govt.
