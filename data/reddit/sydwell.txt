This should not be a concern. How would the thief know you are about to move your funds? Sooner or later he/she will have to "blink" first and then the game is up. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 16:34:04
Great definitely 2.0++
I have got to questions.
Does deposits have to match?  
And when does bit messaging get "fixed"?
Thanks for all your efforts.

Yep! I definitely agree, establishing some sort of relationship with the "donater" if that word, can be a game changer. We all need think about this because this is what can take bitcoin over the top. What about micropayments? 
My Brainstorm, what if you, say want to donate X amount of Bitcoin a month and every time you like the site visting you automatically donate microbits or even another altcoin to the site(s) you like.

What happened "TO THE MOON"
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:12:06
Main reason why prices are not moving higher; is their is to much friction buying bitcoin. The before the previous bubble phases it was easier to buy Bitcoin. Now you have to a "finced 'ed" bank account slightly problematic in some countries and very difficult in others. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:00:13
Interesting. Yes we need more real world data!
The US has lowest appreciation for mBTC. Maybe having little exposure to the metric system is the issue here?

Thank you!
Blessing to you and your family!
@_date: 2015-05-06 08:25:44
Simple, the more buyer at a price, means more buyers at a higher price.

 I like your first suggestion. But using a  pattern for generating your private keys is **not** on! It only will take a couple possible thousand people using a similar technique and address will be compromised.

Yes, 
But bitcoin with innovation could be totally integrated. For instance allowing seamless incentivation (Yes ChangeTip is great). Currency is just energy flow. The more exchange the better for everyone.

First get a bitcoin wallet. Preferable a offline one. But an online on will also do like one  from blockchain.info.
Create a donation address in your wallet. 
Publish the QR and bitcoin PUBLIC address on your website.
And wait for the funds to roll in..

I think you describing a typically "sidechain" solution that most developers are proposing. The one of difficulties is who or what controls the smart contacts.
Just aside note:
The meta-"coins" are normally refer to as "coloured coins"
