“BTC can literally never be improved” 
Why argue with someone who is so obviously 
1. Trolling 
2. Ignorant
3. Lacking ability to do independent research and would instead rather insult the masses here with blatant disregard for the truth

And after checking u/OriginalFluff previous comments on other subs, you’ll see he just likes to start shit and call people retards.

I don’t think any coins are insured, think it’s just USD.

*******THIS IS THE MOST IGNORANT INCORRECT STATEMENT MADE ON R/BITCOIN*********
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:09:58
It is speculative. I do believe in bitcoin. You are very obviously being a douchey troll; I assume because you and so many people in this day and age lack specific parts of the brain. Regardless, several of your comments have been completely incorrect. Really all you’re doing here is acting as the equivalent to a Facebook grammar nazi. Bitcoin can be upgraded, there are plenty of people who believe in the technology because they have the ability to mentally grasp schnorr sigs, bulletproofs, smart contracts, multi sig wallets, iot, lack of trust in banks, the vulnerabilities of centralized points, and cryptography in general. As someone below posted, reddit does not need to provide free lessons for you just because you are inherently wrong in the things you have said. I implore you to instead use your time to research some of the topics included above. I really hope you see for yourself why bitcoin has reached this point, and why that does to an extent correlate its future. 
The fact that you have this much time to waste spreading misinformation and ignorance gives me reassurance deep down in my bitcoin deity loving heart, that ignorance will not prevail in a game of mathematics. 
Screw you,

Take your bitch ass inflationary dollar and get the hell out the sub. You’re acting like a little snot nosed punk. We DO believe this is going to change the world, and no one here needs to convince you of it.

You can pay $15 right now and get your $10,000,00000000,999,9999,99999,999.00 transaction through in the next block. Fees are high but they the amount sent doesn’t necessarily effect the fee.

1. Found r/bitcoin
2. Within 30 minutes starts making ignorant incorrect statements about the topic 
3. Calls everyone toxic kids 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:38:30
No. It really doesn’t.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:26:26
Let’s go post that 2+2=5 in r/basicaddition, if they call me a dumbass I’ll just correct them grammatically and call them toxic kids. They obviously aren’t questioning their beliefs in math Jesus enough.

Thanks for the info ����

You’re a surprisingly fair fella.

Probably one of the lighter posts I would have removed, but this sub is about Bitcoin and posts need to start steering towards more relevant information.

New* Apple employees are too easy to spot. 
If you’re looking for safety, I think AAPL is more in your favor. Though, being younger, the general consensus is that you can make riskier financial moves (Bitcoin). I would let my short term capital gains (your most recent RSU’s and ESPP holdings) sit for at least one year to minimize the amount of taxes paid when cashing out. Only go all in if you believe the difference in taxes will be less than what you will make over that time in Bitcoin growing.
Edit: You’re fresh out of CORE.

We shouldn’t really be assuming anyone’s wealth. He’s a class act, living off bitcoin for years now and preaching it hard. He’s my  in this space, deserves to reap the rewards of crypto more than most...

Alright bud. Might be time to get your eyes checked and then after you can read on some scaling methods that include 1mb blocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:14:28
Flat lined? You do realize this is a logarithmic scale right?

Probably a good thing that you couldn’t get in? You got rid of your phone number, and 2FA, at the same time? And now you’re contacting them saying hey it’s me, why won’t you let me in? We’re in a new world people. You need to think ahead before you change phone numbers and get rid of important security information. 
I hope you get your funds back in a secure manner, but no one learns anything if we put it on Coinbase support to let you back in with a master key. They’d probably not be backlogged if it weren’t for those who can’t take care of their own information. We’d also probably have less of a need for backdoors if this type of thing was taken more seriously. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:32:46
What type of info did you post?
