I do agree with you but I still think it would be awesome to see something like [this]( in the super bowl.  If not this year maybe next.  It would generate a ton of talk 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:13:58
I think it's a great idea.  If there was a kickstarter I think they would reach the goal!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:15:43
It would be awesome if people donated to make an ad.  There a lot of people who want bitcoin to succeed so I think it is doable!  
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:20:54
Sure just create some sort of smart contract where the commercial automatically gets sent in once the goal is reached 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:46:40
you should probably just hodl tho ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:57:22
clever ad IMO  
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:08:22
So lets say you have a bunch of crypto and don't report it.  To what lengths can the government go to determine if you are telling the truth? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:17:44
we don't know he's Japanese...

bitcoin spreads peace not war
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:06:51
Ya I think this has potential to be really good for crypto... I also think this has potential for Venezuela to lead by a bad example (again).  Im nervous 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:02:12
okay so I was under the impression that Venezuela made bitcoin illegal... now there staring their own coin?  Surely they can't criminalize bitcoin now right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:44:18
Yes just mining.  Thank you for clarifying 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:20:05
Dude use an exchange... I pay .20% fees   
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:45:24
I have no experience with that exchange but you can sell on [local bitcoins](
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:37:46
Your completely right. However, given the history and the fact that the industry is growing (with regards to developers) I think the odds of price recovery looks good imo
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:15:40
they would actually save money with fees... visa takes 2% of every transaction while bitcoin takes 0% 
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:53:26
This says that coinbase's fees are unbeatable? And transactions are free? Doesn't seem right...
@_date: 2018-08-13 01:18:40
This sub is the reason many people care about the etf because that's what all the posts are about lately...
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:18:16
So I'm not very knowledgeable in this... but can someone explain to me the purpose of creating a burner address?
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:58:45
Exactly. Technically they're gambling that it will stay between $1 and 50k which is pretty safe.  And at today's btc price they would only need to buy a fraction of the amount placed on the 50k bet to hedge themselves... so def pretty dumb to make that bet I wonder how many people have 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:36:00
Yes this!
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:15:37
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:25:25
The thing is that it is necessary to do, but this sub is probably the worst place to post about it because people here know better and it shrinks the amount of posts about bitcoin.  Post that shit on facebook or twitter or wherever noobs may be   
@_date: 2018-05-07 03:45:40
I actually think he had some good points until he started talking about bitcoin... He completely disregarded the fact that it was created as a response to the flawed system we use today.  If anything harvested baby brains is closer to the current system 
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:50:35
I mean that you can't bet that bitcoin won't hit 50k in 2018. Not disagreeing with you it's just a different type of spread than usual 
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:18:41
His disregard for all the things that make bitcoin valuable is just ridiculous... and the lack of a follow up pointing it out is upsetting    
@_date: 2018-05-07 04:08:56
I think that because he has so much invested in the USD bitcoin becomes a huge threat to him and this is an effort to slow that down. To be fair if you asked someone heavily invested into crypto what their thoughts of the USD is they would give a similar answer.   
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:17:44
or coinsquare

the prob dont offer the opposite bet tho 
@_date: 2018-10-12 23:53:13
he didn't mention the voting power miners have... 
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:27:49
If bitcoin's price was 1 million that would be about $7... Im not completely sure how how the fee  structure would change with price change tho
@_date: 2018-06-21 23:30:43
Not trying to create any fud.. but I went to make a small transaction and noticed the fee was over $3.00 and thought it seemed high. This chart confirms that network fees have increased and I am wondering why? 
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:29:08
You can't send bitcoin from a paper wallet directly bc it doesn't have internet connection.
Blockchain.info will allow you to send by you entering you're private key. I'm pretty positive that it is safe to use. There are def alternatives but I haven't explored them (Hopefully someone can share more on this). I've never heard of blockchain.com and would prob lean towards .info
From the blockchain.info wallet you can send to an exchange that allows you to sell but depending what country you live in and the bank you have this varies. Coinbase is USA based so I assume you need a US bank account 
Alternatively, you can literally just sell the paper wallet to someone for cash. This reduces fees and is kinda the safest way to do it too
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:57:17
I guess that's good marketing... I mean it caught my eye and they can't be sued for using that name/logo right?
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:41:03
Nah let's say he met a buyer in a coffee shop and then the buyer sends the btc to his wallet. That would eliminate that threat
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:12:36
Is that the Soup Nazi!?
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:33:13
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:58:40
Of course it's an asset... 
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:48:11
Thats easy...Buy btc, if price falls below 9k then buy more btc
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:43:38
Yes that's exactly what I'm referring to. Thanks for the suggestion. However I know I've seen it on Reddit before and didn't think it would be so hard to find...
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:40:51
Haha ok thanks. However, I find that this particular chart isn't the best one to use because in the recent years it just looks kinda flat line while I believe inflation is at a higher level. I'm looking for a chart that reflects this better but struggling to find one...
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:58:35
Appreciate it! I'll try that next time
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:08:36
Classic dump and pump
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:47:06
Well said 
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:33:54
I don't know what this is supposed to accomplish 
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:07:51
Yes thank you!
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:19:01
agreed, some of the "reasons why people aren't buying" are based on  false ideas and just lack of awareness 
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:57:31


This seems huge! 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:56:42
I wouldn't say HUGE but it helps bring awareness to a community that prob knows very little about crypto  
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:21:35
Ya i can't believe how little was discussed about the non-monetary value bitcoin has.  It's the most secure network ever created obviously there is lot's of non-monetary value tied to that.  They didn't even discuss 2nd layer solutions like the omni protocol and projects like Factom which utilize the bitcoin blockchain 
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:48:09
Also the brave browser
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:00:19
Is there a website that maps out bitcoin ATM's and lists their fees? There should be 
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:49:10
Ya Schiff is the gold guy and he is old. He's come too far and is too old to change his ways now.  If he became a bitcoin supporter he wouldn't be invited to events like this or be as popular as he is.  
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:20:37
I'm sure that private key is in her will 
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:57:55
In my opinion I think that the $9,000 mark releases a lot of emotion from people.  Maybe i've just seen to many vegeta memes but I feel like when ever its over 9k there is a lot of celebrating and when it goes under 9k a lot of people panic. So I think that is why there is so much fluctuation around this number
@_date: 2018-04-21 17:26:10
because every transaction shows up on the ledger ;) 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:30:40
coinomi 
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:15:04
according to [google]( that note is worth 40 cents us!
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:46:53
50 - 1.99 - 1.71 = $46.30 
Im not sure how you got $37.5? This doesn't seem right

Based on the principle that uncertainty causes prices to go down, I think prices will go up following Aug 1st once things become clear 
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:28:37
Have you followed up at all? This absurd if they banned you for accepting crypto or selling a bitcoin patch but is it possible that they're actually cool with it and this was done by a faulty bot? 
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:29:45
What kind of crypto currency are you referring to? Like what would be the point of fb creating a new coin? Maybe they could do something like BAT but BAT already exists...
