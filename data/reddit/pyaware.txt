I'm really enthousiastic about experimenting with the blockchain technology, I view the blockchain + miners as a "notary as a service". Right now we use this to move money and certify the transfer is valid. I think we could use this notary to certify other things such as document existence, casino games  (satoshidice &amp; co are doing that with standard transactions).
Once people realize that and start using this, and if we start having too many transactions then maybe we can evolve Bitcoin to have a special entry in each block for a metadata merkle root or something alike.

A solution is to use 2 signature wallet as an intermediary between cold paper wallet and standard 1sig wallet. For a 2sig wallet to work you have to have one private key on your computer and the other one on a 2nd device (ie smartphone). You share the public keys between the devices so that with deterministic wallet (BIP32) you can generate addresses on both devices but you can't send a transaction without both.
Electrum already has code that seems to work for 2of2 wallets. I'm working on and off on a Windows Phone prototype app since a few weeks but I'm new with c++/c# so things move slowly.

I guess I could use filter(), is that what pep8 says?

I based my claim on what is said here: &lt; in the "Provably Prune-able Outputs" section.
