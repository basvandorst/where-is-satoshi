I'm confused by the wording of this whole thread. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 00:44:20
I might be able to get the owner of Red Chilli (Jones and o Farrel) to accept it. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 06:21:49
It's youuuuuuuuuuuuu

Love my CU. Always hear horror stories especially boa and chase 
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:48:06
It sucks that their lives suck right now but this place is not a suicide hotline. That person should have gone to someone who can actually help. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:41:20
You could make a series of tubes with that plastic

I saw the a coin was 1136 on the ticker. Nearly had a heart attack. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:49:57
But a bitch ain't one
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:39:44
They still make MAD right?

Welcome to the circus of values!

Thank god a janitor is in the house 
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:01:47
Yep...

Maybe 5% but most of my money goes to rent.

Oh, I've seen him in the past and he seems like a great guy.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:27:31
Yea but it's like that on any forum or subreddit for the most part. People think they have a breaking story and don't bother to see if anyone has posted the same stuff. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:58:22
Bitcoin and doge? Very nice. I like the idea of this. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 05:53:04
First they pee in my coke and now this.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:25:41
Get rid of them before they get rid of you. Find an awesome credit union in your area. Enjoy a bank free life. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:42:28
Good for the hat industry. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:39:30
The first thing you should do with any investment is to do your OWN due diligence. After that, explain to yourself why you think it is a good idea to invest in bitcoin. If you can't come up with anything, don't put your money into it.
Secondly, being condescending to the people that don't have the perfect response you're looking for is ridiculous. Nobody knows what is going to happen in the future. NOBODY. You can get a grasp on what might come by doing your own DD.

If his seizures are really bad (like daily), you should look into CBD

I would say it is more dessert than coffee.
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:33:27
In depth analysis.
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:10:43
For more reasons that bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:34:56
I am. If it isn't gox it's about Satoshi. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:46:43
This. Credit Unions all the way. This is a good thing OP.
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:49:56
Cafes are usually alright but too many cash only restaurants, especially in the mission and Richmond. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 04:50:21
Maybe she was just saying it to be friendly.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:01:08
So much beer.. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:38:37
Maybe they did but it was only $1 worth heh

It's a phishing link
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:57:06
Oh yea...I read it too fast on my phone and seemed to miss that.
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:49:58
That is all that was necessary for the OP. Again, you shouldn't let others dictate where your money goes. Figure out why YOU think it will go up or down and worthy of your money. You have the answer. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:15:30
Are you with a bank that has closed accounts for buying from coinbase? Chase is an example. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:10:21
Credit union. Would never sign up with a bank. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:41:02
Never has the US dollar been used for illegal activity. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:45:02
Through silk road. I was going to buy some but I didn't think I would ever use it. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:28:05
Where we're going, we don't need...roads.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:19:37
Probably best not to obsess. If something bad happens you will be devastated. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:30:15
My landlord is Chinese..  But super old 
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:37:40
Lord knows it does with me
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:48:03
I can see her wallet
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:53:51
I was staring at coinbase at 407 for a bit... Totally should have just bought in but I hesitated because I thought the price would go a bit lower due to gox shitstorm. Oh well.. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:58:25
I feel like it would be China part 2. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:16:17
Fees fees fees! 
@_date: 2014-06-10 02:50:44
I saw a guy on Bush and grant or Kearny handing those out. Wouldn't mind trying bamboo Asia for 5 off. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:35:50
Hmm everything is upside down 
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:54:00
I'm not sure if the world needs a coin for every industry. You could just use doge or even bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-06 05:11:23
My friend works as a customer support guy. He likes his job. Pretty jealous but I wouldn't consider myself as anywhere near smartest based on the test. Too bad, like the company and live in SF.
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:55:13
Nice. I'm an easy bus ride away from Japantown. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:28:29
It's a way to draw you in to click the link... 
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:47:10
Article says it will be shipped at the same speed or faster so probably. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:26:05
You can see the price on the homepage 
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:47:10
I need to watch this when I get home 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:08:46
Just called up my boss and told her to suck it. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:17:08
Yes but this is not the place to post shit like that. Nobody has any obligation to be nice. I'm not saying I agree with what they told these people but it is what it is. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:03:10
USPS definitely could use some revenue from this and being able to ship beer. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:24:10
You're lucky if they accept credit card in San Francisco.
