Ok, that makes sense. But I don't see anything about this in the wallet. How do I know what my digital signature is?

I thought the 51% just had to do with someone having the ability to control confirmations of new blocks (new coin issuance)?

Ok, I had read that before, but it didn't explain why. I keep finding so many of these documents that are either "wham, bamm, powerpoint bullets" or "CS degree required, beyond here lie dragons". And trying to get a middle ground understanding seems to be challenging.

Ok, so where do I generate this private key? I don't recall seeing anything about this in the bitcoin client/wallet.

Understood. Thanks! ... I was also asking because I know that sometimes, just because everyone else does something, doesn't always mean it's the best way to do it.

I'd check again Wendsday morning and then in the afternoon. If you get three bumps in a row, it's almost certainly a Big Spike Pattern. Sell everything to Nook so you don't end with a loss.

One more question. So if I posted a receiving address on a website where I'm looking to get donations to help cover maintenance costs. In theory that would be an ok thing to do from what I'm reading in this discussion.

So, in theory, if someone controlled 51%, they could fake the confirmations and steal everyone's coins?

Ok, cool. Thank-you for the info. This whole aspect had been puzzling me for awhile now.

Yeah, but just like U.S. propaganda news sites like Brietbart, there's often some basic nuggets of info that give insight into what the group behind it is thinking and promoting.
