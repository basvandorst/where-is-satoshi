No one has mentioned that Robinhood charges hidden fees via a spread.  You're paying a fee in the spread of the price (It's built in). It's in the agreement you accept before you can start trading crypto. If you look at the difference between the price you would get buying vs. selling you can calculate what fee you are being charged. It can be as high as 5%

It would be helpful if you provided what country you are in as Cash to Crypto exchanges can vary based on country. That being said if you are in the USA, the easiest way for an individual to buy with the lowest fees would be to open a Coinbase Pro account and made an ACH deposit directly into your account. From there you can create an order to buy Bitcoin for a transaction fee of 0.05%. [Here]( is more info on how to deposit and buy Bitcoin if you're interested.

Help needed: HitBTC Account Restricted 
Don’t know where to ask this because my karma is too low to make a post
I thought I could use HitBTC without verification on an old account I had if I withdrew under 1 BTC. I requested a withdrawal and now they are making me go through KYC. I’m from the US and according to the TOS it’s not allowed to be from the USA but they do let you withdraw according to the [TOS]( Should I go ahead and submit my USA info? I really don’t want HitBTC to keep my money so any information would be appreciated.

Interesting Study! Feel free to DM me

What percentage of investors hold their own keys?
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:25:12
Sounds like an interesting study be sure to post results

I would have included Bitcoin but, it's too dominate to accurately show the stream of failed competitors
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:08:21
Should have bought Bitcoin
