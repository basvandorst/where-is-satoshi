How are you going to overthrow the banking system when your average transfer fee is 30.00? On top of that, it takes hours to confirm? Is this really practical? I would rather use PayPal, western Union, and any other service before I used Bitcoin.

I was an early investor in Bitcoin. I know the community inside out. With that said, Bitcoin was designed to buy a cup of coffee. In fact it was designed to be used throughout the world for everything. Bitcoin only became a store of value when blockstream crippled the coin by not increasing the blocksize. Yes I know, your going to call me a Bitcoin Cash shill, but couldn’t they have just raised the block size until the shit “lightning network” is complete? You sound like someone that bought in to get rich real fast. Bitcoin was NEVER meant to be a store of value. It was designed to be a world wide currency!

Lighting network will not solve anything. Nobody is going to open up payment channels for hundreds of dollars. It will end up high fees and centralized. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:14:04
I did do something about it. I converted all my Bitcoins to Bitcoin Cash. I am done with the Bitcoin hopes and dreams. At least Bitcoin Cash have got transaction fees low and faster confirmation times down.

I invested in Bitcoin in its early stages because I understood what it could bring to society. With the mass adoption of Bitcoin and the transaction and fees through the roof, this is now not possible. Bitcoin Cash makes that possible and that is why I converted most of my Bitcoins to Bitcoin Cash. I only held a few Bitcoin because I know how the masses work, but eventually Bitcoin Cash will be the next Bitcoin. Roger Ver deserved to be on there because he is promoting a coin that can help everyone, not just the rich.

Here is the problem though. Who is going to run the 2nd-layer, off chain? It is definitely going to be centralized. Is there going to be a patent for this off chain layer? If this is the case, Bitcoin is no better than visa, mastercard, or paypal.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:06:12
Nobody is nervous about anything, it is the truth. Bitcoin is a worthless crypto currency that has no value to society except it was the first crypto. I would rather use fiat dollars than Bitcoin. The only nervous people are the ones that have dumped their life savings in a coin that is worthless.

Do you even know why we forked? Because we all waited in limbo for THREE years for something to happen. We got promise, after promise, after promise. Our last resort was to fork!

I have seen people buy BCH thinking it’s BCH and then sending it to a BTC wallet, but I have not seen people buying BCH thinking it’s BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:14:52
I’ll be honest. I like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I’m heavily invested into both. I think both have pros and both have cons. Not everyone that likes Bitcoin Cash likes Roger Ver. Honestly, I’ve never once listened to a full video of him. The censorship runs deep in both BCH and BTC forums. The name calling and childish games exists on both sides. In my opinion, the BCH crowd wants Bitcoin to fail so they can gain all that market cap. On the other side, I think BTC is a bit uneasy that this “could possibly happen”, and they discredit the crap out of it. There are intelligent groups on both sides of the aisle, may the best coin win .
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:44:58
You are spot on!
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:11:01
Ver just does everything. He must be God! 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:08:59
That’s the line now, confusion. Nobody I know is confused. I mean we have Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Candy, etc. Please explain the confusion because I don’t understand.
@_date: 2018-05-02 20:12:52
You are another person that is lost with reality and drank the medicine of R/bitcoin. I have been going in Bitcoin since 2011. I am heavily invested in both BTC and BCH. Like I have repeated 1000 times. You are only referring to Bitcoin.com as “tricking the public”. Let me clear something up. I have brought hundreds of people into the crypto community. Not one of them was tricked when they finally bought some crypto. You know why? Because even after I gave them my knowledge of Bitcoin and crypto, they did weeks and sometimes months of research for they bought any. Do you think Bitcoin Cash 25 billion market cap is people being tricked? If so, you’re a dumbass. I favor BCH over BTC just because it works at the time being. This could have all been avoided if some greedy people would have just increased the blocksize years ago and then worked on 2nd layer solutions in parallel. Quit drinking the cool aid!

They just came out with an SD card that holds 1 tb. I don’t know about the terabyte per block, but by the time it goes global a tb will be what a gb is today. Plus the Bitcoin Cash community is not totally against 2nd layer solutions, but something had to be done. Segwit and lighting is def not the answer. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:33:16
I would love to agree with you, but your observation is not correct. R/bitcoin pretended to have low fees, fast transactions, and a honest development team for a long time. None of these accusations were true and R/bitcoin promoted them for a long time. Do you know the history of why Bitcoin Cash even forked? It was not to create a "Shit coin" to pretend to be something else. I was an early investor into Bitcoin back in 2011 and I definitely did not want a split, but at what point do you keep falling down the rabbit hole? It was 3 solid years of bickering about block size and how to make transactions cheap and transactions faster. Especially when we had the interest of people flooding into Bitcoin. Do you know how many people called me a liar because they bought into Bitcoin and it was more than 10 dollars to send money to someone? Not only that, but it took 6 hours to confirm? At what point do you sit back and trust "some developers" to have your best interest? Not only that, but we finally agreed on the Segwit 2x and the Core team backed out at the last minute. That is why Bitcoin Cash forked. Most people that like Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash, like myself, want to see what works out the best. In my opinion, I do not think keeping increasing the block size is the best solution, but it works for the time being, while new technology is being developed. Why do you think Bitcoin Cash has been successful since its creation? It is not because everyone was scammed into thinking it was Bitcoin. They bought in because it is practical and it works. They can run a business using that currency without high fees and slow transaction times.

Are you serious? I am actively in both communities, r/bitcoin and r/btc. Theses groups are both toxic. You are playing the card that this form is without blemish. Mostly ever other post is roger Ver this and roger Ver that. R/bitcoin talks the same amount of shit as r/btc, maybe more. Both communities needs to grow up.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:57:58
Please explain scientifically why it’s an absurd idea? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:17:28
Ok. Let’s go with user adoption. Bitcoin cash is being adopted a whole lot more than Bitcoin. Is that a fake also? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:02:15
There was really no consensus. Bitcoin messed around for years when we needed real change. They made everyone believe that Segway and LN was the way to go. They manipulated us just like the MSM does. Why couldn’t we just increase the block size a little while the 2nd layer solutions were being developed. Could you imagine the price of Bitcoin now if it worked while volume was up? The answer is they never wanted low fees bc they would not line their pockets full of money. Quit acting like their is consensus. They only consensus is by force and you play around like you have some say in it. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:36:35
Bitcoin Cash exists because three years of back and forth bs. Something had to be done. Do you remember when everyone agreed to raise the blocksize to 2mb and blockstream backed out at the last second? They backed out bc high fees were “good”. I mean blockstream has you all believing that bitcoin is just a store of value. The funny thing is, you all bought it. If you cannot have extremely low fees and fast transaction times, then bitcoin is useless. I’ll just pick use PayPal or another POS payment system. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 00:19:44
I’ve never seen anyone “get scammed”. I think you are just scared, in my opinion. You sound like a great politician 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:25:02
I agree babydoll. I say the same things in that sub. It’s ridiculous that this has come down to this. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:54:22
This kind of sentiment and attitude will ruin Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:45:50
I agree! Both sides needs to focus on their coin and the best one will win. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:18:50
I applaud your maturity. I heavily invested into Bitcoin in 2011 and I now have 50/50 of both coins. All this subreddit contains is how bad Bitcoin Cash. It has no substance to it. If I were an outsider and say this subreddit, my first impression would be that they are highly scared of BCH. These Reddit’s should be about adoption and the future, instead its roger (scam) vet this and Bcash scam that. It’s like you said, childish! I have brought a lot of people into crypto and not one person was confused and bought the wrong coin. They did weeks and months of research. Was this your experience? People on this subreddit want to argue that they are just trying to protect people buying the wrong coin. I call BS, they are just scared. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:59:42
Fair enough, there is a few deceptive links that call it the real Bitcoin. Ok, who cares? If they are not a threat, then what’s the big deal? There is over 15 coins with the Bitcoin name and some of them have deceptive tactics, but I don’t see this community always attacking them. I feel like some people on this thread are scared of Bcash. All I’m saying is it looks bad when newbies come on this forum and all we are concerned about is trashing Bcash. If I didn’t know any better, my first impression would be that the people in this community are jealous. Do you get what I’m trying to say? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:23:49
Look, I have spoke time and time again on this forum about this issue. Quit worrying about BCH. There is no one and I repeat NO ONE that I know that has bought the wrong coin. I have brought many people into the crypto world and it was weeks and months after I introduced them to it that they finally bought. Not one of them bought the wrong coin or was mislead. Yes, they had questions, but I gave them my honest answer and then the understood. No idiot is going to download the app and just buy. I have been in Bitcoin since 2011 and honestly the Cash community reminds me of the optimism that Bitcoin had way back when. This community is filled with toxic BS that needs to stop. For the Record I have 50/50 holdings in BTC and BCH. If you understood the issues from the beginning, you have to respect Cash from forking because obviously the LN and Segwit are not doing their job. When a spike in transaction hit the other day the average transaction fee on the BTC network was 2.30. That is ridiculous!  
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:21:54
You’re a damn idiot. The reason Bitcoin is where it’s at today is because of people wanting to get away from governments can trolling money. Now you want government to protect it? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:09:58
I am a fan of the LN and second layer solutions and I do not think the bigger blocks are the answer. With that said, why do we keep wasting our energy with Bcash. The better coin will prevail and they have just as much right to the Bitcoin name as we do. I am not worried about Bcash because I think Bitcoin with second layer solutions will prevail and I’m tired of wasting my energy worries about something else. Let it be and let’s just focus our energy on the bright future! 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:35:33
If you would spend half as much time on promoting Bitcoin instead of worrying about Bcash, Bitcoin might prosper more. All people care about on this form is the price and to trash other coins. I’m sick of it! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:09:14
That’s BS. Anyone buying into crypto does their research first. I have gotten many people into crypto and they researched for weeks, sometimes months before they bought anything. I’m not going to say it never happens, but to waste your energy on Bcash because you don’t want newcomers to get deceived is total rubbish.
