A secure, censorship-resistant store of value *is* real world use — it is THE real-world use for bitcoin at the moment — and each bubble in the hype cycle spreads the adoption of BTC as a store of value to a user base that's an order of magnitude larger than the previous one.

Yes, of course. It's really asking for it not to pay taxes when the ledger is public and Coinbase gives the IRS all of their information.
Assuming you're an American, if you held the bitcoin for more than a year than the lower, long-term cap gains tax is what applies. I think the max you'd pay is 20% but it's more likely going to be 15%.

Interesting that you have to add the "consumer" qualifier there. If anyone asks whether Linux has been successful, I wouldn't point them to the consumer market (although if we measure "success" by some measure other than market share Linux has actually done really well).

Where did you get that Linux "was supposed" to become the world's leading consumer desktop OS? It had much more humble origins than that.
What it *has* become is a world-class (if not first in market share) free OS that is easy for anyone to use — yes, including and perhaps especially including the poorest people in the world.
As for the rest of us "typical consumers," all you have to ask is, do you use the internet? If yes, then you are using Linux. It's the most successful server/backend OS by far.

This isn't a serious objection, IMO. Bitcoin paychecks will come from firms that value your labor/products more than they value that particular amount of bitcoin. Just like with any other currency.
You are way, way underestimating the pressure people feel to spend when they see their BTC stash gain in value. Look at the earliest holders of bitcoin, who traded hundreds and even thousands of BTC for pizzas, online gambling games, a few grams of marijuana, and so on.
Present-day hodlers have learned some from that history, but they too have their own personal goals where they would spend BTC if it hit a price of X dollar amount per coin. Very few actually withstand those pressures and hodl through big gains.
The "deflation is the worst thing for an economy" myth needs to die a swift, terrible death. I am hoping bitcoin becomes the executioner.

Fractional-reserve banking is *not* the only way to introduce loans into an economy.


\- Ludwig von Mises, [The Theory of Money and Credit](
There is plenty of bitcoin to fuel a modern, fast-paced, innovative and technological economy. If we need "more" bitcoin, more decimal places can be added. There is no need for altcoins, private coins "trust-anchored to bitcoin," IOUs, etc. — in short, there is no need for an artificially expanded supply of money.
Unfortunately, we've lived in a world so detached from this economic reality that it's going to take time for that truth to sink into people's skulls.

You can also do what you're asking on LN, today, of course. But I don't think it's quite as powerful as the mega transactions that are unstoppable by any bank or state and frictionless for the users.

There is nothing about "digital cash" as a concept that means "can't be an investment vehicle." These things are not mutually exclusive. In fact, sound money *is* a good investment vehicle because it is a liquid asset — the most liquid asset, in fact — that increases in value over time.
Title reads like bait for r/bitcoin, hoping someone will respond with a digital gold comment that can then be repeated and mocked on that other sub. Who are you actually talking to, who is this person who says bitcoin isn't a technology that will disrupt a corrupt banking structure?

The technical challenge of modifying code is not why it hasn't been increased. Increased block weight = decreased security, meaning more mutable transactions, which would attack what is by far bitcoin's most important attribute.

It means greater security. 
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:14:50
No. You should have kept reading after my first sentence, but I'll repeat it: the Bitcoin Core team *does not refer to BTC* as "bitcoin core." Only bcashers do. 
Take a look at the comments you were responding to: OP is asking about who commonly refers to BTC as "bitcoin core."
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:47:10
The paragraph you cite has nothing to do with the assertions you make after, except that the word "scale" is used. Szabo's talking about a barter economy, where chicken eggs have different prices in wheat, butter, milk, etc. And wheat has different prices in eggs, butter, milk, etc. And so on. *That's* what doesn't scale, and that's what money, as a technology, solves. Money is the sole barter good in an advanced economy.
To your point: bitcoin scales just fine, and the alt-coins that "solved" this problem do so by compromising decentralization and security. You might think they are superior blockchains, but the market disagrees with that assessment.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:15:22
No matter how you slice it, $5 is a cheap price to pay to transact on the world's most secure ledger. We are living at a historically peculiar time when the block reward subsidizes transactions far more than what will be  normal for most human beings who use bitcoin.

I mean, you're free to prefer and use a less secure blockchain that is prone to attacks — I guess some people would be comfortable knowing they at least "can see them coming from a mile away," but I can't say I am.
I just don't think we should be surprised that the majority of the world will prefer the best, most secure blockchain, particularly when sending $500M somewhere.

@_date: 2019-06-27 17:47:37
That might be one reason to DCA, but another reason is if you want to have a significant investment over the long-term but *don't have the cash to do it now*. That's what OP is most likely celebrating.

Which is why I said "even more".
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:04:14
It would send but it'd be far less secure. And when you're sending $500M security is pretty important.
Plus, at bitsteiner points out the liquidity isn't there to get $500M *into* an alt-coin in the first place. The only realistic option right now is bitcoin.

Thanks for the tip, but that essay well precedes bitcoin and wasn't written with an agenda. You should try reading it.
And anyway most of my understanding of money comes from reading history and economics.

@_date: 2019-06-27 17:14:19
These aren't good objections.
You have to really cherry-pick dates to create a scenario in which DCAing into bitcoin wasn't profitable. Specifically, putting in money only in late Nov / early Dec 2017 and then doing nothing for the next year and half. Which isn't really DCAing. And anyway, all other scenarios equal nice profits.
Why didn't OP just dump $6,000 on day one and made more? (For that matter, why didn't he just buy in 2011, or mine in 2009?) Probably because, like most people, he didn't have $6,000 lying around. But he was able to put in $200 a month, so that's what he did. Good for him; many can learn from this example.

Even by his own optimistic calculations, one year from now he will be sitting on the same $20k plus a mining farm that will need to be upgraded someday. Let's say he earns $1,200/month for two years after that. OK, we're at the end of year 3 and now he's got $48,800 plus some rapidly decaying hardware.
Not bad, eh?
But consider: Three years ago today, bitcoin's price was $430. A $20k investment in BTC in April 2016, stored in a cold wallet for three years ("for no work") would today be worth about $250,000 — and that's us bumbling along the bottom of the most recent bear market.
Even if his optimistic, best-case-scenario works out, the odds are strong that he'd still be a loser compared to just buying BTC directly. Leave the mining to professionals and tell him to buy what will be close to 4 btc, which will probably grow well into six figures during the next bull market.

There's nothing wrong with spending BTC — apart from placing yourself on the wrong side of Gresham's law, which I'm not personally inclined to do — but neither does it make one superior to hodlers. The value of a money is determined by its reservation demand, and all money serves first as a medium of savings / store of value before it becomes the generally accepted medium of exchange. After that it becomes a unit of account, the ultimate sign that something is truly a dominant currency. Only at this last stage will bitcoin flow freely back and forth in commerce. We don't have to force it to get there: when it makes sense, people will naturally do it.
By hodling, believing in bitcoin, and rejecting current market prices bidding on our holdings, those of use who use it as a medium of savings are doing as much or more to give the world a reason to use it. Bitcoin's value comes from its properties, security, immutability, and censorship resistance, not from the number of people trading it back and forth for a coffee.

@_date: 2018-04-12 13:49:45
Whatever you think of taxes, the government says you owe them. And if you decide they aren't important and don't pay them, you are taking a risk. That risk exists no matter what your view of taxes are, meaning it's false to say that this "depends entirely on one's view of taxes."
Similarly, one can try to say that a government's taxes are not bitcoin's problem. In the abstract, maybe that works. But if you're trying to make an argument that bitcoin needs to be used in the real world — which is the point of the meme — it's crucial to take into account *what it means* to use bitcoin in the real world. In the real world, in many countries, the government says you owe taxes when you spend them as currency. You can pay them, which makes spending bitcoin impractical, or you can ignore them, which incurs risk. Either way, it's not as simple as the "spend it" advocates would have you believe.
