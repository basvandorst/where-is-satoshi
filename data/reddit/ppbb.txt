It could be a base64 encoding of a private key. Mayve try to decode it and check what you get as result..
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:12:16
Didn't think about that. That's a good point, thank you. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:31:08
There is another point. The error in the PK given by the OP was a 'g', which in reality had to be a 'f'.
Some people write a low-case 'f' very similar to a low-case 'g' and that *could* be an indication that the 'f' was interpreted as 'g' because the private key was been hand-written by another person.
If you write down a private key, you would automatically write accurately, and I find it rather strange that - at a later time - you would interpret your own 'f' as a 'g'.

I don't think I can do much more.. My intent is the same : if someone could convince me reasonably that the correct PK was its own (instead of OP one) , then I would refund him, also if that would mean a loss for me.  Maybe I was a little lightheaded to help OP without some kind of proof. On the other side this is all just a suspect.. Maybe OP was saying the truth and he just disappeared from reddit for some other reason.

I didn't notice someone posting the correct key. So I was thinking it was still only known to me. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:28:02
No. Not that I expected too much.
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:02:01
Thank you very much! 
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:33:02
The transaction is out. Yes, you don't need to send a reward. Glad I could help you!
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:59:29
I didn't notice this was known. In this case, I will try to be not that much retarded.
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:12:21
Hi. I found the private key. I have transferred all the founds to my address just because I wanted to be fast. I will send them back fully to your given address soon. You don't need to send me a reward.
Have a nice day! :)
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:17:55
That's true. I didn't realize the PK was known and, if needed, I could have requested for a signed message. Now there is not very much I can do. Let's hope it was all legit. I am not much worried for the possiblity to have been scammed myself. I am more worried for the possiblity, someone is looking/needing for his own funds and cannot find them anymore. 0.5BTC can be not so much for someone; but very much for others..
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:27:03
I don't understand what you mean with " not doing what promised" . I did what promised: OP received all his funds short after I moved them from the original address. This is also the reason why - assuming that was a theft organised by OP -  refunding the actual owner would mean a loss for me (i would loose the 0.52)
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:41:58
At that point I would buy as hell.. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:42:28
Now that I have some time (daughter finally sleeping) I would like to add something to this.
First of all I am overwhelmed with all the tips and golds! Really thank you very much to all of you!
I have read one of the latest comments suspecting this could be a scam organized by the OP and myself to get tips.
Well, yes, it could be; but it is not. I cannot think any way to prove this, so I will not even try.
Nonetheless, the most important reason I write this update is someway related..
Actually the more I think about it, the more I have the suspect that it WAS actually a scam and I myself am the victim.
I really hope I am just thinking too much and just getting paranoic!
But let's imagine, for example, this scenario: it's Christmas time, you are a young 'nice' boy and you go with your parents to visit your grannies. You find somewhere a strange hand written note of your tech savy grandfather... wow.. this really looks like a private key of a bitcoin address! As you are a really 'nice' boy, you write down the key as quickly as possible, and you start dreaming about your unexpected fortune. When you go back home, you try using the private key but something went wrong.. the key is not valid... maybe you wrote it down too quickly? What can you do now? Well, there is that bitcoin Reddit channel.. there are some good people there... maybe someone of them can find out what is wrong with the key??
So, the reason why I am writing this - instead of going to bed as I should - is:
did I actually help a theft to occur??
I checked the new address the OP gave for sending "back" the funds.. (13uJGCedAfPBaxYncZq4tHhuGdxGxHiexN). All the funds have been already spent in several transactions.. maybe the owner wanted to spend them as soon as possible?
The OP seems also to be disappeared.. (or you are not?)
What do you think? Am I just getting too paranoic?
I am actually pretty worried... I am so worried, I am almost considering the eventuality, to send the moved sum (0,52...BTC) to the original address again (whose private key I luckily still didn't reveal).
If the OP was telling the truth, nobody can actually spend money from that address (although there is the risk related to the fact that part of the private key was posted).
Of course this is a big sum, but I would hate to have (unintentionally) stolen some other person, for which maybe - who knows - this is an even bigger one??
Maybe some one of you (and I mean the really nice guys among you) have some suggestion?
@_date: 2015-01-12 00:50:53
I am sorry if this is a violation of the rules.
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:20:57
Too bad, being the private key known, every one could generate a signature for that address..
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:15:34
This is the critical point of the whole thing. As you know the private key is not needed to be sent in your transaction. Only the signature is provided. The signature is just a bunch of bytes which proves beyond any doubt that you have the private key but without revealing the private key itself (another math magic). To build the signature your software (pc wallet, mobile app etc) must have stored and use the private key in some way. While doing this, a virus or malware of some kind could find some weakness and get access to the private key, which means your funds are gone. This is why hardware wallets are currently the best alternative to keep your funds safe. They store the private key inside their hardware and never need to reveal it outside. You can ask them via software to sign a transaction, and they do inside them and then deliver back only the signature. In this scenario, also if your PC or mobile is badly compromised, the malware can only see the signature, which alone is useless.

There is no need to be online to generate a key pair. At the very end it works like this. First of all a random number is generated. That is your private key. How can you know that no other people has already that private key? It's just a matter of probability. The random number has such a big range of possibilities that it literally makes no sense to fear a collision with another address in use (just like you live your life without fearing being hit from a meteorite, which by the way is more probable). Now you make a very easy operation on the private key and you get the public key. That's more or less your address. That is really all. You must trust the fact that it is impossible to calculate the private key having only knowledge of the public key. It's based on math, so it's a pretty solid fact. A brute force attack is in principle still possible, but for the reasons above for the next future meaningless.

If I understand correctly I think you need the site below. Enter the bip39 words list under 'bip39 mnemonic'. Leave all the other parameters at their default value. In the bottom you will see the generated addresses and private keys. NOTE: after having loaded the site, you can disconnect your network cable, for peace of mind. The site works also offline.

I would not care that much about being annoying as I would need it only rarely, that is when spending from the passphrase protected wallet. For normal usage I would use the standard passphrase-free wallet. Thank you for your hints. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:46:43
Actually I am more thinking about a scenario where I don't care too much about the secrecy of the seed and instead I care extremely about the secrecy of the passphrase. I can remember a (very long and not containing any dictionary word) passphrase, but I cannot remember a seed. For this reason I would tend to have many copies of the seed (also on Cloud,  for example) and just remember the passphrase. This is the reason of my worries. I didn't know about the nano s.  Thanks for the info.

I'm glad if it helped.

Too bad if you loose your wallet (to be more precise, your private key) you cannot prove you 'own" that address. The private key knowledge is the proof, nothing less, nothing more. The fact, you was sending transactions to that address from an exchange means not so much.. Maybe you was paying someone for something? Without private key you cannot prove you was actually sending transactions to an address controlled by yourself. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 07:32:01
Hardware wallets are not "containing" bitcoins. They only contain your privatey keys (which in turn are the only things needed to move the coins, which are actually 'stored' in the blockchain) . And those private keys are all generated with a known algorithm which only need a seed to work. If you loose your Trezor, you loose your private keys but as long as you have still your seed, you can use this seed to generate those keys again and again. And not necessarily on another Trezor. Every hardware or software implementing that algorithm can regenerate your private keys.
