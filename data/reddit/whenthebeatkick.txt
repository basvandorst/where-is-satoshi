honestly i dont know how the wallet stuff works. i have all my money on the exchange right now. i do plan on pulling some into cold storage soon but i havent done the research on how exactly to do that yet.
as far as I know the wallets arent like a conventional wallet. more like if you had a wallet that had a piece of paper inside of it that had the code to a safe written down in it. i may be wrong but thats how i thought it worked. the blockchain is basically a ledger that shows address r7793tefo8ewgf has $34487 BTC and you use your wallet(secret codes) to access that balance on the blockchain. Someone can chime in and correct me if i'm wrong, ha.

I moved mine to an exchange to trade for other  coins. I’m about to start putting some into cold storage wallets so it’s hard for me to get out until I really need it. I still need to look into the exact process for each coin

Look at the other comment I just hit send on and then immediately you responded with this. I’ll see what Gemini has to offer

Yep, there’s no time to wait

That sounds interesting and would save me a step, and force me into it

i wouldn't save the $20, I'd spend it. lol. I make bad financial decisions. Also i learned about gdax recently and i just deposited fiat there and i think that cuts out the fee's, besides whatever i will have to pay to transfer over to binance? Only issue is I can't lock in the price, so since i made that deposit BTC has gone way up and my fiat hasn't become available yet to buy BTC. If there's a quicker way to get fiat into an exchange I'd like to know about it.

I’ve been using coinbase, that’s what I’m trying to avoid. Gdax cuts out fees but you can’t lock in a price. Coinbase app takes fees but locks in a price. You might end up making more money just paying the fee and locking in price if it’s on the rise, as you’ve seen. 
It’s probably too much to ask for super low fee instant debit card buys where price is locked in and I have bitcoin in my wallet moments later. Card payments take time to post but an exchange could get savvy and “front” you the bitcoin while your card transaction is pending, so you could have quicker access to trading. If they did that, and offered a real low fee, they could prob make the money back because everyone would jump ship and move to that exchange for those benefits. (Maybe this exists already and I’m just an idiot). Hope that makes sense, just finished a 12 hour shift lol.
