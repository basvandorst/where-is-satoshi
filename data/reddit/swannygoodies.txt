I’m a single mom of two college girls.   I don’t have much save up for retirement but I have some.   I’ve sold all my stocks and refinance my house with cash out went pretty much all in 2017.   My average buy for btc was $13000.,, Than it hit all time high in December 2017.   I made money but never cash out any of the profits.   2018 it was the worst year ever....I felt like I’ve lost everything but I’m still HODL  until now... I’m praying that this will be my retirement money if it work out and have some extra to help pay off my daughters student loans.   GOOD LUCK TO US!

I watched this documentary videos a week ago and even paid my 21 and 19 years old daughters daughters $150 each if they would watch the video to the end.  But here is my catch they have to open an account with coinbase and that they have to use $150 I paid them to buy bitcoin with it and they can’t cash it out for at least five years if they choose to. They watched it and did what I asked.  Couple days later they both bought $500 more of bitcoin each... my job is done on introducing them to the best assets ever created.
