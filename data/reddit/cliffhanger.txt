this is some serious shit.

it’s just a joke for all the new hands.

I made a post for this - it didn’t really take off Lol. Win some, lose some.

Well thanks for trying I guess. I based my argument on the effects of having a fixed supply currency among nations that acts as a marker for individual countries. If this marker came to be accepted, it would be safe to say countries use it for payments to other countries since it's universally recognized. Of course forex trading wouldn't be completely eliminated, but that's essentially what we do on a lesser scale. I worded it in a way that kicked it up a few notches. 
I know it sounds very grandiose, but it's not out of the realm of possibility. I'm not sold on the idea, but I think it does have a little credibility.

My original post was a chain of thoughts, not a complete thoroughly vetted idea, I enjoy seeing the holes in it from those such as yourself. 
But I think you can see the ideas I was attempting to pursue here and the possibilities that can arise.

I just kept thinking poor lady as I read through. If Arizona understands it enough to accept it, *it might just be you who doesn’t.*

I get what you are saying, and I understand where that notion is derived from but I don't see the impossibility of banks creating the node infrastructure needed to support a block chain.

True but I'm sure life changing gains have been made for some nonetheless for those that have cashed out a bit

Thank you for the in depth explanations
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:39:50
I'm not trying to be dramatic or dystopian. It was an honest idea that I couldn't answer myself. I was hoping others such as yourself would quell that with valid explanations. That's all

Fire away
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:55:40
thanks for the response. I agree with your sentiment. The situation I described above would require collusion amongst banks and although that has occurred in the past, would be quite an undertaking to be carried out.

[HODL]( - I made this site and glossary for peeps like you. Let me know of any other words you would like to see added!
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:56:38
Not to toot my own horn, but I’m in the second round of development of a site that’s overall goal is to be an educational *entry level* one stop shop. I have to manually research to properly explain coins but hey, I’m slowly but surely getting to all of em. It’s free too. 
No frills. Probably boring to most, but I’m trying. Give us a look newcomers, let us know what you’d want to see (besides more coins added of course).
Thanks.

You're talking about mutual funds bud. Mutual funds give fractional shares.

Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate your insight

I know I know...why you gotta burst my bubble man...

Yes...it could be a decentralized currency with a common denominator between hundreds of nations. Which we do not have in the world right now. All we have currently is standard bearers, which are the dollar and euro. 
I think what a lot of people are failing to realize is I transposed what is currently happening to bitcoin and added governments backing. It was an idea that I hoped people could partially agree/disagree with and provide feedback of their own or expand on it. I understand this goes against the libertarian philosophy of the sub &amp; bitcoin. But I figured it was worth a shot to throw this extrapolation into the arena.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:09:47
It's not a commodity. It's a currency. Commodities have uses, currencies are recognized values exchanged to obtain items of use. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:02:45
Im not new, and I'm familiar with the type of post you're referring to but bitcoin isn't alt? And doesn't commonly shoot up a grand in a week, I'm hoping accumulation occurs without going sub 5K. 
Cheer up lad, those newbs you speak of made you (and I) money 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:21:47
Okay...let me play devils advocate here to the extreme here...even if garzik isn't successful, using the same methodology of masked Trojan nodes, what's stopping someone else from grinding the bitcoin system to a halt or incredibly slow amount to a point where the price is artificially decreased?  To a point where rapid buys can be transacted right after "flipping off" the turbulent nodes? Doesn't that invalidate the closed network in &amp; of its self? 
Someone please school me because I'm losing faith in everything here
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:21:14
Definitely in agreement. Thanks for adding for others that do not quite understand

andddd do you know how many people are over there? Im predicting bit coins will reach $500 by June 2014. Hold me to it!

Does anyone ever think that we consumers speculate so much about what idea Apple has next that we *create* sound ideas for them to use?
*i wasn't thinking that, but now that you mention it we could...*

I was being rather conservative...
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:07:16
Came back to say that you were right. I was being *way* to conservative. Hope you cashed in!
