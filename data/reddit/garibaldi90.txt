No he isn't saying that. Users still need to run the new software. Bitcoin is a combination of multiple forces clashing with each other.

Why is the tech subreddit always so negative towards crypto?

What's the fastest way to send money from Venezuela (any other shithole country) to South Korea on a Sunday night?

Well if they are short and BTC goes up 10x in a few days they are fucked.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:37:54
Why do you think BTC got a futures market and firms are pushing hard at passing an ETF?
Not to mention BTC will be the first asset to be delivered in the same day at ICE?
The news lie to you, focus on what corporations and rich people are actually doing.

Lol why is reddit full of retarded kids who took 1 econ class and they think they are Alan Greenspan reborn. GTFO you clearly have never even used Bitcoin and probably are a computer illiterate.

Yeah the system that almost imploded in 2008 and was only saved by enganing in extremely experimental and risky policies which are going to blow up again pretty soon.

It was just a buy the rumour sell the news. lol

He's a troll its pointless to argue with him
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:30:13
Yet they hail the banking system. lol

It isnt a super out of the way. Especially if you live in countries like Venezuela or Iran. Its hard af to take out your money.
The average transaction is currently 0.40 so yeah.
You said it literally has no use. 


Sure bro whatever you say. Bitcoin uses will become obvious as we get farther along this downward cycle. Remember you wont use BTC because you want. You will be forced to ;)

If you DYOR you will realize how little "experts" really know. Especially those that appear on TV.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:32:50
Well those wallets hadn't moved since 2015
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:10:10
Probably will go up 100x. That's why you have to be careful

Coinbase only had around 250k

Your daily reminder that you will lose ALL your Bitcoin if its not properly stored.
Many exchanges WILL get nationalized and many MANY computers will be hacked. 
Be ready guys, Bitcoin is not a fking joke. Watch Trace Mayer if you want to find out how to 100% secure your Bitcoin.

Sadly you cannot prove any of this through academia. That's whats complete bullshit about the system. It has so many defence mechanisms that its basically impossible to fight from the inside.
As he said the only way is to exit.

RT is 10x more truthful than any american news site, BUT
At the end of the day everything is propaganda. That's why you gotta DYOR.
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:03:05
Read some Taleb before you blow up ;)
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:01:09
That's what I want to know. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:02:32
What BS exactly? He tends to exaggerate some stuff for dramatic effect but his facts are pretty spot on.
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:01:12
When he says banker he means the fat cats that sit at the top of Chase, BoA, GS, etc etc
