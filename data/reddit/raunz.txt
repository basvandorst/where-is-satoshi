None fking cares about fees or transaction speeds, you think Roger Ver etc care, all they want is to control Bitcoin or make bcash dominant coin as they control fully.
AND to make more money. Greed got no limits, if you think they doing some holy crusade just LOL go back to selling cars.
Crypto will never become viable payment method for micro payments as you got no chargeback protection and that´s a fact, if you think otherwise you are dumb af.
This crypto thing is all speculation to make money as there is too much free money floating around because of negative interest rates.

First you rekt the shorts, get everyone to fomo in long then dump it to 1.2k and go sideways for 2 years until every single holder capitulates.
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:53:27
Bullish talk is 100% trolling....
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:27:13
No idea why the  is not capitulating yet, Beetcoin been bearish since 20k and will go retest top of the last bull run  see if that holds.If that holds new bull run will start but most alts need to die before that.

Right now Bitcoin is right at the spot where it could really brake out to mainstream but everyone who have done transactions daily knows this. 
You can send 10$ worth of bitcoin and end up paying 4$ is fees, that is actually insane.
If the fees dont go to ZERO then Bitcoin will never make it, right now bitcoin is like gold you just hold it but there is no actual economically viable use case for bitcoin other then holding and speculating.

Beetcoin very popular for gambling.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:32:57

Can you do USAF to change Bitcoin algorithm to asic resistant one to get rid of the shady miners?
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:31:33
If you believe Bitcoin is a threat to anything you not so smart.

Sepa transfer goes thru same day and don't cost anything with my bank and how many times people send money to foreign banks..as a currency bitcoin is useless for e-commerce or retail as there is no way to charge back transactions. Also right now people how don't know how to send btc cheap end up paying insane transfer fees even when sending small amounts.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:13:59
No freaking way, Bitcoin is a terrible form of money as it is right now, the transfer fees are insane on most sites and confirmation speed is up to 2 hours some days.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:27:05
Bitcoin will die if the transaction fees dont go to zero!
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:04:15
We can go down to 1.3k and test the last bull run all time high, in fact that is what i think will happen.
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:09:18
Did i hurt your feelings, are you a holder?
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:10:21
I did, easy money.
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:37:49
Why do you think Bitcoin is worth 6000$ ???
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:48:43
Soros will short this thing sub 1k... not good news.
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:28:17
Beetcoin worth a lot of money, big use for it can buy alts.
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:43:48
You people are delusional 
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:03:20
There is no lack of sellers what are you talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:23:48
Look at the chart, this thing is about to die.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:38:08
Big players buy Bitcoin OTC at a discount, only relatively small traders and plebs buy from exchanges.
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:12:18
Look at the volume on every exchange for BTC then you will see this is already dead.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:01:50
You people are cute.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:06:26
80% of the Bitcoin trading volume is now Tether, bad things will happen soon.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:54:17
Yes the end is near, its over boys
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:50:41
