if the % of money i lost was &gt;&gt; than the cost of legal fees...i'd be willing to cooperate.  but as it stands...until a class action suit is established by a major firm...i won't be pursuing litigation at this time.

Thanks Zane.  I've got hope for all in this situation.  I know it's a horrible situation and I feel incredibly stupid.  Unfortunate events like this in life only compound the chaos that we all feel in our day to day lives.  I try and look for ways to be more accountable in my own actions, irrespective if unfortunate events are out of my control.  The first and foremost being:  1) I won't be trading anymore an asset that is non insured without recourse of loss.  Even though, I have only USD holdings on Bitfinex, I don't feel too confident in the exchange's ability to come back online to allow withdrawals at this time until I hear otherwise.
For all the trading people out there...I feel ya.  If you fear you've lost an enormous amount of BTC/life savings, you're not alone.  The whole BTC-USD trading community is in disarray.  Know that...in the long run...things will work out.  Keep your head up.  Regardless of the outcome with the exchange...remember what makes life worth living:  family and people in your life.  Money is but a tool to facilitate your relationships, which are the most important thing.  Godspeed everyone.

say you have 100 BTC.  what is the limit on withdrawals to fiat currency to convert to USD if Bitcoin ever takes a major crash?  would you have to incrementally convert or could you get it all out as USD at once?

anybody know if LTC, DRK or USD bankwire withdrawals are working?

Per email response:  "USD deposits/withdrawals are being processed normally."

completely asinine.  transfers have no bearing whatsoever on selling btc for usd on your exchange.  i recommend reconsideration as large holders of btc will not be pleased.  i hope you consider all solutions to IRS reporting within your power - as your business decisions with these matters will starkly influence how much future business you receive from large U.S. investors.

so this amounts to a scam on the part of bfx?  how long will it take for people to figure this out...and the price to dump (if it does)?
