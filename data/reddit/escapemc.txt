Along the topic of having to know German, would you be willing to pay for an employee to learn German if they had the other required skills?

Just a simple copy pasta of your username into Google gives a lot of results. EZ :P

This is so darn true I wish people would have listened to me before. I've been lurking around bitcoin for awhile now, and, well, no one would really listen to me much before 10k. I told several people to invest but they didn't think it would be successful. 
Now they are begging me to help them get on the train xD

I would say that both sides have good points, but still not too sure how they would convert the BTC into "fake BTC" being IOUs. 
Yes they might own BTC that they are given for the system, but giving out IOUs for BTC and basically making a whole new currency of BTCIOUs... Doesn't really work out.
Hoping what I am saying makes sense, I just took in the video and used what I know.
If anyone wants to point out if/why I am wrong about anything I said here, please use constructive criticism and don't blatantly say "boi you stupid and wrong"

No worries! I was just suggesting ways to get into it, but as you stated you already are! Have fun :P
and yeah r/Jobs4Bitcoin is great for searching around

If you have a good GPU for a computer, you can run Nicehash to get a low amount of money for just running your computer when you're not using it.
But really, Nicehash mining isn't the best. Sure it's easy to setup and run but eh.
If you really want to start trying to invest, you should talk to your parents who are over 18 to make an account that you use/manage or something. 
Happy hodling!

I will be kind here and try to give you my input on Mining.
Mining can be semi-profitable, but that only depends on a few factors.
As of now, we are still "mining" the remaining of the 21 Million BTC out for people to use. That is part of it all.
Anyway, the other part is securing the transactions of the users of BTC. We get paid a fee for securing it.
So, mining in a sense can make you some money. But don't expect anything major to come to you.
Here is some information I have acquired myself from tests I have done:
Because I didn't want to make my life hard, I used NiceHash to GPU mine. Yes, these are altcoins. I know, but you do get paid in BTC. So I am ok with it.
I have 2 GTX 1080s, and am currently making roughly $9 USD a day. This has changed a lot however, as when BTC was at 8K I was only making roughly $7-7.5 USD a day.
A GTX 1080 for a good price new is $499, so by itself a 1080 pays for itself in about 110 days, EXCLUDING the price of electricity, which is out next factor.
If you have a reasonable price for electricity you will be making more. A standard price for electricity is about $0.10 per kWh (kilowatt hour). You can find your price on your electric bill, sometimes labeled as Uses or Usage. A great price is anywhere from 0.00-0.05, a good price is 0.06-0.1, and anything 0.11-0.14 is ok, and anything higher is bad. 
From tests I have done and am happy to share with you, GPU mining can making about $13 a day if you invest roughly $2500 into a rig. ASICs are a cheaper, more efficient way, however, they are harder to get. Bitmain is a great place to get them, as the ones they make are on the top.
Another factor is mining in a pool, which has the potential to make you more, but they usually charge a small fee (1-5% normally).
Anyway, I hope this helped you!
Happy mining!
If you have any other questions, I am glad to try to answer them. There is so much that really cannot just be said easily right now haha.
I definitely recommend looking into this yourself and really finding out if this is something you want to do.
Might I add there are several ways to mine, not just through GPUs or NiceHash or etc...

Ya know, this is really very true. I myself traveled this path, and I wish my friends and family would too!
Most of them are stuck on Skepticism and Curiosity because they don't want to look into it (Self-Study)
