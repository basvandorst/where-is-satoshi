FYI, AB 1326 is a California state bill in the state legislature, so the folks you want to call are your state representatives and state senators, not your federal congresspersons. The link OP posted us to find your U.S. House representative and they're not involved in this at all. This is the link you want:

The most important thing to do is to make sure he learns well how the technology works and to clear up any misconceptions he may have. Questions of how custody can differ between Bitcoin and the legacy financial system tend to come up with policymakers. Happy to go into more detail with you if you ping me. Good luck!

You are such a dishonest man, As I said to you on Twitter yesterday, the bill we proudly helped craft is this version of AB 1326, last amended on August 18, 2015:
It was as good a bill as we could get, it was deregulatory (i.e. it would have resulted in fewer regs for bitcoin companies than the status quo without the bill), and it would have benefited the ecosystem.
On Monday, that bill was amended with completely new language. What this means (if you can get it through your head) is that while the bill number remains the same, the language that we proudly helped craft was stripped out of the bill and replace with new language that was obviously bad for bitcoin. 
This is the bill as amended on Monday, August 8, 2016:
Do you see all that crossed out text? That was the old AB 1326 that we helped craft and that we stand behind. Do you see all that italicized text that wasn't in the August 2015 version I linked to above? That's the new AB 1326 that we had nothing to do with. The one I and my colleagues at Coin Center have spent the past week working our asses off to kill. Stop saying that it's the same bill and that we asked for it or wrote it. 
If you're too dumb to understand that a bill can have the same bill number as an old bill and still be a completely different new bill, I'm very sorry for you. I just hope the rest of the community can understand.

When and where are you meeting Jerry Brito? He doesn't have it on his calendar. ;o)

I tangoed with him a couple of weeks ago at a Bretton Woods event here in DC. Gave him a piece of my mind. :) You can listen on the first panel here:
He begins talking at minute 35 and then I respond.

I'm not so sure the Remedies document is so crystal clear about whether the protocol will be changed or not. Today in her [speech]( the FinCEN director repeated it: "Ripple Labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the Ripple Protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions."

I think it's more accurate to say that there is only one transaction generally recognized to have been initiated by Satoshi. And as far as I can tell, we only believe this because we trust Hal Finney's account of the transaction.

Coin Center ED here. Actually, we were on top of it. We compiled the below doc and distributed it widely to media beginning in mid-April. 
We walked the Economist through that doc before they published and as a result they asked CW for cryptographic proof he could not supply, hence the Economist's skeptical take.
After the CW announcement we spent days fielding media questions and explaining how no verifiable cryptographic proof was supplied. We had about 550 media hits last week--all with the message of 'don't fall for it.' 
That's part of what we do for the bitcoin ecosystem every day.

Here's a recording of the hearing:
Unfortunately it's WMA. If someone knows how to convert it to MP3, I'd very much appreciate it!
