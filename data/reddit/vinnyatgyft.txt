Do you guys actually know what convertible debt is?? It could convert to equity at a fixed price (current valuation) and the holders can hold for up to 10 years or redeem. Effectively forces them to repay or dilute the shareholders.

Please private message me your details so that I can look into it.  This is very unusual.
CEO, Gyft
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:41:06
Which speaks to a point I made on a comment a couple of months ago:
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:12:28
Target have specifically requested that the barcodes are only displayed on mobile devices.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:59:34
And this one:  
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:04:24
Thanks David - would love to hear your ideas - please pm me!
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:50:22
It's not financial, it's technical. Most of these smaller retailers do not have scanners that can work on a mobile phone.  The best thing to do is tell them you want to use Gyft, and let them contact us.
@_date: 2014-01-03 00:02:44
We trust our customers :-)
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:29:29
And get 3% back in points!
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:42:27
Yes, this is often the case and specific to certain merchants or payment methods where the points are sponsored. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:07:19
This is not a Gyft limitation. Our bar codes can be generated custom per store location if needs be. GYFT works perfectly at any Target store, for example, as Target have worked with us closely to provide us the necessary encoding specifications.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:03:37
Not yet...but working on it... :-)
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:32:47
No, but you get 3% points back when buying gift cards with Gyft :-)
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:20:50
We're looking into this - please email support with any android issues and mark it for my attention - thanks! Vinny
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:38:29
See elsewhere on this thread :-)
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:19:36
That is correct. I made this point in my comment about off-book purchases. Also, let's not confuse wallet account creation with mainstream consumer adoption.
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:40:44
Vinny guy here :-) You paged?
So, we're just introducing Google Wallet this past few weeks and we're doing a special promotion on it.  It's only available on Android for Google+ users.  When we run a points promotion it's usually sponsored in some way as we don't have the margins for higher than 3% total. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:24:44
Based upon historicals.  Bitcoin has historically never gone below about a 40% premium to the previous peak, once a breakout happens.  I didn't want to get into technical chart analysis in this piece.
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:10:52
Thanks - but like I said, don't tell us, tell them:
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:03:11
Yup, as of right now, we're only 18 people.  That will change shortly though with the recent announcement :-)  Thanks for your support guys!
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:38:12
Hold on...it's coming... these are test cards (they work, but we're testing before increasing the size).
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:21:59
That statement is not consistent with the data I am seeing.
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:42:24
This is fixed - thanks for letting us know!
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:21:00
Without gift cards you couldn't get 3% in points back...
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:55:20
It's actually a Coinbase specific problem with payments made from their wallets to Bitpay specifically. You should let them know about it - we have many customers complaining about this and it's only Coinbase -&gt; Bitpay where we are seeing any problems with payments.  All other wallets process perfectly to Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:51:26
It's going to be another cracker of a Friday :-)
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:58:31
You may have missed this:
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:19:12
It's not a Gyft problem.  Try using Gyft at Target.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:08:46
Yeah, thanks! That's not going to happen ;).  We may have to increase or reduce points on certain merchants over time based upon terms we get from them and their policies, but if there is a change, Bitcoin will always be most favored ;)
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:04:08
Our user data is proprietary and we do not provide it to any retailer.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:51:12
Not at this point, but it is higher than other retailers have stated.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:56:30
We are going to be bringing out V2 of our Android app in the next 2 months.  We'll probably deprecate V1 and remove gifting features like camera and video recording, which is what requires the microphone access, etc.  Please be patient - it's the most efficient use of our time right now.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:50:37
We do keep a percentage of Bitcoin sales (to pay for advertising and other services). The point is that that is a choice not related to exchange rate risk.
@_date: 2014-03-12 13:33:03
Hi - which version of the app were you using?  We have made a number of improvements recently.
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:58:01
Couldn't agree with you more.  That's why Gyft gives back 3%!
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:57:19
We're busy restocking cards - apologies for the delay, our sales are continuing to grow at a crazy rate :-)
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:41:26
Hey Guys.  Thought I'd weigh in here.  Gyft Cloud will not enable Bitcoin, per se.  It will allow smaller merchants to sell gift cards directly to their own customers.  Over time (i.e. not next month :-) ), we will allow these merchants to sell cards via Gyft.com (which will then by default enable Bitcoin purchases). If merchants want to use Bitpay to sell cards in store, then that's absolutely fine but we are not getting into the processing space at a merchant level for payments - that's up to the individual merchants.
Our goal with Gyft Cloud is to allow the 90% of smaller businesses out there who don't have gift card programs to start participating in the gift card wave!
@_date: 2014-04-15 05:19:08
It's not a Gyft problem anymore as we do not support their cards.  I also did not say you have to buy a card - you can also upload existing Target cards to us to test.
The experience you were describing was accurate for certain percentage of their stores that did not have next generation scanners installed yet. We cannot outfit stores with the correct scanners.
The inability to check balances is always as a result of the merchant of record refusing to give access to 3rd party providers because they do not want to pay the 1c charge that their technology providers charge them for balance enquiries.
In theory, it is a Gyft problem.  In reality, even if we offered to pay the 1c charge (and we do), the treasury departments refuse to give access because that's not how they do business currently and they wouldn't even know how to bill us.
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:30:40
Thanks! :-) I'll buy something cool for the office!
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:49:34
Nope, our current run rate is way more than even double that number, excluding Q4 which is peak season for gift cards.
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:41:16
As long as the codes are unused, we will issue you with a full refund.
Please send an email to support and mark it for my attention.  I apologize that you were under the impression that the cards were valid in Canada as they are all priced in US Dollars. I will see how we can communicate that better.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:06:31
Sorry you feel that way.
@_date: 2014-03-25 05:32:10
Could you give me some more specific feedback? What's the problem you are having with it?
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:19:38
This is actually a Google Play error. Many apps are reporting this and Google does not yet have a fix.
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:17:01
This post was not widely read, so you may have missed it, but I believe Gyft to be more of a Bitcoin company than any other retailer out there today...
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:04:00
We are a private company and this information is proprietary. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:37:45
You got us.  We're still in testing mode, but should have many more the denominations up within the next day or two.  We just want to make sure everything works 100% before opening up more.  About regifting - I'll try to figure out how to display that better from a UX perspective (might take a while though, so please be patient).
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:31:30
Sorry for the confusion. The availability of the regifting functionality to our customers is decided by the participating retailer in our platform.
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:33:25
Please DM me your info and I will look into it. Apologies for the hassle here.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:43:17
We're trying - not as simple as it sounds...:-(
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:19:10
Apologies.  We are aware of the problem - Bitpay had some delays in confirming the transactions with us.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:56:15
This clown above is not me.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:26:40
Sorry for the bad experience. I am on it. Please pm your email address and details to me asap.
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:56:21
The biggest issue here is that we can't identify "unique" users with Bitcoin and opening up promotions to Bitcoin users leaves us open to abuse (which we see a lot of).  We continue to support the BTC community with special offers and deals, but unfortunately, not all deals can apply to BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:16:27
We only quote the prices given to us by Coinbase and BitPay - we don't set the exchange rate.  The choice is yours :-)
@_date: 2015-01-24 03:09:08
Some do.... (did you see the one at the Bitcoin Bowl? :-) ).  We target by demographic....
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:54:50
Hey Guys
I really apologize for the support hiccups.  We have been experimenting with outsourced support as we have grown massively, and unfortunately it has not been successful.  We will be working to improve this experience - please contact me if you have any more problems.
@_date: 2015-01-21 01:15:45
Yup - it's coming to iOS soon. We wanted to test on the web first. Later this quarter.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:14:06
Please let me know where. Maybe my spell checker didn't detect them. Worth noting that is am South African originally and this conform usually to UK English spellings 
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:10:59
The retailers discount their cards to us.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:08:34
In this case, I truly hope I'm wrong...

It's closer to 90%. Someone actually did the analysis on it!

Hi guys. We are currently experiencing some double spend attempts at Gyft. We have increased the confirmation requirements for now while we fix this issue we are experiencing with Bitpay. We also have Coinbase integration on our web app where we are not experiencing any issues at the moment and card issuances are instant. Apologies for the inconvenience, but we do understand the issues and are actively trying to resolve it.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:25:51
Thanks for your feedback.  An unintended consequence of us launching an affiliate program was that users were double dipping to earn both points AND cashback. Our policy is to pay our affiliates a commission, which they may share in the form of a cashback or we offer our users Gyft Points. We cannot economically do both concurrently, so we have had to change our terms with our affiliates, who paid the cashback, not our end users.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:42:17
Sorry about the hassle - making some big improvements here - and should fix this shortly.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:41:45
We're on it - sorry about that!  Version 2 was a bit leaner than I would have liked.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:50:34
If you click on a cashback site, the points are disables as you are opting for their rewards program. If you come directly to us, you will get Gyft Points. You will find your earnings info at checkout.

I think my gold short call has been pretty good so far...

Thanks for the quick pickup and discussion. This is definitely a phishing scam.

That's not right. Please direct message me - you should have received it.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:49:25
Thanks! Agreed. Markets correct. I'm not with Gyft anymore - 
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:50:29
As I pointed out in my blog post about the 1% not using exchanges, I was shocked that we broke $725 and went to $770. There seemed reason to believe that $700 was no longer the hard line and therefore we would run all the way to $1151. I think it just took a while to the sellers (cold storage coins or OTC trades) to wake up and come into the market - which pushed the price back down. Predictions are always hard but when I said $700 was a major line of resistance I really meant it and it's proven out. The next time we break it in a sustainable way - it should clear the path to $1k+.
Because exchanges are often thinly traded prices can spike beyond price prediction bands temporarily - I did not expect it to go 10% above though, and clearly it was not sustainable. I reflected on it, hence my 1% post.
Hope that clears it up. Even if you say that my tweet was wrong - read all my other blog posts over the years. Tweets are spontaneous, blog posts take time and deep thought.
@_date: 2016-07-28 14:03:29
Not entirely unexpected!

No - you can use it in store and redeem from your mobile device, we just don't have the cards available for purchase in our apps yet (technical reasons).  You can buy on the web, reveal the code and then use your phone in the store to redeem.

Yes! :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:17:44
I previously [posted this]( on reddit, and thought I would just do a repost here, given the question posted:
Gyft is a strong innovator, believer and supporter of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We've had a great year, in which we started accepting Bitcoin way back in May, raised $5m in funding and released Gyft Points (3% points back for Bitcoin users!).
Today we are announcing our further commitment.
For the rest of this year and for the foreseeable future. We are going to be storing our all net margin earned in Bitcoin. This means that when you purchase a gift card from us, we will only sell an amount of Bitcoin into the marketplace (via Bitpay) that is needed for us to replenish our gift card inventory (our suppliers only take fiat at the moment).
We already spend Bitcoin to pay some of our service providers (for instance, we already do this for a lot of our advertising) and by storing more of our margin in Bitcoin, it gives us even more reason to pay in Bitcoin. This will further reinforce our contributions to the Bitcoin economy.
Again, thank you for all your support and feedback - we hope this small announcement will help pave the way for other companies to also take the same approach to their business and join us in continuing to reinforce the Bitcoin ecosystem!
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:57:06
Sorry to hear - this not the standard experience.  Could you email our support email so that we can follow up with you and make it right.
@_date: 2013-05-19 01:36:09
Thanks! It's coming - actually very high on our radar. Due to our merchant agreements we can never discount cards below face value - but we will be offering loyalty points later this year...;). All the support we are getting is really helping us build new features and Improving our service! Thanks!

Hi - we apologize.  There were issues last related to our connection to Bitpay - it has been resolved. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:18:30
Whether or not you use Gyft or are able pay the store directly, the following cashflow would hold true for all retailers, at least until everyone (companies, service providers, and employees) around the world are all earning and storing BTC.
Typical company profile
Sales : $100
Cost of goods sold : $40 (unless suppliers accept BTC), it's fiat (40%)
Labor :  $20 (unless employees accept BTC), its fiat (20%)
Taxes : $20 - you ask Uncle Sam to accept BTC (20%)
Marketing : $10 - again, publishers want fiat, mostly
Profit: $10 (assuming an average of 10% profits) - that's the only eligible portion that could be recirculated in BTC.
The reality is that when it comes to spending BTC, right now, invariably almost all becomes fiat - but over time, it's been less BTC as the BTC/fiat prices have risen.
Now for all the companies we work with, most of them are major, listed companies and would never store their profit in bitcoins. The difference really is that Gyft does.
The key point here is that, yes, in an ideal world, everyone would accept BTC and when you spend it with them, it recirculates.  But, we don't live in an ideal world, however, at least we at Gyft store our profits in Bitcoin and we also spend our marketing dollars in BTC where possible.
We also give employees bitcoins in addition to their salaries.  I think we do a much better job of honoring the best interests of the Bitcoin economy, than just about any company out there.  Again, a big thank you to the r/Bitcoin for all your support!
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:51:30
Thanks - this is already in the works, but will only be available in 2014.

Thanks again for being persistent about using Gyft and being a loyal customer - much appreciated.  We are working on doing retailer education to help improve this.  
Also, CVS is not Online only - do not listen to the store clerks.  If they select "gift card" in their terminals and scan the screen or enter the code, it will work.
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:45:00
Remember, Gyft keeps a portion of all sales in BTC and circulates it within the BTC economy (we pay for advertising and other services in BTC).  We also keep a portion of the profits in BTC.  Even if retailers did accept BTC directly, they would not be doing this.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:04:28
Unfortunately, the problem of being a company that's pushing the envelope and ahead of the curve, is that there are some people still trying to catch up - with your support - we'll get there!  We guarantee all the cards that we sell - manual cards are unfortunately outside our control.

@_date: 2013-09-27 01:02:20
We're not allowed to sell new gift cards below face value as we buy direct from the source, and not second hand discounted, compromised codes/cards.  We only buy secure codes on newly issued cards (which means the codes you see are only seen by human eyes when you see them).  This means the codes are guaranteed to work - this also means that our margins are razor thin.  That said, we're working on something :-)
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:40:03
that's a very humbling statement...thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:33:53
Working on it! 
@_date: 2013-09-27 01:00:00
Gyft is a gifting application, so we require more information to give users a great experience and gift to their friends. We need the microphone because we allow users to send a video message with their gift cards.  Unfortunately, we cannot release different versions for different use cases.  
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:11:33
Thanks! You and all the other redditors out there can help by getting retailers to know about and use Gyft!
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:38:54
Email them - it's best when they hear from their customers to join us! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:24:48
Need time - we're a small team :-)
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:50:03
For a $1,000 purchase, you would receive 3,000 points which can be redeemed for a $30 gift card which would equate to 3% of your original spend.  Hope that makes sense.  And yes, we are backdating it!
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:38:00
This is awesome to hear...glad that Gyft is helping to make your life better!  Stay tuned for some big news next week ;-)
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:48:16
Thanks for your feedback and your business!  Where you using the mobile app or our web app?
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:55:38
Can you email support and we will check into it for you.  It should be within a couple of minutes (we run a process on the backend to credit back).
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:48:51
Hi. We don't sell Taco Bell cards?  Was it a manually entered card?

Enquiries vs Inquiries:
@_date: 2013-07-29 18:03:02
Right now, yes.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:44:11
Not sure if you saw my post [last week](
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:17:43
Thanks to you too - you have been an awesome supporter and doing great things!
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:48:37
Please email support - we need to debug this for you
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:34:42
Thanks for your comments.  For many reasons (including accounting, security, managing cashflow, etc) , retailers cannot accept Bitcoin directly or through a PSP, and therefore work with us to bring their cards to market.   For instance, we ran a promotion where Zeevex purchases got up to 5% points back for Bitcoin purchases - Zeevex sponsored that deal with us.
There is also nothing preventing Bitpay or Coinbase from accepting another alt.  We have looked at it and we still have a lot of concerns around alt currencies and looking at our roadmap, it's unlikely we will make a solo move to other alt currencies without a general uptake in the broader market (i.e. Bitpay and Coinbase would really have to make the first move here).  I can't rule it out, but there is a lot that needs to happen for an alt to make it's way onto Gyft.
If retailers wanted fractional hedging on Gyft, they would accept BTC directly.  They don't.  That's just the reality of it.
We believe that we strengthen the BTC economy by allowing users to keep as much BTC as they want in BTC, and only spend as they need. If you were holding coins and needed money on a saturday night, all the banks are closed - it would take 3-4 days at least to get fiat.  This alone is a great strength as it bypasses the traditional banking system (you also don't need a bank account to have a Gyft wallet + Bitcoins).
 
Hope this helps you understand our viewpoint, somewhat.
@_date: 2013-06-11 07:08:05
Yes- you can use  to access the web app
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:46:50
Hi - we use Bitpay to process our payments and they have mentioned that the network has been congested lately with the surge in volume.  What happened in your case is a rare event.  I also suggest that you add a small fee to your transaction (wallet setting in blockchain) to speed it up - it needs to reach us within 15 minutes.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:13:30
Email jobs with your resume...
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:07:39
Unfortunately not - this is not our retailers are setup (we pre-purchase pre-set amounts in bulk quantities in some cases).
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:57:17
We just loaded up to $500 cards for Zeevex - thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:08:12
It's coming in early 2014...promise...
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:31:18
Gyft also supports [Charity Choice]( gift cards.
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:33:10
Just FYI, that card was not from us...someone must have re-gifted it to you previously and it was in your account when you set it up.
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:06:35
Thanks - we're working on it!
@_date: 2013-06-23 04:08:55
Gyft now allows customers from all countries to purchase international cards, such as GameStop, direct from our website. Our apps are being rolled out internationally in Q3 2013, but for now, the website is available globally.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:57:51
Yes, next year.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:51:10
I'm taking notes - thanks.  We can definitely improve - the company only launched 15 months ago, and we have been moving as quickly as possible to onboard tons of retailers and expand our product offering (points, etc).  Now that the Xmas season is at a close, I think we will have more time to focus on improving these niggly issues which affect some of our customers.  Thanks for your feedback - expect some improvements in this area.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:15:10
Thanks for the support - we're trying our best!
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:36:23
Site ordering coming within the next week...
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:59:44
We are thinking along the same lines.... I can't say more at this stage :)
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:04:37
Yes in 2014.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:36:39
Thanks for the post - if you are happy now, wait until you hear the news we are announcing next week (actually 2 bits of news... :-) )
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:42:22
Gyft is generally instant, 98% of the time - but occasionally, it will take a few minutes.  If you ever have any issues - just call us!
@_date: 2013-05-18 21:57:39
For various reasons, we need to have an account. We are working on giving other options - but you will always need to have an account to make a purchase. You can use our card storage features on our apps with no account.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:59:59
Hi - we just released that change, and now noticing the subtleties - we're busy assessing internally - we may revert to the previous system. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:04:09
Thanks - no creepiness intended.  It was the fastest way for us to launch as a startup - but now we built our own user management system, so it's an add-on.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:37:41
We are a private company, and we don't release that information - sorry.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:50:34
Because, when you are running a startup, you never stop working... :-)
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:44:09
We're trying hard :-) great to hear - thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-16 07:14:49
Gyft charges no fees, ever.  We use Bitpay to process transactions at faor market rates (not MtGox rates).
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:33:36
Gyft keeps a portion of the spend in Bitcoins...we have to convert most of it back to fiat to replenish our inventory.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:30:26
Hey Afrotec.  We are definitely looking into this down the line.  We can already offer this, but it needs to be supported by our merchants. I totally agree with you though!
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:42:30
That's correct - the 4% was a once off - Bitcoin Black Friday promotion.  You still get 3% back on everything though :-)
@_date: 2013-09-20 23:34:40
I wish it were easier to roll out internationally.  Unfortunately there are so many laws and regulations that we have to comply with it was just not possible.  Also, most of the retailers in foreign countries just do not have systems capable of handling non-physical card redemption.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:53:23
We are working on the permissions issue - it relates to having features like "video messaging" and "send to a friend" which require advanced permissions.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:18:23
We have a video messaging option when sending a card - you can record video greetings to your friends - very social and popular feature! Try it out!
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:44:01
Actually, we have that coming soon to the homepage... 
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:52:09
Yes, if you have enough.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:52:58
In the first half of 2014
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:04:19
With all the support we're getting - we're going to go from 200 to 2,000 (ok, maybe a bit less :-)) merchants in the next year, globally... Thanks redditors!
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:28:09
Don't worry about us - we only keep our profits in BTC.  We exchange BTC to fiat for replenishing our inventory. Spend away!
@_date: 2013-05-27 04:47:59
Hey Joe ;)
Right now, the only limitation in us bringing on more retailers, is them agreeing to distribute via Gyft. We onboard all retailers who request inclusion in our platform - we are not the problem! We have many who have turned us down as they do not accept mobile redemption...
 :)
@_date: 2013-09-27 01:04:56
Thanks.  We are really trying hard to get grocers on board.  The more the community reaches out to them and tell them to support Gyft, the sooner we can get them to convert to mobile :-)
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:38:50
Thanks for your comments.  Here is what we do and why.
Gyft is primarily is gifting application that allows users to upload, buy and send gift cards and remember them when they are shopping.  I realize that Bitcoin users have a more narrow use case.
Android does not currently allow us to request progressive permissions, so we have to request everything upfront to cover all possible use cases of the app.
1. Location :  We are rolling our location based services soon that will help you locate gift cards for stores close to you.  Also, when someone sends you a gift, we can narrow down the options that they can send to you to stores that are nearby.
2.  Camera :  Gyft allows you to upload (take photos) of physical gift cards that you may own. We are working on a barcode scanner too for this.
3. Retrieve Running Apps:  We integrate directly with 3rd party apps such as Samsung Wallet, so that you can push your gift cards into their wallet if you would like.
4. Contacts - well for sending gift cards to friends, we kinda need this.
5.  Microphone :  Did you know that you can send video messages attached to a gift card to a friend?!  We kinda need the camera and microphone here too!
I appreciate all the concerns, and we in no way want to take your information and abuse it (we have strict privacy policy), but we also want to offer the best and most innovative services to all our users (although bitcoin users have a different profile).
Remember, you can do all that you need to do with Gyft from a mobile browser (app.gyft.com) without needing to install an app.
However, in light of the concerns, here is what we are considering doing next year.  We going to investigate bringing out a "Gyft lite" version.  This version will have very stripped down features (basically, just buying and redemption).
We have raised the issue of progressive permissions (i.e. only asking for permissions if you want to use that feature) with the Android team - and if that could happen sooner, then we wouldn't need the companion app.
Again, thanks for the feedback and I hope this answer satisfies your questions.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:53:36
we also just launched Lord &amp; Taylor : 
@_date: 2013-05-19 00:57:08
Starbucks is on its way! The more support we get the more retailers we can convince to join us!
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:52:39
Thanks - the UK &amp; Canada are our next markets.  We will be there in 2014.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:19:23
Have you tried our video messaging feature?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:48:54
Ok - we should have up to $200 by Monday!
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:26:23
Oh right.  The promotions are ways to earn extra points - for example, we have a brand that's going to sponsor 5x points (5%) for Btc users in the coming weeks...
So, spend those points away! :-) 
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:43:25
Yes - Gyft works 100% with Papa John's Pizza
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:46:29
That's pretty much all we are doing ;). Don't tell us though - tell the retailers on Twitter - they are listening ;)
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:48:47
Yes, soon...
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:51:51
We think the current financial system and incentives are broken.  Why should someone who pays with a credit card get better value than someone who is paying with cash or Bitcoin.  We're trying to fix that.
@_date: 2013-05-15 05:32:46
US only right now - UK coming soon (around Q3)
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:42:06
We're working on bringing Petsmart on board...
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:45:41
While I appreciate your comment - I just wanted to make it clear to the community, who continually email us, comment about us and talk to us, that this is not something that within our direct control.  
Sending more requests to us will not bring their favorite retailers on board and we're not prepared to buy and resell second hand codes from some of those dodgy websites where we can't guarantee the codes will work.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:57:07
Prepaid: We already support a number of prepaid phone services, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, Tracfone, etc
Not on the immediate horizon - as I mentioned in my note, getting into second hand codes is very risky.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:27:55
That's for being a great customer!
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:13:17
I think you are confusing us with another company :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:37:48
Thanks - I'll have the team check this out asap.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:50:02
If only this were up to us...
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:06:18
Thanks.  We don't sell Target right now, but we do support their existing cards.
In general, if you don't see a merchant on Gyft - it's not because we don't want to - it's because we just launched 7 months ago and we're trying to convince them all to come on board yet - we're adding more every week though.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:17:48
Hi! Thanks for asking - let me point out what Gyft does do:
1. We store our profits in BTC and only convert to fiat the amounts that we have to pay our suppliers/rent/opex, for ones that don't accept BTC.
2. We give our employees BTC.
3. We spend BTC directly in the BTC economy where possible (advertising on BTC websites etc).
4. We sponsor and pay for Bitcoin events in BTC.
5. We give all the savings versus paying with a credit card (3%) back to our users - even resulting in a loss on some brands.
We are here to build and support the BTC economy. I also personally hold and spend Bitcoins regularly and consider myself one of the earliest adopters and believers in BTC - before it got all the media hype.
We at Gyft are doing our best to take BTC mainstream and I think we will do a better job of contributing to its growth than any other retailer out there - because we actively reinvest in the BTC economy more than any of them will.
Quite frankly, the only way going directly to a retailer would be better is if they paid their employees, suppliers and rent in BTC (and stored their profits there too) - but good luck with that...:)
Vinny Lingham
CEO, Gyft
@_date: 2013-09-20 23:35:24
I'll give you a hint:  Some type of loyalty program :-)
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:36:03
Over time, we believe the spread between Bitpay &amp; MtGox (and all the exchanges) is going to converge.  Right now, given the volatility, the spreads are wider.  Also, you can't get dollars out of MtGox, so that is not a fair price.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:11:00
Thanks - I just posted a further response [here](
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:26:21
It's coming - technical issues :-)
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:42:32
Sorry - it actually sits on our books as a company liability, so we can't maintain them for too long...
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:03:36
I'm not sure I understand the question/context?
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:05:21
That's the idea!
@_date: 2013-09-27 00:57:14
Working on it.  We need retailers to support us there first.  Speak to them :-)
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:00:03
I know - we were also bummed by it...  it's a decision they made (not just us, but all consumer channels).
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:21:56
It's only on our web app until next week
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:42:38
We're probably going to give away 4-5 given the number of responses that we got...underpromise, overdeliver...
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:01:22
Our points policy is that any points earned in 2013 expires Dec 31 2014. I.e. 1 full calendar year plus the remainder of the year you are in. Fair?
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:02:35
Thanks so much for the kind words. Our goal is to accelerate mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, and rewarding people for doing it.
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:03:25
Another thing on our to do list  :-)
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:43:08
It's coming soon!
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:33:48
Can't argue with that! ;-)
@_date: 2013-06-12 04:19:27
We never charge fees...ever!
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:19:26
Have you tried using Coinbase to buy coins (US only)?
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:48:16
You can use the code from within the web app to redeem at any of our supported stores.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:41:56
Next year...
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:15:01
Our cards only work on Amazon.com - if Amazon.com services your region, then they should work.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:25:33
Just a quick correction - Gyft is a private company backed by some top tier venture capital firms including Google Ventures.  We are not owned by Walmart.
@_date: 2013-07-29 06:05:21
Thanks!  Please rally any and all retailers to grant us authorization to sell their gift cards!
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:59:04
Hi. I can't comment on what the various platforms allow - but I can say that we will be releasing purchasing in our website and through a mobile browser for all devices, hopefully before the end of this week - stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:08:18
Yes, but only 1 point per dollar spent. Also, you get 2 points per dollar on Paypal paid purchases.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:50:45
Thanks - we will keep that in mind!  
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:09:04
Please email me - not sure which ticket is yours. My email is my reddit user name 
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:49:17
The retailers reimburse us for sending them new customers who spend the gift cards with them...
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:11:41
Sorry - I just saw this now.  Would love to get NewEgg on board - any ideas?
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:48:08
Hi Chris - it's coming (as soon as is possible)...we're working around the clock to get out as many ways to use Gyft!
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:34:38
I made this [announcement]( yesterday, but it went unnoticed :-)
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:33:39
Very simple, in many parts of the world, miners get free electricity...
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:04:27
Yes - we allow users to use any browser (mobile or desktop) to make a purchase. Once the card is in your account - you can access the wallet from any app. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:04:23
These rates fluctuate all the. We use BitPay and their rates are market dependent. You also cannot get cash out of MtGox. Also, you can wait a couple of days for you cash, or get a gift card for instant used your choice, as always.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:17:26
We use the BitPay API's to determine the exchange rate - so whatever price the market is trading at (it's usually within 50c per $100 of the spot price).  We pay the BitPay fees, so there is no additional cost to the buyer.
@_date: 2013-10-07 22:14:28
Sorry for the delay - which wallet were you paying from?
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:26:21
You can access app.gyft.com from any web browser and on any phone!
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:43:14
Thanks - much appreciated!
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:15:24
Web purchasing is coming within the next week...
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:18:44
We'll have it on our website soon - but it's listed in the app for now. Sorry about that!
@_date: 2013-10-18 03:14:45
Check again - it should be live for everyone. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:58:57
This is another area we are looking into.  We actually have a technology partner that has this tech...
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:35:07
At Gyft, we set the number of confirmations to 0 for most transactions - so it's instant.  The only lag is the time is takes for your wallet to Bitpay - many wallet providers charge fees, and if the incorrect amount is sent, it won't process.  I highly recommend Blockchain.info as a wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:26:22
Thanks!  We are adding "Buy a card" for yourself tomorrow to the app - it's been on our list, but you're right - we didn't realize the demand for it until now!
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:11:20
I can't comment :-)
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:39:35
Gyft is a 12 person company - hardly a corporate ;)
@_date: 2013-07-29 19:40:48
Please contact us at support - we will help you resolve this issue.  Have you tried accessing your web wallet :  app.gyft.com
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:02:42
Unfortunately not - it's only Amazon.com right now.
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:30:37
Yes - check our jobs page ;)

Drop an email to info for my attention please so that I can look into what the issue was for you - sorry to here there was a delay!
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:47:46
It should be within 5 seconds...try refreshing?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:00:58
You get 3% Gyft Points back on all gift card purchases, which you can spend on future purchases.
@_date: 2013-07-19 02:50:56
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:53:10
Actually, this statement is not entirely correct.  Gyft keeps all the profit margin we earn in Bitcoin. We sell BTC for fiat to replenish our inventory with retailers, because ultimately the retail stores need fiat to pay their employees, taxes, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:06:27
Thanks for all your support!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:54:48
Have you tried upgrading your version of Google Play. That is where we are seeing some problems. Please let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:13:01
Unfortunately not - but we are looking into it next year.
@_date: 2013-05-26 16:26:01
Gyft is available on all mobile devices, via our mobile web app at

That is correct!  We're passing the savings onto the consumer for adopting Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:47:51
Yes, I have heard of it (I am part of Bitangels). I look forward to seeing it succeed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:40:04
No, we are adding it to the mobile apps next week! ;)

Apologies for this.  We'll get back to you tomorrow.  The coins are with Bitpay and they have been experiencing some issues today - we will resolve it with them in the morning, so do not worry.

We really are trying hard to onboard more retailers.  What we need is user activism!  Write, tweet, call and email the retailers that we don't have and tell them to join us and we digitize gift cards. We are not the bottleneck - we want them all on board!  You won't believe how difficult it is to get them to start using us - it's a very new concept for most of them!

We prefer Paypal over CC as the chargebacks and fraud risks are lower.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:56:03
No - we have just had unprecedented demand...
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:17:22
That's actually something we are looking at...stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:08:20
you are using an older version of Google Play, most likely. Please contact support and we can help.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:50:18
This is one area (buying back cards) that we are not focused on right now for various reasons, unfortunately.

As a Bitcoiner myself, I would be only too happy to see that day come.  That said, we are releasing some additional value adds that I don't think stores will offer - because we are ahead of the pack, I think we can continue to innovate and differentiate!
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:06:58
Yes! Our goal is to get 100% coverage of all major retailers...we're working as fast as we can...
@_date: 2013-05-12 16:28:34
Yup - we're working on it!  We're a small team that's trying to work as quickly as possible!  Thanks for the support guys!
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:27:26
Yes - we'll be there next year for sure.
@_date: 2013-06-30 03:14:03
We need Starbucks to still approve us as a retailer... Show your support for us and tweet them! We are not as big as Facebook, unfortunately.

Sure - create an account at gyft.com from your Canada IP address and we'll notify you as soon as we go live.

Surprisingly, a lot of effort to support multi currency, multi domain and multi-country legal compliance work.  There are also exchange controls in South Africa which we have to consider too... that said, it's one of the markets we will look to enter in 2014.  
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:04:46
Thanks - well spotted. It's fixed!
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:21:10
I would rather not comment on this, given the variety of different answers based upon your location and tax jurisdiction.  Every company is different and should seek professional tax advice.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:44:25
Argh- ok... they just raised $5m.  I think they fixed that problem though!
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:02:18
It should work for you. Please email support if you are still having this problem.
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:22:26
Thanks - it's a pleasure - my team is working around the clock to make these types of improvements to our service!
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:41:22
Hi - I apologize for that.  Please email support and we'll figure it out for you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:26:44
Please can you email support so that we can look into this bug for you.
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:12:50
Your math is incorrect.  You earn 4 points for every dollar you spend. If you spend $100 - you earn 400 points which equals $4 off your next purchase - which equals 4% of your $100 purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:58:23
Thank you for supporting us!!

We are looking at some workaround, but hopefully Google can fix it on their next Google Play update.  We might have a fix in the next Gyft Android version - due out in a week or so.  Apologies for the inconvenience - there are hundreds of other apps also affected.
@_date: 2013-09-27 01:05:15
Don't tell us, please tell them - we are trying, but they are not all friendly! :-)
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:56:12
Hi - sorry about that - it was a bug that is definitely fixed in the new version!
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:44:37
We are looking at giving away points, retroactively.  We are not sure what the final % will be, but it will almost very likely be backdated.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:55:57
Thanks for the feedback, we'll look into the browser issues on the kindle asap. In terms of a port - let me look into that.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:01:04
It's coming later this week... :-)
