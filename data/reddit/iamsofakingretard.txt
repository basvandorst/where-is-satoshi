The creditors should be the first ones to get their money back. What is left should go to the shareholders. If they are having to give creditors haircuts, then the shareholders should not have any equity left in the company. They should look for an outside investor to purchase the company and make creditors whole, or else bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:52:26


Yes this. Shareholders should only lose what they have invested.


Typically in the case of an insolvent company, the order of payout would be:
1. Secured Creditors
2. Unsecured Creditors (Depositers of Bitfinex in this case)
3. General Creditors (Stockholders/Shareholders)
If Bitfinex can raise funds, either through share issuance or debt financing, then they could make all their customers whole and continue their business. If they cannot raise capital, they cannot continue to run their exchange and force customers to take a haircut. [source](

You dont understand bitcoin
What about a stock certificate. Why does that have value? What about when they do a 2:1 stock split, now there are double the amount of shares outstanding, does that mean the company is worth double what it was before the split?


Let me get this straight, you agree that bitcoin has value, it is just difficult to convince the public of this because they might not understand it? or you dont think bitcoin has value?

@_date: 2015-12-14 21:24:42
volume will effect the spread on the exchanges. If there is little volume you may have to pay more to buy bitcoins and will recieve less to sell (possibly). Also if you are looking at buying $1000 or $100,000 worth, the volume on the exchange is important as you some exchanges may not have enough liquidity for you to purchase near current market prices.

following your logic, Paper is not scarce, it is made from trees which are growing up out of the ground all over the place. I look out my window and see hundreds of them. Try to convince the public that the paper you get from the bank is valuable. Bank paper is not limited naturally, only artificially, and such artificial limitations carry no value. 
I remember you from many months ago spouting this same bullshit. If you took the time to read and learn about bitcoin, money, medium of exchanges, you would not continue to repeat these false facts. Bitcoin works today and it has value, so your argument does not stand.
It is not about ones and zeros on the computer, it is what those ones and zeros represent that has value.

The blocksize cap was never meant to stay, it was intended to be removed. Did you read the whitepaper? 
It is called a bait and switch what is happening to bitcoin users. They were baited thinking the network would be like it states in the white paper, now it is being switched to somethins different.

It does not matter about character in open source software. What don't you understand about that? 
Open source software allows everyone to judge the software based on the code, not the individual who wrote it. Character is a subjective observation, the code is objective.

Increasing block size does not affect the mining difficulty for the miners. Increasing block size requires more hard drive space as well as bandwidth for the nodes

In the first, you dont worry about locking your door. Nobody worries about locking their door. As a result, when people are robbed, everybody in the neighborhood bears the cost of the replacing what was stolen. Not directly, but indirectly through hidden costs. Somebody is paying to replace all the stolen stuff, who is that?
In the second, you only have to worry about your house getting robbed. If your neighbours house gets robbed, you dont bear the cost directly nor indirectly. If you and everyone else in the neighbourhood takes the time to educate themselves on how to lock your door, although right now I dont think that every person in the neighbourhood is capable of learning how to lock their doors. When everyone is capable of locking their own door (through multi-sig and hardware wallets) then their will no longer be theft and you will no longer be subsidizing your neighbours who keep getting robbed.
Which way seems like a better long term solution?

Before a Tsunami hits the shore, the water recedes into the ocean leaving the beach bare, like it would be in low tide or even lower. If you were to see this you should run to higher ground as you would know a tsunami is coming. If you were ignorant to this then you might try to take advantage of the exposed beach and gather the pebbles, oblivious to the incoming tsunami.

@_date: 2015-03-24 20:27:37
yeah I understand that it is a self-regulating system in the long term. In the short term however, we are limited to the supply of mining hardware (ASIC's). That is why I don't see the price of bitcoin rising any faster than this hardware can be manufactured (this is best case scenario)

I do own some bitcoin but I am coming to the realization that it is not  economical or doesn't make sense for the price of bitcoin to increase past a certain level in the near future. Over the long term the price should gradually increase as block rewards halve, but who wants to wait years? Bitcoin is only a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things and we could have to wait many years just to see that little blip grow by a small amount, and maybe come close to displacing one of the current financial intermediaries. If it takes the next 6-10 years just for bitcoin to grow large enough to do the same amount of money transfer as say western union does now, is it worth it to be invested in bitcoin right now?

when the price of bitcoin was over $1000, it was not possible to just turn on more miners though. everybody wanted to get more miners to turn on. but where did you get them? there was a backlog. If we are to ever see a substantial price increase, then everybody would be turning on their miners. what happens when all the miners are turned on, yet the price of bitcoin is still making it profitable to get more miners? You are going to sell your bitcoins and buy more miners (or invest in manufacturing miners), which puts downward pressure on the price, until an equilibrium is met with price and mining costs. Therefor I cant see how the price of bitcoin can appreciate substantially enough for a lot of money to enter the ecosystem. It could be 20 years before the price of bitcoin is high enough to make it a legitimate threat against current forms of money/transaction processors

Your time frame for "recent" is very convienent for your argument. I would not consider 2013 to be recent. I could pick arbitrary endpoints as well to paint a different picture.
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:12:46
Miners will always have the option to shut down their mining operations if they become unprofitable. The difficulty in mining will decrease until it becomes profitable again for some miners to continue mining. However it does not work the other way, miners cannot simply turn on additional mining hardware that they dont have, if the price were to increase. 
At the current time, the number of transactions and the resulting fees generated from transactions is neglible. This doesn't really change the miners incentive to mine. In the future when the mining rewards per block are substantially less, either the price of bitcoin will have to be a lot greater, the transaction fees will have to be greater, or the number of transactions will have to increase, or any combination of those three.
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:08:36


Bitcoin is not changing. It is your perception or others people perception that changes. I have full confidence that in 1 years time or 10 years time, the bitcoin protocol will be the same (except for minor changes ie: Blocksize). So if bitcoin essentially doesn't change, how does it become something different than what it is? the only thing that will change is peoples perceptions of it. there may be additional programs or software that make it easier to use, which will change perception as well.
perhaps i worded that wrong "assets that hold their value when equity markets are volatile". What I mean is assets that are not strongly positively correlated with equity markets. So while bitcoin may be volatile on its own right now, it does not necessarily mean that it cant be used as a hedge against stock market fluctuations. The important part being that price of bitcoin changes independently than the price of the stock market.
@_date: 2015-10-12 21:52:18

@_date: 2015-03-24 21:20:59
If bitcoin was to come out tomorrow with the killer app, and everyone want to buy bitcoin, the price would increase to a certain point. At that certain point, you would be indifferent to buying hardware and mine bitcoins or buying bitcoins on the open market. If the supply of hardware cannot keep up with the demand, then people will look to create their own hardware (invest in hardware manufacturing) as opposed to buying more bitcoins. Therefor it would not be rationale for the price of bitcoin to go "to the moon"

If gold becomes worthless tomorrow? If a new digital currency is invented tomorrow? what are you on man? sure there is a possibility of those things happening, but not very likely, and definitely not overnight. 


negative expected value? you are comparing assets to consumer goods to gambling. I dont even know where to begin. Expected value is going to be negative when you are gambling against the house. Expected value will always be positive when investing, or else you would now make that investment. Fine wine is something that people would purchase to consume, so I dont think you would be getting an economic benefit from that

the next halving will either force prices to double, or else hashing power to halve as well, or combination of the two. 
Yeah i cant see the price of bitcoin growing to a higher value until the rewards are diminished, because otherwise everyone would just become miners. But what does this do for the future prospects of bitcoin? how are we supposed to get more money into the bitcoin ecosystem if that money would be more profitable producing or buying mining software? we could be looking at a long period of time before it would even make sense for people with large amounts of money to even look at putting it into bitcoins.

so gold was $1900 an ounce in 2011-2012. it is now just over $1100 per ounce. does gold qualify for your definition of a store of value?
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:10:06
Why does bitcoin need to generate revenue? It is most likely to be used as a store of value similar to gold, silver, and other precious metals. People should diversify their assets. There should be a portion of your portfolio in assets that generate a return (stocks, bonds) and another portion of your portfolio in assets that hold their value when equity markets are volatile. Sometimes people just want to hold something of value so they can use it in the future. You dont want to hold cash because inflation destroys your purchasing power, you want to hold something that is inflation proof and not strongly correlated to the stock market. Bitcoin, gold, and other precious metals fill this need.
