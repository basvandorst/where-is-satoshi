It actually is reasonable. Maybe the part where about it being impossible to download is wrong, it is possible, but also it is possible for me to crawl to the store instead of driving there. The argument is still correct - why go with 1.6TBs per year, when there are much better solutions? Layer 2 solutions are cheap and fast, whereas bCash will not be.

If you want to build a decentralised solution to centralised money problem, it is most definitely impractical.

That's not all you said, if you look just above at the posts, in my very first post in this topic i say it is possible but unreasonable, and you argue about that. 
Now you're trying to say you just argue that it is possible, and it is just not the case. If you don't for some reason believe me telling you this, just scroll above and read the posts.
As for changing the goal posts - again, look at my very first post in this topic, you will see that i consistently argue about the same thing, while you are trying to be all over the place.
As for you being right, well, me saying that i can crawl to the shop is also me being right. But, you see, just because i am right about that, doesn't mean it's reasonable.
As for me saying that you are a shill - well, it is very hard for me to believe you are this retarded. Also i have seen multiple occasions of for example Ver paying people to spread lies, be it on twiter reddit or some other medium. So my conclusion is that you are one of these people.

If you think regular people will give up a quarter of their bandwidth and one 1TB HDD per year for this stupid joke of a coin you are delusional. 
What is more, if somebody ever wants to host a fresh node they will not be able to before buying a ton of HDDs and syncing up for a month. Nodes will be reserved for the few, and this is not what decentralisation is. Stop lying.
EDIT: sorry, it's not a single 1TB HDD per year, its 3 of them per two years, so it's even more
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:38:42
Who said anything about ordinary people?  
I did. I said that the system will become centralised, as ordinary people will not be able to host nodes.
 And you disagreed with me. 
So i provided an explanation why that is true. Now you want to change the subject. The bTrash implementation is a poor solution even for a centralised system, why even argue for it. Clearly the core solution is a way forward, the trash solution is just a 'way', just like me crawling to the shop is a 'way' of getting there. Clearly using a car is better.
Try to read your post again and not laugh about it.
Bottom line is this - if you want to engage with your joke coin, you are very welcome to do that, what do I care.
In fact, if you have some real Bitcoin, i will gladly trade my bTrash for real Bitcoins. I know that you will refuse, because you are just a shill ;)

You're forgetting quantum computing. With quantum computers some day it may be possible to crack SHA256 algorithm. That day is far, and different , QC resistant algorithms are already talked about in bitcoin community.

Well yeah, bigger blocks and more transactions, but segwit also does that, so i see no real benefit of bigger blocks over SegWit. That's why i'm asking for someone to point out some clear pros of bigger blocks and clear cons of SegWit.

Well, with all the various "all time highs" going on in Bitcoin right now, i would say that this IS the bubble, and price should crash soon.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:29:25
Hahaha, ridiculous, do people even fall for this
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:06:56
can someone explain why pools favour the blocksize increase over segwit?
I have created a thread for my question here
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:15:25
cool story bro
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:00:04
Yeah, but as i see it, block size increase offers absolutely nothing, while segwit clearly offers improvement. Today I checked the mining pools' stance on segwit and as I see, quite a few of them favour size increase over SegWit. I just don't see why.
Can someone explain the cons of SegWit and the pros of blocksize increase?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:19:54
Haha, this guy

I don't have any examples (maybe i'm just too lazy to search for them) but what i've noticed is suddenly a lot of people are saying that there must be action taken NOW, which is kind of a stupid thing. If we're creating something, which has the potential to be THE global currency, there's no urgent need for decisions, we can wait and think this trough, think of the consequences etc. There's altcoins for experimenting. 
Another thing i've noticed is radicalisation and dividing of the people - you must pick a side, everything is black and white etc. And i'm not talking about BU and segwit - segwit is pretty good and BU is DEFINITELY not the way to go, but what i see is a lot of low quality content suddenly appears in great quantity with the purpose of dividing everybody. Like Caesar said - divide and conquer.
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:56:24
it's referring to this
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:36:32
Yes, but what i'm saying is that in the recent ~month, maybe two, the shills have greatly increased in number for some reason.
@_date: 2017-04-09 22:23:03


So what? Altcoins still have a LONG way to go till they reach bitcoin




So what? you're saying radicalization is ok, because this is taking too long? It's not even taking that long. But radicalisation is never OK imo.


Well, nobody is holding a gun to my head and forcing me to, but it's paraded all over this sub.

I think you're looking at it in the wrong way. Fact is, anyone can easily go online today and buy enough fent to kill a small city for pretty cheap. Were cryptos not invented, this would not be possible. As a result, a lot of drugs are being cut with fent, and done so in an irresponsible manner, that's why there's so many deaths.

 We must exchange the Dollars name for Cents. So, we will say, -- Yesterday I bought food for a week for 5000 cents. Or, -- Wow today I have spent 850 cents for something worth 8.5 dollars. I am sure it will help a mass adoption a lot.
Federal reserve:
100 cents = 1 dollar
or even better:
100 000 cents = 1000 dollars
Ideally, I think, 100 to 1 (to provide connection between cents and dollars)

I don't see what everyone is so mad about, what Bill said is essentialy true: 10 years ago fentanyl was not shipped worldwide in as large quantities as it is now. Bitcoin had a direct and huge influence on that. Is bitcoin the only factor? No. But you can't ignore the current fent epidemic. Fact is, had cryptocurrencies not been invented, we probably would not have this situation right now.
Don't get me wrong, i LOVE bitcoin, and i think it's the best thing to happen to money. But the truth is the truth, and Bill Gates said it.
