I don't use Segwit yet because the wallet I use -- the Bitcoin Core QT client -- does not fully support it yet. I reckon there are lots of people in the same boat. I'm hoping 0.16 comes soon and with full Segwit support (ie, also at the UI level).

Seriously though, asteroid mining doesn't have to become an overnight contender for gold to lose some of its allure.

I agree.  I propose the word ["thaler"](  The thaler (or taler) was a silver coin used throughout Europe for many centuries (the word "dollar" itself derives from it).  It has the advantage of a) sounding distinguished, b) not being in common usage and therefore unlikely to cause confusion, and c) being short and easy to pronounce (particularly if we adopt the spelling/pronunciation "taler").

I agree that the Chinese obsession of saving-face is a bit silly, but it's deeply ingrained into their culture and you're not going to change that.
Note that there's no reason why Core needs to compromise on anything fundamental to the decentralised nature of Bitcoin. Core developers themselves have manifested openness to an eventual increase in the maximum block size.
So why not agree to the hard-fork soon -- say Jan 1st 2018 -- but with the understanding that there will be a slow ramp up in block size. We can start with 1.1MB blocks, followed a few months later with 1.2MB blocks, and so on until 2MB are reached a couple of years later.
Note that in this scenario there is still a single hard-fork event, but allows everyone to save face and claim victory.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:28:08
My point is that besides all the general awesomeness around Bitcoin, it is very likely that it will also replace gold as the epitome of scarcity!
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:20:43
I applaud this effort. Contrary to the feeling of many people on this thread, I think there is room for compromise. The only reason we haven't seen one yet is because people are not taking into account the importance of finding a solution that allows every party to save face.
I've made my own proposal in a [recent thread]( that sadly didn't get promoted to the front page of @_date: 2014-05-22 10:28:19
Gold is a noble metal, meaning it does not rust (even silver tarnishes when exposed to air).  That alone means it has plenty of practical applications!
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:24:27
Great post, thanks! I agree that on purely technical terms, Bitcoin would probably be fine with Segwit alone and without a hard fork. **However**, the real world does not care about purely technical terms, and the human factor must be taken into account.
Resolving this impasse requires a compromise that allows all parties to save face. Moreover, I think that compromise is well within reach. What would you say to a hard-fork commitment on the part of Core for 2MB blocks, but one which **slowly** ramps up the maximum block size?
To be more precise: the hard-fork activates on Jan 1st 2018 with 1.1MB. Then every two months or so the maximum block size increases by 0.1MB until it reaches 2MB.
Note that there's still only **one** hard-fork event, which fully commits the network to eventually accept 2MB blocks.  However, since there's a slow ramp-up in block size, there's time to fix any potential issues raised by the larger block sizes. Moreover, since it will take nearly two years to reach the full 2MB blocks, there's two more years for storage and bandwidth prices to go down and therefore reduce the risk of centralisation.
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:58:15
Don't forget a mediator. When I hear interviews with the different parties involved in this conflict, they seem like reasonable people.  They might, however, be "geeks" in the sense they don't have the best people skills in person or in electronic communication, and this may be hindering a compromise. A professional mediator would help in this case.
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:24:14


Those claims are ridiculous, which is why I didn't make them!
Seriously, I only stated that gold would become much more abundant than it is today, not that it would become as abundant as iron or aluminium.  The story of aluminium is only a cautionary tale that when it comes to physical goods, past scarcity is not an indicator of future scarcity.
As for asteroid mining, even if gold is evenly distributed in an asteroid at fairly low concentrations, it would still be at a far higher concentration than what it's found on the Earth's crust. Remember that most of gold present when the Earth was formed sank to the core, and most of the gold we find on the crust was actually brought in by asteroids during the Late Heavy Bombardment period.  I think the concentration in many asteroids will be high enough to make mining feasible.
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:33:32
I think gold will eventually be much cheaper than silver is today.  People underestimate the utterly insane amount of heavier metals easily accessible in asteroids, and overestimate the amount of gold that has ever been mined on Earth.  It may take a while, but once economies of scale start kicking in with asteroid mining, we will see lots of noble metals (platinum, palladium, gold, etc) become far cheaper and common.
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:30:13
I agree with your goal of decentralization, but the way you frame it is not helpful. Though I'm also a small-blocker, I think a [compromise hard-fork solution]( that gets us incrementally to 2MB blocks would not hurt decentralisation, and may in fact even help making Bitcoin more decentralised! (Compromise -&gt; healthier community -&gt; more confidence -&gt; more adoption -&gt; more nodes)
You have to bear in mind that not all parties aiming for larger block sizes are irrational dimwits that don't understand the dangers of centralisation.
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:46:42
Who are these people that you talk about? I'm sure you consider yourself to be a person that understands nuance and doesn't see the world in black and white. Nearly all Bitcoiners I know value a **combination** of different properties of Bitcoin. The differences of opinion arise from the different **weights** they assign to different properties of Bitcoin.
Why is this important in this discussion? Because it allows a path forward. Finding a compromise is possible when you realise that a solution that all reasonable parties can agree to does not actually require a paradigm shift in the way people view Bitcoin, but instead just a slight tweak to the weights they give each property.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:33:35


That is the wrong attitude if you're really looking for a resolution to the dispute. At the end of the day you have to look in the mirror and ask yourself what is more important: activating SegWit, or winning imaginary Internet points by using strong proud language that leaves no room for compromise?
@_date: 2016-03-03 18:15:31
Yes, I agree that seeing empty blocks is a bummer when most others are nearly full.  However, how would one stop it in practice?  I guess extra rules could be made (say, a block is accepted only if its size is at least a certain percentage of the average of the past N blocks), but I feel these rules may not be consensual and/or have failure cases which may not be obvious.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:45:23
I don't believe there's any Blockstream conspiracy, but that doesn't mean the core devs can simply choose inaction as an option.  I reckon the best way forward is for a consensus that makes everyone save face.
Suppose that Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic would agree to set the 2MB block hard fork date (pending approval of 80% of mining power) to the 1st January of 2017.  This is well within Core's concerns of having plenty of lead time before the HF, and fits nicely into their roadmap.  But at the same time, Classic proponents could claim their protest was instrumental in hastening the arrival of 2MB blocks.  Everybody claims victory, nobody loses face, and Bitcoin comes out in a much better shape.
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:42:45
Kudos for organizing the Satoshi Roundtable.  I think these regular face-to-face meetings away from cameras and microphones are a very positive thing.


Yes, I agree that's a problem.  However, I don't think it's necessarily a fatal one in the mediated solution.  If we were to take a step back and look at the situation, most parties already agree on the basics, and the argument is mostly about the calendar.  A good mediator -- even if not well versed in the technical aspects -- can make both parties see that it's in their best interest to reach some sort of compromise where everybody saves face.
Core wants the 2MB HF in July 2017.  Classic wants it ASAP.  Suppose a compromise date of January 1st 2017 were reached?  Everybody could say their voice was heard and no one would lose face.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:57:27
I agree that the sky is not falling **now**.  But as an engineer, I would very much prefer to have plenty of breathing room in terms of network capacity to accommodate sudden surges.  Segregated Witness is great and should buy us some time.  However, I would very much prefer to have the 2MB hard fork sooner than July 2017.  I've suggested the 1st of January of 2017 in a different comment: it fits into Core's roadmap and allows both sides to save face.
By the way, note that 2MB blocks **today** are cheaper in terms of bandwidth and storage costs than 1MB blocks were 8 years ago. Therefore, while I agree that we cannot keep increasing block size forever, I reckon that SW+2MB blocks as soon as possible give us enough breathing room until better scaling solutions are available. (LN? Side-chains?)
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:05:38
Yeap, I agree.  Moreover, I've already stated in a different comment in this thread that both parties are not that far apart in technical terms.  I've suggested a compromise solution that sets the HF date for the 1st of January of 2017.  This fits well into Core's roadmap, while at the same time allowing the Classic camp to claim they've got an early HF.  Both sides save face and everyone wins.
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:13:03


I do care about their perception.  Ill-informed people vote on the ballot box and with their money.  While I agree that we shouldn't necessarily cater to their whims, we ignore their perceptions and actions at our own peril.


What if the two are intertwined? It's by no means guaranteed that Bitcoin will be the winner in the crypto-currency space.  Ethereum may be in a bubble, but its surge and Bitcoin woes could make VC money choose it over Bitcoin.  The result would be a stronger Ethereum ecosystem and a weaker Bitcoin one a couple of years down the line...

It would matter **a lot**. If and were to reach some sort of face-saving compromise, many other parties would join.  And mind you, you don't need **everyone's** agreement. What you do need for starters is a compromise that includes an undisputed majority. Once you get there, plenty of people on the fence will join the bandwagon.  There's even a chance you may reach the 95% threshold.

If you go through my submission history I think you'll find someone who's generally on the Core side on technical matters, but who has also made repeated appeals to some sort of dialogue between the various parties, and perhaps even (gasp!) a compromise.

If he is indeed making an offer to negotiate, Core should graciously accept.  Given the recent BU bug, Core would go into a negotiation from a position of strength. Moreover, if Core refuses to negotiate they will come across as being immature and unreasonable regardless of the technical merits of their position. Do not underestimate the number of people who are just sick and tired of this conflict!
Also, if a negotiation does begin, please don't mess it up by ignoring all the basic rules of "Negotiations 101".  I've [described in great length]( how such a negotiation should proceed, and I hope the adults in the room realise at least that a successful negotiation depends a great deal on protocol.

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:59:13
I agree that there's a good chance that BU may end up the winner, which is unfortunate because I'm pretty sure Bitcoin will end up way more centralized if BU wins. But there's some irony in here: the no-compromise crowd may end living a crypto-currency world that is very centralized, only because they were unwilling to accept a small block size increase that posed a small risk of slight centralization...
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:34:09
Bitcoin needs to be a community with a well defined governance model.  Without it, you repeat the same mistake that anarchic communities always make: by not making governance explicit, you end up having ad-hoc implicit governance (usually by the loudest voice or the one with the biggest gun) which is a lot less democratic and sustainable.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:08:54
I don't think I'm missing the point. I agree with you that there's always a risk associated with a hard fork, even if it's non-contentious and planned well in advance. However, I reckon that the current rift in the community poses a much higher risk. Note that if BU goes ahead with their plan, there's a very real risk of a contentious hard fork. It's precisely because hard forks are so risky that we should prefer one which is non-contentious and well-planned in advance!

Depending on the schedule, it can be less than one year (raise by 0.1MB every month), or several years (raise every quarter, for instance).  What matters is that once the hard fork event is triggered, there will be a firm commitment to eventually reach 2MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:35:44
The problem is that a Segwit-only solution does not allow Chinese miners to save face. I don't really get why people are having so much trouble understanding this: a great deal of the resistance to Segwit has nothing to do with its technical merits. We need a compromise that allows all parties to save face!
Also, surely you agree that the risk of centralisation can be greatly mitigated if the block size increase happens gradually, no? There will still be a single hard-fork event, but there's no reason why the increase to 2MB must happen in a single go.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:24:21
It's funny that this is being seriously proposed here. If you propose some sort of compromise that may result in a modest increase in block size (say to 2MB) you get downvoted into oblivion and people argue that any hard-fork is too dangerous to even consider. But propose a hostile hard-fork just to screw the other side and it gets cheered on. I honestly don't know what to think anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:09:09
Certainly not Roger Ver. And neither Luke Jr on the Core side, for that matter. Obviously the individuals doing the actual negotiation should be mature adults. Anyone who has paid attention to Roger Ver can tell there's something off about him...

If you're into conspiracy theories it may be impossible to have any sort of civilised conversation with you. Regardless, I mentioned Gavin because he's always come across as being reasonable and polite in his interviews. But perhaps you have a better idea of who should represent BU?
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:02:13
That's also an option.  The advantage of mediation is that purely on the technical terms both sides are not that far apart from each other.  I feel like personal animosity and bad communication are major obstacles to consensus, and a good mediator can make both parties reach an agreement where everybody saves face.
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:51:08
I reckon that if push came to shove, 3 months would be enough to pull a safe HF as long as there was enough publicity about it.  And I'm sure that the 2MB HF will have **plenty** of publicity...
Nevertheless, I agree with you that a longer period may be desirable just to be even more on the safe side.  Perhaps Core should start committing **right now** to a concrete date (whatever that may be).  I'm partial to the 1st of January of 2017, but even if they choose the 1st of July 2017, it would be nice to get that firm commitment ASAP.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:43:50


If that's your general attitude, I suspect life has many rude awakenings coming your way.


Spoken like a true non-programmer. The intersection between programming and the real world is not empty. Therefore, programmers have to make ugly compromises with the crazy aspects of reality **all the time** (I know, I do it for a living).
Bitcoin is a system developed by humans for humans, and as such cannot be oblivious to the less than rational aspects of human nature. In this particular debate, the optimal solution is one that takes into account not only technical aspects but also sociological ones.
Making a tantrum because the world is not the way it should be gets us nowhere.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:34:41
I never tried to hide the fact that I lean towards Core's position on technical matters. They have the most capable development team, and have proved that time and again. However, I'm also in favour of some sort of compromise, and there's no contradiction in that.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:13:18
I've made a [similar proposal]( Basically, there's no reason why the 2MB hard fork cannot happen incrementally, with 0.1MB steps. There would still be a single hard fork event, but the ramp up is slow enough to give the network time to adapt.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:48:58
The representatives should be mature adults acting in good faith. I feel that if I suggest any names I'll be crucified one way or the other, but on the Core side I always found Adam Back to be polite and reasonable in his interviews. On the BU side, I reckon Gavin Andresen is still the best bet for a civilised discussion.
There are also some people I would **not** pick for any negotiation. On the Core side, Luke Jr comes to mind. I appreciate his technical contributions, but in his Reddit history he comes across as unhinged and divorced from reality. On the BU side, I would not pick Roger Ver. There's something off about him, and he doesn't strike me as a mature individual.

You're looking purely at the technical aspect and forgetting the human one.  Many Chinese miners feel that accepting this solution without also a 2MB hard-fork will cause them to lose face. Don't underestimate the importance of face-saving in Chinese culture!
What we need is a compromise that allows all parties to save face. I'm a small-blocker, but I would be fine with a hard-fork that slowly ramps up the maximum block size to 2MB. This allows those Chinese miners to save face, even if the ramp up is so slow that it takes us a couple of years to reach those 2MB blocks...
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:07:31

@_date: 2017-03-17 15:31:32
I think it's clear from reading the [open letter]( that I tend to agree with Core on the technical matters.


That's the sort of "slippery-slope argument" that I cautioned against!


It won't be a waste of time. All that Core needs to do to convince a lot of people that they are indeed acting in good faith is to make a statement saying they are open to a dialogue with a representative from BU.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:14:36
See for instance [this comment]( I've posted on today's [thread about Jihan Wu's supposed offer to negotiate]( I can see the comment, but other logged in users can't. Does it come across as something so beyond the pale that it must be hidden? Or is this the result of some weird Reddit bug?
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:01:03
My position is the same as it has always been. I think that Bitcoin would probably be fine with 1MB blocks.  However, there may be people who have legitimate reasons for increasing the block size, and I think we should consider their wishes seriously. Moreover, many Core developers have already expressed their support for an eventual block size increase. Therefore, why not make a concrete proposal that slowly increases the block size to 2MB? Together with Segwit, this would effectively give us 4MB blocks, which should buy us plenty of time for 2nd layer solutions to mature. If you want the full details, please read [the full proposal](
If you've really gone through my Reddit history I honestly can't understand how you can possibly infer that I'm some sort of "closet HF cheerleader". Do you have reading comprehension problems? Or does the concept of nuance escape you completely?
@_date: 2016-03-06 14:16:29
While I don't agree with his actions pertaining to the Classic fork, I don't think Gavin Andresen is an unreasonable or uncompromising person.  I think that if Core were to reach an agreement with him where everybody saved face, the strident voices on r/btc would see their audience greatly reduced.
@_date: 2017-02-03 10:22:36
This. What we need is a compromise that allows all parties to save face. I think many actors in the Bitcoin community don't realise how important is face-saving in Chinese culture, for instance.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:15:25
Agreed. The feeling I get when reading the comments on is that many technical people are completely oblivious to the political and sociological aspects that end up determining who wins.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:26:27
Reality check: we are not in a reasonable world.
While I'm 100% behind Core on the technical merits, I also recognise that they badly handled the sociological aspects of this debate. The result was that many Chinese miners feel they would lose face if they were to accept SegWit without also a 2MB hard fork.
Now, this "saving face" thing may seem just like a silly aspect of Chinese culture, but it's extremely important for them. It's unfortunate that we should be mixing non-technical aspects on an argument which should have been purely technical, but the damage is already done. The only way forward now is to find a solution that allows everyone to claim some sort of victory. [And I reckon one is possible](
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:32:55
What matters is the main chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:06:04
Also, a word of caution to the no-compromise-ever crowd: if no compromise is reached, there's a good chance there will be a split, and it's possible that a majority of the hash power and the ecosystem will migrate to BU. In other words, BU may end up being the "winner". This would be unfortunate for many reasons, foremost because BU is likely to result in a highly centralized coin indirectly controlled by the Chinese government.
Think about this: you may end up living in a world where the dominant crypto-currency is highly centralized, all because you were unwilling to consider a face-saving compromise that resulted in slightly larger blocks and only a modest risk of slightly higher centralization!

It is for me an endless source of frustration how the brilliant technical people in the Bitcoin space seem to be so inept at the basics of communication, building consensus, and negotiating through technical arguments. I don't expect them to be experts in soft skills, but some of the blunders made during this conflict just beggar belief.


Indeed. I reckon that Satoshi's biggest failing was leaving the project without a clear governance model in place. It would have been much easier back then establish a model that takes into account the interests of miners, developers, users, and stake holders.


Yeap. I know of at least one project -- [Tezos]( -- that aims to build a blockchain where the mechanism for consensus is baked in. Though I confess I haven't really looked all that much into it.

210,000 is still a large stash for a single individual.  Also, instead of the redistribution, i would simply burn those coins: same effect, but much  simpler!

You misread my post.  I did not equate "old nodes" with "0.8.x" only.  In fact, my complaint about old nodes was specifically about versions earlier than the 0.11.x series, which is a non-trivial percentage of the network, as your link can attest to.
@_date: 2016-06-19 16:00:43
I would keep 100,000 and publicly burn 900,000 (send to unspendable address).  This would make all existing Bitcoin more valuable, remove uncertainty from the market, and allow me to keep a very healthy stash, growing in value.

But why leave the client running?  It's consuming bandwidth, so there must be a cost to the maintainer.  While I'm glad they are helping the network by running a full node, they could help it even more at minimal hassle simply by upgrading!

Given enough warning and consensus, a hardfork can be reasonably be called "safe".  Suppose 99.9% of the hashing power would agree to fork. After the fork, the minority chain would have only 0.1% of the hashing power and consequently the interval between blocks would be a whole freaking week! Don't you think this would be safe?

The crazies will never be happy, but those aren't the ones you should be worrying about. The ones that matter are those who honestly think that large blocks will be good for Bitcoin, and find some of the arguments you use just unconvincing. Bear in mind that among the unconvinced are plenty of Chinese miners who have the power to block the adoption of Segwit.  Therefore, either you do a pretty good job of convincing them, or you propose a compromise solution that allows everyone to save face. A hardfork to 2MB blocks may be just that compromise.
Mind you, I agree that any increase in block size risks increased centralization, and that's a big disadvantage of 2MB blocks. However, I'm not convinced it's a fatal flaw.
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:59:52
To paraphrase Einstein, who supposedly said about physical theories that "they should be as simple as possible, but not simpler", my position on the block size debate is that blocks should be as small as possible, but not smaller.
I guess that technically places me into the small block camp.  However, I can see the merit in a modest increase to 2MB blocks, for a couple of reasons:
 * It may be a while before 2nd layer solutions become mature. Immediate adoption of Segwit plus a hardfork to 2MB blocks mid 2017 would give us an effective block size of 4-8MB (according to estimates by Core developers, who predict that Segwit alone would give us 2-4MB).  This should give us plenty of breathing room to accommodate growth while keeping fees low at or below 10 cents.  Low fees are essential for the short term growth of Bitcoin.
 * A compromise solution would extend an olive branch to large blockers, and would allow all honest parties to save face.  This is particularly important because many Chinese miners are refusing to adopt Segwit without some sort of compromise on the block size.
I've laid out [the case for compromise]( at great length in a recent post.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:52:05
I don't think all large block proponents are acting in bad faith or out of ignorance.  There are sufficient unknowns that preclude one from categorical stating that block size X is the correct choice.
I tend to believe that 1MB blocks are probably fine, but I also don't see the sky falling with 2MB blocks.  If a 2MB compromise sends an olive branch to the honest parties on the other side of the divide, and allows them to save face, then I say we should do it.
(Also, I don't think an independent observer would judge my comments and yours and judge you to be in a higher grade...)
@_date: 2016-12-03 19:57:18
Segwit does not allow them to save face, though! For many large-blockers, this is mostly an emotional rather than technical issue.  Now you may be wondering: "why should we cater to such irrational people?".  Normally you wouldn't, but you have to bear in mind that a) not all large blockers are irrational (they merely assess the danger of centralization differently), b) some of them are Chinese miners who may block the adoption of Segwit. With all this in mind, I think Core developers (who I trust the most on technical matters, btw) must start considering a plan B that will allow everyone to save face.
A compromise hardfork to 2MB may end up being the "least worst" of all options, particularly if some of the downsides are mitigated by careful timing.
As I explained in point 7, the increase does not need to happen all at once.  Suppose that once the hardfork is triggered, blocks increase to only 1.1MB, which is followed a month later by 1.2MB, and so forth until 2MB are reached. Mind you, there is still only one hardfork event, but the increase to 2MB can ramp up slowly over almost one entire year.  And over that time, storage costs and bandwidth will have gone down a bit, which means that centralization won't be as drastic as if you had a sudden burst to 2MB.
Anyway, this is just an example.  I think the first step is to recognise that not all people on the other side of the barricade are crazy or malicious, and that a compromise that allows **all honest parties** to save face is desirable.
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:47:29
But are there really any technical reasons why the network may work fine with 1MB blocks but fail with 2MB blocks?  (Note that I'm assuming that the hardfork to 2MB blocks will only happen after Segwit, which fixes some of the quadratic issues with the verification of some transactions.)
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:03:00
I agree, which is why I specifically said that the consensus would have to include miners, developers, and all major Bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:02:25


I agree that some are indeed acting in bad faith.  But not all, and we must give the latter a face-saving solution.  This is what being magnanimous means.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:06:28
I don't think anything will persuade those acting in bad faith.  There are however people who are emotionally committed to large blocks and a compromise will give them a way out without losing face. (I think Westerners tend to underestimate just how incredibly important it is in other cultures to save face.)
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:12:39
You can never disentangle politics from any scenario where two or more humans are involved!
If you try to ignore politics you end up in a situation like we have today, with Bitcoin in a stalemate regarding its future.
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:53:43
Yeah, I'm not opposed to using the word "balance".  But why do you think "compromise" is wrong? (English is not my first language)
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:03:06
Bitcoin is still in its infancy.  Think longer term.
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:26:51
1. There's a cabal of miners who won't support Segwit unless large blocks are also on the table.  A 2MB compromise (neither small nor large) allows everyone to save face.
2. It may be a long time before 2nd layer solutions are mature. Segwit gives us approx 2MB now, and the hardfork in a half a year would again double this amount.  This gives Bitcoin plenty of breathing room to accommodate growth without raising fees.
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:00:09
You may be underestimating how important saving face is in some cultures, notably among the Chinese. Do I need to spell out the consequences of ignoring this aspect?
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:41:22
Bitcoin involves two or more humans. Therefore Bitcoin is susceptible to politics, of course!  Can you name one activity where humans are involved which is not susceptible to politics?
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:37:17
I'm particularly interested in knowing how it compares to UASF in terms of overall security.  It seems to me the original 95% threshold was chosen mostly for political reasons, as it presupposed an overwhelming support for Segwit. Since that ship has sailed, I reckon a much lower threshold would still be backed by the economic majority, right?
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:08:36
But were they scammed in the technical sense of the word? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that they bought a product which did deliver the X PH/s as advertised.  The thing about the covert ASICboost is that the hardware was actually capable of much better performance than advertised, but with a special firmware/software which was only available to Jihan's enterprises, right?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:20:23
True, but nothing like a spectacular crash of B2X right after the fork to encourage miners to mine preferentially on the original chain.

Core doesn't have to accept the letter of the code of Segwit2x. What if Core were to propose a compromise that sees Segwit activated immediately in exchange for a hard-fork far in the future (say, in 1 year), with a slow ramp up to 2MB blocks after the hard-fork?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:11:22
It's true that Segwit fixes covert ASICboost. But that's missing the point the OP is making: because Segwit does a lot of other things beyond fixing ASICboost, a dishonest miner can muddle the waters and claim they oppose Segwit for a bunch of bogus reasons, when in reality the true reason they oppose Segwit is ASICboost.
This is why we need a preliminary soft-fork that kills covert ASICboost **and does nothing else**. That way dishonest miners won't be able to hide anymore! Please check out [this other thread]( for a more detailed case.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:03:32
Then please do your best to convince your fellow Core developers also sitting on the fence to put their unequivocal support behind BIP148. If within the next couple of weeks more and more notable figures in the Bitcoin community come out in support of BIP148, then I reckon the momentum will be unstoppable.
You seem really sure BIP148 will succeed, and I'd love for that to be true. But I have nowhere near the level of confidence you have, and I'd like to see more Core developers actively fighting for BIP148 before I change my mind.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:52:12
The beauty of a soft-fork which kills ASICboost is that if it gets rejected by Jihan &amp; Co, then their shenanigans will have been exposed in the clearest possible way. Should that happen, the support for a UASF would rise dramatically (I suspect even Core developers would jump on board).
I'm 100% convinced that unless Jihan &amp; Co change their minds about Segwit very soon, the best strategy for Core is really to propose this ASICboost killing soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:56:39
I think there's another strategy for getting SW even if the upcoming UASF fails. Core could propose a [soft-fork that kills ASICboost]( and does nothing else. Since it's very likely that miner opposition to SW is rooted in ASICboost, this move would expose their shenanigans, which would tremendously increase support for a subsequent UASF.
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:58:35
Mind you, I do agree with you that the most likely explanation for Jihan &amp; Co actions is that they are using ASICboost covertly, and all the FUD they raise about Segwit is nothing but a smoke screen.
As for the position of it is my understanding that he's the only notable Core developer who is vocally in favour of BIP148, right? Surely Luke must realise that the case for a UASF would be much stronger if there was no doubt whatsoever that miner opposition to Segwit is due to ASICboost and that many miners have been acting in bad faith.
As things stand, I have doubts the UASF will succeed. However, I'm pretty sure the UASF would gather an unambiguous majority of support (even from other Core developers) if it could be shown that miners have been dishonest.
Therefore, as a purely tactical matter it makes sense for Luke to support a soft-fork that kills ASICboost. I realise it may be too late for BIP148, but we need a fallback strategy in case BIP148 fails.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:00:33
Funny, the answers this thread generated reinforced my original point: the possibility of ASICboost only brings confusion to the scaling debate, and therefore the path towards resolving that debate must pass by making ASICboost impossible.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:41:29
We should call out his bluff!
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:56:16
Paging and as I'd really like to hear their opinion on this strategy.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:00:24
Framing the situation like that implies there's only two options, which is short-sighted IMHO.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:56:51


But If that's really the case, shouldn't all miners actually welcome an ASICboost-killing soft-fork, since it would remove all doubts that their opposition to Segwit is in no way motivated by ASICboost?


How could Bitcoin profit from it? If all the miners were to use ASICboost, the playing field would be level, which is no different than the situation where no miners could use ASICboost.


Of course, but in a business with very tight margins, even the slight advantage afforded by ASICboost translates into very high profits, much higher than the profits you would get on a level playing field even if Bitcoin were 10x the price.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:14:09
Suppose that is indeed the case. Shouldn't the miners that oppose Segwit be on the frontlines clamouring for a soft-fork that kills ASICboost, because that will put to rest any suspicion about their true motives for opposing Segwit?
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:08:25
Thanks for your reply &gt; Even if it fails, I will be supporting the BIP148 chain as an altcoin while Bitcoin dies of stagnation.
I empathise with the frustration your feeling. Segwit as a SF is a brilliant hack, and it's a shame it's being held back by the Jihan cartel. **However**, I urge you reconsider the strategy around BIP148, particularly if it fails. I realise I'm probably not the first person trying to convince you on this issue, but please bear with me regardless.
Bitcoin moves by consensus, and optics matter a lot in forming that consensus. While for you and me it's quite obvious that the Jihan cartel is not acting in good faith, there are plenty of honest actors in the Bitcoin ecosystem for whom this is not yet obvious. It doesn't mean they're dumb. There's been enough misinformation and miscommunication to make it difficult to tell.
The success of a UASF hinges on convincing those on the fence. Therefore, as a matter of strategy you should be doing all it takes to make it absolutely clear that a) the Jihan cartel is not acting in good faith, and b) you've always taken the high road, and c) all avenues for compromise have been closed by the Jihan cartel.
There are only positive outcomes from an ASICboost-killing soft-fork:
 1. If the Jihan cartel rejects it, their malfeasance for the past year will have been exposed, and support for UASF would become much stronger.
 2. If the Jihan cartel accepts it, I can guarantee you that soon after they will suddenly find themselves much more receptive to Segwit. Obviously for face-saving purposes they'll claim they changed their mind because Litecoin showed that Segwit is safe or whatever. The justification won't matter, what matters is that Segwit will have been activated.
Therefore, even if an ASICboost-killing soft-fork requires postponing BIP148, it makes all strategic sense to do it first!
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:36:59
Good to hear. Note, however, that Greg Maxwell still categorises the BIP148 proposal as "deficient" due to perceived lack of broad community support. What would definitely put me over the fence is vocal support for BIP148 from many Core developers...
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:02:07
Which is why Core should take the initiative and propose a soft-fork that kills ASICboost. Give dishonest miners no place to hide.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:06:43
Did you even read the post? I think you'll find my reasons for being on the fence are mostly about caution and strategy, not because I disagree that Bitmain is very likely acting maliciously.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:49:54
But that's the crux of my point: if Jihan's true motive for opposing Segwit has nothing to do with ASICboost, then they should be advocating for a soft-fork which only kills ASICboost. That way, the community could actually seriously debate their arguments against Segwit without the present shadow that their stated motives are not their true motives...
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:09:03
But is it faulty beyond repair or is Greg trying to come up with a fix?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:16:34
One more thought: to make sure miners don't find subterfuges to oppose a ASICboost-killing fork, it should be a Miner Activated Soft Fork, of course.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:05:40
Agreed. Make ASICboost impossible and I bet the scaling debate will become much clearer. I've laid out my argument in greater detail [on another thread]( that is now sitting in the queue.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:03:24
I very much doubt both Bitcoin and Litecoin can succeed.  They are just too similar.  It's like any ecosystem: you never find two species occupying the same niche.

@_date: 2013-03-21 23:37:39

@_date: 2017-06-13 11:58:12
You keep side-stepping the crux of the argument: if Jihan is being honest about having a different vision for Bitcoin, then why isn't he signaling that to the community by removing all doubt about his true intentions?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:16:14
You're missing the point the OP is making. It's true that Segwit fixes covert ASICboost. However, because Segwit does a lot of other things beyond fixing ASICboost, a dishonest miner can muddle the waters and claim they oppose Segwit for a bunch of bogus reasons, when in reality the true reason they oppose Segwit is ASICboost.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:57:57
But suppose ASICboost was used by everyone. How would that be an improvement over the situation where no one was using it?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:35:14
I still hope some sort of compromise can be hammered out. Segwit2MB is actually not far off from the position advocated by many Core developers. I reckon they would accept it if some of its technical shortcomings were fixed, the hard-fork date were put farther in the future (say 1 year after Segwit activation), and if it featured a slow ramp up to 2MB after the hard-fork event instead of block size going from 1MB to 2MB in a single go.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:46:25
hasn't been very active on Reddit, because otherwise it would be cool if he could chime in... ;-)
But anyway, even if ASICboost is not being actively used, the mere possibility only adds suspicion and confusion to the scaling debate. It strikes me as obvious that everyone should be actively trying to make it go away.
Now, I realise that has expressed the opinion that a soft-fork addressing only ASICboost is unnecessary because Segwit already kills ASICboost. I find this very naive, because a dishonest miner is able to camouflage their true motives behind a bunch of Segwit-related FUD.
@_date: 2013-03-13 16:55:55
The thing is, Litecoin differs so little from Bitcoin that if something were to happen to Bitcoin it would almost certainly also happen to Litecoin!
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:56:17
But here's the thing: suppose that Jihan &amp; Co are being honest about their opposition to Segwit being rooted in a different vision for what Bitcoin should be. Then why aren't they proposing a soft-fork which kills ASICboost? Surely they must realise that while the shadow of ASICboost looms over the scaling discussion, people will find it hard to believe their honest motives.
Seriously, put yourself in the shoes of an honest miner who is not using ASICboost and opposes Segwit for purely "vision" reasons. You only have to gain from a soft-fork which kills ASICboost. So why aren't you clamouring for it?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:12:12


No, the page you linked to shows that less than one third of Core devs prefer BIP148. That's not a majority. Moreover, about half of Core devs either outright reject BIP148 or find it wanting/deficient.
If you're trying to convince me by using that page as a source you're not being very effective...
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:14:45


True. But Segwit does a lot besides preventing covert ASICboost, which allows dishonest miners to hide their true motives by spreading FUD about Segwit. Which is why if you want to uncover their bullshit you need a soft-fork that kills ASICboost and does nothing else. Leave Bitmain no place to hide!
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:02:26
Except that Litecoin is so similar to Bitcoin that any attack against BTC will also succeed against LTC.  People are deluding themselves if they think that Bitcoin-clones like LTC bring enough diversity to the ecosystem.
What we do need are alternative crypto-currencies based on different concepts, economics, and implementations.
@_date: 2013-03-13 17:00:00
I have no beef against Ripple.  It is a fundamentally different concept for a very different purpose.  It's all the Bitcoin-clones that I find misguided.

I agree that in general diversity is good for any ecosystem.  However, Litecoin and other clones are almost identical to Bitcoin.  If some serious bug were to be discovered in Bitcoin it would almost certainly also affect them all!  This is why I would prefer if these alternative coins brought fundamental novelties to the table instead of being "me too" currencies.
