I believe that the main goal is to be able to check a wallet before making any transaction with unfamilier person ...
Today, you have this fraud check functionality in credit cards companies via realtime API, I believe the goal here is the same.

I really don't understand your comment.
Instead of sending/receiving coins from fraud wallets you could just validate them.
What's wrong with that?!? Why not?!
What a better solution do you have? Keep whining in reddit that you were scammed and write a comment about it? Why not use the power of all against this shit?

It's exactly like the spamming mechanism, there's no one big truth but wisdom of crowds.
Moreover, it's just a helper tool which gives more insights, you can use it and you can ignore it, your choice. 
It's always better to get red lights before critical operations - even if you decide to ignore them.

educating is good. enforcing is better.
if a wallet account is marked as fraud, no transactions should be limited to it. that's it.
you're approach of all or nothing is terrible IMO, 
and regarding your 'non-educated' open source claim... even isoteric operating system as Linux is open sourced and i don't think it got much security vulnerabilities... the fact that something is opensourced doesn't mean anything regarding security elements, moreover, these projects tend to be super secured because of their nature.
