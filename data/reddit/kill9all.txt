What does W3C have to do with central bankers?
My point was that central bankers are used to using currencies that inflate to meet their economic goals as such they would be a poor choice to lead the bitcoin foundation for example. Someone who knows the principals of Austrian economics or deflationary currencies would be better suited to lead a community org like e bitcoin foundation.
btw W3C is a great example of an established community standard you make a great point but its out of context with the central bankers part of your first post I was trying to refute.

I think the biggest thing is your reputation as a developer. If you make an app that is open source and nobody has problems reported security flaws then you will earn a little trust from the users. Thats not really a great solution though,
The problem here is the app store distribution model which means the user cannot take your open source code and compile the app on their device. That is usually how you know that the software you are using is the exact copy of the open source code and nothing has been changed.

BFL initially planned to be producing at full capacity in 3 months from the release date in Sept 2012.
If that was an accurate statement then we should be at full production now given boards were finalized in early June and their initial timeline only gave them a month or so to ramp up production. So where is the production??
Does it take a full 3 months to ramp up production? That means they were lying from the very beginning.

Ok, Ill agree that they have different market exposures which could be considered diversification. 


Its based off Bitcoin, the tech is virtually the same, they just increases the confirmation times, and the number of coins. If for example the Bitcoin fork proved to be a major issue for Bitcoin it would likely affect Litecoin too which would result in the same or a worse result than for Bitcoin since the development community for Litecoin is so small comparatively.

Interesting take, I don't really look at bitcoin as an investment but more as a way to preserve wealth. 
Lets face it the dollar inflates every year wether its the reported 1 to 2% or the theorized higher percentage if your investment doesn't make more than 7% a year you will only be making ~5%. 
I see bitcoin as a way to at a minimum avoid the 2% inflation and hopefully you just gain more than 3% per year. If it does that year on year it will still be a good place to have had my wealth stored. 
Honestly the stock market feels more risky than bitcoin and your doing really good with a consistent 7% gain. I think bitcoin can beat it but if I just don't lose money due to inflation Ill be happy.

Im in agreement with you, look at the stock market for the most part the transaction fees are flat rate x dollars per trade. No matter how big or small, it prevents people from making needless .001 BTC trades since the cost would be most of the trade. Doing a flat percentage encourages bot trading to take place which results in overloading a already at capacity server. There should be flat transaction fees.

I would argue that by protecting them we allow them to get dumber which in turn leads to more protections needing to be set up, and the cycle continues.


Those are all done through contracts, read the terms, if you disagree or don't understand them then don't sign the contract. If people had just read the mortgages they got back in the pre 2008 years we wouldn't have had as large of a housing crisis.

Why would anyone want one exchange to just transfer their accounts to coin lab?
If I signed up for a mtgox account and so far my experience has been good with them. Wire transfers show up in a day, I have been able to make trades easily, and I have been able to withdraw it to and offline wallet regularly and without issues. Why would I want to lose my mtgox account and have it sent to coin lab?
I have never used them before, I don't trust them, they will be subjected to US regulations which means all their assets could be seized at anytime. As a US citizen I would prefer to use mtgox versus any service based in the US due to the risk of seizure for any US based service. 
If my account was moved to coin lab without my permission I would immediately close it and attempt to sign up at mtgox again, or another foreign exchange.
If the contract meant giving up US customers then I think mtgox just saved a major revenue stream by not honoring the original contract and will easily make that money back from settling the lawsuit over time.

How does that hurt small businesses? They just could not convert every transaction instantly to their desired currency so likely a company like bitpay would begin to honor the exchange price for all transactions and then bitpay would make large trades to lower the fee for them and the merchant.

where in PP's T&amp;C's does it state that by accepting our 45 day window you not use the chargeback protection of your credit card otherwise we will ban you from PayPal. If they don't want chargebacks then either refund the money or don't accept credit cards. Its that simple.
They PP denied both my requests for a refund due to the 45 day window, so I will be proceeding withe a chargeback. I see no reason that they can close my account for using a feature of my credit card unless by using PayPal I altered the terms of my card agreement.

We don't know what caused the loss of coins so we can't really fully comment on that. 
Given that statement if you used Armory your wallet would only be accessible when your computer is on. Also the encryption used to store and open the wallet is a lot stronger than Blockchains so those 2 things may have prevented this attack.
Best bet would be to use Armory on 2 computers one online and one offline. That would have prevented this attack since you have to physically transfer the coins.

More than one exchange is a a good thing, the problem here is that it sounds like coin lab would get all of mtgox's customers and no person in the US could use mtgox from that point forward.
As a mtgox customer I dont want to be forced to use coin lab, if its by my own free choice that I use coin lab thats great.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:25:21
you have to remember that they exchange the bitcoins for fiat currency at the time of the transaction. That means there is some buyer moving his money from fiat currency to bitcoins so yes the store didn't keep the bitcoins but it basically just bought fiat currency with them and now the bitcoins are immediately back in the potential consumers hands to spend again. 
That means an increase in the velocity of the money happened which I believe in general is a good thing, more cash changing hands means more people get their cut or each deal.
Another plus is the store took little risk accepting the bitcoins.
Ideally though the store could just use the bitcoins to buy its supplies but until that time this is a great alternative that will ideally wane over time.

If you block bots then you will prevent easy arbitrage which is very helpful, it allows the price to be very competitive between the different exchanges.
They are looking out for their best interests by allowing bots since it will in turn allow arbitrage which helps the bitcoin community and creates profit for them.

It all depends on your opinion of what safe wealth storage is. With a Bitcoin I have these advantages:
- Complete control of my money
- Access to it whenever I need it.
- If I want to I can make access a pain in the ass to access it. &lt;- offline wallets, paper wallets, encryption etc.
- I can make copies of my money and store my wealth in multiple locations. Just put an encrypted wallet in an encrypted container on a usb stick and store it somewhere. You could put one in every country you might go to during a crisis.
- Deflationary in nature so I don't lose purchasing power over time.
- Can be anonymously if used in the correct way.
- Not controlled by a single entity or state.
What would you consider a good place that is safe for wealth storage?

They are taxed, when you convert you Bitcoins back to USD if you made money then you owe taxes its like you traded the USD for the CHF and then later exchanged the CHF's back to USD for a profit, you pay taxes on the profit. 
I guess you could argue pos transactions should be taxed but if the government refuses to accept the chosen method of payment how can the tax be paid?
For Bitcoins to be taxed at pos transactions I think they would need to be considered a currency by the US government so that the tax could be paid in Bitcoins.
The gains also might fall under precious metal rules already too but only when realized once converted back to USD.

Actually I believe the theory is that inflationary currencies allow countries to go to war and print money to pay for it.

If they gave reasonable estimates they would not be considered scammers but they always underestimate and under deliver. They always say 2 weeks even though they knew it would be 2 months or more multiple times.

True, we also pay for a ton of other things through inflation, I mean its virtually everything the government does so wars are not the only thing inflation causes.
The overall theme though I believe is that governments can use inflationary currencies to live beyond what the tax base can support. If a government is using sound money (Bitcoin, pegged to gold, pegged to something with a store of value) its  tax base feels the burdens of wars, bailouts, and social programs much sooner and can take action to correct the imbalance. 
With an inflationary currency the government can live beyond what its tax base can support for many many years without the tax payers feeling pinched by rising taxes which can result in a greater hardship down the road for the people than if they were able to correct the over spending problem in its early stages like they hopefully would have done in a sound money system.

That or the whole thing is now an accidental ponzi scheme. 
They overcommitted and the devices costed more than they thought as evidenced by the price increase and the hashing decrease.
Most of the customers funds went into development, and all of BFL's funds went into development, now BFL is running out of cash and does not have enough to support a full production operation.
Now to keep the company alive they have to sell preorders just to keep the cash rolling in order to satisfy the preorders. Since they don't have enough cash they can only build as many items as their preorder cash will let them, and when that runs out they must wait for a new cash influx.
So at this point my theory is they are building the 2012 preorders with money from today's preorders including the chip sales and they need to move slowly or the whole thing will collapse....

currency is evil money is not
How would a deflationary currency decrease investments, its a currency that does not punish people who save the currency since its value should always slowly increase. These savers then have currency that they can now invest but they are still able to increase the value of their currency by just saving. Now the saver has a choice, and will make more prudent investment decisions since he is not punished for saving. I suppose this would decrease investments, but it would force entrepreneurs to create really good new ideas in order to get funding.
With an inflationary currency I would argue this choice is non-existent. Nobody can save their currency since it will lose value therefore everyone must invest in something like stocks. Many will make this investment without research or much thought which I would argue leads to bad ideas or at the very least more risky ideas getting funded.

It wouldn't be worth suing over a &amp;lt;$100 game that not the same thing. Suppose that HP came out with a new pc that had liquid cooling, some crazy new tech and said preorders will be shipping in 2 months. You plunk down $3000 to get the computer and expect that they will be late so it might be 4 months. 1 year later and your order has not arrived and HP who was giving refunds for the last 9 months just decided to stop because they are "shipping". However one month after your order they announced a cheaper model very limited in power that was only $60 and have already shipped through most of the $60 orders despite their order dates being 5 months past mine. Is that what I should expect?
I did a chargeback so I don't need the FTC but any company that treats their customers the way BFL does will not survive long term.
Also it was not a kickstarter, it was a known company who just started into asics, they had a successful fpga mining equipment business going before this situation occurred. They were not new.

So they don't support linux, only Ubuntu?
I can't imagine many CS or CPE majors would stand for that, I'm sure one of them has Arch or some other linux distro running on the network. Ask them what they did, after all the miner is just a linux box accessed through a web interface.

You can make them crack 2 different passwords to get at the funds. Also it doesn't look like a wallet file. I think the question is why not? It takes less than a minute. This is mainly for storage in the cloud or a usb stick that could fall easily into the wrong hands.

1. How are Litecoins a better store of wealth than Bitcoins? 
2. Litecoin is based on the same protocol as Bitcoins which would expose you to almost identical risks. I don't think that is what investment diversification is all about. You want your assets to be exposed to both different risks so if one of the risks actually happens your other diversified assets will most likely be ok. If Bitcoin fails, why would Litecoin succeed?

Even if the USD failed I would expect that a new fiat currency would replace it. Yes we would lose reserve status but I don't think when the USD fails the federal government is going to make a new currency backed by gold and allow every to exchange dollars for it. We would lose lots of real money(gold) to foreign nations.
