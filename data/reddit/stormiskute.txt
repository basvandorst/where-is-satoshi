I think I’ve seen something similar like “you’ve received .527171 btc please go to &lt;virus link&gt; to claim. “Just ignore it. I’d also be wondering where your phone number was sourced from

 Most online stores you’re thinking of don’t really keep the bitcoin from the customers. They just allow customers to spend their bitcoin through a third party facilitator, that instantly converts the bitcoin into usd for the business. Customer pays btc, business receives the accurate amount in usd both parties are happy. This probably isn’t the case for the house, op is likely looking to keep the bitcoin but I’m sure he understands the risks involved.
Can this be linked like on Zillow or something? Interested in the location / inside of it

Posted about an hour ago:
I don’t understand honestly. It breaks so many of the rules here: 
The main one being buying / selling accounts. It’s very unlikely that account never changed hands. 
Abuse and hateful conduct
Abuse: You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so. We consider abusive behavior an attempt to harass, intimidate, or silence someone else’s voice
You also may not use your username, display name, or profile bio to engage in abusive behavior, such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group, or protected category. 
You may not impersonate individuals, groups, or organizations in a manner that is intended to or does mislead, confuse, or deceive others. While you may maintain parody, fan, commentary, or newsfeed accounts, you may not do so if the intent of the account is to engage in spamming or abusive behavior. 
if you sell, purchase, or attempt to artificially inflate account interactions (such as followers, Retweets, likes, etc.);
(Sock puppets) ^
 How is that account even still a thing? It does all of those things in plain view. Twitter just needs to completely suspend it, or since Jack seems to like bitcoin so much, make it an informative page or something. Anything but what it is now

It is possible he did register it, but it’s unlikely. Very unlikely in my opinion
