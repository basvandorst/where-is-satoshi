If you bought a house would you have to pay capital gains tax?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:45:56
I don't live in US so property tax is a bit different here.  I have not taken out any gains as yet but thanks for the advice.

Enough about me, what about you?  Do you have any Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:49:31
Cool. Thanks.

I am not sure if I am understanding your question properly but you can check how much money you have in your wallet by using your public key on the blockchain.  This does not compromise your security because the only way someone can access those bitcoins is using the private key.  
Do not to put your private key online without moving the coins on.

I agree with you.  They are going to try to regulate by saying people lost savings and are killing themselves.
Bitcoin is here to help us to reinvent our financial system.  It is here to allow us to be independent with our finances and not to rely on big businesses to look after our finances.  Relying on big business to look after our wealth is over.  The only safety is in an offline wallet.

Lol. No unfortunately not.  Just a fortune cookie.

That is so awesome! I would love to know who did that.
@_date: 2014-03-12 08:46:35
No. Apparently they sell fortune cookies too.

If this is actually true why has nobody interviewed the man himself?

I'm disappointed.  I thought it was a joke.
