There are some nice altcoins as well that will support the Bitcoin adoption. Crypto.com (MCO) for example got working crypto VISA Cards in Singapore and the US. It's an easy way to spend your Bitcoins.

I wanted to talk about the different approaches of fixing the scalability problem. Bitcoin is trying doing this with off-chain transactions and lightning network. Wanted to make a list of different ways of approaching this same problem and asking you guys for your opinion why the approache of Bitcoin is the best (or why not). But since we are not allowed to 'shill' different ways of approaching this problem (the way Bitcoin is doing it vs the way how other 'shitcoins' are doing it) I will just shut up and talk about moonlambos instead. Since that helps us more.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:43:08
There are more approaches than increasing the blocksize... But don't mind me. I will buy an Orange lambo wen Bitcoin moons! Weeeeeeehh

In my opinion this is bullshit. Spend and replace is more expensive than paying in fiat right now. That's why right now it's not a currency. In the future it might become a currency, but before that I need to be able to get paid in BTC at my local job, because right now spend and replacing is killing it. That's why I'm one of the holders. Right now it's digital GOLD, but not a currency yet. It might become a currency in the future. That's the moment I will start spending it, but not before that.

@_date: 2018-08-06 07:52:27
Yup, within 20 years the USD will be dead (hyperinflation) and Bitcoin will take over. Bitcoin will be worth infinite (in USD) then. You will have to pay in sats for your coffee then.

It's not a meme. You think to much in fiat. 1BTC will always be 1BTC. No1 can ever steal that from you. The same is with doge. 1Đ will always be 1Đ. And btw, I'm a bitcoin hodler, but at the same time I'm a happy doge hodler. Perfect combination if you ask me.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:49:32
Most people pay a fee for buying BTC, so spending and replacing BTC is disadvantageous.

Zimbabwe was before Venezuela. More small countries will follow with Hyperinflation and then the big currencies will fall like the ¥, £, € and finally the $. Bitcoin will overtake them all because it has no inflation (after 100 years) and because Bitcoin is the first World Currency. You can accept and spend Bitcoins everywere you want.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:23:10
There are ~$100,000,000,000,000 in the world and only 21,000,000BTC. With $1,000,000 (0.000001% of the total supply) you can buy a big house, a great car and even more. In the future that will be the same with 0.021BTC (0.000001% of the total supply).
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:38:44
Don't sell... just buy stuff with it when it takes out all the fiat currencies.

@_date: 2019-11-28 07:40:36
I’m not a maximalists. I hodl a competitive as well. Bitcoin will succeed as gold in it’s current state, but can’t replace the global financial system yet. If Bitcoin wants to replace currencies like the USD it should be fast (instant) and cheap (free). Bitcoin is trying to do this with the help of Lightning Network. At the same time their is a coin that tries to do the same thing without the help of a second layer. You can do your own research to find out which coin that is. Besides that I hodl a coin that allows you to spend Cryptocurrencies through the VISA network (a short-term second layer solution). Again do your own research to find out which coin that is.
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:02:06
Moving bitcoin from one wallet to another with Lightning Network is instant and nearly without fees.

Dunno what the reason is, but all brokers here ask a ‘small’ flat yearly based fee. For big investors with €100.000+ it’s nothing, but for small investors like me (~€2.000) paying a €30+ fee every year for being able to buy/hodl/sell stocks is a lot.

Yes and in 2020 it will be 6,25 coins. That is less inflation than gold. And look at the gold price/USD. In 1999 gold was ~300 USD it's now worth ~1300 USD. The inflation of the USD is real and you will see it in the gold and Bitcoin prices. Wait 2020 or even futher 2030 or something and you will see.

Some prefer seedless security, like Casa, coldcard allows seedless mnemonic backup via encrypted 7z archive on microSD.  The coldcard handles the backup and restore, so the 7z never needs to touch a computer."
Can I generate two 24-word seeds with a hardware wallet, split them up in two 12-word seeds and combine them into one 24-word seed? So that even if the hardware wallet factory knows what kind of 24-word seeds my device generates I will still be safe.

The computer shipping thing can be easily done with a smart contract... You deposit the funds in a smart contract. The package got a QR code on it. If you scan the QR code on the package the seller gets the money. If you don't you get your money back (after the set timelock of the smart contract). The seller just needs to make sure that the buyer scans the QR code. One problem with that is that the buyer should be at home when the delivery takes place.

A better cryptocurrency, but that isn’t a problem as long as you are here for the technology. If you are here for the money then it is.
@_date: 2019-04-19 15:57:17
The central bank is creating inflation with all the money they print... so it's a bank fee.

@_date: 2019-04-06 14:15:57
Bitcoin is censoring as well!

No a private key is everything you need
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:34:37
So you think bitcoin is like bitconnect?
@_date: 2018-11-18 00:38:57
~X25 in a few years looks like a great deal. I'm in ��
@_date: 2018-11-26 05:40:59
WHAT BOTTOM?!
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:11:58
I hope crypto.com (one of Ledgers partners) will use the Ledger Nano X for their mobile app.
@_date: 2019-01-14 05:40:51
I have a hodl and a trade wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-01 10:09:41
7.34 / 500 = ~1.47% fee. What is your problem?
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:24:35
Still a 2.1% spread between buying and selling. That's a 1.05% fee each time.
@_date: 2019-01-22 16:56:47
Give me one good reason why it WILL NOT replace fiat, tyvm!
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:07:13
No... in 20 years time the supply of euro's will atleast be doubled while the demand will be decreased. With bitcoins it's the other way around. The demand will increase while the supply will decrease (people sending bitcoins to a non-existing wallet will decrease the supply).
10 years ago the stuff that were €50 are now €70 euro. That's a 40% increase.
On a bank you get ~0,5% while the inflation is 2%+ When you do nothing with your money your money will be worth nothing. So invest in something with a supply cap like bitcoins or gold.
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:17:39
So we need fiat, because... The poor need papermoney? Haven't you seen what happend with Venezuela yet? They are all trying to sell their Bolívar for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-28 07:06:45
For every buyer there is a seller and for every seller there is a buyer.

@_date: 2019-01-01 10:25:31
Were I buy my Bitcoins with EURs (I'm from the Netherlands) there is a 2.7% difference between buying and selling. That's a ~1.35% fee each time. I'm happy to sell all my EURs for that kind of fee.
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:59:52
My savings are in Bitcoin... So yeah I'm a hodler.

A smart contract between two wallets that holds the funds up to one week. This allows buyers and sellers interact with each other. If the delivery takes more than one week the buyer will get his funds back. If the delivery is on time the buyer scans the QR code on the package and the seller will receive it's money.
@_date: 2019-01-26 08:28:15
Only the new ones?

Here was a competition... 
Someone was able to send only 1 millisatoshi. That's a thousandth of a satoshi �� That's 0.00000000001 BTC

A friend of me told me about it. I'm happy he did.
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:01:56
Bitcoin is digital gold. It's the better version of the gold standard we once had.
@_date: 2019-01-20 07:17:21
True, the reversal will start soon. It's highly oversold right now.
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:29:25
Maybe they have multiple mining pools...
@_date: 2019-01-01 17:30:48
A nice donation if you ask me
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:07:37
Mining BTC is always profitable for the people that have low electricity costs. When the price of BTC drops or when the difficulty increases competitors with a higher cost than you will drop out and will make mining profitable for you again. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:10:25
Try BitMEX :)
@_date: 2019-01-04 18:31:24
It's digital gold, but you should decide for yourself.
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:57:51
Problem with buying gold is that there are high fees (~20%) if you buy small amounts and you can't use it to buy products in stores. A gold stablecoin would have small fees and can easily be traded for products. USD was the same in the past when we still had the Gold Standard...
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:26:17
No, Bitcoin is a currency that you can split up in smaller parts... Satoshi (10-8 BTC) is currently the smallest fraction of Bitcoin. With Lightning Network it's even possible to go smaller, but that's by using a second or even third layer.
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:57:01
He got 0.0105BTC ��
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:27:41

@_date: 2019-01-26 23:34:38
Most people will be buying at 100k+
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:08:33
He got an ATH $200 paid in Bitcoins.

I was looking for a Satoshi wallpaper on Google Images and only found Ash Ketchum images. I totally forgot that Satoshi is the Japanese name for the main protagonist of the Pokémon anime we known as Ash Ketchum. Kinda funny ��

For buying a different currency? If you buy EUR with USD you pay a 7% fee. Be happy you can buy Bitcoin this cheap.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:07:04
30% of the people from the Netherlands are buying their crypto from litebit.eu I'm fine with my dealer
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:22:37
I would prefer a stable coin based on gold. Bring back the Gold Standard!
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:51:56
USD and EUR are risky investments as well.
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:15:48
Bitcoin flippens fiat*
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:08:29
The only thing I sell is fiat
@_date: 2019-01-02 16:10:00
Maybe it has something to do with their partnership with crypto.com
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:41:20
True, but it will happen eventually. Before Christ comes it's one of the signs that need to be done.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:01:02
That was an example. You can do the same with $100 instead of $18,000.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:39:38
The package deliverer needs to make sure the buyer scans the QR code when he delivers the package. If the buyer doesn't want to scan the QR code he takes the package back to the seller again.

Problem is... Most altcoins don't see the difference between a blockchain and a database.
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:53:44
Then don't invest all your money at once...

I hodl since my SAVINGS are in Bitcoin. Hodling is no meme. It means you understand that Bitcoin is a store of value no matter what the price does.
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:57:08
If you add a Doger (Joker) I buy it.

Inflation + supply and demand

Yeah true, maybe ask him if we need altcoins if lightning network is finished. Most Bitcoin maximalists believe that we don’t need any other coins besides BTC after lightning network if fully functional. I would love to know his few about this.

I know... I'm not stupid.

MCO, it gives a Cryptocurrency related Visa Card that let you spend Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:52:55
I don't talk about the small gains. If the cards are released this summer MCO will be a top 20 coin easily. Only  right now.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:12:48
BTC will be above 300k in the year 2020. Mark my words!
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:39:47
The Big Four are kinda busy with cryptocurrency. Makes me very bullish :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:34:00
Is my Ledger Nano S still fine?
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:07:53
I do, but I look everything in BTC and try to gain more of it.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:22:37
1) 
2) Financial crisis (stock market and house market)
3) FIAT interest rate
4) Lightning Network
5) Worldwide adoption
6) More mining power
7) Bitcoin is the first World Currency
8) Hyperinflation (look Venezuela, more countries will follow, first small then big).
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:01:15
It's still a great time to invest and trade to get more crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:10:50
People that say Bitcoin is not free and instant never used Lightning Network.
@_date: 2018-07-30 09:33:29
In Venezuela the government is against cryptocurrency. Still it's being used by the people.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:37:00
Crypto.com (MCO) is a Cryptocurrency related Visa Card that let you spend your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-04 05:36:25
Haha, wait 2 years and you will see. Bitcoin is being accepted more and more.
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:58:10
It's not about selling... It's about spending! Just buy a house with Bitcoins instead of fiat.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:47:11
Yeah Monaco is called CRYPTO.com now. The project is still called MCO tho. Amazing how low the market cap still is.

Getting rid of 3rd parties takes time. Give it another 5-10 years and you will see the first steps of it. Anyways... I'm a crypto investor not because I hate 3rd parties. I'm investing, because I hate inflation.

That could be, but it's all about the longrun. I have more faith in MCO than in TenX for the longrun, but that's my opinion.

@_date: 2018-12-30 10:24:40
$ and € could go to zero as well. Don't put more money in fiat than you are prepared to lose!
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:56:56

Just noise or the start of the biggest economic crisis of all time.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:18:41
Most people invest in real estate, stocks and gold, because it's a store of value compared to fiat. Since the creation of Bitcoin there is a real store of value in our world. With the current stock crash a 70-80% drop is possible since there is a store of value alternative called Bitcoin.
