Haha yes I'm aware my fee was too low this time around as there was an updraught in BTC fees as I placed it, which can be seen on many graphs. Unfortunately I hadn't checked the usual site to check the recommended fee and was unaware it had risen in the last few hours before I broadcast the TX. 
I understand how it works fine well, I just shows set a fee to that was too low this time around, not that I don't understand how it works. I asked for the best way to speed it up since I didn't enable RBF. Your first suggestion was great but everything that followed wasn't.


The fact you said this leads me to disregard a lot of what you said as it is evidently an online based bitcoin wallet! Maybe my answer wasn't as technical as it could have been but I'm by no means new to crypto

Thank you for the reply! I was just looking into that there as it seems coinb.in does indeed support it. However, the transaction has just confirmed 5 minutes ago. Only took 5 hours! I'll use a higher fee next time! I didn't notice the recommended fee had risen as I hadn't checked beforehand

Coinb.in is a browser based bitcoin wallet as it says on their website. I prefer having control over the fees I send. There's no reason I should have to just use a fast or slow option when wallets like coinb.in are free to be used by anyone. To say it is only for a select few when it's available to anyone is nonsense. As is saying it's not a wallet. I donate a little almost everytime I broadcast a transaction so I don't see why I would be hindering the service by using it.
