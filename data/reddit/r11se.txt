Perfect time for newbies to buy in low and reap the rewards of hoarding.  Don't be so short sighted.  Go back and look at the curve from 2009 to now.  Hold and stop panicking!!  Buy and hold.  Of your in, your in.  Otherwise, get out of the way.

Buy and hold.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:58:27
To many merchants that instantly convert you btc into fiat helps no one.  Buying and holding, then selling to vendors who hold and spend closes the loop tightening the supply.

It will be a good thing.  The FBI will not get top dollar and a ton of people will get a chance to buy in low before price tightens up again.  It might sound like a lot, but 30K is not that big of a numer.  Once the sell is over this will be old news.

Great article.  Closing the loop is something I talk about all the time with bitcoin and I think it is a very important concept to understand how closing the loop affects price.  Ownership od bitcoin can be transfered endlessly with out affecting the price.  It is only when exchanging it with another currency when supply and demand is relevant.  As the loop closes, and transactions happen between peers for goods and  services with out exchanging, the price is more likely to stabilize or slowly rise.  Because less coins are being exchanged back out into another currency,  the likely hood of the demand for new buyers will rise.  The same way the saving bitcoins make the price rise also works when sending them to new a dresses within the loop that do not sell them.  I strongly advise that any bitcoin holders only spend with Merchants that also hold.  Don't convert back into other currencies unless absolutely necessary.   
Thank you for the article.

It gets easier every day and it is achievable.   Going back to 2010 when I heard about bitcoin first it would have been hard to imagine that it would have even gotten this far.  Now there is real momentum and a compounding effect happening.  The loop could start to close very quickly.

These cheap bitcoins are being bought up slowly by hoarders like myself who continue to buy no matter what the price is.  It is only a matter of time until the laws of supply and demand drive the price sky high.  Haters keep hating.   It just makes it easier to buy in from the panic sells.

I'm 100% with you.  Economics is not that difficult to understand.   I like to remember when I first heard about bitcoin and it was $0.30  My favorite feature was that the supply would be limited to only 21 million.  I think the collectors will end up in a great position.

@_date: 2014-08-19 13:40:52
I completely agree with this.  When the loop closes and merchants hold the bitcoin the the selling presume will be dramatically less.  There will be less bitcoin on the open market available to buy and supply will he tightened, driving the price up.  Right now it is good for exposure that bitcoiners get excited to buy from new merchants accepting bitcoin, but it is driving the price down in my opinion.  The answer is to spend with me chants that hold.  Hopefully soon the merchants will be able to pay employees and vendors with bitcoin which will also help close the loop.  
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:21:19
This is still totally good news though.  
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:54:25
I agree with your points of Merchant adoption outpacing user demand.  However, this is still great news for bitcoin as every merchant that accepts brings a level of legitimacy to potential new users, and adds usefulness to the network.  What will drive the price up is new users (and old user),buying and saving more than anything IMO.

Anybody thing there is a chance that a high for of encryption can be found and implemented into the Bit coin protocol if found?  Meaning, if quantum computing comes along that breaks all current encryption,  now what?  Historically encryption and Cypher have been a long running game of cat and mouse.  Is there a theoretical end point where information becomes impossible to keep hidden? Or the other way around, a point where everything becomes encrypted?  Thinking out loud.

Wired has been the voice of the establishment for a long time.  This is just one example of towing the party line rather than writing based on logic.  It makes me trust and like bitcoin more when groups like this act like this. As if the so called experts have spoken, so they must be right.

The bitcoin economy,  although still small is kick ass once you get into it.  A large % of my friends and family now have bitcoin so it makes it easy to use without having to consider converting back to fiat.  
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:34:10
Move all of your coin to DEEP secure cold storage and hold.  Remember, that buying back in,  or doubling down will lower your original price per coin once price rebounds.  Think long term.  The lesson I learned on Mt gox is not to trade, just save.  Hope this helps

Just like buying a house or any other asset, you have lost nothing until you sell.   I was in this same position on a house that I bought in 2007 when the market tanked in 2008.  At first I though I had lost all of my money and that I should just cut my loses.   Finally logic kicked in and nd I held.  Not the house is worth more than when I bought it.  Just hold until you want to sell, never sell because you feel you have lost.

Buy a couple of milibits instead of the next soda, beer, coffee, and send to a paper wallet.  There are plenty of easy ways to make secure paper wallets now that you can further encrypt and save a back up of in a safe place.  Scan them into a watch only wallet and ride the waves.  Good luck mate.  I habe 3 btc stollen from EmtyGOX way before they went down.  It was depressing but I learned all the rules and now I am better off for it.

It's only a loss I'd you sell lower than you bought.  Just hold until your above water again and start spending with bitcoin accepting merchants.  In the mean time, keep buying at lower prices and lower your average per coin.  Hard to loose this way in the long run with b the bitcoin protocol looking like it will b a around for a long time to come, and everyone here still being an early adopter.

The only problem I see with so many merchants jumping on board is the downward pressure it creates on price when they all instantly convert into fiat.

It is a now brainer coming from myself who operates a restaurant that frequently accepts bitcoin as a form of payment.  I truly believe it is that most restaurant operations just have not properly been exposed to the benifits.

I agree that we need to see the bulls keep buying above 300 at least for a little while to fully say that we are now consistently on the up and up.  But the near market definitely feels over from the long slide last year.  Now we are slowly but surly climbing which is the healthy way to go.  The rocket ship,  as fun as it is to ride, gets too much of the wrong attention too quickly.  Slow and steady wins the race.  Keep stacking that Coinbase up.
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:02:42
I would say, IMO, that if no more bitcoins where ever stolen and wallet/key security was solved, the trust alone would make mass adoption much more appealing.   More people will feel comfortable holding more funds in bitcoin.  
Hopefully soon, everyone is using multiple signatures and 2FA, with their own funds, and everyone stops holding their funds on insecure exchanges.

Lol.  I think the writer of this article missed it by a mile.  Add it to the pile.  It's going to be a good day when this gets put to shame.

Stick with Bitcoin for purchasing and holding.   Play around with others.

I do not think bitcoin will ever die.  Evolve yes.  Die,  no way.

Great article

Bitcoin is not a currency.....  oh wait,  that's right, It is used as a currency every day.  Looking forward to enough time passing that this misconception dies.  Bitcoin has been, and is a currency.

Save!!  Are you kidding with this question?

I recommend just talking in person over anything else if any when you can.  There are many successful business to point at that are accepting bitcoin.  Good email though.  Good luck, and don't mind all the armchair haters on reddit.

Hopefully.   By deflation meaning the increase of purchasing power.  The same way gold is affected when less is mined.

I love them both.  I still recommend that you hold your own keys and not leave them to a third party.   But, for buying bitcoin, these two companies rock!!

Never a bad time to invest in Bitcoin.  Just don't sell or spend  low
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:54:15
Don't be so scared.  I have been holding large amounts for years with no issues.   Use paper wallets, barware wallets, or online insured vaults.

Never sell something free with this much potential upside.   Almost every person (myself included) that I know that got cheap coins sold out early and now regrets it.  You should post back here in 2 years with the outcome.

No it is not a threat.  The foundation does not have that much power over the protocol.   Furthermore,   I believe that everyone associated with the foundation,  is associated by their own free will due to being motivated to help bitcoin.  
Haters gonna hate...

Right on!  Looking forward to anywhere near this mark.

Buy, spend , save.  Just buy and hold more than you spend.  Or use Bitwage to earn, spend, save.  This way as long as you are saving a health amount, you are holding and using.  Holding is healthy.  Hoard all you can afford not to use.

I keep having the same problem with blockchain and it is driving me nuts.
