If we consider an Altcoin to be a coin with a blockchain independent of Bitcoin, than the sidechains development *does* become extremely competitive with innovations like Ethereum.
To become "more viable" the altcoins must ditch their blockchains and join the Bitcoin chain as a sidechain.
This is blowing my mind. This is how the protocol effect takes hold and doesn't let go. Buckle up, we just jumped into a new dimension.

Jeffrey, don't you think the price is important for compensating those early users and developers?
After all, the early adopters are needed to build out the functionality of Bitcoin. They test the network. They innovate on top of the network. Without them, Bitcoin would progress at a much slower pace, making it a much less useful system.
The price is also important because a larger market cap (for lack of a more accurate term) is needed to facilitate large value transactions.
Great write up though!

Price absolutely does matter. 
Billion dollar business trade cannot be made using a 7 Billion dollar market cap.
An increase in price also funds speculators, whose investments are responsible for paying early adopters/developers and getting the movement started.
A price increase also means that there is a greater preference by the public to hold cryptocurrency, presumably in place of fiat currency. *That* **IS** the movement. 
How can the price be unimportant?

I picture something similar on its way. I do believe autonomous agents can fulfill this task, but whatever the innovation is, on the long run I imagine further decentralization.
Centralization is cheap only because we know how it works. That's why gasoline powered vehicles are still cheaper than electric cars. But technology is gravitating towards individual empowerment and decentralized systems.
So I agree that centralization has a better shot at solving the micro transaction problem sooner than decentralization, but with the pace of innovation occurring right now...who really knows?

Stock market is up like crazy despite the economy. Bond market is up despite (actually a consequence of) US monetary policy. Housing never settled and is climbing again because the fed buys up Mortage backed securities. Food is mighty expensive.
Monetary inflation does not affect prices immediately, nor does it affect all industries the same.
Those who receive the counterfeited money first benefit the most at the expense to those it reaches later. Banks get the cheapest money of all as they have privileges with the Fed.
The US is also exporting it's inflation due to the dollar being the world reserve currency. This means that other countries keep dollars in reserve (savings) because of the dollar's perception as a stable money.
When confidence in the dollar begins to decline, less countries/entities will use it as a reserve. They will want less dollars, flooding the market, and steepening the rate of price inflation.
For now, due to the declining economy, we are also at risk of deflation. No one wants to spend money because they can't afford to. If inflation picks up, they won't be able to afford *not* spending, as the future purchasing power of the dollar rapidly declines.
The IMF will need to bail out the Fed just as the fed needed to bail out the banks the last time around.
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:01:07
You are effectively asking to tax savers, to reduce their incentive to save, and increase their incentive to spend.
Bitcoin was created very purposefully to escape the Keynesian fallacies that propose a spending driven economy.
Altcoins should be used for experimental inflation or deflation rates. Bitcoin adopters should not have the monetary supply changed post-investment and be robbed of their savings.

Bitcoin is currently inflating and will for some time. It is also undergoing price deflation because demand for Bitcoin is increasing more quickly than its money supply. Should this trend continue, saving will be a realistic way to increase purchasing power.
This is definitely not the first time a society has used a money which rewards savings. Gold and silver have been money for 5000+ years. The inflation rate of these metals has always been quite low. Just like Bitcoin, mining a specific quantity is becoming more difficult with time.

Solid and practical read for what is sure to be a highly controversial area of law as smart contracts become a real thing in the years to come.
Abstract: 
"A new technology called “smart contracts” has emerged. What makes these legal agreements innovative is that their execution is made automatic through the use of computers. This Article examines smart contracts from a legal perspective. Specifically, this Article explains smart contracts’ operation and place in existing contract law. It introduces a distinction between strong and weak smart contracts, as defined by the costs of their revocation and modification. The article concludes that smart contracts are simply a new form of preemptive self-help that should not be discouraged by the legislatures or courts. While certain unconscionable examples of strong smart contracts may need to be policed, judges and policymakers should foster a climate that treats smart contracts as another form of more traditional agreements."

Possibly never. Either it’s not often attempted or the incentive to try is not there. It’s unlikely anyone trading considerable amounts of coin would consider a trade complete with only 0 or 1 confirmation.

Currently the network is not congested so transactions are entering blocks at relatively low fees. 
For low priced transactions, most merchants are not concerned about waiting for confirmations because the cost of cheating the system (“double spending”) is greater than the value gained from the attack. A transaction without any confirmations is called a 0 confirmation or “0 conf” transaction. 
Waiting for a greater number of confirmations is recommended when the value of the transaction is higher. For example, 6 confirmations is safe enough for a transaction valued in the millions. This means waiting about an hour on average, assuming a competitive fee was included.

The climbs in previous Bitcoin bubbles were very comparable to the past 2 weeks of this current one. If history were to repeat itself (no guarantee of that), Bitcoin would peak at about 10k +/- 2k USD before "popping."
Nobody should assume everything happens exactly the same though. Maybe it pops quicker, slower, or it fizzles instead of pops.

It is possible that by the time bitcoin inflation drops or stops (year 2140), it will be so user friendly that nearly no coins are lost. Fail safes such as time locks and Oracle based event triggers may prevent coin loss as we know it today.

The reality is that disputes *will* arise and government will be involved, so proposing the least stifling approach to regulation is better done sooner than later. 
In fact, I think the author would agree with you in many ways. For example, from the Abstract: "smart contracts are simply a new form of preemptive self-help that should not be discouraged by the legislatures or courts."

Good point. They are certainly stretching the definition of "cold wallet" though. How long of a delay until a wallet is considered cold? Cold is not supposed to be "delayed," it's supposed to mean not accessible.

It will never be deflationary from a monetary stand point, which is the traditional definition. The only chance of the bitcoin monetary base becoming deflationary is if the rate of lost bitcoins exceeds the newly minted bitcoins.
Price deflation (measured against fiat) is a separate subject and that can happen if demand for bitcoin rises such that it is valued more than fiat. Lesser increases in demand are needed as the bitcoin mining halves and halves...

Terror suspect Mohammed Ammer Ali attempted to purchase ricin, a deadly poison and illegal chemical weapon, from overseas via the dark web, using Bitcoins
The legitimacy of virtual currency may well have gained so much ground over the last year that Bitcoin exchanges and technology providers have gone from being a fringe industry that plays host to a decentralized, anonymous digital purchasing method with little or no recourse should things go awry, to a fully regulated, alternative payment system with technological infrastructure backed by large venture capital firms.
However despite these tremendous advancements that have set Bitcoin on the road to the mainstream via high quality security measures and technological projects backed by multi-million dollar corporations, there is another aspect that could cause international governments and financial markets regulators to take a dim view: terrorist funding.
Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist funding procedures are instrumental to the regulatory remit of the vast majority of FX firms, and indeed traditional financial institutions, therefore Bitcoin would be subject to similar stipulations in regions such as Switzerland, whose SBEX virtual currency exchange is regulated by Swiss Bank regulator FINMA, and New York, where the BitLicense provides a regulatory framework to Bitcoin venues.
Yesterday, in Liverpool, England, a very real danger became apparent, having been funded anonymously by using Bitcoin.
Mohammed Ammer Ali was arrested by counter terrorism officers and charged with attempting to obtain the fatal poison ricin.
Mr. Ali was detained by Police following a series of raids in Liverpool which took place last week, and was due to appear in court yesterday morning accused of attempting to obtain a chemical weapon.
The possession and acquisition of ricin is illegal in the United Kingdom, as it is in the vast majority of jurisdictions globally, as it is 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide which has recently been obtained and used by suspected terrorists across the United States.
According to a report by the Daily Telegraph, Mr. Ali attempted to purchase the ricin from overseas via the dark web, using Bitcoins.
Five vials of powder were contained within the battery pack of a radio controlled car, enough to poison over 100 people. A legal source has confirmed that this particular powder was not ricin, however Mr. Ali’s digital currency-funded attempts to acquire the real thing were indeed well underway before being foiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) in the United States and British authorities.
The Telegraph’s report continues to explain that Mr. Ali was charged after attempting to pay $500 for 500 milligrams of ricin.
Prosecution Mark Dawson: “He attempted to buy 500 milligrams of ricin but this was a sting operation by the FBI in cooperation with British authorities.”
Mr Dawson said Ali had to the FBI officers he said he “would become a repeat purchaser.”
Whilst Mr. Ali may well face the music for his attempts to obtain the illegal and deadly substance, this activity calls into question compliance issues which surround Bitcoin, and make a clear point that it is not just the potential hacking of secure wallets and theft of Bitcoins from exchanges, an area which Bitcoin firms have invested heavily in, that is of concern, but also the inability to mitigate the use of Bitcoins for nefarious, and downright dangerous, purposes compared to the relative ease of doing so with fiat currency.

Gold itself is highly fungible. You are trying to compare the raw element with a product.
The same goes for physical bitcoin. Value of these coins varies dramatically depending on condition and source.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:57:47
To be even more semantic, bitcoin is *not* deflationary. It is inflationary and eventually will be static in supply (unless you assume lost or destroyed coins in the future, but these are only possibilities, not certainties.)
Inflation and deflation define the money supply. *Price* deflation and *price* inflation define the purchasing power.

It's a ripoff for buying anything fixed to the bitpay exchange price
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:27:28
Inflation and deflation refer to the money supply. If more money is issued, that is inflation. If money is destroyed, that’s deflation.
Bitcoin is inflationary until around the year 2140 when no new bitcoin will be issued.
However, Bitcoin is undergoing rapid *price* deflation. This means the purchasing power of a bitcoin is increasing. In other words, it’s becoming more valuable compared to other goods.
Typically, a money undergoing inflation (increased supply) will decrease in value because the newly issued money dilutes the rest. Bitcoin, even though its still undergoing inflation, is increasing in value because the demand for new bitcoin is outpacing it’s supply.
Inflation: more money supply created
Deflation: less money supply (supply destroyed)
Price Inflation: increased prices 
Price Deflation: decreased prices 
Bitcoin is inflationary and price deflationary.

As I understand it, modern front running is a product of proximity to exchanges. Trading firms buy up the real estate closest to the exchange so that they can retrieve information and issue orders faster than the rest of the market.
Bitcoin exchanges are much more dispersed in comparison so I imagine that at least this type of front running is less of a concern.

If the risk is that the asset may depreciate at any point, both methods involve that risk.
If the investment is intended for long term and the cash is on hand, dollar cost averaging only removes profit, assuming the asset rises in the long run.
