Relaying blocks from 2 years ago really isn't that important and is probably a worse use of the bitcoin peer to peer network bandwidth that relaying recent transactions. You can download most of the blockchain from a torrent or http download and still independently verify 100% of it. I would like to see an option on wallets to perhaps keep the most recent x number of blocks, because those are less likely to be available elsewhere. Remember, the way you get blocks doesn't really matter. That's the whole point. Everyone can independently verify transactions and block proofs of work.
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:24:22
Well for a coinjoin to work all parties involved in the join need to know the transaction information of the others. But if you do several chains in a row, it might be pretty secure. You would only need a central party for finding peers, but this could be DHT or whatever like torrents use.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:53:30
So... tor hidden services? Woah, what an original idea
@_date: 2015-06-05 02:59:04
I don't think so. Lots of people actually don't want it raised.

There's really no reason to believe this. He is not the ultimately authority of knowledge on bitcoin, and I'm sure he agrees with that.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:40:52
We can't expect most users to understand technological aspects of bitcoin. They need good, easy, software that can contribute to the network without pissing them off (by taking up their harddrive with something they don't understand)

Last commit on github also 3 months ago. Not even a typo fix or styling change. Seems that the dev team gas stopped... But since its open source another group or individual can pick it up. Perhaps amir ran with the money after their donation campaign.

Sigh... I've only heard her on the show like twice. No, I don't know her name and was typing that in a hurry so didn't look it up. Its like describing "the black guy at the party". Its not discriminatory. I just do not know her name and her sex is the easiest way to distinguish her from the rest of the hosts. I don't dislike her because she is a woman, I dislike her because she has proven that she has very little knowledge about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:50:29
I would say its not really a waste of a block, because it is more proof of work an attacker would have to provide to double spend. It still provides the security function of a block.

@_date: 2014-04-03 00:13:43
Not really. It allows you to broadcast a transaction with a lower fee, but it is unlikely that miners will include your transaction in its block. In fact, fees will almost surely go up consistently over time. Luckily, there are things such as coinjoin and off block chain transactions that should make this a non issue.

@_date: 2014-05-04 22:05:50
Probably troll, but anyways its called mining software. You use your computer power to secure the bitcoin network. Most people do this with super fast specialized devices, so it will probably cost you more in electricity than you'll make in bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-03 20:05:49
This. But even better, two factor, multisig, and cold storage.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:02:47
And if you don't want to use ptp pool, at least use a smaller pool. A pool with even 10% of the hashing power has more than enough for very regular payouts. Fuck, even use btcguild and delay this shit a few more months. Dont ruin bitcoin because you're too lazy to switch you pool.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:53:35
What do you mean by "work full time with bitcoin"? Are you developing a busisness around it or hoping to get rich trading it? Let me tell you right away that quitting your job to trade an extremely volatile asset with little knowledge about it is an incredibly bad idea. There is a very small chance that you will get lucky, but you will probably lose money and go into considerable debt.

I never trust software written in java. Electrum all the way.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:39:04
For now, yes. But don't feel inclined to run the full stock bitcoin client with that little hard drive space. Checkout clients like multibit that hardly take up any space.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:12:32
Correct. Though I suppose its possible that your public key of you have on a online watch only client could be compromised. Ain't no harm in updating, but you probably don't need to transfer to a new address.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:41:56
This is so terrible. I'm glad they're at least doing something. I bet the cex.io is a lot of the hashing power. If they switched all of those miners to P2Pool it would be so awesome.
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:34:20
The next version of bitcoin-core is working at making fees more of a market decision, but this does not mean that fees are going down. There are still an insane amount of miners buying insanely expensive equipment at an insane rate who only will want to mine blocks with transactions that will make their irresponsible purchases profitable. Plus a group of idiots still think blocks should remain at a 1MB limit, with will really push fees up even higher as bitcoin's transaction volume grows. Even more, we're less than two years away from another block reward halfing, which will also drive fees up. Economics wise, there is no reason for fees to go down. Better start looking at off-chain for micropayments.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:07:23
Can't you pick which pool you mine on with cex.io?

This is a terrible idea. The blockchain is bloated enough with real data 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:41:05
The only advantage of larger pools is more regualr payouts. A pool with 30% of the hashing power or so should payout to its miners nearly every half an hour. But you right, people really should join smaller pools. I really sucks that people keep joining Ghash and BTC guild. It leads to centralization and potential double spending.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:48:40
To encourage people to start using P2Pool, we should fund/contribute to development of it. Make it more efficient and more importantly make it easy to use. We need Guis, etc.
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:11:49
Stop thinking of altcoins as threats to bitcoin. Though it is sad that most are made to get the creators and early adopters rich, they usually add some interesting concept that might some day be implemented into bitcoin. Competition is good.

@_date: 2014-06-04 01:21:28
Perhaps it would be feasible with a lower block time. The main incentive to pool is more regular payouts. 10 minutes makes no sence. I think that we could even leverage orphaned block's hash to make a stronger blockchain with a lower block time. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 11:12:54
Well it has coin join, whitch is really good for privacy. Stealth addresses are pretty overrated. And it connects to a server whitch it receives balances for all of your addresses over, so that server could potentially link addrsees to IPs if it was being malicious. In the end, coin join is the only feature that separates it from most clients, and that won't be true for long. It is, however, shaping up to be a fantastic feature full wallet, but saying its super privacy concerned isn't totally accurate currently.
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:14:21
That's the current transaction fee. Bitcons tx fee was nothing at Doges point of development.
@_date: 2014-04-18 11:16:08
IMO that's good. The hashing power was growing much quicker than the overall value of bitcoin and its community. I don't want fees to go up even more because someone blows 100k on ASICs.
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:44:33
Dark wallet just hasn't done anything interesting yet. If anything, it has less privacy features than other wallets which are more time tested.
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:12:20
I've started using coinbase, a much less private and secure wallet because they pay your transaction fees.

Keep it going, it should be AT LEAST bellow 30. Any pool over 10 percent is ridiculous and unnecessary.

First of all, cloud mining is not profitable and neither is cex.io so I do not recommend it. However, if cex.io were to make its miners by default use P2Pool I would be totally okay with it.

@_date: 2014-06-11 15:58:44
Its not just miners with all the power, but nodes too. If miners like the fork but nodes don't, the miners will be wasting their hashing on a chain that is not being used by most nodes.

@_date: 2014-03-04 18:12:25
That's kind of a lot, considering you're just sending an SMS and signing a transaction. I mean I could host something similar on my raspberry pi.
Edit: saw that you can always move funds for free with just your 2 keys. In this case it is fairly well priced
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:13:57
Its not the same dollar cost... How is this dollar cost averaging?
Dollar cost averaging is investing the same dollar amount in a consistent interval. For example, if you bought $100 worth of bitcoin on the 10th of every month. You did not purchase a consistent dollar amount worth of bitcoin or a consistent amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:42:19
A better way to so that might be with a deterministic wallet like electrum. Put it on a flash drive with Ubuntu and boot into an offline computer. It will generate a random 12 word string from which you can derive an infinite number of addresses. The coolest part however is that you can get a "Master public key" whitch will allow you to generate only the public keys of your wallet. So print out the 12 word master private key and put the master public key on electrum on all of your computers. Now you can check the balances of and see all the public keys of your wallet from an online computer with no risk of them being stollen!

The way I see it, there's nothing bad about change proposals on a decentralized network running open source software. If he wants to think up some ideas and write some code for them, great!

@_date: 2014-08-23 18:36:52
It's a peer to peer network not a server client model. Just the listings, which every node will need to have, would likely be several terabytes at any given time if it had the hundreds of thousands that eBay has, each with pictures and other metadata.

@_date: 2014-08-03 22:39:18
Blockchain.Info's is the only trustless one I know of, and is quite cheap. However, all the other parties involved in the transaction I believe know which inputs and outputs are yours. All services require you to tell either the party running the service or other people involved in the transaction your inputs and outputs so far. Theoretically one could design a service where no one knows your inputs and outputs using tor or zero knowledge computation but I don't think anyone is really even close.

If torrents are so much faster than what bitcoin uses, why doesn't bitcoin-core just use the bittorrent protocol for downloading the blockchain with some adjustments for dynamicness?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:37:41
Well no one should have ever trusted Mt. Gox. They have such a terrible record, I can't believe people still had so much BTC with them. The other major exchanges are really quite fine. Coinbase is particularly trust worth in my opinion. The key is to not keep bitcoin at an exchange for any period of time. The second you buy it, transfer it to a wallet and if its a significant amount to a paper wallet or other offline storage.
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:25:14
Meh. I'm not sure that them not doing anything bad right now is a good enough argument for not worrying about them approaching network control. A bitcoin whose transactions can be censored by a just a few individuals or organizations is hardly an improvement from current systems. I appreciate your realism, but its a more health approach to think of solutions to discourage or deincentivize huge conglomerate mining pools.

Its never a bad thing to get bitcoin publicity. More users = better, more robust network plus placed to actually spend it = less hoarding.
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:59:22
Its essentially exactly the same, but you can just put one address out there and not be tracked. It really isn't a huge improvement.
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:25:40
When making a multi-sig address, you make a x of y, where  x is the amount needed to spend, and y is the total signers.

Yup. No need for a revolution, just make their job pointless with technology
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:51:56
First, the email backups are encrypted with your password. Second, there is no technical way to encrypt something with an always changing two factor authentication method. Think about it, how can you encrypt something with a code which changes every 5 seconds?

@_date: 2014-06-06 15:19:53
Kinda of technical, but what program are you gonna use to encrypt it? Truecrypt is dead now...
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:47:39
Looks really cool! I'm surprised we haven't had something like this already. There is no reason you should have to trust a service (like GreenAddress.it) to do two factor authentication.
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:14:42
And they were right. Yes you made some money (well at least on paper), but it is not a good investment for a significant portion of your money. It is an extremely volatile asset. Yes me (and presumably you) think it is the most important technology created in the last several decades, but it is is not a good investment. Follow bitcoin, maybe put some "fun money" into it that you really can afford to loose without damaging your present and future financial security, but don't thing its a good investment. No one knows what will happen to any investment, and Bitcoin is one whitch is even more unknown. You might just as likely make a post a year from now crying about how much money you lost as bragging about a new car you bought with your profits. 
Edit: But hey, maybe I've just been indoctrinated by the current system.

Bitcoin is a currency, you can buy units of it through an exchange. Just google "how to buy bitcoins in (your country)". Considering you think bitcoins have dividends, maybe you shouldn't invest in them because you don't understand it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:59:44
I think it essentially can already function as this. You don't have to download the whole blockchain to be a node. You can download just the transactions involving you, or none at all. This is what wallets like MultiBit do. As far as I understand it, it works like Bittorrent. So you share whatever you have downloaded so far. It is totally possible to change the software to not download the whole chain. It is better if more people have the whole chain so that individual parts of it can be distributed faster though.

It is a ridiculous question (not being snarky, but playfull)! The whole point of bitcoin is that you can send it to people. There is just a little send payment button on coinbase and you paste in your Electrum wallet's public address and how much you want to send, just like you were paying a merchant but instead your sending it to yourself. Coinbase is fairly safe, they go through a lot of measures to protect your coins. Non-Web wallets will always be more secure though.

Yes but this argument is still interesting because it shows that bitcoin could move to a faster block time and not sacrifice security. But overall it doesn't matter. The only difference it would make is in retail stores, and there your not gonna wait 2.5 minutes or 10 minutes just sitting waiting for a block to incorporate your transaction. Blocks would have to be made in under a minute realistically for it to be practical to wait in a retail store for a confirmation.

I look at alt coins sorta like beta testing. They can show what can be done to change or improve bitcoin. It is very unlikely any of them will really get anywhere close to bitcoin. As one person on here put it, there are TONS of reason for people to move from traditional currencies to Bitcoin, and almost NO reasons for people to move from bitcoin to another cyrpto. Think about, if an alt currency really shows some great improvement, it could just be implemented into bitcoin. It can be updated, after-all. In fact, its technically still a beta.
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:56:02

What you're doing is called Dollar-Cost-Averaging, and it's great and has been used by smart investors for decades! It means that your always buying more when its low and less when its high. I think that bitcoin does have some scallibility issues though. Like if people started using bitcoin for every transaction tomorrow, bitcoin could not keep up. We are already running into issues (google block size limit) with too many transactions for miners to process without an update to the system. Most people on this subreddit, including me, are hopeful for the future of bitcoin. However, bitcoin is not perfect. There are some serious issues we need to get through for it to be the currency of the world.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:15:48
By full node I don't mean minning. I just mean running bitcoin-qt and downloading the entire block-chain and relaying transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:59:29
I don't really think Satoshi made bitcoin to eliminate debt. You have to understand how usefull debt is. If you want to start a buissness, for example, you probably don't have the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to start it. You might be pretty sure that it would be profitable enough to pay for its initial costs, but without debt you would never be able to start it. If your talking about credit card debt, than yes I agree that this is a potential thing that bitcoin could eliminate. But debt when it comes to business or property is kinda great for everyone involved a lot of the time.

My email:
I find it very odd that you do not accept bitcoin. I have seen your note saying that you will not accept a currency not backed by a government, but you should consider your options. There are services out there, such as Bitpay, which will (for a small 1% fee) immediately convert bitcoin payments into whatever currency you want and deposit it into your bank account. To not implement something this easy is ridiculous. You can be getting huge amounts of donations, with no risk of charge-back or fluctuation in price. One of the biggest areas that these "cryptocurrencies" have been used is in donations. Its easy and even downright fun to spend bitcoin, and I for one would surely donate if you accepted it. It can quite literally be a few lines of code. As the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers. I don't mean to insult Wikipedia in this way, but merely to point out the potential hypocrisy in so constantly requesting donations to users of Wikipedia but not accepting a potential huge stream of revenue. The staff at wikipedia's opinion on Bitcoin really should not be relevant. The people who would donate with Bitcoin are people whom WOULD NOT donate otherwise. Sorry for the strongly worded email, but I LOVE wikipedia and think that this is a great step in the right direction for it
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:27:41
What account?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:03:36
I still think it is a potentially very popular service. Just like Bitpay allows merchants to accept Bitcoin but still ultimately receive USD, this service would allow merchants  to accept x-coin but still ultimately receive Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:54:00
I guess. But I don't think people really ever buy things in alt-coins, they are almost entirely speculation. Bitcoin is the only one people actually use as a currency.

Here's what I don't get about Bitcoin alternatives. If someone has a idea on how to improve Bitcoin, instead of just immediately branching to a new currency, why not submit a change to the open source project? Bitcoin is open source and can and has been updated. If you truly think that you have a way to unarguably improve Bitcoin, than try to get it put into the bitcoin protocol instead of making the 15th thousandth other currency. I suppose the developers are pretty reluctant to do any significant changes though... but still one should consider integrating their improvement into bitcoin before forking it.

Well in about 50 years, private keys could theoretically began to be broken. By than bitcoin (if it still exists) will have moven to a more secure algorithm and this would be no issue for active users. So people could potentially start cracking these older lost addresses and return them to the economy. But having lost coins is not necessarily bad (besides for the people who lost them!) because bitcoin can be split into such small units. And if these units become too big, it would be very easy to allow them to be split further.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:06:25
Just because a transaction is not on the blockchain doesn't mean you can't detect a double spend attempt. After you get paid, you can check if they're are any unconfirmed transactions (as well as confirmed ones like your normally do) that involve the spending of those same coins. So if everyone did this, the second+ person being payed those coins would detect it assuming the transaction got its way to them. But yes having to wait 10 minutes for any sort of official confirmation is an often discussed aspect of bitcoin, and has caused the creation of several alt-coins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:15:49
Here's what I would do if I were you. Get a coinbase account and buy whatever the total amount you want for all of them. Make two paper wallets for each of them, one to give to them on Christmas and one to keep safe because they will probably loose it. Explain to them bitcoin and set them up a wallet. If they seem interested and if they don't just keep that second paper backup to give to them if it ever is worth a lot :).
