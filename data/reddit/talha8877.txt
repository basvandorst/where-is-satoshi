He has 10.000 bots that make 0.01 at every trade. They make about 100 trades a day. 365 days a year. Go figure.

A small vocal minority that is less than %5? 
If you can't prove this you are a self declared moron. Hadi.

Better safe than sorry. 50 EMA is a tough average to break downwards and from now on upwards.

Turk here. What this guy says is completely misleading. Erdogan couldn't get over %51 in the last elections despite his cronies own all the media in Turkey, The guy practically have infinite propaganda resources in his hand but actually lost voters in Istanbul. 
Today all the polls show that his approval is down around %40. If he doesn't rig the elections he can't win. His time is up. And HE IS THE ONLY MAN RESPONSIBLE for TURKEY'S ECONOMIC DOWNFALL. Turkish Central Bank can't give autonomous decisions without asking this high school graduate dickhead.

You don't know anything. Erdogan LOVES Israel. Israel was dying to become a member of OECD. It was Erdogan who got them in OECD despite all the protest from EU nations because of human rights issues of Israel.

He's like a character from Silicon Valley Tv show.

Bitcoin is losing value faster than Lira at the moment. They should wait until 3400 usd.

Blockchain is so useful it can even help you to fulfill your fetish.

The moment you assumed out of your ass that I hate Islam you proved that you are a moron. So its not a curse it a reality that you need to accept. 
I'm not even from istanbul. 
Erdoğan knew about the coup and let it happen. He didn't stop it. He built it.

Also anybody who thinks BTC price going up IS the way to make money is extremely dumb. 
This market is run by couple whales and algorithms. And algos never think "hmm if I hold btc for 5 years I can get a lambo." 
They will make money by pumping and dumping in an endless cycle.

That will never happen. That train was for people when BTC was in hundreds. 
From this point on there's no multiple fold gains. U can buy at 8000 sell at 20.000 at most if you are really lucky. It's millonaire's game, they will have big returns but not you small investor.

Bitcoin is like your obsessed girlfriend. Doesn't want you to pay attention to anything else.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:08:31
Allright, kucoin is a good addition.
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:33:48
this is good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:59:11
Great suggestion, added to the list.

He actually sold his Lambo in January and bought bitcoin.

It is actually true. Whatever you give to charity is an investment, as it returns in blessings. Your traditional investment can bring you all the money that you want but not peace. 
So put %10 in charity and see.
