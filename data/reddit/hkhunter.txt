I think r/bitcoin is a bad place for any reasonable discussion. There are so many people here who have such a huge emotional investment that they are one-eyed. I don't say this in direct relation to Mt Gox but in regard to every topic.
However, if you can't see that exchanges like Mt Gox going down is bad for Bitcoin then you need help. It is things like this that stop people from buying in the first place. Most people don't have the time or passion to do the necessary research. Why should they when they can operate in regulated markets where they have some protection by institutions that do the research for them.
Bitcoin fan here but the one-eyed BS in this forum constantly winds me up. Kids harping on about their ideologies.

I tried to buy last year but with little luck. Based in Hong Kong and i don't trust any of the exchanges. Tried localbitcoin and noone would answer my messages and offers to buy at the listed prices.

ITT: People thinking that Silkroad was mainly used by people trying to get their acid tabs for a little weekend fun.
Silkroad was mainly used by really shitty people, the sort who would happily cut crazy shit like fentanyl into people's fixes. The site may have tried to clean itself up a bit (not harming people thing) but for a long time guns, ingredients for bombs etc were listed. You can't just create a black market and not be made example of. The sentence is way too much but this was a person who knew exactly what was happening on this site.

You won't get much concession from this guy. His history is all r/Bitcoin and he has a huge emotional investment. Most of his posts are either sarcastic or condescending. Not worth the argument when it will hardly be a balanced view.

I think peope were taking offence by the fact that you're handing out financial advise when you have a pretty miserable track record with investments.
Posts like these deserve to be on the conspiracy sub (all the talk of shills). Sure, shills exist, but not every anti-bitcoin comment is a shill. You may be emotionally invested but others see it with a critical eye. This is a good thing for bitcoin... it needs to be stress tested if it's ever going to go truly mainstream.

Why are people gambling with dice sites? Are these sites specifically aimed at BTC? I'll never understand people who gamble on fixed odds / stats like casinos or dice. When you gamble on sport the challenge is getting odds better then the actual value of the bet, which is impossible in stats. Gambling is gambling and you might win/lose, but with sports or something you have an opinion and get some satisfaction if you win. I just don't get the same happiness from stats... it just something that changes. Each to their own I guess. But take it from me, anything which is a click of a button and resolved in a matter of seconds in normally bad news. May as well go to the casino and get some free drinks.
Edit - Sorry for your loss. It sounds like you know that making an all or nothing bet was a bad move. I too have learnt similar lessons so very much appreciate your mindset.

I reckon he'll be ok - In July 2013, Voorhees sold SatoshiDice to an anonymous investor for 126,315 bitcoins, valued at $11.5M （$99.3M as of Jan 30 2014), and described as the "first big Bitcoin acquisition

Yes, you'd be pretty foolish to put any substantial percentage of savings at 40.

Well, in Hong Kong there isn't any capital gains tax, which is nice.

Right, so why are you buying then? Lottery tickets aren't a good investment... especially when you're in high school trying to save money! Each to their own though.

Stalked is perhaps a bit strong... It took all of 10 secs to confirm that you're a minor. From one gambler to another, try and use the little money you have now to help you take steps forward to where you want to be. Once you're there (or a bit closer) you'll have excess money that you can use for risky gambles if you still desire (but you probably won't). By all means have small holdings for fun in case it really takes off but otherwise be frugal. Good luck!

Stupid is as stupid does. Welcome to the circle-jerk where people who don't understand basic rules of investment give advice to others who have no idea about financial markets. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:07:23


Isn't that what a forum is? A place for discussion, for both sides to be represented, otherwise it's just an echo-chamber? If you only allow holders to post then you only get the long view...

You get to say you own some internet wizard money. Most transactions are expensive and you can't buy much stuff with it. It tends to have aggressive spikes up and down and no-one really knows what it's going to do next or if they're on Apollo 1 or Apollo 11.

That's because most investors in BTC are teenagers, who don't understand the rules of investment.

Dude, just close the thread. You have absolutely no understanding of what you're talking about and you're attacking others. Just admit that you have no idea and typed this out because it seemed like it makes sense at the time, just in case others are foolish enough to think you have a point.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:07:13
I don't think i've ever seen a short that wasn't leveraged, they could make 100 times their investment with even small swings. Trying not to be a twat but you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Institutions very rarely hold positions in anything, they trade volatility.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:54:33
If you want to talk about Venrock then they won't be doing any trading at all, just investing in companies enabled by blockchain technology.

I did it knowing absolutely nothing a month ago. Nano S was really straight forward. Used Gemini as the exchange. Thought it would be more complicated but pretty self explanatory in the end.

You have this weird hard-on for financial doom. We won't ever get to this point... govts / central banks won't allow it... why do you think QE happened? And if it did happen then the structure of society would go with it, and somebody bigger / badder than you would take your Bitcoin!

Ahhhhhh, why is everyone so one-eyed? Reddit is not the centre of the universe. Yes, some material from Reddit does get reproduced in the news. But thinking that a financial correspondent gives a damn what is happening on reddit is just silly. Reddit is largely full of hipsters who want nothing to do with finance - which is why there is so many ridiculous posts in this forum.
As a reminder, I am pro-bitcoin. But do yourselves a favour and speak to a friend or family member who is familiar with how financial markets work and how they are effected.

People don't read reddit for reliable news about financial products!

Thanks for all the responses - I do also have a UK bank account if it makes things much easier?
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:39:28
Op is pretending that the information posted in this subreddit alone has the power to crash Bitcoin, which frankly is very silly.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:19:29
Market manipulation does not produce crashes, but it can produce small swings. Manipulation unsubstantiated by real news is corrected by the market very quickly. And posting in all the bit coins forum everywhere may have a very small effect. But the difference is that most other forums will likely have more members who understand the markets and don't react to bs positive or negative rumors. There is ALWAYS someone out there who knows more than you do.
@_date: 2013-06-13 03:06:21
Do you mind clarifying this answer? How long would it take to break even if you bought this? I know very little about this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:46:52
Because Reddit doesn't have the power to effect the price!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:04:43
Would you not prefer educated discussion?
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:30:45
Fan of bitcoin here but it worries me how much blind faith people have (not related to China or recent news). If people are investing sums of money which are important to them then this needs to be treated as a high-risk investment. There is a chance that Bitcoin could end up at 0 (a lot more chance than your typical large company). All i'm saying is buy and hold if you want to, but only go into this blind if you can afford to lose your investment (as with all high-risk investments). Just trying to balance out the circle-jerk. I would love Bitcoin to prosper and thrive but people need to understand the risks. All i'm saying is ask yourself "what if i lost my entire investment tomorrow - will my life significantly change for the worse". If / When the the answer to this is no then you're all good. Rant over. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:45:01


But it's comments like this that contribute to the problem. Who are you to say bitcoin WILL go up??? There are no certainties in life and especially not in financial markets. In good financial forums you find people presenting educated arguments as to why something may or may not go up in the future. Not surefire statements that make people look like they are just holiding a finger in the air. Statements like this could lose a lot of kids a lot of money as most don't know any better than trusting a random person on Reddit

Any financial correspondent would likely lose their job for quoting Reddit. Local news looking for interesting stories is not Bloomberg or Reuters.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:35:17
PR companies want to get Joe Public to buy their clients' products. Joe Public aren't the ones behind the huge market swings in bitcoin, and those with enough funds to make the market move do not get their news from Reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:17:00
I am not saying the value WILL go to 0. But this is not a typical investment in a company with assets etc. Bitcoin IS a zero sum game. The current value of bitcoin is derived from speculation that it MAY be a potential future mainstream form of payment. If this doesn't happen (it either gets widely accepted or it flops entirely) then bitcoin will be worth nothing. The value is in the speculation, if it is made clear that bitcoin can not be used in the mainstream then it will have no value, if not zero then pretty close to.
Again, I like bitcoin, would love to see it succeed and i'm trying to buy in for a modest investment. But it is really scary how many people believe that this is a dead cert to make them their millions, of which a majority do not have any experience with financial products or the markets. I am not an expert by any means but i do have plenty of experience working with risk and can identify a dangerous circle jerk when I see one, it's not too dissimilar to some of the forums on the oil stocks. There are some people who read these threads who lap up every word of positive news and ignore anything negative. This is not a way to successfully manage your finances. Understand risk and understand how to manage an investment fund. Don't be ruled by your emotions unless the sum of money is expendable. Good luck everyone.
