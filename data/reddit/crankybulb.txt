You’re gonna have to spend at least 5 minutes researching for yourself - nobody in their right mind is gonna take the time to write out all the basics for you when they are so readily available already.

It’s only Americans that think Wall Street are manipulating everything because that’s what they do in America. 
I don’t think a lot of Americans on this sub realise exactly how much money is in Asia.

Buying drugs. But that’s nothing to do with it at this moment in time. Only a tiny % of bitcoins in circulation are used for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:06:56
If it falls to 10k I’m not worried at all, I’m still up 3x what I got in at. 
You’re right though, I’m not gonna touch my investment for at least a year.

Come on bro just get your dad to look at the numbers. Anyone holding has made 40% return over the last 7 days. 
40% is an absolutely enormous profit in a week for an investment. It’s incredible. That’s without losing a single penny. How can you need any more than that?
Plus you don’t actually have to do anything apart from sit back and watch the money grow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:03:46
Don’t listen to the terrible advice from some here. If you try to trade it you will lose your money.
Bitcoin has just gone up like 20% in the last 24 hours, if you’re trying to make more profit than that your greed will be your downfall. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:43:00
Bitcoin aside - clearly, keeping those things illegal doesn’t work at all. Time for a new angle.

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:06:09
Well that is only assuming that you want the asset to crash and then regain the value in full (plus more?) obviously everyone wants this.
The real question is what happens if it crashes and doesn’t regain any value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:13
That’s why you only put a small portion of your btc into it. Even if your btc goes to zero (which it might, let’s be real) you will have a house to live in and a hundred grand or more in value in it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:17:05
Bitcoin isn’t a stock or a profit driven company. This is like asking someone to do some PR for gold when the price dips.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:31:00
If you think the underground markets are a large portion of what bitcoin is used for you need to do more research.

I think people who are constantly saying things like “falling knife” and “dead cat bounce” are just trying to sound clever by using terms traders use. None of you actually have any evidence, theory or useful information to present.

People on here are so retarded. They spend weeks chirping on about how we all need to “wait for the dip” and then as soon as the price does dip a little I guarantee it’s the same people posting “is bitcoin crashing?” 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:32
There is a lot of instances of people losing fair sums of money due to sheer carelessness. I don’t know about you guys but I would be furious if I lost $500 or more simply due to not having the seed written down. I can’t believe people are this careless with this amount of money.

You probably should sell it. If you can't afford to lose 50 dollars you can't afford to invest in bitcoin. It's far too risky.

Time after time after time people post about “waiting for dips” as if it’s some strategic investment move, I’d be willing to bet anyone that is scared to buy in when price is rising would also be too scared to buy in when the price is dropping. Btc just keeps on going up and people keep on missing opportunity. It’s the way it always has been and always will be. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:33:32
With new and innovative technology it doesn’t necessarily need to follow a pattern in terms of its growth. That’s why it’s so hard to follow and why anyone with a brain invests by dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:50:34
1. 1% or so (only so small because I own property and that is most of my worth)
2. That’s silly just buy some when you can afford it. 
Think this way, last week it was around 7k and people were waiting for dips, it’s now 8.2k and the next dip (if it happens) will likely only go back as far as 7ish thousand. Anyone that waits for this dip, assuming it happens, could’ve just got in last week for the same price.
3. No.

Not worth it in my opinion. If you consider there’s a possibility bitcoin could double in price in that time. You could just double your investment in the time it takes to break even.

@_date: 2017-11-26 00:20:34
Judging by your questions so far I would say you need to do more research before seriously getting into bitcoin. 5 minutes on this sub will answer those questions.

Take literally 2 seconds to read this sub and you’ll have the answers to all of those questions.

2. Still nobody knows the answer.

What’s the point in that? You’re just delaying investing at an already late stage. Unless you’re a professional trader you won’t be able to read the btc market anyway. Even then it’d be hard. Just dollar cost average or go all in.

Come on bro just stop asking questions like this - what do you expect, someone to say to you that it's going to 5000 on November 21st, then down 2000 on December 8th?
You aren't gonna get the answers you're looking for and you know it. It's just a waste of time and a waste of a post.
There are no experts in BTC - anyone who claims to know what is going to happen is bullshitting you.

I see. So the conclusion is: bitcoin might go up and down a bit. Insightful. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:20:45
I reckon the vast majority of people here holding have less than 1 btc and also a large portion of those have less than 0.5 btc.
Hoping that anything less than 10btc might pay for a retirement is extremely optimistic imo but one can always dream right?
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:45:19

What qualifications do you have to make that prediction with such certainty?
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:54:55
What do you mean “over-priced”? Bitcoin can’t be assigned a specific cost. It’s not a car.

This sounds more like bullshit than anything else I’ve read on reddit today. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:31:25
Bought $2000 at the same time as you. Don't sweat it. This always happens when I buy things. My plan was to wait for 2 years before reconsidering so that's what I'll do regardless of where it goes over the next 24 months. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:32:13
If you can do afford to, your next steps should be 
1. Learning how to buy bitcoin cheaper than that.
2. Buying more, if you want to invest. That $20 will still be worth fuck all if bitcoin goes to $100k/btc.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:21:19
Same mate lost 20% on my buy in - less than a week so far haha. 
Oh well I better get off this sub for 2 years.

Wish I understood.. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:15:47
Money only has a value relative to how much you have, when it comes to investing. $1300 really isn't very much money at all (unless you're unlucky enough to be on really hard times.)
That being said, be careful and don't invest more than you would be comfortable losing completely. Are you working currently? If so. Just buy $100 worth each time you get paid. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:57:28

@_date: 2017-10-21 10:40:41
This guy is correct, it doesn't sound like you understand how investing works; nor does it sound like you've even spent 5 minutes researching. 
Also asking people on Reddit what you should do with your finances is not smart.

I thought this too, have an upvoot. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:04:09
Double or triple what you make currently make would be a good start for some investment cash on the side.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:23:16
I feel extra pressure was added to the drop by the fact I bought in 24 hours ago. This is probably what initiated the process.

Hmm interesting. I think you could be correct. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:31:42
Very similar thoughts - basically whenever I take a punt on investing in something, it doesn't work out. I think the fact that I have bought some bitcoin will be the catalyst of a steep unending decline.
Let's hope not though, for real. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:03:53
I see you use a similar investing style to me. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:17:36
I'm good bro I'm actually on holiday. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:55:34

30th time this has been posted. Yawn. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:08:34
Well that all depends on whether or not you can afford to lose $50 mate. Nobody on the internet can answer that for you. 
If you are scared to lose 50 dollars, then the answer is absolutely not, you should not buy it. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:01:39
America isn't great either in comparison.
-Outrageously unaffordable healthcare system whilst one of the richest countries on the planet.
-Outrageously unaffordable further education system (college)
-Something like 50 million adult Americans can't read.
-Huge ongoing drug problems, legal and illegal.
No country is anywhere near perfect. Every place has issues.

If it was only $200 it's hardly worth investing, even if bitcoin quadruples in value to 20k a coin over the next 5 years you've only got $800 which is $600 profit in 5 years. It's like 2 bucks a week. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:55:54
Unless you’re buying like 10 bitcoins or more at a time what’s the point, that’s hardly a big price difference to take such a risk on. It might never ever go back under 9.2k now.

Every single time bitcoin retracts a bit and then goes up again everyone races to reddit to shout “dead cat bounce” in an attempt to look clever. Seen it literally thousands of times now.

How will you know the difference between the beginning of a small dip and a major crash? What if you miss a major spike? What if it goes up a little, you sell, then it goes up fucking loads and you can't afford to buy back in?
