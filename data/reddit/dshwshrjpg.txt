Nice! If you have any other questions I'll be happy to help you! :)

I'm really happy with bitonic.nl, but you'll have to send SEPA transfers I guess.. Also check bl3p, it's made by the same company.

Also, the exchange you select doesn't really matter - it's more for your own administration. The exchange I use is not listed so I use Bitstamp as a random one.

Easy indeed. An then put that bonus in to bitcoin.

The price is the price of a whole bitcoin (at this moment $14851 for example). Then, in the next field, enter the amount of bitcoin you bought (0.14482 for example). Then save and it's fixed! Was confusing for me too the first time :)

This guide is great. As said, send the BTC to [Bitonic]( They are the best for this in the Netherlands! You can verify them through googling and their Ideal (Dutch online payment system for the people who never heard of it).

Hahaha this is golden :')

Hey, since you're in the Netherlands I'd like to advice you [bitonic.nl]( They transfer straight to your IBAN bank account. No hassle and only set up once. But I'd advice you to wait for a few days before cashing. If you need more help (in Dutch for example) I sent you a PM.

 Which country are you from? If you're from the Netherlands, you can also use Bitonic using iDeal payments.

Same.. But we'll get there!

Haha Nice! I finally got to 0.333 bitcoin as well yesterday! Also a student, but yeah, see you on the moon :p

It's a cliche, but I believe in the technology
