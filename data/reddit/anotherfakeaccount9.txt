You may not have enough including the transaction fee.

Does Coinbase say that your transaction is pending? I know for me they sometimes take almost a week to deposit my coins into my Coinbase wallet. I have only ever purchased on Coinbase and at an ATM near me.

I'll definitely look into that! Thanks!

They won't let you spend from your USD wallet until it is not pending. You can always try to buy just $1-3 worth directly from your bank instead of into the USD wallet. 
I've used those small purchases to show people how it works because it shows in the wallet instantly most of the time.

This would count as actual police work wouldn't it? Undercover fishing but on reddit instead of in a bar or seedy joint.

That does sound awful! I've had my Coinbase account for at least a year, probably two, so I don't remember any of the hassle. Plus, all I do is buy and hodl so my experience isn't a full one. 
I might look into others if I start to buy/sell more coins. I'm lazy though so I really like having an app. Do a lot of buying and stuff on the throne.

I use them consistently just to make small purchases because they have an iOS app. It's easy and I've never had a problem. What's happening with them now?

I've wondered the same thing but each time I try to look into mining it seems like everything is geared toward big operations and making as much money as possible. 
I'd love to b able to plug something in and let it run.
