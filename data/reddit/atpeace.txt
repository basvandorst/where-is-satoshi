The question surely is who puts 200k into an exchange that is fucking shit?

Yes. God awful, I imagine it has been down at the most important times over thew last week. Guess the volume they have is from fault tolerant user bots raking it in from users who have the endless please refresh to find out if your order was placed or not. Or api unavailable or just site simply not there

Fair enough. Sry to press you. The market is partially volatile right now, hitting the same highest ever for the 3rd time.

And you're not at all sounding like a salesman

TBH then why are you holding bitcoin? x7 value in 6 month and being patient about it. Meh. Probably should warn a new investor of the falls that can happen in these times.

Personally I don't think gambling is something someone who is 16 should do. If you research gambling for more than weeks then ok. Its your money.
