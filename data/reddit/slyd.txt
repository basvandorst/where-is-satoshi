It doesn't have a "default logger" lol
Never lost any crypto. Traded over $1M total. Mined with 3 farms, 1300ish gpus split into 8 card rigs.
All windows 10. I don't even use an AV. 
No keylogger.

"allow" lol
As if governments can control what software people choose to spend their time developing. They going to have someone standing over your shoulder every time you fire up your dev platforms?
Tell me a story! What happened to the price of alcohol during prohibition?
Tell me another story! How much money is currently "tied up" in bitcoin? 
Final story! If you had even $2M in bitcoin and government disallowed it, would you stop using it because you're not allowed?

Bitcoin is a store of value, compliance itself is irrelevant. Compliance applies to exchanges.
Stretching your point to absurdity:
Original rare Pokémon trading cards will fail, because they are not compliant with laws and regulations.
Nuh-uh, they're just another thing with value that can be traded.

Pffft what a total load of nonsense. That doesn't even warrant a proper reply.
