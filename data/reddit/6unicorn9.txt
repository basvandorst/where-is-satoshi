Not implying you use those banks but anybody who does has no room to complain with the options available. 
More online banks than ever are popping up with no fees. I’m not saying that fees aren’t an issue but I have an extremely hard time imagining fees at every single bank. 
But who knows. I don’t disagree that fees are common.

Completely false

Yeah but it’s not as bad as you’re making it sound. BTC is the perfect thing for a thief to buy if your card is stolen card so of course your bank is going to be careful about it to protect your money.
They’re not doing it because they’re afraid of BTC itself lmao

Some major banks do it on some accounts. I’ve never had trouble finding a bank that doesn’t have monthly fees
This has been a thing for dozens of years. Doesn’t mean all banks are going to do it. Too much competition

You're a fool if you're using those huge banks. There's no reason too. There's tens of thousands of smaller banks and credit unions that don't offer fees.

Yeah I think you’re into conspiracies a little too much for me. Hit me up when all banks flip their switch and turn on fees and prove me wrong. 
Banks can’t get away with that because people will just take their cash out. Nobody is forced to use a bank.

And each time they said it was dead it was lower than it is now. What’s your point?
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:57:34
Yep. Those are lines.

You must be new to this

So many that are serious right now that I didn’t realize it. Haha
