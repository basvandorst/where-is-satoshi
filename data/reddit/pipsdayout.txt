The way they handled the situation was completely unethical.  I received no notice while others were notified as early as this morning.

I feel you.  The infrastructure surrounding bitcoin is revealing itself to be a house of cards.  All the sudden I'm happy with my local bank, Amex, mutual funds, and the good old USD...

I was actually one of those forced to buy at inflated prices during the Bitfloor fiasco (had cash there waiting for another dip).  Worked out in my favor.  For now...

A space chicken is kinda funny, I guess.

They continue to improve, and so I'll continue to support them.  Their interface is simple and clean and it's founders seemed committed for the long haul, and have gone out of their way to address the issues I've raised.  Bitcoin needs more companies like this...

Very easy.  A billion dollar market cap is huge and small all at the same time.

Devoured this.  Thanks for doing the brainwork, sir.

No, they're helping it find its true market value.

Not much you can do with that, but now you have more.

I'm holding my bitcoins, no worries there, but dealing with them on a daily basis is a pain in the ass.  It's all fun though, any technology needs beta testers...

Please heed this advice.  Any exchange could be shut down at a moment's notice.

A bull trap, or maybe not.  As long as you're willing to lose it all, congrats!  I bought most of my coins at $27, so it was psychologically easier for me to hold.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:05:59
The ethical way to have handled this would be to have simply shut down the exchange.  If all funds were safe (let's hope!), everybody would be in a position of their own choosing. Instead, a large group of people were unfairly forced into panic, while others could calmly buy BTC at market price and exit.

So you think the return to the mean will be a continuation of the exponential increase we saw before the Cyprus bounce?

I agree slow, steady growth would be best, but a big price point would set plenty of smart minds in motion...

I feel great when I spend it, like I'm part of a movement and not just throwing money away.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:15:54
No, I'm just happy in a pragmatic sort of way that my local bank treats me well.  It's not like startups have nothing to learn from what's already worked.
