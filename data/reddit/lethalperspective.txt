Wait for KnC to ship their first products. they will then stop shipping for 3 months while they work on their 2nd generation, and by then you will have a better idea if it's worth investing in ASIC miners. There's also Cointerra. BFL is a joke, I highly do not recommend purchasing from them because they are extremely unprofessional and have no issue blatantly lying.

The beauty of these types of currencies is that if one person hoards all the wealth, the value of that currency will deteriorate, and another one will take its place. Our enemy is still the governments propaganda machine. They are casting as much bad light on this as they can, because it doesn't fit the mold of the corrupt world they prefer. They want to own it in some way, until they can enjoy it as we do. I would ask why they need to have anything to do with this revolutionary p2p money system? With that said, mining is here to stay. It should, by the logic I've stated above, maintain profitability, assuming the governments don't ruin this. If I'm wrong, I'd love to hear your opinion why.

Horribly written article with the typical tyrannical vibes that come from Bitcoin market speculators. You might be right, but with the arrogant tone you use in which you come off as one who is dictating reality, rather than merely speculating like the rest of us, you may as well have just wrote "I am God" and left it at that. Ironically, OP is the very thing that prevents Bitcoin from progressing forward. Bitcoin will not succeed because a random person on Reddit declared it so with horrible grammar, which contributes to the lack of evidence to support the theory that you have any authority to talk about the future prospects of it.
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:33:30
Thing with me is I don't care. Besides, my latest comment is an evolution upon my earlier sentiment. It is not "diametrically opposed," except in your mind.
@_date: 2013-07-29 16:56:34
Things like this can be prevented by having the software question your calculations if they seem disproportionate. 
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:48:32
Because it seems like it can't work, and there is no central support system if one has an issue. There is also no legal system. See, there is a reason the world loves America (or used to), and that is because everything is integrated. With that said, there is also a reason a lot of people hate Obama, because he is trying to dismantle the perfect system, and grinning the whole way, knowing that he is effectively playing on the ignorant masses who believe America is at fault for their failures in life. Pretty much, that's like saying Bitcoin is the fault for my failures in life. Neither would be true in context, but this day we live in, everything is taken out of context and they pass it off as political parties, when really they are one malicious party that are worse than terrorists. Bitcoin may never be what it's cheerleaders claim, but it's a good speculative bet, because right now in today's world, it does seem to be useful in solving some minor wealth transfer issues. If you find no value in that, then you are rich, or extremely dumb. Either way, I suggest you kindly suck a dick and fuck the fuck off.
@_date: 2013-05-24 06:45:19

@_date: 2013-06-05 09:06:34
wow you've got to have a lot of time on your hands and disposable income to use bitcoin. no wonder it's not catching on! people don't have time for all this security shit. it's easier to just play politics and deal with fiat. old recipe but a good one. until bitcoin can be secure without the need for one to buy a new computer to store them on and a safety box, and all that hassle, no one is going to bother and they will get robbed/demotivated to use bitcoins. and what about the security involved risk of holding passthru shares where you cannot store them on paper wallets? see no one has time for this shit and crackers are exploiting the shit out of it and more will come after they are done milking bitcoin to death, because i'm sure plenty of these crackers are letting bitcoin seem secure right now so that they don't drive the price down too much. they know that if they hadn't hacked mother fuckers, then bitcoin would be in the $1000's right now. for all we know, OP is a bitcoin thief. you want to do us a favor really?? try killing yourself! oh and, in before Safe Paper Wallet is exploited some how and the owner vanishes. because all this post is, is an inconspicuous advertisement with a style to make you feel dumb so that you trust OP more some how, if that were even possible. another thing; why are we reverting back to paper? might as well use dollars again.
@_date: 2013-06-16 05:51:22
The whole unprecedented senseless blaming of ASICMiner is getting out of hand. They could have chosen to solo mine and not give away any of the profits to share holders. Then what would you do?
@_date: 2013-08-14 20:47:24
the only thing high risk is the U.S. government under Obama. it is not just high risk to the U.S. people, it is high risk to the entire planet. coinbase is a victim of U.S. government tyranny, so don't blame them, blame Obama.

it's for dumb people. in the end all these systems help new idiots adopt it. since i don't have a business, i don't care, but if i did i'd be afraid of the government so i would use bitpay or someone who is following government regulations better than mt.gox. but like i said, i don't give a shit really because i have no business, so therefore whatever helps bitcoin succeed and thus go higher in value, is what i care about, and bitpay helps adoption of bitcoin so that is beneficial in my case. whatever it takes to see bitcoin hit $10,000+

Here's the real reason why, the Bitcoin market is real. It's supported by the black market demand and there is a lot of powerful influential forces behind it. Gold and silver and useless in the modern economy. Bitcoin will never die because it's run by the world wide underground mafia that owns the united states.

How will these people get on their own two feet, as you said? A lot of homeless people have severe problems that cause them to fit in a narrow category where they are not entitled to welfare, but also are not well enough to support themselves. I doubt anyone would choose to live that life.

@_date: 2013-07-12 04:32:32
It's more risky not to take the risk. The financial meltdown/crash has not even begun yet. DJIA just had another huge up day based on more fake printed dollars. When the old broken system collapses, imagine the rush to Bitcoin. Yes, Bitcoin's price is inherently volatile, but I have no problem with that. If you think volatility is somehow bad, stay away. All choices in life are risky, you cannot avoid it. In my opinion as long as the risk makes sense, in the case of Bitcoin, after weight all my options, it's more risky not to take a risk with it. The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is, it goes up on the underlying fundamentals, more so than the perceived speculation aspect. It's really not as volatile as people make it out to be, in other words.

This is how investments work. investors get bored, questions that go unanswered which also adds to the lack of excitement = price drop, until trust is regained, when more excitement is created. This works both ways, companies being bored with their shareholders and they fuck them, rather than just going on with business doing things right, which would create long term stability. We'll see how this turns out.

I like your 3rd point. It would be great if such a service would come about for them mainstream, and also that the mainstream would typically be known to have some sort of Bitcoin limitations on their person, so that thieves would be deterred by the knowledge they cannot get much BTC out of someone. Not sure how that would exactly work though.

I can't convince you, because it's more or less a stupid currency which is basically the byproduct of a corrupt government/economy. I saw this written somewhere a few days ago:

@_date: 2013-08-14 16:49:03
Bitcoin is good for all the economies in the world. I actually believe there is only one economy so I will even say it is good for the world economy. Anyone who tries to regulate or inhibit it, is simply the same force that fucked up freedom in the United States. First they will use propaganda on the ignorant public to twist facts about whatever they need to twist facts on, then they will fuck up the system. They've done it before and I'm sure they plan to do it again. Even most of you who think you are Bitcoiners will fall prey to their agenda. One way or another, they will get you to go along with their plan. Security and education is the thing that will help most, because I suspect in the near future the government is going to lose this war against Bitcoin, so they will begin hiring hackers to exploit cracks in whatever is vulnerable and give as much bad press as possible so the public will nod in agreement with each other saying Bitcoin is an evil unreliable piece of shit that no one should waste time on, unless you're doing something illegal. They're already trying to say it's a ponzi scheme. Yes, they've been saying that from the beginning but their lies do evolve over time as more and more of the public takes in this new technology. As long as the public is divided on any subject, crooked politicians can exploit that to gain power.
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:14:16

Anyone who thinks this is a positive thing, is stupid. Bernanke admits in his letter that the inevitable onset of virtual currencies have been known about for a long time. Clearly, the next step is to attempt to strip these currencies of what makes them great. For all we know, a secret world government was behind Bitcoin anonymously, and they plan to use it only as an introduction to the concept. Are you ready to have the government monitor your money and tax it again? Well keep this in mind, Bitcoin was only so great because it allowed privacy. That's also the reason the United States was great. As I've been saying for a long time, private societies will never work, because gang mentality is too strong, and always prevails. Idiots.

70 million dollars? Kind of doubt that but yet you do make a valid point that they need to convert the incoming BTC into fiat. It's easy to imagine they've received 10k+ BTC which could be a huge contributor to the selling, certainly.

Niggers are complicated. They could be used for terrorism, unless they are constantly kept in check through mass media propaganda, and by hiring a gay half-black puppet to be president of the USA, which is just a country full of idiots who think they are free. Then we'll anonymously release this "bitcoin" thing into the wild and pin the law makers and politicians against the people while we laugh and continue to stack dividends from our corrupt scheme, only to end up regulating this technology in the future after we brainwash the cryptocurrency users just like we did to the americans. Life is good.

so go buy an Avalon or a BFL device and have a nice day. pretty simple, right? or are you just going to keep moaning to ASICMiner who has chosen to reward it's investors first, before playing Mother Teresa of Bitcoin? all I'm saying is, I really don't think they're in the charity business. suck it up, stop complaining. life sucks, we all know that. my plan is to wait until the price comes down, in the mean time I'm holding ASICM shares so that when the price comes down and the processor speeds go up, I'll be able to buy a decent amount of GH/s. you should employ the same strategy. I really doubt the complaining strategy will work, when people are eating these up as soon as they are available.

@_date: 2013-04-28 14:44:58
Bitcoin is already underground. In my opinion it spawned from the underground, just like corrupt mafias which are now at the forefront of every aspect of our little lives. Bitcoin is an awesome concept to take away control from central authorities, but I feel the community has failed and doomed itself by presenting unrealistic short-termed / hyped descriptions of what this truly is. and when I say community, I speak of the so-called free world, not the Bitcoin community exactly. The bitcoin community I have found is comprised of a small number of geniuses, and the rest are a bunch of fucking idiots who may be autistic which is a developmental disorder. In the end, I see Bitcoin dying, thus I have said so.

OP is a fag. You act like Bitcoin is some sort of blessing on earth. Truth is, it's really not. It's humanities pathetic attempt to deal with corruption on a level that goes beyond even this e-currency. If you made money with Bitcoins, good for you. However you're probably too stupid to realize it's value is now. In the future, it will be destroyed like everything else. America was also once hailed as a fail-proof system. Look at it now and judge for yourself. Bitcoin will also suffer the same fate. Sell while you can, and enjoy what's left of your stupid life.

Did Lavabit even attempt to warn users that this was on the way? I had an account there that I used sparingly, simply because I thought a day like this would come, and because their email system was dull/featureless. The management didn't seem too excited with progressing the site to higher levels. Otherwise, I was ready to use it as my primary email. Another superior service will take its place. In the meanwhile, no, I'm not donating shit to Lavabit. I don't feel like they are being 100% authentic. Feels more like they are playing the blame game. Oh, and this idiot doesn't even have a Bitcoin address? What a joke.

funny how you're a socialist. funny how I haven't mined a single fraction of a BTC yet I am calling out all you early miners as being nothing but whiny little cunts because your hardware is becoming obsolete. you're going to ruin Bitcoin just like you've ruined everything else on this planet, because one thing you will never learn is how to roll with the tide.

Any attacks on the free-market that is Bitcoin which has violated no laws other than the ones that have been made solely for the purpose of destroying freedom, should be met with resistance from the free people, unless the free people are to submit to tyranny and no longer be free to own their mind, soul and body.

The mods are retarded and don't know jack about running a community. They delete any opinions which they don't agree with. That is NOT how a chat room should function. They are losers of Bitcoin and are giving it a bad name. As for the chatters that visit and turn into "trolls", you can't blame them.

@_date: 2013-08-03 02:00:53
indeed, it was. realistically Bitcoin won't work because of the criminal state that governs the world. if Bitcoin and governments/banks (who corruptly work together) would accept Bitcoin alongside their doomed system (see, it's impossible), then that would be the perfect outcome. However, that is again, impossible and you will see that to be true, I think, inevitably. You really suppose they will adapt to the peoples desires? Haha.. you must not know what level of tyranny you are dealing with. You will adapt to their systems and desires, not the other way around. Bitcoin, and all the things that make it wonderful, just like freedom in the United States, has an expiration date. Tyranny always prevails over righteousness.

You think I don't know that? Again, I'm not an economist or never claimed to be. I'm using the classic dictionary term, not as it would be defined in economics. Why are you all assuming and jumping on me as if I'm using the words from economics perspective? Don't worry I really don't care personally, because I know what I'm saying, it's just silly to discredit me to others when your argument against me doesn't apply since I was never claiming to be using those terms from the position of an ECONOMIST. I don't care about a classic economist perspective, to be quite frank with you. Not in the LEAST, otherwise I would have gotten a degree in economics.

I agree with your post and this is also why I don't and have never got on the Obama band wagon when he is holding close to him every aspect of "the problem." Imagine if that stupid loser let things run their course? Bitcoin started around the same time he took office in 2009. Imagine if there was no Obama? Bitcoin would have already been the new world currency and the entire world would be experiencing prosperity. Barack Obama is the problem. If Bitcoin is to succeed, you must reject him.

I'm sure they owe me at least $5000 in Bitcoin for a late Jalapeno. For anyone thinking it is not possible to win this in court, or not worth the effort, you would be surprised. I'm sure if a lawyer was explained what happened, they would gladly fight this case. Your testimonies would help. It will also help the community if BFL gets what they deserve, because it will show this community is against Ponzi schemes and that we are not Ponzi scheme promoters because we use Bitcoins.

There's easily accessible and understandable documentation for everything.

they seem just as shady as the rest, and I don't think they, or anyone is really working in the best interests of the small guy. it's all greed, that seems to be the standard in the Bitcoin community, and I don't think it will change until Bitcoin is completely destroyed, and the guys with tons of Bitcoins will find that they are worth nothing, because the economy was destroyed by them. have fun

It's a big website and has a lot of exposure. The opinions on here are read by more than you might think, in my opinion of course. Anyone who is seriously trying to find direction in the market, is likely to check out this subreddit. Then also there are those who have a lot of Bitcoins and are just want to know what's new in Bitcoin world, so they check here. It may not be the number one source of latest developments but with the way Reddit filters out nonsense, it's not a bad place to stay up to date.

I'm no fan of Mt.Gox, but it looks to me like they (the US government) is clearly desiring to kill the Bitcoin market, by weakening the largest exchange which is Mt.Gox. Yes, killing the exchange is a great strategy if you want to weaken a currency. Less liquidity keeps larger investors away. Who's terrorizing who, in this case? I'm even afraid to speculate.

It really upsets me that these powerful/influential entities (governments such as Canada, US and banks) are against Bitcoin and trying to fight it. Do they really think they're going to outsmart humans innate insurpassable intelligent will to overthrown that which is false?? Haha! Earlier today I critized a gold mine tragedy (people died) in sudan on CNN, and they deleted my comment because all I said was "Bitcoin." They DO NOT like Bitcoin. When I say "they" I mean anyone who has power right now. They see the game is changing. I really hope Bitcoiners will be responsible with the limelight they now have? We really need to show the world what freedom is about. Don't you think? These forces who want to destroy this movement past them are not going to prevail, and they shouldn't.

Growth happens in waves. The whole world economy was suffering. Bitcoin may actually be the reason we are all alive right now. It is all part of God's plan. However, when people see BTC as an investment against the US dollar, then convert it to US dollars like hypocrites, this actually hurts BTC a lot. You should hoard it, you should hold on to it. You should let it's true value be realized by setting your sell price to infiniti, because the US dollar is actually completely worthless. In other words, you should hold onto your Bitcoins and only exchange them for things you need. If you need US dollars, you are part of the problem. The US dollar has degenerated into a DRUG ministered by the Federal Reserve. They criticize Bitcoins for being used to buy drugs, but the US dollar is by far the most dangerous drug on this planet.
@_date: 2013-04-28 14:36:58

You're an idiot. I never liked logarithmic charts when I was dealing with investments that were purely technical, simply because there was no real fundamentals behind them and the idiots that traded them were too stupid to know that. With Bitcoin however, it's the other way around. If I want to see what's really going on, I use the logarithmic.

@_date: 2013-07-12 11:47:40
The fundamentals I'm talking about are the actual facts about Bitcoin. Shops accepting Bitcoin is irrelevant. For all I care, no one could accept Bitcoin, but they do because the fundamental aspects of what utilities it caters to, remain. That's fundamentals. Given that notion, the so called volatility argument is not as strong as people make it out to be. Look at and take the alternatives into account (the US dollar). 50 years ago you could buy a house for $12,000. Today it will cost you 10 times that. Last year Bitcoins were trading at about 1/10th what they are trading at now, against the dollar, and there is a reason for that. I really have nothing else to say and I'm going to complete my end of the discussion at that. No, I'm not an economist, nor did I claim to be. I'm just posting my opinions.

I bought 100 bitcoins earlier this year on Coinbase, then since Coinbase offered the option to cancel, I did. They were $15 at the time and the following couple of weeks they doubled and quadrupled. I only canceled because I decided to use the money to rent a car and get a job. The job never paid me on time and left me with more expenses and broke. If I had held on to those bitcoins, I could have bought the car I rented, which was a huge expense when you're working for $10/hr. Stupid self.

yes, true to the form of free markets, after all you are trying to profit with these devices. why can't they profit as well? are you the only one who is allowed to profit? 9 BTC for 5GH/s, although it COULD be a better deal, it's still not something you should be complaining about, given that it will mine those back in 3 months, and anything else you mine after that is free money.

This would be great. Paypal could easily buy many millions worth of Bitcoin, then announce it is accepting it. They could quickly make a lot of money on a huge Bitcoin run to $1,000+ on that news alone. Plus, Ebay/Paypal is angry about internet taxes and I see this as a direct response to such, using decentralized currency in order to rebel against the internet tax. More power to them. Let them join the movement to destroy the parasitic government system which has been eating off our plate increasingly more and more liberally without relent, even under this "hope and change" joke of man who seems to do nothing more than read from a teleprompter and play golf/sports with CEOs, athletes, inviting them and celebrities to the white house while we get run over by a worthless and corrupt parasitic government system.

well I'm a bum. I was on the internet looking for opportunities and found bitcoin in 2011. unfortunately i didn't foresee a huge run to $250 in such a short period of time, otherwise I would have invested the sum of my wealth and been a millionaire, had I invested it at $3.00-$5.00. the annoying part is I always joked it would go past $100 soon, and then it did it like nothing. missed the ride because I was too busy working on my poker game on sealswithclubs (complete waste of time/distraction.) to be honest, at this point, I can't really say bitcoin has done anything for the situation of a bum who missed the big run. or for someone who has absolutely no money, and doesn't have at least 50 ghz of mining power, this community fails them, and ultimately will therefore be smothered by government who is already waging a moral attack on it.
@_date: 2013-08-02 04:08:31
You just gotta keep your eyes open, see who's story makes most sense, and watch and see if they deliver. Every day I'm researching all of the ASIC companies, plus watching Bitcoin and the economy as a whole. Amazing that I can do all this and not even have any college education, frankly I don't have time for that crap. Sorry to get off topic, but I'm trying to stress that in this game, you gotta get up and research every day, all the time. I'm a novice, I'm sure an electronics background would help but hey, no one was born inheriting all the time and knowledge in the universe so if you're like me, be a hawk in this game, looking for the prey constantly. I can summarize what info I've gathered with the conclusion that BFL sucks, they are liars, fuck them. KNC could screw everyone, I personally believe at this point that there is not enough clear communication that inspires confidence from me. Can they really deliver in the time frame they promise? If so, they are the best place to put your money right now. There are other's, such as BitFury, they look decent. I need to do more research there. There's also HashFast which just popped up out of no where, there's TerraHash who seems to have faded in the background on peoples radars, they have yet to begin delivering and seem kind of shady in my opinion, there's LabCoin. Those are all I know of.

Smart move, OP. You're going to be able to mine at least 10 blocks from that thing. Do the math, 10x25 = 250 Bitcoins. Say Bitcoin reaches a very feasible price of $300? That's $75k. My only worry would be the amount of time it takes for BFL to get you the thing. Even if it takes a while, however, you should still be good! A 60/GHz miner is going to be able to solve blocks for a while, and Bitcoin has a strong chance of being worth more and more as time goes by. Just make sure you actually get it, and you'll be good. Make sure you store those bitcoins offline so they don't get stolen, wait for them to go high as the world begins to adopt them in 1-3 years, and you just may have saved your financial future! I easily see this miner making $250,000 for you given all fundamentals.

you know what's ironic about your post? I'm 100% sure he can sell his avalon for 75 BTC to someone, right now, if need be. I know he can fetch $10k on Ebay for his avalon. What's $10,000 in BTC? Over 135 BTC, you retarded ass bitch. Same for OP, he can sell those 10 USB miners on Ebay for at least $250 each. You mother fuckers suck at math, common sense, and business altogether. Fuckwits.

Coinbase has been very good for Bitcoin in general. One thing I wish is that they would just go the whole way, and replace Mt.Gox, Bitstamp, and also run the securities game. Also become the place for best charts. Might as well start selling ASIC's too. We need one big professional company, something strong enough to destroy Paypal/Ebay/The Federal Reserve/The average dumbass. Long live Bitcoin.

Things evolve and if you try to inhibit evolution, you will destroy whatever is trying to evolve. In this case it is Bitcoin. There is nothing wrong with ASIC's being involved, even if friedcat single handily takes over the entire network, which he seems to be trying to avoid, by selling block erupters and blades and shares of his mining revenues. See? You really don't have an argument, you are simply jealous that your GPU mining game has come to an end. Do you really want to take down Bitcoin all because of your jealousy? Well that's extremely selfish but it wouldn't the first time an angry villain fucked it up for the rest of us. History will continue to repeat itself among fools, and the blameless will continue to inherit the result. Or, you can all go ahead, and migrate to Litecoins. Seriously, go. Leave the evolvers alone to our evil ways, you whiny little jealous late birds.

It makes no sense to buy from BFL. If you have done any research, they are lousy at shipping. I actually do not know of a single person who has actually received on of their high end miners, and even if they did, at that price it makes no sense when there are companies giving way better value for your money. KnC's Jupiter is a much better offer. They expect at least 400 Gh/s and it's a third of the price of that joke unit from BFL that you will probably never get if you order it. BFL is by far the shadiest company in this game.

you realize the same is true about the US dollar? the current value is way more than it's really worth. in fact it is only worth what it's worth because society accepts it to be that value regardless of the fact that there is no real value. you cannot exchange a US dollar at the bank for anything other than a US dollar. this is the same society that calls Bitcoins fake. anyway I strayed from the point sort of. the point is, you have no point.

They are more interested in taking from the community rather than giving. Of course, this is my opinion. That's the vibes I get.

I suggest all rich over night people to sharpen their judgement by taking up a game such as poker, and learn to make profit on that, so that you feel comfortable with money.

No, it's a pitiful disgrace, and anyone who allows them self to be so greedy as to be blind by that little token as false wisdom, is going to get what they deserve-burnt.

ASIC Miner is a great investment. The point I was disagreeing with most is that the plans to increase hash rate are not factored into the price. I believe the market reacts immediately on any facts. I used the price of BTC dropping and my belief that the consequence was a rise in diversified risk. Bitcoiners who may have been on the edge due to risk exposure, have decided that as Bitcoin drops in value against fiat currency, they expose themselves to risk by holding on as it continues to fall, while knowing that ASICMiner will continue to have value. While ASICMiner price per share technically went up, in fiat currency value, it has fallen a little. Where as it was $300+ per share, it is now less than that, even though the price has increased .30+ BTC per share over the past week.

Obama is a lot like Bitcoin actually. he himself is a currency and a system at the same time and only has value because people have decided to give him value, except there is one crucial difference: the decision to give Bitcoin value was actually based on something logical. the decision to give Obama value is illogical. I would even argue that Bitcoins' success is greatly hindered by Obama. I would say that Obama is intrinsically against all that is Bitcoin, and all that Bitcoin is, is value, and all that Obama is, is the lack thereof. With that said, I'm very sorry that you voted for him, OP.

Simple fact is, the more society learns about Bitcoin and how to use it, the more you'll be able to purchase things with it. Soon you should be able to ask individuals, rather than corporations, if they accept Bitcoin. Example, hey John is your amazing Subaru Wrx STi for sale? he says "Yea man how much will you pay for it?" then you say "Fuck, I have 1 bitcoins is that good?" he says "Yea man, that's like $25,000 right?" you say "correct, let me scan your bitcoin address on my phone?" *John pulls out the QR code he keeps handy* deal done.
