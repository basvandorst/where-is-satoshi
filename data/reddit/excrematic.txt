You need quality assurance, bug finding and user I/ex testing. Are you going to get different devices, different operating systems and test them at different times? You're paying for a service and potential marketing as if the site is useful, the people you pay will use it after the contract and tell their friends.

You shouldnt run ads for keywords you are already ranked for. It leads to false markets statistics and very bad spending on unique traffic.

They outsource articles like this to people who they pay around 20$ per article for. 
They pay 20$ for a 'hot article", they get 100k site visitors, they'll convert 2% into subscribers. Rinse and repeat.
Source: written ghost articles for companies, also gotten articles written for me, do marketing campaign for others which involve procuring articles for SEO / traffic purposes

So this is what Forbes considers good writing. 
Flaw in articles logic: author compares Bitcoin to the tulip bulbs in Holland. Last I knew planting plants is infinite. But mining bitcoin isn't. 
How can you work for Forbes and have the logic of an ideologic social justice warrior

They get paid in exposure? So you mean I can make Forbes look like idiots for my exposure. Good work head editors @ Forbes. Solid content marketing plan you have.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:56:42
Yeah so if you are already ranked for a keyword. Like let's say naturally if you type in Reddit Bitcoin, the search algorithm automatically puts out the link for Reddit Bitcoin sub first link (if ranked properly)
And if someone is typing in something as specific, you can assume that visitor is intending to go to your site anyway. 
So with these two things in mind, A) you rank high for a search term, B) that specific search term is already used to Target you specifically. 
You pay Google for ads to usually reach new visitors, or retarget old ones, usually in times and places where they weren't thinking of you. 
Let's say you're paying 5$ per 1000 clicks on Google.
And in this case you use "Reddit Bitcoin" as the ad search term. In another case let's say you use something more along the lines of "what is Bitcoin".
When some bloke searches "what is Bitcoin" and your ads shows, this is an opportunity to spread the reach of your sub, aka new unique site visitors. 
But with the "Reddit bitcoin" Google ad, you're paying ad costs for people who are going to your site anyway.
If you want new customers, are you going to bark at the people leaving your store, or the ones walking past it? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:32:08

@_date: 2017-09-15 21:32:04
I think he means that, over time, the value of Bitcoin will rise at a greater rate than the USD. 
And so if the renter kept the cash but gave away the Bitcoin. In 5 years time, or less, the Bitcoin will have a higher value than the cash. 
So in reverse. If the renter had the choice to pay with cash and hold the bitcoin. In 5 years time or less (way less), that bitcoin will have more value than the 1000$ cash he paid for rent. 
If you want, you can even leverage what you profit from Bitcoin rising and use that as a discount on your rent.

What did we learn here? No matter how awesome, Reddit is filled with a loud minority who's favorite pastime is complaining. And then getting karma ego strokes each time their meme gets front page.
