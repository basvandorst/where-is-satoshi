You can't erase the fact that I've got over $1500 sitting in his crater. Yes, it's partially my fault for leaving my money there and ignoring the signs, but the situation is still due to his (in)actions.

Does this mean you can _only_ use a blockchain.info wallet? I'd rather not touch that site at all if given a choice.

All details on how you can help are in the README at  Have at it!

I had a pending USD withdrawal that didn't show up in my balance when the current site was first put up, but it did after a month or so.

Keep using 0.9 unless you want to help test new features. This version is only a release candidate. It's not 100% ready for mass use quite yet.

It's a web wallet. Given the choice I'd much rather use software running on my computer. It wouldn't make much sense to me to tie a bitcoin service to a particular wallet, kind of defeats the point of decentralization.

I'm still waiting on a USD withdrawal from January 2nd.
@_date: 2014-08-24 15:58:09
Fair enough!

Bitcoin Bowl was an actual thing. It's over now, but it was a college football game between NC State and UCF. BitPay sponsored it, and decided to name it the Bitcoin Bowl.

Most people don't understand the implications of "programmable" though, for a lot of people that word just means "really complicated thing I can never understand."
I think "digital cash" gets the point across in a much more accessible way.

Are there any plans to make this run as a self-deployable server-side application? I'd love to throw this on one of my servers so I can reach it from mobile.

You've got to be kidding. Why not just make sure that the request is coming from the right email address associated with the account?
Sure, also verifying the password is correct increases your assurance that it's the correct person, but there's no way it's worth having the user send their password over email in plaintext. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 05:05:08
How long was your password? Was it the same password you used on any other sites? Has this password been shared with any other trusted parties? How long is the password for your email account? Is your email account password shared with any other sites? Do you have an active malware scanner on your computer? Have you done a full scan recently?
In answering all of these questions, don't assume you're doing the right thing already. Think it out very carefully. It's way too easy to dismiss the fact that you could be doing something wrong when an account gets compromised. You should assume that you are the weak link first.

What blog?

Nice video! You should put a link to the Lighthouse website in the description though, so people don't have to google the project to find it.
@_date: 2014-10-18 17:41:57
The name is also explained in the article that this post links to ;)
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:39:41
Haha, fair point. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:45:54
Yep. On ESPN, during the Bitcoin Bowl, which is going on right now.

Don't jump to the assumption that this is a hack. It's strange, but would be a weird thing for a hacker to do.

    Main Server 
    - 64-Core (4 x 8 Core CPU + Hyper-threading)
    - 96 GB of RAM
    - 600 GB SAS Raid 1
    - Networking : 2Gbps (two separate gigabit uplinks bonded)
That's a beefy-ass server.

I think you accidentally a word.

From the man himself:
20:10 &lt; Ymgve: the trade engine aborted execution when it saw that a trade was way too large to be "normal" and requested manual confirmation which is now done

Welp, time to pack it up guys. Bitcoin's all down hill from here.
@_date: 2011-05-16 05:59:31
Bitcoin has no servers. This is a Bitcoin client error.
@_date: 2011-06-10 12:26:50
So are you going to release it or are you just bragging? We don't care what you have if it's private.
@_date: 2015-04-05 00:32:50
I believe [micropayment channels]( use them.
