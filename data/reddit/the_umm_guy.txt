Then make them digitally sign some shit BEFORE they can get to their product. There are things you can put in place bro! Protect your shit!
Edit: letters and stuff.

Also, sorry you lost that cash man. That must've stung.

Yeah, that's the thing. Doing those types of things the "proper" way is difficult/time consuming. 
PayPal is a service that meets an immediate need. They've done a lot of that work for people. Many times I feel they get a bad wrap for being misunderstood.

Seriously? Fuck them? Dude, if you're going to sell something for $1000 WITHOUT PROOF OF DELIVERY you should be saying "fuck me".

That is true my good man, I wasn't considering international transactions. So what you'd want here is an IAT. which I don't have as much experience with.

This is the problem with using payment aggregators. Get your own merchant accounts and bypass pay pal completely. I don't feel like you should complain if you are simply using the wrong tool...
Edit: you'll also have transaction fees with a merchant account, but not as extreme from what I've seen.

If you used ACH transaction it'd take about three or four business days right? Seems reasonable... Instant bit coin would be preferable, but it's not a bad alternative....

It gives him proof of reception...
