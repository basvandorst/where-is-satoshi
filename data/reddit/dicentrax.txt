Jeeez, miners will be 'forced'? 
Get of your high horse, how many millions did you invest in your mining equipment?
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:38:49
Fine if you use bitcoin as digital gold/store of value,  totally unacceptable if you use bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:23:49
My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2017-02-02 13:48:58
Totally agree
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:13:18
Bitcoin has no leaders
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:21:39
Part of the community argues we should do both...

What would happen if segwit has a fatal flaw?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:46:07
miners area very important part of the network.... so
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:03:08
yes but dont you understand? It doesnt have to be limited, you could send 100000 for 0.005 cents before this ridiculous scaling debate got out of hand 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:44:05
Segwit is like a high performance sportscar build around a tiny engine.

You´ll have GPU-CPU pools in no time... with dedicated GPU farms in... china

Segwit is like a riced honda, BU is like a 1969 dodge charger
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:22:23
Ok so UASF is pretty dangerous then, as it means that people with money can simply fire up thousands of nodes and influence bitcoin without the need for PoW or good (peer reviewed) code.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:43:59
Wait, isn't BU an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:15:57
As far as I know UASF does not even have core support, so its irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:21:07
Both subreddits are clear examples of human nature and group think. Politics, propaganda, backstabbing, demonizing of individuals... its quite amazing actually  and it proves that we are just a bunch of primates with slightly larger brains. 
Luckily the bitcoin decentralized system doesn't care about petty human conflicts, it will scale when it wants to or not... whatever.
One thing is clear, the network is very very hard to change... and that's very very good
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:54:26
"Wow this is crowded, must be fast"....nope

So you are telling me that 1 person (or small group) can cause a transaction backlog....
Basically you only need a couple of million  to make bitcoin unusable?

but they could be corrupt, and if enough of these big exchanges are....
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:33:24
I agree, just split the network and let economics decide which is better
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:15:24
- Segwit from 38% back to 26%
- BU from 35% to 43%
- Price 944 --&gt; 992

Riiiiight... everybody that doesn't agree with you is corrupted.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:40:41
sooo... just implement segwit on an altcoin for westerners only?
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:39:23
too bad a quality post like yours is downvoted to oblivion
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:48:50
Why Segwit was not created to win
1. Antpool will never support Segwit and is the biggest supplier of mining equipment
2. Without Antpool Segwit will not get more than ~95%
3. Wang chun is not an idiot at all and won't gamble with 50/50 odds
4. Antpool have just started shipping of their last generation miners
5. Antpool is one of the biggest pools with a lot of influence
See? Goes both ways, we seem to be in an impasse....
edit: mistake
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:06:47
True, and most do, but that wasn't the point.
When bitcoin splits... people will flock to the chain with the cheapest transactions and the fastest confirmation times.

Yes everyone that doesn't agree with you must be: fake/shill/paid/bribed/threatened/irrational
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:18:10
Sure I'll use the bitcoin chain that provides fast $0.01 transactions, no need to use an "altcoin"
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:27:32
There is no difference, everybody can use the system as they see fit

Please get a grip, there is no need to get triggered...
How much do the DDoS-ers pay the websites again?
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:11:34
Well, except if you are a miner not signalling for segwit, then they call you evil and come up with a UASF to "force" you in line.
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:47:13
So even the altcoins don't want segwit....
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:59:30
Doesn't matter if the transactions are with malicious intent, the point is that bitcoin should be able to handle it...and it cant right now because of the ridiculous 1MB cap
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:26:40
If they pay their fee, who are you to decide if they are "legit" or not
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:07:19
So does core
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:51:09
There is also an option available that removes the capacity restriction completely. You could say it makes bitcoin unlimited....
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:06:54
What are the chances of him finding a block, when there are thousands of people with GTX1080...?
And what are his chances when there are hundreds op people with 10x GTX1080?
He does have a cost you know... he needs to run the GTX1080 24/7 at max power.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:59:58
If segwit is what its proponents say it is... it would have much more backing than ~30% of the hashrate.
A compromise would be an nice bump of maxblocksize + segwit
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:34:20
Why didnt this happen when we had &lt;1mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:56:34
They already control the block size, they don't have to mine 1MB blocks....I dont trust individual miners I trust the basic principle of bitcoin and its trust less decentralised system.
OP puts trust in a centralised bunch of coders to decide whats best for the system... sorry I don't want a bitcoinFED.
Segwit can only activate by consensus, if it cant then its not good enough.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:35:22
You mean core..... right?
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:47:45
If segwit has 0% of the hashrate and 95% of the nodes... nothing will happen.
Miners work for the block reward, as it should be. It provides an incentive to invest in mining equipment, which in turn provides security of the system. 
Fees are not the main source of income (yet)
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:20:46
Jeez, I cant believe I'm reading this... you trust a bunch of coders with negligible stake in the network over people that have invested millions op un millions in mining equipment.....if coders mess up they can shrug it off en move on to the next project, if miners f up they lose everything.
Also, you shouldn't (have to) trust anyone in a decentralised network
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:52:12
You must be pretty naive if you think core doesn't have its army of sock puppets trolling the forums
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:11:57
People will flock to the chain with the cheapest transactions fees  and the fastest confirmation times....its just economics
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:35:41
jezus, thats some twisted logic you got there...
Bitcoin = PoW, changing it is like changing the 21million cap.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:18:18
Yes, I wan't them to spend all their money trying to "spam" the network... bitcoin has already failed if it needs people like you for its "protection"
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:16:54
Who are these "stakeholders" ?
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:05:50
They are afraid that your "medicine" is a poison pill.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:24:48
Funny they say the same thing about r/bitcoin, who should I believe as a new user?
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:04:15
Wrong, miners work for the btc reward...
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:14:27
Sample size is actually larger as hard forks happend in the past with bitcoin and other cryptos. The ETH/ETC split is an outlier
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:29:59
How short of a time interval?  I bet you all BU node operators are fully aware/monitoring possible attacks...
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:02:25
Sorry don't see it, I see a variation between 22% to 28% with a median of ~25%... there is no significant increase. Wake me up when it passes 35% for 1000 blocks.
I'll make a prediction too; when BU goes down, price can go up or down... when segwit goes down, price can go up or down.
If we don't resolve these petty scaling wars soon, price will go down forever....
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:40:37
If that's true than bitcoin is dead... it means anybody that can fire up enough nodes rules bitcoin....right?
@_date: 2017-03-01 09:49:08
Well it preserves wealth when the failed FIAT goes into hyperinflation mode
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:12:21
Funny, that's exactly how I would describe you...
You are the one that started with the reflexive one-liner, you can still read the previous posts right?
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:26:17
So why aren't they capping blocksize to 100kb then? 
Nobody forces them to mine 1MB blocks....hell they can even mine 0 transaction blocks if they really want to.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:18:36
With millions of GPUs the chances of finding a block are slim.....maybe we should combine our GPU hashpower with others and call it a hive or something, we can split the btc reward...
The next best thing for big big profits is to go where the electricity is cheap...maybe Norway or somewhere in asia?
Hopefully some random devs do not get mad at us and change the rules of mining again.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:00:40
If the transaction fees are too high, users will use it less 
,less users means  less transactions, means less miners
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:41:41
Just google it my friend
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:41:24
How do you differentiate from malicious nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:40:17
Haha, Yes I meant segwit  :)
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:50:22
Doesn't matter what BitGo does or doesn't do.... alternatives will take its place if they don't act fast enough.
Also wasn't BitGo the wallet that got hacked?

So... you mean after the attack on BU nodes?
Were they online within seconds or hours?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:18:23
Well it has a fee market, and the spammer pays the fees soooo... must be working as intended then....right?
@_date: 2017-03-16 07:28:32
Its pretty clear to me bitcoin will not scale in the near future, both segwit and BU are so polarizing I don't think either will gain a majority.
Maybe a third party of developers could come up with a compromising solution?
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:21:14
It will become p2p gold...
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:59:07
They say exactly the samething about core, it seems like the whole community is pretty toxic....
Luckily, nobody can "control" bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:07:50
Aha yeah... If I have the choice to pay $0.01 per transaction or $2 for exactly the same service.. I'll know what I'll do
@_date: 2017-03-27 08:35:55
Yes, so we can agree that segwit support is stagnant ~25% and any short term up or down spikes are not correlated with price.....
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:54:16
I think they currently profit more from a healthy network.... If a miner spams the backlog with its own paid transactions it isn't really worth it if there is a chance of a competing miner getting the block + fee reward.
It will only work if all miners collude in spamming and sharing the tx fee bonus, which I dont think is the case now
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:39:52
Could be, but hashrate voting is one the very foundations of bitcoin.
The consensus needs to be system wide, you can't just ignore such an important part of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-23 17:01:17
And core are not the ones willing to compromise either.
If we had segwit + 2Mb hardfork as per Hong Kong agreement, there would have never been a BU.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:46:42
oh, please jihan wu has a cartel now.....
But your answer is an UASF which is basically voting with FIAT instead of PoW.......this is getting ridiculous!
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:54:33
Segwit support crashing -&gt; recovery continues...................  Expect market swings as long as these petty scaling wars are not resolved.

Who is "we"? Need support from your fellow trolls?
@_date: 2017-01-27 07:43:01

@_date: 2017-01-11 08:08:54

@_date: 2017-01-17 10:20:39
You are missing the point.
This is an example of new tech trying to scale bitcoin without segwit/BU. There will be many such innovations along the way, most of them will be "shit" but some of them will work.
@_date: 2017-01-12 08:41:13
more sellers than buyers
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:24:03
I agree, hardforking would be very painful but at least the market could decide which idea is best.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:50:24
I love the comments below te article too...
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:52:51
Its not about bitcoin per se, more about the overall state of the economy and crazy central bank policies. When this house of cards comes crashing down gold/silver will go up up up..... but bitcoin will go to the moon ;)
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:17:16
Great, I belong to a "side" now?
Look I couldn't care less if bitcoins scales with segwit, on-chain or both. But this petty conflict is starting to get downright idiotic on both "sides"
@_date: 2017-01-18 09:31:13
Ok, just to humor you I'll touch some of your points:
Crimea----- 
Russia actually has a very important naval base on crimea, its their only direct connection to the Mediterranean sea, when the democratically(!) elected Ukrianian president was overthrown by western backed groups.. Russia made the strategic decision to secure its naval base and not letting it fall in the hands of NATO.... cant blame them.
NATO is supposed to be a defense force, why on earth are they performing large military exercises on the borders of Russia? Imagine Russia placing 1000+ tanks and troops on the border of Mexico.... besides Russia spends 66 billion on defense, the top 5 NATO countries combined spend 765.6 billion, so who should be scared of who?
Meddling in western elections----
Its no secret that all nations on earth spy and hack, even allies do it to each other. So don't be surprised that russia hacked the democratic party, be more surprised of the fact that the democratic party isn't as democratic as we all thought it was..
Look Assad is a dictator, but how did the "Arab spring" turn out for most countries? how is Tunisia doing? how is Libia doing? how is Egypt doing? how is Iraq doing?  Bombing a dictator to smithereens doesn't create a blossoming democracy, it creates a power vacuum that's filled by friendly folks like ISIS.
Also ask yourself why Assad the terrible dictator must go. But Saudi-Arabia, who are even worse, are head of the human rights council... crazy
We do not have to be friends with the russians, but we have to remember that they have their geopolitical interests and we have ours. I bet nobody wants a (nuclear)war, so we need to have dialog... Putin said he is open for dialog, would the USA be with president Clinton?
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:41:15
I always wandered how many miners there actually are...
The big 4 are "pools", and new mining pools seem to pop up regularly. So how many miners does an average mining pool contain...anybody know?
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:42:14
Sooo there is a "big blocker" chinese bitcoin miner conspiracy? And our saviors are the divine core team? And the people not agreeing with our ideology are fake deplorables?
ok got it......
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:43:21
So it will never activate as BU has ~15% block support
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:13:29
The real question is what you will do on $1000.... hodl or sell?

So you are saying that there is a small group of people in control of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:48:44
You don't know if its shit or not, anyway we need to scale and both Segwit and BU adoption has pretty much stagnated.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:19:32
They are both evenly (un)popular.
The hashrate for both BU and Segwit is ~30%, and are supported by a similar amount of mining pools. 
Segwit will activate at 95%, but it will never reach that threshold...
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:36:21
You missed the option for the restaurant to exand its business, so more costumers can be served. 
But your analogy is flawed anyway, bitcoin is decentralised there is no bitcoin CEO deciding the strategy. If the transactions are paid with fees, they are legit... if someone wants to spend a million in transactions to himself.. thats totally fine.
Your Uber/Lift analogy is equally flawed, Uber never paid a dime it ordered and cancelled rides... now if it had actually paid for the rides I dont think Lyft would have complained.
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:47:46

Why would I get banned? I'm just stating a fact
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:49:43
Maybe at some point these company's will figure out by themselves how to mine bitcoin. The mining network will become more and more decentralised with miners that dont care or know about the politics around bitcoin. So if these "ignorant" miners gain a sizable percentage, they could block any further bitcoin improvements 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:23:24
Shoudn't matter if bitcoin is truly a decentralized and "trustless" system. If the actions of one individual can disrupt bitcoin, then bitcoin has a serious problem.
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:47:41
Also, FED rate hike
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:54:34
So the bitcoin system can be influenced by individuals? You are telling met that .gov can break bitcoin by simply spending a couple of million on spam transactions?
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:03:01
Difficult but not impossible, core itself stated that segwit is not needed for off-chain lightning networks.
Even right now a lot of bitcoins change hands off-chain on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:52:12
It doesn't matter how much something has been tested, unforeseen bugs/exploits are unforeseen.
Besides, you are placing 'trust' in the capability of a handfull of people in what should be a 'trustless trust' decentralized network.
This applies to both Blockstream and BU...
I think we have reached the status quo of bitcoin, and scaling pressure will result in innovative solutions on top of bitcoin or the rise of an alternative cryptocurrency
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:20:28
This experiment is dead if we have to worry about a random person or group trying to control bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:33:07
Segwit is a risk to peoples wallets too.
What happens if segwit contains an unforseen bug or exploit?
At least with a hardfork you have coins on both chains.....
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:15:44
Only a system wide consensus can changes the rules... it will be a slippery slope if "users aka nodes" get to make these kind of fundamental decisions
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:32:39
because segwit has 0% of activating with the 95% threshold
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:43:03
Extension blocks is the better solution, and I think it has the most chance of gaining system wide consensus. Some miners opposing segwit already stated their interest in EB
@_date: 2017-04-20 06:52:33
I'd like to see that evidence....
@_date: 2017-04-13 09:42:49
Yes you need a majority of the miner community to back a PoW change, how else are you going to make sure the network forks safely?
How do you measure an economic majority?

  - so actually closer to ~17% but it varies week to week
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:15:45
SegWit isn't contentious, it just doesn't have majority backing.

Not really... think about it. Why are there high profile core developers funded by blockstream? Why is it a must to have decentralised mining, but is it absurd to have decentralised development?
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:27:36


Please, one of the main UASF proponents and core dev luke-jr, said that even 1mb blocks were already too big...


Sure, but UASF is not a safe option, its a minority with ~1000 nodes and &lt;0.2% hashrate trying to force the issue.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:53:51
You should be equally worried about developer centralisation and corruption
 
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:38:10
If bitcoin can be threatened by an random chinese guy, then it has failed.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:15:09
right.....and you must be the guy that decides how the (decentralised) bitcoin network should scale
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:18:51
Layer 1 has been cheap for years, the only thing that makes it expensive is the 1Mb blocks strangled network.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:57:25


How do you know for sure? because they are not listed on blockstreams website? AFAIK blockstreams and bitcoin core's interests are perfectly aligned. Also, where are those 100 other developers you speak of? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 11:07:51
Is that your feeling, or do you have actual proof for that statement?
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:57:06
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:18:04
Jees, this UASF cult is getting more ridiculous each day
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:11:04
Oh please.. the latest round of "bitcoin independence day" propaganda is ridiculous and you know it.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:15:29
so? maybe both sides are rotten and spew propaganda
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:04:18
AFAIK, 100% of core developers are funded by blockstream,  AFAIK blockstream received significant funds from AXA. AXA has close ties to the financial/ banking industry.
See how easy it is to produce propaganda?
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:54:52
So a government with a couple of billion to spend on spam, could make bitcoin transactions really expensive for a long time....
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:11:43
Had a quick look and I count 3... 
but its only 3 people right? no conflict of interest there... one of the most outspoken bitcoin core developers is CTO at blockstream.. doesn't matter at all.
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:08:07
And you are stuck on the bitmain is the devil narrative.
Bitmain does not have &gt;51% hashrate nor does it have the power to change the network... we would be running BU if it had.
The thing is, bitcoin can only change with system wide consesus. That means a majority of miners AND economic nodes, thus bitcoin IS internationally decentralised in that way.
The only centralised point I could see was in development, that's why I'm happy with alternative clients like segwit2x gain the support it has.


Bitmain even more so, its profits and investments are tied directly to the health of the network. Hell, for all we know, blockstreams intend is to cripple bitcoin and paid $55 million for it to happen, maybe with some covert help from the FED? ;)


Governments attacking bitcoin have always been a threath, if you think the chinese are scary. Wait till bitcoin starts to threaten the US dollar.....
The idea has always been to make an attack on bitcoin so expensive that even the most malicious actors see more merit in participating in the network, rather than destroying it.
But believe me, if governments start their war on bitcoin, we will know it. And it's not going to be some covert ops through bitmain
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:20:58
Nice list!
- too bad actually only ~50 have contributed anything and a meager ~30  have more than 10 commits since 2016
- 14 are the 'main' contributors ( 3 are paid by blockstream)
- 3 people 'maintain' the project
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:03:15
logic left this sub a long time ago
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:05:05
Wait, I thought high fees was a good thing....?
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:35:11
His arguments were solid
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:52:37


Honestly, not trying to do that.


Yes sure, China could command mining hardware perform a 51% attack and tank the value of bitcoin. However governments could also simply ban all exchanges and make bitcoin illegal.... this risk is always there. But what is your point exactly? we should block bitmain as a preemtive strike of sorts? change PoW?


I completely agree


That's were we disagree, I think bitmain is just a big bitcoin mining pool/hardware manufacturer. However, its high public profile and ASIC production make it a target for government intervention.
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:33:34
core devs are free to join work on segwit2x
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:56:30
Patent law of what country?..... patents are not global you know.
And as bitcoin has no borders, you'll need to file a patent for each individual country or even region within a country. Good luck with that
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:03:18
There is something wrong with bitcoin if it can be spammed this easily
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:14:55
I can give you names of high profile bitcoin core contributors that work for blockstream... but you don't care about that do you?
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:16:14
same for the UASF cultists
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:25:57
So who controls the pools that are signalling segwit? and what about all those other pools signalling neither?
And of course, slush is signalling both...
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:27:48
If scaling isn't solved soon those tickets will come with a $10 bitcoin transaction fee..... nobody is going to buy stuff with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:23:00
code is law, but miners enforce the code with hashpower.
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:12:35
Don't know... happy to sign on for a paid job as a blockstream troll though
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:04:06
I see,  high fees are a feature that people want right?
They are much happier now that it costs them more to move their coins...
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:11:52
I guess we'll find out soon 
@_date: 2017-07-14 23:00:20
~1000 nodes and &lt;0.2% hashrate is not enough
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:33:09
you think only ~100 people know how to code?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:41:06


When are they going to disappear to ensure they dont become dictators?
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:12:26
Ah yes things get more valuable when less and less people want it...
Got it...
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:22:02
it's both
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:06:03
You need a majority of the miners, if it doesn't have the hashpower it fails.


Core aren't the leaders of bitcoin either....
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:52:26
Everybody that uses bitcoin is part of the community....
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:26:13
Right, that's why we still have 56Kbps modems, no need to improve internet speeds...look at all that demand and better yet those dumb users are paying $10 a minute. 
Its that simple really... you have a product that people want and then you artificially limit its supply... $$$ profits that's how all honest and successful businesses work right?
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:31:08
you still need miners...
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:34:46
actually, there was a 2016 hong kong agreement between miners and core, that one also included a 2MB HF.
Unfortunately, after significant delays, core did not deliver as promised.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:25:51
You assume the majority of nodes are individuals. And you assume that a majority of these individuals do not want segwit2x.
I argue the majority of nodes are owned by businesses/exchanges and miners. And are the nodes that actually matter and define consensus.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:21:58
Nice to see some reasonable posts between all these UASF fanboys
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:59:24
that's absurd,  cheap fees are not going to destroy bitcoins value
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:35:01
*splitting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:13:17
As far as I know bitmain signed both the hong kong &amp; new york agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:37:12
High security does not come from high fees, it comes from high hashrate chasing the block reward.
Yes, in the far future miners will earn money from fees alone. 
But it will not be a few &gt;$1000 fees per small block, it will be thousands of &lt;$1 fees per big block 
Bottom line; less people are going to "use" bitcoin if the fee to move 1 bitcoin is $100.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:13:35


As far as I know, a "hard-fork based on the revised segwit program" was never planned/developed by the core devs
@_date: 2017-06-03 17:00:29
If jihan controls 75%, why isn't BU activated yet?
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:15:43
UASF isn't supported by the majority either....
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:15:04
Yeah temporary as in decades.... the last block reward will be paid in 2130, give or take 20 years... and even then there is no need for high fees when you have bigger blocks with thousands of fees per block and off chain solutions.
I'm describing the system as it was 2 or 3 years ago....decentralised, cheap, fast &amp; secure. 
Your last remark makes no sense, it is very very important for bitcoin to have as many people as possible buying it, holding it and using it. This drives the bitcoin economy, its business, its innovation, its security and its usability.
You are describing the road to a smothered stagnant insecure slow expensive crypto...who is going to use that for storing their wealth?
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:09:20
Those silly japanese... didn't they get the memo?
You are not supposed to buy things with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:27:32


Not sure if I follow your logic...... so 1 BU node can prevent segwit activation?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:52:13
We'll see what happens soon enough
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:28:14
isn't it ironic then, that antpool is the one that occasionally mines 'empty' blocks? :)
Miners still make most money with blocks, if they drive the users away with high fees, then those blocks become worthless.
Also, miners intend to run segwit2x, so miners and users interests are perfectly aligned.
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:28:48
Come on, core has been very vocal against a HF.
For some reason they signed an agreement they did not intend to follow through.
We are now back to square one with the New York agreement, it has 83% hashpower backing and support of 55 companies.
And again it seems to be core that's bitching and stalling progress.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:53:07
That's why 80% runs segwit2x
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:23:59
you got the hash power to back that statement up?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:02:50
Every player in the system is important. not a few miners, not a bunch of developers and not a select few users.... everyone.
There isn't a "priviliged" group in bitcoin, that's the whole point
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:00:21
We'll be getting segwit + 2MB HF
Get over it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:50:18
whats better:
20 miners with 1Mhash/s
20 miners with 1000 Phash/s
hashpower gives security to the system, the more hashpower the more expensive it is to 51% attack the network
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:09:14
Good job on dodging the question....
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:48:41
We'll find out soon
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:56:25
That's were we disagree I guess
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:31:58


A bunch of developers shouldn't be able to force an upgrade like that, and they can't or we would have had segwit by now.


So who ever can spin up the most nodes wins? 
To make a change in bitcoin, you need major hashpower AND backing of the biggest companies in the network (where the money is)... everyone else is irrelevant. Us 'individual' users can only vote by (not) using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:45:58
Edit: 80% signal intend to run segwit2x
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:20:39


Yeah, well I always wonder where that 100-200 number comes from. Cores websites states there are ~20 regular contributors and that there are 'many others' that contribute more casually.
But if you then check github from the past 2 years, there are like only ~40 people with &gt;10 commits....
Am I missing something?


You have proof for that statement?


As far as I know it doesn't, there are even 'main' core devs stating that 1MB is actually too big.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:34:22
If segwit2x does not activate, bitcoin will split
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:42:12
yes, I agree. You really need to do that
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:26:44


Let's say I've enough money to buy 1% hashrate and ~1000 nodes, does that mean I now own bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:45:10
Segwit2x + 2Mb is going to happen.  Get over it
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:16:14
UASF is threatening the network, its an attack.
Segwit2x is bitcoins last hope for preventing a split in the network.
Edit:  neh.. just joking, the UASF "movement" is actually pretty insignificant. 
The real threat is altcoins taking over bitcoins lead
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:00:21
Yeah yeah... everyone that has a different opinion is a paid shill and needs to be ridiculed...... I guess that's how propaganda works?
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:42:44
People that react with "LOL" can't be taken seriously
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:52:54
No, you think bitcoin with $100 fees is more secure than bitcoin with $1 fees, and therefore somehow more attractive to rich people. And I disagree.
 
Besides that, your idea for bitcoin to become an system for the elite is something I dislike very much.
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:00:05
I see, so where does this 75% number come from?
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:44:18
Better have 100 people who invest $1M AND 100000 people with $100.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:16:12
Not if segwit2x has overwhelming support
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:26:57


Its not "reality" when it's your fantasy
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:20:46
No seriously, it's clear to me you know very little.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:14:36
Yeah ok, but signalling starts 21 july right? 
So if signalling shows support for segwit2x activation, bitmain will not UAHF.
@_date: 2017-06-29 08:41:09


Nobody should be "running" bitcoin, and nobody is.
Jihan Wu does not rule bitcoin, he couldn't get BU activated and Core doesn't rule bitcoin either, as they did an even worse job at trying to activate segwit.
Bitcoin can and should only change with system wide majority support.
Also a group of devs calling themselves the "core" sounds incredibly centralized. I'd rather see multiple dev teams competing with each other.
I'm am very happy to see (non-core) segwit2X activate in the short term.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:07:41
Oh median transaction times are changing froggy
and its gonna get a lot worse


Funny core proposes segwit... sounds like a scaling solution to me
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:55:06
The 1MB cap is artificial and you know it.
Your last sentence makes no sense, nobody is talking about "giving away stuff for free".
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:39:41
You are advocating for a bitcoin with slow, expensive and unreliable transactions. That's a very wrong direction for bitcoin to take.
I'm very happy to see that people with your ideas are a minority
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:30:26
Edit: Thats why 80% signal intend to run segwit when its finished
@_date: 2017-06-29 06:54:28
Don't need to worry about Africa, they won't use bitcoin if it has $5 fees.... problem solved
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:51:27
Yes, but the current 1MB cap is far too low, it makes the fees too high too soon.  A 8MB blocksize would give the fee market some air... miners still have income form the block reward.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:21:46
People are not "using" bitcoin, they are holding it
They are buying it, hoping to sell it later at $$ profits.
It wouldn't surprise me if most bitcoins change hands off-chain on exchanges.
The bottom line is, who is going to pay airline tickets with bitcoin if fees are $15?
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:33:03
The segwit2x agreement shows 80% hashrate and businness support.
If the remaining 20% decide to fight then you are right. They will split off into an altcoin.
We'll know 21st of july how much support segwit2x actually has.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:21:45
I really don't agree, strangling bitcoins usability with an 1MB cap does not give the system value.
If consistency is king, we wouldn't have needed all those other BIP's over the years...
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:00:39
Core does not support the New York agreement, and some core developers actively promote UASF
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:52:42
Interesting, you want to give a few "special" people central control over a decentralized system
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:41:29
Its bitterness because their UASF appears to be a dud
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:58:01
The miners are as divided on the scaling solution as the rest of the community.
~40% signal BU 
~30% signal segwit
~30% signal status quo
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:30:56
you mean the nodes of the exchanges, businesses and miners that signed the segwit2x agreement? yeah... nodes wont be much of a problem.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:48:33
Your statement is not correct.
In the hong kong agreement, miners en devs agreed to do segwit + 2MB HF 
Developers were late with segwit en did not include 2mb HF
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:49:02
woops sorry, I didn't know there was an anointed elite needed with the "privilege" of coding for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:07:36
The question is not who is spamming, but why bitcoin can be spammed in the first place...
Could a government make bitcoin unusable if they block the network with a couple of billion$$ worth of spam transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:30:02
yeah yeah...I know...I know, people that don't agree with you don't understand bitcoin. You are right and everyone else is wrong
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:09:58
Oh please, enlighten me then.... high fees gives crypto value how?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:48:11


But if its clear that segwit2x has major support in those 11 days, then UASF will have failed and there would be no need for bitmain to HF
