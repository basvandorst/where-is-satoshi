Why do you think anyone who disagrees with you is a 'shill'? All these bitcoin vs western union comparisons are just dumb and that's all people are trying to say. This subreddit seems to be full of people who don't know much  about bitcoin or economics other than that bitcoin is better than everything else no matter what and in a few years there won't be anything else, which of course most of them read here. Bitcoin is cool, but it's just a technology, and one in It's infancy at that, with a lot of unanswered questions and outstanding barriers to mass uptake. Why not just be objective about it? Why is she standing outside a Barclay's bank with that thing anyway?
Queue hateful response that ignores my points and instead simply  accuses me of posting this because I work for western union.

The WU form shown is an actual paper form though, and there are much easier ways to pay by WU online nowadays. Once you have an account set up you can log in whenever and send money with just a few clicks and entering the amount and receiver. It's still a little bit more work than the bitcoin example, but the comparison shown here is hardly fair, not to mention WU still holds a big advantage for lots of people when it comes to actually cashing in on what you've been sent.
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:49:09
I'm actually a fan of bitcoin, and no I don't work for WU, I just use it a lot. Pointing out that this is a stupid comparison doesn't have to be anything more than that, so why don't you take off your tinfoil hat and go back to masturbating you dickwad.

Nice one mate, you totally won. I can only imagine how great you must feel.
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:58:54
Yeah, I know. The rational points came before that. Remember, when you battened down the hatches and went into full retard mode.
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:43:54
I was referring to your tinfoil hat ad hominem bullshit and complete inability to accept valid points from other people. You made it quite clear from your first reply to my comment that there wouldn't be any adult discussions going on.

What happens to utxos from before the fork if both forks get some traction?

Signing is just encrypting with a private key. 
Edit: Sorry,  meant just with rsa. I was assuming this is what the guy 2 above meant by using the same math.

So your immortal descendants can have a good laugh at how shit it was compared to theirs? Or maybe a copy of you will get to live in a zoo someday. (By the way, I think you mean your DNA sequence. All life on earth shares the same geneic code.)

So how does a consumer get them to buy stuff from local merchants with them? We understand bitcoin isn't "banned" in new york or something like that, but there's no point in trying to argue it won't have a noticeable negative effect for users if companies avoid NY due to the licensing problem.

This is an argument against the general concept of having a will, not this approach to leaving one with BTC. Given the question, I'm assuming OP has already decided that he has isn't worried about his wife offing him for the will.

I would be happy to infiltrate a few circles if the community thinks it would help... :)
@_date: 2015-07-19 02:51:27
What you could do is XOR the private key with two random one time pads. It would be literally impossible to recreate the original key from the final encrypted key without having both pads, so you give one ot the attorney and one to your wife and give each a copy of the encrypted key. You can also extend this with as many pads as you want and the same logic aplies.

Represented in what way? M as you it's just me but I don't think you explained that very well...

Yeah, it's difficult hear a 15 minute talk offering nothing new from one side of a complex argument and not somehow gain divine insight into the future.
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:33:45
No reasonable doubt, but yes I do. Can you prove he didn't steal those keys from someone, or invent a machine in secret that can generate the signature without the private keys? If not then how can you be sure.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:15:27
Not really, its still a matter of being convinced to a certain extent. Cryptography can convince you beyond all reasonable doubt, but it still isn't absolute. Maybe aliens gave him a computer that can brute force it in a reasonable time. Since were so concerned with proof, could you prove that didn't happen if someone signed with satoshis keys?

Try having a meaningful volume of transactions at 21 million BTC to the dollar. I know this is an extreme example but it clearly shows that your claim isn't true.
