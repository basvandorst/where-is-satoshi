Careful with interpretation of these stats at bitnodes.io. I'm running a full node (v0.91) from Greece, but i'm nowhere to be seen in there. When I run the little test at the bottom of this page  my IP address returns positive.

It's currently taking up 21.52 GB on my disk

My home-run node is 3 blocks ahead of you.

Well, for one we could stop spreading this FUD en start reading

Cool! I wished I had discovered this earlier. I'm all setup now, following more or less the same steps. I'll bookmark this one though for future reference.
One question: can you add instruction how to update the Git repository that you cloned earlier, so that we can keep our nodes up to date with the latest version (now v0.14.1)? That would be swell, I'm kinda stuck there, seemingly not able to find my way through the git forest :-(

Where can we find it?

Thank you indeed! Very well explained.

I think that "They will not need..." referred to "everyone", not "a PHP programmer"

Not so great I'm afraid, it's still happening to me, even after if upgraded to Mavericks. I've given up running the Qt client on my MBP as a result: reindexing the database can't be completed anymore within my usual power-up/down cycles. :-(

The badge is a very cool idea!

Your bitcoins are not stored on your local computer, your bitcoins will not be stored with a reputable financial institution either. They are "stored" in the blockchain (the "ledger"), which is distributed over the whole Bitcoin network. You only need to somewhere save the public and private key of the addresses where you have transferred bitcoins to. You can do that on a piece of paper. That's it. Think of it. No more bank-rupting, just dis-rupting!

My thoughts exactly. And I'm a customer at bitcoin.de. Don't like this. Not one bit... euh... coin.

Any chance this will come to Europe too one day?
