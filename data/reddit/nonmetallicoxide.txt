Incorrect. This is the latest Monero block:  All inputs and outputs are cryptographically unlinkable and untraceable. Even the ammounts sent are obfuscated. This is what an oplaque blockchain looks like.
With Bitcoin, if you get some tainted bitcoins, you can send it to as many addresses as you want, that taint will stay.

You do understand that the main problem here is Bitcoin's transparent ledger and lack of any useful obfuscation of transactions right? It has nothing to do with your constitutional rights or government overreach, they're going to do their job and arrest weapons and narcotics dealers in accordance to their state laws.

It's the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain. Each bitcoin input can be traced to every single output no matter how many wallets you create.

It isn't so simple, even that technique can be broken. The root cause of this problem is a transparent blockchain.

I'm talking about transactions and addresses in the blockchain, not IP addresses.

It is safe to assume that a government will always be hostile and will always overreach. There isn't a fight to be had. The only real way to combat this is to make it *impossible* for them to spy on you whether it be by building second layers on top of bitcoin to improve fungibility or to diversify into more private cryptocurrencies.

It should be that techniques like these are impossible with legit blockchain obfuscation.
