Perhaps we will see a similar story when crypto really takes off and the dollar is worth almost nothing. " Man spends 10,000$ on papa johns pizza to stay alive for a few more days. " 
people will be like " pff should have bought into Ameracoin when the government converted. "

well until it really takes off. A bitcoin is a digital file that only holds value because at some point people can trade it for IOU's from the government. But then if you don't give some of those IOU's back to the IRS they will come take a hell of alot of your IOU's from the government. Of course at some point the IRS will not stand by while losing out on billions of tax lost to people only using crypto. At that point The Americoin or what ever they call it will be released. Once that happens they will consider bitcoin as counterfeit currency. Then all exchanges will be considered illegal. Since they will have complete control over Americoin you won't be able

That you live in a shitty dictatorship.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:11:37
well why do you think they are planing to replace the dollar with a crypto that is centralized highly traceable and regulated. There will be a very short period where you will be able to exchange dollars for the new crypto. Anything about a few thousand will be scrutinized and anything about 10k will need to be handed personally by a federal agent who will review how and where you acquired such funds. This laundered money is lost tax revenue at some point.  There will be no hiding money from the feds with the Americoin.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:05:44
Yeah right. In reality it looks like the Libra logo. They would never replace the dollar with bitcoin. They will replace it with a highly regulated highly traceable centralized crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:14:24
it was only a mater of time before the government took crypto serious and identified as a threat. All that lost tax revenue. Did people really think that a government with decades of experience in taking down foreign economies and overthrowing regimes would have any trouble doing the same to the crypto market.  When you threaten the us dollar we straight up kill your ass. Just look at Saddam Hussein. He was about to begin selling oil using the EU currency, not the US dollar. next thing you know... BOOM! SHOCK and AWE. Give it some time and a US standard crypto coin will come out and it will be the NSA's wet dream. Taxed completely traceable and regulated. Until then the crypto market will be a unstable mess. Decentralize all you want. It is only worth what people perceive it's worth.   
P.S. I have some conspiracoins if anyone wants to buy em. Only 10$ a coin.

Welcome to non regulated,backed,insured currency. Now that Bitcoin is really starting to take off Do people really think corrupt people won't start to take advantage. Not to mention government's can at any time come in and really start to screw with things. The US government has had decades of experience manipulating economies. Anyone that thinks that crypto currency can't be regulated is fooling themselves. If the government can't find a way to regulate it. They will destabilize and destroy it.

not only is it real. The police station actually gets to keep a portion of it. If I am not mistaken the judge also gets to keep some. If we the people don't exercise our second amendment soon. We will loose the rest of them.

Who said we wouldn't be using drones. Or just guns for that matter. This is the US government we are talking about here. You could do a lot of damage with a laptop as well as other tools. Then you have to consider that not every soldier in the military would just follow orders to fire on citizens. It would probably take a single drone strike on American citizens for majority of the population to revolt. Not to mention people said the same thing about our military and the Viet Cong.

that is until the government and the banks release a crypto to replace the dollar. Then pass a handful of laws and regulations that will make it all but impossible to run a crypto exchange that isn't owned by the banks. Sure they could operate outside of the US, But since they will have complete control of the Americoin they will have ways of either stopping the transfer or will have ways of knowing you bought non standard crypto and charge you with with possessing counterfeit currency.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:07:07
This is not going to last long. This is the work of the big banks. They have the funds to pump it up like this at will. They will soon crash it around 15-20 again.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:27:46
Better get used to it now. This is only the start. They will soon replace the paper dollar with a centralized highly traceable crypto. Probably call it Americoin or something. When that happens have fun buying bitcoin, because They will declare that possessing non regulated crypto is the same as possessing counterfeit currency which is a crime. There will be no exchange that will be allowed to operate legally as they will be marked as counterfeit or money laundering operations. But we have some time before that happens. But it will happen. Once America does it the others countries will follow suit. Also anyone that dares try to make the Americoin not the standard will be met with the same brutal fate as *Saddam Hussein and Gadhafi . We don't take kindly to countries that try to out the dollar as the standard. We will kill you for it.*

give it time. their plan is well under way. This guys is just a pawn.  The end game of the puppet master is replacing the us dollar with a highly regulated and very traceable crypto. it will make it much easier to catch tax dodgers and people trying to hide their money. You can buy anonymous crypto. But seeing as you will have to use the new American standard crypto to purchase it they will still know you where your money is going. Once this happens they will use their might to make it so any business that wants to use the new crypto banking system will have to report any user that uses any other crypto. By the time this is out they will have convinced people to chip them selves. Most likely with the help of Apple and Samsung. Then they will be able to track everything we do.

Sorry this happen to you but this is why FDIC insured fiat will be just fine for a long time.

ha ha silly people. You let the politicians run wild and now we get to pay for it. They will pass this and you all have no say what so ever. It is only a matter of time. Eventually they will attach it on the back of some other bill and it will pass under the cover of darkness. Just like when Paul Ryan attached a massive spying bill to the omnibus spending bill. They will find a way. Now the real question is this. At what point will people realize that politicians on both sides are killing this county and rise up and take it back. Because when we do having bitcoin will be a handy thing. They know this. That is why bills like this are being railroaded though. Because when it does happen anyone found to be a part of the resistance will have their bank account and assets frozen. Crypto is a threat to their control system.

LOL. You might want to check the price when you get up. Because it's not going to be at 14k.
@_date: 2019-04-19 02:46:20
having to worry about losing your money is not a good thing. Just ask the many people that have had their coins to thieves.
@_date: 2019-04-18 04:25:09
Sound maybe. But it is still not FDIC insured.

He clearly is not. Because if he were it is very easy to prove it. Create a new wallet. Then transfer all the money from Satoshi's wallet to his new one. End of argument.

perhaps one of those kids will take this home then load it up with malware and leave it in a parking lot somewhere. Then once the mark infects his pc the kid steals his info and sells it. Once he has the money he buys all the candy he can eat. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:05:26
Any police station complaining that this will really hurt their budget should be immediately investigated. The whole thing should be thrown out. It is unconstitutional and should not be allowed at all. If we make it so we have to convict a person you know the greedy police agencies are not going to stop. They will most likely just start fabricating charges. so now instead of the small business owner getting screwed over and having his money stolen, he will then also get charged with some crime that they didn't do.

Gee i bet this is what JP Morgan said about Tesla's wireless power as well. Except they can't kill bitcoin like they killed wireless power. I hope JP Morgan is burning in hell and his shitty company goes bankrupt.

the government won't ban bitcoin. That would only make people want it more. What they will do is employ the CIA to do what they do best. the CIA decades of training on manipulating economies and governments around the world to make people not want to use it. Just wait they will let it get back up again. Then another crash. After 10 or so heavy crashes people will loose faith and move on. about that time the Americoin will come out and replace the dollar. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:08:21
does anyone else think that there is a chance that the people behind the attack not only did it to get bitcoin, but also to inflate the price at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:27:19
yeah the amazon times is usually wrong.

come on everyone if we hurry up and buy a coin now we still have time to lose over 3k. If you don't you are going to be one of those chumps that will only lose 2k per coin.  
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:41:06
Better dump it around 15k. This wave wont last as long as last time.

you do know how insurance works right. Having insurance doesn't make you lazy. Or are you really blaming people that stored their coins somewhere that should have been safe only to have their money stolen because it got hacked. How is wanting to have an assurance that your money is safe being an Americant. I will make it easy for you it isn't. That's being smart,
