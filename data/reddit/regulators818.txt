Jeez what a community we got here on Im not hoping someone knows every banking protocol but the fact that I am using one of the top 3 banks, maybe someone came across something of that sort. 
It will definitely help to be more open minded about it rather than get angry. I asked a simple question. If it doesn't pertain to you, just skip it. Either you're whoring out for Karma points or you're just a negative person. According to your username, its probably the latter.

You mean just get them out of coinbase vault or out of coinbase in general?

You have more to gain by holding rather than trading. Imagine if 15 years down the line, bitcoin is worth 20k per bitcoin?

lol good luck timing that one

Dude relax. This is the beginning of it. That's like you saying "I dont know why anyone will use the internet" back when it came out. With time, things settle into place. With competition, people move faster to get things done and make sure they work right. You're apart of building the foundation of cryptocurrencies. 
Relax, it's all new. If you leave now, you will be back.

I had tried that multiple times too. No luck
@_date: 2016-11-22 07:02:14
I did. It's right.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:36:12
LOL damn. Didn't even think of it like that. Crazy

I heard Goodwill is opening up a section in all of their stores for items with BTC left inside of them.

Can you tell me which one is a hardware wallet? What are some good ones. Like I said earlier, I am a complete noob at this.

What processor you use?
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:51:00
Aww thats interesting
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:01:19
Japan and SK will be more open to it. They're leading in technology and innovations in the everyday world so it makes me think that they will be open to this. Japan already legalized it as a currency.

Isnt bitcoinway the processor? I use bitpay and looking to use something else.

This is a serious issue if Bitcoin wants to be scalable. Wifi/Internet makes it a big problem.

So how does price fluctuate when its sold rather than when its used to purchase something?

Every 210,000 block, Bitcoin goes through a halvening which means the block reward is decreased by half. Bitcoins next halvening is in 2020 and it will drop the block reward down to 6.25 Bitcoins which is currently at 12.5. Bitcoin has an average inflation rate is 4.03%. There are an average of 1,800 bitcoins being mined per day (144 blocks per day) with a total of 4.3 million more to be mined, which is about 21% of what’s left. Pre mined coins are coins that were placed into a wallet without even needing to mine them yourself. Some altcoins can be premined but this kills the idea of decentralization.

Wont it be cheaper to have stocks of btc to avoid bitcoin fees?

When one bitcoin is worth $10k+ and you're still hodling: "Oh We Live! Baby!"

Thats not true. I see a lot of porn videos titled "She loses her virginity" so you obviously don't have to pop your cherry before you become a porn star. /s

I understand but I am talking about this sub specifically. It has 230k readers that come here for their main bitcoin news. I consider this sub more trustworthy than many other bitcoin news places. Not that other places are shady but because the community here is more helpful and knowledgeable in general.
