Why am I the only one who thinks this is an awful idea?  If you want to gamble just play poker.  The only difference between this and poker is your perceived control over the odds and your familiarity with the platform.  Everybody would just be really greedy and nobody would care to browse the site or give up-votes.

I recently used bitinstant to convert cash to bitcoin.  There are a couple ways to do this but I used one of the store locations.
They charge 3.99% commission, plus a zipzap fee of $3.95, and the conversion was around 20 cents / bitcoin more than the Mt Gox exchange rate (which is itself higher on average than other exchanges).  The zipzap fee doesn't actually go to bitinstant, this is the company that sends bitinstant your money.
Overall it is a great way to buy bitcoins.  I bought $25 worth and after all the fees ($28.95 total) I managed a rate of 1 bitcoin / $15.66, which isn't that bad (assuming you just want a couple to play around with).
The really annoying thing was the deposit process.  After printing off your info you have to go to an address listed [here]( which can be anything from a walmart, to a CVS, to a 7-11.  I don't think it matters which one you select on their site because they forward you to this other site to process your payment.  You then have to use this red phone in the store to call some guy in India, where you hear a really long warning about Internet scams, and then give the guy on the other end a bunch of information (including your address, name, and ph  although you could in theory make all of that up), and then once that's all done you get in line and pay the total amount to the check out person.  I think the lady was supposed to verify my ID but I guess she forgot, so it's probably a good idea to use your real name (and also bring your ID).  They give you a receipt, take your money (it has to be cash), and magically bitinstant gets that money, minus the $3.95 fee that zipzap takes.  They then pay you bitcoins *right away*, it's basically instantaneous.
An easier way might be to use the bank deposit method, which is an extra $1 fee over the 3.99% commission, but a bank will probably be less hassle cause you wont have to stand in a store and talk to someone over a phone.  The bank method may or may not charge an extra $3.95 fee so even though there's that $1 fee listed on bitinstant's site it might actually be cheaper.

Actually what happens is `af38ee...` is turned into a mnemonic.  The algorithm it uses can take any hexadecimal number and convert it into "words".  In the case of electrum it first generates a random seed, then converts it into the mnemonic.  So `af38ee...` does in fact resolve to an Electrum wallet and in this case your mnemonic is,


You can in all liberty import any sha256sum into Electrum but the addresses are going to be different than what you'd get using the simple brain wallet method.  For example `af38ee...` resolves to address 1Kf2MSia4gxMrAnTdW8XLZA1Lna6VdJrRR, which is not part of the electrum wallet represented by the same hash.
The same mnemonic converter can be found at  using the "poetry" field.  It is the same algorithm because electrum gives you the same mnemonic.  If you play with it some you'll see how changing a single characters will change a couple of words in the mnemonic.
Granted I would not recommend using this little hack unless you absolutely know what you're doing.  Probably some people do create electrum wallets this way, taking shasums of insecure keys, and they can lose their coins similarly to regular brainwallets using the same insecure keys.  Electrum generates a random hex and then gives you the mnemonic so human error is left (mostly) out of the equation.

Someone posted about it on reddit -- actually is responsible.
This address, which he sent dust to, represents an illegal number: 
Despite being base58, the decimal/hex representation is what's used internally on the blockchain (although it probably doesn't matter how the number is represented).
The actual number 09f911029d74e35bd84156c5635688c0 is "owned" by the MPAA.  Apparently in 2007 this number showed up on digg and they tried to shut down the website.  Relevant information here:

Except you could trade as usual and withdrawal funds the only thing is that it took longer (cause it was manual).
It's more likely people were moving fiat *out* of Gox at levels that hadn't been seen before, right after the bubble etc, and this caused the banks they were using to buckle under all the pressure.
That actually makes sense if you value any kind of logic.
Note that a sell doesn't mean that money goes to a bank someplace; people hold fiat on Gox, so this news and the previous news likely had very little effect on prices (except to the extent there were rumors that Mt. Gox was having legal problems, which seeing how that's clearly not the case, this can only be positive news).

There is a market, and that market is gamed.
Case and point: credit rating agencies.
Anytime you can pay a presumed "neutral" 3rd party to make your own product look better there's a chance for it to be gamed.  This even happens with your basic consumer review companies, stuff like *car and driver* (I don't know about that magazine specifically but I've heard of consumer review companies like *car and driver* having longstanding, obvious biases towards certain brands).
Note -- your post was all kind of off topic so I'm not entirely sure how it related to what I was saying originally

That's all well and good but to add sentiment above, if you study the history of banking and the nature of what banking is, there is a natural progression towards an insurance based system to stabilize banks over larger geographic areas.  We had federal reserve based systems in the united states for over 100 years before the actual federal reserve.  We just had them on a state-wide basis instead of a national basis.  Every state had its own currency and banking system develop organically out of the free market with it's own state bank and branch banks inside the state.
Contrary to the mantra repeated by a lot of people the 1900s were an incredibly stable period for banking in general.  Banks used to fail every decade or so during the 1800s, under a gold standard, state by state, often as a result of new gold mines in California or new silver mints in France (that created shockwaves across the world, causing economic problems, bank runs and ultimately bank failures the likes of '08 but literally every other decade).  Leaving the gold standard and creating a nation wide insurance system, as an objective fact of history, has led to a remarkably stable period of history in comparison.
Also FYI one of the largest problems in '08 was a shadow banking system -- essentially private companies pretending to be banks but not regulated as such.  Their activities as unregulated banks destabilized the rest of the legitimate banking system.  Quite similar to what happened back in the 1980s during the savings and loans crisis (again, private companies pretending to be banks but not regulated as such).
But of course this long bit of actual history and actual facts is much harder to digest than "the entire world is out to get you; no matter where you go there is a national banking system working against you."

Germany was the first country ever to introduce a national health care plan and other "little guy" ideas such as pension plans and worker rights.  This was during Germany's early golden era under [Bismark](
Note he was a conservative and his ideas were quite different from socialism (a distinction lost to a lot of people).

Lag is ~25 minutes, constant, and downtime is ~16 hours per day plus weekends and holidays.
I mean I get it's not really the same issue that MtGox has, being that at least these numbers are in fact *stable*, but they work in a fundamentally different way from MtGox.  MtGox is online 24/7 and orders are completed typically in 1 second.  NASDAQ is offline and there is a 25 minute or so waiting period between when you place an order with your broker and when you find out if or at what price your order got filed.  Not a bad thing just point it out for people who don't already know.

Buyers also get ripped off.
Sellers watch the market and will cancel a deal if the price of bitcoin climbs too close to the price the auction ended at.  So if you get a good deal (ie close to market price) on bitcoins, prepare for the seller to arbitrarily "renege" you.

In your example HFT would be like best buy placing an add for a band new $1,000 flat screen TV for $100, having exactly one TV in stock, then walking over to Target to "price check" their $1,000 TV at $100.
The next day when their deal is over best buy now has hundreds of $1,000 flat screen TV's for sell at full price that they took from Target because of a false price check.

The key is actually given out by the MPAA to companies producing DVD software, similar to a trade secret.  It is a felony in the US to use css descrambling to watch your legally purchased DVDs on your legally purchased DVD player using non MPAA approved DVD software.  This includes open source DVD software and is why most linux distros don't ship with encrypted DVD playing ability (until you go to play a DVD and it asks you to download the software, because now you're the one breaking the law and not the linux distro itself).
So yeah it is basically the same thing but you can see where there was a double standard about who was supposed to know about the number and who wasn't -- if you paid the MPAA enough money they'd give it to you, otherwise you weren't supposed to have it.

Bitcoin shows up in *Bloomberg* fairly often.  This is second, maybe the third time I've seen it as one of their big articles.  It was also on the cover of the August 25 issue (the one featuring an interview with bill gates) and I think it's been on other covers before that issue as well.

I think you're off by about 5 months.
Although I do think we'll see the bottom sooner than the last cycle just cause everyone expects it and there isn't the same fear that bitcoin could hit zero or sub 1 dollar (though lots of people think a 50-&gt;30 run is possible).
The last bottom also saw *months* of sideways movement which honestly I think would be great.

You might make less as an "investor" than you'd think.  Just because the house edge is 1% with 5% commission doesn't mean your BTC will get 1% (*0.95%) return overtime.  It depends on how many people play there as a ratio to how much is invested.
It's also possible for the site to go negative over entire month periods (see: Satoshi Dice).  I just don't see a BTC investment "making" very much on that site.  When you consider that you're trusting the site wont get hacked or run off with your money you're probably just as well off wagering a couple bitcents than becoming an investor.
Just out of curiosity what kind of returns are you seeing OP?

**Around 90% of all Linux kernel developers (as a function of code volume) are hired and paid professionally (sources include AMD, Intel, Nvidia, IBM, Hitachi and Fujitsu)**.  This idea that nobody gets paid to write open source code is a common myth that ignores the incentive for large companies to invest in open source.  Open source allows companies to be more competitive and gets rid of the "contractor problem"*. 
*Where company A hires a contracting company to write a piece of software, say for $10 million, and company B in the same industry hires the same contracting company for the same kind of software but pays $1 million -- using open source everyone, including your competition, spends the same amount of money for the same results.

This also goes back to my first point, invalidating parent.
These *huge* companies were caught lying, causing a huge controversy and making national news taking bribes to boost the ratings of other companies and yet they're still in business.  People still use them and they still make billions of dollars.  This idea about "reputation" is nice in theory but in the real world it rarely proves itself accurate.

Old pre-crash numbers were 51% SDICE, ~12% SR.

I took a couple data points on the stats page and got these.
    Time    Profits    Investors
    10:57 1,733.34,  ~25,610
    11:17 1,734.38,  25,653.42851899
    11:47 1,743.20,  25,724.339
    12:07 1,745.26,  25,743.21553199
So in 30 minutes the BTC invested grew by 71 and their profits grew by 9.
Ballpark estimate is 72~432 BTC / day profits and 3600~3192 / day investor growth.  Right now 1 BTC will earn 0.0028 ~ 0.0168 BTC per day which is consistent with what you said (0.010833333 / BTC / day profits, puts site profits at ~252 BTC / day).
So it looks like a get rich scheme and you might make something getting on early but after about a month I expect investor profits to decline dramatically.  Profits might increase but investors will increase much faster.  At current rate in 30 days there will be ~133,000 invested BTC meaning even if profits double, your return will be 500 / 133,000 = 0.003759398 / day, getting worse every day / week / month...
I still like the idea of course I'm just trying to run some numbers before throwing money at a random website that could always get hacked etc.
For comparison, ROI on SDICE right now is 0.000561167 / BTC / Day (which might be where this site levels off after a couple months, will take longer to tell of course).

That could also be because they're converting local currency to USD / YEN / whatever to buy bitcoin and the extra fees for converting fiat drive prices up.
I know paypal isn't the best metric but they charge like 6%+ for currency conversion (both in conversion and the "fake" rates that are always higher than market price) and then you have to factor in the price of wire transfer and other miscellaneous fees.

Besides the early 90s we're only talking about Reagonomics (the savings and loans crisis) which was more of a late 80s thing.  Most of the 90s was smooth sailing, although in many ways we never recovered from the economic problems introduced during the 80s.


Yeah it bothers me when we go back to the failed policies of Reagonomics, horse and sparrow / supply side economics from the great depression etc just because nobody has opened up a history book or is old enough to remember these policies failing in the past.
