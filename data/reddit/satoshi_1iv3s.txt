Because each IOU is cryptographically signed. If you try to cheat protocol allows counter party to claim all funds you've funded channel with.
And since funding and closing of the channel are still on chain transactions you ensure that there is no double spending in Blockchain.

It is legacy clusterfck... kilobyte (kB) SHOULD be 1000 bytes and kibibyte (KiB) should be 1024. But of course as lots of stuff in programming it's shoulda-woulda-coulda... so in some systems kb is 1024 in some it's 1000 bytes .
In Bitcoin Core code 1000 bytes = 1 kB.

They are the heroes we need.  We only live in this modern world because of people like and who were driving the progress by giving away value they posses to enrich others.
Visiting crypto subreddits lately has been very depressing.  Nonstop conflict.  I wish there was a way to unite community around worthy ideas.  Like in the early days.  Sending 100,000s of Bitcoin for pizza.  Dreaming about time when 1 Bitcoin will be $10,000+.  We were not prepared.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:51:45
I think at this point nobody is disputing that fact - Bitcoin Cash being closer to original vision.
But doing what Roger is doing is simply - wrong. He is pissed at people for saying BCash, yet he has no problem saying stuff like "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin". Especially this move - to advertise BCH as "Bitcoin" to people new in space is bad &amp; sad.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:10
The sad part is that miners are the ones profiting the most from these outrageous fees lately.  $250,000 made with each block.
I'm sorry you disagree with my stance.  If you have time please read emails Satoshi exchanged with Mike Hearn (they touch on the scaling) and see if that helps with "original vision": 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:50:38

Don't worry friend... the only thing you can really do is try. I've been fighting that same battle for like 5+ years now. Funny thing is when in the same day you get called both Roger Ver and Blockstream sock puppet.
So, just keep at it and don't succumb to temptation to go full Mike Hearn. From one of the biggest Bitcoin believers to "Bitcoin will die in next month" guy.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:45:39
Conspiracy theory much? 
I strongly dislike Roger exactly because that guy is incapable of doing ANYTHING without trying to get something in return. Like it happened recently with Andreas.
So keep hating if you wish. But please stop trying to make it as if you have moral high ground or "noble reason" to do it. It'll be good for you... accepting that you're scared, arrogant ahole puts you in position to eventually change.
And maybe one day you WILL change. You'll come out and say: "I don't want to be an ahole anymore". Then we'll all hug, shed tears of joy and start singing together: "Roger, Roger what did you do? BCash, BCash pissed off you". Fun times.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:52
Come on man... what you are describing is 0.0000000000000001% edge case. You are saying ECC is "cracked" BUT somehow it takes "few hours" to derive private keys from public keys. So then mighty SHA256-RIPEMD160 comes to rescue with everyone on the network magically moving to fresh new wallets to hold the funds 4 hours at the time until devs hard fork with new, uncracked ECC. 
Yeah... we just need Adam Back and Roger Ver grabbing each other's asses and making out to complete that scenario.

The problem is that even with adjustment almost no miners switched to BCH. Take a look at data: 
Now, I'm not saying there isn't coordinated effort to pump BCH. It's obvious insiders had info on Coinbase launch. It's just that Bitcoin as technology should be resistant to stuff like this. Instead with 1 MB blocks it's very easy to spam mempool and pump alternative like BCH.

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:46:00
While you can't scale indefinitely... you can definitely scale beyond 1 MB blocks. As a programmer I can tell you that with current codebase you can scale up to 30 MB blocks. There have been numerous tests done and that's the limit... it mostly has to do with how multithreading accepts transactions into mempool. I personally would go with much gradual scaling though... even 2 MB blocks this year would've been invaluable in fighting spam transactions.
Because what you are currently seeing is definitely exploiting of 1 MB limit. As a miner all you need to do is "invest" $1000 per block into fees... and even with 10% hashrate it's very likely you'll profit longterm on fee increases.
In that sense I am very sorry that S2X compromise wasn't reached. 
Most of Core Devs (including Sipa and Vlad who do the most of coding anyway) supported block increase up to 8 MB... but over time for some reason that was abandoned in favor of 1 MB hardline stance. Sipa even did that 17.7% block increase per year proposal (google it, it's on github) that was supported by Vlad and even Greg.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:02
I think OP is just trying to find reasons to support his narrative of Satoshi being crypto genius. 
From everything I know about Satoshi and history of Bitcoin development double-hash was done not for "security" but because of smaller size. Wallet addresses are more compact when they are 20 bytes vs when they are 32 bytes.
(Of course Satoshi was crypto genius... it's just that SHA256-RIPEMD160 usage doesn't mean much in that context)
EDIT: Re-reading OP's post - just to clear something up:
~~There is no point in "protecting public key"~~
~~Public keys are made to be ... well... public. Public key is actually provided in plain format as part of the signatures when you are unlocking outputs for certain transactions. In that sense - again - **SHA256-RIPEMD160 is NOT "security" practice**. Choosing of secp256k1 curve is and I agree with OP there (I think even Satoshi himself talked somwhere that the reason why he chose that curve is because it's unlikely to have backdoors because of simple definition).~~
EDIT, EDIT: OK guys... if you insist - there are cases where hashing public key "can be useful" for security purposes. Again, I'm 100% sure Satoshi didn't use SHA256-RIPEMD160 for security (because early versions of Bitcoin locked by using public keys)... but previous header spawned lots of quality tech discussions... read replies to this comment and decide for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:55:45
Yeah, now that you mention it - it's quite interesting attack vector. You as a miner have transactions ready and include them in block you generate. So effectively you don't need to invest any money into it... you are just saying no to % of profits. And if you don't mine the block you just try on the next one. 
But as you make blocks even smaller and transaction fees keep rising... you'll make even bigger profits.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:06:22
Very. I wish we could put our differences aside and just support the shit out of these people. For example that guy that's giving 25 BTC as countdown to Christmas had only 20 (TWENTY) upvotes last time I checked his latest post:
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:20:55
I dunno man... I think both BTC and BCH camps have dedicated media snake oil salesman. And a ton of indoctrinated people who are invested into either BTC or BCH... so other side is always "literally Hitler".
As for developers... Bitcoin Core has publicly humiliated lots of former developers. And former devs are still suffering consequences of being publicly shamed for their beliefs and actions. Like Gavin - I do think guy made a lot of mistakes. The biggest probably being supporting CSW's claim that he is Satoshi. 
But Gavin now can't make a Twitter post without being crucified as idiot/shill/sellout. Concern trolling on Github issue tracker - just look it up... last year almost every day there was some kind of "world is ending" action by various developers. Especially during the whole NO2X movement.

However, at this point arguing against Lightning in Bitcoin developer community I am part of is simply not productive. It's been decided that it's the way forward, so I will use my knowledge to speed up the process as much as I can, instead of fighting losing battle and pissing off fellow devs with theoretical arguments.

I think they tried to ban Bitcoin mining. If you have links for Bitcoin itself being banned - please send them.
The problem with all these governments is that they get into this central planning mode... and then go mad when their schemes get exposed for how stupid they are.
Like Venezuela subsidies electricity prices... so ofc you have crypto mining boom. And then when govmt finds that electricity is spent by miners (instead of "regular folks") - they flip out, start jailing miners and try to come up with new laws that will "prevent people from doing bad stuff and ensure system works as envisioned".
I never understood that knee-jerk reaction... if reality proves that you are an idiot, don't try to change reality... change yourself.

Yeah, you definitely need to tinker with it. But from my experience Electrum always sets the lowest fees out of all wallets I've tried out.
I wish there was super easy way to make this newb-proof. But unfortunately I don't think it is possible... you need full technical understanding how on fees work. 
The easiest way I've found so far is:
1. 
2. Look at where estimate for Delay says 1-X (if you are in real rush then first entry for 0-X)
3. Do it

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:39:33
Well either increased block size or second layer solutions (LN) solve the problem. Meaning you can spend $1+ million on electricity for block... if block somehow enables 100 million transactions than cost of each "true" transaction is $0.01.
I'm sure that eventually us devs will make it happen (like we did with the Internet). It's just question if that future currency will be Bitcoin or something else.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:52:10
Thanks for taking time to argument your view. It could be that I am too optimistic. I get that theoretically it is HARDER to crack SHA256 than ECDSA.
The reason why I say that public key is not security measure is that as far as I know you need to include public keys for signature verification. In first versions of Bitcoin Satoshi himself was actually using FULL PUBLIC KEY in locking script from what I remember (there were also things like sending BTC to IP address... but... let's not get there).
So - OK. I appreciate your viewpoint and am thankful you took time to argument it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:06
I'm in same boat like you, only that I started buying way earlier.

The problem with conventional banking is not only electricity used. But all other resources used. It's public secret that banks often balance their ledgers through manual work. So when you add up all the costs (and money printing) Bitcoin is by order of magnitude better solution.
The problem with Bitcoin however is that 99% of computation power is security measure... you are building this hashpower so that you can repel any malicious coordinated attack that would try to overtake Blockchain. It's probable that less than 1% of computation power Bitcoin has today is used for verifying or propagating transactions ("useful work").
That's how you end up with this crazy situation that ONE Bitcoin Block costs about $30000+ in electricity. And if one block costs that much and you only support 3000 txn / block - of course each transaction needs to cost $10+ for market to balance.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:50:23
Bitconnect didn't give you exact same amount of coins you had before fork. Bitconnect is not a fork of Bitcoin.
I am extremely sad that it seems extremists on both subs are winning. Roger claiming he is libertarian and then flips out about some irrelevant idiot saying BCash, BCash, BCash... or running those radio ads with "big bank Nazis (or patsies) running BTC".
I am equally sad about recent talk that Bitcoin is not for people earning less than $2 / day. Seriously people? That's what we've turned into? F**** elitists who will focus on calling each other certain names instead of working on solving problems? I've HEDL since early days and if you told me we will get here where we currently are... there is no way I would believe you.

Transaction only becomes smaller AFTER you remove witness data. So ideally for spam you would want multisig transactions that are huge in bytes, but their calculated weight become much smaller once you apply witness data discount. That way you also put strain on bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:17:04
I am realistic... anyone who believes that you can't use crypto if you are earning less than $2 / day never traveled around the world. Venezuela is great example of a country where Bitcoin can be used for tangible good. And people there are now in the "less than $2 / day" category.
Look at "Somalia mobile money" for example. Just google. You'll find tons of example like this.
When you do you'll see that all this bs talk we are having is wrong. We need to make Bitcoin usable for people around the world. I say that as someone who was living on less than $1/day as a child... and now is in Bitcoin million club with enough disposable income that I can HODL indefinitely. That's maybe why all this pisses me off so much - we are assuming that those people earning less than $2/day are somehow "less human" / impossible to include... where there is absolutely no genuine support for that theory. All that supports it is that guys like me who hold lots of Bitcoin don't care about paying $700 for transaction fees. I did that... sad to admit, but I paid $700 for single transaction fee. Really makes me feel guilty about participating in whole miner enrichment program. Maybe I should organize giveaway like to clear my soul.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:02:36


Looks pretty good... although I would make that Satoshi / byte value more prominent... move it to the top of the page. 
And you may want to open with some standard preset for people (1 input, 2 outputs)? Because I doubt anyone who knows difference between Regular and SegWit inputs needs tool like this... he already knows how much bytes his transaction is and then it's just txn_size * satoshi_per_byte_fee. Depending on whether or not txn is compatible you get that discount on witness data.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:53
LN can't come soon enough as far as I am concerned. I do believe that Bitcoin can be valuable as store of value... but it sure would be way more valuable if it was also medium of exchange.

To that end, here are links to help newbs:

What piques my interest here is that Dave Kleiman could be a piece in Satoshi puzzle. I've always wondered how CSW had the guts to go out and claim to be Satoshi.
I guess it could be that he knows that real Satoshi is dead so he moved in to claim that identity.
EDIT: To clarify one thing and hopefully reduce number of nasty replies - I very much dislike Particularly for his "patent efforts". It's obvious guy has experience when it comes to swindling others. But my emotions are one thing, reality is other. That said, it does become very hard to analyze data when you are dealing with known liar and tricker like CSW.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:59:36
Pretty much what says. But I understand your perspective also - you are right in a sense. The reason why I would like to see "real Satoshi" stand up is so we don't have to deal with guys like CSW. It would make a lot of things simpler.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:20:22
Luke is right here - bandwidth and CPU are the real problems. Plus with increased transaction count you would have faster expansion of UTXO set so memory would also be impacted.
I disagree on 300k/blocks though... would be way too restrictive. I wish that Pieter Wuille's proposal from 2015 on 17.7% blockchain growth was adopted. If it started back than and combined with Segwit we would've been OK long term.

You don't get any kind of "privacy" with your own full node. If you want privacy simply use Tor and get meaningful privacy.
And to which nodes your full node will connect? To exact same ones that you would otherwise connect with SPV. So there is ABSOLUTELY no meaningful difference.
Plus even if you have "full node" you do not "choose consensus". You PROPAGATE consensus established by majority hashrate. If that majority hashrate changes consensus the only thing you are able to do is get stuck on your own version of blockchain that you now can't advance because of mining difficulty.
I would LOVE if we had way to incentivize decentralization. But Bitcoin protocol - as it currently is - contains ABSOLUTELY no incentives for what you are talking about. Once Lightning Network is running - THEN - we can talk about value of having full node at your home that has your private keys loaded in memory monitoring your channels 24/7. We will also be able to talk about how Bitcoin is not for people who can't afford 50-100 GB of bandwidth per month. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:58:30
Ah... so argument is that someone will monitor your SPV TOR traffic and then piece it all together. While with full node since you'll request more information you have this security by obscurity.
So what is this setup we are talking about? Full node on Tor... but your wallet connecting to your Tor full node - is it also on Tor? Direct connection? VPN?
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:50:05
I dunno man. In this paranoid scenario how you connect to your node also matters. Because if connection between your wallet and node is observed - it's trivial to figure out your addresses.
did interesting pull request for "full block SPV node" that I see is part of article you linked. I really think this is all artificial add-on that gives people excuses to push BS narrative. How you mix your coins is much more important for privacy vs whether you run full node or not.
But, who I am to tell people what to think. If you are really buying this "it is SOOOOO important to run your own full node" BS... then... fine, I guess.

Well, to be honest - I took offense because I've actually withheld a lot of information I've uncovered over years, exactly because I didn't want it to spread.
But looking at this thread... seems like it's inevitable. People like you and me may value privacy... but we are in minority. Plus what really, really pisses me off is that since real Satoshi is unknown we get guys like CSW to hijack the position.
Anyways, I'll just go now... do something more meaningful with my day... Enjoy your day too.
