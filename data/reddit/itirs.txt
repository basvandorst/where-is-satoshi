Do they give you a bitcoin transaction id?

The basic reason for this isn't Coinbase but the limitations of the Bitcoin network. The problem with Coinbase is that they don't let you choose your fees and instead go for super-high.
If you don't care about transaction speed, in many cases you can do just fine with 5-10% of the fees they decide for you.

But same end result. What matters is the whole of the ecosystem. The barrier to entry is still there, which is a pity.

No, but I think the estimations for realistic blocks were 40-50%.
On second thought, taking the above into consideration, 40% adoption more or less fits almost-20% witness size.

Yeah, I know about the 4% fee. But is there no immediate purchase available up to a small threshold, like $100 or so?

Trying to find an easy and smooth way for a newcomer to join in. 
For a few dollars, if they had to send photo ids, link bank accounts, wait for days... not a good introductory.

Haven't they fixed that by now? Or didn't they start only accepting debit cards?
But if it's impossible to purchase immediately after registering than it's anyway moot.

Though the Witness part size is still lower than 20%.

Thanks. Though, I was hoping to find something friendly for casual newcomers.
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:57:09
Well, by the looks of it now, I guess crypto is still not for casual users.

I thought some still didn't require it until after you cross your initial $100-200 threshold.
