You need the address from pubkey?
bitcoin.ECPair.fromPublicKeyBuffer(new Buffer(dec.split(" ")[1], 'hex')).getAddress()

YES! I'm so tired of devs being such pussies about putting stuff on mainnet.

Someone should make a website where you deposit bitcoins to get bitcoin IOUs. Then you send/receive those IOUs rather than real bitcoins. When you are done with million micro transactions you convert your IOUs back to real bitcoin. Scaling solved.

Because the reason to use altcoin is not reason to hold altcoin so the altcoin has low security so no reason to use altcoin.

Evidently he is too triggering to ignore. Just like Trump. Let's hope this is not a democracy.

But why she agreed to do the interview in the first place? She wanted to set the record straight? lol!

But the shit is still worth 1 billion. Given the rekting that happened it is pretty amazing IMO.

2 years and haven't sold any but time to be sane before the rest.

Oh boy this is weak bull trap. Easiest pattern in a while. Down to 630 we go until next year and then its nuclear lauch to 3000 or else cryptocurrency winter.

Yes let's bump the limit because of manufactured debate that increases my cortisol levels.

BCASH BCASH BCASH! Hmm I'm actually marketing bcash now... How hard is it for bitcoiners to not get triggered and just STFU? Shame on you all.

Mimblewimble has the best blockchain design. This makes it especially good for women.

Yes this guy is high iq narcissistic psychopath who infiltrates technical communities and fcks them up. The other day he was hugging Adam Back and spending time with Wuille. It's scary because these technical geniuses are little blind to manipulators like Emin.
But telling people to sell bitcoins is whatever.

dude... do you even hodl?
@_date: 2016-10-14 09:23:29
Hah yeah. I'm just gonna shut up now. I guess bitcoin was actually kinda natural "next thing to do" given all the ideas bouncing around in mailing lists. Also lol at Peter Toddler forgetting ever having these discussions.

Thx dude I finally get bitcoin price movements. Seriously good explanation. This feels like the correct depth of recursion.

It would be cool if you could solve dumb contracts smartly. But that takes stroke of genius usually (satoshi). Just throwing them on ethereum and pretending you solved the problem doesn't cut it.
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:36:37
This sooo much. While most used smart contract is 1 of 1 multisig my favourite is the ridiculously epic 2 of 2.

Just file this under 'people are irrational'.
