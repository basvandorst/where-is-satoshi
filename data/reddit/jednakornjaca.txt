ACH is Automated Clearing House. Basically how American wire/cheque transfers (with routing and account numbers) are processed. Like the EU's SEPA but slower.

Use bitaddress.org (on a computer running a LiveCD that's never been connected to the internet for extra paranoia points). Send coins to the generated address and then paste the address into blockchain.info to see its balance.
When you want to spend, create a wallet account on blockchain.info. Somewhere on the tabs where it says "My Transactions," "Send Money," "Recieve Money," etc. there is one that says "Import / Export." Go into that one, find the box where it asks for a private key, and paste it. blockchain.info will import the address and allow you to use it as normal.

Are you kidding? The fact that you're willing to blatantly generalise and say that leftists hate freedom definitely reflects more on your hate than it does mine.
As another user brought up, my views on private and public property have nothing to do with hating freedom. Moreso, I think that capitalism, with it's inherent hierarchy, is freedom-hating.

Saw this video in economics class: 
Bitcoin caters *a lot* more to Austrian economists, American "libertarians," and anocratic capitalists. I've seen a bit of hate for Keynsians here, and don't DARE mention leftism or you will get shit on.
**EDIT:** Part 2 of the video:  I know they can be painful to watch but I found them hilarious and might help a bit.

Then you'll be okay. The general people here tend to say that selling is a guaranteed loss, and you should hold.
What price did you buy in at?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:00:48
16 years old high school senior.
I bought in for real investment at $63; however I quickly sold half of what I had back at 230 and rebought at 110. Today I fucked up and decided I had enough at $68, so I still made money. Now I bought back in at 80-something (basically I could only buy back 75% of what I had because of my quick selling) and am moving my coin to a paperwallet.
It's been fun guys. I've known about Bitcoin since a month or so before the Adrian Chen Silk Road explosion in 2010 but haven't actually kept any until just recently.

What do we do when Asia wakes up?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:02:14
Wake up tomorrow morning and it'll be like this never happened.
I sincerely hope you did not sell.

Wow, another young person here besides me.
Nvidia GPUs are pretty shitty for mining compared to their AMD/ATI counterparts simply because of the chip architecture. 50 MH/s isn't really going to net you anything :(, and since you're paying for electricity, it might even lose you money.
If you want to mine Bitcoins, you have to have money and hardware.

Feeling pretty salty right now, not gonna lie.

AFAIK the only ASIC that has been shipped is the Avalon. The first 2 waves were sold out and shipping (someone that got one reported that it paid of in 9 DAYS [!]).
The third "batch" is going to be open to buy soon. The catch: instead of costing $1299 or $1499 like last time, the rumoured or official price is now going to be 88 bitcoins. I for one do not have that kind of money to gamble.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:30
Where the hell do you guys come up with this?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:12:51
Yup, after buying and selling for a long time I got in for real at $63.
The other day I sold a small amount for $230, and then I managed to put all of that money back in to BTC when it was at $110. Here's to it going even higher than $250 this time around. ;)
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:31:57
Addresses are public and private key pairs. Every address has a "secret signature" of sorts (called the private key) that allows you to spend whatever coins are associated with that address. 
In essence, that's what you're backing up. Lose that key and the address is fucked.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:33:32
It's not an everyday thing, I promise. :P
But yeah, waiting for a network confirm to go to an exchange, especially when you feel like you have to sell RIGHT NOW, is a bitch.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:12:22
Ugh and after an hour of sending a transaction there's only been 1 block mined... so I can't move by BTC to an exchange. :/
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:00:47
The topic doesn't even make sense, man.
I hope you realise that there is a huge US government agency that was CREATED in part to fight counterfeit USD. The amount of effort that gets put in to finding people who do this is unbelievable.
Banks will certainly not eat any losses, there is no way you'd be able to pass a counterfeit bill at a bank.
And yes, you can't counterfeit bitcoins, so it's better than fiat in that aspect.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:10:55
You're right, I don't. Neither do any of the "libertarian nutjobs" I'm talking about, but that's a pretty good point. I'll edit that part a bit.
**EDIT:** You're talking about the taxes thing right? Ah screw it I'll remove the whole thing.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:40:43
Hi. I'm a 16 year old. I like the idea behind crypto, am not a raging libertarian (well I've some pretty staunch leftist-anarchist sympathies, so for all intents and purposes here I'll lump myself together with the ancaps), and have bought drugs online using Bitcoin like 3 times. If you're twice as old as me and calling yourself "the next market," what does it make me?
I'd like to reiterate what everyone here says: Bitcoin is in its infancy. This should explain a lot of the things like it being hard to buy, not a *ton* of ways to spend it (although that is changing quickly, especially if you compare it to 2 years ago). As it becomes more and more known, there is going to be more and more effort to remedy these problems.
Also let me say that you have all right to be scared about the hard driveless laptops and live Linux installs. While I believe a lot of that is over the top, you have to remember that Bitcoins are basically internet cash. Don't wave your wallet around too much, be wary of handing it to others (i.e. Instawallet), and protect it.
The system really isn't that complex though, come on man. Read about change addresses (it really takes 2 seconds to understand), and figure out how the network works (miners mine blocks, higher fee increases the chance of your transaction being checked by miners and added to a block) to understand transaction fees and confirmations.
You mentioned earlier that if merchants convert BTC to USD instantly, why not pay with USD? Bitcoins are both instant and irreversible, while with fiat currency you must pick one (bank transfer vs. charge card). At its core, Bitcoin is even simpler than using a credit card. If you wanna bring up libertarian nutjobs, there's also the "I control my own money" aspect; make of it what you will.
Do I make sense at all, or?
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:53:06
Sure, and I think that's an awful way to run things. As a leftist, I can still hate government, and it's possible that I do more than some other users of this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:20:43
I agree with you completely. I'm a child indeed, and yeah, I don't have shit compared to most other people, and as a result of that can't do shit. And of course Bitcoin has to be more user-friendly, etc. I just wanted to talk about some concerns OP has.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:04:42
That was almost instant! Wow, awesome. Sent you a $10 tip. :)

From my understanding, there is no currency conversion at all. I can wire in PLN to a USD card and it will be converted for free to your selected currency.
I think the different currencies are just to make travel easier, i.e. if a Polish dude is traveling to England where everything is in GBP, it would be easier to have a GBP card.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:52:39
Yeah. If you don't make new addresses, then you're okay since your old wallet.dat has the old addresses and old keys.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:04:22
It's because there was a 62 minute delay between finding block 231868 and 231869. Since your post, 2 more blocks have been mined, so you should have 3 confirms now.
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:59:50
Yes. They are cards issued from Bank Zachodni WBK (check it out [here]( in Poland. They can be registered anonymously (fake info over Tor) if that's your thing. You buy the cards either in USD, GBP, EUR, or PLN currencies and reload them via SEPA transfer.
They have strict limits. You can only add a cumulative $3500 to the card every year, and only pull $200 from an ATM per day.
You need to be in Poland to buy them (either in the bank or on a Polish eBay-equivalent) and are actually quite cheap. I've seen them for sale on a certain darknet hacking/carding forum for a bit of markup though.
@_date: 2013-03-25 01:25:13
Yeah sure. I was thinking of making a service similar to it anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-18 09:28:53
The server I used to play on (has had people selling in-game items for bitcoins since a year ago. The server is political and is very ancap-heavy (founder is also ancap), so it's not a surprise, but there was a lot of controversy about it. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:14


For example? That sounds pretty interesting and strange.

This actually happened already just last week. I fell into the bull trap and bought at 110 after the first day of the crash. Then it went up to 190, great! A day later it was all the way down to 60.

If you want to trade, use bitstamp.net. You'll have to do a SEPA wire to Slovenia but I love that website. 
Also, maybe try bitcoinnordic.com? Or does btcx.se still exist? Check those out, it might be faster for you but it's not a trading platform, only a way to buy BTC.

Most recently mined blocks are on the top of the homepage under "Home - Most recently mined blocks in the bitcoin block chain"
5 confirms now for you, how many do you need? Most exchanges require 3 or 6. 3 is reasonable, and I think after 6 the probability of doublespending is basically 0 unless you have &gt;50%. It's also the accepted value in the Bitcoin-Qt client.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:48:58
That's not how the network works at all. Coins are never actually stored anywhere. I read this somewhere:
It's like a fake world where a deity says "Okay, everybody now has 10 dollars!" When I want to pay you 2 dollars, I don't actually give you 2 dollars, because I don't have 2 dollars, just I have 10 under my name. I basically say "Hey guys, I'm JednaKornjaca and I want to send 2 dollars to ScaramoucheFandango" (broadcast the transaction) and I'll sign that with my private key. Then everyone in the world (miners) will see the transaction, check that it's legit, like I am who I say I am and that I actually have 2 dollars to spend, and it will be added (confirmed) into the next block of the permanent ledger (blockchain) that says who now has money.
Then, if someone wants to see how much money I have, they can check my address on the blockchain and they'll see I gave you 2 dollars, so I only have 8 now. But really, nobody physically has the coin, just those 2 dollars are now in your name and only your signature spends them.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:43:20
To clarify: Bitcoin-qt is still technically an online wallet, just it's online on your own computer, not some server.
True offline wallets are brainwallets and paper wallets.

To start: BFL is *nowhere near* shipping a product. It's simply not going to happen for a while.
That being said, if you pre-order now, you won't get one until *a very long time*. By then, lots of earlier adopters will have ASICs, the network's total hashing power will be way higher, and therefore the difficulty will skyrocket.
Buy one used after everyone gets one and realises they're not all they're cracked up to be.
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:55:43
You only need to make a new backup when you generate new addresses. As someone in a post a few minutes ago asked, basically in your wallet are your addresses and the keys that allow you to spend those addresses. If you make new addresses, there are new keys to go with it, and you need to back those up.
Transactions stay in the blockchain (go to blockchain.info/address/&lt;your address&gt; and check it out), all you need to back up is the secret key that gives you access to the address.

Hey, technically the payments are instant. Once something is broadcasted to the network it shows up there instantly. It's just that block mining is based on probability (for those less familiar with the blockchain, the first confirm is the transaction being included in a block, and every block mined afterwards is another confirm). The network tries to target so that one block is mined every 10 minutes, and that's usually how it works. Sometimes there are blocks mined within seconds of each other, sometimes (very very unlikely) it takes an hour.
P.S. You should have a 4th confirm now.
**EDIT:** Basically, broadcasting to the network (making the actual payment) is instant, just verifying the payment and adding it to the permanent ledger takes ~10 minutes. For people that want to be 100% sure (more confirms exponentially decreases chance of a double spend), it'll take a few more ~10 minutes. Really though double spending isn't going to work unless you have a lot of hardware and really know what you're doing.
