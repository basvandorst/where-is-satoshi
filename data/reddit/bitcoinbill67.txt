Support the cause -

Ha ha - triggered you.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:09:14
Right, it’s like “oh no bitcoin is only up 1,100% for the year now. What am I going to do...
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:22:51
You import your private keys into the new wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:07:16
Get a wallet that allows you to see your private keys. The bitcoin core wallet for example is a good choice as long as your computer is SECURE.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:13:33
It’s still up 100% for the month. WTF. 
I’m starting a noob education fund:

Who in the hell would have thought that shitty exchange would have been the best bcash HODLer ever. Congrats to everyone who had BTrash locked up in CB. 
Support the cause.

Next question. Join a pool or not?
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:44:32
Last question (possibly). What mining rig to buy?  
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:55:24
That's funny bc this site  is the first result on google haha
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:13:00
No!  I'm the President of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:30:47
Hold and be strong. Watch a few Andreas videos and you'll feel fine.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:09:32
Good info everyone.  Any good pool recommendations. I'm not a BU supporter. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:46:40
The public ledger would be proof that proper support payments made to the appropriate parties.  No court orders no embarrassing trips to HR, etc.

Andreas 4 President 2020!

Keep the faith. My first coin purchased at $680 then I saw it go down to $200. Two years later more than doubled my original purchases. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:16:36
So all the posts about 0 confirmations after 1 day are bogus?  I'm testing it now $1.82 in fees - pending confirmation @ 12:13pst from Coinbase to external test wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:46:40
Yeah They've been basically down like all week
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:37:34
These coins are not competition 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:42:52
You are correct - 12:42pst with 3 confirmations. 
Thanks - I was being fooled by all the noise. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:45:50
It's to weed out the noobs who don't hold and panic. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:08:58
Not me
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:38:31
If you don't know maybe you shouldn't be in this space. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:00:54
Yes - don't use Paypal 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:04:48
If all the noobs are in panic mode and trying to get out of at same time then yeah every exchange is gonna have an issue but coinbase has been the worst
