Spending attracts more merchants (= more adoption). More adoption attracts more souls. :x --- edit: so basically sitting on your ass and never spending a single satoshi is not a good strategy. as a merchant, i won't spend my time setting up things to accept crypto.

A public ledger is exactly what a gov DON'T want. Not because they are concerned about *your* privacy, they are concerned about *their* privacy. It has to be a transparant, public ledger. Otherwise you can consider real world bank accounts.

Love crypto more day by day. They are panicking.

Did I miss something? Who told them the Chinese will ban all exchanges?

It's the end for you. I see an opportunity, because within a week or so we will reach the bottom. From that moment price will increase for sure because finally there is no more bullshit from China.

Agree. Also this. Everyone was waiting for 10K. Once broken we've hit 20K... So if we break one day 100K......

I can understand nobody likes such a prediction but 10K by EOY is a healthy progress.

To be honest. Every single Satoshi will be sold.

What do you mean by take the lead for once? America has taken the lead not so long ago.

2% is well worth mentioning if you are trading thousands of dollars. Crypto kiddies wants to see 50%+ gains so their   50 bucks become 75 bucks.

You're at the right path my brother.

Advice: Don't write down your seed in the right order. Your steel wallet will be useless if its stolen. Ex: If your seed is "home safe steel wallet" make it "home steel safe wallet". Just don't forget the order. You can also use the false seed by sending money to it and sweeping afterwards so the balance shows 0. This will fool the thief.

1 year ago I would say; no way you mofo. Now even 1 million doesn't sound unrealistic

I'm afraid if some gov's starts shutting down exchanges and making it impossible to buy crypto, we're pretty much fucked.
  edit: I'll give an answer to my own reply -&gt; we can avoid this with decentralized exchanges making it possible to do p2p fiat banktransfers (from seller to buyer). That's impossible to mute. Dev's should give this priority imo.
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:34:25
That's not a tax. That's theft.

Bitcoin Core doesn't work with seeds afaik. I prefer a wallet that works with seeds. If you want to backup your Bitcoin Core wallet you should eighter copy wallet.dat or you can extract your private keys. If somebody gets your wallet.dat, he/she can have access to your funds. You can always put it inside a password protected zip file.

Actually it's a good time to buy some more serious alts like Litecoin and Ethereum.
