A man was considering building a well by his house so that he could get water.
The well will cost the man much of his fortune to build.
The man is poor already and does not want to build the well if there's any way he doesn't have to.
The man hears that the nearby town is expanding their township to encompass his land... But that the town will be expanding their public utilities and a new water tower is being built.
The man finds out that the town will have water available in his area in 12 months.
It will take the man 2 months of hard work and 2 years worth of savings to build the well...
The man continues to borrow water from a generous friend from a few miles away for 12 months...

The format of the username also suggests significance of 'SGL' this is either a class a lab or building abreviation, possibly even a city or location.

I assume SGL is a class and they made this account in their 12th week of said class.
Those are assumptions based in small logical deduction and do not have extremely high probability of being 100% accurate.
However, I assumed Nats989 was a username they have repeated elsewhere, it was the case, or so it appears.

I just want to weigh in that credit card scanner sweeps are essentially this same thing, in that they intercept and double transactions on occasion in order to appear legitimate.
This theft was not crafty in any way on the part of the criminal and surveillance tapes should be able to pick them out. (Most restaurants are smart enough to have a camera pointed towards the register. Getting someone putting a sticker on it, shouldn't be hard even with crappy CCTV Cameras)
The only way to avoid this permanently is for people to have addresses as well as QR codes listed, and to maybe use an LCD screen with a fresh address each time, so no over-lamination can occur.

Volume transaction usage is also another elephant.
I've been running calculation against "coin market cap" versus daily transaction numbers in USD, compared against fiat equivalents of stored money, liquid money, and dead/unusable funds, vs everyday transaction volume.
Unfortunately, as much as we all love Bitcoin, it can afford to drop in value per coin and maintain the same USD volumes it's currently iterating, until Bitcoin sees more daily transaction for larger volumes of 'value' USD as the measure for the moment... We won't see major gains.
The only thing we have looking forward to pumping the market is the guarantee of deflation, VC boosts, and regulated exchanges at the moment...
Unless the Bitcoin experience is made easier, from obtaining coin to using it, people in general will stick to what's easiest.
Keep a credit card in the wallet, scan the credit card.
When Bitcoin reaches that ease of use with people's everyday merchants and retailers for in store purchases at brick and mortar, then we will see forced price rises over this type of news.

So if your Bitcoin amount in MtGox was greater than $10,000 in value at market value, then you held more than $10,000 in assets with a foreign institution.

Hi I'm Satoshi Nakamoto I hid a backdoor in the Bitcoin protocol that will allow me to destroy all the Bitcoins at once.
First person to roll a 12 in a post on 4chan decides whether I activate it or not.

Ask for signatures signed with the private keys that hold the coin.
If the signatures match to the public keys that show the wealth, they are solvent, because they have proven they have access to the private keys with the money.
If you don't trust signed signatures, then you can have them amalgamate and send all their coin to another internal address of their's proving they have control of the coin.
The transaction and balance will show on the blockchain, everyone knows they're solvent, we all win.

Relax, it's so exchanges don't hold them forever.
NY will hold them until the rightful owner comes to collect them.
It's to keep an exchange from owning some random guy's fortune over time because he kicked the bucket or something like that.

North Carolina man, I'm waiting for your arrival, until then I'll be using Trucoin anytime I go to South Carolina. (To buy fireworks probably, 500g fireworks are legal there, but illegal in NC, hence why so many fireworks stores are right on SC's northern border, haha.)

Ok what about services that are another layer on top of you, like Coinbase and Bitpay, where they maintain the wallets, but they have users underneath them?
How do you plan on differentiating a Coinbase address from a Coinbase user's internal Coinbase address?

So... It's measured relative to the currency or commodity that someone will trade for it?...
Which is literally what I said.

Let's theorize an idea to solve this problem.
What if you could have a key represent for example 10 bitcoins.
This key is separate from the private key that would normally represent them.
But by using this secondary key, it's possible to have the blockchain move these 10 Bitcoins from a new output not tied to the previous input.
The blockchain can then negate the old outputs and drop the coin available there to 0 based on the fact that the secondary key was used.
This would allow more fungibility and anonymity, but it would at it's core hurt the ideals of blockchain technology.
It would also alleviate the need for mixers altogether.
It would also quite possibly require a side chain to function smoothly.
It would absolutely require a hard fork were it to be implemented.
However, I like it.
Someone should try out an alt with a system like this.

Not really...
That's how exchanges have proved solvency many times.
If someone made an exchange that would prove it's solvency like once a day at a scheduled time so people could always see how much the exchange had, that would be really interesting.
solvex.io the exchange that you always know is solvent!
Proving solvency every day at 6pm EST!
Today's solvency proof will be a transaction to Public Address 1Bztoaf43gaARg3etc...

Mobile payments/credit card security are having to step up their game to at least match Bitcoin or people won't see the point in them.
et al. Google wallet, Apple Pay, and Credit Card companies trying to come up with ways to keep the key transaction secure.
These may not be fully disrupted by Bitcoin, but are definitely taking some influence from it.

Innodisk's 32GB MSATA drive
It's MLC so there's a chance your data FUBAR'd
However, it is supposed to have built-in SMART utilities and error checking redundancies.
In addition innodisk allegedly offers a 2 year warranty from invoice date on these bad boys.
Did you buy this MSATA by itself? Or was it part of an OEM computer?
If you bought it solo, innodisk might provide recovery services if you have a proof of purchase within 2 years.
(This drive is supposed to have 3 million hour MTBF)
If not, pro data recovery and/or swapping the data chip are going to be your only options.
Do any of the caps look burned? Crispy? missing?
Do you have a multi-meter to do some resistance/continuity tests across pins?

It's more likely than SHA 256 being broken by a quantum computer and all private keys stored on a quantum hard drive, so it's a "real risk" however, by the odds, you may want to go buy scratch offs if you think pools want to crash the very thing that's making them money.

If you don't have a ticker of the current donations on the site, people are more likely to think their donation is going into a black hole.
The more transparent this whole thing is, the more likely you'll get support.

This is one of Bitcoin's best bets at mainstream adaptation.
Money talks in America, and 4 million dollars for a Superbowl spot speaks for itself.
Now, before we raise all this money, someone please, please, get whoever you know with the NFL or ESPN and find out if they would allow a Bitcoin spot.
There's no use raising the money if we're just going to be barred at the front gate.
They don't HAVE to sell us the commercial space.

If not, use your gained knowledge to make a site like kickstarter, but Bitcoin related and you'll have something. (Assuming such a thing doesn't exist yet.)
