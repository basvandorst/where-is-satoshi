So in the last couple months there have been some big exit scams, on big platform . what if all does f... Just sold all of there crypto.which of course was NOT their scam coin or shitty ico presale scma shit. It was BTC XMR BCASH and probably all altcoins they accepted.... A lot !
From a logical standpoint of course they sell in a Bear market. They never believed in any blockchain technology. they just saw opportunities to make shit load's of money.
Bitconnects ponzi scheme has a couple guys at the top and in theory they made a lot.
 Im NOT talking about the YouTube guys they are just a faced and a really great instrument for them too !!! 
So if they all sell could this be enough too break the market even a lil ? 
So I'm normally more the reader guy but this questions really drive me crazy ! 
Does somebody know how much bit connect ever made ? This is important for my theory and I don't find anything about it !
Sry for my English and thanks for your attention !
