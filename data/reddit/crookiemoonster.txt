Electrum web app client.
@_date: 2012-09-27 06:21:17
Been thinking about this since WWDC. After researching it, there are two problems. The first is simply sending bitcoins. While it is possible, pass cards won't have embedded QR readers but rather App URL juggling or plain manual input.
Second and definitely the bigger set back is .pkpass files require an Apple approved certificate. This is not the same approval process apps go through but as far as I can tell, if Apple revokes this certificate there will be problems for the corresponding .pkpass files.
That being said, I think everyone should inform the electrum desktop developers because it would be a really good pairing.

The title is misleading.
It's around the last 5 to 10 minutes of the show and it's not that they prefer one crypto currency over the other per se. Rather the mining work is better implemented with Litecoin because it's a memory hard problem using SCrypt. This means it's future proof and ASIC's won't put a spike into Litecoin's overall hash rate unlike Bitcoin where CPU mining was out paced by GPU mining which was out paced by FPGA mining which will be out paced by ASIC mining which will be out paced by etc...

The point I think Dan was making is if a node is the first to broadcast a unconfirmed signed transaction, that node is the source (ip address) and one could see if multiple transactions have been signed with the same key(s).
IMO electrum and offline wallets makes this point insignificant. Plus an ip address is not a person.
@_date: 2013-01-18 09:34:26
I think he simply mislabels the situation. There will never be a true bitcoin bank with fractional reserve banking but he did say he's not an economist.
Now electrum does present an interesting path because the blockchain is held by servers which allow SPV clients to connect and verify rather than the client holding a copy of the blockchain itself. On the other, cartel mentality and MITM attacks could affect this model.

The criticism is around the exponential increase in hashing hardware performance. Die shrinks coupled with improved energy performance makes the hardware hash faster    while using less energy. But hashing was never designed to be hard, it was designed to be fast.
SCrypt was designed to be hard. That's why there is major drop off in mining performance using the same hardware. What would be making hundreds of millions proof of works per second with Bitcoin mining will only amount to tens of thousands per second with Litecoin. There is also a significant difference between the BTC and LTC difficultly levels.

I think there is some confusion. Slush's nightly builds simply clones the Github repo and builds a portable version of Electrum (in addition to an install version). They use to be featured on Electrum.org (with slush's sig). Slush even recently committed recently to Electrum on Github.

Not correct. Bitcoin is simply doing a one way hash function checking for leading zeros. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function designed to make it costly to perform large scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.

Here are some of the major points from the video:
- Bitcoin does not scale. Anyone can add extra data, unsigned, to blocks at the cost of some BTC.
- Bitcoin is not anonymous. One can create a script to connect to all the Bitcoin nodes and when they broadcast a new transaction, instead of relaying it, you know the source of that transaction. Thus one would also know the public keys associated with that source.
- When using Bitcoin over Tor, Bitcoin still accepts incoming connections.
- UPNP (Universal plug and play) or SSDP can be exploited to expose it and its associates to outside connections.
- Passwords suck. Passwords shouldn't be used to seed entropy for private keys. Common passwords lead to several people having the same private key.
- OpenSSL can be hooked to offer numbers assumed to be from a strong PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator) but actually from a malicious attacker.
- Network packets are being analyzed and not all packets are treated equally by either ISP's or other nodes on a network. Use Nooter.

Simply not correct. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function designed to make it costly to perform large scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory.

Simplified version
Supplies Needed: USB drive, TrueCrypt, Electrum Client, Encrypted Password File (LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, etc), Dropbox (Extra: [SecretSync](
First, using TrueCrypt, create a container file for the USB drive.
Next, mount the TrueCrypt container file, open the directory, add the Electrum client, and create a shortcut for the client.
Then, right-click on the shortcut, click properties, and add " -w electrum.dat" to the target.
Run the Electrum client for the first time with the shortcut. Add restore information to your password manager of choice and keep the password file in Dropbox.
Electrum also has an Android app.

Sure why not. Initially, I'm importing needed functionality and create an API instance variable for searching twitter. Based off where the user saves the script file, I check for two files (users.txt and addresses.txt). If the files exist, it reads the contents for later use else it creates the files.
Next, I create an empty array for the raw twitter search results, search twitter for the first 100 results, and store the results in the array. After that, I create another array with only the 'text' and 'from_user_id'.
Then I create a new string to store new addresses and begin filtering out repeat users and addresses. From the users.txt, I search for the 'from_user_id' from the search results. If not found, add it to the end. Next, tokenize the tweet and iterate through the words looking for an address match.
For an address match, I strip surrounding white space and check if the word fits the length of a public Bitcoin address in WIF. Then I check if the address leads with a '1' or '3'. Next, I remove all base58 characters from the word, check if the length of the strip word is 0 (meaning only base58 characters did exist), and search for the address in address.txt and newAddresses. If checks pass, add it to newAddresses.
Next, I create the post parameters called recipients by first checking if there are new addresses. If so, tokenize, iterate, and append " address ':' satoshis ',' " to recipients. Then replace the last comma with a closed curly brace. Next take the post url, append recipients in url encoded format, post, read response, store in variable response.
Finally, I check what happened in the response and write the updated contents of userIDs and addresses + newAddresses to their respective files.
