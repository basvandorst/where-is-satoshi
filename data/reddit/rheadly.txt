Here in the US at least, an outright ban seems unlikely.  What seems possible is a ban on exchanges, large scale mining, and businesses accepting it.  If this happened, the community would still be able to find a way to buy and use bitcoin, but it would scare many casual users off.

They can seize your exchange accounts, but not easily seize funds you had in a personal crypto wallet.  It's possible a judge could order you to hand over crypto passwords if they had some kind of proof that you had funds in a wallet and you could be jailed for contempt if you refuse.  It's somewhat similar to if you emptied your bank accounts into cash and buried the cash somewhere.  They could order you to hand it over, but they would have to prove that you still had it and that could be difficult.

In theory, if it keeps dropping, we'll hit a point where it gets unprofitable for big miners and some will start dropping out... we don't seem to have reached that point yet tho.  I suspect it would be more like the $4000 range.

Theory would hold more water if they weren't playing the Browns.

One of the big things that has been holding businesses back from accepting bitcoin is the price volatility.  However, they could instead  accept one of these "stablecoins" and not have to reprice their inventory every day.  If stablecoins became more popular, it could reduce the trade volume of bitcoin and drive prices down.

In general the IRS doesn't consider crypto to crypto as a "wash", so it's still taxable.  However, it's easier to trade crypto for crypto and remain anonymous if you wanted to avoid taxation and didn't care about legalities.

They're claiming FDIC insurance on the token, but I'm not exactly sure how that would work.

Mining is no more profitable for miners who started early than those who start today.  It's simple... price of BTC earned by mining new blocks minus the cost of running the mining rig.  Why would a miner spend say $4500 in electricity to mine a bitcoin when they could buy one on an exchange for $4000?  We're not there yet, like I said, but it could happen.

You can anonymously trade from BTC into USDT.  In general, it's difficult to directly exchange BTC into USD anonymously.

They shouldn't be able to freeze your Gemini$.  It's still just a crypto token on the blockchain and should be at least as free and anonymous as bitcoin.  The real risk is that Gemini folds and no longer supports the peg to the dollar... your tokens could quickly become worthless.

A question that occurred to me... seeing as bitcoin mining is getting increasingly concentrated into large operations, what happens if a majority of miners start voting to make changes to the rewards system to enrich the miners at the expense of the currency?  Increase mining rewards, cancel halvening, etc.   Would we hard fork?  How many miners would actually vote against something that would benefit them financially?

Mises is mostly garbage, but I'll take a stab at it.  He's basically saying that nationalists oppose the gold standard because it takes away the government's ability to control their own monetary policy.  In a war, the government has to borrow massive amounts of money and that tends to drive interest rates up.  In a fiat economy, the central bank can respond by lowering the interest rates that it charges banks, which pushes interest rates back down, In a gold standard economy, they don't have that option, making wars harder to fund.

Not sure this is a change.  China banned mining and exchanges, but I think it was still legal for private individuals to own and transact.

One has to imagine that Bitmain is the big loser here.  There should be a ton of used Antminers for sale soon.

You can claim it as a capital loss and use the loss to offset other gains or income or create a loss "carry-over" to offset future gains.

Well, I don't think there is any guarantee that it will go up again, but in theory, you could have a bunch of investors who are now watching and thinking "I'm going to wait until it hits $7k and then go all in".  And if they succeed in reversing the momentum, you would have people jumping on the bandwagon and it could shoot to the moon.  "Could"

I'm expecting a bounce soon up to $8.3k or so, but what the hell do I know.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:45:30
Buy at 7.5, sell at 8.3 is my completely unsupported recommendation.

I don't know who misled you, but uou can absolutely buy Tether with USD.

Lower, stable price is better for Bitcoin as a currency, but not for those who bought in as a get rich quick scheme.

The tweet he is retweeting says (in Chinese) "he lost more than 11 million yuan".  This is about $1.75M US.

Good if you like fast transactions and low fees.  Bad possibly as it seems to indicate lower Bitcoin usage.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:41:44
There is no technical reason that Bitfinex couldn't have just been creating Tether out of thin air and buying Bitcoin with it.  Now they promised that they would be thoroughly audited to prove that they weren't doing that, but then they fired their auditor.

I'm not getting rich quick like I expected so it must be a conspiracy.

The difficulty has already started falling.  [
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:36:53
If it falls low enough, some miners will drop out, but then the mining difficulty will be reduced which will reduce miner cost.  $5k is the US cost, btw... much cheaper some other places.

Might go to 100... might go to 1 million... you spin the wheel and take your chances!

Yes, Tether is tied to the US Dollar.  1 Tether token is equal to $1.  So each time you want to buy $1 in Tether, they "print" a Tether token.  There are currently 2.2B Tether, so in theory, they should have $2.2B in cash holdings.  Some people fear that they do not.  US regulators are investigating.

Futures price should generally be pretty close to spot price.  If they get too far apart, traders can profit by selling one and buying the other.  This mechanism tends to keep them fairly closely aligned.  Same is true of S&amp;P futures or any stock futures really.

Probably 80% of the volume right now is day traders.

Anyone check out that website?  Looks real legit.. you should definitely give them your $2 mil.

So you would rather have loans denominated in a deflationary currency?   If you took out a home loan 5 years ago denominated in bitcoin, you would be deeply underwater right now.

No sign of the hash rate dropping yet.  Presumably there will be a price point where miners start dropping out of the pools?
