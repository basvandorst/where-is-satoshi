So let me get this straight. You're not 16, developed an app (which is 99 cents on the store), and didn't write a medium article, and don't even have a website to present this on? No press kit either? No interviews? GO TO HELL SIR.

"VPN", which vpn? If its a VPN service such as ip vanish then there you go, would be my bet.

Many factors, it could for instance provide you a different DNS depending on how its setup, it can open up lots of MITM possibilities depending on the service and how its set up. ELI5 is youre shifting trust from your ISP to the VPN provider. Have to say its farfetched to assume this is the culprit, but it simply opens up ALOT of possibilities to get 'hacked', i think someone with deep knowledge on the subject can write a book about whats possible.
However, i find it more farfetched to think someone hacked into your computer which had the pdf stored on an encrypted drive. This would mean you had to be personally targetted by someone very proficient, highly unlikely unless you were open about investing in bitcoin before starting with the wallet if you'd ask me. 
There is a good reason that website hints at running the website offline on a ubuntu live cd, he shouldnt provide the service to generate a paper wallet online really, it's a bit irresponsible..

Same thing happened with my wife once she became pregnant, it still worked out, but when she gave birth never again hot sex. Same thing happened with Bitcoin, it gave birth to BCH

PSA: The amount of times the word gambling is used is staggering, please go visit your local casino instead if you think bitcoin equals a gamble.

So its my bad, that i dont know what the hell hes talking about, i SHOULD. But, for now, since it seems im out of time to grow on the subject regarding august 1st, please ELI5, someone..
All my coins are now at kraken.com, but following the link the guy talks about in the video ( it doesnt seem safe at all.
So okay, i send everything to my wallet(exodus), does this mean im safe for whatever decision thats going to be made? I have the keys then, and the wallet has nothing to do with BIP 148, right? 
He also talks about doing the validation yourself, but there nothing more to it than holding your coins in exodus, does this mean im also at risk since its up to the decision of Exodus' developers whatever they are going to decide on? If so, is there any safe wallet to recommend?

Tools such as these built that are built on javascript using npm are notorious for their dependencies that can go up in the thousands. You are hereby warned. [
Even if you go offline, forget it once and you're potentially effed.
