Commonly used money in USA, yes.

Around 125$?
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:46:20
This is hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:18:58
It's a valid concern, just deposit to a trusted gambling site and withdraw. Easy as fuck.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:46:40
This is bad.

This works from my experience. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:58:39
well, they want a bank transfer, fuck it ill just go to the bitcoin atm tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:26:48
ok, your choice. i enjoy using it as a upvote alternative that actually means something.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:07:53
wait, i was able to deposit to virwox(8.4% fee from my master card) so what should i do now?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:22:56
that's be assuming i live in the us and have a paypal card, sadly i don't have access to the debit card feature since i live in Israel but I would still like to buy some coin (about 50$ worth just to get started with it since I'm completely new to this).       
worst case scenario i can go to the bitcoin atm but it's pretty far           
edit: wow, downvotes for living in Israel.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:28:41
well I've checked it out and I'm impressed but why is the price so steep, its like 400$ per coin on some. why is the price for coin on paypal so high? and can i use this to my advantage to get cheap money on paypal? like buy with other ways and resell for 350+?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:57:40
i dont mind losing 10%
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:51:24
Oh right, I always forget about chargebacks, basically it reverses the trust situation since if I pay him in a non reversible way he can just say no coin for you too.
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:12:35
well, after a lot of fees (north of 20%) i got 0.0305 btc for 10$
@_date: 2015-03-26 22:17:23
yup, as i said if it were a actual amount i'd put in more tome and effort to not have so many fees but seeing as i just wanna try this and tip some redditors this isnt so bad 100 bits
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:55:32
i saw this before and thought it was a bit shady, guess ill try it anyways.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:32:12
but they are us only.
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:51:04
and they don't accept Israeli paypal accounts. I'm really lost with buying bitcoins safely
