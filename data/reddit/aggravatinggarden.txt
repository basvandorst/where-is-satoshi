 Localbitcoin service is very convenient service and safe, but in order to buy Bitcoin instantly and with minimal commissions via credit card, I usually use [Indacoin.com](

 Today there are so many exchangers that are able to get you bitcoin and another cryptocurrency without any special problems. But if we are talking about buying through a credit card without additional identification, then I know only one resource where you can do it, this is Indacoin.com

Prompt a service for cryptocurrency exchange) do not offer localbitcoins, these people are sell outs. They're selling our information to the government and we use crypto for privacy and freedom to choose whether to report or not. Wouldn't recommend them to anyone anymore, I've done tons of business on LBC but now I've shut down everything and am ending my account with them. Looking for alternatives and found a few, has anyone tried [MoonTrade.org]( they seem to have no KYC and also support BTC and ETH and XRP trading ��
