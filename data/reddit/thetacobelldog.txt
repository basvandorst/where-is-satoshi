Ah. So you're saying it could be intentional sabotage because they are responsible for a large part of the slowdown with BTC, which in turn helps sell BCH which they have a bigger interest / profit margin with?

You like, like like?

Sorry to hear that. Kraken took $50 from me. I can't even fathom your amount being lost.

Can someone take 30 seconds to explain to me why Coinbase doesn't want to use Segregated Witness?

Coinbase is by far the easiest option. My mom could figure out how to use Coinable. It's no less safe / more safe than most other options, so either you want in or you don't.

While interesting, I feel like on this entire map there are no real surprises.

If it's impossible to loose it must be impossible to tight too.

I know for a fact I used my GPU, because I remember getting a new computer and thinking "Oh hey I can try that mining thing again because my graphics card is compatible".
I have no idea what a mining pool is? I could research that and get back to you. Perhaps it was different back then?

I should specify the hard drive is thousands of miles away from me, so I'm trying to get a little information before I make the trip to go see. The whole process just didn't seem like an important thing to remember at the time, likely because I didn't do much of it, but now with the price so high I just wonder if I did enough of it.

I agree with that. As long as Bitcoin tech keeps up with the up and coming competitors, it will lead the pack for a long time.
