"I’m still trying to understand how the hell a journalist can (1) just show up unexpectedly a person’s home demanding an interview, (2) remain there defiantly after being told to fuck off, and (3) write an article about it remarking how ‘annoyed’ the person looked."
yeahhhhh how could a journalist ever do this its so unheard of
