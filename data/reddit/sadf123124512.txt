maybe they're planning to switch to some other company.. this isn't the first one they've used..

try a credit union - they operate under different legislation than banks.

It's shady, but I don't think the UK LLP is particularly important.. it's just a name they use at the moment.. if it gets seized or shut down I expect it will turn out that all the assets were moved to some other entity the day before or were never there or whatever is most convenient.

Probably not the non-banking option many would like to hear, but open an EUR bank account, then use kraken or bitstamp.

not really. there are a few like maybe coincorner.com, but there aren't any that aren't so overpriced you'd be better off spending the giftcard and buying BTC with other money.

Here's a working example - the bitcoin otc irc bot;  
In order to be useful you need the user to prove they own the ID (since otherwise someone could self assign one that belongs to someone else) - and that means some kind of challenge response system like the IRC bot uses.. unfortunately that's pretty inconvenient and probably most people won't use it. 
This kind of thing works much better in ethereum since your browser (ie, alethzero/mist? or whatever) has the ability to manage keys and also do the webpage javascript stuff so there isn't any annoying copy/past'ing between apps. 
It would also be possible using a normal browser using a client certificate if the browser's PKI could do secp256k1 - unfortunately it can't and there are currently no plans to implement it.. of course you can achieve much the same thing using some other (normal) client side ssl certificate.
