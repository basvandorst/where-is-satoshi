Utter bollocks. The past is not the future.
Comparing previous January's is beyond stupid.

Took my profits at 11k gbp and now I'm gambling for free.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:23:38
Seems odd to me to be celebrating losing bitcoin folk, but whatever. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:37:58
And that's what makes me feel the OP is the unintelligent one... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:24:48
Top tip : make sure something is ironic before using the word.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:09:19
It was designed as a currency.
Now it's not practical to use as currency. That isn't something to be positive about.... 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:08:23
Yeah I agree. I'm thinking of taking my profits and running with all the crap going on lately.
The HODL obsession is out of control. "HODL because it will rise again, like it always does". That sounds like blind faith rather than logic to me... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:46:57
You're incorrect. Sir Lame is bang on the money on this one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:16:48
Yes and I'm sure you're there, buying several bitcoins in the dip! Because no-one is full of shit in reddit! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:09:06
I did sell. I took some profits and left some in. This is real life.
And real life is NOT listening to randoms on a subreddit. It's making your own decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:59:07
I think there's a good chance it will be... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:14:02
I am indeed British :) 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:46:38
Well, you've totally convinced me with that logic... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:37:21
I don't like your tone. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:29:43
Nope. Had my phone on "do not disturb" and missed all my price alarms.
Lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:29:28
Tell me about it. Such a pathetic generalisation that really doesn't sway in the real world. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:54:49
You seem like a right knob. You could have e just answered his question... 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:34:26
You can give yourself a mathematical edge in poker, so a good player will always profit eventually. I wouldn't say poker is true gambling. 
Roulette wheels, slots, blackjack etc etc is true gambling as you can't create an edge for yourself... 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:00:10
I'm thinking it might not be that kind of deal...
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:56:06
Can you take a profit and still leave coin in there?
I did that and it makes life a whole less stressful. I went from checking the price every half hour to every few days. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:48:16
Yeah that was genius. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:17:02
He said he'd buy at 8k, then at 6k, then at 4k.
I'm no mathematician but that sounds like a stupid plan to me. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:17:48
I panic sold most of my coin and made a profit at £11k.
It's looking like a good spot. I'm nearing the amount I bought in a now.
Already having a profit makes this situation a bit calmer for me. Though it is still pissing me off tbh! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:41:02
Yeah this guy seems totally legit. I believe him and have just bought 10 bitcoins on his word. /s
These threads are just hopeful. I still think everyone needs to take any profit they have and leave some in to gamble with. Because we're all just gambling at the end of the day.
Not happy with people advising everyone to HODL. It's irresponsible and playing with other folks money. Because there are a lot of gullible people out there... 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:03:17
Not bad, just odd!
I wish I was as odd as you. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:03:51
As a failed poker professional, I can't control my emotions. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:12:04
Unmmm, blockchain is not a bubble. It's an incredible concept which is unlikely to die. 
Bitcoin, however, could still go either way. It may or not be bubble. It certainly behaves like a bubble that pops quite often, then reinflates. More a balloon then! But one day, it might not reinflate. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:29:56
The logic is strong in this place actually...
Always AFTER the event though.
Loads of people predicted the Jan crash after it happened with graphs. Such clever people. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:13:24
I'm aware of DCA.
I don't believe it's a good idea to use it with crypto's though. No other market is as volatile. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:20:05
O absolutely.
In all honesty I did invest too much. Hence I panic sold at 11k gbp and made a profit, but left some in. To free my mind of worry really.
I do think that's what people should do on the whole. Some are fine with losing a few grand on the chance it may fly back up. And it may do. Either way, I can't regret my decision as I'm not constantly checking the price anymore. Peace of mind is good for me. I hate losing money! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:51:12
Sorry bro, it does. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:32:58
I can afford to lose the bit I have left in.
But I'd prefer not to. I'd prefer to make 1 gazillion dollars from it instead. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:48:53
Aww shit.
Maybe never tell your friends anything like this again lol. My friends would rip the piss out of me now with what is happening at the moment. So i feel your pain!! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:06:02
I like that analogy. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:56:22
I just don't think buying while it goes down and down is sensible with something like Bitcoin, when Bitcoin could potentially die with too much government regulation. Assuming it will always end up climbing again is not based in logic. 
And that's my point. Crypto is still a new deal that we've got nothing to compare to.
