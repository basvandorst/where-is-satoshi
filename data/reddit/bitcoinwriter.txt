Bernanke is opening his letter by saying that already way back in 1995, a senator thought that innovations in the world of money could have some promise. He is NOT saying that Bitcoin holds promise.
Just today, I came accross an article with the following quote:
"Meanwhile, some U.S. officials appear to have warmed to bitcoin. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure, and more efficient payment system,”

Trezor + Ledger multisignature scheme using Electrum or Copay
E.g. you set up a 2-of-3 multisignature wallet where one of the keys is an app on your phone or browser, one of the keys is a hardware wallet and the third is a spare, encrypted private paper wallet.
For something more simple, a simple BIP38 encrypted paper wallet.
