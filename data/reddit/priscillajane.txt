I'd mastered the vocative comma by the time I was 10.  We're out there.
To be fair, though, it's missing a comma after "says."  Since adults have problems with commas, too, I'm inclined to chalk the successes and failures here up to ignorance, rather than assuming the writer knew to do it right when he/she did it right.

The purpose of juries in the balance of powers was to allow citizens to "veto" laws they don't support by finding defendants "not guilty," irrespective of the facts.
Unfortunately, the courts don't instruct juries that they have this right.

The US gov doesn't consider anything as money except fiat USD.
The IRS is currently classifying Bitcoin as a commodity.  That means if you sell it in the same tax year as buying it, you pay income tax on the profit.  If you sell it in a different tax year as buying it, you pay capital gains tax instead.  (disclaimer: not a tax lawyer)

The defendant's description of events doesn't imply that he engaged in, or attempted to engage in, any illegal activity.  The sale of Bitcoin is legal, unless he needed a licence of some kind, and we don't know that he didn't have one.  (Due to his multiple Nevada corporations that were Bitcoin-related, he may have had all the licenses he needed.)  None of that involves entrapment because they hadn't asked him to do anything illegal.
I think the entrapment comes in when law enforcement mails him $14,500 in cash (allegedly breaking some law) when their agreed-upon price was only $9k and change.  That puts him on the spot and forces him to make a snap decision about something he had never thought about before.  Law enforcement is only supposed to give you opportunities to commit a crime you were already disposed to commit, not push you into a crime you weren't already ready to do.  So what was an innocent-minded, law-abiding citizen supposed to do in this defendant's shoes?  The box of cash is sitting on your kitchen table (or wherever).  Do you call a lawyer?  How long is law enforcement going to wait before swooping in to arrest you--do you have time to call a lawyer?  Are you screwed if you don't call the police immediately?  If you've truly never considered this situation (as a person without mens rea wouldn't have), law enforcement's actions certainly are pushing you toward actions you don't understand the full consequences of in a context where you may very well have never intended to commit a crime.  I would consider that "trickery" of the officer and possibly even fraud.  And that would be entrapment.
I'm not arguing, of course, that these feds broke the law.  We pretty much all know that federal law enforcement is allowed to entrap.  I don't think it's right, of course, but it's legal.

It's definitely entrapment.
Marijuana is legal in California, but it's still illegal under federal law, so you can get charged with a federal crime for using marijuana even in a state where it's legal.  (This is why we have the Tenth Amendment, too bad nobody takes it seriously anymore.)

You asked for a citation on the British homicide rate before and after their gun ban.  This conversation is about Europe.  I've never researched Australia.

You seem to be implying that this guy deserves jail time, whether or not he did something wrong in this specific situation.
I think that communities are less likely to rally around a drug/gun/darknet user, and that's why the government goes after those people when they want to set a precedent using the courts that is designed to take away everyone's liberty.  Beware of your tendency to take some people's rights less seriously than others', because the precedents set by those cases apply to all of us.

The guy says in his video that Bitcoin is legal tender in California under state law, and he gives the statute number in the interview.

Mens rea is a throwback to the days when crimes had to have victims.  If you didn't have a guilty mind when you killed someone, it wasn't murder, it was something lesser.  An accidental homicide, perhaps.  Today, most of our crimes don't actually hurt anyone, and the requirement of mens rea has been eroded substantially.  In most cases you can violate a statute without mens rea and still face the penalty.

"Governments don't work without taxes. And you can't have those without the implied threat of violence."
You're right.  I'm not advocating that the government should never be able to use force or the threat of force.  I'm saying that when the government has a monopoly on the use of force, that's extremely unhealthy for the society as a whole, and it leads to a deteriorating relationship between the government and the People.

Thanks OP.  I saw this vid yesterday and was disappointed--but not surprised--at the corrupt way our federal agencies try to entrap those who threaten the mainstream financial system.

It works when the government and the citizens are actually working toward the same thing (e.g., a stable society, economic prosperity, justice for all, etc.)  In that case, the People themselves ARE the government's monopoly on force.  And the government truly acts in the interests of the People.
It's only when the government and the People are working at cross-purposes that one or the other wants a monopoly on violence.  You don't need violence unless you're trying to strip somebody of their rights.  And you don't need a monopoly on violence unless you don't want the other party to be able to defend themselves.

Entrapment is when law enforcement contacts you, "seduces" you into doing illegal activity with them, then they arrest you for your part in the activity but they're never charged for their part because it's "law enforcement."
In this case, they contacted the defendant, asked him to sell them Bitcoin, negotiated a price, mailed him a box of cash containing the agreed-upon price plus an extra $5,000 or so (putting it over the legal limit for interstate commerce, or something), and when the defendant called them on it, they lied in court claiming they told him the money they sent him was drug money, when in fact they never told him that.  (All this is according to the defendant's version of events from the video.)  So, they tried to entrap him and failed.  Since they couldn't get him on the over-$10k thing, they just lied so they could get him anyway.
So the entrapment probably won't be an issue in the case since he was smart and it didn't work.  But there were definitely entrapment attempts by law enforcement.
Edit: Entrapment is generally illegal in the US, but an exception is made for FEDERAL law enforcement.

They definitely have better stuff to be doing.  It seems to me that they aren't trying to crack down on marijuana use so much as to target and harass this particular defendant for political reasons (they are afraid of Bitcoin).

My understanding is that the feds claimed they made this comment, but they did not.  At least, the video discusses how the defendant has the text records of their entire conversation(s) and they never made this alleged comment.  They just made it up trying to get a warrant.

I think his point is that money laundering shouldn't be a crime because the criminal activities that make money "dirty" shouldn't be crimes.  Am I right, b734e85...etc.?

I misspoke, though.  It was the homicide rate that skyrocketed, not the gun homicide rate.  Personally, it doesn't matter much to me whether you kill someone with a gun or a knife....

The accusation "exchanging $14,500 in US currency represented to be proceeds of manufacturing and distributing "hash oil"" means they are accusing him of accepting drug money, not providing it.  He was the one with the Bitcoin.  The fed was the one with the cash.  The fed gave him $14,500 in cash in exchange for some Bitcoin.  What the allegation means is that the fed told him that the cash came from selling hash oil, that is, that the guy knowingly accepted money that was earned from drug sales in exchange for Bitcoin.  That is, indeed, illegal.
But, if you watch the video, the defendant denies that the fed ever told him that.  He claims that this was a 100% online deal and that he has records of every conversation he had with the fed, and they never claimed it was money from selling hash oil or anything else.  In other words, the feds completely made that up in order to turn a perfectly legal sale of Bitcoin into an illegal sale.
Who knows who is telling the truth.  But the defendant seems to have the records to prove his story, and we will see if the feds are able to prove theirs.  I am accustomed to seeing the federal government try to entrap people like this for political reasons.  It happens all the time.  This particular defendant was smart and so the entrapment didn't work, and the feds had to lie in order to get him.  At least, that appears to be the case from this video.

His company is called Bitcoin Inc.  He could call himself the CEO of Bitcoin because of the convention of dropping the "Inc." when referring to a company by name.  (Nobody says "McDonalds Inc.")  But I don't think he's trying to imply that he runs the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:31:22
In the video, he said he ran several Bitcoin-related businesses in Nevada, including Bitcoin Inc.  It's quite possible he DOES have a registration or license to run an MSB.

"if you check history, you can see there was a time with real money (gold and silver coins) and look at how those societies were structured. people built fortresses and the times were much more violent."
I'm no economic historian, but I'm pretty sure that was before modern economic theories like lasseiz-faire (not sure I spelled that right!).  Back then people thought they had to hoard money or they would lose their wealth. I think we place more value on trade today because economics is also about the value of goods received, not just money spent.  We understand that a transaction can be win-win (that is, you can let go of money and still "win").

I think it doesn't even matter whether the money came from drugs or not.  If the officer tells a guy his money came from drugs, and the guy accepts it, he has committed a crime.  I'm pretty sure.

I imagine they went after him because of his involvement with Bitcoin.
He discusses in the video why this is a precedent-setting case.  They're probably trying to come after all of us, and they think this case will give them the extra powers they need.

I question the claim that people are free in Europe.  Sure, compared to people in North Korea.  But compared to Americans?  No way.  And Americans have lost many of their traditional liberties.
It's also wrong that people don't kill each other in Europe.  Every time some new European country confiscates firearms, the incidence of violent crime skyrockets.  Anyone remember when Britain banned guns, and the gun homicide rate went up 300%?
@_date: 2018-02-23 15:15:17
It might not be.  The government always seems to face a lower burden of proof than their defendants.
It seems sensible to me to consider the $9k a payment and the extra $5k a gift.  After all, when someone sends you unasked-for money in the mail, usually it's a gift.  But that may not be a smart thing to say in court.
