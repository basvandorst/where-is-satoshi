Never going to invest in an impractical joke. Currency should be simple: you trade with it. If you cannot trade with it, then it is useless.
If I happen to privately issue a new currency, just 1 piece of Garbage World Wide money, and say I am not going to print anymore- the theoretical GWW value (just as BTC) will rise and theoretically be infinite.
My theory: the value rises because people gobble BTC, it will crash as soon as (if) there is an option to actually spend the cash.
You're trying to explain Bitcoin on the technological level and I dismiss it on the absurdity level.

Bought on a 3rd party trading platform.
Doesn't matter, though, can't glue a value ticket on an immovable object (or a virtual one)

Some guys claimed that Bitcoin's value will grow towards ~100K, what kind of fee will be charged then? how can people rationalize getting rid of the current monetary system for this illogical one?

Don't get cocky, I know Fiat currency is valued around trust.
My point is that I can buy multiple things with 36$, while the equivalent value BTC is immovable by the system.

How do you suggest migrating the whole world's population to use BTC?
I can buy enough BTC to send and receive it, now what happens to people who regularly use Zimbabwe Dollars? 
The whole idea of BTC is moot.

No thank you. Wanted to experience the revolution, turns out it's just a flop with zero potential. Unless a government gets hold of the tech and starts regulating it.
