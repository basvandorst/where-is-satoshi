Or 3, quote everything in USD. That's basically what I'm suggesting, tie everything to the USD (for now). The exchange sells enough BTC to get the price in USD, close enough as defined by the TOS.


Yeah, I think the existing exchanges are in the best position to do it. Best liquidity, already have fiat accounts, etc.






Spread doesn't matter if it's all tied to USD, you just sell as many BTC as needed to get to the price in USD. Yeah, the customer isn't getting the best possible values out of their USD at that particular instance, but that's **SO** not the problem BTC is facing right now.

I don't think this is the same thing. I'm talking about eliminating bitcoins from the merchant side completely. The sites above seem to be another *BTC* processor.

This doesn't really answer why would the merchant want to do it in the first place. We need new merchants accepting BTC, catering to existing merchants is preaching to the converted.

Volatility is the only risk here, and it's practically eliminated if an exchange implements it. Customer pays BTC, they're immediately sold, and in the merchant's USD account.
All other fees are per withdrawal, instead of per transaction, like with a credit card. You can make this under 1 percent easily.

Care to point me to it?

Why would a merchant be interested in this? Why would they offer a discount? There's nothing in it for them.

The point it to tie BTC to USD, for the sake of the merchant. Customer is effectively getting an amount in USD and giving it to the merchant, at some inconvenience to them (it must be convenient for the merchant to get any adoption at this stage). Maybe the "quote" is overestimated, and change returned after converting to USD. It's an implementation detail. The important point is that BTC needs to be more useful as a currency, and to do that, merchants need to have an incentive. Lower fees and no chargebacks would be an incentive enough, at some inconvenience / imperfect deals for current early adaptors.

Yeah, exactly. I feel like we're in a chicken-and-egg problem here, BTC by itself is not ready for use as currency today - too much volatility and technical complexity. So, little point for merchants to put in effort to accept it, which essentially leads to a speculation-only market, and we're back to square one. 
I'd love to actually use my BTC as currency, maybe overpaying a bit for the privilege, but knowing that I'm actually trading BTC for goods. Enough users, and the volatility would go down, at which point we can move to using BTC directly.
