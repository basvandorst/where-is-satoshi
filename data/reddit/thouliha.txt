It seems counterintuitive, but overall government run health care systems around the world are usually far more efficient and cheaper than privately run health care. 
For example, medicare only takes 2-3 cents out of every dollar spent, whereas the insurance industry takes 15-30 cents. 
Here's a video of why:

The best bubble indicator is called PE10, or the shiller pe ratio.
It takes the price of the SP500, divided by its earnings over the last 10 years(because a company's earnings can fluctuate wildly from year to year) . 
Historically it averages 15, and if it gets up to around 30 or so, a crash is fairly imminent.

He is absolutely opposed to gay marriage, and has said so on multiple occasions. Same with abortion. Leaving it up to the states is just a way of saying he won't do anything to support these causes, so people in these red-states are fucked. 
His being anti net-neutrality is debate-worthy here, but it should go without saying that he prefers that corporations like comcast and time warner should be allowed to do anything they want and not have their corporate freedoms impinged.
With regard to your stance on health care being a positive right, do you think we should equally do away with the fire department, water, and electricity, and put these services in the hands of private corporations?
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:34:51

Thanks! I've still been working on it, but wanted to add some more security-related features before I did another request for beta-testers. Right now, anyone running the client can join any node, but I wanted to add a feature where you could provide a *whitelist* of IP addresses, and only those nodes could join.
Even though I haven't added that yet, it would still be extremely helpful if you could help me beta test it. Just follow the instructions  there on how to install it, and let me know if you run into any issues. If you do, I'd prefer you open them on github as its more integrated with the code and fixes than this is.
Thanks a bunch.

Finland overall has much better health outcomes and life expectancy than our private system in the US. I have a ton a personal stories of friends and family being fucked over by their insurance companies.

I agree. I see BTC as a universal second language. Or a timezone type thing. 
You don't tell someone in a different country to pay you USD, or tell them to call you at your local time. You translate it to theirs. 
After a while BTC may become so ubiquitous that we don't need to convert to local currencies, but its pretty useful for someone to tell me they sent me $10.

Yes, I explicitly said it's valuable as a payment processing system. But bitcoin isn't some money tree for poor Ugandan farmers. It doesn't help him extract himself from being exploited by the people selling him seeds, or other giant farms that can also use bitcoin to do the exact same thing.

While I agree that regulating currencies is retarded, we shouldn't forgoe all regulation. Sometimes the neanderthals need to be knocked down a few pegs. Monopolies and cartels do develop naturally, and they need to be broken up to allow competition.
Bitcoin is doing just that, breaking the payment processing oligopoly of visa and paypal.

@_date: 2014-03-27 15:57:58
I doubt anything in the structure of bitcoin limits the ability of anyone with a lot of resources to take advantage of it.
For example, if you do want to reap the rewards of mining, rigs now cost at least $5k. That's a barrier to entry that the average person can't cross. 
Bitcoin won't do anything to solve problems of unequal wealth distribution, because its structure rewards those at the top, with the most resources to buy the best hardware.
I still love it though, because of its openness and transparency. But don't think for a second that it somehow doesn't benefit the people at the very top more than the people at the bottom.

Unfortunately there just aren't many other companies competing with them yet. Once they go down, we're fucked. I've heard of only one other company that can do ACH bank transfers. There must be some great regulatory barrier to this or else there would be more companies that could do it.

Totally agreed. If anything, bitcoin is socialist, because its users/miners are in control of the means of production. Its heavily cooperative, which is something libertarianism isn't to keen on.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:43:01
Yes but the money is unusable without the keys, making the mattress analogy work. If your cold-computer dies or gets corrupted, as all hard drives/computers do, that money will be lost forever, just like money stashed in a mattress would if the house burned down.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:00:34
To get to the main argument though, I agree with him. Bitcoin is, above all, a cooperative system. Its more socialist than anything, because its users/miners are in control of the means of production. 
Libertarianism, while being anti-gubment, isn't too keen on social cooperation of any kind, which is what makes bitcoin work.

Cool, just checking. I'm a dev, and while I use coinbase for my site too, I'm exploring the possibility of making a self-hosted bitcoin merchant payment processor. Basically just a local wallet that has an embedded web server that you can do merchant stuff for. 
It means that you would host the merchant server, and the payments would go directly into your own local wallet instead of coinbase.
There's a good one called straight-server, but it lacks a ton of features and would make a poor coinbase replacement.

Have to agree with you here. Currently, there are only a few reputable companies selling mining hardware. Assuming that competition is allowed to flourish(no malicious patenting and hardware monopolization), then more and more companies will pop up and drive the prices down, resulting in the type of devices you're talking about.
BUT, I'd like to mention that currently, there isn't much competition, and mining is currently prohibitively expensive for the average person. When I looked into buying a rig a few months ago, it was going to cost me $10k, and there were only two companies currently competing.

I agree that many merchants will want to comply with their countries kyc, but let's keep in mind that this is an internationally usable solution.

The alternative that merchants are using right now, is centralized services like Coinbase or bit pay. 
How would you have merchants accept payments with no wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:47:50
As merchants properly start using BIP70, you'll start seeing more wallets list transactions with merchant names of items on them. 
I'm the dev for [bitmerchant]( and [here's]( what a proper payment/donation form should look like. If you load that with your wallet, you'll see a vendor and item name, not just an address.
Now we just need wallets to record and show that vendor and item name in place of the addresses.

I don't really know much about how lighthouse would fit in here. This is more of a free merchant platform to fill what coinbase and bitpay are currently doing.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:16:38
Bitcoinj(which this service is based on) **does** create unique addresses each time. You don't need to generate an entire new wallet for each new address. One wallet can generate as many new addresses as necessary.
One wallet can scale large, because the bitcoin network only knows about addresses.
To give an example, you could have a POS system(IE, a ton of registers at walmart) each being given an address for receiving money, from a central wallet. That being said, BIP32 wallets are a better way to go for this scenario.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:17:44

Maybe some of the remittance services? Obviously coinbase and bitpay can do this, but they generally require KYC and a 3rd party wallet.

@_date: 2015-01-26 01:30:07
I forgot to add, that coinbase tried to do the same to me, or at least kept requesting that I validate.
They have a great API that I basically reverse-engineered for this project, but their KYC stuff was pretty frustrating. So I'm in the same boat.
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:41:56
Converting from BTC to USD is just one piece of what coinbase does. Another big piece is their merchant services, which provides an API and popup payment buttons for people to accept payments for things on their own websites. Unfortunately though, the BTC gets sent to **their** wallet.
This app does the merchant services part, but to a wallet that you host and control.
@_date: 2015-01-26 12:37:30

Yes, the BIP70 implementation can support multiple payments, since it uses the BIP70 Payment requests. 
With refunding though, I currently have it set to refund only to the first refund addess given to BIP70, but if requested later on, I could change it to spread out the refunds equally to any number of addresses given.

@_date: 2015-01-26 12:48:59
Its better than blockchain because its really them hosting a wallet for you, and just giving you a key to access it. Ultimately, they have control over your money.
Bitcoind has no inherent merchant services API. It doesn't create payment buttons that you can use on your website, or provide merchant services of any kind. This app actually uses bitcoinj(which the android wallet uses) instead of bitcoind, and provides functions that merchants need to do, like create items for sale, create orders for those items, refund them when necessary, and have payment buttons and popups that you can use anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:21:19

If you've ever used Coinbase as a merchant like I have, you'd find their kyc habits extremely annoying.
They require you to verify your identify pretty much every week, to give them merchant tax codes, and are pretty much a pain to deal with.
It doesn't ever feel like risk mitigation, just more like over compliance..  To an annoying point.

Is there anything I can do to make it easier for a merchant to use?

I'm the dev, but I'll ELI5 it for you :) . 
You're selling kitten mittens online, and want to accept both us dollars, but also bitcoin.
For the US dollars, you use a credit card machine like stripe.
But for bitcoin you want to be able to have the money go straight into your wallet. Your current option is to use a service like coinbase or bitpay, who helps you out by giving you a way to take money(payment buttons that popup), but the money goes to **their** wallet **first**.
This gives you a way to accept the money directly into **your own wallet**, and create those neat payment button popups yourself.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:15:29
A VPS, or at least a terminal running java, is the price you gotta pay to be completely in control of your payments. 
BUT, VPS's are pretty cheap. The instance I'm running now costs $5/month through digital ocean. 
The SSL cert was like 6$/year, and the domain name was a .tk so it was free.
All in all this was extremely cheap to set up to start accepting payments. 
Since the main point of the service is to generate payment buttons/iframes, you could still use these on your wordpress site... you just can't run the wallet from there. 
I do understand the desire to have it run in wordpressy environments though. I agree with the sentiment too, we need more open source decentralization and less of these big, closed-source solutions like coinbase or bitpay.
Thanks for your support.
@_date: 2015-01-26 00:39:44
This could be a feature added down the road. I don't know of any service yet that does this without them hosting a wallet for you... something akin to requesting their receive address, sending them coins, and them cashing out to USD for you. 
The other complexity of this would be that any potential service would likely not work for many fiat currencies. As a merchant myself, I would leave each user to let them decide the best way to convert from BTC to their native currency. 
Someone mentioned that bitstamp might be able to do this. 
That being said, does the android wallet you run on your computer or phone give you the ability to hedge against bitcoin volatility? No.

Yes, a single miner *could* represent the interests of a community, but with that much power, I doubt they would. I'm not sure all the manipulations that can take place when you control more than 50% of the network, but there are probably a lot.
Would you say that proof-of-work will tend towards centralization in the end?
I've always thought something like proof-by-use would be better. IE, find a way that the users of bitcoin(IE the community who actively sends bitcoin), reap the transaction fees themselves randomly, instead of rewarding computing power.

The wallet it uses is my other project, called [bitmerchant]( which uses BIP70, which is what gavin and folk recommend for merchants. It ensures that you can do refunds and such. Amazingly, most wallets don't even have this feature, even though its ~ 2 years old(I'm looking at you electrum and mycelium).
As far as 2 of 3 multisig, I think the library I'm using, [bitcoinj]( does support these, though I haven't thought about adding a UI for it.

Here's a question I asked on stackoverflow about this problem:
Any distributed system is going to have this problem, but the main point of the above article, is to verify the behavior and data that each client provides. This could include things like making sure that clients can't remove data, that they can't insert too much too quickly, etc.
As of yet, I haven't implemented this type of security, but I'm in a beta stage. So far I've only gotten 2 beta testers from this post :( .

Not sure what you're referring to. OpenBazaar requires buyers and sellers to install the software. 
Sellers have to install something, or else how are they going to have a bitcoin wallet so they can accept payment?

This is a design philosophy difference I think.
OpenMarket uses a system of seller feedback, product reviews, and commenting to achieve the same thing.. kind of like orders placed on etsy.
How do you choose an agent?
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:21:20
Haha thanks a ton. There's still plenty of things to be worked out, definitely still very much in a beta stage, but I'm glad you like it.
There are a ton of ways to do distributed data storage; raft and replicated sqlite are my preference, and they're simple, easy, and reliable.
So I have it set up now, where in order to leave seller feedback, you have to have bought the item, and you leave feedback on individual items. That's what made sense to me, putting your money where your mouth is, as you said.
As far as reviews though, I made it like amazon; anyone can leave reviews, and vote on how helpful they are.

@_date: 2015-03-02 13:30:38
I'm going to include seller and product reviews and questions with votes, just like amazon. But I do need some help thinking about the dispute resolution process. 
I guess it should have an internal dispute messaging service like amazon's, where you respond directly to disputes and those can get forwarded to email if you want.
The priority is buyer safety obviously, because its easy to verify that someone has paid for something but hard to know about the sellers actions. Maybe a page that displays the sellers disputes openly? Maybe simply the seller feedback page and votes would be enough.

I totally agree. Right now I'm trying to start out with a best foot forward, something to give me some direction as to what those core features might be.

@_date: 2015-03-01 22:04:44
I've been weighing the pros and cons of this. Basically, the question, who stores what data? 
It could be fully horizontally replicated, so that every node stores everything. This has a bunch of benefits, being fault tolerant, and be instantly available.
The other option is for sellers to only store their own stores and transactions. This has some security positives, but a lot of negatives and complications. For example, lets say we want to make a search bar that searches for all the products. If sellers are only hosting their own data, then we'd have to query a lot of network locations for just one search query. 
For simplicity and other reasons, I'm leaning towards only sellers having to host the data store, and having it be horizontally replicated, but I'm open to either way. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:34:49
Main reason is platform. 
I'm a big [bitcoinj]( fan, and I believe it to be the most mature framework for integrating directly with the bitcoin network, outside of the C++ core. 
Using this framework, I'd be at a much greater advantage of solving problems having to do with monitoring transactions states, creating dynamic payment buttons, actually using BIP70 correctly as merchants now should be doing...
Another big thing is that I want to make this thing feel like amazon or etsy, and have the sellers run the network, not the users. I don't want someone wanting to buy something to have to run a python program on their computer. They should just be able to go to a website(or any potential sellers IP that's hosting the data). I don't really expect a marketplace to survive unless its web-accessible. 
Lastly, I could create some front-ends for open-bazaar, but I would probably end frustrated by the backend. It seems their focus is more on ricardian contracts, while my focus is going to be on reverse-engineering amazon/etsy/craigslist.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:19:24

@_date: 2015-03-01 22:07:09
How does this process work? As an example, I've bought tons of stuff off of etsy, with no problems, and I haven't seen order fulfillment being a problem with any small shop. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:20:31
I explicitly say in the post that this should be done with a basket of goods.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:00:45
This is the best answer. Its polite, simple, to the point, and it lets merchants discover it for themselves.
If they answer 'no, what's that?', the best reply would be, 'it's a form of payment where you have no fees, unlike the 3% that credit cards take. I can help you get set up accepting it if you like.'

This is the strongest argument I've seen for why an inflation-resistant currency might not be possible. Once you've created too much, you might not be able to go back. Of course, in this case, if its a digital currency, we could remove bitcoins from the system in various ways, like removing fractions of every bitcoin. IE, every bitcoin is suddenly now equal to .98% of its original value, and 1 mBTC would buy 1 apple again.
While I do agree that tieing a currency to something like gold is pointless and arbitrary, it might be a battle worth fighting if you replace gold with a basket of everyday goods most people have to buy.

The tech would be easy(use tomp2p and an embedded bitcoin wallet), but the part I couldn't get past was that you still need 'the pot', a place to store the bets until the hand is done. And who would own or control the pot? IE, poker by its very nature requires a trusted 3rd party.

@_date: 2015-02-04 19:31:35
Wouldn't it be convienient to know that your BTC would always roughly buy the same amount of goods that you have to buy on a daily/monthly basis?
IE, every month, your rent costs 100 BTC. Your cell phone bill is always 1 BTC... etc. Right now bitcoins value relative to these things flucuates wildly... so much so that it is impossible to know how much BTC your upcoming rent might cost you.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:29:11
Which is why gold would make a horrible currency. It might buy a cow one day, and
I think it would be a good idea to start talking about inflation resistant currencies. Or ones that could watch market baskets of goods, and adjust their supply accordingly.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:21:06
Hrm... I wonder why there hasn't been a consumer basket based currency then yet, that seems to make a lot of sense. You wouldn't have much inflation if you tied 1 dollar to x amount of food/housing.

Great article. The one thing I would disagree with is that high volatility with regards to things you buy every week is a bad thing. 
If a potato costs 1 btc this week, and 2 btcs next week, that doesn't make it useful for me as a consumer.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:15:34
I've been thinking about some of the math that would be behind regulating the supply, but am coming up a little short. 
The first problem that I see is coming up with a good global-price-basket. We could just assume that its a first world country, and use an european or US basket of goods, as something to start with.
Second, it seems that you would need some program that would keep track of the prices of potentially thousands of markets/goods/and services. For example, the average price of apples from a lot of stores increases above 1 mBTC. So this program would have to keep track of that, and restrict the supply so that those prices would go down. 
Then again, it wouldn't be impossible for such a program to be written; to find the average prices of a basket of consumer goods. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:59:24
We could easily calculate the standard deviation of the price of milk in USD, over a 10 year span, and do the same with BTC. It would still probably be lower than the standard deviation of BTC to USD over the span of 30 minutes.
@_date: 2015-02-21 20:46:15
It might be a good idea to let people know you accept it before checkout. Checkout comes after even putting in address information; it's the last step. It might be helpful to put one of those bitcoin accepted here things on your site.
As to the evangelists not paying with bitcoin, how do you know that for a fact they never intend to spend anything? Are you keeping track of their name or address and tracking that down for purchases? And how do you know that they would never potentially buy something in the future? 
I agree there are some crazies out there, but realize that complaining is the only way a lot of things get fixed.

Bitcoin.orgs [security page]( recommends the exact opposite of what you suggest: 


And I agree with their recommendations: wallets should be ran locally, encrypted, and backed up. I don't understand why people still advocate storing and accepting money with bitcoin banks. One of the great things about bitcoin is that we don't have to use centralized services anymore, and I'm doing what I can to push that forward for merchants.
As for the security of Bitmerchant: it uses an embedded jetty server which is considered very secure, and is built with boilerplate bitcoinj, which is the backend for most wallets(including the android wallet) nowadays. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:05:45


What fantasy-land is this? That's a pretty ballsy statement, considering the amount of people that have had their bitcoins stolen. Why do you think there will be no theft in the future?


As another poster pointed out, economic bubbles can still easily form even when the money supply is fixed. There have been economic bubbles throughout all of history, and many of them occurred where money supply was fixed. 


Nope. There have been markets and currencies throughout all of human history, yet we still have financial problems and crises. There is no rule that says people act rationally, or that there is a natural selection for economic behavior. People with low incomes often reproduce **more** than the richers.

Okay, so there are two problems we're trying to solve.
1) A decentralized exchange

LocalBitcoins is a centralized answer to 1. Bitsquare might be a decentralized answer to 1.
LocalBitcoins answer to 2 is [this]( which is a list of services that let you pay people fiat online, which are pretty messy and not fun to use in general.
Better services that answer problem 2, are trucoin, buttercoin, coinbase, etc. They are clean and nice to use, but they are centralized services.
What people are saying, is that it's probably not possible to answer problem 2 in a decentralized way online. 
I've been thinking of ways, like using venmo, or the google wallet API, but they all wouldn't work for various reasons.

Hey bashco, I recently built a merchant payment solution called [Bitmerchant]( that's free and self hostable. Would you take a look and consider adding it to the merchant solutions above? Thanks.

It doesn't matter what currency is used, you will still have speculation, waste, and economic bubbles. It's just human nature.

Why? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:03:39
Is this a criticism of bitcoin, or of the bitpay iphone app? 
If I was using the standard android wallet, or even the coinbase merchant app for that matter, it would've taken me about 5 seconds total to ring up an order.

As far as merchants go, there are decentralized options for accepting bitcoin, like mine, [Bitmerchant]( . 
Its a self-hostable bitcoin wallet with a merchant services API, so you can accept bitcoin into a wallet that you control, without having to pay any fees, and without having to deal with coinbases stupid KYC.

Bitsquare is another with in progress, but I highly doubt both of these will help solve the problem of going back and forth from fiat.
Some sites make it easier than others though, like buttercoin for instance.

Buttercoin, trucoin, circle. ACH bank transfers usually do take a few days, but usually charge either $.50 or nothing.

Nope. It's not private once it's distributed. 
Ignore the tech for a minute. You have a bunch of people sitting around a table, with their bets in the middle. When they place their bets, the money moves out of their control, and into the pot. 
They don't have the power anymore over those funds. And that's the crux of this issue, that the control of these funds has to taken away from the group. 
Generating a fair shuffle isn't hard. I found a good open source poker library to create a shared deck object, that still keeps the other cards hidden.

If one(or any) of the clients is storing the key, then they have access to the pot. 
It's analogous to someone sitting at the table being able to just pick up the pot and leave anytime they want.


This makes no sense, decentralized apps work based on shared distributed information. I can't hide information from all parties unless at least one client holds some specific information. Whoever that client is, would be the trusted third party that controls the pot and holds the funds.
Creating a pot with the program, but not having that be publicly stored and accessible info, isn't possible.

I didn't realize that [this]( means bitcoin evangelizing. How is saying that you accept a form of payment evangelizing it? You're literally just letting people know. 


Of course, the point of the thread is that shit only gets fixed/implemented when someone puts pressure on someone else to do something. IE, The only way shit goes uphill is if you're an asshole and you carry it with you. 
Let me ask you this, if those people wouldn't have bugged you in the first place, would you accept bitcoin? 
You obviously started accepting it for a reason, and it probably wasn't that you were aware of your competitors sales figures and decided that they might be stealing your business. 
It was probably those scary evangelists asking you to accept it, and you caving. These people made it a annoying for you to not accept it, and now you do.

Can't believe buttercoin isn't on there, it schools all of them.

Couldn't I just require a bank account auth in the API? It seems to me that any p2p payment system would potentially have this problem.
Do you know of any that don't?

I always thought that it would be good to tie the supply of bitcoins to something like a consumer price index. This would reduce volatility, and ensure that 1 apple pretty much always costs the same amount of BTC.

Geothermal : Our earth's internal heat, of which geothermal works from, comes from the sun. Asteroids with no proximity to heat sources do not have geothermal.
Tide power generation : Tides are caused by the the gravitational interactions of earth, sun, and moon. Also, the sun keeps our oceanwaters liquid. The sun's affect on our weather systems create bigger or smaller tides.
Nuclear : The sun basically is a giant nuclear furnace which keeps us heated. We are copying the sun's primary process, fission. The sun doesn't need to be there for it, but we would not be debating this if the sun didn't keep us heated through this process.

Actually, the definition of money is pretty simple. Its just tweaky elitist dicks who try to monopolize definitions and create their own terminology, rather than trying to communicate things simply and concisely. Words facilitate communication, creating new terms just adds to confusion.

Is this what I should expect to find on here now? People bragging about speculating in bitcoins instead of using them to buy shit?

Dinkydinkes is pointing out that shuttleworth moved his wealth to a less volatile currency. Bitcoin is pretty damn volatile right now, mainly because of currency speculation.

It can be either, a currency or commodity, depending on what people want to do with it. I'm glad these bubbles are bursting because it will stabilize its value, and more businesses might choose to accept it. Think about it, if you own a business, and you want to sell coffee, how are you going to sell it when the price can change so drastically?
You  are right about its volatility... for now. I doubt it will be so volatile in the future, and I base that on nothing at all.
