You surely know how Bitcoin works and no one can help you. I'm sorry for your loss but come on.

Great community

If i send 1btc to an address X. That's 1 input to X. If I spend 0.5btc to address Your, it takes that 1 input to address X signs it and splits it to destination address Y and change address Z. The whole input is spent at the same time but you receive 0.5 back so you spent 0.5. 
If address X had multiple inputs of different sizes it would choose a combination of those to make up the transfer and any left over would go to change address.

Bitcoin can barely even switch to segwit.

Sorry didn't catch that. Once more. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:29:22
Doesn't work with bitcoin cos fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:59:41
You could print out a private key and post it. Cheapest method haha.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:46:54
Hehe ye happens. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:25:11
But you buy bitcoin with the same money that the people you are talking about have lots of. You're not explaining anything. Cant just throw buzzwords like decentralized and call it a day. Something something blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:03:01
Elaborate how bitcoin solves this issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:52:49
Amazon accepting bitcoin would make it fall over more than it already is. And 100 signatures wouldn't even get noticed by the receptionists maid. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:11:30
Just download coinomi and import the private key to bitcoin gold. You can swap it to bitcoin after. If you want to be safe you can send your bitcoin to a new address first, then import the original private key to coinomi.  Coinomi is available on the play store.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:59:36
Now they can

Maths bro
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:48:02
You can't be mad. If bitcoin fees were acceptable and they switched to another coin then fair play, be slightly annoyed. But the entire success of the project depends on it being used. No one will buy anything from it, if during the payment process they need to pay an extortionate fee. You can't argue that bitcoin is a store of value and not good for purchases right now, as well as be annoyed that a platform with its sole purpose being the purchase of goods decides to leave 'digital gold's for a more transaction friendly crypto. And no I don't hold any bch, before I get raped. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:55:04
But the codes already been implemented. Throwing GUI elements on top of already implemented code that can be used in the terminal is not a big process.

Yes the price of bitcoin is tied to alts. Yes if it crashes it takes the alts prices with it. If you think altcoins will go to 0 you are deluded. Some great projects exist among the shitcoins. If you think an alt coin will NEVER surpass Bitcoin then you are doubly deluded. Forever is a long time, tech moves fast, bitcoin by its nature does not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:34:12

You can't be a very good software engineer if you think you can wake up one day and ask other people to basically hack bitcoin. Do you know how it works?

Probably phishing attempts. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:57:32

Watching bitcoin get cancer is weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:28:20
It's not 4mb it's about 1.8mb. and it's had months and still no adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:23:31
For fuck sake, this sub...
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:20:39
Yup. It's like someone's just done a web dev class and tossed in the picture of payments.

Coinbase and gdax are exchanges you numpty. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:23:55
Coinbase is the user friendly buy sell. Gdax is n exchange which is the same company. Could have transferred to gdax for free. Hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:49:34
Ooh segwit through the terminal. That will get adoption up. If the codes there it's surely a simple update for a GUI interface. I don't understand why it wouldn't be implemented by now. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:41:45
Once you pay a channel opening fee and a closing fee and small fees on lightning then yeah it's basically feeless.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:27:58
Well the fees will be more than 5 dollars right now anyway so what were you trying to achieve?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:31:56

They have a valid arguement of technical debt. Making the code complicated and not cleaning up existing code can lead to issues and difficulty developing later down the line. It's a fair arguement and it's within anyone's rights to disagree with a proposal, which is a key to how bitcoin was always meant to work.

There's statistics somewhere that show the amount of terrorism stopped by methods like that and it's basically nothing at all. Think that speaks for itself. If the numbers don't add up and you still use it as reasoning there's other motives.

You could say that about segwit too.

Cmon now. You're allowed to pitch alternative solutions and the market decides what happens. That was always how it was to work. Just because you don't agree with a solution doesn't mean it's malicious. So tired of this.

A compromise is the best possible solution but from what I've seen core side just regurgitates the "segwit is a block size increase" stuff then packs up.

Yes it had some issues. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 19:34:32
Ah i see. yes that absolutely makes sense. All you need to do is give the public key in the form a QR code. And you could give them mycellium to watch the address which would allow them to verify payments on the go but not spend.

@_date: 2017-01-03 02:21:41
I'm aware thank you. My comment was in regard to a transaction fee. 10 transactions in a whole year would be 6% of their yearly income in fees. That was my only point. If you make 30 dollars a year 20 cents on a fee is a headache.
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:02:58
Potentially segwit? How? Do you know something I don't?
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:14:02
Bitcoin - or what he'll be using ie micro payments - can of course be beneficial to a file storage system. Micro payments open a whole wealth of options and features currently impossible for traditional methods. If having a bit of foresight into what can be possible is what you hate, then cool.

It is the control they can't lose. If they can't manufacture more money then their system doesn't work. And bitcoin obviously doesn't allow this. Exactly why the dollar was taken away from the gold standard, they couldn't print more money if the didn't have the gold to back it. So they just said fuck the people and debased the world. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:39:39

Ok man. 20,000. Sure. I'm sure you have all the math behind that too. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:39:53
Indeed man. Very much looking forward to the evolution of bitcoin though. Adding usability to a scenario like that would do wonders for the people and of course wonders for the price overall. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:38:53
It's great news but it also shows what a shit show the euro is.

Welcome to the debate.

@_date: 2017-01-12 22:58:00
Ah I see. Thanks. I would of though time sync was fairly important in something like this. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:23:11
If you scroll down you'll see I was referring to fees. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:28:51
I can't find anything about an ama today. Where?
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:29:57
I'd say that about the UK too. UK could be worse actually. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:05:47
What's the app?
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:40:31
Shit promotional article. And what a heap of crap is this statement....


@_date: 2017-01-06 17:18:55
It could initially be good for bitcoin. Then it could get the attention of the big boys themselves who might try take action. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:19:40
Download the software of your choosing. Be it Core, Classic, Unlimited. Let it sync the blockchain (will take a fair while). Make sure port 8333 is open for you. Check your node is reachable wit this - 
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:16:23
Pretty sure it's already a thing mate. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:24:17
Wow you're a bit touchy are you not? Didn't say he was a saint did I. I said in my opinion hes been good for the internet. Type more names if it makes you feel better.
@_date: 2017-01-14 12:15:34
Pretty much is true tho.

So you did haha. Thanks. Made me dust off the printer.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:26:36
Why? The guys been great for the internet and will be using bitcoin in his new plans.

Could someone be a hero and explain all the Info being displayed? I obviously get the main graph price. But the bottom red and green lines? Buy vs sell volume? 
@_date: 2017-01-14 15:38:00
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:45:06
that the most logical, simple, solution. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:14:20
Is that a euphemism?
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:06:29
They can high five each other
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:43:20
When that happens the whole world is in trouble. An attacker with a quantum computer likely wouldn't even target bitcoin. And the algorithm can be changed at such a point. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:46:41
Soo... 
with a camera.
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:47:01
What's a Google?
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:58:23
I doubt it. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:14:00
Emphasis on the trading aspect. As in trading trading.

[You tell me...](
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:32:01
If you buy 1 coin at 1000 dollars today then some one selling a PC for 1 bitcoin is asking about 1000 dollars. In 5 years if that same coin is worth 10000 dollars then they will ask 0.1 bitcoin for it. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:11:21
I watched the video and enjoyed it but honestly didn't understand how problems were solved. Plus purely a theory right? Good public speaker though. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:30:11
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:32:00
It's a good intention but if it happened without scaling improvements it would cripple the network and no new comers would enjoy it. So they'd never come back. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:08:35
Fork and be the sole user ;)
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:33:11
How are they off the train? The whole point of bitcoin is that you can put forward changes you think are beneficial. At the current time most people agree with core but do you think that will be the case forever? 
@_date: 2017-01-01 21:16:11
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:59:49
Yeah drew a few rough things up in 3dsmax for measurements and just went for it haha. It honestly wasn't that bad, just had to be sure to keep measurements close enough and quadruple check things were aligned. All the hard work has been done by the developers of the marlin firmware. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:25:06
It's a good there there's satellite access too now. Just need all the equipment... 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:33:23
1.7mb. Incredible capacity. Future proof for decades. /s
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:17:08
Bitsquare.io / localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-01-14 14:29:32
That's probably an accurate figure too. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:04:02
Awesome game tho.
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:53:31
Values sent are not the driving of fees. Size of transaction in bytes is. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:52:18
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:17:53
I'm all for going out there and developing things you think can be done better. But in my opinion something too close already exists from a reputable company. And it's the security industry as well which is no easy feat to gain and maintain trust in customers. Best of luck whatever you get up to tho. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 21:32:19
For a side note. I love this guys YouTube channel. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:34:15
It is the control they can't lose. If they can't manufacture more money then their system doesn't work. And bitcoin obviously doesn't allow this. Exactly why the dollar was taken away from the gold standard, they couldn't print more money if the didn't have the gold to back it. So they just said fuck the people and debased the world. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:45:23
How are you different from local bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:16:30
You're allowed to say bad things about bitcoin too you know. Saying it's perfect and nothing is wrong and nothing can come close is bullshit and you know it. Sure bitcoins great in many ways, but it also sucks in many ways right now too. Circle jerks are just as bad. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:56:57
I disagree. Its just the Copyright/Hollywood industry stretching their legs to make an example of him.
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:40:13
Etoro is just betting whether it will go up or down. Buy is a bet for up, sell is a bet for down. Which is why you can sell even though you currently don't have. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:18:09
[soo....]( 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:05:40
No. Too many transaxtioms, each block is 1mb it can only fit in so many every 10 mins. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:33:25
So 1mb for the world with lightning network. Lightning network which not ever one would use and the lightning network that needs an opening and closing transaction on the main chain. It won't work like that. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:37:27
QR codes can be anything. You probably just have the wrong one. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 12:57:03
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:16:49
Like someone said you need to declare it. If you don't they won't know. If you're looking to avoid the taxes then selling them for cash in hand is the easiest way. As soon as you have money flowing through banks then there's records of your financial activities which can be used against you. I'd just throw those bitcoins in a private hardware wallet for a few years though if you don't need the dosh. And if you do need the dosh just see where you fall in the tax brackets and take it from there. If you're earning so much they are going to rape you then go cash in hand.
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:32:07
You'll of used a specific service and without knowing what that specific service was you wont be able to get them back. Like if I made a MySpace account in 2001, those credentials wouldn't let me Into Facebook years later. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:02:17
I'd backlogs are already forming with high fees, can you imagine the carnage of one block every 2 hours... 
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:34:40
What's the evidence that 2mb won't work?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:10:01
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:29:30
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:39:26
Don't they are scams. They post all the time this shit with different accounts.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:21:24
Creating a wallet and sending it is easy and takes minutes. Converting a "large" amount of money to bitcoin may be your biggest issue. Services like circle allow you to buy and send straight from an app. But there's limits in how much you can buy In a week. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:05:50
Converting back to pounds lands you in the realms of legal taxation. Leaving it in bitcoin leaves you clear. If you convert now you'll probably need to declare it as earnings. If you convert it in 5 years you'll probably need to declare it as taxable gains. (assuming price goes up)
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:59:36

So if it resisted all change till the last coin is mined you'd consider that a success?
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:19:01
It's a good domain. I like the idea of you're crowd sourcing too. I tried to make a crowd sourcing app for parking. My quality control was an issue though. Haha.
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:39:43
Just because I asked doesn't mean I'm pro raising the limit. Of course I'm not. Just wanted to see if anyone was and if they had even a remotely valid reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:42:00
Of both... 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:33:54
It was envisioned for everything as far as I'm concerned but the way development has gone has made it a settlement thing of large transaction only viability. I think that's lame too.

The Cornell link says it's fine.... 
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:42:45
If course I totally agree. Just throwing it out there to see if anyone was. I'm sure there is. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:15:01
I feel even if they did intend on returning them, it'll probably get less and less likely with the price rising.
@_date: 2016-12-15 00:37:48
Nope gone. Sorry for your loss.

Curiosity? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:06:55
But now we have satellites for those poor people. They only need all the recieving equipment, computer, and God knows what else. But at least 1mb is keeping it attainable for everyone.

I'd buy 2 bitcoin for £900

I don't think that's correct. Best to download the page and use it in an offline computer though to avoid snooping.

It's great and all but a giant leap for Mankind would be more acceptance and smoother transactions.

@_date: 2016-12-08 15:25:54
honestly man your best road is LocalBitcoins or Bitsquare. And if you put them on for anywhere near 2/3rds value they will be snapped up in a heartbeat. you should ask for more. Check those sites out anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:33:12
I'll have to disagree. If you say 2mb will work then it's a logical upgrade becuase we are at the cap. If it's said that 128mb won't work the. You don't do it. I don't understand your logic here. There would be overwhelming evidence against 128 mb right now and thats why we won't do it. But 2mb?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:10:06
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:39:39
Yeah man i know, that's to them! haha.
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:41:45
How do you calculate how much to pay each employee? Say worker 1 is due a $500 pay that month, you pay $500 worth of bitcoin in that exact moment at the end of the month?
@_date: 2016-12-23 15:38:48
I totally agree. But at the same time bitcoin was made to serve a purpose of beating the banks at their own game. It's on the way like you said but it's definitely not there yet. Once it is, in aspects of real world use, it can/will dominate.
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:00:36

Is it though? A year is a long time. An especially long time since the network is regularly at its limits now.

Don't want to right now. The father has some too and is wondering about the best/ easiest places to sell if he wants to. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 23:27:10
Could you say why?
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:52:54
I agree it's a deterrent. People gasp when I say one is worth 600/700/800 pounds. Haha
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:46:13
@_date: 2016-11-21 11:20:08
I would of thought literally increasing the block size was another implementation.
@_date: 2016-12-15 12:58:11
Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 18:06:48
But if you were able to buy a coffee with it you'd probably be transferring 80 -100k instead because of the adoption. 
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:54:03
Surely if that fails the next logical vote would be bigger blocks/bigger blocks with segwit too. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:32:49

I'll bet you 0.001 btc it will not. High stakes. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 23:42:57
It's a factual observation? Nothing there is untrue. And bitcoin obviously isn't *currently* scaling. I'm in the middle of the two sides personally, but these posts are lame. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:30:39
It's really shit but I tip my hat to them. It's genius. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:38:27
They are not a bitcoin company though. Twas but a service within.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:45:34
The same way you know what's under the hood of the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:43:46
Do you bulk buy bitcoins to prepare for future payments to make it "potentially" financially easier for yourself?

What work are you paying for in bitcoin? What's your company do?

Use a phone app wallet to sweep the funds and then spend as you want. I use jaxx wallet on android. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:47:04
The fees will definitely become an issue soon enough. Tis also my fear. And don't always assume spam. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:20:27
No I asked why you said trezor and you replied with "its better". So I was like fine ledger it is. Xx
@_date: 2016-12-07 00:30:13
Haha did swim purchase something using circles wallet directly? That would probably be why. Coinbase is easy to buy but don't use the wallet there to make purchases. Transfer all bought bitcoin to jaxx wallet. Easiest way. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:43:27
3D printed a couple of these.
And put a paper wallet with some coin on it inside. Should go down alright in my opinion!
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:23:23
I'm talking about the ledger nano s, which also has a screen.

@_date: 2016-12-09 11:54:59
That's exactly what makes it such a difficult thing to make. It's an underground story where you'd kinda have to make up stuff or make assumptions to tell it. Would definitely be a good watch bit would it be remotely accurate. Probably not. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 11:15:23
Should of thrown in an e-ink display instead.

I use jaxx. Are any of those better than jaxx and if so why?
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:00:45
ignore all that nonsense man. Its a gift for god sake. maybe the people they know are rude and ungrateful. I know for a fact my buddies will think its pretty cool and it can start a conversation about it too. Whether its used straight away on a steam game or stashed away in a drawer for a year (with potentially being worth more...) its a solid little gift in my eyes.
@_date: 2016-12-31 16:59:33
Haha ye. Wasn't too bad an article tho. Some worthwhile people's opinions.
@_date: 2016-12-04 08:04:11
I'm against saying block when it's an open vote. People can say no and disagree that's the whole point.
@_date: 2016-12-11 20:12:43
Wouldn't happen in a million years haha. Good to dream tho. The people's pockets it ends up in would never allow it. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:00:42
It's legit. But nobody can alleviate your concerns of an exchange hack.
@_date: 2016-12-24 20:45:21
But yes these are obviously gifts to give not received. Still thought I'd post haha. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:46:22

it needs to scale to keep fees low and not be reliant on 3rd part centralized systems and companies. Defeats the entire point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:05:36
It's slow, expensive and becoming more and more fragmented. With all that being priced so high is strange. It's not useful anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:51
Then it's not immutable. So no. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:34:48
At the end of the day the bitcoin tech isn't working for the demand right now and this almighty segwit is doing hardly anything to help. Sure maybe it enables this lightning layer but that's not helping right now and it probably won't help for a long time either. Bitcoins the dial up of crypto right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:42:15
Jam packed with scaling solutions?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:48:37
You're approximately 100% wrong. Whether there's 1kilo hashes per second or 90 peta hashes a second it's still a 1mb block every 10 minutes. Mining is for security not scale or speed. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:04:43
own absolutely no BCH. But its not exactly as fast, It's much faster because more transactions per block? I'm no mathematician but it checks out. Segwit hasn't done anything right now, It's not even implemented in the Core wallet yet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:05:22
It's it sanity to just have 100000 transactions waiting to be confirmed and fees getting more than a small transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:09:23
It's been 18 months for a while haha. Just an explanation of the joke not shilling.

Keep justifying it. It's unusable right now and I think that's a shame is all. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:02:45
Did you read it properly? Block with no transactions. Full of transactions it's 1mb every 10 mins. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:14:40
Which is exactly what it needs right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:10:13
Exactly.

In 10 years you'll make enough for a transaction fee, maybe. I'd say don't bother. Mine an alt coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:51:04
Was like an hour and 20 mins between a block so that didn't help. No fees fixing that.

It's an absolute shambles. It wouldn't be so bad if this happened over night but scalings needed to happen for so long now it's painful to see this happen. Segwit is a bandaid that can't even remotely cover the wound.

im an iota shill so theres that

Right now it's about 10-15 dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:59:23
They don't have to buy into it per se . They could just broadcast millions of transactions with "some" fees and destroy the mempool. Not expensive for a government. And no one would use it anymore.

They print it...

You don't think saying the solution to the problem is using another coin is terrifying? I own neither btc or bch just now by the way. I'm not a shill. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:50:40
I don't think that was the question. The question seemed like will bch turn into a hoarders currency like btc and not be spent.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:47:19
Honestly quite like that idea. Never gonna happen though.

Something about Lightning that's perpetually 18 months away. We need smaller blocks. Currently watching the mempools tick over 130,000 unconfirmed transactions.

You serious?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:09:21
Did you use bitcoin years ago? It was so great. Cheap and exciting thinking of all the use cases. It's meant to get better with age not worse you Muppet. This is just a sign that the development is not keeping up and it's going to be a nightmare to scale with these limits. If core have already stated that bigger block will happen at some point anyway why hasn't this been tested and rolled out now? We knew this was coming for years. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:06:05
Of course. They've never been wrong about Bitcoin /s

There was that android wallpaper that mined bitcoin in the background back in the day. Everyone who had it installed was mining without knowing. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:24:52
Ah alright. Just saying giving bitcoin to someone who has no interest or knowd nothing about it can go down like a lead balloon. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:37:07
Just learn the basics of how bitcoin works, how a wallet works, how to be sure you own the private keys (some wallets don't give you access to the private keys and without these you don't own that bitcoin) and learn how to properly back up those private keys (normally done in seed form). Bitcoins gotten a lot more user friendly recently but these are still fundamental to being safe with your money. These basics dont take long to learn and there's a lot of great resources available now. And as far as the other guy mentioning the dip coming this might happen due to China shitting on exchanges at the end of the month which will probably shake the market but who the fuck really knows what the future holds. Long term this won't be an issue and you're buying a small amount each week so I doubt you'll be too upset if it does. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:32:59
Hehe educational though.

a transaction is a transaction whether it be for a drink or a house. You don't get to say what's acceptable. And still unsure of the feasibility of lightning.

Ye fees would rocket and everyone would relate bitcoin to being expensive to use. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:35:17
That's entirely dependent on the exchange you are using. Normally once your btc is on an exchange you'll then decide to sell at a time that suits you for a price that you choose. I use gdax so I set my price to sell, once it sells, transfer the money to my bank. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:27:45
Slow confirmations, high fees. It is kinda shit just now. Price is still speculation. which is fair enough and not a bad thing. I wouldn't say it's a joy to use right now though.

Some wallets allow you to choose between low, average, high fees. They​ determine speed of confirmations. Some wallets allow custom entry of fees too. Coinbase doesn't give you any flexibility.
