Good idea, I'm sure kids will teach themselves if left at home alone all day. And fuck needing a medical license, I declare myself a doctor.

That's what Margaret Thatcher said. People never learn, do they?

So why is Google yet to ever have any simple results for the BTC exchange rate?

So, less than 1% per year? Also, you're aware that most people don't even live 100 years? Also, that people can legally be *paid* in USD? Would you be in favor of a BTC minimum wage?

What do you mean?

Alright, if I say I'm a surgeon, and there is no law stopping me from doing that until I actually fuck somebody up, how can you browse through ads for surgeons and know who is the real deal? 
Other providers of education: What about kids who are born into poor families, who's parents can't afford or would prefer not  to pay anybody to educate them?
Re: Intellectual properly laws. What if I sell your elderly mother pills that I call by the same name as her heart medication, and when you get mad that they were just sugar and she died, I say that I just call my pills by the same name? What case would you have against me?
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:37:39
Can you explain how you would do that?
