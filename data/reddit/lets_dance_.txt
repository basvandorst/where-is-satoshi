Great talk but i think he is wrong about bitcoin displacing national currencies. It may be 2 to 5 years but i can definitely see a small country adopting it at some stage. Especially one with a chaotic currency that is continually losing value and which the citizens have no confidence in

My taxes never seem to improve anything around me..
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:47:43
More likely to hit $1000 before $100 in my opinion
@_date: 2015-03-20 00:53:30
Cheers. I can't help develop it but have helped financially as its all i can do. Hope they get it sorted soon

I must have watched this fucking thing about 10 times now and i'm still cracking up. He's like some sort of seal on drugs
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:18:31
Same here. I'd recommend any bitcoiner give it a read
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:58:03
Nice one :)

Just realized the blockchain is still downloading/syncing. Maybe thats the issue..
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:11:26
I wonder what percentage is due to centralization and what percentage is down to individual wallet hacks..
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:25:59
With a complimentary spliff thrown in?

@_date: 2015-03-19 06:28:22
Its still irrelevant unfortunately because i can't sort this port issue
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:35:13
Yes i think it is inevitable. It's a case of when not if in my opinion
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:08:18
Just from looking at how far things have come in 6 years and the money being pumped into bitcoin infrastructure this year
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:59:02
Great thanks! :)
I was wondering if you could help with another issue. I am struggling to open port 8333 on my router
1. It is asking for external port numbers and has two boxes to fill. Any idea?
2. It is also asking for an 'Internal IP address with a dropdown menu of 4 to choose from. I'm not sure which one is correct?
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:47:06
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:51:22
Ok i've done that. Will it still keep displaying '8 active connections' for a long time? I'm just wondering how long i need to wait in order to find out if its worked or not. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:16:19
I'm buying, don't know about anyone else
@_date: 2015-02-08 12:37:21
Coolio :) 5000 bits @_date: 2015-03-19 01:36:19
Cheers. At the moment it doesn't matter because i can't seem to open port 8333 grrrr!
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:51:01
Buy Buy Buy!
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:46:11
As above 130,000 bitcoins can easily affect the price
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:19:21
Not ready yet

People can't see its utility and often find it difficult to use at first so i guess that's why. It's also a really complicated invention when you are just learning about it
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:48:54
After the Rakuten news we all expected this. I also bought 1 btc when i was drunk which has obviously had a much greater impact. Then there's Evolution thieves dumping 130,000 bitcoins into the ecosystem reducing scarcity temporarily..
