what about the gas use for all of the armored trucks? the energy use of actual printing of fiat?  The millions of KWH usage of the banking systems?

I was using common sense but thank you for answering your own question (salty). It would be naive to think that advancements in energy efficiency for all miners will not happen by the end of the year.  Cash Rules Everything Around Me and especially these miners overheads.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:09
err.  Printing fiat uses at much or more energy than mining BTC

Is it begging if this person is providing a marketing service for a medium of payment we all use?

Well, just know that I will trust you without a source and I won’t consider it meaningless.  Maybe fact-check you, but not meaningless.

Recent TA has filled me in on when Halloween will be.  My speculation is October 31st
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:44:46
If you have free energy, only overhead is the miner.  
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:33:09
please, quit spreading FUD
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:59:18
i wish somebody would calculate the energy use of the federal reserve, all the credit companies, and other fiat production.
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:13:46
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-10-19 02:21:19
“Maybe fact check you” is it hypocritical for you to criticize part of what i wrote but lambaste me for the same?

Wouldn't it work for any place that accepted Visa?  What is the limit you can add before verification?

Coinbase customer service is awful.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:40:02
its awful, I spoke with their CS the other day and they told me " they didn't have an answer to my question, sorry"  
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:59:29
They said they were more boobs people than butt people so I stopped there.

Deadspin shared this article too.  I read one paragraph and for the first time in my life I felt I was better than someone.

Depends on the ATM, some have KYC and require ID, if it just straight cash to your wallet only the transaction can be tracked amount and wallet.  
Alternatives like using Monero or bitcoin mixers that split that the transactions making it hard to impossible to track.

Except for Wirex, Uquid, and some others.  Probably more like 4th or 5th bitcoin debit card.
