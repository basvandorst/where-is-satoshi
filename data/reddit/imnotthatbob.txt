Excellent observation! Here's $2 to add to your spread the word funds @_date: 2014-12-13 09:50:04
kudos for creativity! @_date: 2014-12-13 06:47:01
Newbie here:
If I understand this correctly... in nearly six years since Bitcoin's release, it took needmoney90 taking a Computer Security class for this idea to germinate.
I'm guessing it will take someone about three days to create and introduced such a worm into the wild. 
So that means by Christmas, the Bitcoin Open Source development community will have an update to the Bitcoin Core and this will never be a problem again.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's how it works.

You're welcome! I've been lurking for about 18 months. You all inspired me to actually sign up and jump in with both feet. Just funded my changetip account tonight.

Valid points!
It was my 2 cents. Here, you can have it. @_date: 2014-12-13 07:40:36
Not a problem. Those with thin skin should avoid the internet.
Thanks for not being insulted by a two cent tip. I'm just having fun tipping, learning about Bitcoin, and meeting all the great people here.

Kudos on your paper! @_date: 2017-01-01 20:58:33
Way to kick off the New Year!

Not bad. $1

Noticed that too! The link looks like it takes you to a phishing site.
The actual Spondoolies site has no such product!

They even cloned the CoinReport website and replaced Carlo Thomas' article with their own. 
DEFINITELY A SCAM!!!
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:28:12
They copied the entire website and added their own scam product and payment processing pages.
Even the article on miningreport.net looks fishy. It shows being posted by Carlo Thomas on the home page and Michael Turner in the article itself.

"Check it on the Blockchain..." Way to put it, Nic!
