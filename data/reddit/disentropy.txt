not that he would know this.

Except for the fact that you can withdraw your bitcoin anytime onto a different wallet so it's not something merely on a database.

Let's say 2 slices per person, at 8 slices a pizza is 25 pizzas. at $10 a pizza, $250 seems a lot to you for a start up to pay for food for 100 people?
Good thing you don't run a business.

What? ...I think I just became dumber from your post. That's not how markets work. That's like saying, "Hey the price of AAPL can be $1,000,000 if people just decide to sell it at that."
You still need buyers. You need buyers and sellers, otherwise the price will drop to $0.

Oh really? How do you know this? Just curious since you seem so sure that "Bam, your bitcoin is gone if Circle decided to"

Love the Circle app, made me switch from Blockchain and Coinbase.

I just checked and it's way cheaper. Interesting...

Is that train driving the price to the ground?

Thanks for that insightful comment
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:13:04
This is dumb and should be deleted. 
Also, how does this make WU any more friendly towards Bitcoin when they see trolls like this..(I get it, you don't care what WU thinks). People should spend more time doing constructive things instead of wasting space shitting on other non-Bitcoin institutions.
Bitcoin fans are the worst.

This is the correct graph to look at. Can't believe this isn't the top comment but instead that misleading blockchain.info graph is.

Don't you mean you are the troll that trolls in the night?

cause it's illegal in this country and they could lose their business license? 
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:11:05
Interesting. Do you think that there's no company out there then that can monetize bitcoin into a sustainable business model then?
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:33:47
yeah it should have been $0 by now

That's the beauty of bitcoin. They can get into it and you can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:41:17
You say "I have begged on social media for some smart economist to refute this, but none have so far."
That's because smart economists don't hang out on Twitter. I suggest you take up writing a letter to them or at least an email. That way you can convey an actual idea not a 140 character opinion.
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:35:46
Can you provide some sources?
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:06:15

r/bitcoin has become trash. Even HuffPo wouldn't post about this place.
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:11:41
How does that cause the price to go up? if you watch the screens, you'll see it's Asia pulling up the US exchanges. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:55:15
stop buying with coinbase/circle and selling on localbitcoin...
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:28:28
Thanks for the downvotes guys. A simple google search would have helped but it seems like you all like living in denial. 
Here's a link.

Again, I'm a shorter of this right now. Feel and do what you wish, I'm just trying to help as there is no real tangible news behind this surge, so you got to be skeptical.

This is due to a Ponzi Scheme in China perpetrated by a group/company/whatever you want to call them named MMM. That is why the Chinese exchanges are dwarfing the US and European Exchanges.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:54:59
Huge sellers came into the market in 2014 causing the price drop.. bearwhale etc..
I am failing to see the general trend? This has been explosive growth in two weeks, no trend of anyone getting into bitcoin.

345 now :) mate, it was an unreasonable climb, and now reality will set it and it will crater again. Just because I'm bearish on the price doesn't mean I hate bitcoin. I own coin. I just think you're all being irrational.

Fat angry nerds?

I don't get you people. When a bank Executive says Bitcoin is scam, you write scathing things about the guy. When they endorse Bitcoin, you love him. Pick a side posers.

Right... cause it's easy for a company to set up a bitcoin wallet and integrate buttpay ... Not to mention how this price volatility fucks with their accounting department.
