I think there is a good conjecture as to why the government may rather want bitcoin to stay than to go. It is that despite all the reasons why it is disruptive, there is one that is potentially outweighing that: it is the asset class capable of parking a lot of USD, both over-emitted previously and in the future.

Oh well. We'll have prepare then for some network down time and appearance of BCH ver.2 I guess.

Provided the valuable chain remains intact. If, because of the departure, the legacy chain is believed (feared) by the market to deteriorate significantly, the rational decision for a miner may be to go full tilt to the departing chain. Prisoner's dilemma, really.

Check out Georgia (not US), I recall they implemented blockchain into state register, not sure if land as well. 
BitFury advertises Exonum platform just for this kind of purposes, too. Look them up.
In Ukraine they are saying property register will be blockchain-based by end of the year, not sure if fully operational or pilot, though, and not sure how firm that is.

In a pyramid, there is someone promising return / repayment. With bitcoin no one promises anything. As with gold. It is promise-less.

Great, thanks. No problem with no-support, but any means to increase my btc stash are legit :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:39:52
Anything not backwards compatible with current Bitcoin rules, however much it is supported, by whomever, is not Bitcoin.

No one, however sane or insane, can oppose 2x. No more than he / she can oppose creation of any other altcoin out there. It's just that 2x-ed bitcoin is not Bitcoin.

Sounds like a joking matter, until you think that in a couple of months Bitcoin might be getting on a vacation lasting several months...
(Not that I'll stop be a hodler because of that, though; come to think of it, i might as well have no other option... :D )
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:23:41
The way I see it, Bitcoin is going to get disruption-attacked by majority hashpower. Is there a way to resist disruption without resorting to new hardforks (e.g. difficulty altering ones), be it at cost of temporary network dormancy?
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:52:20
Because people agreed to make it exchangeable for some.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:38:08
Looks like miners got themselves into position where they are likely to get screwed. The exchanges and the related crypto-to-realworld infrastructure will not be able to simply replace bitcoin with seg2x-ed coin, however hashpower-backed that new coin would be at the time. Not unless they will be ready to run into some very big legal trouble, I think. Make a provision for a new (seg2x-ed) chain - yes,  but replace the chain that is legally Bitcoin by that new coin - big no. So I guess miners will have hard time choosing between maintaining reputation (keeping word to support NYA) and keeping their earnings (mining on what, hopefully, will be the most highly rated coin at that time, which is legacy). My guess would be that they will try to sit on both chairs - keep most hashpower on the legacy chain while dedicating some minor hashpower on the seg2x - so to pass the qualification of 'supporting' it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:56:27
As I understand it (pls correct where I'm wrong) each block is considered valid once it is 'sealed' with the mined reward. Once there is no reward to mine or it takes too long, hashpower simply won't be needed, no? What will actually be *proof* of work?
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:35:48
Find a better lawyer then. You could need money exchange license and/or money transmitter license, but you would better have a solid proof answer whether you do or don't in your state.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:24:38
I thought entities representing 90% of power committed to support sw2x, but they have not committed to support it with the actual 90 percent power. Also, they never committed to drop support of the legacy chain... Those are the catches, I think.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:26:45
If we are going to that kind of analogy, then it is rather more like providing material support to both a mother and her daughter. Not dating.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:13:23
No, because they will have to not just do it themselves, but also make the rest of the economically significant world enforce that as well. (Otherwise it would be like patching one hole in a... a thing having many holes.) And that is very expensive in terms of political capital. US is the biggest bully out there, yes, but there is so much even the biggest  bully can do. See how overstretched US is already  with enforcing and making others enforce their aml / fatca initiatives.
Sure, they can demonstratively kill some businesses,  but they aren't stupid to not understand that it will have no lasting effect.

Wow. So it is bitcoin.de now who decides who is offender?

I sort of miss how that's a counter-argument to what I said. (If that's supposed to be, idk).
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:40:05
So you propose that whichever coin, out of Bitcoin family, is the *leader*, that coin should be dubbed Bitcoin? That's just not doable. Which is probably just as well.
AOL maybe not the best social network, but I do not think MySpace ever endeavored to call itself 'AOL' just for the reason it outperformed it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:01:14
Buying all the coins would be the stupidest thing for a govt to do. Even if they manage it, which is doubtful in itself, dozens of new copy-pasted bitcoin networks will pop up just like that. They'll get tired buying.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:44:03
If it is "backed" by govt, or an alliance, more so if anyone has actual control over a coin, that is just another fiat. It is doable, certainly, but it is not cryptocurrency and will still be not in the same league as bitcoin for that matter. So it is unlikely that US will issue its crypto-coin, because they already have one - USD. There is simply no point in making a bitcoin ver. 2(US).
As to spending - I agree, it looks less and less likely that btc will ever be a day-to-day spending means, quite like gold in that respect. That is where altcoins or layer 2 or 3 solutions will have their say. They might be backed by btc similar to how fiat was once backed (ish) by gold, who knows.
And then there will still be fiat, because for some financial solutions you just need centralization (yes, fiat will always have its uses, however mainstream it is to bash fiat in this subreddit).

Deposit (normally) earns interest. That's why the customer has the downside of a risk that the bank goes bad. There are types of accounts that are different than deposit, like current accounts - that's when the customer pays the bank for maintaining it and processing payments. The money on the latter ones are (normally) not the bank's property and the customer's risk is only if the central bank goes bad.

The agreement has nothing to do with BCH, same as it has nothing to do with what JW eats for breakfast. So whatever JW has done in relation to BCH is irrelevant in the context of his performance under NYA.
Having said that, why, promises should be kept. NYA looks more like a declaration of intentions, though, but still, even if it is a 'gentleman's word', it is better be adhered to. Although again, as I said, the chances are that miners will end up supporting it only pro-forma.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:09:59
Yes. Hashpower defines which blocks are the true blocks, when both chains of those blocks are compatible. But if chains themselves are incompatible, then the offspringing chain is the alt, however much hashpower it has.
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:13:18
Does that automatically mean that as of some trigger date legacy chain loses 92% hashpower?
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:51:05
For the one like you there are few other guys / gals that actually decreased their holding when trading. That's the very reason why people hodl, if they aren't as good or as lucky as you in trading, but have views on long term fundamentals of btc.

Thanks. How will the valid blocks be decided on then, given that they will be reward-free (only fee-based)? Would not there be an incentive for the miners to group up till there exists only one pool?

They won't go against it straightforward, but rather in a curved line and more or less gradual. They will: impose mandatory reporting of crypto ownership. Then make reporting requirements obscure and cumbersome, then criminalize failure to report. At some point in time they will also prohibit transacting via unlicensed exchanges in whatever jurisdictions. Licensed exchanges will be obliged to require clients to prove they are not terrorists and that their ancestors didn't get their earnings by piracy. Smth like that I guess.

The "ability to fork to cause market shifts" is the part of the game. I say let anyone seeking individual benefits try, and then see what withstands. *Egoism* tests are good for Bitcoin in the long run, else there is something fundamentally wrong with Bitcoin in the first place.
