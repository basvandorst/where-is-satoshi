*Buys some fries, waits 1 hour to confirm, pays 16 dollars in transaction fees*
I would love to know if anyone will actually use Bitcoin to buy KFC, or if KFC are cashing in on free advertising from the recent crypto craziness

Do you understand what insider trading is?
It's someone having inside information (e.g. the X number of people who knew the date of BCC launch in Coinbase) passing that information **clandestinely** onto others.
Do you have any idea how easy it is to pass information without anyone detecting it? simple
NDA's, legality, etc doesn't matter. You have a confident, who passes the information to an unlinked friend, who passes that information to another unlinked friend. 4 years down the line they give you their take of the profit.
They could go through all the holdings, family holdings, email records, phone records of every employee who had foreknowledge of exact launch date and never find that information
I work in a company that handles v sensitive information. I could **easily** leak that info and they would **never** know it was me

They did announce it. And if an employee engaged in insider trading, it's not the companies fault - but it is their responsibility to investigate - which is what they've announced today

Every day there are leaks from major companies, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, Samsung, etc, etc, etc, etc
but this one HAS to be a conspiracy, right?
Think about it, Coinbase are swimming in money, it's not like they need to wreck their reputation just to make some bucks on BCC in some inside job.
You are one of the 20 employees who knows the date - think how much money you can make with that info. If you are dumb as shit you might get caught, but if you have half a brain, you can make serious cash and never be caught

Again. Coinbase is a company likely with hundreds of employees. Anyone working on the Bcash project could have leaked details (insider trading)
This is **very difficult** to stop in any company, and **even harder** to find the culprit
Why do people insist on trying to taint the whole company if one (or more) employees engaged in insider trading. Insider trading is damn hard to detect if someone does it right. 
Can happen to any company anywhere

My biggest and most realistic fear is global regulation. I don't think the market can ever move to zero (it can always go offshore), but the bigger it gets, the more regulators eye it up (vast tax evasion, cartels, insider trading, pump n dumps, etc)
Never a bad idea to sell a stack during a boom period in order to put into real estate (if it can be afforded)

Indeed they are a bit like "digital gold", but the speculative part is important to mention. Cryptos are very high on the risk spectrum.

People will spend eventually. There's no point dying with it if you can afford to use a portion to house yourself or to cover significant debt or help a relative
Many people have told me to cash out over the past 5 years, but I don't. However there will come a point when I will utilise it - I am not going to let it go to waste.
It can be used as a type of money - but it more closely resembles an extreme investment at the moment, which is why most are hoarding it and treating it as such
Also the whole "HODL" thing is mainly down to the fact that we don't want people to sell (decreases the value of our holdings) and we want more people to buy (at a higher price than we did) - it's the same psychology as a pyramid scheme

Worth a reminder: the "currency" that people don't spend, but cash out to fiat.

When Ethereum hit nearly 400 dollars back in June, there were quite a few people who sold a portion of their holdings to buy cars/pay off debts/property
When an investment reaches a certain price, people cash out to get something they've always wanted or cover debt or buy property
We all have our sell points. Ultimately we're all against the clock here. 
The paranoia and delusion here is extraordinary

The "currency" that people dont spend but speculatively hoard because it rises in value, then "cash out" (into real money) later
It already matches the market cap of some lesser world currencies but is so volatile business or industry can't use
This is the 800lb gorilla in the room that no one is talking about

I am very diversified (I think too diversified). It's definitely not good to have all eggs in one basket. Eth and LTC are a great idea, I also think Monero is a monster - it climbs so well and steadily. We could be at a peak now, it's hard to tell. All I know is that this market keeps throwing surprises and the best thing I've ever done is never try to play the market or second guess it.. just make a solid well thought out decision, stick to it, and if something goes downhill I never sell. I never want to be one of those people who has regrets and in crypto there's definitely a few

A great store of *speculative* value
