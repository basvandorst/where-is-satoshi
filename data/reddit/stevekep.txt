That 3.75% pisses me off.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:47:06
What's actually happening is I'm making fun of a specific set of anti crypto people on a pro crypto forum. 
Uh, your title says "Old people..." I believe 99% of everyone will take that to mean *all* old people.

So you don't/wouldn't use it but you recommend it? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:54:12
Just my opinion man, but really you come across as an self-important dick.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:33:25
If this is real,  DO NOT INVEST IN BITCOIN UNTIL YOU KNOW MORE!
If it's not real, it's just stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:17:44
If I had a retail store, I would accept bitcoin and put at least 10% of that money/coin aside. Let it grow.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:43:22
Yeah, I get it. I have to take him kicking and screaming to do any tech stuff. Got his first smartphone for his birthday this year. He fucking hated it...until he loved it. I gave him a really nice upgrade a month ago. Won't touch it, because he's comfortable with his $100 tracfone, lol. But he'll get there.
My dad was the same. The guy was a rocket scientist (really) and a PhD in toxicology,and  an unsurpassed thirst for knowledge, yet he wanted nothing to do with computers. Never could figure that one out. 
Thanks for the help and advice.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:38:10
How long did he have to wait for  confirmation?
Too soon?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:22:33
Been there, tried that. Came out about even, but I lined some minors pockets.
Edit: Miners lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:16:27
Thank you, I'll look into it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:38:07
Lose them for another 10 years.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:14:09
I imagine there are a lot of people like me. I'm older, I try to understand it, but I find it hard to grasp. The splits, block sizes, et al. If it's so easy to understand why are we paying  exorbitant fees and waiting hours for confirmation? I've bought stuff with it, I move it back and forth with other coins, etc. 
I don't understand code or how computers work, but yet I build my own computers. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:30
Hey, we just made a episode! (I want half the royalties, or I tell reddit!)
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:21:00
This is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:31:06
Is there a way he can check current value without having his coin on the net, or w/o having to do the math every time?
Let me try to clarify; I keep a % of what I own in my coinomi account ( a multiple of ten). This way I just go to coinomi to find the current value and just add the zero and I easily know the value.
And thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:17:56
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:19:30
I couldn't do that to my brother!
Or could I? lol

"We're going to seriously warn our employees NOT to make a quick killing in bCASH because that would just be wrong."
"Oh, they  did?" "We'll look into it".
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:11:02
And I'll hold you til I get confirmation.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:22:37
Does this mean moving/trading on coinomi will be lower fees and faster confirmations?
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:46:44
eventually 
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:50:20
Awesome of you, sry I'm late.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:37:53
Same computer but bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2014-06-17 09:48:36
Now I go check out your site!
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:11:10
 For now it should work, as we 'bitcoiners' are eager to embrace (and support) most anything bitcoin. The problem I see is that there are already myriad  tip addresses popping up everywhere, and when there is a tip address on every site...in short I think the novelty of using bitcoin and the  competition for tips will be the drawback. 
 Hope I'm wrong tho, love the site, my dad worked for NASA.
 
 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:19:29
Thank you. I am older and it is hard to figure out all this crap!
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:34:17
Yes, I installed it directly to the flashdrive.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:29:40
To make matters worse, you would have to be held captive for however long it takes for confirmation.
@_date: 2014-01-14 06:04:56
I use 2-step, but this just hit me...shouldn't the verification token be something other than just (7) numbers? More like a captcha?
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:24:37
The fact that coinbase had this exploit is FUCKING SCARY!
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:50:04
Criminals, especially white collar criminals, ALWAYS think they are smarter than everyone else.

@_date: 2014-02-26 20:22:01
Thank you. I moved wallet.dat to flash, is that good enough?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:17:08
Yes, it did sync. I just checked the blockchain and it went to the hard drive. Maybe becauce it's too big (8gb flash)?
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:33:54
How many people do you know that have only a HS diploma (or eqiv.) and don't have a record, and WANT to become a police officer? 
Such is the sad state of our law enforcement.

There was no crime before bitcoin, because cash is only for legal transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:01:43
High fee in my area. But thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:02:20
I'm looking into it, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:18:54
Shit! Should I have invested in chickens?

I was hoping the whole time that this commercial was airing that it was a bitcoin ad (because who would sponsor it?), but in my heart I knew it was to good to be true. Then, when  it was revealed as paypal, it was like et tu brute?
@_date: 2016-02-16 12:14:19
I would think 'extenuating circumstances' applies here.
@_date: 2016-02-16 10:40:11
Even this douchbag will probly send it back.
@_date: 2016-09-06 06:41:11
Bitcoin is simply still to difficult to use yet for the average person and the average transaction.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:22:23
Guess not.
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:49:01
You don't remember when bitcoin was up over $1,200 and dropped back to around $200?
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:00:31
Trumps intellectual equal.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:51:55
One year ago (Feb 1 2017) bitcoin was $972.59. It's currently $8,545.37. If that's the biggest bubble in history sign me the fuck up!
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:10:47
$31 million roughly
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:00:38
Thanks for explaining. As a newb looking for insight I put sooo much faith in the dumb shit I read; now, none at all.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:24:05
I would *way* trust a used car dealer before this guy. Look at that face!
Made me think of the old Creedence Clearwater song "Fortunate Son"
"Some folk are born, silver spoon in hand, 
"Lord don't they help themselves. 
"But when the taxman comes to the door, 
"The house looks like a rummage sale"

I've always considered golf to be physical chess; You're the only one on your team and you can be having a great game...but one bad move (shot) can fuck up the outcome. Oh...and there's *always* one bad shot (at least, lol). In other sports, you can fuck up the whole game and still be a hero in the end (interception, home run etc..), it just doesn't work that way with golf. 
In addition, you're out on this giant beautiful, manicured lawn where, depending on where you live, you might see a bear, and alligator or who knows what the fuck.

Bitcoin growing pains.
Congrats on being a homeowner!
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:42:51
Cool. Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:02:09
This is really cool/good news. Kids growing up with bitcoin. Yes!
@_date: 2015-03-07 04:25:18
I've been using tixati for years...
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:51:21
Not so sure bitcoin wants to be linked to these guys.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:12:36
I got one also, have not used btc-e in years.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:57:18
Hope you walk with great posture, or you might miss out on a lot of coin.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:27:04
If it's a restaurant, they can steal munchies at the same time.
@_date: 2015-02-17 06:08:14
Wouldn't touch them or any online poker fucks with a ten foot pole with a satochi at the end of it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:02:28
I think we should start a bet when somebody will try to steal this thing, or just break the glass. That's got to be a lot of $ worth of pot.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:24:47
Maybe you could get your cat addicted and have it go up in there, grab some buds.
@_date: 2016-07-22 19:59:59
Time to stop using coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-01 13:42:56
I should buy some MORE bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:25:06
Spending it on munchies.
