Even if he wins, he won't be able to create a coalition as other parties exclude Geert Wilders' Freedom Party. Best case he ends up a huge opposition party but not as the PM.

I fully agree. Screaming instead of debating. Pretty poor and embarrassing performance. I like Shiff but would be great if all the gold bugs would be more open to bitcoin as the other alternative to protect your 'wealth  ' they clearly have a business model to defend and is the reason of there skepticism. Matter of time that smart guys like Shiff, Jim Rickards will become more bullish on BTC.
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:14:49
This is disappointing. Bitcoin bug should have let Shiff say his thing debate him.

Let's find out. Latest polls coming in and VVD is closing in on Geert W. I expect Mark Rutte will continue his job as PM. As a Dutch man I'm doubting between these 2 parties. But I would only choose for Geert because of his less Europe policy. An expensive failed project. His anti Islam rhetoric is not my cup of tea.

Common practice for gold bugs to share such apocalyptic doomsday scenario's. To favor precious metals as the ultimate safe haven. I don't buy it.

I don't think regulation is the only factor. e.g. Yesterday the dollar declined significantly, making other currencies ( CNY ) stronger. Let's not forget that people in china, just like we do, try to make a few bugs. If their currency strengthens the are probably more likely to sell. It's called trading.

Oh my god, especially this part in the article worries me... 上周四比特币崩盘。截至正午（美国东部时间），比特币兑美元汇率在短短两个小时的疯狂交易中共下跌
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:44:52
"Some credit the Chinese government’s statement regarding bitcoin as a factor the price drop that occurred immediately after, with bitcoin values dropping up to 21% worldwide" .... (did the price really dropped AFTER the statement of the Chinese Government? I believe the statement was a result of the price drop that in my option was caused by a declining USD vs CNY. Typically ignorant talking heads copy pasting each other's BS. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:07:51
His take on how the Chinese government could react on Chinese population fleeing in BC is interesting... and of course what we hope for.

Which is not a bad advice to invest your money in multiple (non fiat) assets instead of putting all your eggs in one basket. But I admit, this blog strikes me as well as a sales pitch for Gold Money. But, I did open a Gold Money account recently, and you can purchase gold with BTC, so I'm positive about that kind of development. What still turns me off though, is that when I sold my gold investment, it took more then a week before the money was in my bank account. Especially this aspect will make more and more people turn to crypto currency like BTC. It only takes a few moments to move your money around the globe.

Dishonest Media bashing Bitcoin. Very bad.  ( Donald J. Trump ) did you see his tweet? ;) 
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:39:33
What is the USD going to do (against CNY)? Tank? Rise? What concrete trade barriers can we expect against China? This remains unclear until Trump is inaugurated. 
Interesting weeks ahead for BTC is my expectation

I became a better hodler because of the crashes. More confident after another episode. Crashes belong to bitcoin just as much as the ATH’s. Embrace it, buy when everyone is panicking, ignore the fud.

I've uploaden required docs for tier 3 verification as well. Status "in progress" for over a week. I've sent 2 email reminders before the finally responded. They have to manually process each request and apparently not enough manpower. Their service and follow up is pretty poor. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:36:36
I've done that. Sold after his "fork in the road" post. Scared the sh*t out of me. Lost a lot of money but I realize there is only one person to blame for that stupid trade I made -me-  I became a HODLer. Still pretty relaxed right know �� as I'm convinced what doesn't kill BTC, makes it stronger. This will make it stronger
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:55:00
What a master piece. And well documented. Compliments. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:25:54
On the other hand, if you learn the hard way, you'll become a better HODLer next time. I really mean that since I've sold to fast myself in the past believing the FUD stories. It's a learning process to stay relaxed an build confidence.

I used to listen a lot to his videos ( still do ) and also other ambassadors for gold mining companies. It's interesting to see that they can't ignore BTC / Crypto anymore in their narratives to remain credible. US Watchdog, X22Spotlight etc etc. all bringing on more guests that are talking about crypto. That's a good thing, let's move some more of that market into BTC. Matter of time also Peter Shiff jumps onboard ��
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:18:34
The exchanges are experiencing similar challenges as Bitcoin itself. Scaling. Relative young companies that are growing faster then they can handle. As long as they learn from it ( and I assume they will ) they will continuously improve. Just cope with it or stop using exchanges.

No, updating with latest firmware didn't work. But that was not putting my coins at risk since I was able to use the wallet without updating it.
