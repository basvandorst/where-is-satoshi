@_date: 2017-12-08 10:22:12
Whats the logic?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:21:51
i know just being too optimistic
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:47:44

@_date: 2017-12-08 11:47:55

@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:20

Bitcoin price watch, give me feedback to improve if you try.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:01
Thanks for reply, can you tell what didnt work, as i tested again on my friend's watch, its working!
Goto a watch face that supports complication with long text, like ring watch face, add complication names as Bitcoin price watch
As soon as you add complication it should show price.

all in all how much did you put from your pocket?

Hey guys, i did a withdrawal of btc from bittrex to a sender. Sender is saying transaction was returned back and this is link of that transaction but bittrex is saying they do not have control over how transaction is returned. My question is where did my btc vanished?
Link of transaction: 
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:00:36
Bittrex only sent me this link saying bittrex has no control over sending/return address.
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:04:49
It seems somehow transaction was returned automatically in 3-4 mins which can be seen from blockchain link. Recipient says it is returned from their end and transaction also looks like that but bittrex says they do not have control on how its returned.

an bitcoin survive so many transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:21:06
Thanks for great info, ill try to add these from api and also leave option of entering own fees, yes making it fluid is first priority.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:33:45
BTW updated its look and feel, and added few more features
Currently WIP...
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:34:23
Updated look and feel:

@_date: 2017-11-01 17:29:13
Thanks for input, which typo you referring to? Also fees is optional, in case user knows break even point he can chose to ignore fees fields.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:10:24
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:33:17
Ohh thats a great idea, ill add this one as well in calculator.
Any more ideas?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:24:32
Amazon will deliver product before BTC transaction in confirmed ;)
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:17:22
Noted, i was thinking to make it neutral and usable across various countries hence giving user freedom to enter values, but yes, maybe a future addon ! Thanks!
