Wrong. The gateways are responsible to fulfill their KYC/AML duties.

Ripple is centralized and the money supply may be inflated at any time.  There are similarities to ripple, but the fact that this is blockchain based with a fixed supply makes this instantly superior.

That's an event that will come and go. No non Bitcoin people will even think about it again. This Dotcom project will be very high profile and will be a Continuous use case which the media will tie to all sorts of illegal activity.  It may be the catalyst that forces regulators to criminalize possessing Bitcoin as they do drugs.  Or they will use it as such.

Fantastic response. Think hard about that one?  Why do so many people respond to a serious question by being a complete asshole?

WAVES is the answer. Fiat gateways in and out from any crypto. Forex trading. Margin trading for all. Off chain order matching with on chain settlements gives it security and lightning speed.  Those features will be active before October.

Lol. Good point.

Thanks for the heads up.  What are the reasons this happens?  Ive only made 3 posts EVER, and I dont think Ive broken any rules....

There is no option to add a credit card as a back up method any longer.  Only debit.
@_date: 2016-06-02 23:09:14
Too bad their fees for using a debit card are insanely high.  
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:37:10
Here is their official response. Basically debit is now the only options for instant buys with 3-4x higher fees.  
Hi there,
Thank you for contacting Coinbase support.
We have recently removed the ability to add credit cards to our system to enable instant buys. However, you can enable instant buys on your account by verifying a debit card with us. You can do so any time from our mobile app or by navigating to  on our website.
If you need any additional assistance, please let us know. We’re here to help!
Regards,

They don't want to ban it. They just want to investigate you for using it. As long as you're not doing anything wrong, you can carry on and feel perfectly safe and protected. (Sarcasm).

A decentralized internet like the MAIDsafe Safe Network can't come fast enough. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:50:31
Sounds to me like blanket authority to investigate anyone they think is trying to anonymize their internet behavior. Regardless of the methodology.

I was enrolled.  I used to have a credit card on there.  At one point, I got an email introducing me to the new Debit Card "features", so I added a debit card.  Now the credit card is gone along with my Instant Buys and I can't add it back...
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:43:48
That's been said only about 1000 times before you.  
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:01:19
I see.  So if I add a credit card it should return?
Edit:  The only options are Bank Account of Debit Card.  Debit Card is the only option that shows instant buys.  I'll never do that because my daily debit limits with my bank are low and Coinbase's fees are too high on debit purchases.  I guess there's nothing stopping me from moving over to Gemini now....

They spend $199k on a wine and cheese event in Delaware.  This means nothing.  They have 500,000 tests a year like this.

Considering it's near impossible to calculate cost basis for what can amount to hundreds of individual trades at different prices per trade, putting your best foot forward with the tools and knowledge available will be more than ok with the IRS in a market where 99% of the people think they are somehow skirting taxes.  
The issue with like kind transactions is that they have to have been reported all the way back to your first trade (to establish cost basis for FIFO) in order for it to ever be used at all.  Therefore, most people are fucked anyway.  
There will be examples made in crypto no doubt.  Including but not limited to complete forfeiture of the assets in question.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:50:19
You are completely incorrect to state this as fact.   The IRS has classified cryptocurrency as property.  Property trades can defer taxes through "like kind exchanges".   The IRS hasn't specifically stated that asses to asses trades are like kind exchanges but they haven't stated that they aren't either.  Most CPAs and attorneys I've spoken with believe that clause can be used in the case of crypto.

Stratis just released the breeze Wallet which anonymizes Bitcoin TXs using n-tumblebit.

Thank God he clarified that it was his actual left ball.  Nobody would have cared if it was his theoretical left ball.

So you want to further separate the branding of the blockchain (which is getting all of the attention) from Bitcoin (which needs attention to be successful)? That's a horrible idea.

The doubling of the price of BTC over the last 6 months has been the run up in anticipation to the halvening.  We've already seen the effects. Nothing major will happen in the months following the actual event in July.

I'm fairly certain he is creating his own crypto token. Not using Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:48:24
He mentions Bitcoin because it's the most known crypto by a long shot. The fact that he says Mega and Bitcoin are having a baby would indicate that it is an offspring...something new based on the Bitcoin tech.
