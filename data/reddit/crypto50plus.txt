I can’t believe we are a just a few weeks away from possible CBOE  ETF, huge news yesterday with Bakkt , Plus ETC next week and more coins later listing on Coinbase and the market dumps. RSI is totally oversold now , Market Cap now all the way down to$253 billion, I really hope this is just bears looking to lower price to buy in for the next big bounce because if we drop below $6800 support  it will be a massive sell off .  They are playing with fire because your right it will be a fire sale below $6800 !

Yes good time to buy more of everything while it’s dipping. It lowers your cost average and with Consensus 2018 starting 5/14 in NY everything is going up especially the alt coins that are big sponsors of the event. BTC should take off before , during, and after this event !

Have you guys noticed that every day around 5:00 pm EST that the market dumps, it has to be Wall Street taking daily profits before they go home for the night. It’s only on weekdays and has happened the last 3-4 weekdays in a row and on Friday’s it’s s bigger dump before they go home for the weekend.

Just noticed Coin Base is showing $8600 and Bitfinex is showing $8800., it’s usually the same or if anything Coin base is always higher . Have never Seen a $200 price difference.

The Rothschild’s or Soros just bought in LOL.

It doesn’t but you can see the orders from multiple exchanges, charts, volume (other than coin base) and what the buy/sell orders are lined up on each exchange. I may have misunderstood your question.

The way I look at is the last 3-4 months have been on the job crypto training, what to do and what not to do, who to believe and who not to believe . 
It was painful to go through all the ups and downs at the time ( kind of like boot camp for crypto) but once your on the other side and can become a wolf instead of a sheep it is now paying off and was so worth it !

The bears are exhausted from all the selling action we may make it this time . Go Bulls !
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:15:14
PLEASE BUY BTC and don’t let it die , if we can’t get a bull run soon the sell off will get worse and the market cap will go even lower and interest in BTC will get even lower. PLEASE buy more now , today , stop tethering and let’s get some positive excitement going for everyone  !  A nice sustainable bull run would be just what we need !

I’ll bet a lot of people got stuck in Tether, this is a good win for the Hodlers !

I’ve never had any issues with Coinbase and feel safer with them than anyone else and you can trade for lower fees on Coinbase Pro. When it comes to keeping your digital assets safe I don’t believe anyone is better than them.

Last chance to buy BTC under 6k , until the next 80 percent drop in a couple of years. Better get in and buy now before it’s to late !
