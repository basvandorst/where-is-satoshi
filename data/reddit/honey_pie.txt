You think that is mad... a 16 yr old couple can have sex but if they send nude photos to eachother they could be arrested for distributing child porn.

**bitcoin days destroyed is absolutely bullshit and you should damn well know it**

hey, there is a huge increase in the money supply, and it is massive % annual increase until at least 2013. So its not that people 'sold and sold', its that more BTC kept being pumped into the 'economy'. And that isn't going to change soon!

Just FYI, oink never required any payment, nor gave any benefit for it. They were voluntary donations. Those going after them were just making shit up. So i don't see how it would be any different w/ BC.
I think a better comparison would be with Wikileaks, as banks/paypal could shut down payment that would still be available in BTC.

Yes. Retailers using bitcoins? (and the volume of trade being done there?)
**Why should a bitcoin that hasn't been spent in a year be worth more than one that was spent yesterday??** Bitcoin days destroyed may attempt to solve **ONE** issue against using 'total bitcoins transferred' (that is, it stops someone jacking up this number by wizzing bitcoins back and forth 1000 times an hour), but it is still utterly useless as an attempt to measure the 'bitcoin economy'.
Ulimately, it does not meet the standard required to be of any use. And the fact that there might not be anything 'better' to hand does change this, or make it worthy of mentioning.
*Genuine Question:* Did you actually think about this? and not see the massive gaping flaws in this?? REALLY??

7m BTC ~a month ago. add 7000 * 30 means currently ~7.21m.
7000 * 365 = 2.555m
2.555 / 7.21 = **35% increase in money supply over the next twelve months.**

It's not invalid. The system is *massively* rigged to the very earliest adopters.  
If things take off, a couple of people will become billionaires (already multi-millionaires) for running their computers for a few months. That is not a reasonable risk/reward relationship.

This is so wrong it hurts.

No, they aren't. They are between 1-2%. I know this from personal experience; I have recently started a business and managed to get a rate of 1.4%, for a brand new business with no trading or CC history. Turnover of $1m + should get you rates of 1%, and i'm sure the big players in the online world (amazon, newegg, etc etc) will be getting 0.5% or lower. As i said Debit Cards are usually done on a flat cost per transaction.

but if you are brutally honest, yes it has massive potential, but that isn't being met today, and there are no significant signs of it yet.

Lol. hilarious. good to see you understand things well.

I totally agree with everything you said-- except, that i don't see there is a solid link between being an early miner (that gets all the money) and all these other things (that adds real value to BC).
Also, i'm not sure how accurate your google analogy is.. it started as a university project... but in your scenario, that $1000 would have done a lot of enabling /speeding up of google to grow into what it is today.

IIRC it was ~£300k. People loved oink!

I've noticed this often happens whenever anyone mentions the possibility that bitcoin isn't a bottomless money printing machine for everyone involved, regardless of the accuracy or thought of the post.

How is it different from paying cash?
There is this weird logic sometimes here that BTC enables tax avoision.. but so does cash, it's no different.
