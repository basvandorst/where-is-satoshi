There should only be 8 articles on Reddit at a time, and the article slots should be sold to the highest bidders.  That would ensure high-quality articles.
What, you thought your post about your cat dancing in was important enough to go on *Reddit*, 'the front page of the Internet'?  I don't think so!
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:46:37
I thought it would take off.  It can't take off with the transaction limit as it is.  If every bitcoin user made twice as many transactions, or if every bitcoin user got another person to use bitcoin, it'd cause huge problems.
How can you expect bitcoin to go viral when this kind of restriction's in place?  Without more users soon, it'll probably end up being strangled by regulation and remain a minority interest only.

Yes, but why are there so many posts?  It's a tremendous strain on Reddit's servers.  And what if they want to relocate to somewhere without broadband Internet?
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:32:47
Go and look at other bitcoin discussion groups.  Go and look at what miners and industry say.  It's not just Reddit who want higher block size limits.  Even Satoshi planned to have removed the block size limit by now.  It's ludicrous that we even have to have this discussion.
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:49:40
I don't think so.  Maybe that's the way Satoshi wrote it originally, but the block chain deserves it's own word, like any number of words from history that became so common we mashed them together.
I'm no fan of people spamming careless-mistake-ridden text everywhere and saying "language is constantly evolving lol" about it when challenged on it, but I don't think this applies here.

2MB is no good.  2MB is what it should have been a year or two ago.
If you're a large business looking to transfer money between your subsidiaries and offices, you're not going to invest in a bitcoin solution for it as it might not continue to scale.  And it doesn't look like litecoin is interested in scaling either, so you'd invest in a custom solution (or just not use crypto at all).

1 mBTC = 1 milli-Bitcoin = a thousandth of a Bitcoin
1 µBTC = 1 micro-Bitcoin = a millionth of a Bitcoin.
BitPay decided that 1 bit = 1 µBTC.  I think this is a stupid name, as people already call Bitcoin 'bit', especially in South Korea and Japan.
Better to call µBTC "uBits" in my opinion.  Less scope for confusion then.

I think the bigger issue is that a million 'bits' is a bit coin (Don't expect the public to use proper capitalization or spacing!)
People are going to call 'bits' bit coin, and they're going to call Bitcoin bit coin.  It's going to cause a world of confusion, and people are going to get scammed.
The good thing about uBits, is that you don't even need to know it's a micro-Bitcoin.  Tip someone uB 600 for a funny comment, pay uB 300K for your rent, it's all good.

Learn C.  Use the white K&amp;R book.
C is what the Bitcoin code uses, and most altcoins are derived from the Bitcoin code.
After learning C, look through the Bitcoin code and try to understand it.  Then look at some altcoins' code and see how they're different, and how they're the same.

I don't think it was to avoid ddos per se.  It was to avoid spam.  The justification seemed to be "No-one's using all this 32MB capacity for real business so let's just cut it to 1MB for the moment.  Then once people really start using bitcoin and we have SPV wallets, we can raise the limit no problem"

What does this mean?  Can someone translate into proper English?
@_date: 2015-07-06 02:12:08
*the* blockchain, or, blockchains

I don't know who or what JUA is.  And what about 11 seconds?
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:47:53
Is it?!  That's news to everyone.  I thought only part of it was closed source, like 5 months ago.  And it's not called Darkcoin any more.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:24:00
Well it's no fun if he deletes his comment :-/
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:27:08
Why'd you write a custom forum?
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:46:45
It's not 7 really.  It'd be 7 if all transactions were the minimum size they could possibly be, which is unrealistic.
Wouldn't there have to be some time after the software update, to make sure that everyone's using the new software?  (To avoid serious forking)

Better hope it doesn't while we can only have 2 tps.

Get ready to start seeing "I donated 2 bit coins to this puppy on facebook and now i don't have any bit coins left, i thought i had 2 million where did they go"

Which mixer or exchange is trustless?
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:23:10
So the amount of blocks on top of it DOES affect the security of the confirmation?  Because people in keep saying it's only about the time, not the number of blocks.
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:39:34
So what did the person who knew about Bitcoin payments say?

What do you mean, 'not valid'?  It exists, it happens, it does it.  How can it not be valid?
@_date: 2015-09-15 15:29:16
*to limit spam, you should say.
Hardly anyone was really using bitcoin at the time so it made sense to put this temporary limit in place.
(Does anyone know if Satoshi ever explicitly said he wanted it to be temporary?)
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:41:48
The code, you mean.  And consensus.  It's not really some complicated mathematical expression in the code that decides how many bitcoins are released each block.
@_date: 2015-04-18 10:37:08
Meh, I don't really care to watch the processes involved in Quality Assurance.  Wonder why they didn't just hold a Q&amp;A session instead.

Your grandmother says "WHAT DEAR?  There are a million bit coins in a bit coin?"
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:10:18
Most cryptos are scams so stay away from that bitcoin thing.
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:44:16
@_date: 2015-04-11 13:40:25
OK so the number of blocks is a significant factor?  Because some people here keep saying it isn't.
@_date: 2015-03-11 02:12:57
But miners get new bitcoins from mining too -- the block reward.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:03:55
Any particular reason it's a scam?  Or is that just a thing to say?
@_date: 2015-03-24 11:59:49
Sounds like a lame excuse to me.  They could at least make the 'other ways to give' button more prominent.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:02:13
Don't call them blockchain please.  That company is trying to co-opt the good reputation of the blockchain and it's confusing people.  Call them blockchain.info instead.
And I wouldn't use their wallet; they've had security issues.  Electrum's best for desktop.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:08:18
RemindMe! 18 months How are those altcoins doing?

I don't get it.  Is 250Bit a custom moniker?  Why?
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:30:32
So where are these micropayment articles of which you speak?
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:32:44
What is it that makes Dogecoiners think Bitcoin is so staid anyway?  Do they think we wear suits and ties while using it?
