So hard to forget about nowadays. I love the news and bitcoin is all over it. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:55:10
You should make this it's own post.

No doubt tragic kingdom, 1995/s, and I keep looking at the chart and thinking "Wow $hit!", what else could I achieve with this investment that I actually believe in! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:24:19
You're right. There's this immediacy with btc that I feel,though, you know. If I jump off then I'll miss the next boat/rocket. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:55:30
It's weird because I feel over invested even though it is all profits...
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:16:14
How do you just stop? I guess I'm not used to feeling this type of security. Which is why the thought of losing it is unnerving. Honestly, it feels a lot like a gamblers high.

Where are people buying BCD?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:45:19
I think you might be right. Feels like such a bad time, though. I'm still thinking 50k by year end.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:09:56
Thank you for clarifying. We all need enlightenment at some point and it seems I might have over reached in calling myself a "hodler". I will never forget those veterans that have come before me. Keep up the good work./s

Life is a wild ride, no doubt tragic kingdom, 1995! This has been such a wild year. Even without the $$, though. My circle all knows about my bitcoin investment so for whatever reason I feel like I don't want to be laughed at for hodling. Does that make any sense? "The value is more than monetary at this point?"
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:43:48
That's what goes through my head a lot! Except with an "L"!
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:42:41
I already do this as part of my "regular" routine. I am a Man.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:48:39
This one word that you typed runs right through me every time I read it. I don't know if it was a joke, but it made feel calmer several times today. Some people hate to be told to "Relax". I don't get told this often. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:36:54
Just delete my price app, you think?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:54:04
I'm gonna need to pull a bit out if I go with this option. And that might be the right thing for me to do. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:46:31
Thanks, guys. Wow! Some nice words of suggestion. I half expected to get slammed. Good to see this sub can still be human.:)
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:52:23
 I am married. Sex is covered. Your comment made me think about how I could possibly be doing other productive things. Not to be "poor for the rest of my life", but maybe invest in a job change? Maybe something I might find more fulfilling? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:05:20
Just impossible to pretend BTC doesn't exist at this point. She's everywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:47
I actually just buy every time I take a poop.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:40:10
Then stop f asking me!

Unbelievable, this guy.

Love Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:45
Guys, chill out. This same drop happened like two weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:07:36
Back up

What is "bitcoinmillionaire"? I need something new to check every 5 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:21:20
"Can" being the operative word.

 Consumers are confronted with the idea, that their dollar is worth more than it's current value/industries have to adjust to consumers being more discerning with their savings and become more hyper tuned to consumer's current interests. Progress.

Goodbye, Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:26
Gemini gives you instant access to money for trading from your debit account via a credit. Takes a few days to clear, though.

We like short names. So here we go. : BB's= .01. B's is .1 and 1 BTC is, you know 1 BTC.

"Sandwich" part cracks me up!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:24:19
Thanks. I could see this helping. Any other ways?

Not sure if I want to be like you, poor4ever.

Welcome to crypto. This shit happens. BTFD

Can we fund folks to write these plug-ins?

I've played this game a few times before. Must have balls of steel! We'll cool off soon.
