I am not sure about that, for one thing I suspect the next hard fork could be coded in such a way that future block size limits changes will only require a soft fork.

That constant stupid music is awful, so 10 years ago and it was awful back then. Anyway time stamped links to the bitcoin bits.

My request is for "CoinWallet.eu" and the like to stop doing stress tests. I am afraid its a thing now, some c**ts will probably do on bitcoin black friday to make a point.

Strange decision. If he fights his best case scenario is to beat having the book thrown at him and only go to jail for some minor charges. Like if he proves he wa not an owner but only an employee he still broke the law but would get less than the max sentence. 
 Smells like a plea deal.  
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:48:48
Man all these 731kb blocks are daft. That value should default to the max block size and even as is minners should take the time to lift it. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:21:05
Its still a valid question. If bitcoin core committers reject it will users and miners come to it by patching core or switching to xt? if the later what does that mean for core? Or does Gavin make his own implementation or does Gavin revoke commit access to the non cooperative core committers?
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:09:13
Or they are about to release a bitcoin backed investment product.

Oh cool! even when I saw the trailer I was like meh, but Rottentomatoes usually gets it right, I find it the best indicator or film quality. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 23:50:33
Gives miners too much power, not as good as MaxBlockSize = 3x avg of last 2016 blocks and Gavin is said to be soon to release an improved version of his proposal that I expect will be better than bip 100.
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:25:05
And we have a test net. People like me are trying to live our lives on this network. I wish they would not treat it like an object on which to having pissing contest.

You take care of showing them how to get bitcoins for their government currency in Taiwan then hand them over to rebit.ph and coins.ph 
Those service do bitcoin to philippine peso in fils for about 0.5%!

lol video is extremely "local". Maybe the problems in Wyoming started when law-makers got him into explain it!

No this is perfect stunt for PRC, the house takes a % of turnover (they changed it this year)
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:35:55
Its not clear which side of that the current stress testers are. Certainly if you trust CoinWallet.eu you are off your meds. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 00:14:24
yeh-nah-yeh comment was meant to refer to core committers, those that actually have a say if a bip gets implemented.

WTF is safello? An exchange/wallet?

What a combination of the future (bitcoin) and the past (newspapers). I live in the Philippines and I can count on one hand the amount of people I have seen reading a newspaper in the last 12 months...still more people than I have met who have bitcoin though :(

Being okay with something does not necessarily mean he thinks it is the best possible option.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:05:53
731 kb blocks being considered "full" is most definitely not the natural state of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:58:14
I have not heard any other core committers say anything about BIP 100
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:38:41
3*8=24 
And a lot of other optimisation will be implemented in between now and when we would be filling 8mb blocks that will let them hold much more than that.  
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:41:49
There is no reason to think CoinWaller.eu has the best interests of bitcoin at heart, I suspect the oposite.  
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:52:39
Wow, a year ago my [Melbourne Australia meetup]( would have been in that list for sure, it seems to be going backwarks :(

The question is are Indonesians the type to listen to and worry about such BS. I am afraid the answer is probably yes.
@_date: 2015-06-21 12:38:39
Shocking, who could have possibly foreseen problems at OKCoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:11:38
Thats not cool, this ~~pissing contest~~ stress test is a bad idea. I would not be surprised if the same shady group thought it would be a good idea to do it again on bitcoin black friday to really ~~piss on us~~ make a point!

The lightning network developers explain why they need bigger blocks in this podcast.
About 55 minutes in, I put a comment at the timestamp 
@_date: 2015-06-21 23:07:22
by 2037 there will have been a lot more improvements on bitcoin. Even without any development we can X10 tps by going to 1 minute blocks. 
Also internet of things machines are perfect candidates for off chain transactions, settling on the chain only when a bill is due perhaps, which is normally monthly. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:53:29
I am not happy because I don't support bip 100 as I prefer Gavins new BIP.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:34:53
I support the change but I am not sure if bitcoin-XT, run by Mike Hearn, is the best place to do it. I would rather see it in any of these 3.
1. Bitcoin core.
2. Gavin makes his own implementation with a co-developer and that becomes the reference version.
3. Gavin leads an MIT Digital Currency Initiative implementation and that becomes the reference version.

Celery is getting some love
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:14:42
I wish we wouldn't. People like me are trying to live our lives on this network, it's not an excuse for a pissing contest.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:03:31
If a bip that the vast majority of the bitcoin community support does not get in to the code it could be considered a failure of the BIP process. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:13:45
I agree this has major benefits and only very minor downsides. I guess its a nice 10 X scalability tool to have in the back pocket for later. Let's get larger blocks in first. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:31:21
The second half is Peter Todd's serious objections to the dangers of all possible proposals. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:50:59
Or one could say if bitcoin xt becomes the reference then core has failed due to the BIP process and therefore the BIP process has failed.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:44:42
I make my all my income in bitcoin and also have an ideological problem with government currency. 


Bull shit, we need a tps capacity increase now and we already new that
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:40:27
Hopefully this will get into core anyway.
