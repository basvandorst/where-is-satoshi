Someone explain with $100,000 to invest on how this works numerically. What happens if bitcoin goes up or down? How do yo make money or lose money?

Today was a good day for being greedy. Lots of panic sellers. The highs and the lows have been crazy. Hold on for dear life. The longs are not interested in selling right now.

It's always had a premium in between 25-70%, but this is getting pretty ridiculous. The main thing is that it's the only option for an IRA tax free retirement bitcoins and actual bitcoin holdings in the stock market. Everyone holding already could care less, but if people ask, it's better to buy bitcoin directly. The premium will always be there due to market scarcity, but could correct somewhat at some point. Unless bitcoin tapers off i expect it to stick around. It's way too risky to bet against this one.

I pay the most attention to the ratios on price now. Eth/ltc was about 5/1 and is now near 2/1. If one pulls away I may reallocate, but up front ltc has been catching up on the ratio.

Cash today or $5000 more next week. Wait for the next all time high. It's Christmas though. Your call.

How big is the short position in the market on gbtc? I am guessing this is due to a short squeeze. With the way it's been going, shorting gbtc is absolutely retarded until another etf comes online. Once that happens, then maybe. No one wants to sell gbtc right now though.

Just don't sell today.

Any other options to buy more today? $750 was the max on coinbase for the week and that was Friday.

Is hodling the equivalent of Hodor holding onto your investment to keep the naysayers at bay?
