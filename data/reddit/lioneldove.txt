If you get fired and can’t find a job within 6 months then you’re fucking clueless at your job.

Check out JP Morgan coin. Right up your alley.

People are re-fillin their bags and shorts are getting rekt.

Hopped up on Mountain Dew and Goofballs tonight are we? 
If you can’t handle the rollercoasters stick to the fuckin teacups.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:06:20
Sorry you sold at $8000. Maybe you’ll get lucky and it’ll dip further and you can buy back in.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:46:06
It’s hilarious how many people can’t use basic logic yet they think they’ve got BTC cracked.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:08:54
How high do you think it will go before it’s basically gone or replaced?

Fiddy Sat
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:42:36
And how would the price remain at 1k if we had mass adoption?
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:52:34
@_date: 2019-07-13 04:30:12
Shit. Better sell it all.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:38:50
So 2 months ago you were saying sell when BTC was $8000, then it went up to $14000 6 weeks later. 
This fucking sub.
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:49:46
Missed the dip

Have you lived in a county with a socialised healthcare system? 
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:03:10
That’s precisely what I thought. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:23:40
I hope so because I want to accumulate more. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:41:10
I thought a nonce was a British pedophile. You live and learn!
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:40:24
50K will be when the fomo really starts to kick in.
@_date: 2019-06-07 06:29:57
In your dreams.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:42:26
Wait for 10k
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:56:51
There will be no hype until $50k +
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:48:22
Yes, sarcasm. Just buy the damn bitcoin and stop trying to time the market. 
If you bought at 1500 you’d be laughing. If you bought an 3200 you’d be laughing. If you buy at 9000 you’ll be laughing if it hits $100,000. 
Nothing is guaranteed but I, along with many many other people believe that we’re standing at the base of massive all time high.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:22:40
Oh hai Tone xx
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:36:26
Actually saying you sold is a great strategy. I might do the same.

Pea Island? Looks more like Piss Rock.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:03:07
$1200 for a single bitcoin? LOSERS.
@_date: 2019-06-02 18:46:15
Seems like OP’s goal should be working a job they actually enjoy.

Or if you're in Scotland it's "HAWD-L"
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:41:29
For sure. I DCA’d in after getting my arse rekt on some horrible ICO decisions in 2017 and I’ve dug myself out into a nice profit.
Technology or not I believe that crypto is THE investment opportunity of our lifetime. I was too young to miss the first dot com boom and too broke to take advantage of the second. 
This is our break and I’m fucking taking it.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:40:24
I’ll take the number 3 please.

Not now honey, the adults are talking.
@_date: 2019-04-19 01:04:19
Nah dude. The FOMO is real. It won't go sideways for 5 years until it's fully adopted.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:50
Thanks for your utterly pointless story. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:19:06
Sorry for pointing out that your post was pointless.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:40:17
It’s true. I called him out for a pointless post. You called “us people” salty. We’re having a discussion....one of very little value but a discussion none the less. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:30:34
No you implied that any discussion about bitcoin was pointless. To double down and say every post on reddit is pointless is even more ridiculous. Not sure why you’ve such an issue with my statement. Or “us people” whoever that is? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:25:05
All post about Bitcoin are pointless? I disagree. 
Writing a post that amounts to  “I sold bitcoin at $14,500 and I feel happy” is pointless and I called it out. Not sure why you’re getting your penis in a twist over it. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:58:45
Real fomo will come at $30K
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:59:32
You can buy them on amazon already 
The gold ones will go up in price the most yeah?
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:01:25
Perfect. Fomo at $35K...ATH $100,000.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:34:19
You’re probably totally right. I just find it hard to believe . It seems so obvious.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:29:26
Yeah...even the ones that were really into it at the tail end of the last bull run have lost interest. They thought I was insane when I started loading up again at the sub-4K levels.
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:08:23
I feel like I’m late to the party.
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:52:07
Yeah....I knew it was a glitch but it looked damn good anyway. A little taster.

$1,000,000 by June while we dance to Hodl-step on the Milky Way.
