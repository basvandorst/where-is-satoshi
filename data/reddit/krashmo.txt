The way I understand it is that you open a channel to the lightning network and then conduct transfers off the blockchain until it is economical or otherwise necessary to record the many transactions you made on the blockchain. That way lots of small transactions can be processed like one big transaction. I believe there are miners verifying transactions on the LN as well.

Mainstream adoption of another form of payment is the biggest hurdle in the downfall of the traditional banking system.

It's been in development for a while. I'm not sure on a timeline for it though. I think litecoin has a lightning network already in use so you should be able to find info on how it works if you are interested.

It is used as a payment system, just not a very effective one. However, the problems you referenced are being actively worked on as we speak. Different opinions on how to solve them are how we ended up with the off shoots of bitcoin that now exist.

Definitely. I tried to create an account there so I could show some support but they said I already had one. Turns out I had an account I forgot about and haven't used since 2009. They wouldn't have gotten my business without bitcoin.

The number of coins is not doubling, there will just be two different blockchains keeping track of transactions. If you have bitcoins on a wallet you control, you will be able to use your coins on both forks. However, one of the forks will likely wither away and die quickly, in which case, we are back to where we are now (aside from any protocol changes that are made).

There's one in this very thread.

They outlawed Internet piracy a long time ago and that didn't stop hardly anyone from doing it. Cryptocurrency as a technology, maybe Bitcoin specifically and maybe not, is going to play a huge role in the future of financial transactions. Those who benefit from stifling it will try, as they always do, but they can't stop it unless they get rid of the internet altogether.
