Who cares what this dinosaurs has to say about crypto? It's like an expert boxer would commentate on mixed martial arts. His achievements as an investor does not make him fit to judge crypto. He simply has no knowledge about the subject and no one should put him on a pedestal. Think of it like this, there's three major aspects of crypto. Tech, economics and politics. Buffet understands economics and probably politics. He has no f-ing idea how the tech works and because of that he has no f-ing idea how Bitcoin will disrupt economy and politics. End of story.

Tech: Follow the developers on twitter  and as mentioned in previous posts, watch Antonopolous on youtube.
Investing: 1. Buy trezor or ledger nano. 2. Buy as much and as often as you can, but not more than you're comfortable losing. 3. Hodl (hold it securely). 4. NEVER sell all your bitcoin for crappy fiat or go pro by never selling any of your bitcoin ever :)

Don't feel bad. It's them acceptering that "if you can't beat them, join them". All news articles regarding bitcoin is good, because all publicity is good publicity. As long as bitcoins fundamentals are the same, bitcoin remains anti-fragile. Cheer up and enjoy the ride.

The volatility decreases with adoption. The scaling increases with technological advancement, like the lightning network. There is no need for local currency. Zero. Nada. Nothing. No need at all.

Digital money didn't work without a central authority governing it. Satoshi Nakamoto solved double-spending. Digital money now works decentralized. It's revolutionary. It's going to change the world. It's going to make you rich. Do your own research. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

People switch to bch and all kinds of altcoins. That's exactly what bcash or bitcoin cash is. You can call it that or a fork. There has been many forks. Bcash is just one of them. If you're new to this space, stick to the real bitcoin. If you're obsessed with this space, stick to bitcoin. Most people do an unnecessary journey and some get lost in the altcoin jungle. Bitcoin is the best, the rest is just noice and mostly scams even. Even ethereum. It's all shitcoins. If someone complains about bitcoin it's usually about the slow progression it's having. The problem is that there are no quick fixes. We can absolutely not compromise on bitcoins immutability and security. Now the lightning network is evolving ultra rapidly and it's becoming increasingly clear that second layer solutions will make not just regular fiat money such as the US dollar obsolete, but also the entire crypto currency space, excluding bitcoin. Buy. Hold.

It's relative. It depends on the buyers entry point. I like that this posts highlights that if bitcoin could go from $1 to $10, from $10 to $100, from $100 to $1000 it can go from $6581.62 to $1 000 000 000

It's basic. Technology improves with time. Improved technology, among other things, increases adoption. Volatility decreases with adoption. A currency shouldn't be volatile, that's why Bitcoin is considered an asset. Give it time and it will be considered a currency or both. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:08:11
Adoption is far from 100 %. The volatility will remain and purchases won't be a good idea unless you always replace your fiat with btc at the same time. I think this is the reason bitcoin is getting viewed as a store of value right now, rather than a currency. It's almost like bitcoin can be whatever we want it to be. Lighting will transform "gold" to practical cash, in a sense. Just as cash has been backed by gold before, but today it's of course backed by nothing. This innovation together with a stable price, seen far in the future, will make bitcoin not just an investment, but a logical payment option. With further development and adoption we will have everything we are dreaming about. It's just a matter of time. We don't have to buy products with bitcoin today. It's the store of value that's attractive in this stage, in my humble opinion. We will buy coffee with bitcoin and it will be logical, but it's not logical today and I think we're focusing on the wrong attribute of the technology in this rather early stage of adoption.

Bitcoin is alive and stronger than ever. If you had been involved years ago you would have seen this fact clearly now. I know I'm a random person on the Internet telling you this, but I want you to relax. The first time I invested was before the last bear market. It was mentally tough, but I focused on the development of the technology, not the drama in the crypto space or the price. It gave me hope and a deeper understanding of bitcoin. You need one thing... It's patience.
