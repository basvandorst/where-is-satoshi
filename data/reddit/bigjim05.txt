Innocent until proven guilty mantra applies to criminal law, not civil law (ie money related).  Hence why civil asset forfeiture is happening in mass, and why we need bitcoin to get us out of this mess.  Gold won't work because it can also legally be confiscated since it physically resides in the jurisdiction and therefore is also subject.

Bitcoin is extraordinarily useful as money.  Tulips are not.  Money cannot by definition in and of itself be a bubble.  If you prefer FRNs as a store of value, you are being defrauded.

I can say that faith in the USA and the USD used to be a good thing.  If you didn't know what you want to do with your life, going for the money is generally a safe bet.  So money in its principle (a ledger with your fellow man) is a good thing.  However the USD has been corrupted such that going after it has turned more and more of a bad thing.   I believe bitcoin fixes that.

They'd immediately freeze your assets and/or seize them with SWAT.  Then civil forfeiture laws would force you to prove the 'innocence' of the funds.  Then the govt will ultimately get them, which was their plan all along.
FRNs (aka 'USD's) are really no better than counterfeit tethers.  For some reason all that matters is confidence in  the balance sheet.  Take the US gold reserves for example.  They aren't there either yet the same number has been touted for decades.

During the 2000s, the Fed was shutting down every digital currency it could even the tiny ones.  Back then it was mostly DGCs (digital gold currencies).  They'd shut them down calling them unlicensed money transmitters and confiscate any backing assets such as gold.  So bitcoin is a natural evolution of that, with nothing to confiscate, and decentralized like the P2P bittorrent.  The Feds cannot shut it down or they would!  So instead they have a different tactic where it's legal but they downplay it.
The NSA would like for you to believe they invented it, but no way they did and put it out in the wild like that plus criticizing bank bailouts.  As for using SHA256, it was at the time one of the most secure, still is to this day, plus has those "no hands up my sleeve" numbers so it's relatively trustworthy that there is no intended backdoor.  It seemed to me the algorithm to use back then, and even now.
I'm annoyed when people think something like bitcoin came from the hands of destroyers and not from true creators.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:22:23

@_date: 2018-01-23 20:29:32


Tether serves as a very useful token, in arbitrage and as a bridge between the current fiat system and crypto.  The use case for tether is very strong, and it must exist.  They can also be extraordinarily profitable without having to be fraudulent.  As for an audit, as soon as they publish one their accounts are likely to be frozen by the fiat moneymasters, so they are probably doing the best they can.
Anyway, I agree it sucks, but I can't think of a way to build something better.


Probably because they wish to reenter the crypto market at some point soon.

Of course.  This isn't hard to do with just about any business, and especially with what they are trying to do.


The exchanges and whales that do business with tether are confident they can exchange tether for fiat, and they are the ones who need to, you don't.


They should probably take some time to iron out the process of exactly how they are going to do that.  I suspect the founders did not realize how difficult the task is when they first proposed this.  I for one have never trusted tethers because it doesn't really matter if the fiat is there.  The Powers That Be will move and seize the funds at whim and when it will cause the most damage to the crypto community.  I knew that from the beginning.
But for the time being, tethers are serving their purpose, and honestly I trust the Federal Reserve even less.


Do you remember what happened to e-gold?  Why would bitgold's fate be any different than all the DGCs of the 1990-2000s?
Tether has a difficult task.  I don't think we can ever be sure just how solvent they are, but I suspect they are mostly solvent, and all this FUD is a way to attack their credibility (and the whole crypto market) until the Powers That Be know where to go after freezing/stealing their funds.

The contrarian theory is not always correct.
You have to consider the much broader market.  Sure, most people in bitcoin are expecting the bull run to continue, however when you consider the 99% of the rest of the world, it will catch them completely off guard and they will FOMO in.  So in a sense, being already in bitcoin is the overall contrarian view.

Buy a gold ring, possibly with a gemstone of actual resale value.  Save your money in BTC and \*you\* be responsible for it, not the woman.   I wouldn't even talk to her about that.

This is wrong.  M3 is M1+M2+dollars held outside the USA financial system (so-called "eurodollars").  Not "long-term deposits" whatever that was supposed to mean.  M3 is no longer being reported because that is the most critical and where the vast majority of the dollars and dark pools of money printing are sitting on the sidelines waiting to re-enter the system.  Not knowing the money supply or whether or not it will be expanded or contracted is the key advantage the feds &amp; their friends have over the rest of us.

Anyway my point is the poverty you are speaking about that will turn dangerous is a result of the corruption and misallocation in the existing system as its declining, whereas crypto is the solution.

That's because it really doesn't matter what you invest in (in the existing system) because ultimately it's a casino where you will get taken.  No traditional market exclusively follows supply vs demand anymore because the value of investment funds that can be stolen also comes into play from the private traditional (forex, comex, equities, etc.) exchange servers.  Same thing bitfinex is trying to do but can't because of arbitrage to other exchanges (which used to exist across exchanges in traditional Western finance but no longer).

Yes, we are headed to a dystopian economic environment because of the massive fraud the old system has perpetrated on everyone and when it goes everyone who is not already on the new system (ie non-crypto holders) will indeed suffer.
You are already parroting the "it's bitcoin's fault" BS which is absolutely not true.  It's the fault of those who continue to trust a fraudulent system.

It's anyone's guess when a significant collapse will happen.

@_date: 2018-08-18 00:44:41
I agree.  This idea occurred a long ago to me, but does it matter?  Maybe all that matters at any one time is the currency in circulation.  If some whale of old comes in with 100,000 bitcoin and starts spending it, all it does is cause a small bit of inflation while at the same time redistributing more bitcoin.  Not a problem compared to what we have today with the fed, who basically has an infinite amount of dollars they are sitting on and can spend at any time.

That may be true, but mobile wallets can easily work around this.  I can already receive payments with the bitcoin lightning wallet app, and with watchtowers and other services I won't even need to be connected to receive payments at all, or even generate invoices.
The problem as I see it is that currently you must have a lightning channel open before you can send/receive.  That means you must have bitcoin first.  Channel factories might solve the latter problem, but I think Eltoo is supposed to solve the former.  It's coming, and with an ETA I'd have a good idea when the next bull run is coming.

If I ever go back to the US, I'll be on food stamps, get disability, file some lawsuits every time I get offended, have a job that pays cash or corp-to-corp, then put it all in bitcoin so I have nothing on paper.  I'll default on all my unsecuritized debts, rent not own, don't pay any health insurance or healthcare, just freely use whichever hospital I want.  I'll never be at the address I have on paper, and never will be served again.  And learn every other trick in the book which they throw at the middle-class.

I think most people here would answer Yes.  Even if crypto goes back to sub-dollar levels I'll still be using it because I believe in sovereignty of the money I make.

I feel the real thing that's needed with LN is the ability to receive funds without having had bitcoin (or a channel open) already.  In other words, download the wallet app and immediately be able to receive an LN payment.  The onchain stuff can happen later in the background.  Also, I can currently receive LN payments on my phone but only up to what is available in my open channels.  Since my channels are still relatively full (haven't spent much), I can only receive a small amount until the channel(s) top off again.  This limitation is also a problem.  But imagine a world where these two limitations have been addressed!
Take Venezuela or Africa.  They would be using LN right now if it weren't for the fact that you must own bitcoin first and then lock it up in a channel.

A lot of coins also have designs oblivious to the limitation of computation and network resources.

Zero.  Actually I cashed out of the real estate bubble, paid 8% to the realtors, and took the money and bought a house in Mexico cash.  I live here now and love it.  My property taxes are about a hundred dollars per year.  If I miss a year it's no big deal.  And this covers street repair and trash pickup 3 times/week.  If I miss a bill they just turn service off, and turn it back on when you pay the bill (no late fees, no interruption charges).

I had a similar problem, but was eventually able to get set up with Coinbase Pro.  I needed my US Passport, which I was able to "change nationality" after I signed up.  If you use a US proxy to fool their IP address reader you might be able to skip this step, but you'll still need an ID.  And Skype numbers do work as they can now receive SMS texts.  Not sure but you may need a US physical address, but I just put my mother's.

Because you need to have bitcoin first, then open channels with the bitcoin of ample size, wait for confirmation before using lightning if you are to run your own LN node.
Use BlueWallet if all you want to do is have a few bucks (&lt;$300) on your phone and be able to use lightning.  There are other wallets like this coming if not already out.  I don't see any advantages to going full-node non-custodial on your cellphone.  But if custodial bothers you, you can always point it to your own LND node.

\&gt; "How secure is bitcoin from inflation attack?"
Seems like a sincere question so I'll try my best to answer it:
100% secure because if any kind of "hack" or soft-fork or hard-fork happened like this, 99.9% of the bitcoin holders (consensus) would not approve and revert back to The Bitcoin (defined by Satoshi as never having more than 21m coins).  If, say, somehow only 30% of bitcoin holders did not approve of the inflation, there would be a fork and the rest of the inflation-holding bitcoiners can go fuck themselves.

Figure out what it is that makes you uncomfortable about this step, and refine the process so that you can be as safe as possible.  Sounds like you are doing just fine using a trezor in the first place.  But I don't fully trust USB devices either - my USB drive for example fails all the time.
At some point your BTC could be worth a LOT more, and you'll need to accomodate that higher security too.  Us common folk are not used to dealing with a lot of money, so it's gonna involve learning new things and always growing.  I remember I considered selling during the bullrun of 2017 but didn't because I was basing my decision off of what was a lot of money for me, which was completely arbitrary.  It's like poker players - they are trained not to think about it.  I don't regret it because during the next bull run I'll shoot myself in the foot if, for example, I sell all my BTC when it hits $20k again, simply because that's what I considered a lot of money for me.  Just disregard that, and instead focus on the logical decision-making instead.

It is what it is:  the first lightning payment solution that you can immediately use without having to have bitcoin first (to open your own payment channels).  VERY big step forward.  A custodial solution is fine for your cellphone, but this goes a step beyond that and allows you to point it to your own node too if you want a non-custodial solution.
Anyway, I think BlueWallet is great.  But yeah, I don't plan to keep more than $100 bucks in there.  It's great for micropayments and onboarding with lightning.  I think this is the real reason people attack it, especially bcashers.

You seem like a competent, thorough person from your post.  But the people I've worked with in IT half the time don't belong there (are knuckle-draggers but are in software because it pays well).

But I do remember him predicting $2200 lows, now he's predicting $7000 lows.  I also know he's upset that he doesn't have the BTC he used to, and wants to buy back in and hasn't yet.  His predictions strike me as wishful thinking mistakes that market traders often make.  If I had to guess, just by him saying this tells me that buying pressure will probably not allow BTC to get to $7k again, just like it didn't with the $3k level back when everyone was looking at that to buy back in.

You can send and receive real lightning transactions with BlueWallet.  Nothing wrong with it.  If you think they are going to exit-scam everyone and take all your funds, just point it to your own node.  But then you'll have to open your own payment channels and maintain them.  It's an easy and ideal way for most people to get started with lightning.  And the only way if you don't have your own bitcoin.

Each of those other 20 cryptos have traded something technologically.  Usually efficiency or long term sustainability.  Or proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work.  (the world ought to have at least one good strong proof-of-work blockchain to anchor everything else into).  From a technical perspective, bitcoin is on the top and is improving.  Just a year ago we got segwit.  Now Schnorr signatures, new BIP proposals including the Eltoo Op.  No offence but sounds like you don't know what you are talking about.

I'm in my 40s, and noticed nearly everyone hiring is in their 20s.  Maybe that was a factor?  But I also noticed unprofessional behavior is rampant.  Sometimes the company would fold before I even heard back.  Sometimes it wouldn't, but I don't hear back anyway even after submitting "test assignments".
In the regular fintech/dev world, I never had a problem.  On avg 3 interviews is all it'd take for me to get hired onto a project.  I then bang the project out quickly, usually single-handedly, and out looking for work again.  :-(

I am far from sure about your conclusions.  Let tether fail/depreciate, there are several other better USD stablecoins out there, like TrueUSD and the new Gemeni coin.  Unless everyone is going to bail out of crypto because of tether, which I don't think so because if anything tether's weakness is the fiat banking system.

Martin Luther also posted his reformation letter on Oct 31st.  I've been arguing with my wife over whether splitting Christianity that first time was a good thing or a bad thing.  Now we have 500 different variants of Christianity, certainly the devil must be rejoicing.
According to the time traveler post, most people in the future (who have no bitcoin) will think that bitcoin was the devil's invention.  In his post, I can see how some people might think it's a bad thing, as it's too hard as money in many respects for people to have to earn.

From where I sit in Mexico, the BTCUSD drop from $6400 to $6200 corresponds almost exactly with the spike in the USDMXN from \~19 to \~20.

Another reason why custodial lightning wallets like BlueWallet would be the way to go for these people, as it would be hard to keep your own lightning node and channels up in that kind of environment.
Anyway I'd imagine a city like Caracas would have a few celular towers still running on generators.  If not, well maybe mesh networks are a bit too advanced for them to set up when they are starving?

These "walls" are usually caused by a bot which usually moves it around depending on prices on other exchanges.  If another exchange "pops" north pricewise by quite a bit/volume, the bot may remove that wall temporarily, but it usually reappears.  It is often accompanied by another corresponding buy-wall on the other exchange, or possibly the same exchange, thereby providing a certain level of liquidity as well.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:41:22
"network weakening" sounds like they think the floor is the price per unit to mine.  This seems like wrong, circular logic, as the price to mine depends greatly on how much resources the miner chooses to throw at it, which depends on price.  Maybe they think they will step in to prevent BTC from entering a "death spiral" but I thought that logic was debunked long ago.

First thing that happens is you get your funds frozen.  Next thing that  happens is you pay your taxes (regardless that the funds are still frozen).

In the meantime I suggest everyone reduce or eliminate all leverage in their positions, and when possible keep most of their bitcoin in their own possession and off exchanges.

Of these which one would you recommend?  I'm genuinely looking.
I don't like Bitmex because it generally costs too much in interest to take a position.  Also there are steep trading fees.
Of course in addition you are supporting an exchange with massive liquidity getting price feeds from exchange(s) with lesser liquidity.   Hence the scam and (more erratic than otherwise) price movements.   When I saw the action from the sidelines on May 16th, when the price whipped from $8k to $6k and then back up again in minutes, I realized that even 2x leverage was too much for just about everyone.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:47:34

Actually the more I think about it, this is key and the next hurdle to overcome.  Now that there's a lightning app that can both send AND receive, all we need is the ability for someone to open a channel from zero to be able to receive money for things to really take off.

If you know, buy some of that with your bitcoin.  But if you want to make a safe bet, just buy bitcoin.  I bought some LSK a while back because supposedly it was better than ETH technically.

The rules of civil forfeiture are:  the money is guilty until proven innocent.  This is civil law, so it's different.  Also, just because you CAN prove that it's innocent doesn't mean you get your money back.  There are procedures to follow, procedures that will cost north of the confiscation, and the beneficiaries of these procedures are the lawyers and govt bureaucracy itself, so lose-lose all the way.  The current fiat system is a joke, and only the stupid are still in it at this point.

Steer clear of Santander.  I used to have an account with them here in Mexico and they outright stole one of my incoming transfers.  I had the documentation to prove they did it so I went to the bank branch to stand in line for an hour.  They actually LAUGHED at me when I showed them the documents, then gave me a form to fill out with a large fee I had to pay for THEM to look into it.  I then went to the govt office here, I won the dispute because I had the documentation (from them), but they waited until the last minute to pay out the claim 90 days later.
Then, on a separate occasion, I used my American debit card at a Santander ATM.  I entered the amount I wanted (the most the ATM allowed), then it wanted a rather large fee so I declined the transaction.  It spit out my card and I left with no money.  I was surpised to say the least when I discovered they had taken the funds out of my account anyway!  I disputed it, but then the bank returned the dispute with a (forged?) document saying the ATM had dispensed the money (nearly $400 US), even though I declined the transaction because of their steep fees.
Santander is a criminal bank run by criminals.  DO NOT USE THEM.

Their only motivation I can think of would be to take down crypto, but if they tried it would be identified pretty quickly and algorithms can be changed out.
There's nothing to worry about.  This nocoiner is just talking himself out of taking appropriate action.   It's hilarious when people say the govt invented bitcoin (so don't use it, but stay on the obsolete system which the govt clearly invented and illicitly funds them?!).

What I'm saying is that the authorities can take what's in safe deposit boxes without even a good reason.  Even if the authorities of a country aren't corrupt, or even if they could not get all of the private key, several banks could+would sieze whatever's in your safety deposit boxes all at the same time across whatever country.

Ok, yeah I've seen this page before but obviously pretty complicated and a lot of variables to know.  I'd have to test &amp; retest before I'd have enough confidence to use this with any significant funds.  But thanks for explaining how to get started.
I'm not a big fan of mnemonics because there are no standard word lists, the word list that is somewhat standard I don't like because it is only 11 bits per word when it should be at least 12 or preferably 16.  11 bits is too odd.  Also, mnemonics is supposed to have each word translate into a base-2048 digit of a number, but some wallets don't do it this way:  they instead use each character as if it was the character to a long password.  So translating mnemonics depends heavily on your methodology, too many ways to screw it up without a standard.


Well if anyone stumbles upon them, your funds are theirs.  The idea is to encrypt a key with a password only you would know, even if it's weak, to help counter this.  I guess to each their own.
There ought to be a book on key management protocols, with a comprehensive look at all the different ideas and practices in use.  It could have a chapter on each thing, including maybe a chapter at the end for hiding place ideas, pros and cons of things, etc.

Have you ever tried to get someone else to open a safe deposit box for you?  (not that I have, but it must certainly be against bank policy if not outright illegal in these post-Patriot-Act days).  They give the key to you, but then banks have cameras pointed at you recording you walking in instead of the person who opened the account.

My fear is enough miners drop off, along with a price drop, that the block times go to 30-40 minutes or more, capacity backs up, and the problem gets worse and worse, people lose confidence, the price drops more, etc.  The so-called "death spiral".  And the blocks come on so slowly that we never get to the 2-week difficulty readjustment.  Not saying this is likely but is it possible?
My thought is that surely someone out there would pull us through to at least the next difficulty readjustment when block times can get back to 10 minutes again, but it could take months and by then everyone would lose a lot of confidence in the network.  Price could go down by several orders of magnitude during this time.  Of course then the network would be back to normal and we could all buy some cheap bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-02-08 18:39:09
He's suggesting that big players are buying up BTC in masse cheaply using OTC markets (buying volume at a set price), and then selling/dumping them on exchanges driving the price lower.  Then they can repeat the process and continue driving prices lower in everyone's mind, but the real value of BTC has been going up all this time because volumes and usage are exploding everywhere that we are not looking.
So one day (soon?) the OTC volume will dry up and prices could explode.

There are several things in the Bitmex TOS that don't sit well with me.  This being one of them, but another being that they can freeze &amp; take your money if they discover you are a US citizen/person.  Also, they can change their TOS at any time.
I'm also not comfortable holding positions on Bitmex because I noticed that, although my positions were making money for while, when hourly interest rates goes to zero they are not exactly zero, they are 0.01% or something like that.  I bet this is their cut, and that seems pretty steep, especially if you are using leverage.  And almost any leverage in bitcoin will be fatal as we've seen in recent market moves.
I agree with the OP.  I think anyone with some sense should avoid Bitmex.  But are there any better services out there for trading crypto and in particular BTC with leverage?

The US economy (and world economy) is like a big casino with another set of books in the back that you are not seeing.  So it's difficult to know anything.  I would have expected the economy to have collapsed a long time ago had there not been some unseen support from somewhere.  So don't rush to conclusions.  This 'casino' is very profitable and they'll keep it running as long as they can.
Bitcoin represents an exit door (there are only a few doors).  Cash out your fiat tokens for real money and leave the premises.  That said, you must still participate in the world economy but it will also slowly leave the building.

I always see reasons to be skeptical, but let's face it:  people were acting like they knew what they were talking about.  That it would take out the whole bitcoin market, etc.   That Bitfinex could not be trusted (even though they had made good during crisises before).   There were no end to the stories, remember that?
I had funds on Bitfinex and was concerned, but not enough to close my positions and take a hike.  The people who did likely missed out on gains.  I don't see anyone calling anyone out for having spread misinfo.

You can run your own LND node and point BlueWallet to use that instead of their node.  Either way it does not really make sense to run a full lightning node on your phone.

I hate to break it to you kids here but this wasn't all that visionary.  It was obvious in the late 1990s, it was on a "wishlist of the internet" for just about everyone to have internet cash, except that no one knew exactly how to implement it.  The best we had was paypal, and it was hip to use it to pay your friends.  Then the early to mid 2000s was the age of digital gold currencies (of which the govt shut them all down relentlessly).  Out of that I believe was born the next evolution: P2P which could not be shut down.  But a key concept was also no gold or other centralized backing, just the finite supply.  Yet it could still work.  I didn't hear anything about that concept from anyone including Friedman.   So this is no big deal, ya'll.

Yes.  Seeing how the fed treated Liberty Dollar, e-gold, and other digital currencies that were actually backed (siezable), you wonder why they are treating bitcoin so kindly.
It's because they have no way of doing anything about it, that's why.  So they just ignore and downtalk it, while otherwise not attacking it.
If they knew where Tether's accounts were, I strongly suspect one day they would freeze them ALL and make up some charges.  This is one reason Tether cites that it cannot provide a thorough audit.  I suspect this is what really happened with the $850m, and then the subsequent attention to it.  But since it did not take down Tether or Bitfinex, now the $850m will ultimately be unfrozen and "my bad" from the system (no apology though).

They'll probably try to control the pricing with options, not shorts.  Either way they'd need to cover and the only way for them to do that is either control miners or go to the market.

I don't see how it can be done correctly.
If you encrypt your keys in the cloud, you are still holding the key to decrypt it on your phone/computer so why bother, just hold the key to your coins instead.
If Coinbase or someone else also has this key, so you don't have to be 100% entirely responsible for it, they might as well have access to your coins.  This might actually be their plan as I suspect their strategy is to have control over as many coins as possible.  We already know they love doing whatever big govt tells them to.

WW3 will probably not be nuclear.  It will involve certain countries but not most countries, though most countries will have their 'side'.  Bitcoin will be fine.  Not sure how it'll do but stands to reason it'll do quite well as no other stores of wealth will be reliable.  However the wealth it may represent might be being destroyed so I don't know.  Should be better than gold though in this scenario.

You obviously have very little experience with the banking world, especially in foreign countries.
Tether is a necessary evil because it is a bridge from the old corrupt fiat world to the new machine-driven uncorruptable crypto economy.  What we are seeing is the banking system launching a coordinated attack against crypto, and the crypto surviving.  (banking system siezes assets with bogus taint claim, banking system regulators then announce and attack them for therefore not having the backing causing a panic, XRP selling huge amounts of crypto during all of this).
It's just my opinion: I think Bitfinex is doing a great job, and they do not strike me as the kind of people who are exit-scammers.

Buying on Gemini is instant, but then you have to wait for 5+ days for the bank ACH to clear before you can withdraw the bitcoin, plus they charge 1%.

Sounds like you are very well studied.  In the establishment's version of history.
Central banks and "consumer-facing depositor banks" are part of the same fractional reserve system.  The central bank sets the fractional reserve rate.  And actually the bank turns around and sells their consumer loans to the central bank in exchange for currency.
I think that you're distracting from the main point here.  I'm not going to use fiat as money when someone out there has the "keys to the backdoor" to print as much of it as they want.  For whatever reason.  Legitimate or not.  But you can go on being an apologist and keep using their fiat.  And if you want to avoid inflation you can put it in a real store of value, then pay taxes on your "gains" all just for trying to preserve your wealth.  It's bogus.

All other crypto coins have been disappointing.  I think Ethereum is very practical but now with them rebuilding it I feel it's more of a think-tank.  The future world reserve currency is either going to be bitcoin or some other unknown refined next-gen crypto that govts get behind (and therefore I wouldn't fully trust).  I am confident though that the future world reserve currency will ultimately be crypto.

Probably by 2140, bitcoin will either be a niche thing like it is today, or the world currency and people won't be able to imagine when we used to trust paper/fiat.  By then we'll have an idea what stable usage looks like, probably as a backend to lightning or something better, and the block size will be adjusted to what normal usage will be.  Mining will have probably stabilized as well, as will its difficulty.

The problem is, in every other market someone out there has the 'keys to the backdoor', even gold.  With gold there must be a hidden supply/mine and of course delivery policies (no silver delivered to investment entities, for example), then it's simple to rig the market.  But even a stock has people who can dilute shares, or buy them back, all while you are the one being screwed.  Real estate is of course a joke, but not only that the property taxes and rate are outside of the owner's control.  There literally is no market I cannot think of where you control your money except crypto.  And bitcoin is king.
Cash fiat is of course constantly diluting, however theoretically you can put your money into a bank/bond where it pays at least the inflation rate.  The problem with this is your funds are never in your possession and can be frozen/confiscated at will by the powerz that be, who of course are abusing this power more and more these days.
I am confident the world will eventually catch up and see things our way.

There was a MtGox flash-crash but that's because at the time it was the only exchange in the world, and it was hacked.  They had to fix it and roll it back.  In the end the BTC didn't actually end up changing hands at those prices.

No, No, and No.  I picked the right person in every metric.  Computer guy, while prices were under $400.  It was for a wedding gift.  I can just see the new wife going through the box and asking him "WTF is this?!" and throwing the paper wallet away.  In my case I had the foresight to make a copy of the wallet when I gave it to him.  When prices were approaching $20k and I saw that the coin  still hadn't moved, I took the coin back!  Now I don't talk to him.  If he ever asks I'll have to just say "oh well I have no idea" and maybe give him a consolation amount comparable to a good wedding gift.
I can give other examples as well, but you get the idea.  DON'T GIVE AWAY BITCOIN.  Maybe you can make it easier for them to buy bitcoin but that's about it.  They have to correlate in their brains that bitcoin is scarce.  Much scarcer than what they are used to as money.

Oh ok.  My apologies then.

The loan borrower is paying a much higher interest rate, which is calculated from inflation estimates, so this isn't true or else bankers wouldn't be loaning.  WAY better for them than deflation where people are generally defaulting on their debts, which is what causes deflation in our current debt-based system.  This is why bankers hate deflation.


The $10B guy usually owns a business where their prices change in accordance to inflation, so he is almost completely insulated.  While the min wage guy is constantly living on less and less until he gets his next raise which generally doesn't keep up with inflation either.

Right.  And the inflection point that is coming will be caused by the beginnings of adoption of L2 solutions like lightning.  This will happen once it becomes possible to receive payments in lightning without first having had bitcoin or opening a channel yourself.

I remember when I got into bitcoin.  It was when I saw the move below $200 and felt it was time I finally got in.  I remember seeing it at $186 and tried to buy.Unfortunately, I couldn't because it took me a few days to set up my accounts and I didn't finally buy some until $220ish.
I think we have to look at the price and ask yourself what would "feel" like a good price to you?  $3k-ish is my gut feeling but we have to remember there are some big boys looking at this and seeing lightning coming in 2019.  Little guys like us might not get our chance to buy.

Man... maybe you're right.
We need to figure out how to inflate bitcoin or else it might ruin the world.  Maybe we should abandon bitcoin and let the central bankers make their Fedcoin with 2% inflation (or whatever they deem appropriate) so we can have what we have today only with 100% transparency for everyone except bankers and govt.  Otherwise the economy might completely change!
No doubt a currency that doesn't constantly lose value means no jobs or meaningful economy.

A stock is only worth what it will ultimately pay you in dividends.  Anything else you've been sold a story.  Period.
Look at what dividends are today.  Not to mention since most Americans are double-taxed on dividends, it's a very inefficient wealth store mechanism.  It's only "conventional wisdom" (the masses about to lose their shirts again) that gives them their valuations today.  That and the "fed put" (PPT).

You can just install the eclair wallet on your android phone, transfer some bitcoin to it, and open a channel to another lightning node.  At which point you will be able to spend on the lightning network.  I know, a lot of steps, but Joe Bitcoin can do it.

Anyway the ability for multiple users to share lightning nodes and channels securely is down-the-line.  Which will be nice because not everyone wants the bother running a node (99.999% uptime) and balancing channels, etc.  I run a lightning node (CL) and it takes some effort.

I think the Fed has every intention of running up debt as high as they can so they can ultimately default.  This will not be good for FRN holders, nor US stocks/bond holders.

Based on my limited understanding, a simpler counter-argument to this may be:
How is a bot (or anyone) going to open new channels and have the network trust it enough for funds to ultimately concentrate in those nodes?  They won't.  Central nodes in lightning will tend around the nodes with the most funds in them already, most connections, most uptime, and service to the network.  This attack can't work unless your nodes manage to end up being central somehow.  So fly-by-night bots won't cut it.

It's the same tactics credit cards use by allowing you to go over your limit (often with you not knowing where the limit even is), and then charging you an "over limit fee".
However, this is a more sophisticated way to steal your money, by invoking KYC policies that customers should not even have to know about.
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:13:32
The only thing you could do is rip off exchanges and anyone unaware an attack was happening during the time you were attacking it.   You'd need more than 1 hour as well.  Bitcoin itself would survive because eventually the chain would revert.  But a lot of people you stole from might be pissed off because they gave you whatever at only 3 or whatever confirmations.

You can resell stuff on eBay or even amazon.  Spend some time researching it, there are plenty of youtube videos on how to do it.  Get started this week setting up.  Next week have a go.  You can get better at it as time goes on.  I know people who make side-money doing this and it works.

I believe it is true, but with bitcoin we can more easily take delivery and this is problematic for 'the cartel' (whose goal is to preserve the Federal Reserve Note as money above all else, including superior forms of money like gold/silver).  The difference is, they can buy up a gold/silver mine somewhere and pay the miners in fiat and use the supply to suppress the market.  However, importantly, they also use intimidation of delivery (and in many cases flat-out don't deliver on silver/gold contracts, depending on the source of the demand (for example, if it's deemed 'investment' instead of industrial)).  Also, say you take delivery on your 10,000 oz of silver, where are you gonna keep it that's not outside the reach of your govt?  NOWHERE.
So enter Bitcoin.  If the 'cartel' is truly trying to suppress the price, they will get their hands caught in the cookie jar fairly early on, you can bet on that!  Their credibility in the crypto-space will crumble quickly, unlike the fact that JPM's credibility still exists even after their silver fiasco.

$1M in USD terms.  That's capacity.
I run a lightning node and I just upped the capacity on some of my channels bigtime recently.

I guess everyone else has been thinking like me too.  Bigtime bullish IMO.

\&gt; By the way, it could be a good possible exit for Bitmain (for example) to quietly produce the necessary rig for them.
Very good point.  If this is the case, we should be able to spy on them and see signs of them putting something together.  Also, a lot of the other independent miners are going out of business left and right.  Maybe they have a new ASIC chip coming out in masse soon that they can use?
\&gt; So they can present a bigger block chain A LOT LATER than many think. For example, the “fake” block chain length can be 4500 blocks (it just takes a month ).  The damage will be colossal.
Perhaps, but consensus will be that it was an attack and they can fork.  Damage would be there because of the reality of the 51% attack weakness but everyone would still have their funds on the forked chain.  Maybe a new mechanism could be introduced in its future.

You should diversify out, and deleverage.  Probably leave most in crypto.  This guy was being greedy and actually *increasing* his leverage.  It's a painful lesson to have to learn the hard way.

The L2 strategies I had in mind when I wrote this were lightning, mimble-wimble, and tumble-bit, but there are probably others too.
By key management I mean that you can keep your identity separate from your addresses, and also manage the keys you use so that people can't know how much bitcoin you have.  Not sure that'll keep btc from being flagged by chainalysis but there are also tumblers so it's not like refusing coin because of a taint is practical, anymore so than refusing USD cash because 90% of it is tainted with trace amounts of cocaine.
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:08:21


BCH blocks were full and they had to fork SV.  We can disregard why there's a blocksized limit in the first place because this is Satoshi we are talking about.
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:58:44
Well think ahead a bit.  You are paying (taxes) to be able to use *their* money, which they dilute regularly without you knowing how much they are diluting, or causing credit crunches in which case they buy all your stocks or real estate back from you for cheap because you need suddenly scarce money to live, and if you transgress against them you can have your assets taken/frozen.  Do you think that's fair?
Once you go bitcoin you don't have to worry about any of these things, and I for one am a lot better off since I did so.

I have fees set low unlike some people.  At 1 satoshi per transaction it's gonna take a lonnngggg time before I ever make any money.  Routing is not always smart enough at the moment to always choose the most optimal path.  Occasionally I notice payments I make that go through several hops and the fees end up being 200+ satoshis.  Still nothing but bothers me a bit.  Fatter channels are important because if you look at the network how it was a couple months back, channels were like $1.63 or something ridiculously small and no one could route payments.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:10:01
Once that channel is open from the exchange to you, I believe you can then spend or receive using that lightning channel from that point on, and you won't need to ever settle/close the channel if you don't feel like it.
Opening a lightning channel is a bit like getting a new credit card, only you can spend AND receive funds with it, all with zero fees.  Closing the channel is then like closing the credit card and zeroing it out.  You don't really need to do it, but from time to time you probably will.

Heh, let's just say I'm old enough to remember, and I remember the govt shutting down all the digital gold currencies (DGCs) in the 2000s, and the ones they couldn't shut down because of their superior governance they just shut down all onramps and offramps.  I had given up in digital/online currencies at that point, and stopped following them.  Which is one of the reasons I missed the beginning days of bitcoin.
The difference is of course there's nothing to shut down.  They can try to shut down onramps/offramps but we also have localbitcoins and exchanges in many other countries now.  And really it no longer needs fiat ramps to have value.  I can just pay for hookers and blow with crypto now, for one thing.

Mathematically, the market will move up eventually.
However, if we are seeing price suppression tactics by the new futures market mechanisms, we may continue to see a slow decline until some large company helping them, like Coinbase, fails to deliver.  Then we will know that the market has been mispriced and then all hell will break loose to the upside.
Eventually, the market will move up.

Congrats to OP for making this realization and taking the first steps towards self improvement.  I actually know someone in your position who is also working in a warehouse and fed up.  He gets paid even less than you I'm sure so don't be too ungrateful.  At least you have something.
My advice:  If you can make ends meet and have a little left over to save in bitcoin, do so, and keep your job for now.  But start hustling.  If you're working &gt;50 hours per week and don't have time to hustle for a new and better job that you'd rather be doing, it may be worth it to take a chance and quit, but be 100% serious.  I'm lucky to have reached this point in my life early and it took only 3 days for me to find something much better and send me on my career path.  But if you are already in your 30s or older like the guy I know, it's much harder.  But still, get serious and do it!

But if you'd rather sit on USD instead of bitcoin for fear of tether affecting it, be my guest.  Or maybe you know of a better investment?


I've seen the specifics of this argument before but I'm not convinced.  Tether is 1.5% of bitcoin's marketcap, and I don't believe even a worse-case scenario will throw the market that much.  Maybe you can link to the FUD article that has you convinced.  Plus I don't think there will be a worse-case scenario because bitFinex will back it up, and I do believe that tether has plenty of USD in various accounts.

Wrong.  It's definitely time to hodl.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:49:45
Actually this doesn't prove anything.  You can know and understand the method, and there could still be backdoors in it.  However, SHA256 has three "nothing up my sleeve" numbers in the algorithm that makes it highly unlikely there's a backdoor.  Plus it's been out for a long time and peer-reviewed by cryptographers.
Even so, should a backdoor or weakness ever be found, bitcoin has some time before it needs to change its PoW consensus algorithm to a new hashing method, since the current method is actually SHA256 done twice.  But hashing algorithms can be changed out should it become necessary.
Bottom line is, I wouldn't worry.
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:09:38
Why can't bitcoin hodlers start a class-action lawsuit against these people for financial damages?  Bitcoin.com (Roger Ver) can be sued.  Craig Wright can/should be sued.  Jihan can probably have a judgement issued against him in the West.  What they are doing is against civil codes and can even be deemed as fraudulent.
Usually foreign govts respect extradition for cases of fraud.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:22:59
"I thought I was buying bitcoin, but instead I was buying bcash due to Ver's deceptive website and organization".  It could be a whole class action lawsuit.  The thing is, it wouldn't be frivolous in the slightest.

A lot of the Mexican well-to-do voted for Anaya and are feeling down right now, trying to flee the peso.  I know one of them who decided to buy dollars (not bitcoin or gold).  The USDMXN doesn't seem to know which way to go right now.
In the long run though, AMLO will be good for Mexico just like he was good for CDMX.  Just the spending cuts alone (the fat) will help out a lot.  Still, the MXN peso isn't a place to keep your money.
Also, I'm noticing on Bitso the price in pesos is not keeping up with the price everywhere else.  So Mexicans are not fleeing the peso to BTC, at least not at the moment.  Price action is lagging other exchanges.

@_date: 2018-07-07 04:59:57
In ten years hard drives will be cheaper, but I don't think we'll all have 10x the internet speed to download multi-terabyte blockchains everytime you want to start a new node.  Plus the bigger issue is block propagation on the network to a distributed mining network so that the block can be verified before another block is found.  Happens occasionally but with larger blocks it'd happen way too frequently.
I don't agree that Satoshi would want to have raised the blocksize so quickly because first you would want to make it as efficient as possible before trying to scale it up.  And blocksize alone would never be able to scale it up to we'd want anyway.
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:18:07

Well, this is not currently correct, but I'll give it to you.  The other "outperforming" coins have other trade-offs.  Bitcoin is pretty darn good for a store-of-value coin.  As for what you buy it with, depends on the market &amp; exchange.  You can buy bitcoin with gold and vice-versa.  I don't think that point, or the mining cost point, is relevant actually.
Bitcoin is valuable because it can be used as money.  Like gold was back in the day.

Well they screwed up the difficulty algorithm but otherwise yeah I guess it is a bitcoin rip-off.  Except they don't have segwit or any of the recent improvements or fixes because they don't have their own devs.  But mostly it's about trying to copy the name and fool others into believing BCH is Bitcoin.  Blocksize is actually not that signficant since none of the blocks are full or even close to it.

I remembered he also wanted to *reduce* the blocksize (temporarily).  In hindsight he may have had a point as block fees are only 1sat/byte and have been for a while.  But I still think it was a ridiculously unnecessary idea to have been pitching seriously.

@_date: 2018-07-29 21:08:56
I disagree with this analysis.  I think it's somewhat likely that bitcoin could go back to the $4800-$6000 area again before the next bull streak.  I also think that the next bull streak will be driven by lightning and will be one you will not want to miss or sell too early!
Also the gold chart as an example of what bitcoin 'could' do is not relevant and ridiculous.  Could put up some corn futures chart on any timeframe and make the same arguments.

Let's think about the $10 scenario.  For that scenario to play out, someone will have had to come up with a better form of money or technology that makes bitcoin obsolete.  Even Ethereum was not up to this task.  So what are the chances of this happening?

Actually though, now that I think about it, there are less "I got hacked" posts/stories than there used to be too.  I think cryptos are actually driving computer security more than ever.

The whole point of bitcoin is so that men can be men again and have control over their own money. 
Currently, this is not the case.  Everyone *but* you has control over your money, the govt, your wife, anyone who decides to wage a frivolous lawsuit against you, etc.  Men need to unlearn this aspect of our current system and take charge again.  Bitcoin is the only thing that allows this to happen, and you are ignoring this key feature.

Can't have instant or micro transactions on bitcoin without L2 no matter what the blocksize is.  I think having a multi-terabyte blockchain size on a shitcoin will be a problem for it one day.


I think I've heard you say this before in another post.  It is ridiculous to think Satoshi would NOT want LN.  It is an application on top of bitcoin which is independent, so what would even the drawback be?

Good luck!  Sounds like you've got a good chance if you can just find this chap.  You can maybe try to find and look up associated addresses, look up who was doing rainbow brainwallet scans back then (I remember back then was the big brainwallet scare and these rainbow attacks were making news.  I suspect this guy might have just been part of that campaign in warning people.  He might have been doing you a favor to try to protect your money for you in the meantime).  Or you can just look up who sent you the msgs.
If/when you get the coins back, I would suggest not telling your wife (or anyone else).  Keep what you have private and it'll be yours.  But you need to break your gambling habit too.  Ask yourself this:  if you had a checking account and savings account, but it cost a 1% fee to move the money from one to the other, would you just sit there all day and move the money back and forth?  This is essentially what gamblers do (a 1% house fee is conservative), only the money that appears is randomly sometimes more, sometimes less than what you had moved.  The game is usually a bit more complex than that to keep you from seeing the simple truth of what you are doing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:19:56
They are not better.  For every design consideration there is usually something lost elsewhere (for example bigger blocks).  Ethereum has faster blocktimes and does a lot more, but running a node is very resource-intensive.  Also, none of these chains have the kind of traffic the bitcoin blockchain already has.
"There are other cryptos that are simply better currencies than BTC right now" - This point is always so easily accepted and I don't think it's true.
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:11:25
I think there may be a case for a block size increase, but L2 brings so much to the table I'm sure that Satoshi wouldn't oppose.  It is my opinion we should wait and see how L2 solutions mature and then decide what the block size should be.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:52:25
That's right.
Unless you trust our govt won't take your 401k one day.  Or the dollar won't hyperinflate.  Or an economic crisis won't take away your 401k gains.  Or any number of things.  On the other hand, there's bitcoin, a mathematical worldwide immutable ledger.

It's not just me.  There's been a lot of technical analysis suggesting that bitcoin will bottom on or around March 31st.  This could very well mean the next bull run begins April 1st (Easter).  The much talked about 'death cross' (200 day MA crossing the 50 day MA) is happening about now, but I believe it is more indicative of a bottom than of a bear market.  The fundamentals are too strong.  So if you are stressing out, don't, because this is a sign from God!

A much needed break.  Today I went to sell a gold coin (hell no I'm not selling bitcoin at these levels) but the shop I usually go to didn't have cash nor their act together.  A girl I was supposed to meet also cancelled.  Then I tried to make a lightning payment and that also failed (to bitrefill, but no route could be found).  The world failed me today.
But for some reason I feel relieved.  I'm now having a beer and relaxing.  Everything will be okay tomorrow.  I have a feeling the lightning problem was because the channels exhausted too quickly and there was no route the funds could take.  People are opening their lightning nodes with only US$8 bucks and sh*t.  WTF?

The TA guys I've been watching were looking at head-and-shoulders patterns and made no mention of the fact that BTCUSD was about to break it's downtrend line (the downtrend line drawn from the peaks on a log chart).

I don't think it's entirely a dumb strategy.
I'm riding a small balance on my credit card because I know BTC will give me a better return than even the relatively high interest rate the credit card charges me.  And it has been.
Just consider the possibility that BTC dips again.  Or you lose your job and ruin your credit because you can't pay it back.  Or have to sell your BTC at a loss.  The $200/month option is a more comfortable option.  Though you might regret not buying in all at once at $8k in a year.
My 2 satoshis:  calculate how you will feel under the various scenarios and mitigate accordingly.  Do not necessarily base it on the money or price calculations (but consider them as well).  Sounds counter-intuitive investment advice, but believe it or not this really works, at least for me.

I don't.  Paying taxes is very patriotic and necessary.  I love paying taxes.  I just feel that taxes should be like 1/100th of what they are and we should be getting better service.
Bitcoin is the only investment vehicle I can think of that no one has the keys to the backdoor to be able to print as many as they want in.  Whales can temporarily manipulate, sure.  But at some point as the rest of the world begins more and more to realize bitcoin is the way to go, even whales will not be able to manipulate it.  It's pure mathematical money.

Gold functions because it's supposed to be scarce, but not knowing exactly how much gold is out there is a problem though making it a less than perfect currency.  A surplus somewhere is allowing the price to be manipulated downwards.  Also, being physical means that the govt of the jurisdiction you are in can get at it anytime it wants, usually legally.
I'm sure there are other intellectual reasons why bitcoin is better than gold, like the ability to finally have financial privacy, but this is just a few of them.

Much more valuable advice:  avoid dating, at least for a good long time.
Save save save, and consider buying some silver, it's still low.  The gold/silver ratio is sky-high so buy silver over gold.  Buy some BTC too but dollar-cost average.  Buy enough to make you not so salty if it goes straight up from here, but it most likely won't.

My thoughts are that I noticed a lot of FUD (Buffet, Tether, Bitfinex, etc.) hit right before the run.  Short squeezing and covering, FOMO, and "look the bear market is over" took over.

If it were not for the Federal Reserve and their QE (printing), bitcoin would not be at these prices either.   So the question is, what are people buying the bitcoin with?

When I looked at the S&amp;P500 today, it honestly scared me.  This is the beginning of something.
That said, however, I believe that even the central banks are powerless and must QE to infinity.  They cannot politically allow the markets to crash too hard.  Their heads will be on a stick if they do not QE.  People saying they will intentionally let the market crash are full of crap.  They would not be able to get away with it this time like they did in 1929.  So they MUST QE, even if it means fiat goes to zero.
I'd expect the S&amp;P500 to go down to the 200MA and then the PPT steps in and the fed buys the put there, halting the market slide.

You are trusting the issuer in any case to back said currency.  In this world that's becoming increasingly difficult.  Even if you can trust the US govt for now, a look inside doesn't yield a lot of confidence going forward.
Let's not beat around the bush.  Bitcoin is valuable because it is truly scarce, and useful as money in ways we've never had before.  It's a closer implementation to what we imagine as money than anything before it.

I don't understand why you think this is so important.  Clearly segwit adoption is happening, the ups and downs are just noise depending on how many of the txns going through at any moment are adopters vs non-adopters.  Many people are still gonna use the same address generators they've always used because it costs time and trust to look for a different (segwit) address generator.

I know irreversible payments scare the hell out of a lot of people, but in many ways it's a gift.  If you want to be able to reverse payments you need to either 1) pay money to someone you trust (who will return the money if you are not satisfied) or 2) use an escrow function/service.

I agree with everything else you said, but if anyone bothers to look at the graph, segwit adoption is on a clear uptrend.

Well, it's back up now so not only were you wrong with your deceptive spirit, you are also technically wrong as well.

The answer to the question is the same reason most people are still running pre 0.17 versions of bitcoin.  It just takes a while for people to upgrade when they don't have to.  Segwit was a malleability fix so sure, I'm pro-Segwit.  It also enables lightning, which is awesome, so sure.  50% adoption in just over 1 year (15 months) isn't too shabby, particularly when it's not a forced upgrade.  I don't know why you are being alarmist about it unless you are just another bcash shill.

Don't let the assholes get you down, I appreciate what you are saying.
As a new investor in my 20s, I've lost everything before.  It's not the end of the world, just like starting a business is a risk where chances are 9/10 it will go to zero.  Guess what?  no risk no gain.  But mostly those kinds of market losses came from being greedy.
Bitcoin is a savings vehicle that no one has a backdoor key to.  It is one you can put faith and discipline in.  No other vehicle I can think of comes close except for maybe gold.  I am 100% confident it is a good investment.  I have no idea how long or how deep the bear market will be but either way use discipline and you will be fine.
Like what you said, for most people most of their money goes to zero anyway.  From household expenses to car depreciation.  Almost no one has anything to show for their paycheck a year or so later.  Bitcoin is the one thing you can be mathematically sure of \*won't\* go to zero!  So why do they get so fearful?  you are right they shouldn't be!
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:43:17
As far as I know, currently, channel capacity will always be limited to what you opened it with, which is why I had to close out my old ones, move more bitcoin over, and reopen nice large new channels.  That's 3 onchain txns just to add capacity.  If/when I deplete this channel I can add funds back to the channel via lightning, but then balancing becomes an issue.  You cannot currently receive funds if you do not have space for those funds via having spent those funds or an otherwise empty channel.
In my mind these are the biggest limitations lightning must overcome.  Eltoo and channel factories will help, just not sure to what extent since we don't have them yet.

I'm in Mexico and I've had occasional problems (two in 10 years).  Basically bank mistakes are usually in their favor.  I was shocked when I went to the bank to dispute the matter and aside from having to wait in line for nearly an hour, I was not helped at all.  I was given a form to file (complaint) with the bank and to add insult to injury they charged a $20 fee (in dollars, oddly) to file the complaint.
I then learned there's a govt office (CONDUSEF) that is for disputing matters with banks.  It doesn't cost anything, just a little time and trouble to go down to their office, and the money was returned to my account exactly 3 months later on the last day of the time period after which the matter would have been escelated.
I also had a problem with that same bank (Santander) where I went to one of their ATMs to take money out of my American account.  The fees they wanted to charge were ridiculous, so I declined and canceled the transaction.  The funds were taken out of my account anyway (!).  I disputed the charge with the American credit union, and they were quite helpful, trusted me and reversed the charge same-day.  They have a mechanism for following up with foreign/Mexican banks, possibly connected with that same office.
All in all the banking system in Mexico isn't bad.  One thing I like about them is they have a domestic money transfers that are instant and usually free.  It means I can sell bitcoin, transfer to my account, and take cash out of the ATM all in less than 5 minutes!  They have KYC, but don't take it to extremes like in the U.S.
But if you are an American you will need to re-learn how banking works outside the U.S.  I'm sure in this case the Americans will get their money back inside a few months.  Could be that someone inside the bank defrauded them, because it was targetting Americans it might have to do with special rules banks have for Americans (another can of worms).

So long as a significant chunk of the population still support Maduro, a coup backed by the USA won't be successful.  I heard that Maduro was about to step down until Putin told him not to.  Also Trump backed off his support of the opposition right after his meeting with Putin.  Putin needs him for something and the only thing it could be is oil.

If by "cashing out" you mean buying Federal Reserve Notes with your bitcoin (real money), and paying the tax event for the privilege of doing so, and then have the opportunity to be frozen by the crypto-unfriendly bank, doesn't seem like a good idea.
The only reason to do so is to be able to use it, in a country where people work to pay their debt, but have way too much debt.

I've personally given up on trying to predict this, and would rather just remove myself from their system altogether.  BTC floats when they QE, and sinks when they tighten.

The term "consensus" threw me in blockchain projects, because it can refer to two different things.  1) What we think it means is like when everybody or nearly everybody agrees that something needs to be done.   but in blockchain design circles it means 2) the mechanism in which a new block is decided to be good and then added onto the blockchain.
