How!?! Average 8-12 gigs on my phone a month.  I just used 5 this week and I don't download anything or use hotspots.

When bitcoins where two dollars a piece I lost 45 of them on one dice roll when gambling...
I didn't want to go through the trouble of cashing out and there was nothing to buy with them...
I hate myself

This may be a stupid question, but what would I use to open the wallet?  Blockchain accounts need identifiers...

Alot of people who get tips that are to small to spend will just let it sit in their wallet.  Eventually some will be forgotten, and then they'll sit in limbo forever :/

WE ARE OUT OF OUR MINDS FOR GETTING INVOLVED WITH THIS

I love how the tipping increased after the Dogecar became a reality.  Say what you want but dogecoin is definitely inspiring some bitcoiners
