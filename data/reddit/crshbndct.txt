The "valid point" I agree to is the fact that the countries in which bitcoin really solves extant problems are also the ones that don't have the telecommunications infrastructure to support bitcoin fully.
I am saying nothing about libertarian ideals here, since I actually love my country, and think my government is doing a fine job of managing the economy here.

They are learning from it. That is the problem. And that is why you cannot expect someone who is trying out bitcoin for the first time to know about those things.
As far as Mt. Gox is concerned, they were still recommended as the exchange to use until very recently on many "How to Bitcoin" sites/guides.

So what you are saying is that for the majority of sites that switch without posting about it to a forum filled with people who are actively trying to make Bitcoin look good, you would have brought in $11.95?

Oh yeah, I agree with that. Especially this part:


I just get sick of people making excuses for when something comes out(in this example a new game studio releases a game) and people blindly defend it saying things like "Its a new studio give them time.. It took $STUDIO 5 years to get good"
Maybe a bit of a flawed example, but in my opinion the technical issues faced by bitcoin at the moment are things that need to be fixed, and soon, so that the rest of the ecosystem thing can improve.

Allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment.
For all intensive purposes I think you are ALL wrong.
In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.
Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.

@_date: 2014-12-13 21:26:55
Yeah their system is wholly non profit, and run by the government.
Rates are also set and controlled by the government, and payout percentage is over 90%. 
So its more of a transparent use of tax than anything else. I don't think that one country that has a strictly regulated private healthcare system proves the point that all healthcare should be completely privatized though. 
I had a conversation on reddit with someone who lost a brother to suicide recently after being bankrupted and losing their house because of medical bills. When I asked what the issue was, they told me it was the same thing I experienced at the start of the year, except I just had surgery and was back at work a few weeks later, with my financial situation unchanged. 
My point is that education, healthcare and infrastructure are things that are essential for a population to thrive, and if these things are allowed to become a for profit business, then the long term effect is negative for a country. Unless you really believe that big business has the best interests of people at heart.

Well here's the thing. 
Outside of America's 19th century banking system which has not evolved or changed at all with technology (based on descriptions of it I have read online), modern banks do everything bitcoin does, but they do it several times faster and easier and more securely, with less damage to the environment, and they do it much, much cheaper.
So the people who want bitcoin to work, must necessarily be one of those anti government people, since bitcoin sucks donkey dick as money, and only really has utility as a means to end government or whatever the hell people think it does besides being money.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:58:32
Accepting people's money, with the full knowledge that you are not able to give them what they paid for, is fraud. Plain and simple.

Because the algorithm always, *always* favors memes and image macros. No matter how many people try to downvote to keep the sub in decent shape, ALL subs without meme-moderation rules *will* turn into an like shithole when the sub reaches critical mass.
It is just how reddit works.

@_date: 2013-12-19 12:42:36
Fair call. 
I do regularly transfer money around the world instantly with no fees without the need for bitcoin so maybe I was overlooking this.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:13:23
To give you an example. 
Say you completely ignored the current BTC/US$ price, except for the strict purpose of affixing a price in BTC to something.
You sell your (freehold) house in a nice area for 2000 BTC when the price is $260, because your house was worth roughly $500K, the kids have left home and you want to downsize and take maybe 50 of those BTC for a holiday.
A week later you have $95k worth of BTC in your wallet, and you are looking to buy a house in a slum, and asking for loans from the bank just to get a roof over your head, and your retirement hase been put off by 5 years.
Sure cars and technology devalue, but having them devalue because they currency they are bought and sold in is different to them devaluing because they are getting old.
I am no market expert, so I may be oversimplifying this, and if I am please someone correct me. But that is, as far as I can see, the danger of a currency being as volatile as this. It needs to stabilise and change by 1-2% a day, not 20-60%
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:40:59


Absolutely nailed it. It does matter to some degree how high or low it is though, with only 21million BTC available, if it were $5 or something, the whole market would be worth the same as a really fancy private jet. But you are right. For the long term survival of Bitcoin, Stability &gt; Speculation and quick bucks.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:14:03
But doesn't using one of those services basically just make bitcoin end up functioning like paypal or something? They basically exist to try to stem the volatility of bitcoin, which is an admission that it *is* too volatile to be used as a currency right now.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:21:27
Yes, but it has been established as a currency long before that. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:16:24
The problem with the "leave it to the votes" argument is that the reddit voting algorithm favors memes and low effort posts a LOT more than anything else.
Which means that even if 6/10 people dislike a post, it will still float to the top and drown out other, more informative posts.
It is just the way it is. Either you have heavy moderation (such as in or to a lesser extent in r/games) or this place will end up looking like before the drama a few months ago, which was just page after page of shitposting and karma mining.

Fair point.
Credit cards are instant overseas transfer for purchases though. If I am just sending money to someone direct, it is either to a business for a purchase, or someone like a family member, so I am able to either transfer direct to their bank, or setup an account to transfer to that is instant, since it is not a one-off thing.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:36:19
I have specific people I transfer money to, mostly family in Australia, and I live in New Zealand.
I can transfer from my account to theirs and the money shows up about 15 minutes later.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:10:37
This doesn't work because of the way reddit algorithms work.
Low effort posts will always rise to the top, even if a majority of people dislike them.
@_date: 2013-12-21 07:18:08


Do you really believe this?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:06:27
It seems like a lot of them are acting as free advertising for businesses. When they figure out that they don't have to ever interact with BTC, because of bitpay and that they will just be receiving fiat, they add the Bitcoin button on their site and make a post here:


Which pulls in a few orders from the people on here who are in such a to the moon frenzy, or who have over speculated, that they buy things they don't need just to support BTC.
I see it all the time with Linux gamers.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:44:33
I liken it a little to the Linux advocates:
When they go into how FOSS is better because of free(speech) software, people think they are loonies and will stick to windows.
When they show them that Linux is faster, more stable, and more secure, people are happy to switch.
What you have to realize is that people are apathetic. You have to show them the utility of using it as a currency(of which it currently has almost none) before you start telling them about the ideological and moral reasons for using it. I am not saying that your reasons for advocating/using it are bad, but there has to be pragmatism in advocacy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:59:04
Bit isn't bitpay just an extra step in the process for users? Why would I buy BTC and then use bitpay/gyft if I can just use paypal/credit card/fiat?

I see, thank you. That makes a lot more sense to me than the "bitpay is zero risk for merchants" arguments I have seen, which also seem to negate its utility as a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:22:06
Problem with doing that is that the price was changing by $200-$300 in an hour the other day. So picking a time, to make the exchange could cost someone a massive amount 3 minutes later or earlier. I think the meaning of the OP was that it is just way too volatile right now and that it is more of a commodity than a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:26:07

@_date: 2013-12-19 04:32:46
No. You are talking about intrinsic value. I.E. value that comes from the thing itself, not just because that is what people are willing to pay for it. Gold will always have uses in industry and jewelry.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:26:12
Actually, thats wrong. A meme post will always get more upvotes in the first few seconds than a well thought out post that requires more effort to get through.
5 votes in the first minute carries more weight than 50 votes in the next 10 minutes, or 500 votes in the next hour. It is just the way reddit works.
Of course if it is a post which is heavily downvoted, it will disappear, but realistically, only troll posts get heavily downvoted in the first few minutes. Most of the others either get no votes or less upvotes, but rarely do things get downvoted.
Also, there is karma harvesting going on, which is super easy to do in a subreddit this size.  People are willing to turn this subreddit into shit just to get a few more points and then move on to the next victim.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:53:23
Well the intrinsic value is lower than the actual value. But it *does* have intrinsic value, whereas bitcoin has no intrinsic value, but it does have value because people are willing to put money into it.
The intrinsic value for jewelry is a lot higher than people think too.
