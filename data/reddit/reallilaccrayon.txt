Wallets don’t need ID or banks accounts to open. You are confusing them with an exchange.

Short answer - Yes

Gonna call bs.  Nice story though.  Nothing you say makes sense.  A simple link cannot take money from your mobile wallet.  What kind of mobile wallet exposes your private keys from clicking on an email link.

It’s wonderful that you have made the decision to buy bitcoin.
I highly suggest that you take your BTC off of coinbase and put it into your own wallet.  For the amount you have I suggest exodus as it’s easy to use and looks great also.
The reason you shouldn’t keep it on coinbase is because owning cryptocurrencies should be about learning how to own, transact and control your own digital assets.  Leaving it on coinbase doesn’t teach you this and ends up being nothing more than an investment similar to stocks.  Cryptocurrencies is so much more than just an investment and learning how to protect your digital assets is the first step you can take.

This is such a tragic video but the camera guy's voice is making this video too comedic

Exodus is an amazing wallet both in terms of features and design.  You should have a better understanding of how to transact on the blockchain before you randomly accuse them of being fraudulent.

That picture doesn’t prove you went through with that exchange.  
I believe you that you had issues with the wallet but looking at your BTC address, the last several transactions was just you sending yourself very small amounts of btc and racking up on fees.  I don’t understand how this happened; did you initiate all of these or do you not recall?
