Doesn't unpacking the gold bouillon actually reduce its liquidity and value???

It's probably a lot of nostalgia and selective amnesia. 
It's the same here in the ex-Czecho-Slovakia. People think back at the good ol' times, when everyone had a job and all was well. As if somehow that made up for all the suffering. Keep in mind that we were one of the luckier countries of the ost-block when it comes to the overall number of people killed, imprisoned, tortured, blackmailed, etc.

I'm just out here meme-ing man :D
No, you're right. This wasn't meant as an apology or defense of (any) state interventions. I can't really do anything about what other people think or say. I'm subbed to because of the entertainment value of the posters. Some of the art is really quite good and I have a weak spot for soviet-style propaganda art.

yeah. that might be so. There probably aren't that many old-timers left who grew up before 1953.

In 1950, by Stalin's personal order, one ruble was equated to 0.222168 grams of pure gold. As a result, the exchange rate of 53 rubles per dollar (1947) was changed to 4.45 rubles per dollar. Artist V. Vasiliev.

No worries. You couldn't have known if I am being serious or not. Yeah, reading through the comments on the original post is ... discouraging
