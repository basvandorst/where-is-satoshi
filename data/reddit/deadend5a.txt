If a random guy sitting in a park asks one of my children if they wanted some bitcoin(candy) and i noticed that i would beat the shit out of you. Even if u have good intentions with it u can get alot of trouble with this.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:57:38
All banks and most governments demonizing bitcoins, so the banks can stock them up while they are still cheap before the mass adoption begins, just have patience, every decade there's some new revolution going in this decade the monetary system is going to be changed alot i believe as people will wake up and will see the debts the world have are in some point unsustainable. I think the world only needs a big financial crisis again to let the people mass adopt in crypto, look to venezuela/zimbabwe.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:03:12
I dont care about fees, if i want to send some to another exchange i just sell some btc for eth or ltc and send it to get it there faster.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:30:55
More people have hard times, it is still not allowed to beg here.

This is just a coordinated bitcoin fud campaign to let wall street bankers buy cheap bitcoin on 15 januari when they recieve their yearly bonusses
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:56:30
No, it was all FUD fake news, the South Korean government even stated itself that its not planning to shut down cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:17:12
To be honest i think this might be a planned media fud attack on crypto so the wall street bankers can buy cheap at 15 januari when they recieve their bonusses.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:39:07
I am usually transfering some bitcoin into ethereum to send it faster to other exchanges where u can buy your bitcoin back again. Also litcoin is a good use for this.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:41:10
A problem is that there are so much crypto websites that temporarely disabled new user registrations because its to busy, this will slow down this.

Yes, i also saw real time on gdax 19799.98 dollar, it was crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:54:24
Is this one of the reasons why everything is dropping? 
the total market cap is descending pretty fast right now.
or just a normal correction of btc?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:45:07
I did read the wallet of the mining rewards got stolen.
But will this have impact on the btc? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:01:15
Investing more then u can afford to lose is bad, but ye at if this continues like this bitcoin is on 1 january 2018 around 63k. Cant be sure i also dont know whats going to happen.

Holy mother of Bitcoin, in 24 hours from 12 to 13k.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:20:13
I do agree CME futures doesnt increase demand, but these announcements were causing huge media attention worldwide for the bitcoin. And that is something that will increase the demand.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:21:13
Yes these panicsellers are all noobs that are FOMO'ing, and now they see a 1k price drop they sell. I hope they learn the hard way.

Bitcoin was like fuck it im not taking the stairs anymore, he stepped into the elevator.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:21
Bitcoin just started speeding up, soon 5k up each day.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:40:47
Yes, but i also think big exchanges should adopt segwit also, most starters will use coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:53:48
I hope this progress continue's like this id like to see what happens to the bitcoin if this is implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:08:18
Where can i follow the Rekt bot of CME? id love to see how people losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:43:07
Signed it! Its also real, my uncle finally wanted to get in bitcoin, downloaded a wallet, and after he bought a little (lucky he was) to try get some but after it didnt come in turns out to be bitcoin cash adress, and lost it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:37
Dont listen to this shit, the bankers want the hodlers to sell their bitcoin so the bankers can have it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:31:05
Dont buy directly off coinbase, go to Gdax (same company as coinbase) then deposit ur money there, and buy your bitcoin on the exchange, lots cheaper. and the deposit of euro or usd from coinbase to gdax=instant.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:39:29
I had same problems with my bank, i send an angry email, and 1 day later i was able to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:38:11
I love what Binance is doing, i accidently sold a bitcoin almost for around 1k instead 10k but Binance warned me with a popup that the price im selling it for is kinda off the market price.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:52:31
Dont pay that, maybe its outdated? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:45:34
Also on Binance the price is higher then on gdax, usually on Binance the price is more then 600 dollar cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:15
Bitcoin finished his rocket to go to the moon.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:55:52
They use fear to control the people, if we as community just ignore this we have the ability to destroy the people who have futures, lets make them all bankrupt!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:36:14
The activity on gdax is far less then last week, alot of people watching at the sidelines to see what is happening and when they see it isnt that bad i think alot of people will jump in again.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:40
The FUD campaign in holland is real, they only demonizing bitcoin ING bank saying its been used by mostly criminals/nerds/moneylaundrers. 
Also an documentary comes soon about cryptocurrency id like to see what they say about that, i think they just keep demonizing it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:24:17
I saw a 9500 euro to 7700 euro drop in less then 2 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:13
If all bitcoin owners gonna HODL then the price is just skyrocketing. HODLERS HAVE POWER!
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:52:37
It could happen that i die within an hour, it also is possible im still alive. 
If they really want to attack bitcoin they need to attack all exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:15:47
Bankers are causing much more shit in the world then bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:27:29
And what u mean with this? ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:56:13
If i was u i would transfer the bitcoin asap to an other wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:05:30
I agree with you there bankers/politicians dont like the Bitcoin, but i doubt an attack on coinbase or gdax would affect the price alot. And if it does, the guys with futures are getting rekt!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:31:01
I think this needs to be in @_date: 2017-12-16 14:48:56
Futures have zero effect, 1 day after futures launched 93% of the people already took their hands of the futures because they seen so many people lose their money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:35:34
I think that will be great for the bitcoin, because people will get anxious they lose money and they will put it in bitcoin, look what bitcoin does in zimbabwe/venezuela.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:59:36
At btc all time highs i trade my bitcoin for altcoins, the altcoins are always alot lower when the bitcoin is having a rush. then when the price stabilizes the altcoins gain alot of % up again, usually when that happens and the money starts pouring into the altcoins the bitcoin price will go lower again and when i think its the time i just convert all to bitcoin again. and will rise to the new ath and repeat.
Till now i didnt had any big losses yet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:51
Damn, i just started a month ago already doubled my money, but congratulations to you thats a nice profit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:08:20
But they are going to use only the Gemini exchange for futures right?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:35:11
Gdax and Coinbase are the same company thus allowing u to deposit your bitcoin to gdax instantly and no fees. 
Then send your bitcoin to an electrum wallet, that way u dont pay to much fee. U can also directly send it from coinbase to your electrumwallet, but Coinbase is known for huge fees. The first option is cheapest but u have to do some extra more mouseclicks.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:45:33
I bought at all time high 7300 usd, just after i bought the segwit b2x fork was cancelled and bitcoin dipped back to 4800 usd, but i kept hodling and im pretty happy right now! Just think in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:38:46
This is kinda like begging for bitcoin, not allowed. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:22:43
I think u will need your parents to cash out that bitcoin on a exchange or company. or HODL till 18 years.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:52:44
If the cryptokitties arent breaking their network...
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:23:47
What news? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:24:29
Media companies are cooping with cme/cboe to try control the people with fear and they try to manipulate the price down so they can buy cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:26:47
Damn that sucks, i also fell a bit for the scam, traded my bitcoin for bcash, but then i had a feeling it didnt felt right and i sold it before the dump and made some profit of it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:19:09
Fear is being used by governments to control. 
But look at the other side of it, if people buy futures and the bitcoin does what the bitcoin did this week, those people with futures will go bankrupt very fast, and thats a good thing! Thats also the reason why bankers are affraid of the effects of the futures.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:04:39
On Gdax the btc/eur already hit 11199 euro, thats 13.229
fking dollars!

Nope, normal FIAT and real gold mining costs way more electricity + goldmining fucks up the environment.

Spending time reading stuff reading news checking coinmarketcap every 10 minutes and once u are into it u can start to see some paterns what happens all the time and u can use that to make money. But im spending also at least 6 hours a day reading stuff looking charts looking for news.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:48:00
Maybe a bit offtopic, but im watching the Bitmexrekt twitter account to see how much money people are losing on futures and i love it, but is there also a rekt bot for CBOE and CME?

This is no crash, this is a healthy correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:07:07
I can. I live in The Netherlands, and we have the Rabobank here, back in 2013 my dad tried to purchase some bitcoins, but when he tried to pay for them through Ideal (instant online payment) it refused all the time, then he tried to pay a bill, and he got no problems, he send 10 euro to my daughter no problems, back on the bitcoin website the payment got refused again, and after sending an angry email he got an apology back. Banks do not want to see money go into crypto.

Some reasons might be the fees and unconfirmed transactions, but also all altcoins are dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:49:03
Correction? Bitcoin is having an hour break now, after the break he will pick up the sledgehammer, and smash the 16k sell walls.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:03:55
Ye u will still make money, but with altcoins u can make lots more money, but also lose lots more. if u put for example 500 usd back in 2014 in einsteinium u got now around 5 millions usd.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:46:45
I prefer a correction to 15k

Where u got this info from if i may ask?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:55:59
It might be yes, personally i think alot of people watching at the sidelines right now to look what the futures will do to the bitcoin. And once they see it is not that bad theres a big change alot of people will jump in again.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:45:06

Well it is correcting at this moment. not yet a crash but correction.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:13:58
Futures dont even involve real bitcoin, they are just betting on the price of bitcoin, its only the bitcoin community is a bit influenced by the FUD. If bitcoin does what it did last week they will lose tons of money with their futures.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:09
When i tried to buy bitcoin at start in 2013 my bank Rabobank in The Netherlands also blocked the transaction, but then we send an angry email and after we were able to buy the bitcoin. Banks are shitting their pants for crypto's.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:12:27
Yes bitcoin took the elevator now instead of the stairs, is anyone else nervous when they look at the charts now?

As beginner its safest to just buy some bitcoin, go read some stuff about bitcoin and ico's altcoins, and watch the charts of the coins your interested in, and if ur confident enough u could eventually send the bitcoin to an exchange to trade it there.

its worth around 0.90 cent, but in 2014 it was 0.000073 usd cents.
go calculate the % increase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:54
Indeed what HiAmNewHere says, transfer money to coinbase, deposit to gdax(gdax is coinbase) and depositing is instant from coinbase to gdax. and because u buy the bitcoin through the exchange u pay less fee, and if u use Limit buy order u will pay zero fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:45:40
Bitcoin had crashes of 80% before, be happy few weeks ago it was still 10k. +10000 rise is OK, but 2500 drop and people getting scared :P, its funny.

With the money printing the US is doing since 2008 i dont believe the dollar is long sustainable. Same with the Euro, the ECB is printing so much money to decrease interest rate on debts of countries. Once they stop with this countries like Italy have to pay so much interest rate that italy becomes the next greece crisis in europe. This will cause a new crisis and may be a chainreaction in other european countries. Maybe more countries want an Euro Exit. And those fuckers in Brussel will do anything to prevent that the euro will fail so the ECB happily keeps printing money till the euro bubble also bursts and we will have a huge crisis in europe, im happy with the idea i got some money in cryto's.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:18:46
What i might think is when the CME trading go's on they create infinite amounts of imaginary bitcoins to trade, and that they will create a fabricated bubble of the bitcoin.

If u have the seed/private key of your bitcoin core wallet u should be fine, but if u dont have them i think u might deleted your bitcoins then yes, if u deleted files they still might by in the Recycle bin, if u also deleted them there download Recuva and try recover the files. What else u can try to search in hidden folders C:/users/(your username)/Appdata as far as i know wallets sometimes store backup files in those hidden maps.

Alright, thanks for the fast response, i was a little worried seems i just need some patience ^^. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:47:18
If u have them in your private wallet u will be able to claim them later with your seed/private keys. if u have the bitcoins u own on a exchange it depends on how the exchange is treating forks. I just send my bitcoins to Binance, then u didnt have to do anything.

I got some money in stocks, decided 1 week ago to buy bitcoin, I had a rly hard time to hodl my first bitcoin when i saw it drop with more then 1k loss. feel like being mentally raped right now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:46:09
hm, alright thanks although im not hoping it will succeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:19:09
I got absolutely no problems with coinbase, opened 2 support tickets this week, both answered within 2 days, made 2 sepa transfers and they were on coinbase within 1 business day. If i was u i would create a new case on their support website.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:09:17
Bcash price 1027 right now, it is even more fun to watch them go down then to see the bitcoin going up! cant wait to see 999&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:03:39
ah did some research that website running on the same server as thebitgoldmine.org which was also a scam website.

Im searching google coinbase blog twitter, but cant find any update. all i know for now is that it got stuck on block 494782. But i do noticed on my coinbase account that the warning of maintenance has dissappeared of the segwit update.

With the rate the bitcoin is rising im happily paying those fees.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:47:42
This is what i can find on amazon.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:28:04
Did u try opening a case on their support website? last week i opened 2 cases and both got answered within 2 days.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:03:41
I hope she is right, and if she is go visit her again!

Minimum order is 0.01 bitcoin.
I think the order is to small. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:48:18
most of the day it was 400+ dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:07:51
I doubt its from the ransomware itselves, i think its probably the massive media attention world wide. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:26:53
they told me that at block 494784 will bitcoin split, but its past that already, how is it so that the fork still has to happen? (im sry, following bitcoin long time, but not really know this logic.)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:56
9000 buy orders got triggered, so it was 9k already.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:39:50
People warned me for replay attacks when claiming bitcoin gold if u enter the private key/seed in that official wallet of them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:51:00
Im ready to go over 9000!
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:19:59
Soon, when the bitcoin becomes mainstream and the millionaires/billionaires all want to own at least 1 bitcoin the price will skyrocket that is what i believe as there are only a max amount of bitcoin.

Buy more bitcoin for more income!
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:17:56
Before the fork i transfered my bitcoin to Binance, and yes i got 10 bcd for each bitcoin. thats because bitcoin diamond has a total of 210 million instead of 21 mil.

Tesla one of the most unappreciated inventors/scientists ever. When Albert Einstein was asked how it is to be the smartest man in the world, he answered 'I will ask Tesla the next time i see him' I honestly think if the FBI didnt seize his inventions/technology/knowledge when he died. We would be driving electric cars in 1975 already. This technology is being surpressed by agencies/elites.

The Bankers wish it is a bubble, they are shitting their pants of cryptocurrency. so they keep demonizing bitcoin/cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:42:38
2FA has nothing to do with your private keys or recovery seed, because u have your bitcoins on coinbase they own your keys. and they are not giving it to you. but ye if u lose your phone with the authenticator on it and u dont have the 2FA recovery key u going to have trouble to get into your account.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:18:01
Im not sure, today it seems the bitcoin forgot how to brake.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:04:18
I read alot of hate on coinbase, im also using it but i dont have any problems. But i live in the Netherlands.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:45:39
Ye this scared me also, but i learned from the drop on 12 November to just HODL TIGHT!
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:03:06
Everyday news, all bankers/government are demonizing the bitcoin all the time every day, its just to spread fear in the herds of the sheeple. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:34:18
Yep your right, i have the same issue more then 3 phishing mails each day, mostly they come in my spam folder, but sometimes they dont. watch out!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:40:45
Any know causes? or just the casual?

I like Gdax i only wish they had support for more currencies, Miota/neo/monero etc.

'imagine Bitcoin and a bank. Now imagine Bitcoin in that bank. Further, imagine earning interest on your Bitcoins from that bank. Not such a bad idea, right?' 
I think that one of the reasons Bitcoin was created to be independent from the Banking cartels. Crap article.

This is around the 5 story in less then 3 days that this happens on a blockchain wallet. Is there a security breach or something going on?
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:04:22
If u keep coins on a website like coinbase or any other exchange it means THEY have your private keys and therefore they OWN your bitcoins. in a hardware wallet or software wallet u can export your private keys/seeds, or gets created when u run a wallet for the first time. The one who owns your private keys owns your bitcoins basically.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:58:07
I have the same... whats happening?
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:22:59
The first picture should be bitcoin cash right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:44:17
Yes it is real, it started with a tweet yesterday of coinbase.
But does anyone know if this will affect the bitcoin? if the fork succeeds?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:12
Since 5 weeks im watching the charts of bitcoin, but today when i looked at the EURO/BTC charts it went down from 9500 to 7700 it scared me quite a bit.

I bought bitcoin 1 week ago for the first time, been following it since 2012 (i know im being a retard for not buying back then.) the price back then was 7450, just make sure if u buy bitcoin and u see the price falling down that u dont panic sell it. I tried to panick sell it when it was 6100, but the transaction came to late so i got it refunded. and now im very happy i still have my bitcoin. I learned that this week.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:17:39
Doing the same several times, and did sepa deposit yesterday evening, was told 2 business days, but within 12 hours it was on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:27
so if that block is here and we see a b2x coin, what will happen to bitcoin? will the price dip again?
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:15:29

ye it is happening, but i do have a question, coinbase disabled sending and recieves for now, but does that also count for Gdax now? because coinbase=gdax
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:34:08
All bitcoin adresses that will be generated will stay on your account, so yes it should be possible, but if u are not sure u can also deposit it on coinbase, then transfer to Gdax.
Transfering from coinbase to gdax and vice versa is free and instant.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:28:01
Im not sure, but might be they editing their ToS? 
I read that bittrex updated their ToS that if some whales want to pump and dump their accounts getting closed/blocked, i personally think this is a very good thing to do with all the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:41:29
Bitcoin is rising really fast right now, usually at a new ATH u have little bit of a dip before reaching a new ath.

Mugabe printing trillions of extra dollars causing hyperinflation in Zimbabwe. Normal money isnt worth anything there so they convert it to bitcoin because if they earn 10 dollar today, tomorrow that 10 dollar is worth 4 dollar.

Ugh, it keeps hanging around 7950-7990.

I dont think its to late, but exchanges will close your account when u try to verify your account as minor.
Think u will need ur parents help.

if bitcoin becomes mainstream and every billionaire and millionaire wants 1 bitcoin, im not so sure there will be a limit.
