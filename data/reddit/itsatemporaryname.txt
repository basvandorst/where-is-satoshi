Why another 5 years?

Also if you send from GDAX instead of coinbase (same company/account) they cover the txn fee

I mean the casacius coin guy also still has the private keys if he kept them, it states on his site that there's a huge trust element but he made all his personal info available to compensate

Well, aside from the txn fee, other exchanges are significantly lower than say gdax, so you could wire/buy from bittrex and transfer to gdax, then sell at a premium...lots of assumptions on the market staying stable or bullish but i'm surprised the intra-exchange to fiat arbitrage hasn't happened more

Which fork?

I really want 5k for a few days so I can load up
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:52:03
Verify on coinbase instead of gdax, j could never get it to work if I tried to do it on gdax

BCH could do a 51% attack?

So to spend these you basically have to go to a wallet and sign the txn with your private key right? And if course you have to trust the camera/website to not steal the key. Are the wallets reusable?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:12:49
But if you can't move the coin then you can't capture the arbitrage

By definition hodlers aren't trading so minimal control

How do the derivatives work?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:05:58
Exodus is a software wallet (on your computer, you control the private keys) that supports multiple cryptocurrencies (etherium + various tokens, LTC, ETH, BTC, Bcash, etc) It also plugs into the shapeshift.io API, so within the program you can say that you want to swap X amount of LTC for BTC, and it will perform the swap. Much faster than sending to an exchange and waiting for it to clear. It's also well designed (unlike 90% of wallets today). Check it out!

You buy through an exchange, like Coinbase/GDAX/Bittrex/Kraken/Binance/etc. You wire USD and use it to buy bitcoin

Unrealized gains
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:41:14
They blocked it

GDAX has insurance, nicehash did not
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:09:45
Much much much lower. Mining requires extensive hashing, those other methods don't

Can be or is?

Dude don't cold storage such small amounts, wait until you have line 2-500, seriously you're throwing 60% of your investment away
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:05:16
You can use a wallet like exodus, has shapeshift integration

Why did you give him 1k?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:43:23
Which exchange is that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:42:33
Money laundering and KYC type laws

Share the wealth

CBA you just buy in foreign markets then?

How long is the longest bearish market in bitcoin history?
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:19:22
Just replenish the purchase with with right after
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:26:14
But if you show a transaction as invalid while a larger mining pool shows it as valid, would you input be recognized or discarded?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:38:56
Those people could dump tether into ETH or tokens and xfer those to cross out, it would drag down the entire market
