You clearly missed the point. Bitcoin is more useful as the real value normalizes. I would pay the price of having my wallet value drop just to see the value normalize and be happy knowing that was the last time.

What I mean is that you can have 98% transactions being just bogus transactions to test the blockchain. That is only 2% of retail transactions. So that is not just one day, that is over a long term period. Then it would be dishonest to say that it is becoming more popular because there are more transactions. No, the only thing that changed was a simulated stress test. It would be like looking at foot traffic at a retail store and saying that you were killing it because 1000 more people showed up than usual, when in reality they were just there to look an not buy. So my concern is that if there is an upward trend in transactions, how do we have reasonable assurance that all of they transactions are legit?

He is just beating the clickbait authors to it :P

How do you differentiate between retail or financial, and stress test transactions?  
@_date: 2016-01-25 20:55:59
Yes, it would, I would want to cry.  Then I would buy more BTC.

Even if the price of bitcoin falls lower I would be fine with it so long as that price stabilizes in real value terms. Hell, if it fell to $100 US (Jan 2016) but stayed there for 5 years, I would be ecstatic.

I did use Coinbase, and I will keep this in mind if they issue a refund.

Funny you mention that, yes I did do just that.


   
Yes, I imagine so :(
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:01:33
If nothing else comes of this, fine, because this is hilarious.

I used Coinbase using copy paste method.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:51:03
Indeed they did, thanks!

Bitpay got on the scene fast, thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:45:35
Yes! Bitpay were the people to talk to and it is getting reversed :)
@_date: 2015-04-22 04:03:18
Yes, absolutely nothing wrong with BTC. I am a big fan of Bitcoin. I pay my barber with it :D I am not trying to find fault here, just to find out what my best options are short of contacting the website support. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 17:28:19
No, i have never heard of it.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:51:08
Right? I provided the email support with both addresses so we will see what they do. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:42:30
I agree; it looks like my ignorance is the culprit here.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:46:16
What worries me is there is no record of the invoice and the page printed that the transaction was cancelled. I will keep hoping for  a response.
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:49:52
Yes, Bitpay is now working on a refund. Thanks!

He sounds like he is pleading with policy makers to reconsider regulating Bitcoin. As though that were even possible... WELL I suppose at registers for brick and mortar and larger pervasive  public corporations, it will be easy for them to look into the finances. But for the day to day, BTC is hardly controllable. I would love them to try and regulate it, just to see what happens.
