You’re completely wrong - they want you to profit like crazy. They don’t get to take your money when it moves the other direction. Hire an accountant if you’re up that much and enjoy it.

I think it’s when someone creates a fake internet money coin and then convinces people to spend $1,000’s of dollars mining it and even more money buying and trading it, even though it is slow, expensive to move, and can’t be used anywhere except to trade for other scam coins.

Haha, when’s the last time you checked the daily volume? I guess you’re technically correct, but it’ll never happen.

Why are you buying back in at this level? The fact that you sold makes me think you’re in it for profit and not some altruistic save the world crap - which is totally fine. But, if that’s the case, why buy in now? You’re not gonna see any kind of return like you already have. Might as well celebrate or get into alt-coins and try your luck again.

But you would have the added benefit of needing to file quarterly returns instead of once a year, so there’s that.

What jobs would you recommend for my 3 year old? The kid isn’t making anywhere near $20,000 a year. I’ve been telling my wife for the last 2 1/2 years that the kid is lazy, and she keeps trying to baby him.

Maybe we need some entity to protect and insure our bitcoin. The law of large numbers would suggest we use a single organization to handle this as they’d be able to best mitigate the risk. How would we go about setting up a centralized entity that guarantees our investments?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:25:34
Thank you, I was expecting people to be offended and call me out as a Roger Ver Fudster or something. The truth is, I’m having a lot of fun with this stuff and hoping I don’t lose it all since my wife has no idea how much I’ve invested. I think you’re right too, I do know myself better than most. There is one expecting though, and that would be your mom, she knows me really well, and I was thinking you could get her opinion for me.

@_date: 2017-12-17 20:34:45
It was a joke. This guy has gone to extreme lengths to protect his bits. I stayed thinking about dollars, and no one would ever do anything like this (no one who didn’t live through the depression anyways). They’d put their money in banks, knowing it’s safe. They’d work with a lawyer and/or advisor if they had a size-able amount. Maybe crypto will get there, but for now it’s kind of a strange Wild West with people literally burying their money (keys) to keep it safe. 
I know many here would be completely opposed to any sort of government or centralized way of protecting their investment, but I don’t think we’ll see true mainstream adoption until someone can safely invest a chuck of their net worth without the fear that a lost password could mean losing it all.

Hold up, relax and take notes. It’s not even homophobic, it’s just science. Unless one dick is uncircumcised (and we don’t have enough evidence here to suggest one is), then they can’t physically mix the same way a vagina and dick can. Now, if one was uncircumcised , then the other could slide into the foreskin of said uncircumcised wiener and “mix” but to throw out the homophobe card when someone was just stating facts is plain wrong.

This story is 100% true. The banker had a rare cancer and has been fighting it for years.

Can you explain how the terms would work please? If I buy your house for $300k in ETH and 6 months later I find mold (or some other violation of the terms), how do I get my money back if you've already spent it on your next house? 
Would the seller of your next home (or whatever you spent the $300k on) get screwed as those coins are sent back to me?

Thanks. I have also entered some ETH into Blockfolio and was hoping to see my overall performance - meaning all of my coins (BTC, ETH, and any others I buy in the future). 
It's not a huge deal if I can't, I was just thinking it'd be nice to see how I'm doing overall with these coins.

Not my business, but this post sounds like someone about to make irrational decisions. Credit cards and the fastest option possible? Can you afford to pay the credit card off if bitcoin drops to $3,000 tomorrow? 
It doesn't seem like that will happen and it seems like the 4% cc fee is nothing compared to the growth btc is experiencing, but is it smart?
I'm not very risk averse.

I'm on the mobile app and I don't see any buttons on the 'My Portfolio' screen. Are you using the app or the website?
Edit - I can click in 'Holdings' under each individual coin, but I was hoping to see my overall performance in one place. Is that possible?

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:47
Market Cap isn’t meant to tell you how much has been invested. It’s a way to estimate the total value of bitcoin (all coins times current price per coin). I think you’re confusing things here. 
I don’t know if there’s any way to know how much has actually been invested, but what would you need that for anyways? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 04:33:17
So, you’re saying the USD is well past the danger zone of failing and we should be safe with it?
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:37:19
I guess I misread. I though since the USD is over 100 years old that were statistically not likely to fail, based on the data you shared. I didn’t see any mention of debt in relation to failure.

I had an MRI in the US this year and paid $350. I have a high deductible plan, so that $350 was the total cost. You guys may want to shop around if you’re paying $10K.

I have one good reason why someone would do that. I can think of a few others off the top of my head. Concentrate real hard and you'll probably think of some good reasons too.

Give me one minute to read the article first. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:34:28
That wasn't a smug answer, I listed 7-10 reasons why someone might accept BTC and immediately cash out. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:25:10
So, they had the same thought as 98.623% of everyone involved in crypto?
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:42:24
Good. I love me some Jack in the Box too. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:27:21
Here's a few ideas
- seller doesn't want a significant amount of his net worth tied up in a risky speculative cryptocurrency
- seller wanted to buy something and it wasn't available in Overstock.com so she had to cash out
- seller owes back taxes and needed cash since the IRS doesn't accept bitcoin yet
- seller needed to payoff a mortgage and the bank doesn't accept bitcoin
- sellers spouse doesn't believe in cryptocurrency and forced seller to cash out rather than risk everything on dumb internet money  
- seller agreed to this form of payment even though she immediately lost 1% to exchange fees as a closing concession because buyer didn't want to eat those fees
- seller is a believer in cryptocurrency and tried to do everything she can in BTC, even if it costs more, in an effort to spread the BTC gospel and then cashed out for one of the reasons listed above
- seller planned to hodl but something came up forcing her to sell (health issue, house flooded from Harvey, nephew needed college money....)
- seller is dumb and didn't think it through 
There's some ideas to get you started. As you get older, you'll find that the world isn't black and white, and people do things for all sorts of reasons (sometimes for reasons you may disagree with or not understand). It's helpful to think outside the box and try to understand others and their motivations. Write that down and keep hodling.

@_date: 2017-09-21 02:20:31
Maybe, and this is just a crazy theory, they need cash to buy a new home that will replace the one they just sold. And, another crazy idea coming, maybe they couldn't find a seller willing to take BTC as payment since 99% of the world isn't using BTC at all and most of the 1% who are using it are just sitting on it and dreaming about the rari they're gonna buy some day. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:47:21
Sorry, I shouldn't have responded that way. Sometimes I can't help myself and resort to sarcasm when I read really dumb questions online. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:41:33
Reread my list, there's plenty of reasons why the seller may not have taken cash instead. Spend a little time on this sub and you'll quickly learn that there's a ton of really dumb people here who've convinced themselves they're gonna be millionaires since they bought $2,000 worth of BTC last month. 
I can easily see them taking BTC for some dumb reason. A normal person probably wouldn't take the BTC only to cash out. Unless, there was an unexpected emergency (which I listed) or it was a requirement from the buyer (which I also listed) and they felt like they had no better offers. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:41:58
Because the average person is dumb and the rest of us end up covering their bills when they make a bad bet. Look at all the idiots buying crypto on credit cards at all time highs. You want to open them up to a bunch of snake oil salesmen promising the next Facebook?
