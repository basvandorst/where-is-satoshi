No. No. and No.
"Necessary evil" is an oxymoron. Evil is inherently wrong and wrong implies an alternative (right, or good). Alternatives and necessity cannot coexist, since the definition of "necessity" is that of explicit requirement (no alternative).
Aside from philosophy, the answer is NO.
KYC and ID verification are tools of control you cleverly disguised as implements of protection.

**Not their keys, not their Bitcoin.**
A lot of people aren't woken up to this yet, but I believe this is totally true.
Crypto brings a new era of freedom. I do think we're going to be able to move away from the State syphoning money out of individuals for big projects.
In US for example, as we move to crypto as a currency we have power over where that money goes. And with the privacy features how much we have will be obscured. This is really good, it means that people are free. If you want to pay to support a cause or an organization, you may. If you don't want to, it's much more difficult for the State to come take your money.
Unfortunately, most of the world is not free enough to make the transition without a lot of bloodshed. The State does not want to cede power and control. Imagine not caring who the next president was... Because really they didn't get to decide who to war with, which walls to build, etc.
A lot of countries will legislate against crypto and the State there has so much power that they can keep people under their boot. What are the people going to do if the government comes into their homes and destroys or steals their electronics?
In US, that can't happen easily. The people have just enough freedom (and arms) to defend against such authoritarianism. So the transition will be *more* smooth (not totally smooth).
