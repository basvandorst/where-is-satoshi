By fat the douchiest post yet. An the responses - even douchier than the chain of 'seconded' posts after a new dog was posted with name 'Satoshi' proposed. I wonder how many of you are genuine original miners. Not many I think. This was never originally about you newbs looking for moons. It was about alternative decentralized currency for the masses.

I won't be blaming my mental health and/or happiness on crypto. Actually, I'm happier and more alive since I got into crypto  - much more. My health is a thing that has slipped a bit from it but it's Winter so that kind of happens to me this time of year anyway.

That's not for sure. After all the hype around all the new consensus algorithms settles down, Bitcoin needs to pick one and go with it for an upgrade/fork from the Core devs. I think 2019 at the latest should be upgrade time. I don't care about the net effect if it involves using Lightning. I will settle for Bitcoin Cash. It's not just about making money. I want to use this stuff to **buy things**, and Bitcoin is really just a settlement layer now. I'm not into settlement layers on its own. I really want 2 things.
1) A fast pow crypto that I can use to buy stuff
2) has good difficulty like Bitcoin to sustain it's value and store of wealth
I would like some kind of Hashgraph fork of Bitcoin, that is forked BY the core devs. I want to love the coin I hodl.

Everyone in cryto has some regrets. It's inevitable. What's important is to learn from your mistakes and pick yourself up. Not just in crypto but the next big thing after, in .. 10 years.

Can I get a smart contract for that? ;) Trying to tell myself I'm joking. Failing!
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:53:24
Only a little. It doesnt have to be hashgraph, and I know hashgraph isn't yet open source but I would like to see an algorithm change.
I accept that there is massive politics in play with all this.

hindsight is a 20/20 but it's also useful to see where you could have made money. Each to their own. Give me a choice between having some regrets but still being active in crypto in 20 years, or less regrets (probably more regrets I didn't at least get in at all) and stuck with the fiat money and my inevitable demise. It's not like we have much of a choice.

That's right cryptochangements34. &amp; it was never going to be about just one crypto currency. Just being in crypto is what's most important. I wish I embraced it earlier but I'm glad I finally did. It may not be the future but it's the best thing to happen to financial world since the Romans used salt as a currency or further back.
Once you join crypto you never go back and I'm in it for payments based on a good store of wealth. It has to be scarce asset that can't be inflated but also fast and with low fees. Crypto ticks those boxes and it's exciting times. How could one ever truly leave crypto once they are in. What is more exciting right now? I can't think of anything. Even drones for people who are into that, can do much cooler things through crypto. 
There's plenty more to come from this and the 3rd. world cant be left behind and isn't going to be.

;) hindsight. It's like when someone tells you, buy the lows sell the highs. Yeah that's great in principle, how do you know when it's lowest and when it's highest over a period of time. Noone knows.
Back then that was the rate for a few pizzas. That's how it goes!

I feel regret and inspiration all in one with crypto. 
On the one hand, that goofy f***ers that never knew anything about the tech or the economics and just bought into the fomo blindly and I didn't depresses me sometimes, and that I wasn't open minded enough and confident enough to try and help overthrow the failed fiat system. I didn't feel money was the problem in society and now I now it is certainly part of it, a large part. :/
On the other hand, there are at least some poor yet intelligent and interesting people - genuine cypherpunks - who had no money but hated the system and rebelled against it, hated central banks and those guys made it, some of them at least!!
If you were really true to yourself about how you feel about what bankers have done to this world, and actually embraced alternatives and STUCK by them, you could have had great rewards. How is that not inspiring?
That makes me want to go on living, and I'm not joking!! : )

I think it's yet to come. And by that I mean our next leader community coin, not some shitty FIAT sovereign debt basket or something. 
It might be some kind of Bitcoin airdrop. 
If there was a Bitcoin airdrop that is low energy POW - problem set gamified in time (temporal) instead of hashing power - the really hard part, with a fast block lattice consensus, capped at 21 million with mining fee paid through inflation that asymptotically gets close to zero as you get to 21 million, maybe 16 decimals instead of 8. Something like that would be nice.  Named 'Bitcoin Pay' or something. And after all that it would have to survive years of rigour like Bitcoin did. Only then would it be worthy to dethrone the master. 
I think the perfect coin will come but to satisfy the community, it might have to be a Bitcoin airdrop, or a spork like Bitcoin Private to keep everyone happy. It will have the perfect blend of low energy use, sustainable inflation to reward miners, fast throughput and a hard maximum supply. It will come I think.
 
Most altcoins crash harder than bitcoin but they recover quicker too. 
You can see the really shit coins - they are the ones that don't recover even though they had a low market cap. There's ones still crashing now even after the bounce.

I want to get my portfolio locked in. Moving too much between coins is never a good iea unless you are a season full time pro day trader which I am not. Once I commit to my portfolio, I will check less often. What makes me check more is I'm not finihed it, ICO's and sniffing for other opportunities due to the first 2 points.

the lightning network (IOU nonsense for banks) is an insult to the true spirit of a decentralized currencies and the rightful heir apparent, Bitcoin (BCH). Roger Ver has been in Bitcoin before all you lightning worshippers no doubt.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't need to make a move. They state publicly that base block size increases is mainly how they will scale. If you don't like Bitcoin Cash / BCash, don't use it. Nobody cares that you expect them to make a move.

I think it's to signify that the USD used to be a legit currency backed by gold. So they're saying it's the death of a currency that was already crucified prior.

You don't seem to understand that XMR is like the Bitcoin of the dark web.
