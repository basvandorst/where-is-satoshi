Sounds like these guys need help from some bitcoin currency traders to manage this for them in an orderly manner.  A new career for someone has just been born!

This is exactly the sort of thing that will damage public support for bitcoin.  It really makes me wonder about your motives.  Are you really a bitcoin supporter, or trying to bring it down?  Vandalism is really not going to advance our cause!

I suppose it is too much to expect, but if Mt Gox was a "real" exchange it would take a look at this transaction and ban the user if they are manipulating the market.

Just messing around trying to get som ballpark numbers for possible values of bitcoin.  To my mind the value has a maximum of $56,000 (it won't end up better than US dollars).  If it ends up being a "real" currency, we should compare it to the value of other currencies - so take the total value on issue for some other currencies and divide by roughly 11 million BTC on issue.  That gave me around $10k for some middling nations.
Clearly that is just one way of trying to get a handle on the value of bitcoin.  If others have better alternatives, I am all ears!

I know you are being funny, but it is not about a warning.  Any currency trader with half a clue wanting to sell $2 million worth in a relatively small market would have broken the trade up into 10 or 20 smaller trades and dribbled them out over a few hours.  Hence the 'noob' tag.

Bitcoin speculators are having a bet on which 'black swan' wins out.  Worldwide adoption =&gt; amazing Bitcoin price OR collapse / ban / fad = near zero price.
If we assume there are only those 2 states of the world and the good state would lead to a price of $10,000 (making Bitcoin equivalent to the currency of a middling nation like Brazil), then a price of $130 means the market is implying a 1 in 80 chance of the 'good' state.

Bitcoin's early adoption by Silk Road and popularity with some pretty loopy libertarians are unfortunate and hard for some to get over.
In my opinion one of the dumbest things a crim could do would be to sit down at a computer and make a record of their transactions.  The only thing that would be more stupid would be to publish that record on a public 'block chain'.

Definitely not a money maker right now.  Difficulty to increase 25% this week.  Investment in GPU will never pay itself off.
Mine for fun on GPU or invest in ASIC.

Yes - Bitcoin not covered as not backed by anything!

There is nothing to "shut down"! The blockchain is everywhere.  If the authorities had this ability for p2p applications they would have shut down torrents 5 years ago.
They can attack exchanges and possibly even ban acceptance of BTC by businesses, but stopping BTC for p2p transactions cannot be done.

The coinlab.com market depth graph is fascinating.  I am a former finance professor.  Market fundamentals always win out over any short-term market microstructure issues.  If bitcoins were 'worth' 130 before someone decided to dump 20k they are still worth 130 now.  A short term supply glut can't change the fundamental value of a financial asset.
Hence my original question - where is the news? My wife saw the crash and said "what!? Is the world ending? - check CNN". :)

Why take the risk? A bank transfer will cost you a few dollars?

Not so surprising.  I had a telephone call the first time I bought a game on Steam.  Australian banks seem to have profiles of each client that throw up a red flag when something looks strange.
We should see the silver lining in this cloud.  The problems with card fraud in a global economy have forced the banks to take some pretty extreme measures! Bitcoin can make a massive contribution to the global economy by eliminating fraud and saving the costs of fraud prevention measures.

Don't fall for it people - user has been on reddit for a total of 17 hours.  Here to bring us down.  Would AgorismProject like to reveal who is having them try to label Bitcoin users as vandals?

There are $1.19 trillion US dollars in circulation: 
A $266 price was the market's best guess of the value at that time - nobody is saying that it is easy to guess the probability of bitcoin reaching widespread adoption!

1 in 80 is roughly what you get by dividing 10,000 by 130.

This will land the user in jail once the police seize you computer / spy on you via your ISP / plant a spyware bug in you computer.  The only reason people think it is all ok so far is because the police can't be bothered with the small fry.

That is what the market had decided before the sell order.  Presumably it reflects the cumulative wisdom of the market as to the value of bitcoin. 
 I have tried to get some ballpark numbers by comparing bitcoin to other currencies.  If it becomes as useful as $US (very unlikely), then each bitcoin will be worth $56,000.  If acceptance by businesses is banned it will be worth near zero, if it forks and collapses it will be worth near zero. 
The market struggles every day to determine the probabilities of each of the likely outcomes for bitcoin, and the price reflects our combined judgment of those probabilities.
