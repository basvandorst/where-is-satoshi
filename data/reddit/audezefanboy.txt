This is a terrible idea. Even if you're going aggressive with your 401k, please don't put your eggs in one basket. 
If you take a 10% risk which doubles your money, 10 times with all your money. Then you're going to lose all your money. Diversify bro.   
If you're only doing this to a small amount of your 401k, then disregard this message.

The solution would be to have people confirm before they're able to push the button.

Miners are flooding the market with their coins. Other people are getting lots of coins illicitly and want to change them for fiat. 
There's other unknowns. But hopefully it doesn't fall too much more. 
Edit: it fell more

I started with 


I'm optimistic because I like bitcoin. But I don't want to trick others into buying it because I've lost a lot of money myself. Hence cautious. I don't know shit about markets. 
I said it because I'm hopeful, but I've lost enough to know better than to get my hopes up. 
If I was completely optimistic, I'd be called delusional. If I was negative, I'd be told to get the hell off I'm lukewarm, and apparently you guys don't like that either. I don't get it. What's with trying to oppose everyone's opinions? Why fight counter to everyone? 
Instead of citing a source about the phrase not being good to use, why not explain what you think about bitcoin's price. Just quoting someone to deride others is kinda lame and it doesn't help.

Thanks. People make fun if those that go through this as being saps. But they have never experienced being poor with no way out. Gambling is enticing even if you know you will lose, because it offers the hope that you might not. Have a nice day man.

Forced to sell to cut losses. I can't wait years with money tied up at a loss, never being able to touch it.
It dropping to 100, would dramatically hurt many of us. Losing half of its value, is also never good for a currency or store of value.

You rock mate. Let's feed them! Donate my bits to the charity.

I'm going to gamble it, is that okay?

Investors won't back the companies if they take on unnecessary risks like that. It's also probably illegal to do that.

I'm not sure, but I'm cautiously optimistic.

If it hits 100 dollars, then many of us will break.
