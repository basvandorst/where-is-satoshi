I can hear the dump trucks backing up now, BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP.

It will be dumped eventually and the price will probably drop down to around $50, Then it will BE pumped and dumped again and again and so on and so forth.
It's just speculative it has no real function other than drug markets, Maybe the only legitimate use it has is a faster way to transfer money overseas but even then you have to deal with exchanges to covert it back to fiat so you can actually spend it.
Not to mention when you sell the bitcoins for cash on the exchanges that counts as a capital gain and thus it's taxable so that's something to keep in mind as well.

Bury it for the pump dig it back up before the dump.
The pumpers usually get out while the pump is still happening though so by the time you start to see the price slide it will be too late.

I have been tinkering with bitcoin since 2011, It has only ever been marginally stable for a few months at a time, Since 2012 i would say it has been mostly unstable at least 90% of the year.
It's just a speculation game, It's so volatile it should be a game in a Las Vegas casino, They should put a Bitcoin terminal next to the black jack tables.

It will always be volatile man, It's treated more like a stock than a currency.

So what? The price of bitcoin fluctuates so much by the time you make it back to the check out counter with your goods the price of bitcoin could have lost half it's value.
I'm not saying it's worthless, The illegal drug markets and peoples need to move money around anonymously will keep it worth at least something forever probably, I'm just saying it can't function like USD because of the volatility.
