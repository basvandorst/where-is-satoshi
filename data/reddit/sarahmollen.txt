Right?  I don't get it.  I know people that have used BitInstant a couple times before without issue.  Then, the minute I try it out, I get the cold shoulder and lose my monies.  Money doesn't come easy now adays, especially for me.  This really blows and I'm frustrated as hell because this company won't do business the right way.  I feel like I can go on and on about how I feel about BitInstant.  I don't think it's doing me any good, though.  I'll just keep spreading the word so that I can do other people some good.  Facebook is next!

I'm coming to Reddit for help with my money to bitcoin transfer.  I transferred funds successfully on 6-16-2013, but BitInstant has failed to put them in my wallet.  I've tried over and over to contact Bitinstant about this issue.  I already tried customer support.  I have a ticket made out already, but I still haven't received any updates on the issue at all.  My bf had the same problem on the same day, but he got help the very next day.  WHY AM I BEING PUT IN THE BACKBURNER?  Is there any way you (bitinstant) can hurry my ticket along and personally take care of this immediately?  Bitcoin prices are going up and I'm losing money by the minute.

I'm not at all surprised to read that.  What a shame.  I knew this is what it came down to when they gave my bf his bitcoins after he complained on reddit.  that's what I'm trying to do now.  Maybe we can get their attention if enough people complain about them on this thread.  :-/ I really need that money refunded or get the bitcoins I paid for.  They have a poor business model if they think their company will last in the long run by scamming innocent people.

It has not been resolved.  I can't seem to get a response from them unless it's an automatic one telling me that a support ticket has been made and I'll be contacted shortly.  Apparently, there are quite a few unhappy people right now that are going through what I'm going through.  I continue to check my deposit address/ wallet every hour or so hoping my bitcoins will magically appear.  It's extremely disappointing when I find out nothing has been done. I feel like I've been scammed.
