So why do we need it? Raising the Block size limit is infinitely easier.
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:07:37
I don't really agree with you since by the time the blocks get that big , processing power will have also improved and storage cost decreased and I believe it will reach an equilibrium.

Nothing is certain, the world could end tomorrow but prediction based on past historical data is better than standing around doing nothing with our hands behind our backs. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:59:06
If it stops increasing then miners wouldn't mine bigger blocks since they can't propagate them and risk getting their blocks orphaned. So raising the limit is a non-issue.

I understand your point but that is with uncontrolled deflation. The interest I'll ask for is exactly how much I expect to make from this loan which in case of deflation (the interest) would be much lower. However it would be the governments job to keep deflation under control in order for banks to actually finding it beneficial to give loans while not crippling people taking these loans.

Maybe, maybe not. The point is to let the free market make the decision instead of imposing an artificial cap on the network. If off-chain solutions are as good as they claim to be let them prove them selves without crippling the bitcoin's on-chain capacity.

How you implement it? Here you go :
@_date: 2016-03-07 13:04:01
Please, work on all the off-chain solutions you want, just please don't cripple growth of the block-chain prematurely. We can afford to raise the block size to 2MB (even more than that). When your favorite off-chain solution comes along if its good enough people will use it of their own will. It is dishonest to  force people to use off-chain solution because you made a decision to artificially limit growth of the block-chain.

You do know what Roger said is non-binding, right? It will probably happen in the 75-80% range. Most probably just after a difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:01:01
If a fork happens at difficulty adjustment then the original chain will have 2 months of 1 block every 40 minutes , driving the fees through the roof . Honestly, how can it survive? No sane user would stay unless they are doing it out of spite, which is stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:08:05
I suggest waiting till they announce what is the actual plan for the hard-fork. It won't be a sudden fork and most likely with a pretty high percentage of Hash-rate.
All the miners moving to BU aren't trying to fork as soon as they achieve %51, it is simply so they have compatible clients to run on a fork as soon as the fork is agreed upon.
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:00:12
Grow up.
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:24:54

Who are they? Roger is just one person with his own opinions. What he said isn't set in stone, it is open for debate. As I said, I assume no one will attempt a fork (even Roger) before %75-80 of the hashrate is on board.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:57:16
No, Unlimited doesn't have a CEO since it is not a business. It is an open source project, its lead dev and maintainer right now is Andrew Stone.

@_date: 2016-01-28 17:29:45
What did you expect?
@_date: 2016-06-15 11:58:03
No, fee isn't the problem, the limited capacity is the problem. Raising the fees indefinitely isn't a magical solution for scaling bitcoin , raising the block size limit is . An adaptive limit would be even better or even no limit at all, let the miners and nodes individually decide on what limit is agreeable to them. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:48:53
FYI , this can still change, it is not over yet. Classic has an expiration date of January 1, 2018, if by then it hasn't achieved its threshold then it has failed.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:39:12
No time to explain, see you at the moon!
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:40:41
By signaled I mean when it reaches its activation threshold (classic hasn't achieved that). In classic's case its 750 of the last 1000 blocks. After that the network will have a grace period (could be weeks or months or longer) before the effects of the hard-fork kick in.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:24:06


Maybe that is true in the future, but for now isn't the block reward more than enough to compensate the miners for their work?
@_date: 2017-01-31 14:12:07
No, this was an issue in their setup not with BU. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:36:26
You can signal the hardfork months before it actually activates to give the network time to prepare, afterwards anyone who hasn't upgraded has only themselves to blame.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:21:24

They want scaling but not necessarily what Core has to offer.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:00:12
So I guess my question is why do you believe that the transition to fees should happen now and not wait till block rewards are getting low enough for mining to not be profitable without fees. Wouldn't delaying the transition allow us to on-board more users so that the system (and fees) can be more stable in the future?
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:40:20
It doesn't matter, he is not in control. The actual percentage at which the fork will happen will be decided among the miners/users/exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:45:20
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought miners migrated to the other chain simply because it was profitable (a combination of low difficulty and its price) and not because they were mining BTC at a loss or low fees  on BTC. I'm not disagreeing with you that at some point fees alone would have to compensate the miners but right now if the fees were low the miners would still profit off of block rewards alone.   
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:43:42


I don't know, I would say constantly full blocks is a very clear signal that a larger block size is needed ASAP.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:36:20
I'm not going to argue what fees bitcoin should have. Large scale systems shouldn't be running at full capacity near constantly we should give ourselves some room to handle cases of high demand which is clearly what we have now. For now I'd say 8 to 16 MB is an acceptable limit with very limited harm to decentralization. Any higher increase would need further research. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:55:49
The slippery slope fallacy won't help you in this case. Any increase beyond 4MB will need to be researched and studied, if its bad it won't be adopted.
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:21:38
Well. if its facts you seek , here is one: you can push the limit to 4MB without much effect on the network. This may seem "bad" to you but there a lot of people that see this as "good" and you need to compromise with them if you really want to build a consensus instead of "my way or the highway" approach that core is following. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 10:48:47
Doesn't matter, its **literally** terrorism!
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:33:41
I'm not part of any organization, I'm but a lowly hodler. However I'm of the belief that miners wouldn't shoot their selves in the foot, If they do an uncoordinated fork they risk lose money. I have no proof that they wouldn't act maliciously, however it is seriously against their interests to attack the network and produce coins of no value to anybody.
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:59:47

No, its proposing an upgrade that isn't backwards compatible but won't take effect till a majority supports it in order to insure a smooth transition without breaking usage of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:41:49
Those are specially crafted transactions on testnet. What can be expected realistically is 1.7 MB if current transactions trend continues . Stop spreading misinformation
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:36:03
That is debatable. Bitcoin is whatever the majority (hashrate + users + businesses) says it is. Would you say that bitcoin after the introduction of the 1MB is no longer bitcoin? of course you wouldn't.
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:02:37
Maybe. But its a far cry from 3.7 Mb. Its not going to happen in any reasonable scenario.
@_date: 2017-08-08 14:07:21
1- We are no where near that number of users.
2- Obviously we can't support this number of users OnChain right now. However, till offchain solutions start taking the load off of the blockchain we can safely increase the block size moderately to allow more users than the current capacity with a negligible risk of centralization.

The paper seems to suggest %10 with 4MB blocks. I'd say its a good tradeoff

And those pools wouldn't join if they couldn't sell their coins on major exchanges for a good profit. Thats why it wouldn't happen without a coordinated economical majority behind the fork.
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:18:07
Are you seriously asking why they aren't forking right away? The answer is obvious ,its because BU wants to be bitcoin with the economic majority behind it not an altcoin with a smaller hash-rate where the network effect would be against them. Not forking without a majority of the hashrate is the better path for BU.

That was for an extreme case of the protocol failing. What we're talking here is a political vote on the future of bitcoin. You can't realistically expect a unanimous vote here even if the idea is widely popular.

The HF has been debated for years to the point where any attempt to reach consensus has been an exercise in futility, meanwhile we have repeatedly hit the 1M cap and fees skyrocketed. I just feel we should just do the HF and relief the congestion till LN becomes operational.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:31:01
something something correlation and causation.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:07:05
Maybe my voice alone doesn't matter, but I would imagine at that point only an extreme minority would run his proposal as most big blockers wouldn't support it either.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:39:54


@_date: 2017-10-01 15:14:41
Doesn't matter what Jihan wants. We big blockers are not sheep, for the moment I agree with him the we should do a HF blocksize increase soon, but if he comes up with a proposal for lifting the 21M cap I would be against it and never support it.
@_date: 2016-10-06 09:17:44
So stop doing it. Lightning network isn't in conflict with raising the blocksize limit (or rather eliminating it altogether ).
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:10:05
The thing is that 2MB (BIP 109) was already a compromise. Big blockers want a permanent solution to the blocksize issue  ASAP but offered 2MB as a compromise to core. But I agree maybe we can try to find another middleground and try to get segwit in along with a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-10-06 09:20:06
Or stall for years and do nothing and still complain that the guys who actually want to do something are moving too fast. /s
@_date: 2016-10-06 09:23:29
Is everybody who thinks that on-chain scaling should come first are incapable of thinking for them selves? This is beyond absurd.
@_date: 2016-10-06 11:53:26
Ok, should we also limit the number of emails a person can send because otherwise you'll get more spam emails? Any other genius ideas? 
Of course there would be more spam but at the same you could also handle more legitimate users and miners can set their own policy on how to filter spam transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:44:58
No, I'm quite sure I'm capable thinking. Yet I still think on-chain should come first since second layer is no where near ready while on chain can be done safely right now. Segwit and schnorr and and whatever else to come are welcome addition that can come at anytime regardless of the blocksize limit, so stop stalling the limit increase for bullshit reasons. 


Wow , such shortsighted way to look at things. Its not as if the network is growing and the fees remain stable. It means people aren't willing to pay more and moving on to other altcoins. 
Never mind me, keep stalling and hope that blockstream will save the day
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:22:36
I don't mind if it is blocked. With that said, it is by far not that important and pressing issue. We can get to it in time after we have solved the blocksize limit issue. It has to be solved soon, the median fee is already over $1.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:15:54
Seriously, Asicboost not a big deal. Stop making a mountain out of a molehill. Asicboost is by far not the most pressing issue.

nitpicking much? you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:28:27
Supposedly in August. But I'm doubtful it will succeed since most miners (%80) and bitcoin companies support the compromise that was announced a few days ago instead, which entails activating SegWit and then activating a 2MB hardfork 6 months later.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:07:16
All you posted is just a proof of concept. LN isn't a universal replacement for on-chain transactions yet. Otherwise we wouldn't see the huge backlog we have now. Stop being obtuse. How many wallets , exchanges, merchants, payment processors accept LN payments right now?
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:49:47
Rush what? A block size limit has been researched , developed and tested thoroughly. All that remains is for miners to run the code.
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:13:45


Which pools, the ones blocking SegWit, or the ones blocking a blocksize limit increase? Both are at fault IMO.

@_date: 2017-05-12 17:25:07
It seems like everything in bitcoin has become contentious. I honestly think we should suck it up and increase the blocksize limit and accommodate the growth in the user-base till layer 2 solutions are ready (and I emphasize the word ready) to take the load off of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:10:10
No, it's not. There are more than one proposal at play, only the segwit proposal is affected by it. A straight forward blocksize limit increase isn't affected by asicboost.

There is a feature developed by the Core team called SegWit. It is basically a new transaction format that solves an issue called "transaction malleability" and provides a modest increase in transaction throughput. Deploying this feature required a %95 support from the miners. However, most miners are reluctant or outright against activating SegWit since they see it as not good enough to handle the transaction pressure on the bitcoin network. So, some users and devs started pushing for UASF (User activated soft fork) which aims to force the activation SegWit with or without miner support by marking blocks that don't support SegWit as invalid.

@_date: 2017-07-10 19:08:58
It seems that it works as intended. As far as I understand (which could be wrong) the blocks on the triggered fork are waiting for a &gt;1 MB block so the fork is guaranteed. The &gt;1MB is required just once on the HF threshold to guarantee that the fork happened ,it can be filled with NOP if no backlog exists on HF date, while the chain that doesn't observe the HF continued on a separate path and didn't care about (or want ) a &gt;1MB block.

@_date: 2017-05-13 12:09:36
Yes I'm serious. How many transactions a day does LN handle right now? How many wallets support it? Can I use it to right now to make most of my bitcoin payments instead of onchain?  The answer is no. No need to be rude.

Hijack what exactly? Core doesn't have a god given right to be the only group of people who decide the bitcoin rules. Most of the network users , miners and merchants have agreed that for now they will run the btc1 project instead of Core, though that may change in the future.

If you're holding on XAPO then your bitcoin will be on whatever fork XAPO follows. However if you move have your bitcoin to your wallet (private keys that you control )
before the fork  then your coins would be available on both forks.

It is not an "expectation", the hardfork **will** happen 3 months after segwit activates.

No, it did not freeze over, Bitmain has been vilified endlessly on this sub while their position has always been clear that SegWit by itself isn't sufficient as a scaling solution. And now that they know that a 2MB HF is on the way 3 months after segwit they will be activating segwit.
