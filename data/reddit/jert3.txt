Does it matter?  The official narrative on bitcoin is set with little adherence to reality. And know way of knowing why they actually want it banned, we can only guess.
It is high-time to dispel the notion that most policy is set a according to reality and/or with the general interests of the public even entering the equation. Most policy is set to create, maintain or strengthen power and or resources (money generally). Foolhardy to beleive the propaganda.

Agreed, was going to post the same thing.
1 billion dollars is nothing in the global funny-money created-out-of-thin-air world supply of bucks,
70m is a sizeable percentage/chunk of the total bitcoin supply. And bitcoin takes a lot of energy to produce, its not created by a private company lending the government a bond or whatever else nonsense.

At least you didn't hear about bitcoin really, really early and CPU mine it making some BTC in a day and deciding that it wasn't worth it to keep your computer going mining this pennies currency all day when you could be gaming.  Sigh. 
I think I mined for 1.5 days or so. 
And then a few years later, 'Wow bitcoin is worth 15$ a coin! And I have all these video cards and spare PCs lying around ! Hmm maybe I should mine -- a fuck it, even at 15$ a coin I'd still only make a couple bucks profit a month 8(  ' 
And of course my shock when BTC went over $200 USD and clearly thinking at the time: holy crap, that's nuts how well it did. I don't think it'll ever go as high as $200 again...' 
Ya that's BTC .  I love it.

Dude bitcoin is at 9300 usd.  12% in a day.  The sky is not falling. Bitcoin has had countless days that it's gained or lost $1500 bucks.

You can buy stuff with BTC . Lots and lots of stuff. 
But I think that most people out there, definitely myself included, hate spending BTC because it feels like I'm losing out in potential investment gains.  I'm happy to spend funny-fiat on a hundred dollar pair of shades for example, that money is only going to be worth less next year.  And it's the opposite and then some for BTC. 
BTC naturally developed into the sort of 'gold standard of crypto' as it has.  If it turns out that ya, maybe BTC just isn't that great for buying milk and batteries and what not, because it became something even greater than that, than that's okay.

Many many folks in similar boat! My sob story is that I both mined btc backing in the CPU only days and stopped after 2 weeks seeing that the 'few' bitcoin I collected wouldn't be worth anything in all likelihood down the road.   Second sob story bought about 20 btc at $15 bucks then sold most of it around $200 thinking it'd never get that high again. 
Ah well, can only be so bitter though, made fine earnings and the technology is seriously world changing IMHO, very happy to support anything that goes against the banking monopoly on currency.

It is incredible how few mainstream media sites got the Eth story correct. 
ETH behaved exactly as it was programmed. It wasn't a hack. It was a 'confidence hack' I guess, if anything. And it was DAO. The 'hack' was totally predicted a few weeks earlier by that guy who posted the major security concerns (/ failures) of DAO.  
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:59:48
That's the really funny and obvious thing I don't get about 'what they should do about DAO'  (forks etc). The whole purpose of DAO (I thought) was that users / owners of coins can vote on proposals (which was how the money was moved). 
Never thought DAO was a good idea. The programming is fine its just you can't put trust in over 90, 99% of the users using it not to abuse it. If abuse is possible, it will happen, that's why bitcoin is such a great design, it doesn't allow for abuse (well, makes it very difficult I should say).

Inflation has uses, lets not be obtuse. 
The reason why we are going to negative interest is to encourage companies to spend money instead of hoarding all the wealth.
Our present financial system is ridiculois and illogical compared to bitcoin imho but its much more nuanced than ‘inflation is bad’.
Inflation is bad and good. One bad thing is saving a currency for retirement that is worth 5% in actual buying power is problematic. One good thing is for all the heavily indebted countries in the wod (ie most of them) their debt goes down in real buying power, translating into untild billions saved. Anyways, this is a really complicated topic, the more you can learn (in any subject) the more you’ll understand it of course.

Yup, amazing isn't it. 
And this fact always make me giggle when I see news stories from the mainstream press about how 'bitcoin is down 20%' or 'bitcoin down 70% last three months' or similar, over the years. 
Like ya bitcoin went down 10% bucks today against fiat currencies but you didn't mention how it's up 234124144% since being created.  It's a good example of how framing plays such a big part in news stories. You can make a news story about the same thing prove whatever you want to if you have a bias

Answer is yes.  Buy as much as you can afford.  You can be certain that whatever price you'll buy it, you'll be able to sell it at profit down the road.  It's only matter of if that'll be soon (months) or (years). 
Ya sure investing in bitcoin is a gamble.  But it's one of the best odds you'll ever have, and life's a gamble. You won't get anywhere with the money sitting in your bank account for near negative interest rates.

I believe this is incorrect. Halving doesn’t affect difficulty, just reward reduction. It’s only going to take more and more power. 
Personally I don’t agree with the power issue being a negative for bitcoin as much. My opinion being that in our global economic captitakist system, as waste and pollution isn’t really factored into our calculations and metrics. Ie fracking for oil is enormously wasteful, and then transporting the oil around in trucks is also terrible (as we do we’re I’m at in Canada). But if your costs are a dollar less than profits than this is seem as a valid exercise in wealth generation. 
Anyways for those want to reduce waste energy, then support PoS coins, or hybrid models, such as Ethereum will switch to.

Ya, agreed. I guess maybe it just comes with experience. I’ve been trading bitcoin since it was less than 50 a coin, so having done it for so long, now even a day drop or gain of 1000 isn’t going to phase me. I used to get excited to make a few hundred bucks off of trades over 10 bitcoin. Spolied newcomers complaining of a ‘low price’ of 8000 usd or whatever just makes me laugh.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:18:05
That’s a common idea and fair enough.
I’d counter though that bitcoin has actual value. The value is inherient in its superior
 method of transference. You can not really actually transfer fiat digitally. It’s not possible. What actually happens is a series of credits and debits with each participant company / service taking a cut, when pre internet fiat money is transferred digitally as it’s natural element.
Additionally, as fiat can be printed at whim, it represents money and value, compared to the value of bitcoin, bitcoin is not debt, and it has value, and value is again inherient to it (and not a representation of value) by the fact you can not counterfeit cryptocurrency. 
The impossiblility of counterfeit and the public ledger may sound like a small thing but its not. Most fiat doesn’t actually exist in bills, only a very small percentage of it is actual; fiat is mostly representative of value on the macro level whereas Bitcoin is true digital value and this makes it more viable than modern fiat currency which represents debt, manipulated in a logically ridiculous ledger system.
I think any alien or truly objective person who would compare fiat and bitcoin would say that of the two, fiat is funny money. But it is complicated. Even I have trouble describing how bitcoin to non tech folks or most legacy- financial minded folks, and I know the subject quite well.

I don't recommend this for bitcoin because the hashing pool is the biggest by a long shot and your rasperry pi would be less than one in 100 billionth percent of hashing power.
I recommend doing the same thing but just big a small cap alt coin , preferably one of the few that is cpu only. It's not going to amount to much in terms of hashing or coin generation for you but it does help out the network and at worst would be a neat learning experience.

Thanks for your great comments. 
Just wanted to add 2 cents of history lessons for those who weren't aware. 
Federal Reserve was a private company created in a year and a bit before World War 1, to extend control over money by the government in partnership with the banking cartels and rich elite of the day.
 
For a long time, the U.S dollar was pegged to gold.  After the Great Depression, and seeing how funny-money fiat flooded the stock market to ridiculous levels (for the time), the general public loved collecting gold. They realized it was better to hold gold that funny money fiat or stocks. 
This was causing very real problems for the US economy. So what was the plan?  
Confiscate all gold from all American citizens.  The government set a rate of $20.67 per ounce (1933).  You had to turn it in or you'd be arrested or fined. It became illegal to have a nugget or bar of gold at home.  
After confiscating all Americans' gold, the government raised the price a year later to 35$ ounce.  You do the math, see how much funny money was created with that move (69%). 
This price stayed the same for gold (pegged) until 1971.  Of course, as fiat currencies historically always do, it lost a vast amount of its value in this span of time. 
1971 Nixon removed the gold standard, the gov' no longer controlled gold prices, removed any links for the dollar to gold it once had, and it was legal to own gold again.  In the 48 years since, gold went from $35 and ounce to $1445 an ounce.  
Just stuff to keep in mind.  Fiat is absolutely doomed to be worth ever-less, hardly anything could possibly change this. It's printed endlessly, it's not pegged to anything, and the private company that prints the American dollar makes immediate dividends of 6% on every dollar (or 100 billion dollars) they print, let that sink in, a private organization of ultra rich make money literally printing money... how does this fiat stuff work again?
Comparing a limitless, unpegged fiat currency that is printed up by the hundreds of billions versus a limited supply of 21million superior currency units. It's the simplest thing to see how BTC will do against fiat currency as a whole. 
Also keep in my bitcoin is the first international, digital world wide currency not linked to a nation state. 
Bottom line is fiat is for spending as quickly as possible into assets that go up in value instead of down.  Simple as that.
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:35:41
Right on man.  
You have good mindset and it was terrific gamble to take 3 years back.  If I did the same thing I think I'd be more upset about only coming away with 37k but that is the wrong way to look at , looking at as you have that you quadrupled your money is a better way to go.  That's fucking way more than you'd ever get with the money in a bank savings account, that's for sure.

Strong leaders with plans for improving their country motivate through explaining and illustrating positive changes in governance and society.
Strong leaders who intend to improve society are much rare than your average self interested politician.
These more common, self interested leaders motivate people to vote for them through rhetoric based on hate and fear of ‘the other.’ 
It’s easier to rile up the general masses to your cause through the use of fear and hate than it is to motivate with equality and justice. This goes back to the psychological history of man where war and conflict were much more common.
The majority of economicly powerful  will lend their support in leaders that maintain the imbalance of wealth in the society, thus, in a complicated system, will sooner support the hateful cruel leader that has control over a leader attempting to change towards a more equitable society.
 Unfortunately a large percentage of society gets successfully trained to not question their leadership or give it much consideration beyond base impulses, such as blaming immigrants for the wealth gap and other common, propaganda fueled beliefs. This is also the case as the disenfranchised masses of society do not have the financial means to engage with the political class in many modern societies where most of the population lives pay cheque to pay cheque (due to the inequality and wealth gap... see where this is going?)

Related side note, out if curiousity checked the mining returns for the new 54 TH ant miner (which was 3000 usd or so). It was hard to believe how little btc you can mine with 50 th.  
If you have a good video card would recommend looking into mining alts for fun and to warm your house in the winter. But from $$ perspective going forward it will pretty much always be a better investment to mine than buy, and its certainly a lot less work.

There are some very serious and unavoidable problems in our global financial system. Fundamentally, its broken.
Another aspect here is emergency use only tools have been used in non emergency times to postpone a natural recession from happening, which in turn makes it, when it does finally happen, far worse and harder to mitigate. There is very little chance of avoiding a massive economic collapse and depression now, its just a matter of when.

Man, its really complicated and sort of odd how the Federal Reserve works.  You probably know its a private company right? You probably also know that all USD are notes of debt, technically.
I recommend a solid hour reading up online on the federal reserve. I think it’s an eye opener for anyone.
One fun fact that not many ppl know is that the Federal Reserve generates a profit of a few percentage points off of EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR they print and create by issuing and moving debts around to produce USD. 
They print 50 billion, instant ‘dividend’of 5% think it was. It’s amazing (in a bad way).

b)  not everyone works at CERN or gets brain surgery had everyone is affected and involved in the global financial system. 
c) your counter point here would be that we shouldn't discuss finance because we aren't experts?  But people are being taken advantage of here, so what are you saying, they should take it and not get at least marginally informed on the topic? 
Going back to your brain or particle accelerator, also like those things you don't have to be genius in the topic to figure out if they work or not, or if they are ripping you off or not, or if they are built upon flawed reasoning and failed systems.

Important to remember that a private company creates the American dollar, the one world global currency standard, and for every million they print, they make a percentage of profit. 
For creating money out of thin air they get, in return, money which can be used to get anything they want on the planet.  That does not compute. It's hard to find out who even controls the money supply and makes these dividends and the amount of power they have is unfathomable, think about it.

I think something really unnoticed here is how the DAO ICO and open of trading has affected BTC price. Because of the unbalanced tiers of DAO's ICO, and the fact that it is price-tied to ETH, people are fleeing ETH into BTC to protect their assets, and with the halving a month away, it's just a recipe for a boom.  And the boom encourages even more people to sell ETH  (as the price drops) and put it back into BTC.

Ya I really have no right to complain about making it a profit (but just not as a big of one as I'd hope) hehe.

Ya headline is clickbait, sure. 
But the fact of the matter is that fiat is printed in near unlimited quantities made out of thin air, whereas bitcoin has a finite amount of increasingly difficult to generate coins.  It's completely expected, as has been the case with all fiat monetary systems since the dawn of time that the true purchasing power will eventually inflate to hardly anything.  This is even the case with the hegemonic USD, which is backed by massive military might, just through regular fiat inflation the buying power of 1 dollar is massively reduced over the last 100 years. This is just par for the course for funny money fiat.

You may be right but just want to add my 2 cents that each and every of the 5 or 6 crypto booms that I've been in (originally bought btc at 15 bucks lol), each time, most people will say similar things along the lines that 'this time it is different' and 'it will never crash again' and 'the 6th boom is different than the last 5' even when all the evidence is to the contrary (that after a boom there is a new ATH and a crash of ~80% afterwards).

Ya just stupid forks mainly designed to leech money out of bitcoin and into the creator's / copy-cat's pockets.
You can't really call them scams, that's not totally fair.  But you could say they are about as useful as the next 1000 alt coins that don't really do anything besides serve as speculative assets.

Crap. Few days ago was thinking 435 was the best price we'd see for bitcoin for a long time to come. And I still think that's true, but I sold at 455 :_( 
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:16:21
Yes, something to be concerned of.  But more so just something to be aware of.  It's the nature of BTC to have these completely wild swings in value (compared to any traditional asset or fake money/fiat).


Ya, that's what trading is all about :)  .  Picking a good time to get in and a good time to get out are both important.   
For example someone have had 5 BTC in 2015.  Yet if they never cashed out at all, they would have had far less if they (succesfully, it's not easy) predicted that the market top was 20,000 and sold all there BTC then, then rebought at 3500, they would have made massive gains. 
For my own portfolio, I sold about 2/5ths two weeks ago because I placed my bets so to speak, on a retraction / correction bringing BTC down to around 7500 where upon I will rebuy more coins and collect a measure of fiat profit.
A common strategy for example, is if your portiflio doubles ,to sell half of it at that point, then the remaining half would be pure profit and you'd be protected (in the sense of not losing any of your original investment) if there were to be a massive crash (which happens with BTC) and likewise if it sky rocketed from there, you'd still be able do very well profit wise.
@_date: 2019-05-29 19:25:12
I sold about 2/5ths.  
Why?  I'm hoping / betting on the price going back down to mid or high 7000s upon which point I'd buy more. 
Why do I think this may happen? Bitcoin usually does the opposite of what I logically think it will do 8)   everyone's feeling bullish and the indicators are mostly good so that's why I think it'll go in the opposite direction. 
Hindsight is 20/20 right.  In the last boom, no doubt many, many people rode there bitcoin portoflio when it went up 300% or 500% or whatever, but thought it would never go down much so never sold, ending up never actually seeing any the profit at all, in fiat, as it went from 6k to 20k and back to down to ~6k. 
It's completely understandable for someone to sell to fiat at this point. It will only be in hindsight whether that was a good move or not, which everyone tries to predict but ultimately anything could happen.

What a fantastic idea, makes a lot of sense.  Also could be tied into how (as you mention) home miners would often heat there homes in the winter with mining gear, adding to efficiency that way. 
Good luck with your endeavour.

No problem. 
Your amount of crypto, BTC, XMR, whatever, will not be changed. Actually it's a strength of the software that this is a fact.  If you have 1 btc in your exchange account it will not change from anything other than 1 btc irregardless of the fiat price at any given time. 
Also, if you own your wallet (as you should), and control the keys, there isn't anything in the world that could be done to take that from you, VISA or the US gov could not if they wanted
[ of course, I mean through the software, I'm not including the fact of 10 guys robbing you at gun point and forcing you to hand over your private keys.  Technically there is no way for anyone to take your crypto from your wallet,  unlike say cash in bank account, which can be closed at the whim of your bank without much recourse, such as what happened in Greece  ]
Fiat money is literally a note of debt owning to you.  These amounts are represented by numbers in databanks but don't actually correspond to any physical or actual wealth, they represent debt technically speaking.  Whereas crypto, you are in control of your own funds and the software is the arbitrator, not a banker or government.

Lol this is so dumb and amusing. 
It's amazing how selective people are picking out the 1 predictions this 'time traveller' got right with the bitcoin price vs all the now proven falsities of the rest of his claim.

Thanks for mentioning this. 
The anti-boomer sentiment seems popular on Reddit these days.  I find it logically ridiculous to lump the biggest generation on the planet into one cohesive group that seemingly is the cause of all troubles according to some on Reddit.  That doesn't make any sense.  As with every generation since humanity started, there are good and bad people.  You can't make useful generalizations of behaviour when you are talking about groups composed of billions of ppl. 
What many folks (younger particularly) should be mad about is the wage gap between the 99% and the 1%, that has grown massively since WW2.  It's not the boomers that are holding Millenials down, it's our exploitive economic system that squeezed all the wealth over most of the 20th century in increasingly fewer and fewer hands.

Because of many governments artificially pumping the stock market up to as of yet unseen levels, this making the next crash all the worse, effectively kicking the can down the road for future offices and folks to deal with. 
The next big crash is going to be a doozy.  Much of financial markets are pure imagination. manipulation and confidence.  Banks are leveraged by 1000 of times.  
It wouldn't take much of a real shock to completely crash the world economy -- as would be healthy, as crashes are inherent part of our capitalist engines -- but because this has been artificially put off (to make politicians look good partly), the next crash is going to be a massive, massive one, perhaps devastating moreso than 2008. We are way over due at this point for a crash, there has never been a bull market like this before (artificially pumped up by massive cash injections, ultra low interest rates, ridiculous and illogical financial instruments such as some derivatives based on debt etc)

Hi dude . 
The price that you purchased the bitcoin at is set at the time of purchase, not at the time that the bitcoin arrives into your wallet.  (6 hours seems pretty long for this btw, usually you'd be looking at something closer to 30 minutes). 
If you bought 1 btc at 8500, you now have 1 btc, and 0 dollars.  If you sold at the price 6 hours later of 8700 per US, then you'd have 8700 USD and 0 bitcoin, if you sold it next year at 250000 USD, then you'd have 250000 USD and 0 bitcoin.  BTC is it's own value so it doesn't equate to any fiat at at all really, unless you converted it / sold it to fiat.  
Just one more thing to consider, for most exchanges, 'stable coins' , namely Tether are used, which is a crypto that is pegged to the US dollar.  Something to keep in mind.
