Just remember Bitcoin can be part of your portfolio but you should spread your investments to mitigate risk.

Nah big investments are fine as long as what youre buying is an asset and not a digital dream with bi-polar disorder.

It's a fucking digital currency a bit on a hard drive not something sentimental.

That's gonna be a no for me dog. Not that I don't think bitcoin is not amazing, but you can't hack a gold bar.

I made a shitload on interest last year much more than 10% on a Vanguard plan. The point is keep saving money you earn, keep buying bitcoin and figure out how much risk you are willing to take. Take that other part and put it in an ETF. You still make great returns on BTC, and when you reinvest that entire amount you are still making profit and reinvesting what you have compounding it making you even more money.
BTC is volatile don't leave yourself high and dry if BTC decides to take a dump on you. Spread it out, but by all means keep a larger portion in BTC if you are early on in saving and investing. 
Now if you were like 10 years off from retirement, and you cashed out  to hop on the BTC bus you would be an idiot.

Compound interest is synergistic, gains grow exponentially as your assets increase. It is the most powerful force in Economics, and is why the wealthiest people in the world have the amount of money they do. 


Pooling all of your assets on one investment is not smart . Investing like that in anything can ruin someones life, and it will.

That sounds like a series of bad decisions. Had you left some in bitcoin some in stock it would have evened out. I'm saying spread it out, if you put 15 in stocks and bonds, the other 25 in bitcoin you would still have money if BTC crashed, and would have made a profit.

You all need lessons in investing 101, have a diversified portfolio. You're dumping all of your eggs into a basket that is on fire.

I'm not saying don't invest in winners. Invest in winners **AND** take chances when you're young. You decide what your spread will be, just don't bet it all on one horse.  
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:54:38
And eventually, you will be wrong. If not in bitcoin in another investment.

Everyone made a sizeable chunk of short term cash. This is an investment strategy aiming at making money off of compound interest, which will always make you more money than mining hardware, and carries less risk than day trading BTC. No serious investor keeps all of their assets tied up in one kind of asset whether that be stocks, bonds or Bitcoin. It's a fact that the market will crash at some point. You can mitigate losses and maximize returns by following traditional investment wisdom that has worked for the past 100 years.
