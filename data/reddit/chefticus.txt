Yup, started buying in December in what seemed to be a dip, but turned out to be a tiny one in a massive bull run... not selling out but hard to look at the positive side at the moment , as there has not been one ... still, only a month in!

I may be naive but I think regulation would mostly be applied to exchanges in the uk, owners would probably have to declare their holdings and be legally obliged to pay some sort of capital gains tax but this would be much better for bitcoiners in the uk than an outright ban, which would be unworkable anyway. Governments want only two things, control and taxes!

Hi this was the article (it was actually about a Trezor), very well written piece, no idea If it is the real deal or not and if it was the thieves would need the hardware in order to do so. Still, makes you think!

I don’t really understand the whole concept - why would a company that has the equipment to mine allow you to rent a setup when it would be more profitable for them just to mine themselves? In my experience if someone asks you for funds up front and it seems to be to good to be true, it usually is.

This will probably get down voted, personally I am more pro bch than btc, but I agree that btc is bitcoin and bch is bitcoin cash. To me bch is not ‘ the real bitcoin’, it’s better, an upgrade, due to lower fees, higher usability and less waiting time between transactions during busy periods.  And on-chain scaling is a massive plus. I don’t have any faith in lightning at all, I feel it’s just a patch for a coin that can’t handle significant volume.  
I think to call bch the real bitcoin confuses newcomers and does bch a miss service. 
However, r/btc will always be home to bch supporters. 
It’s just part of the cultural history of the development of crypto currencies. 
Newcomers are soon set straight its pro bch. And unlike r/bitcoin , discussion is open to other coins. Not necessarily favoured, but not censored.
There is nothing wrong with being pro bitcoin, it’s all just personal preference.

You might be right, but if you have looked into crypto history before you are no doubt aware the   Up to 90% drops are part of the crypto cycle and have happened four times already in its history. This is nothing new. If your worried, sell at a massive loss. If you have followed popular opinion and have not invested more than you can afford to loose, sit it out. Every single time this has happened in the past there has been a recovery and new ath.

Whilst I was merely pointing out that a pyramid scheme is called that due to the shape of its organisational and reward structure, fuck it, I’ll bite :) fiat currency could be described as a pyramid scheme, as one percent of the population own the vast majority of it, and since moving away from the gold standard ( as the us didn’t have enough gold to actually cover the gold standard any more) it is just about as credible. We are lucky in the USA and uk , quantitive easing and hyperinflation hasn’t got to out of hand yet. Look at the poor Venezuelans!

@_date: 2018-02-07 19:33:05
Don’t put in  more than you can afford to lose, I disagree - don’t put in more than you WANT to lose, otherwise you are emotionally attached to the investment. Your emotions will tell you to do the exact opposite of what you should do. Buy the dips and sell the highs is counterintuitive to your emotions telling you to buy the ups and sell on the lows. If you can’t handle this- just hold ( I did not use hodl intentionally because true hodling is a ideological theoretical abstract many can not truly understand / comprehend). Holding is easier than using your own judgment ( which will likely be sullied by your own emotional attachment to fiat).
I use CAH money ( cocaine and hooker money ). I don’t use cocaine or hookers, but I use this to refer to bad habit money , such as money that would be spent on drinking, smoking ( if was still smoking) or generally spunking in a irresponsible manner, that way if cryptos go tits up ( and chances are they will not) I have still gained in health from not drinking and smoking, and if they come through... well hopefully I will do ok out of it.
Good luck and keep at it.

I cannot think of one revolution in the history of mankind where all parties won? There is always a winning side/s and a losing side/s.  And this revolution is far from silent. Also anyone can be involved if they live where it is legal, and their finances and access to technology allow it. Therefore not centralised. Despite your negative reaction, you are welcome to join. Or you could let your negativity leave you behind. It’s up to you.

You did.
‘A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.’
Whilst I personally am bullish as fuck, I don’t see bitcoin fitting this at all. 
There is still the chance of crypto being criminalised, 51% attacked and generally just not being adopted by the masses. 
As many people point out, it could go to zero. 
I don’t think it will, but it is best to stay pragmatic- long term or short term.

Actually stable coins will have a use until bitcoins price stabilises.

As far as I am aware as he has kept his funds in crypto he therefore does not have to pay tax on his trades.

True, or maybe, a great time to to get involved in an innovative technology in its infancy that could completely change the game. 
Chances like that only crop up a few times in a lifetime. 
For me, it would be irresponsible not to take a punt.

It gives me a chubby to...

Agreed, sooner or later the shorts will get blown out of the water just as hard as the bulls have in 2018, if not harder.

I love that this is working, someone should start a tipping Tuesday ...
@_date: 2018-12-23 12:07:47
Well, I can assure you my buddy didn’t see it as a joke and is as happy as a pig in shit. Sometimes the best incentive  to learn about something is to have some skin in the game ...

 I’m in the uk and use Coinbase for all my buying. Just make sure you remove any crypto as soon as you get it ( if you transfer to Coinbase pro there will be no withdrawal fees) and put it in a wallet you own the private keys for.

This is an interesting point, I have yet to hear of a hot wallet being compromised on an iOS device. I would love to be proved wrong though- has anyone lost funds on an iPhone / iPad excluding user error? 
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:25:22
Bitpay need to work on that logo!
