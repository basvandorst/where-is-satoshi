it was very strange that he then sprinkled a bit of crack on himself

Question, why did you lie to us
@_date: 2019-09-24 02:03:08
A product hyped for a year to have less than 1/10000 the rest of daily btc volume? How do you twist that into being amazing
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:50:36
So? It's about opportunity cost, you can DCA as much as you like but now you'll always be a multiplier of 20% less gain than me

Gamblers fallacy, the absolute dumbest reasoning for expecting a pump.
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:58:21
why r u being so defensive about the price? if you believe in it you wouldn't need to try so hard to keep the sentiment up
@_date: 2019-09-19 06:56:54
Keep that money aside as emergency savings, instead of listening to a rando on reddit telling you to gamble
@_date: 2019-09-25 05:30:22
9%? its almost down 20% on the week
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:40:51
You're not wrong, but different strokes for different folks. Some people make more actively trading, some people make more DCAing, but doesn't mean one of them is objectively better than the other

oh hey its mr "bitcoin will never go down again"
@_date: 2019-09-16 04:23:05
Because spewing facts he knows are false to impressionable young traders can screw them over. Look at the guys comments he told someone "At 21 you should be putting every dollar you can into Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin can't go down" and "Btc will never go below 10k again"
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:12:37
To dump it? No other reason
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:33:19
This didn't age well.
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:20:39
You couldve said the same thing about selling at 11k. why would you se at 11k when it was 12k? And look at the benefit you wouldve had selling there now
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:33:49
How many times is your long gonna be rekt until you learn, old man
@_date: 2019-09-21 12:45:21
this didnt age well
@_date: 2019-09-23 00:23:23
not your portfolios valuation after you kept telling people btc would never go below 10k as you leverage longed at 10400
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:37:49
Youve been wrong about every take quit while youre.. well youre not ahead but just quit

Thanos snapped and is halving the price

Statistically it's either me or you
@_date: 2019-09-24 00:12:49
"We WiLl nEver Go bELow 10K agaIN" You, literally yesterday and every day before that for weeks, dont listen to a word he says
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:15:29
His chart that he pulled out of his ass
@_date: 2019-09-24 13:06:08
I was looking at livecoinwatch
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:02:07
dont be sorry its all good
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:31:37
How do you feel about your comment now? "You're gonna sell it now that it's down ?" If someone didn't sell when he made that comment that's 10% of your entire portfolio valuation gone overnight
