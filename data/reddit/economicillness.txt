No, none. Try [disable WebRTC]( addon for Firefox &amp; retest.  You can't do it for chrome AFAIK.

Maybe stop trying to tell people how this tech was meant to be used.
Maybe it doesn't make much sense to sell something that's expected to increase in value against fiat by 25x in the next 700 days.
Maybe Bitcoin is way too volatile to be used as a medium of exchange until its volatility subsides
Maybe it's meant to act as a hedge against the legacy financial paradigm instead of becoming part of it.
Maybe all of the merchants that currently "accept" Bitcoin are just immediately selling it for fiat at the POS.

[Yes,]( since September 2014.  I've just checked my openVPN log and I am being assigned various ipv6 ip's.

This.  You get a 10% discount when paying with Bitcoin &amp; they support Bech32 addresses.

There's many eyes on the blockchain.  You would have heard about it by now if it had. If you run a full node you can obtain the current amount of Bitcoin in circulation with a simple command.

I'd definitely install [fail2ban](  I'm not sure if this is available for Windows (assuming you're using that) or what its equivalent would be.
Consider running your node on cheap, dedicated hardware such as a raspberry pi 4. I can highly recommend the [Raspiblitz]( project which has taken most, if not all (known) security concerns into consideration and has excellent support in their telegram channel.

How is this possible?  He has a long history of very bad decision making and appears to have a barely average IQ..

I've sent quite a few LN transactions with 0 fee.

Looking at the macro market trend and considering the S2F model, what makes you think that it won't?


I agree with that.  I've got buy orders at 5k right now.


Absolutely no chance in my opinion. You're saying that the halvenings will have 0 effect which is impossible if demand remains stagnent and even less likely if demand increases.

I agree on the LN but I'm sure they used P2SH addresses the last time I topped my VPN allowance up and that was just one month ago.  That's why I posted about Bech32 support to be honest.
I might fire over an email and make the suggestion about LN support.

We can audit the public blockchain and verify that this hasn't happened with 100% certainty.
