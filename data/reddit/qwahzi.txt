Throughput isn't all we care about, but if we want to see cryptocurrency actually being used on a global scale it has to be usable
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:50:39
C'mon man, don't bury your head in the sand on legitimate issues. $15 transaction fees and multi-hour wait times are not what most people would call usable. Especially with working alternatives that are free and have no wait times...

What about DAG-based coins like Rai and IOTA? 0 transaction fees, and 1000s of TPS. How can BTC compete with technology like that?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:52:23
RaiBlocks is the main one I know of right now - tested at 7000 TPS. IOTA once the coordinator issues are resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:09:38
My what? What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:27
Nice VFR! I wish Honda would update it to better compete with the new Ninja 1000s though
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:00:08
Yea, IOTA is having issues right now, but the path forward is visible and high numbers of transactions have at least been tested successfully.
There's still RaiBlocks though, which does instant transactions right now without any issues and has been tested at 7000 TPS.

What do you mean? Bitcoin news is posted on those subreddits all the time. A lot more than the memes posted here
@_date: 2019-11-17 20:49:19
Check out some of the other cryptocurrency subreddits like and @_date: 2018-10-15 14:58:50
This is pretty interesting, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:55:54
What about altcoins that can do all of those things (cheap, fast, and decentralized)? Especially (what I see as) next gen coins that use DAGs/Tangle instead of Blockchain? 
Imo, the only thing that Bitcoin really has right now is the first mover advantage. I struggle to think of one technical feature that Bitcoin does better than some of the alt coin options that are out there.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:09:51
Nano is both. The structure is a block-lattice DAG, but consensus is done through delegated Proof-of-Stake.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:26:44
Why would you put yourself through this when there are scalable alternatives? I used to love Bitcoin, but scalability is a huge issue. Why pay 2 cents and wait 7 hours when you can pay literally nothing and wait ~15 seconds?
@_date: 2019-01-27 03:35:14
Same reason I sold mine even though I've been into BTC since 2013. Bitcoin lost its focus.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:29:25
I think Bitcoin will always be around in some capacity due to it's proven security, brand name, and first mover advantage, but I also think that other currencies (feeless, scalable, near instant transactions) will eventually end up being used for the majority of real world transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:29:02
How do you suggest I update it? What words are you referring to?
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:57:49
I'm building a better BTC and Lightning comparison chart, but I wanted to make sure I got my facts straight. Here are the sources I have used so far:

They are locked up. You have to pre-fund the channel with some amount of BTC capacity in order to use Lightning: 


@_date: 2018-12-29 16:29:09
I'm really new to the Lightning network, so take this with a huge lump of salt. Here's my current understanding:
- Since nodes must be online all the time with autonomous access to unencrypted private keys, malware on your Lightning node could steal your funds
- Attackers could attempt to broadcast an old commitment transaction to the settlement layer (Bitcoin blockchain), but then you (the other party) would be allowed to take all of the Bitcoin in the channel with the revocation key
- Attackers (or a simple peer failure) could keep your funds locked up for days by simply not responding. You'd eventually get your BTC back, but you'd have to wait
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:28:09
Great site! Thank you for that link!
Good point on scalability, I'll update that. Power usage is difficult to determine because it hasn't really been studied yet.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:16:29
That's what I'm asking haha. Which of the information needs to be updated? It's surprisingly difficult to find sources that are up-to-date and accurate.
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:50:04
I'm trying to compare the functionality each system provides. Eventually I'll add other coins to the chart to expand the comparison.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:08:06
I'm not quite sure what you mean. Bitcoin is secured by Proof of Work - you'd have to have 51% of mining hashrate to create a double spend. The Lightning network is different because you have to monitor constantly for fraud (until the payment is settled).
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:56:41
Multisig, but lightning nodes require autonomous access to unencrypted private keys. I really don't have a good understanding of it yet though.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:52:22
What happens to transaction fees when we get near the Bitcoin cap?
