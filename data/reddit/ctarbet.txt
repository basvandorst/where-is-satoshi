What if you wake up and have 1 cent in your bank account and can't prove there was ever more money in there because you never bothered to save any statements?  This happens.. just read r/personalfinance.
What if a nasty relative / roommate / etc. stole your bitcoins and you go to court.  No proof, no recovery.

I always ask myself... what would I do if my Coinbase / GDAX accounts were empty one day?
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:39:52
...immediately converted to fiat currency with auto-sell.  Just like all the vendors who "accept bitcoin".
You can't sell your residence for BTC that may drop 30% in a few days.  That would destroy most people's finances.

How does avoiding the dollar save you from *your country* being deep in debt?  If there is a real crash, there won't be any resources to buy, regardless of what currency you use.  Bitcoin, pesos, dollars, gold... it won't matter if there aren't enough eggs anyway.

Ha!  Thanks for saying what I always think when I read these comments.  Profit is what you have when you spend the money.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:52
No one knows, which is why it is speculation and not investment.  
Some people tout the benefits of limited supply, but limited supply will not allow the money supply to grow.  People are mad about "money printing" but there are sound economic reasons that we create money over time and allow for easy access to debt.
What if a single satoshi was worth $10?  Forget about buying a soda with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:49:36
Hmmmm, tail wags the dog.  Seems to fit bitcoin very well.  The rumor that it will be going up is what causes it to go up.  It's valuable because "someday it will be more valuable".  Great article, thanks for posting real content!

I don't think that's right.   A short squeeze is caused by rising value - not the other way around.

Risk is volatility.  If you decide to spend bitcoin when the value happens to be very low, you aren't getting as much consumption for each BTC.

The smallest unit of bitcoin.  You can't cut up a penny and use it as two coins so healthy inflation eventually makes the penny worthless and people just stop using it.
Bitcoins can be divided, but only so far.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:38:08
...like the rest of us lol.  IRS had to force Coinbase because so few bitcoin users report any gains.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:19:03
Nothing matters except what people think about bitcoin.  Lots of shorts means it will tank.  Lots of people "just buy bro, dollar-cost-average and it will be great in 2 years" means it will rise.

Great job!  Watch out for [mental accounting]( though.  All your income is the same income which means your smoking and bitcoin aren't related, it just feels that way.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:28:37
Because there is no regulation of bitcoin, this kind of thing could happen.  It's easy to trade bitcoin with bots 24/7 with nothing to stop the market in case of a flash crash caused by automated ordering.
On the other hand, the flash crash chart shows massive drop and return to normal very quickly.  It provides a great example of why holding is a good idea.  Everyone who sold during the flash crash was screwed.  Everyone who wasn't even paying attention didn't even notice.

What if it goes to zero for any of a number of reasons?  Everyone who ever bought will lose their entire investment *and* all the growth they would have otherwise enjoyed with a traditional investment over the years.  History only remembers the speculators who get out with a profit.

So you say that it's pretty clear most bitcoin purchase is speculation which will cause the price to rise.... basically without limit?  The only downward pressure is fearful leaps out of the market based on bad news and occasional conversion for spending. Good news = gains?

It's not going to happen unless the government requires a report from the exchange directly just like a 1099 or W2 that cannot be escaped.  
Possibly, they could tax transactions directly.  That would have the positive side effect of reducing day-trading speculation type stuff and stabilize the currency a bit.

The average American receives a W2 and an associated tax bill that must be paid in order to avoid wage garnishment and prison.  There's no way to avoid that little triangle.
