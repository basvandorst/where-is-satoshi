Listen kid, it's a well known and clearly understood term that should be easily comprehended, even by someone of your ilk.  What you're attempting to do, clumsily I might add, is called "gaslighting" (I know, I know ... another term you'll need to look up, then pretend you knew all along).  
Since you don't understand definitions and need examples to grasp concepts, it's having someone point to a blue sky, saying "the sky is blue" and then having a person like yourself try to instill doubt that it's really blue.
So, please don't converse with me further and don't PM me (I won't read it, it'll be deleted immediately). But if you *really* need closure, then feel free to add your final comment below so that you can "win" this debate, because I grow weary of your foolishness (don't worry, I won't reply to it either).  All the best.

Any evidence he's incompetant or you just don't like him because (1) he likes Ethereum or (2) Coinbase is forced to adhere to KYC/AML regulations under US law or (3) his shiny shirt?

I highlighted the word "most" by italicizing it, so that you wouldn't read it as "all".  Maybe I should have used bold.

Almost as soon as he'd implemented the block size limit, he was discussing the methodology for how to remove it at some later date:
If he'd intended it as a permanent limit, he wouldn't be wasting his time discussing the best way to remove it.

I deleted the earlier comment (which said essentially the same thing) because I thought *"maybe they're right .. maybe Teechan won't be ridiculed simply because it's not Core"*
Then I saw the attacks coming in and realized my instincts had been right.  So, I put the comment back up.  In this sub it's Core Uber Alles and all alternatives must be shot down, with extreme prejudice. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 00:52:25

That's how he does it.  He couches his 'predictions' with wording such as 'I hope', 'it should', 'let's see', etc. so that they're not really predictions as such -  but can be made to look like predictions in hindsight (if successful) or dismissed as just observations (if unsuccessful).

I know that people use Bitcoin.  What I question is the statement that it's a "defacto world currency", which implies usage that's several orders of magnitude more than it currently is.
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:43:30
My accounts are always fresh because I post for a few months without issue, then find myself canceling my account because I'm wasting too much time online.  A week later I think "hmm .. I've gotta respond to that post", so I create another account and the cycle repeats.  I don't care about the 'glory' that comes with Reddit karma points, so it matter little to me what account I use.
As to why you should care about my opinion, only you can answer that - you're the one who took the time to respond to my post.

What did he do to make you consider him an idiot?
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:43:08
His 'big news' will probably be an announcement of the launch date for Bitcache/MU2, probably several months away.
@_date: 2017-01-14 00:49:56
He's an eternal optimist.  But I guess we need people like him around to counterbalance the negativity.

I'm not a trader, but this is my superficial understanding:
* No more shorting -&gt; no motivation for whales to drive price down anymore
* Only remaining way to profit from Bitcoin now is to go long -&gt; motivation for whales to drive price up.
Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:46:31
Based on the above, it'll never get to 95%.  Unless we want years of stagnation, it's time for a Plan B on scaling.

You think my opinion of this sub is based on this one example? Please ... this sub is toxic towards anything with even a hint of non-Core influence.  The 'noise' you speak of is deafening in here.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:27:56
I don't think so.  I suspect one of the reasons the Bitcoin ETF (which is the REAL moonshot) was having trouble getting approved was the extreme volatility (relative to *most* assets) of BTC and the influence of Chinese speculators on the price.  Although day traders love volatility, investors do not - and the ETF is primarily an investment vehicle.
The Chinese government's actions today are very likely to reduce volatility significantly, and in turn increase the chances of the Bitcoin ETF getting approved as a consequence.

That's why I provided a link above explaining what 'ad hominem' means.  Don't let the latin wording scare you - it's good to learn new things.  
*"argumentum ad hominem, is a logical fallacy in which an argument is rebutted by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself."*
So, to keep it simple, brg444's comment that my account is 11 days old is a lazy way of attempting to dismiss the *content* of what I wrote.

No.  It's like owning an Italian restaurant that only served pizza, but then adding pasta to the menu with an ad saying "The Pizza is good, but the pasta is really where it's at!"
EDIT: pizza/pasta confusion.

Listen kid, I've been following Bitcoin since around the time Satoshi made that post.  Back then, it was mentioned countless times on the BT board, even during the period when Satoshi was still active on the board, that 'we' could increase the block size later.
It's true that the language was always couched in terms such as "we can" or "we could" (rather than "we will" or "we should") but if you'd been around then you'd know that this was because we didn't know whether we'd ever reach the point where blocks would actually be full!  You have to remember that Bitcoin was a nascent 'movement' back then and no-one was 100% sure that it would still be around by 2017.
Bitcoin has a long and complex history, so I suggest you do some reading because clearly you've allowed yourself to be brainwashed by historical revisionists on this sub and become one of their [useful idiots](

The reason his company exists is because he and Brian Armstrong wanted to make money.  With few exceptions, that's the reason all companies exist.  I'm sure he still supports Coinbase's mission ... which, again, is to make money.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:24:31
There's no love lost between Coinbase and Core.  It's just a simple case of "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em".  Pure pragmatism.  The alternative is years of stalemate, which is no good for anyone.

The 21 million limit has been the part of Bitcoin from the first release of the Bitcoin client (v. 0.1.0) on January 8th 2009.  It's the cornerstone of Bitcoin and the limit was stated explicitly in Satoshi's accompanying post to the cryptography mailing list that same day.
The 1MB block size was an anti-spam measure he added in late 2010 as a *temporary* fix.  It was never intended to be an eternal constant.
To paraphrase the man himself, if you don't get the difference between the two, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.

He wanted a code variable currently set to 1, to become 2.
Evil bastard.

Yes, derivatives are important.  However, the claim being made is not about the *importance* of Bitcoin, but rather about its *popularity* as a currency (i.e. a 'de facto world currency').  They're two different things.
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:33:37


* Developed by a group that's not Core?  Check!
* Promoted by someone who's positive about Ethereum?  Check!
On the basis of the above, this technology will be ridiculed and attacked on this sub.

They were writing about the price action and both articles were accurate, at the time they were written.
If I write an article saying on Dec 30th "Ronda Rousey is making her comeback" and on Dec 31st another saying "She was demolished" ... again, both articles would be accurate.
Would you want them to have a specific bias on Bitcoin and only report news that's consistent with that bias?

I think you're confusing the American concept of Jesus, which is based on [prosperity theology]( (a modern invention) with the Jesus as described in the Bible (who is quite a different character).
If you believe the accounts in the Bible, Jesus had all the hallmarks of a 'lefty'.
After all, he supposedly gave 5000 people free food (bread and fish) and provided free medical treatment (curing many).  All that does is promote a welfare state mentality right? /s
Of course, it's all just magical thinking from my point of view.

The same as it ever was.  Behind all the libertarian, anti-government rhetoric ... *most* of us are primarily interested in Bitcoin as an investment and will applaud whatever helps the price to rise.
