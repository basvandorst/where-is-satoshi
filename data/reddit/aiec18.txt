Is it possible to hardfork Bcash and make all coins just vanish or invalid?
@_date: 2018-09-07 13:00:17
What is possible if some someone would 51% attack Bcash?

And still they say: "Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin"

Don't give someone who doesn't like Bitcoin Bitcoin. It will and up like: Friend gave me 100k$ in Bitcoin but accidentally threw away private keys kind of story

20k $ same price would be better

Its good but Its 10€ per transaction. Not really a good entry level for new people that just want to try it out.
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:15:09
Did you try it out OP?
@_date: 2018-10-06 10:19:39
So does this relative low price mean there's more people short than long? Also, which exchanges shows the real value of bitcoin?

A question from the “hardest” quiz: “what’s the maximum supply of bitcoin?”

They probably made over 1 billion profits breaking the law. Now they only have to pay back half.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:13:31
Never seen this before! Well Done OP
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:15:51
This tweet is just wrong. They claim 4.5% interest with LTV 50%, but you only get 20% LTV.
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:30:31
Don’t post pics of your kids on reddit.
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:32:49
Nope, i just checked the site. A 10k loan costs you 11.25% interest a year.
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:20:56
Just convert the Bitcoin into Bitcoin cash. Then send it.
@_date: 2019-01-10 12:10:27
Cool! How do you accept them? With bitpay?
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:55:58
What's the point of getting a lower interest rate if you only get 20% LTV? Also i don't know if you priced in the 2% origination fee.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:29:26
Cool! It’s good seeing more of these popping up. Have you checked what the fees are?

NEXO worked fine for me, took a loan in USDT. Over 3000 USDT loans were given 20 mil+. Even more in fiat but you can’t track that on the blockchain. NEXO is a company with its STO token which already received dividends from the company NEXO back in December (3+ mil net profit)
@_date: 2019-01-11 21:34:08
If i had 1M $ of Bitcoin i would rather have 500k with 8% interest than only 200k with 6.5%. Then you can buy 2.5x more investment property or buy a bigger house.

@_date: 2018-07-16 20:26:58
Wait what. Price goes down more bitcoin?!
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:50:48
No you said that if price went down my money is worth more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 20:55:11
r/woooosh I meant it as a joke because it’s Ethereum not “Etherium”
@_date: 2018-07-16 21:16:37
I don’t know either i lost track of it too.

Where did you find the tie?
@_date: 2018-07-01 09:22:19
If everyone just used 1 sat/byte for normal transactions and 2 sat/byte for really urgent ones. Wouldnt that solve so many problems?
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:51:55
I’m more like a day trader, so I have my coins on a exchange all the time.
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:00:25
You're an idiot if you do that lol
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:47:43
Hmmm 1% daily... Where have I seen that before?
