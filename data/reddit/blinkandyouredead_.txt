This is the dumbest shit I've read all day
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:00:36
Fixed, thanks!
Suspicious of what btw?

Draper was/is family friends with Elizabeth Holmes' family. When he says he supports her and Theranos, it seems it's because of a ~~bestest~~ vested interest for him to do so. 
It's this quality that makes me suspicions of his very bullish claims for Bitcoin's price.
I mean, as much as I'd like to believe that BTC will get as high as he predicts; he's demonstrated that he'll talk total bullshit if he's got a vested interest to do so.
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:03:42
It's already taxed as an asset - don't see why that'll change anytime soon either...
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:47:31
Why would the government seize Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:07:48
This is exactly what he is getting at :)

Gemini's support is just as bad. They ignore twitter, don't allow Facebook posts asking for support, and of course redirect all support emails to a nameless account who doesn't read the fucking mail.
Fuck Gemini.

They did it when gold was backing the USD during a time of crisis.
"Trump is a wildcard" isn't a great reason.
I still don't understand why Bitcoin would be confiscated, it sounds more like Chicken Licken logic to me than a possible outcome.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:41:14
Again, your opinion, I don't think he was encouraged. I mean, we can disagree on the subtext...
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:06:12
a) this had been addressed elsewhere here ad nauseum, he already had a life sentence from his
b) other crimes
I did agree with OP's point, and addressed your follow-up questions in my original post.
@_date: 2019-02-20 01:03:57
Don't bother. People like this formed their opinion by faith; they are immune to facts 
@_date: 2019-02-14 09:40:04
These points have been raised and addressed elsewhere in this thread
@_date: 2019-02-14 09:48:38
Unbeknownst to Ross, he ordered the hit from FBI agents. Check it out:

In fairness to E-Coin, at least it is less volatile 
@_date: 2019-02-14 09:41:57
Yes, which is exactly what I said.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:02:20
He wasn't charged with them, only by virtue of the the fact they had enough on him besides that. It doesn't change the fact he gave the orders; so, again, for a fruitful conversation, don't just ignore it.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:09:03
He was ordering executions on people who were threatening his business... Hardly laudible. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:11:58
I read the correspondence, I didn't this he was encouraged, but that's a personal opinion; as is yours and everyone else's as he was never tried on this. 
What is not in dispute is that he gave orders for the execution of others; this is not an act that others can find a lot of sympathy for.
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:51:05
Way to not read the other comments explaining why this is
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:17:56
Yes, but do you even know why he wasn't prosecuted for it? It's kind of an important detail.
You can actually find the reason in the court docs...
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:06:49
Those chats were pulled from his actual computer, it was him. 
When explaining away attempted murder with conspiracy theories you do nothing to help Ross. It's more likely he was stressed, and wouldn't likely ever do that again, which is the path to redemption that can't be overstated. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:39:54
Yup, one of many sources I've looked at, from multiple perspectives. I guess I just don't buy the conspiracy angle.
@_date: 2019-02-13 22:03:49
Dumbest reply so far
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:35:04
Ross ordered hits on 4/5 people total. The evidence that he did this is clear. 
No one here likes talking about this because it ruins the narrative. 
Now, the sentence for ordering a hit in California is (IIRC) ten years per contract, so he definitely got a harsher sentence than this, but there were other crimes he was guilty of. 
Not that it'll save me from downvotes, but El Chapo is significantly worse than Ross, and any system that gives Chapo less time than Ross is busted. 
But, to ignore that Ross *didn't* try and have people executed is doing no favors to anyone who wants to have an honest discussion about justice.
EDIT: I was expecting to be downvoted, not get silver! Thank you kind stranger, for encouraging a nuanced and difficult discussion!
EDIT 2: wow, gold! Seriously, thanks again for the encouragement, my faith in Reddit actually being able to have grown-up conversations is actually in danger of being restored...
What? 
Too optimistic?
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:31:40
My understanding is that is just for ordering. If the person is actually killed, then yea, prepare for some hard time.
@_date: 2019-02-14 09:44:07
Any theory involving conspiracies needs some work
@_date: 2019-02-13 23:02:53
It wasn't introduced because he already had a life sentence. Those are the facts, reasons and motivations beyond that are speculative (and normally a little conspiratorial)
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:23:28
And now he's silent and won't admit he was wrong
Good job facts!
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:48:38
@_date: 2019-01-31 04:37:20
This is a great point!
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:57:23
Um. I suspect you think that was quite witty
@_date: 2018-11-10 17:33:30
I thought it was 87.2% of people
@_date: 2019-01-31 16:23:20
No, the blockchain is one though
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:34:05
Ok, but you didn't write it though
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:36:24
No, I get your point.... It's just not a very good one ��

Haven't you heard? Everyone is alt-right these days, and Hitler is apparently several world leaders
@_date: 2019-01-30 20:05:28
No doubt I'll get loads of downvotes, but the difference though is that there was nothing comparable to the internet before its invention. 
Blockchain is good for a decentralized database, but we already have currencies and databases; so it's not filling the vacuum that the internet did.

The car is essentially a faster version of horses..
The iPhone is essentially a portable version of a payphone..
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:15:49
So your problem is that people who have no knowledge of crypto sees its value?
This is in fact what adoption looks like.

The only problem here is where is the list of numbers-words kept? When I retire in 20 years time and want to use my stash of BTC, I don't want to rely on the wayback machine to decode anything...
