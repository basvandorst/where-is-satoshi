Good news. I asked them and got this answer:
"You'll be glad to know we are currently exploring other, more flexible payment options for the future (including Bitcoin). There are a host of other new features coming down the pipeline too, so there isn't a set timetable just yet. Please stay tuned."

BCH is mentioned in the post but the post is not really all about that. It's actually about the scaling issue which cannot really be discussed without mentioning BCH.

I read that it's meant to be 2 weeks after lock in, which was August 8th, so August 22nd afaik

Damn. Nowhere near low enough for small transactions then, which would require another order of magnitude or two. 
After a look at  it appears that even LTC and BCH fees are too high for small transactions, especially for in the developing world.

Thanks. I've read a bit more about it since your clarifying post. It seems that the LN risks are as yet difficult to fully predict. I'm guessing that it will be introduced gradually. May the experiment continue!

sounds reasonable. I actually already placed a sell order at $6105 yesterday. 
I really hope that it's more down to Fibonacci levels than Tone Vays support levels

I reckon they've made 8 figures by now, basically from selling into the over-exuberance of all those 'B trash' followers and FOMO fools

could be. But retesting 3k is probably well within the BCh flipenning vulnerability zone.

Here too. 2.5 months now. This is very much the sort of thing you see an exchange do just before they do a runner. Now that I've withdrawn my funds, I'll never be returning to Poloniex that's for sure! I don't want to cause you extra worry, but this sort of behaviour is what I've come to expect from exchanges which are about to either go insolvent, or do a runner.

yup. Everything is going to be OK
