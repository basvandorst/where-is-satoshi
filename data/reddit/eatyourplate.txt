And what does it tell you that they don't?
Don't worry, the banks don't care. 
And downvoted for pointing out facts. This sub...

Sounds like a great solution to their cash payments. I bet they're setting up Bitcoin wallets as they speak. I mean setting something up like Paypal with their partners is out of the question of course. No, let's use Bitcoin. 
Will you let them know their transactions won't go through because of a "stress test" by the way?
Edit: downvoters, feel free to downvote me but also please let me know where i'm wrong. Just downvoting things you don't like is just so childish you know.

No. Just funding from banks or cards isn't working. Just like people can't buy Bitcoin. Paypal itself isn't shut down. So my point is still valid.

 I bet you feel pretty goddamn stupid right now.

You're absolutely right. And the fact that you're getting downvoted is usually a good indication of that in this sub. 
These people want countries to move to Bitcoin. A currency that will stop working if you spend a few 1000 dollars a day to sabotage it. 
It's ridiculous. Yet if you mention this completely obvious flaw they will downvote you to hell.

Ok let me see. You suggest they should start using Bitcoin. A system that nobody there currently uses. They need to set it up, learn about it and then find someone from outside the country who can fund their wallets. Which will be near impossible. Let alone all the issues Bitcoin currently has. 
Or they could use Paypal. A system that probably tons of Greeks already have and understand and tons of people from outside the country can send to them. 
Yeah, such a hard choice. But what does a dumb 0 day account like me know. 
It's funny how you people act like noooo you can't use Paypal but you can use Bitcoin. As it's complete bs. 
And off topic: you know what scares me? How you people right away go through someone's account in pure rage when you read something you don't like. That is really disturbing behavior. Do you realize that?

In the meantime you're replying to every post i make. 
Stop making such a fool of yourself man. It's just sad to watch. You seriously look like a 12 year old right now. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:02:11
Yeah, i bet that is the real reason. Seriously, who are you trying to fool? Yourself? Me?
I'm sure you realize nobody actually believes this and that you look very pathetic right now. 
The things you people do just to avoid having to admit Bitcoin isn't perfect is insane. Absolutely insane.
