Yes but no but yes. The big irony with bitcoin is that if you had a full team of crypto experts, you could somehow identify who transacted what and where - maybe not by name, but you'd have an idea of a unique identifier from which you can doxx based on purchases. In fact there's a team somewhere that's building a graph of all transactions for that very purpose, look up 'tcp black ops defcon' on youtube, second part of the video.
But it's not a case of 'tracing' the coins 'moving around' because well, they don't move around in practice plus, they get mixed everytime they sit in a shared pool/wallet. The thieves know how to use these 'mixing services' very well indeed...

You're incredibly naive if you think this is a case of ze evil corporate attacking poor little Mtgox. The mtgox corporation exists only to make money, and has proven ruthless when it comes to customer support, feedback and communications. They don't care about you, your coins, or BTC in general. 
Furthermore, looks like coin~~base~~lab has good basis for its lawsuit, considering that the behaviour they are suing for is exactly what we all saw in the last month.

The wallst guys don't host on the cloud, they run their own DCs. There are also dropoff points in every country. The size of these dropoff points alone, and the money invested in them would make your head spin. Think entire buildings. 
Not bashing AWS, i'm a customer and it's really good for many things, but hosting transactional platforms relating to money isn't one of them.

He's posted on Twitter things like ' as if it made a difference wether 1 or 1million users mined. He also seem to believe that   the exchange rate with local currencies is linked to 'how many coins are mined'. People tried to explain to him (look at the conversations) and he still didn't get it. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:47:47
I've been saying that they are behind it since the day I spent a length of time studying their behaviour. The day before the 'crash', a lot of people on IRC were making note of bot activity and reporting it to channel and GOX support. 
That same day, there was very little lag, in fact it was probably one of their busiest day yet they suffered no technical issue at all. In the evening they announced they were being DDOSed, out of the blue, for no reason. No reference to bots. 
The day after, the market goes into freefall, gox lags behind by a whole 6 minutes, it's clearly a panic sell. That's when they decide to announce a DDOS, which makes no sense. It gets better. They then suspend trade, claiming it's to 'cool the market'. But that same night, they announce that it was just a routine server upgrade. Wot?
2 weeks later, still no mention of bots. In short:
- They act as if bots didn't exist
- Bots and market manipulation are getting more and more frequent (just look at the last 2 weeks, volume is at 4-500, then bang, massive buys/sell at 10K+
- Whenever something doesn't quite go to their taste, they claim a DDOS and never post any proof
- They act as if they didn't understand how to use twitter. Of course they understand how to use it. They just don't want to.

You nailed it. People talk about the current valuation for bitcoin being about it's potential in the *future*. I don't disagree it has indeed huge potential, but that future isn't in my view short or mid term. Anyone who worked in the transactional space knows that upgrading ePOS systems is a 2 to 3 year process at major retailers. Yes, online retailers do not have that problem, I realize that. But the major ones will have their legal and finance teams scratching their heads for a long time before they push the 'go' button.
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:08:40
Right, so if you believe in this chart enough to post it here, surely you've sold everything you owned and invested it in bitcoin? Because that's 10x ROI within 12 month here, only a fool wouldn't buy that. Can you tell us how many BTC you're holding at the moment?

Nothing. Difficulty will continue to increase. The current hashrate is 70.82 TH. A 50GH BFL rig (which no one has seen yet by the way), cost 2500. Assuming they are even real, you'd need 1,400 (3.5M USD) of these puppies to match the current hash rate on your own, assuming that no one else in the world bought them and assuming you have a DC to power them. 
Furthermore, the current price valuation isn't supported by the hashrate, but by other factors (and what these are widely debated, but unfortunately not on reddit). The hashrate could be 1GH, or 1PH, bitcoin would still have the same intrinsic value it holds today and held yesterday.

You might be successful at it, then again you might not. During the crash the differential was at 30$ between some exchanges. You can keep track of exchanges at  (under the 'arbitrage' section). 
What's the catch? Well the catch is that it takes time to transfer the coins from A-&gt;B. :)

You make a good point, of course there's a security aspect to it, but it can resolved: bank deposit box, hidden/fireproof safe at home, etc. 
As for the 'what can you buy with it', yes, it's a problem in itself. I think if you're looking at things like luxury cars, property, big ticket items like that it's even a tough problem. But if you're looking at spending the 100k over 12 month like you would spend your salary, it's really doable - most places accept cash, and rent could be managed by just knowing a willing landlord (i used to pay my rent in cash for a long time when I was student).

You're absolutely correct, and this is the MAIN issue with BTC today. I am paying for a few things in BTC (servers mostly) which are now non-trivial sums, and let me tell you that the crash and the subsequent rollercoaster between 120-150 has made spending/acquiring BTC a difficult and complex decision process. 
TL;DR: not a currency until the speculators have left.

@_date: 2013-04-28 11:41:08
They don't even need to make it illegal to seriously limit its growth. The guys from blockchain.info have stated on these forums that Barclays 'didn't want anything to do with bitcoin' and this is why they had to remove the pingit integration. Transferwise has now suspended transfers to exchanges for that very same reason. There are 4 major banking groups in the UK. Only 3 to go, yet not a single law passed. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:27:07
Great idea! Also, take a loan. And ask money from your family. When you can't get loans from the bank anymore, use pay day loans, after all, it's due to double up every week or so nowadays so what could possibly go wrong? 
Remember, if it crashes you can only lose 100% of what you have invested. But if you don't invest, you stand to lose 1000% or even 10,000% of what you could have put in! In fact you're missing out right now - during the time it took me to write this article we went from 240 to 250 already! Can you feel that feeling of missing out? Sell all your possessions now and buy all the bitcoins you can, you can then just sell a fraction of it next week and rebuy everything you sold. 
Imagine how great you'll feel when the BTC reaches 1,000,000 per bitcoin (its' GUARANTEED - because Visa transacts 4 trillions or something), but how horrible you'll feel for having missed out. 
Also, and this is very important, when you see it go from say, 500 to 300 - DO NOT SELL! it's very important that no one sells. Spartans, HOLD! Plus, it's not a crash, remember, because it was a 20 bucks a few month ago so 500&gt;250 is actually a RISE in valuation. 
Finally don't listen to people who say you can't buy anything with BTC. You can buy anything! I mean I heard you could buy groceries through this website, forgot the name, but it will come back to me. What are you still doing here? Buy buy buy!

Funny that people think the danger to bitcoin is the government, or speculation. The real danger to bitcoin is that it does not scale. The official bitcoin wiki on the subject has been heavily edited:  - the original page showed how you'd need a 3TB hard drive every 21 days if you wanted to hold the blockchain once it reaches VISA-only levels of TPS (2000).
End results: we're going to see an avalanche of SPV clients (including QT, which is likely to go SPV on next release), and the actual nodes processing the traffic becoming 'mega nodes', centralising the control of the network into the hands of the few. 
I love bitcoin, and I think crypto currencies are the future, but bitcoin is not that currency.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:20:29

I'm not arguing that BTC has the *potential* to be a new technology that could revolutionise/is revolutionising the payment processing industry. 
But I also think you'll look back on this post with regret. You sound desperate to prove that the current valuation isn't a bubble. The bottom line is that the moment there's no possible way to say if it is a bubble or not, but the sign points towards 'overvalued' (the actual number of 'retail' transactions is dwarfed by the volumes exchanged speculatively - there's a post on r/bitcoin comparing the current market cap to fiat currencies demonstrating this quite well). 
My take is once the 'hardcore', ie the guys who were sitting on dozens of thousands of btc from 3 years back have cashed out, the 'noobs' that joined on the promise of a quick buck won't form a solid support during the wild swings, and it will tumble down quickly (as no one on the exchanges will be left to prop it up under the ideology that 'it's the future').
In fact, i'll speculate that the thursday 30% dip was just that, and that the support is currently very weak indeed. We'll see.

Voted your comment up, and I agree with you that in the majority of the cases (bitcoin24, etc) it's indeed a case of breaching AML. However, in the case of barclays vs blockchain and barclays vs transferwise, I believe it to be a case of barclays explicitly forbidding a business account to be transacting bitcoin. Transferwise is particularly telling, as they aren't at all a bitcoin service, but a generic money transfer service that just happens to be used for bitcoins. 
I guess I could call them and check, would be curious to hear their opinions.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:04:38
I agree - at this point I suspect it's not incompetence, it's engineered. During the 75$ dip 2 weeks ago they have been repeatedly encouraged to use twitter or any other channel to comunicate with their user base.
It's as if they enjoy the mass panic - i'm getting a feeling they are profiting from it. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:30:51
That's exactly what will deflate BTC, but OK. I sold anyway, so you guys hoard all you want.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:48:31
Well, as a crypto currency, in my view the BTC is worth a good 30-50.
With MTSCAM involved, it's worth exactly 0 though.

Why not SEPA straight from your bank account, using the drop down option to send money in EUR instead of GBP? My barclays account allows me to do that. I've used BS before, I can't complain about the service (2.5 days to get money in, 2.5 days to get the money out. 
On the way back, I believe (I'm not sure, because I havent tried when I sold) for it to be possible to specify in the comment that you want the money to be transited in GBP and not EUR. You'd have to ask them to be sure.

What is it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:06:06
2 weeks ago during the 75$ dip there was a number of people who highlighted publicly mtgox shortcomings such as: unexplainable lack of scaling on the frontend web side of things, and zero coms during lag leading to panic.
3 days ago people started to highlight bots trading and creating lag, only for MTGOX to announce there was no DDOS in place (I guess the bots, seen by everyone, logged by dozens if not hundreds of sites, only exist in our imagination)
Not only did mtgox did sweeetfuckall about it, they took it in stride, and seem to operate as a law of their own. This culminated with todays 'halt' in trade for no particular reason (except transferring their own personal coins of course), and a reopen which will terminate the BTC speculation once and for all.
Apart from that? Yeah they're great.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:16:09

 is in my view slightly likely to likely:
* gvt in the US has already been seen trying to get shops to report 'suspicious' cash transactions on the basis of anonymity = bad. And i'm not talking about 10k+ for AML.
* gvt is in pocket of major trx processing interest groups, or at least heavily lobbied. How long till visa/mc/amex strike a deal?
* gvt has been known to like to flag certain technologies as 'enabling terrorism'

First, to the OP: don't kill yourself. Even if it crashes down to 0 it's just money, and you have years of life in front of you to experience new things. At worse, you made a mistake and learned a lesson. If you do feel genuinely suicidal and have the means to do it, contact samaritans immediately.
Second: on these very boards I made a number of comments , sometimes vitriolic I admit, that the 'spartan hold' crew is going to drive people to do stupid things. On the btctalk forums I went as far as saying the attitude here would drive people to suicide, and that when the crash happened the 'spartans' will be revealed as very small holders , turning into the righteous 'you should not have invested more than you could afford to lose' as soon as the coin fell. I am now proven right from the comments below. You should all be very ashamed of your greed and stupidity.

First, because they took pre-orders - they didn't have the funds to just go and build all these ASICS for their own use. 
Second, because difficulty is going to increase at the same rate the hashing power increases. They only get one shot at this, but they aren't the only players in the game.... so they'd rather sell tools to the miners rather than mine themselves.
In short, it's easier to raise money by placing preoders, then sell short lived tools to greedy miners.

Assuming the bitcoin rises to 1 billion USD per btc:

Regarding having to declaring BTC income regarding of country, that's completely false. False I tell you! Source: My accountant here in the UK. I've explained to him bitcoin, he reckons that at this very moment it would be treated as earning from gambling, meaning you only declare the interest on the savings account you've place it into.
IANAA, but he was very clear on this point. Also, you will get checked for AML if you SEPA more than 10k in your account (even in small chunks) in a short enough period of time. So if you are indeed a millionaire get financial advice right now and preempt the inevitable HMRC raid. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:06:14
If your bank saw you randomly receiving large sums, they would flag it to the authorities as they required by AML. Tax would become your least worry at that point, because these guys would just freeze your assets until they figured out what's going on. If you plan to convert large amount of btc to fiat, make sure you:
- contact an accountant ASAP
- notify your bank, then WORK with them in order to insure they are well aware and OK with what's going on
- declare all income as you would with regular FIAT

It applies in my view, as the mass fluctuations we've recently seen are the work of manipulators and bots, and not the process of re-evaluating the value of BTC based on its actual adoption. That said, the initial spike was likely the product of mainstream media activity. So it's arguable that's its *entirely* random, since a large event such as mtgox hack or paypal adoption would defo influence price.

You're absolute correct about the numbering - mine is up to 54 tonight but your mileage may vary.
As for the links in question, just parse the last few block files to find them. You can't miss them, it's a wall of text. The text is extracted from what appears to be the 'Hidden wiki' on TOR. The links are clearly labelled with very descriptive terms of what's behind them. Of course, it could all be fake, and just random numbers labelled incorrectly, practical-joke style. But I doubt it.
The whole thing was clearly done in jest, it's not someone trying to distribute illegal material but more about making a point. He probably grabbed the most offensive page of link he could find, thought it was horrible enough, and posted it at a fairly high cost.
I also doubt it's the government, if it was the government they would have gone for the jugular and mass posted these links without bothering with the Hidden Wiki text dump. They have enough money to flood the whole chain with links, endoded jpegs or whatever else.

 -  companies that have converted btc to local fiat while maintaining balances in BTC to their customers (see: every gambling site out there)  == trading insolvent the minute it drops

I'm a cynical bastard yet I approve of this message. This deserves front page! Upvote!

I think what's happened is that in apparently good faith, the operator of b24 was running the whole exchange from a regular bank account, thinking 'what' wrong with that'. No really, I hope he's just impossibly naive - because anyone who ever tried to operate a business in the EU will tell you that opening a business account is difficult for a REASON. 
Why he didn't seek legal advice, notify his bank and the local HMRC as he saw he wasn't playing with trivial money is beyond me. But then again the SO questions are also beyond me.
We're either looking at a village idiot who got lucky, or a scammer looking to make an exit through the usual 'let it rot' strategy.

- scalability, maybe, although I'm not entirely convinced (yes I know about bloom filters)
- anonymity, I'd say, definitely not. Colored coins, para coins, it's all going nowhere fast and defo not feeling the love of the devs. Furthermore, people smarter than me have highlighted it's likely bitcoin went for anonymity initially but backed down, due to technological limitations
- instant: i'm not sure, but I doubt it - see threads re: 'why is the difficult set so a block is found every 10 minutes'.

Obvious shill post. If you're going to promote your service, that's fine, but at least be honest about the fact it's a promotion.

This is a fascinating reply, thank you! The bank option is a good one, but that's assuming we're talking about the buyer's bank, because as a seller, depositing the cash in an account is the last thing I want to do :)
I suppose the buyer's bank is the 'safest' option, unless you can set up maybe your own little trading desk at a regus-type facility you rent out for a day.

That's really neat. Thank you for pointing that one out!
