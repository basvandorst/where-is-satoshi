Smaller blocks don‘t make sense, Lightning transactions have to be relayed to the blockchain at some time. 1 MB is fine for now, and when Lightning becomes very succesful blocks will have to be a little larger.

The 25th word is not stored anywhere, so it can't be brute forced. Every time a user of an encrypted Trezor enter a "password" (25th word) he generates the private keys by adding a 25th word to the 24 word seed. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:49:52
1. Because the network is being spammed so the mempool gets larger
2. Hashrate being diverted to BCH so the mempool gets larger

@_date: 2017-08-17 08:43:56
You can not brute force the last word, because Trezor passwords are not stored anywhere on the device or computer. The passwords / 25th words only exist in the head of the user. You enter them every time you use the Trezor as a 25th word.

Funny though, I just spent a nice long vacation using a Mobi credit card filled with bitcoins, and I pay my rent and most of my bills via Bitwala nowadays. Maybe now you'll say "but that's like selling". My point is, I feel pretty rich with my bitcoins, ethers and dash while spending them without ever having to use an exchange to sell. That's where we are already. Bitcoin credit cards and crypto payment providers such as Bitwala work great. Give it a few more years and you can pay everything via a Bitcoin app on your phone. I have absolutely no need to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:10:36
Ripple as a payment company was around years before Bitcoin even existed. After the invention of Bitcoin they developed their own blockchain. I am not a big fan of their model, because it's less open than Bitcoin, but at least they're doing their own thing and have been working on alternative money and payment solutions for many years. Bitcoin Cash on the other hand is a poorly implemented copy of Bitcoin with some parts of the original code ripped out, launched in a rushed and amateurish manner. Compared to Ripple, BCH does not deserve a better rank imho. I'd rather see Litecoin there.

At the moment, one bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis, so the smallest unit is 0.00000001 BTC. It's trivial to add more decimal points, therefore subsidized block rewards / halving can go on forever, should it ever be needed. (Edit:  iascash replied at the same time I did, same answer basically, I agree with him 100%).
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:01:55
This, and because the Bitcoin blockchain is being attacked by Bcash. The BCH blockchain uses the same mining algorithm as Bitcoin, but with a modified difficulty algorithm that artificially pushes rewards of BCH up and therefore draws away hash power from Bitcoin. This slows down confirmations, and the Bcash camp uses this to push the narrative of "Segwit not working".
Segwit transactions will speed up confirmations soon - but it will take a few days.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:21:22

@_date: 2017-08-26 11:40:00
The Bitcoin blockchain is under attack in several ways at the moment. It is being spammed by the Bcash camp again. Half of the miners are mining the other chain because it has lower difficulty due to a change of Satoshi's difficulty algorithm in Bcash. Antminer is mining empty or half empty blocks. All that drives up BTC fees, so the BCH camp can say "look, Bitcoin is too expensive, Segwit doesnt work". Their plot works for now, but it will fail in the long term.
The situation will change in the next days and weeks as more and more Segwit outputs are created, Lightning networks start etc.
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:57:05
You don't need to "claim" them. They will be on the split blockchain at the exact same addresses your original bitcoins are. 
Installing a wallet though, and sending them to an exchange and trading them seems way to much hassle for me. It's just another shitcoin.

In that article he is completely ommitting the fact that a Trezor can be encrypted. You can use as many passwords as you want, they are additional 25th seed words. These passwords are not stored on the device. Only the owner of the Trezor knows them. So the hack would be useless to a thief, same as when he finds a paper with seed on it.

@_date: 2017-08-02 20:42:45
miners not only get the block rewards, but also the transaction fees.
furthermore, the 21 million bitcoins are never really reached, but approached asymptotically, so block reward halving goes on forever. eventually, a block reward will be just a few satoshis or even fractions of satoshis, but the transaction fees will be much more.

@_date: 2017-08-02 20:57:26
No, nothing to worry about. What I meant is that as the value of Bitcoin rises, a transaction fee of a few bits or satoshis will be worth more than a subsidized block reward of a few satoshis.

Satoshi would of course say that the true Bitcoin is the coin that follows Nakamoto consensus. BCH changed the rules without consensus, so it forked off and is therefore an altcoin.

Either use Electrum (on Mac or Windows) and write down the 12 word seed on 3 pieces of paper. Store those in 3 different locations (fire and water proof). 
Or get a hardware wallet. I recommend the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:29:58
It's even better: a thief can't brute force your password, because it's not stored anywhere.  Every password of n encrypted Trezor is an additional (25th) word of your seed - so it generates entirely new private keys / an entirely different wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:09:23
Please teach your son not to use Coinbase but a wallet that he controls the private keys of (e.g. Mycelium, Breadwallet, Green Address).
**Your key, your bitcoins. Not your key, not your bitcoins.** This is the most basic and most important principle of using Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin was invented so we *don't* have to trust a third party.

@_date: 2017-08-26 12:06:47
It's probably not the easiest one, but I prefer the Trezor, because it is the most secure hardware wallet. Reason: Trezor has additional encryption. You can use passwords on it that add an additional word to the seed. Each password is a 25th word of your 24 word seed, so it creates an entirely new set of private and public keys. Even a thief or burglar who steals your seed and Trezor can not access your coins. For me, that's the killer feature of the Trezor.

To steal any funds an attacker would have had to physically crack open the Trezor and attach cables to internal parts. Extracting the seed then would have been useless to him without knowing the passwords, which are the 25th word of the seed. Furthermore, the attack vector was patched already.
Anyway, thanks for letting me know about Trezor passwords, didnt know that.

Wrong. A blockchain is just one of several technological principles that make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work. Other important innovations are Proof of Work, decentralized node consensus. The term „blockchain technology“ is a misnomer. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin is not a company. The dotcom bubble killed companies, not the internet protocol TCP/IP and its many layers (HTTP, POP/SMTP, FTP, BitTorrent etc.) Bitcoin is an internet protocol. Companies that build business with Bitcoin can and will go broke in a market crash. Bitcoin keeps getting stronger as additional protocol layers get added.  Don‘t believe the „blockchain, not bitcoin“ hype. That story is being pushed mostly by banks in panic mode who don‘t understand the nature of internet protocols and their network effect.

rbtc is the flat earth society of cryptocurrency. Over there, you will hear conspiracy theories, made up technobabble and lies. They are desperately trying to shill for their own altcoin, BitcoinCash (Bcash, BCH), and will try to tell newcomers that their alt is "the real Bitcoin", even though its blocks are incompatible and invalid on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The only shitforks I use are the ones that Trezor implemented (Bcash and Bgold).. Other than that I can‘t get bothered to extract my private keys, send my BTC to new wallets, install the shitfork wallet etc. Way too much hassle for the useless trash that keeps getting forked off. My time is more valuable.

Yeah, I also noticed that some older people who grew up with Commodore 64s and PCs often know a lot more about computers than younger ones who only ever used smartphones. That's why I think David Braben did such a great thing with the Raspberry Pi - to bring back programming and tweaking operating systems back into schools and peoples lives.

Yes, there are many of those. Bitcoin Dark, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Red, Bitcoin Private, Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin God, Bitcoin Cash... they‘re all useless. Buy BTC and hodl. Don‘t get distracted by altcoins and shitforks. Most of the people who create and shill for them just want your BTC.

As often, the „common“ way to talk is misleading and imprecise. The terms inflation and deflation originally referred to increase and decrease in the amount of currency in circulation. Today in economics, the increase in prices is referred to as price inflation, a decrease in prices is called price deflation. The original meaning  of rising or falling currency supply is now called monetary inflation / monetary deflation.
I don‘t like the shopping cart meme because it lacks that distinction.

Bcash just copypasted the Bitcoin Core code, deleted Segwit from it (in the most sloppy way possible) and added a broken „emergency difficulty adjustment“. I wouldn‘t call these people developers.

I agree 100% and I think it's awesome what you're doing. 
I'm 47 and heavily invested in Bitcoin and several altcoins. I notice that many here think most people involved in Bitcoin are in their 20s or something. Statistically that might be true... but the dudes who invented hashcash, bitgold, bitcoin and blockchain technology were definitely older. And: we not-so-young people with jobs can more easily afford to put a couple of hundred bucks into crypto every month, which I've been doing for three years now. I also educate a lot of younger people about crypto - they usually get it very fast and are willing to embrace the technology faster than the people of my generation I talk to.

Roger Ver and bitcoin.com are trying to prop up BCH to weaken BTC in the days and weeks before the B2X fork. Ver knows that miners will follow the market, so for B2X to be succesful he needs BTC to be weak - and he tries to use BCH to weaken BTC.

Bitcoin is not deflationary. It has decreasing inflation, which is predicatable because the supply is controlled via an algorithm. Deflation means that the amount of circulating coins decreases, which is not happening in Bitcoin.

That's right. There are 828 altcoins out there. And I ignore them all.

@_date: 2017-07-31 22:50:08
I don't need to "take" the BCH, because they will be in the split blockchain at the same addresses where my BTC are anyway. I chose to ignore them for now, because I believe that BCH will be an irrelevant altcoin and not worth the effort of sending them to an exchange for trading. If you want to stress yourself out over BCH, that's fine with me, too. I hope you can get your BTC out from Coinbase in time. You should never leave bitcoins in an exchange or wallet that you don't control the private keys for. Sorry if I came across a bit grumpy or arrogant. I wish you good luck!

The next SegWit activation period starts on July 28. Since 100% of blocks are already SegWit-blocks (because of BIP91), SegWit will lock in when that period ends two weeks later, on  August 11. After that, there is another two week period ("grace period") for SegWit to become active on August 25.
Price will increase in the years to come, when we will see amazing new technologies and applications such as Lightning Networks, Cross Chain Transactions ("atomic swaps"), pegged sidechains and decentralized exchanges - all thanks to SegWit. Be patient. The activation of Segregated Witness is a major milestone. It enables use cases for Bitcoin that will change the world.
@_date: 2017-05-19 08:14:29
I think it's pretty good tbh.
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:10:23
Guess what: SegWit is coming to Bitcoin thanks to UASF. Same as in Litecoin where miners decided to signal for SegWit when the chance for a UASF became too big for them ;-)

Yes, it's too late. But don't stress yourself out over it. Shitcoin Crash is just another altcoin. It's best to ignore it.

My BTC are all in a Trezor. So my BCH will be there, too, in case I ever want to use them. If you have more than 1 or 2 bitcoins, I recommend you use a hardware wallet such as Trezor, too. Coinbase or other online wallets / exchanges are not safe.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:18:50
Exactly. And Roger is also wrong when he says that Bitcoin is being "changed into a settlement layer" because of SegWit. Everyone can still use Bitcoin in the same way as before. SegWit enables additional protocol layers and pegged sidechains.

Bitsquare is cool, but decentralized exchanges via Lightning Networks or other state channel technologies will be far more efficient on a much bigger scale. Think decentralized Shapeshift with thousands or even millions of swaps per second.
Segwit2x is Segwit (BIP141) as it was originally intended + a 2 MB fork later on.  
Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to do Bitcoin without SegWit but with 8 MB blocks instead. And I am saying "attempt" because at this moment it is unclear how many people will mine their chain. Maybe it will fail. With a block size of 8 MB, they will be able to do a few dozen transactions per second. With SegWit and Lightning it will be possible to do millions of transactions per second.

If he was mining years ago it's possible that he solved a block and got the reward (which was 50 BTC in the first 4 years). In that case he owns 50 BTC, but he doesn't own "a miners block".

Stop the silly FUD please.  Bitcoin has scaling problems, *because* it is successful. So did the internet when people started to send emails with attachments and when they started to watch videos. 
Scaling solutions are on the way, and Bitcoin will be fine.
