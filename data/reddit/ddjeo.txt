I disagree.  Each time a block is found its an extra confirmation.  Many confirmations make the transaction further irreversible.  If you go by math, then as you get more confirmations the % chance of it being reversed trends towards 0 asymptotically.

Look this definition Luke:
Confirm - "to make firm or more firm; add strength to; settle or establish firmly"
Each confirmation you get on the network strengthens the transaction.  It adds stength to it.  Even the software and most block explorers talk of a confirmation as being everytime a transaction is verified in a block.  Even on blockchain.info it says unconfirmed until you get in a block, then it says 1 confirmation.  Why are you trying to change the nomenclature Luke? Isn't Bitcoin complex as it is?  Call it a SuperConfirmation then if you want to change definitions of things.
Also why downvote me?  Votes aren't even visible or count here, and now I have to wait 10 minutes just to post.

Lol, same as the confusion was when people used the decimal system instead of tonal system right? Because your contrarian way is always best Luke.  Guess what we have 10 fingers.

The other day you even told some newbie that their wallet.dat file is their "private key", you really like to change definitions around and confuse people.

Not quite, usually confirmation is considered the first time that it is accepted into a block.  It has been said that waiting 6 confirmations is safest of course, but hardly 6 confirmations = 1 confirmation
