Fair enough.  I use bittorrent sync with encfs, but if someone is savvy enough they could run the open source [owncloud]( on their own servers.  Any other recommendations?

I'd join a subreddit if you were a mod of a subreddit specifically made for your project.  You can utilize reddit's wiki system as well.

Some encfs implementations don't encrypt the file names by default like the free version of [Boxcryptor]( which is why I don't use it anymore.
@_date: 2013-02-28 17:08:09
I haven't tried that.
@_date: 2013-02-27 10:12:04
I'd consider this post to be similar to those other posts that say "Let's get so and so to accept bitcoin"
CyanogenMod is a popular enough entity for people to care to donate to.  I saw Bitcoin as a perfect use case for them to collect donations.  If they can be persuaded to use it, hopefully other popular projects would follow their lead in the future.
Using coinapult is like using the bitcointip bot to tip someone who doesn't have a bitcoin wallet yet.  It may get them interested in learning more about bitcoin which is good for the community.

Here's a tip to get the $5/month fee waived.  If you use your card thirty times during the month, you don't have to pay the maintenance fee.  What I've been doing is emailing myself two separate $0.15 Amazon gift cards every morning until I get 30 transactions. Takes about 2 weeks.  It's been working out great.
**Caution: Do not attempt to purchase all thirty separate $0.15 Amazon gift cards all in one day.  Amazon will automatically lock you out of your account because it'll flag your account as compromised.**
