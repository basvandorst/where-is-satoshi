Your last statement sums up my thoughts on every other comment I read on here. People in general really are bad at analyzing human behavior.

Journalists quote things out of context all the time. He never explicitly mentions the word bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:28:25
It's absolutely not at all. It's very telling. Clearly you've never been interviewed by a journalist. It happens much more often than you think.

Did it take a while for your withdrawal to be processed internally?
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:47:22
hey, mine just went through!
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:10:43
Yes, I was just about to make a post about this. First my email confirmations wouldn't do anything when I clicked on the link so I disabled that feature temporarily. Now my withdrawal is stuck on Waiting to Be Processed. Any updates?

I've been using bitcoins for a while now, but used all mine to buy ahem...things before the bubble started. But I plan on investing a large part of my savings into it. Despite the current bubble, now that bitcoins have national press, I think this market is going to steadily rise and I'm glad to join it relatively early!

I'm curious why he wouldn't give text message screenshots, however easy they may be to fake. Why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2013-07-31 15:25:54
Why did you delete the text messages?!!?
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:42:38
So true!

Guys this is serious. I just hope bitcoin doesn't choke up on the Senate Floor.

Uh yeah. I'm still waiting for this discrepancy to be cleared up.
