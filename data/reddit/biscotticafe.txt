We will be using Coinbox - It appears to be the simplest and most secure bitcoin POS system I have managed to find.
You still retain full control of your wallet and private key etc
If you can't find it on the Google Play store (I'm not sure if it shows up yet) send me a PM and i'll flick you the link.

We are a small, independent coffee shop and cafe located in Raine Square on the Ground floor of the new BankWest (oh the irony!) building.
As of this week, we will also be accepting payment in Bitcoin using the Coinbox app POS system.
All bills settled with Bitcoin will receive a 5% discount.
We look forward to meeting some local bitcoin enthusiasts and we're more than happy to have a chat and help you get started in accepting BTC at your own business!

Sorry mate! :( 
Don't worry though, the rest of the staff at Biscotti will be up to speed with the bitcoin POS over the next day or two. 
I hope you can call back in soon!

Biscotti uses 5 Senses coffee beans - freshly roasted weekly. I'd recommend giving one of the single origin coffees a try (they vary weekly-ish) The cafe manager and head Barista, Alex, (formerly of Lemon Lane Claremont, and Miss Kitty's Saloon Inglewood) will whip you up the best coffee in Perth! 
They also do cold drip coffee too which is awesome over ice on these crazy hot Perth days!

Yeah mate it's all sorted now :) All staff will know how to use it by the end of the week. Hope to see you soon. Cheers

Cheers! I Hope to see a few more Perth places pop up on coinmap soon. We're having a meeting with some other Perth business owners/managers tomorrow night to discuss our experiences and options with btc payments.

We will reconcile the till at COB each day with the AUD equivalent of Bitcoin transactions.

Might want to wait til the morning mate, Alex is out for the afternoon on business and he has the POS tablet...
