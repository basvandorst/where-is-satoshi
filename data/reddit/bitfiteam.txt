Coinbase controls your money. When you put money in Bitfi wallet only you control your money. Why do you position yourself like some kind of expert when you have no clue whatsoever what you are talking about?

Hi BaBaGucci,
The typo you are talking about on the website never exposed anyone to any risk whatsoever and private key were not and could not ever be exposed because the Bitfi wallet is the only device on the market that does not store private keys - anywhere - EVER. That is precisely what makes it unhackable - because there isn’t anything to hack. This technology is radically different from anything else on the market. With Bitfi, all private keys are always stored in the users brain and so until people learn to read minds it is impossible to access any users private keys. Unlike all other wallets that are storage devices, the Bitfi wallet is a powerful computing device. We encourage to take a moment to learn more about how it works. This is a major, major breakthrough and will change many people’s lives and in turn drive adoption and higher prices for cryptocurrency, which is our core mission. We invite all comments and questions which we will gladly answer here.

Dear Spartacus,
Please note that we DO NOT recommend a 5 word phrase. We recommend a 7 word phrase like LazyHairTurnsGreenWhenIEatStrawberries. We provide two methods to set phrase, either one that is completely your own or by rolling the included die to create complete randomness and then memorize the 7 randomly generated words. The difference between 5 words and 7 words for brute force entry is massive. As we describe in our FAQ it would take an attacker 27 million years (assuming his machine can do 1 trillion guesses per second and can run 24/7) to guess a 7 word phrase created with random words. A 5 word phrase offers exponentially lower protection although it would still be almost impossible to break into your wallet because the attacker would also need to associate your phrase with specific public addresses which is practically impossible.
Anyway, we advertise that the device is completely and totally unhackable and John McAfee stated for the first time in his life that a technology is unhackable. In order for it to deliver on the advertised claim, you must follow the secret phrase setting guidelines in the Quick Start Guide.
Please let us know if you have any questions!

The Bitfi wallet is completely open source. Whoever here is spreading false information needs to take a few minutes to learn about the tech.

And what is wrong with BIP32?

You don’t know anything.

Hello Fatvod,
Our developers will add a downloadable program that allows private key generation on btknox.org in the next week or so. We are trying to provide in a format that usable and user friendly so that anyone can generate their private keys from their phrase. Please check back in about a week. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:54:48
Hi Fatvod, you can access the key generation software and the algorithm on btknox.org
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:08:11
Yes. We are looking for someone extremely knowledgeable in airdrops and forks and everything associated with ERC20 tokens and the process of converting some of them to mainnet. Please spread the word and email resume or description about yourself to support

Hi Copacertrix, please go to btknox.org there you will find emergency key generation software and the algorithm (will require you to do a bit of math to turn it into code) 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:25:25
We never said we were providing full open source code. We clearly state that our wallet is open source. Just check our website before you spew garbage. But if you want the code, do some math. Don’t be lazy.

Hi BaBaGucci,
The Bitfi algorithm is open source code that is to be used in the event of some emergency in case a user cannot obtain a replacement Bitfi device. There would have been no possibility of phishing attack because no users have yet created phrases.
On the subject of private keys, indeed every single hardware wallet on the market keeps your private keys on a microchip inside the device. If this device is seized, lost, or stolen then someone could obtain the private keys (which is not possible with the Bitfi wallet because it is not a storage device). The paper back-up you are talking about is the mnemonic seed used to restore your wallet, which is another security problem. The Bitfi wallet does not require this paper back-up. Storing this piece of paper is no different than keeping a stack of $100 bills under your mattress. So we created the Bitfi wallet because there had to be a better way. 
It is not at all an SD card of any kind. It is a computing device that calculates your private keys from your secret phrase. This is why the private keys are now always stored in your brain. In other words, this is completely different technology and huge leap in security. The security with the Bitfi wallet is absolute - which cannot be said about any other form of storage.

Hi Fatvod,
Of course this will also be available on GitHub shortly in the format you are looking for. Thank you,
