Unrealized gain in my opinion.
An unrealized gain is a profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment. It is a profitable position that has yet to be sold in return for cash, such as a stock position that has increased in capital gains but still remains open. A gain becomes realized once the position is closed for a profit.
A strong argument could be made that a fork or even an air-drop of a token might actually be an attack on a holders position instead of a gain.
How many people have lost crypto while mishandling coins or downloaded malicious software hoping to get in or get out of the next fork or airdrop?
How do I know that a fork is legitimate or not?
If I refuse to download a fork, will the IRS want me to claim a loss on abandoned property every time that happens? Who's to say someone just doesn't announce a thousand forks and we end up spamming the tax collector with useless data.

I went three years without calculating fees. I treated crypto like stock so I always declared gains (fortunately no losses yet) for trades. Since I traded so infrequently I'm pretty sure every one has been with advantage of 12 months hold - though I have not calculated this year yet. So I am going to go back and audit myself for three years (which is also max I can file an amended return so it's time) using  making sure I did all my first-in-first-out's accurate and also including Fees I left out if I can find them. They don't fees  easy to find at some exchanges.
Another thing, I filed some FBAR's though I can't say if anyone else should do it. I just want to make it obvious that I am transparent and compliant.
My wish is for government to become just as compliant to its citizens as citizens are to government - trust is a two way street.

The goal of bitcoin is that the quality of life will be better for everyone so you have not missed the boat.

If I recall, my tech-fu is limited, when you 'check-in' with the Ledger servers your device is 'verified' with a hard coded private key pair and I'm not sure if Ledger can discern your device from hundreds of others manufactured in that 'batch' or not.
Looking for correction if wrong.

Found it, this is what I was trying to explain:
So not 'the servers' but the chrome application. But I'm surprised if the chrome app is holding all of those embedded private keys from different batches? It is my understanding that Ledger hosts a bitcoin node. Refreshing my knowledge...
"The Ledger Wallet Chrome application sends a random value to the Nano as a challenge. The Nano then signs this random value + the firmware version, using an embedded private key shared by some batches."

My issue was that I should not be incentivized to take a (potentially) malicious fork because I am responsible for taxes just because some new token has been air-dropped on me. 
Personally I'm counting cost as zero with its creation date as August 1, 2017 so I'll have to wait a year to benefit from LT gains. (edit 1) Are you saying that you view the age of the forked coin as the same as the age of your original coin? (edit 2) nm, i see your reply to acameric above and I also will check to verify.
I will likely list forked coins as 'deferred income' that may never receive if I recall according to that link but I don't have my notes with me and have not cleared it with accountant. With all the alt-coins and this new air-drop trend there's no telling what token has been assigned or offered to me.

When you are on stuck on the outside you must have faith in 'them'.
When everyone is allowed inside you only need faith in 'us'.

I understood that if you treat it as a split you would have to pay taxes now. Any stocks splits I ever dealt with were behind a 401k or an IRA so I never gave taxes a thought.
If you do treat it as a split, my understanding is that they are short term capital gains so it seems to me or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:28:37
I am following the reasoning laid out in the bitcoin tax blog post.

With the persistence of the BCH fork and a commitment to large blocks it seems logical that BTC should concentrate on their layer 2 solutions and even smaller blocks. Luke_jr's suggestion of block size at 360k seems to me like it would be suitable for ham radio relay. At this point, I'm looking at BTC as something like NIST Internet Time server.
I was against small blocks until BCH provided a solution and I'd like to see core succeed with smaller blocks. Being able to sync up to the blockchain via satellite and perhaps even some day ham radio gives BTC a global reach.
There's about a half-dozen large value money transmitters in the world, there may eventually be dozens or even a hundred corporate or government blockchains as well as merchant and even charitable lightning channels/chains and they will all need to publish some checkpoint hash to an agnostic blockchain that is accessible regardless of borders and BTC serves that role.
BCH should continue to experiment with larger blocks. There is plenty of room for both BTC and BCH to succeed and I hope that development teams can now focus on progress instead of fighting.

Or a meme!
A fallen leader, Jamie Dimon banished from the halls of Bitcoin venture capitalists finds himself wandering the desert with a great thirst.
Breaking the horizon formed by dunes, we see a great knight upon a stallion waiving a scimitar revealed to be Prince Alwaleed - "I'll save you Jamie! Show me the beast!"
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:29:49
Could this be the Prince offering to take 'the heat' off of Jamie Dimon as a friendly gesture?
Also, the Prince is looking to monetize Twitter and SnapChat and he's probably jealous of what Bitcoin is doing to social media.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:54:28
Theory: Dimon is doing all he can to delay bitcoin because he faces a daunting task when customers demand to see the chain of custody on everything from financial documents. Transparency and AI scrutiny is not his friend.

I've been w/ coinbase since 2012 and from my casual following of coinbase news it seems that most anyone who has lost their coins from coinbase has been due to what is best described as some sort of identity theft.
The fact is that they do not have a brick and mortar building where we can meet a teller face to face, so we have to use login credentials. As far as I know, the only people who have ever lost money from coinbase are those who have had their login credentials stolen either by email and phone hacking or computer hacking.
Even there, you can protect yourself more by using Coinbase Vault feature where it delays release of funds for, if i recall, 3 days and it must be confirmed that you want them released using multiple emails.
Also, i believe they are enforcing 2fa and forbid SMS which is about the best anyone can do.
The weak point in Coinbase security, sorry for this long answer... is likely either your phone or your computer.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:58:23
The best way to ask this question (in my opinion) is: 
Are my login credentials to Coinbase protected from takeover and if they are taken over how long will it take an attacker to empty my account?

send a very small test transaction to it. Enough so that you are not angry if it gets lost.
RESET the device.
Recreate the settings by using the 24 words and see if your test transaction is there.
You are basically asking us 'what is a good nights sleep not worrying about the ability to recover my wallet worth?'
Personally, i prefer a goods night sleep over worry.

Namecoin deserved mention at least based on age and some other firsts and was released on bitcoin block 19200 which was sometime June 2011, five months earlier than Litecoin.
