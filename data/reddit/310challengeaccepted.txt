In my defense I do, registered specially for this thing, hence the name but it's my only active account

I am not getting that result, I am probably doing something wrong...   
Creating a bitstring of 2800bits from the LSB of the R channel of first 2800 pixels gives me something very different...  
length: 2800
first 24 bits: 101101010100011010110001
10110101 =&gt; 0xb5
01000110 =&gt; 0x46
10110001 =&gt; 0xb1
... debugging time, think I am doing something wrong maybe explains why I never can match it with any file signatures...

Please don't lock this thread! Discussions are really useful for the people making a serious attempt

Awesome, gonna check this out!

Nice! I am just back at it again, but not getting any improvement, any tips? Tried a bunch of operators, but my bit skills ain't what they should be haha

Did you find the pkzip? I am so far only able to retrieve the salted openssl string, No zip, no rar and no hidden image (with additional chars). Tried messing around a lot with all the pixel data, but so far nothing but random crap.

Also interested in this, or do you just mean the alpha channel?

Appreciated! I also just was noticing that with XOR it's negative of what I need, so flipping it seems to match the first 24 bits but file is corrupt :/
