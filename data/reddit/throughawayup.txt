He had the option in that scenario to not hire a hitman. That is all it takes for it to not be entrapment. 
In the grand scheme of things I'm on your side but making this argument is not helping our case dude. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:16:20
Autocorrect :)
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:00:32
And that's the same as hitmen?
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:16:49
Yes everything is black and white. Thanks for your valuable input. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:46:32
Delusional because the trial was horseshit?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:27:27
Drugs don't kill people and cause these issues people kill people and cause these issues. I bet you also think we should ban firearms. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:00:17
And you can say definitively he was the one using that handle at that time? 
You can prove this conversation was not manipulated?
Why did the court not convict him of this?

I thought everyone understood the sentiment behind the Silk Road. Apparently not. Glad to have given you another perspective!

Biggest piece of evidence in his favor besides the corrupt agents. No deaths could be attributed to these "hits."
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:08:20
Dude get off your high horse. I have personal experience with drug addicts who I'm actually friends with or I was friends with. I don't need to volunteer at a rehab clinic to know and understand the horrors of drug addiction. Saying all drugs should be illegal is not a practical solution to the problem and we both have evidence for that.

Say what you will about the ethics of running this website, but for one thing he was absolutely the fall guy no doubt about it and two, consecutive life sentences is absolutely uncalled for. Rapists and murders don't even get those charges. 
Edit: look I'm not saying he was the most upstanding citizen. I'm not saying he was a good or a bad person. The DPR handle could have been used by any number of people besides him. He took the blame either rightly so or not. His sentencing based on CONVICTIONS not allegations, was too harsh. That is all I'm attempting to say. As far as the hitman allegations go I believe that there is room for discussion as to whether or not those actually took place specifically by him, by someone else, were fabricated, etc. The corruption in this case by federal agents really only leads to people questioning whether or not everything else was done by the book. 
I'm not trying to defend him or damn him, I'm just trying to look at it objectively. 
And yes of course rapists and murders get those charges but it's also common for them to not get two consecutive life sentences. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:41:00
Okay...irrelevant to the discussion at hand though.

I think peer reviewed drug purchases are much safer than in real life drug deals where you can be robbed with a deadly weapon or assaulted or sold drugs that are not peer reviewed and are therefore more likely to be mislabeled and therefore dangerous. 
Doing drugs is inherently unsafe of course. I'm not arguing against that point. But the methods this website and others continue to employ are infinitely safer than other methods of obtaining drugs. If you think otherwise you simply don't have experience with it and can't make an accurate unbiased assessment.

He was never convicted of murder. At least keep up with what actually happened if you're going to make assertions. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:05:16
The government did not force him to hire a hit. I agree that what they did was wrong but it is not by definition entrapment. 
Entrapment is when someone forces you to make a decision you normally wouldn't. He was not forced to hire a hit. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:45:38
He wasn't entrapped. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:32:16
Lol just because he was logged into an account does not prove he was the only operator of that account. I'm not even trying to say that there were necessarily multiple operators of DPR but to think that it's an impossible scenario is short sighted. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:28:20
Once again the DPR handle allegedly commissioned the hits. That doesn't necessarily mean that Ross was the one who commissioned the hits. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:56:30
This is obviously speculation on my part but the way this reads is so robotic and...I hate to use this word here but scripted. It doesn't sound like two people conversing in a normal fashion especially as they would about killing people?
Also why would an admin order a hit on a scammer? Yeah he's "tainting" your market but at that point you're just getting your hands dirty for the sake of pride. No person in this position would have enough confidence to start ordering hits on people just because they're scamming users. On markets today these things happen and no one is killed. It's part of business. It's tainting the scammer and associates not the market or its admin. It's just silly that he would do this. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:08:04
The comment my op was in reply to stated that he made a website where people could hire hitmen. I stated that was not the case. How is bringing up that weapons were sold relevant to my objection the a post about hitmen being available for hire? It's not. These are two different products/services and I did not object that guns were sold on that marketplace. 
Your comment was irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:12:26
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:16:33
Reread where I said I'm not trying to damn him or adore him. I never called him a saint or implied that he was a good person. At least have some reading comprehension skills if you're going to make a snarky comment. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:08:12
So why is segwit preferred over increasing the block sizev
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:18:43
Okay dude. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:26:00
Neither of us know what we believe to be true is actually true. I was simply defending myself because I never called him a saint as you said I did. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:30:02
Some people make him out to be a martyr. I am not one of those people and my comment never suggested that I am of that opinion. 
The two things I said were: 
He was the fall guy and
His sentence was over the top. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:26:06
This is a wild misconception played up heavily by the media. You clearly never visited the website. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:35:02
Dude I'm pretty sure most people aren't condoning his actions. My original comment simply asserted that I believe he was a fall guy and that his sentence was too harsh for the crimes he was convicted of. Would it be too harsh had he been convicted of the crimes he was alleged to commit? Probably not. 
Regardless, i and others are not asserting he was a "good guy" or a "bad guy."
