Oh God how ignorant can they be about money not being something on screens? That's not how banking systems work at least in both the US and Canada... Banks are actually allowed to lend out more than they can liquidate. That's right everybody. The banks are getting rich off of Interest of money that they lend out that they can't actually liquidate if people need money in its physical form
Well your co-workers may be naive and or ignorant, you don't have to blast them so hard. Best to not be negative about things, unless you know, you're just taking out your frustrations from the drop?

I don't see what that has to do with making absolute assumptions along the lines of only one type of people selling
It's Christmas. People are probably cashing out and using their games to buy presents can't turn right

Would you be surprised to know that not everybody who sold is going to be the same type of person? I wouldn't be surprised if there were people who bought it ages ago, we're hoping it was going to go up and up and up, saw it going down, and still cashed out with a huge Profit. Just not as big as they were hoping for.

You guys need to learn a better way of telling inside jokes. Apples aren't finite is a long stretch from there being excess supply... There can be an excess supply of something that is finite... the best inside jokes don't require telepathy. 
You're also a little bit behind the times. They did print money back when we were having world wars but these days the government borrows money and pays interest 4 budgets like military.
While printing money does have an impact on inflation, it happens a lot less than you would expect. Other factors such as interest rates, minimum wage, and Market fluctuations in supply and demand affect inflation. Inflation is calculated based on a common basket of goods which your typical individual or family would purchase as wants or needs.
While there is a finite supply of Bitcoin and similar currencies, it is not exempt from the forces of the economy with which it deals. As soon as enough people start wanting to cash out of the growing value and it hits a turning point, the value will drop. When things, even currencies, so fast, people who are looking at purchasing them start paying less and less. Also one cryptocurrency might have a finite Supply, but when you have other cryptocurrencies popping up now and becoming popular... Overall cryptocurrencies can be seen as having the same problem as regular currencies. At least in terms of their being a finite Supply, when new cryptocurrencies are being created before all the finite supply of the current ones have even been mined yet

Restricting the supply artificially is the best way to describe the current state of economies all over the world. Economies which made sense when resources were scarce.
Have you read Ishmael by Daniel Quinn by any chance? Great book

Tell that to the homeless who have banks and the economy standing in between them and unused homes
I'm sure they'll respond " we don't want to live in those, they're worthless due to excess Supply."
People eat fruit. And it's not worthless because it decomposes and is reused by Nature if we don't eat it
