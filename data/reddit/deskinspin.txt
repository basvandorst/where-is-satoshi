This is dangerous. According to Salt, [you still own your btc]( meaning that [if it goes up in value, you can loan more]( But if it goes down you can get [margin called](
What people are going to do is lend out their bitcoin, get money, buy more bitcoin, lend out that bitcoin, get money, buy more bitcoin, lend out that bitcoin, ... and on and on. Essentially the same as what happened in the housing bubble; taking out equity on your home, use as down payment for another home, home prices increase due to high demand, taking out equity on your home, use as down payment for another home, ....

And that's exactly why I sold most of my btc (and even more of my btrash) early to mid december when the price went nuts, realizing more than 100x my initial investment. I lived through such a bubble before (late 2013) and I knew what was coming. This decline has nothing to do with Korea's ban or China's ban on mining or any of that, although many people will dispute that. I think it's just a hype and all hypes come to an end.
But I also want to point out that there will come a time that we set a final ATH. There is absolutely no way that we increase by a factor of 10 every few years. The math on that doesn't work out, because pretty soon the market cap will have to exceed other things like gold, then the stock market, then the whole derivatives market and then all wealth on earth.

The hash rate of the network is ~1.5e19 hashes/second. There's a 12.5 btc (1.25e9 satoshis) reward about every ten minutes. So it takes 10 * 60 * 1.5e19 = 1.9e23 hashes to earn 1.25e9 satoshis. 1.9e23 / 1.25e9 = 1.52e14 hashes/satoshi. That's 152 trillion.

We sign a contract in which I promise to give you 1 btc in exchange for $17500 on jan 17 2018. We agree beforehand that I'm not actually going to give you bitcoin, but we are just going to settle the difference in cash. So I pay you $1 for every dollar over $17500, and you pay me $1 for every dollar under $17500. That's what a cash settled future is.

Exactly, but up or down against what? Realize here that there will be different prices. The bitcoin price (also called the spot price, the price you see on a btc exchange), and the price at the CME in the futures market representing the future price. They will be different.


The result of a lot of people shorting would be that the futures price drops, not the spot price (at least not directly). If we take our previous example, that would mean that we were betting about how much it will differ from $5k dollars, instead of betting about the current spot price (~11.3k). You could say that that means that the wall street predicts that in 6 months the price will be $5k. Wall street is just not always right, but it could be seen as an indicator, which would have an indirect effect on the spot price.

We agree that for every dollar under 10k on 4th of june you pay me a dollar and for every dollar above 10k on the 4th of june I pay you a dollar. That is essentially what a future settled in cash is; a side bet. Nobody bought or sold any bitcoin.

No, maybe personally, but at least not in the context of the futures.


Futures are just buy contracts for a certain commodity for a certain point in the future. So, for instance you can buy a contract for 1 btc on june 1st 2018 for $9.5k. If bitcoin is the same (11.3k) on june 1st 2018 you will have "bought" 1 bitcoin worth ~11.3k, with a profit of 1.8k. The other person who sold you the contract will have lost 1.8k. That difference will be settled in cash. No bitcoin is every bought or sold, hence it should (EDIT:) *not* directly influence the price of bitcoin. Indirectly, the futures price can set an indication of price for the "physical" btc market.
With agricultural commodities futures make sense, as a farmer can sell his crop in the form of futures before even planting the seeds, effectively insuring his investment against a drop in price. With bitcoin, this is just ordinary speculation.

I was there. 
This subreddit was aware that something was going on on mt.gox several weeks before it became public they where hacked. People here were suspicious and advising others to take their money/btc out.
I think after peaking at around $1100, people were actually pretty positive. There was a state of denial. [Sparta HODL memes]( were rampant, but they didn't help.
At the bottom (late 2014), there was desperation. People were saying thing along the lines of "bitcoin was a good idea, but will probably fail". 
Basically what [this chart]( says is completely true for the hype of late 2013 and subsequent slump of 2014.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:56:48
Yes, I thought it was actually ~90%. But if you held your money in a bank you still would have gained in purchasing power due to receiving interest every year. If you receive on average more in interest than you lose in inflation you still gain in purchasing power. For instance, in 1980 inflation was 13-14%, but interest rates got as high as 21%. Then you don't have to complain about holding fiat.

Simple: the price of bitcoin goes up.
You are confusing money with value. If a government issues money, as a whole we don’t get richer. Each dollar/euro just loses value. In the opposite case where money is destroyed, said money gains in value, such that the total value (of in this case bitcoin) remains the same.

@_date: 2017-12-04 17:24:07


You are confusing options and futures. An option is the right to buy (long, call), the right to sell (long, put), the obligation to sell (short, call) or the obligation to buy (short, put) at a predetermined price. A future is the right to receive (long) or the obligation to deliver (short) the commodity ~~that is already paid for by the future itself~~. A future is just a buy contract with a delivery date in the future.
EDIT: I should add that I assumed that entering a future means that you put down they money. This is commonly required by brokers (at least in part, depending on allowed margin), but not required by exchanges. The buyer also has the obligation to pay, which has been done at least in part when trading through a broker. The seller has the right to receive his money, obviously.

People used to accept some inflation because if they put their money in the bank they would get interest that generally was greater than the inflation. It's not *just* about the inflation rate. It's about the difference between inflation rates and interest rates. If you get 0.25% interest on your money and 1.5-2% inflation, the math is pretty clear.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:04:09
I think the reason to allow futures and not etf’s is solely for the purpose of price suppression. ETF’s would actually need to buy bitcoins from the market, while futures won’t as they likely will be settled in cash for the most part. The result is that speculative money on bitcoin won’t actually buy bitcoin. Also, wall street might try its hand at short term price manipulation at times btc is thinly traded in order to rake in money on the futures.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:30:00


When you buy with margin, you loan money and buy actual bitcoin with it. A futures contract is just a bet against someone else, without buying actual bitcoin.
Let suppose you and I enter a bet about the price of bitcoin. You think it will go higher than $17500 by jan 17 2018, I think it will go lower. We sign a contract in which I promise to give you 1 btc in exchange for $17500 on jan 17 2018. We agree beforehand that I'm not actually going to give you bitcoin, but we are just going to settle the difference in cash. So I pay you $1 for every dollar over $17500, and you pay me $1 for every dollar under $17500. That's what a cash settled future is.

No, you **aren't buying a contract** to buy or sell at a fixed price. By entering a futures contract you are making the purchase itself (or sale in case of short) with a delivery date in the future.


That's the legal definition of a purchase agreement with a future delivery date.
Take the example of buying a house:
- future: Contract which will state a date of the key transfer somewhere in the future and date of payment. The "future" contract is the purchase agreement. The price ~~of~~ on the future is the price ~~of~~ on the contract as they are the same thing.
- option: You pay the seller a sum of money (premium) much smaller than the value of the house, which will give you the right to purchase it at a predetermined price at some fixed date in the future. The current owner of the house is allowed to keep the premium in any event. You as a buying can later choose to buy or not to buy the house. The price of the option is the price of the premium. The price of the house specified in the option will need to be in the purchase agreement. The purchase agreement is separate from option.

I think a lot of people are surprised that the price of bitcoin has risen to $12.5k this year. That's what the bitcoin market does; it surprises people, both to the upside as well as to the downside.


Investors just raise the price, but do not change the fundamentals. The higher the price goes the riskier it gets. Something that is up 10 times is 10 times as risky, assuming fundamentals don't really change that much. So the fact that there are more investors now is just a negative.

The pros: You could make a lot of money.
The cons: You could lose a lot of money.
Honestly, I think we have entered a manic phase. At this point the price is just going up because people are trying to get in on the action. Or can someone give some good reasons why people are desperate to get in at $4000, when nobody was getting in at say $450 a little over a year ago? What has changed in order to warrant a 10x price increase?
So what I would do :
Buy [regular dollar amounts of bitcoins every month]( Divide the amount of what you want to spend on bitcoin over a couple of years. And don't spend more on bitcoin than you are willing to lose. Only spend part of your money on bitcoin and use the rest to invest in a more sane and responsible manner or spend it on yourself. Take a vacation or buy a new car. Don't go all in on bitcoin. Don't get greedy.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:49:10


If I had say $100k I would reserve no more than $10k for bitcoin. If you lose it all it's "only" 10% of your money. If it rises a lot, it really doesn't matter wether you put in $10k or $100k. Divide $10k over 24 months is about $415 a month.
That's just what I would do, but you'll have to make decisions for yourself.


I created a self optimizing algorithm based on moving averages. I never used it with actual bitcoins, but in simulation it did make good money. I never used it with real bitcoin, because it was missing some safeguards and btc-e was the only exchange with low enough fees and I didn't trust them, with good reason. But this was years ago when you could easily outsmart other bots. Now that's probably *a lot* harder.

I would recommend selling. Not because you made a mistake, but because if even a 5% change in the value can apparently make you question your decisions, a 50% (or more!) drop will make you miserable. Being happy is worth more than some bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-08-14 21:04:09
I'm talking like 4 years ago with prices around $100. It just checked whether a short term moving average crossed a long term moving average and would buy/sell accordingly. It had an algorithm that optimized the parameters for the moving averages. I think it mainly worked because it would optimize at slightly tighter parameters than what the "big guys" with their bots where using.
But I did learn that the biggest/fastest moves in price are often spurred by bots, most of the time because a certain moving average would cross another. Pretty simple. And if you get your algorithm a little tighter it's like stealing candy from a baby. But again: I don't think that would work anymore these days.

If you plan to buy stuff with it a hardware wallet could be practical. It depends on how much you have. It wouldn't make sense to buy a $100 hardware wallet if you have say $200 in bitcoin. If you have a significant amount in btc, another options is to split it and keep the bulk in "cold storage" and the rest in your encrypted electrum wallet.

All these posts today about people who bought in today have been driving me mad. Keep buying btc at an ATH sheeple.
EDIT: I'm saying is the get-rich-quick guy. If he bought btc in 2011 and held on to them then buying btc today would be like carrying coals to Newcastle.

I was thinking of the ledger nano s, so you confused me with the passphrase.
EDIT: but how are you going to enter a superlongandsecurepassphrase on a tiny device such as a hardware wallet?

10-20% isn't what I was talking about. I mean a 50-80% correction. Some people might call that a crash.

You need to stop and think why you didn't feel this way about bitcoin a few months ago at $3k. Are you wanting to buy just out of FOMO (fear of missing out)? That's usually a sign that something is in a bubble. "Dumping a bunch of money" into a bubble is a bad strategy.
Sell when there's euphoria (aka now), buy when people are desperate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:43:52


Don't decrypt them and use multiple backups. And the fact that your keys are never exposed doesn't matter if someone has physical access to your hardware wallet. Also, you'd need to somehow be able to recover from a broken hardware wallet (using a seed, which you need to store somewhere), which is a security risk as anyone who has the seed can recreate your private key.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:36:54
If this surge is like 2013 it could "correct" to ~$2500
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:44:27
Oh, ok. A lower price would not be a bad thing. It's getting a bit ridiculous right now.

Just like 2013. Seriously, if you didn't hear about bitcoin in 2013 in the media you weren't paying attention.

We are operating under the assumption that your pc is compromised. Otherwise stealing something from someone's computer would be very difficult. Time to learn about keyloggers my friend.


That makes it even easier to lose your bitcoin. So, you need to store that seed somewhere. There's the weak point. The seed is as good as the private key. You at best end up at the same level of security as I use, except about 80 euro's lighter, a more complex system and with a false sense of security.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:22:10
How do you know it didn't drop in valuation at some point before it IPO'ed? It's pretty likely that it did.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:06:56
And they are the group that buy at a ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:08:42


Mostly this. OP could have bought most of his btc years ago, but the fact that he's still buying now when he's already that deep just shows a lack of financial literacy. You are supposed to decrease your risk as you get more money and you get older, not increase it by buying more.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:42:28
HDD mostly. I don't want to rely on USB (cheap flash memory) for long term storage. And you need to back up your pc anyway, so you can kill two birds with one stone. (pc backup on large partition, btc on small partition)
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:53:44
Why not? It was only a little over two months ago that it was $5k.

I've never understood the point of a hardware wallet. It's a single point of failure. If your hardware wallet dies, it's bye bye bitcoin.
Personally I just use hard drive backups (plural!) with gpg (symmetrically) encrypted private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:35:57
I think the same. The parallels with 2013 when it broke $1000 are obvious. Same price action, same attitude and reasoning of people in this sub.
btw, it went to $1100, then went down to ~$250.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:30
Use multiple hard drives with *encrypted* backups of your private key. Store them in different places (home/family/friends/safe deposit box). You can use those drives to backup your pc too (which you should be doing anyway).

They could take pieces of paper and write words on it.

Because there are a lot of people in this sub right now who bought above $5k and they are jealous.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:20:23
I have had a few discussions today on wether or not a hardware wallet is a good idea. My opinion (which is not the opinion of most others) is that it does **not** provide better security than a proper (redundant) encrypted backup if your intent is to use it as a cold storage. Storing your bitcoin in electrum on your daily use pc may not be the best idea. A hardware wallet is (in my view) a compromise between being able to do transactions (without going through the hassle of taking coins out of cold storage), while maintaining a reasonable level of protection against your pc being compromised.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:27:01
Sorry, but you aren't going to make money on mining bitcoin. In 6-7 months time the [network's hash rate]( will be around 3-5 times what it is now. Because your mining income is inversely proportional to the network's hash rate, by that time you'll probably be losing money just running your hardware as the cost of electricity exceeds your income from mining. You are in a race against time that you can't win.
EDIT: and we are talking bitcoin, not altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:46:48
Uhm, the intention of these ads is to drive **up** the price because:
- more visibility for bitcoin
- the idea that investors are buying a lot of bitcoin, causing FOMO.
- Causing a sense of having privileged knowledge, causing people to think they are betting on a sure thing.

What it means is that you got screwed because you trusted another party with your coins.

Indeed. I wouldn’t be surprised to see $3k during the next few months.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:06:09
It's just like black friday. First increase the price by 1000%, then decrease it by 15% and voilà, it's a SALE!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:01:19
Late 2013 it went from $100 to $1100. People where having all the same arguments about how it was going up further and where getting all-in, some even taking out equity on their homes. During 2014 it came down 80% from the 2013 highs and some people got forced out of the market (because there where underwater) and many others sold out of fear. The end of the story is that people bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:08
Nah, not zero. We will take a break at $8000, recover a bit, then go down further toward $3000 during the next few months. At least that's what happend after the $1100 bubble popped (but this time at 10x the price).

The problem is that that is easier said than done. The people who bought because the price was going up are the one who'll sell because the price is going down. They will create some kind of rationale to justify it, but it's what they will do.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:05
That kind of stuff reminds me of mt gox.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:57:18
No, it won't get through. Transaction fees [right now]( are around 140 sat/byte. The transaction will only be confirmed if the fee is high enough, as miners prioritize transactions with higher fees per byte to maximize profits. They work from high fee density to low. If a transaction is not confirmed within about 48 hours it will be dropped. Hence my remark about noobs.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:14:04

Has been happening for a while. The most common thing I've heard is people getting their unencrypted wallets (stupid!) stolen and malware that changes public addresses in your clipboard. So you copy a public address of someone you want to send money to, but when you paste that in your client it has been changed to the attackers address. Always double check the address you send btc to!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:56:38
I'm definitely not a shitcoiner. Bitcoin is the only crypto I've ever bought (and I'm still hodling). Just been around long enough to know better than to expect that bitcoin will go to the moon without taking a few breaks every now and again. It has to shake out the weak hands.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:42:56
No need to wait on the sync. Just export the private keys and import them in another client like Electrum (and Electron cash for your bcash).
- menubar: help -&gt; debug window
- select the console
- type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 300
- type: dumpprivkey [your public key here]

Depends on where you live. If you have a bank account in the Netherlands you can get them in a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:11:57
But that means you have to keep your seed somewhere. That then becomes your point of failure. If anyone knows your seed he/she can steal your bitcoin.
I just don't see the benefit of a hardware wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:05:59
Using two buttons to enter a passphrase is not going to result in people actually using a secure passphrase. That leaves the seed open to a brute force attack.
EDIT: anybody with physical access (and the right resources) could clone the wallets memory (eprom or whatever it is) and get access.
That means a larger attack surface; two ways of getting compromised instead of one. Either physical access to the device and clone memory, or get access to the seed and brute force that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:31:07
Obviously don't put it online. Personally I would always encrypt it and not just depend on hiding it somewhere. If someone finds it they could steal it. And use multiple locations for your backups in case of natural disasters or fires. A WWII-era bomb shelter works nicely ;).

The lowest transaction fees currently getting through are around 150 sat/byte.

It took over 100 years to do that. I don’t know about you, but in 100 years I’ll probably be dead. And you assume you held cash, but if you held it in a bank you would have gained purchasing power, because interest rates.

A few words of advise:
- Never assume a paradigm shift on the basis of price. Has there been a change in fundamentals since it was below $4k not even 2 months ago? I don't think so. You are just acting on price. People who do that tend to lose money, as a non-yielding asset is practically a zero-sum game.
- Don't tell someone else what to do with his/her bitcoin, especially if you are the one who's new to bitcoin.

Your math is a little off if you think we can 10x into infinity.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:38:27
You will make money the first couple of months, but the hash rate of the network is going up very quickly, which bites into your profits. Every year it increases rougly 10x. Hence you will not break even on your investment, unless you have privileged access to new hardware and access to very cheap electricity.

You pay it every year. How much you pay is dependent on your net worth. First 30k is tax free, 30-100k is 0.6%, 100k-1M is 1.3%, 1M+ is 1.61% (for jan 1 2018). The advantage is you don't pay capital gains, so this tax is a lot simpler. The disadvantage is when you lose, you still owe money to the tax man.

The internet contains links to CP. The whole internet is therefore illegal.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:37:07


No I wasn't. I was making fun of the idea that anything that directs people towards CP should be made illegal. That's making fun of people like you who think that people who are critical of anything that has to do with the laws pertaining to child abuse should be shot down. "Oh, you are against the idea of banning this? You child rapist! Oh, you don't agree with this law that was intended to protect children? You must be a child molester". Meanwhile you kill all public debate around the subject, which is damaging. If you actually wan't to protect children and have sensible laws you need to start a debate, not kill it.
