Except that technically I'm not. An [exchange] ( is a place where you can swap items of equal value back and forth, whereas a [shop]( is a place for purchasing goods only, so a non-reciprocal trade as opposed to a reciprocal trade.

This just means that it has limited/simplified functionality, it's still an exchange just not what you personally are looking for.
Many people aren't seeking out a place to set up asks/bids or play the market and are simply looking for a uncomplicated and convenient entry/exit bitcoin exchange.

Because pawn is short for [pawnbroker]( and pawnbroker/pawn shops are both a place for pawning goods 
(holding an item and exchanging it for it's equivalent value over time generally with the intention of the item being returned once the loan is paid)
and selling goods 
(generally goods where the original owner was unable/unwilling to repay the loan)
to the public. So more of a hybrid store that both exchanges/holds goods and outright selling them.
I.E not a traditional exchange.

How is it not an exchange?
You give them fiat currency and they give you bitcoins, vice versa, isn't that the definition?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
