How do they withhold FICA from a Bitcoin? How do you contribute to your 401k? I have many questions and would love to know more to see if it’s possible to advise my clients on how to do the same.

Bakkt has no SEC registrations and no EDGAR filings of any kind. How did they get around this?

They’re broker-dealers and they say they’ll list many different tokens. They’re an exchange and a platform.

You should do one of these posts every time a cryptocurrency experiences this kind of volatility and see how good you feel about the implied argument that fiat currencies are going away because every now and then a currency used by less than 1% of the world's population has a bad year.

Seems like the people most desperate to validate their buying decision are those who resort to bitcoin being the failsafe in case of global economic collapse. You think there’s going to be a civilization-melting disaster and yet the massive, complex, extremely high-tech infrastructure necessary to trade bitcoin for can openers is still going to function? You can barely move a bitcoin for less than $50 in a *non-collapsed* economy.

It's a design flaw. 
A truly finite supply encourages holding and saving, not spending and using. 
There is a non-zero "burn rate" of Bitcoins that are lost in wallets whose passwords have been lost. This means that, over a sufficiently long timeline, all Bitcoins will eventually be lost to password-forgetting dopes. 
Altcoins are the inflation.

It would be impossible for every Coinbase brokerage customer to own even one of my pubes. This is why my pubes are worth thousands of dollars, while a Bitcoin is only worth one Bitcoin (and only until next year when it's worth 0.33 Bitcoin). - How this logic works

No. Lets assume that you meet all of the various residency requirements and other prima facie eligibility requirements. 
Act 22 provides exemption from: 
• 100% tax exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes on
all dividends; 
• 100% tax exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes on
all interest; and 
• 100% tax exemption from Puerto Rico income taxes on
all short-term and long-term capital gains accrued after
the individual becomes a bona-fide resident of Puerto Rico
(“Puerto Rico Gain”). 
You will be exempt from all Puerto Rico income taxes on gains made after you establish bona fide residency - which requires 183 of the year in which Puerto Rico is your genuine residence, and no other "tax home" outside of Puerto Rico during the year. 
You will not be exempt on any taxable gains you make that are eligible for US federal income tax beforehand.

Personal property is taxed as an asset. The IRS's detailed guidance on this point is even linked directly from the source you provided. [This guidance provides, in part]( 
**Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?** 
**A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.** 
Please read things before embarrassing yourself like this again.

What can I buy with Bitcoin that I can't buy with dollars? What can I buy with dollars that I can't buy with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-10-17 15:25:39
This is nonsense. You do not owe taxes on the appreciated value of the bitcoin just by moving. You realize the gain when you sell the bitcoin, not when you declare that you own it. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:17:55
The IRS currently taxes cryptocurrencies as assets. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:11:16
That is still nonsense. You don't revoke your US citizenship by moving to Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans still pay FICA, FUTA etc. US citizens are subject to the IRS no matter where they live. Puerto Rico is part of the US for IRS purposes, and even if it wasn't, you'll be filing your 2555 and your FBAR no matter where you live. Taxes are hard enough without misinformation.

Most banks don't do this. If you're so angry, why haven't you just switched banks?

[Here]( is the §5312(a) of Title 31 that is being amended. They are adding brokers and dealers "digital currency" and "any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency" to the statutory definition of "financial institutions" for purposes of the recordkeeping requirements of financial institutions. 
This is a step towards regulatory normalization. Like it or not, this is the law starting to treat virtual currency as a legitimate token of value. It is definitely NOT a ban on cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:57:03
I absolutely agree that a technologically illiterate organization like the Senate should not be doing *any* rulemaking on cryptos without much more extensive hearings from experts to make sure that they know what they're doing. I just don't think it's fair to construe this as "banning" cryptocurrencies - if anything, it's a step towards legitimization by treating them the same as any other financial institution is treated *for purposes of Title 31.*

Googling this number is interesting. Fake number for Binance. If you call it, the Indian guy who picks up just says “support,” and when I asked him from where, he said “Amazon.” 
So I hang up, and I immediately get a call that according to google is a fake number masquerading as Binance, then a call from a No Caller ID. 
Very high-effort for such a piss-poor scam, guys.

Don’t listen to this advice, PLEASE. If you make a gift over the limit YOU file the gift return and YOU pay the gift tax. Regardless of the citizenship of the foreign person. The foreign person may have their own tax implications as the recipient, but as the donor yours ARE subject to taxation.
