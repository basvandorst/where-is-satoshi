@_date: 2014-01-11 05:34:03
... Only if they admit to accepting it.  This would be motivation for businesses not to pay taxes on it, further motivation to accept it.  Grow the bitcoin economy because then there's motivation to keep it instead of trading it for USD.

This is correct.  The block chain would remain, if you have your private key inside some kind of Faraday cage then you're alright.  Otherwise the coins are lost forever. 
Though the blockchain could later be modified to make up for the lost coins, bitcoin may or may not recover depending on how many keys survived.

This.  It makes bitcoin still useful in teh US, as long as we get our coins out of the exchanges before they are shut down, we'll be fine.

Personally I expect the price to get volatile as the BTC are spent and then exchanged for fiat at exchanges and then sold back to us... 
However that means it'll actually start circulating, which should increase demand, so you'll see short term volatility, a drop as speculators jump ship, and then a sudden rise sometime around the end of next week.

ooh, that's tricky.  The original image shows a man standing, holding the constitution (to an american the constitution is almost a religiously sacrosanct document that no politician, or law can override... so think of it as a religious document representing financial and personal liberty from the perspective of an american where all Americans are assumed to believe in it almost without question) to the disapproval of the modern presidents of the united states. 
It's a way of saying that the people of the united states are capable of preserving the American way of life, and that the founding fathers (left, the picture was by a conservative artist, so the exact presidents on the conservative side, or old enough to be considered founding fathers) approve of the common man (represented by the character who is the center of the picture) standing up against the modern corruption that has overtaken the country and is threatening the modern American ideals.
When converted to the bitcoin version, it shows the older presidents (most of whom fought against holding a central bank in the united states) approving of a man standing up holding non-fiat currency as the potential way to restore the american dream while modern presidents (most of whom implemented or accepted central banking) are showing their disapproval.  The same in concept, but modified for the bitcoin community.
Does that help?

Horray for blockchain rollback.  
Real question:

To be fair, more adopters makes us richer, we really are going around promoting a ponzi-ish scheme... only it's a functional new currency that shifts in value with respect to adopters.  If we all sold bitcoins at the same  time, we'd get nothing, if we can get numerous new adopters, the price can easily inflate by a factor of 100 in 4 years.

This reminds me of interviews with soviets back during the cold war:
"See, this is the shopping mall where people buy everything they need... soap, clothes, shoes."
"Ok, but who makes the shoes if the government doesn't?"
"Well companies run by regular citizens hire other citizens to make shoes."
"Ok, so the government has companies to hire citizens"
"No no, just normal people, not the government" 
"Then who makes the shoes?"

We need 32mb at least probably which will lead to long syncing times, so either the block chain needs to be pruned, or you need to be able to sync with only the latest portion of it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:13:56
That and they'd have to recognize it as a legitimate threat which won't happen until it hits 20% or 30% market saturation.  By then it'll be too late, as the rule of networks, indicates only 10% needs to accept a change before it's inevitable.  
On top of that, wall st. will be split down the middle on BTC.  The powers that be may  not like it, but all of the smaller (read multi billion dollar) businesses will want to start using it in order to cut down on costs and enhance their own assets.  It'll be a civil war in the market, they'll likely be to paralyzed to accomplish very much.

It will be a temporary drop in 'market cap' because people calculate that by the total BTC floating around rather than active BTC.  Right now there are only around 9 million active bitcoins (we guess) the total, 12 million, indicates a full quarter may have been lost in a fashion like that which was described above.
This doesn't damage bitcoin, it does make the currency a bit more volatile for a while, and it also increases the value of all remaining active BTC

@_date: 2013-11-28 05:39:26
The amount of panic in this conversation has me concerned... I really hope BTC will succeed, but we do need to increase teh blockchain size so that we can have up to say... 70 transactions per second.  or 700... at peak times, you could assume enough people could commit transactions that it'd be 7000 transactions per second, if this becomes a global currency then such large rates are forseeable.  Yet the blockchain is what keeps this system running at all.  If a blockchain change is coming, i would suggest the dev's release an improved version such that they can run the old version up to a specific date...
a 1 month or 2 month warning before the fork would be enough so every one can be ready and roll over at the appropriate date.
.. maybe if the new version automatically changed the blockchain size at that specific date, then every one can update at their own time and then when the day rolls around, the block size will switch automatically.
@_date: 2013-10-02 22:01:49

WOW... yeah, we get shafted hard, why do you think we're all pulling out of BTC, 3.75% would be enough to override our inflation in an average year.

Infinite growth is not possible however unless either A energy becomes arbitrarily cheap, or B the use of energy in our devices becomes arbitrarily small.  
A is insane because it wont happen.  B however is possible with quantum and molecular transistors already on the horizon, it is a potential possibility particularly once we convert to purely digital beings.  However until that point, we must keep in mind finite resources when economies grow.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:59:40
... so 5 BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:09:44
you forgot the quotes
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:30:40
Can't they be worth 1,000,000 each? I like it better that way.

@_date: 2013-11-11 20:50:52
... technically speaking it CAN be... but it can also be other things... it depends on what your mathematical model is... 
does bitcoin count as a derivative of another currency?  If it's independent... hmmm...  now i'm confused.

I'd like to know if coinbase, blockchain, or any others have exclusively US servers? I'd like to place my coins in a trade-hub outside the united states because i'm getting the feeling that the banks are going to flip out pretty soon and try to come down on bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:23:16
It'll go lower.

oh, ok.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:10:34
It takes around 6 days to clear, you link it to your bank account and they do all the charging for you... but it does take a long ass time before you can make purchases, think a week or so before you can start playing with it.  When you sell though, it goes straight to your account.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:11:19
I was wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:15:58
I lost about $500 in the bear trap, but the rest i do not consider to be a loss... Just a market fluctuation with numbers on it.

If it follows mine, 'too the mun' is just the start.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:54:26
I get the impression we'll see more of these as the occasional hoarder tries a mass sell-off.

I'd have accepted "magic"
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:50:34
... is that aimed at the banks or at BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:25:15
I didn't sell in the last crash, i wont sell in this one either.

That wouldn't actually change anything, maybe increase the value.  If you buy up a lot of it and lend it, that's fine, the issue is that bitcoins can't just be created.  A bank lending bitcoins would be actually lending out real wealth that cannot be reimbursed if the loans go bad.  
With bitcoins banks can fail.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:34:45
Yeah... I feel sorry for the other subs i've left behind now browsing for nearly an hour every day exclusively.  I need to get out more.

Look at all that dirty fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:27:18
It won't damage bitcoin in the long run, and in the short term, those of us with some cash backup will be able to buy more on the cheap.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:50:34
It only went down a little, now it's riding it's way right back up to 200... wow, bitcion is very resistant to crashing right now i guess.
[edit] and within 10 minutes it's back to 197 each...
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:21:08
a bit

Come at me!
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:09:09
I think they'll stay hands off for as long as they can.  They know that this will provide the rest of the world with a fall-back after they trash the dollar, on top of that, china already owns most of them, so they'll make a killing.
I think china is aiming their laser pointer right at that big eye on top of the pyramid, they'll stay hands off.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:38:35
Yeah, but it'll be twice that for a bit because there'll only be 14 million coins by then.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:21:19
I wouldn't be so close to say that.  The collapse of fiat due to bitcoins is many years away.  The collapse of fiat may not be as far away due to the recklessness of the united states federal reserve bank.
