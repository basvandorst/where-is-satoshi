I messaged Shift a few weeks ago and they confirmed that there will be a EMV chip coming soon.

McAfee is a crazy man. Who's taking him seriously?

You missed it. The end is at 21 minutes.

I've been using this app for over a year. Very useful. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:36:41
I'm not sure if I understand this.. 
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:57:38
This is what I want to know. 
Edit:Also, Shift says you can also use  Dwolla in which I know nothing about.

But how do I send bitcoin back too my circle account? I wasn't aware this could be done to buy more btc. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:11:44
To add. They'll ban your account if you withdraw without tipping.

Btc atms in Georgia? Damn, I need a map. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:34:04
What'd you buy? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:16:46
Thanks, I just figured it out. I've never actually sent money using a QR code before as Circle requests. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 15:00:17
Where did you find these op? Still pretty cool to find bitcoin products in a brick and mortar store. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:26:28
That wouldn't work on me for I'd try and eat that suspicious Pita bread.
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:45:10
I don't think they accept cards just bank transfers which takes a few days I've heard. Circle takes Visa and Mastercard,  no one takes Discover and AmEx. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:22:11
That's what I did. They banned both accounts. You should be able to get away with it the first time. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 01:03:27
I don't see how this is still a problem. Backing up my wallet was the first thing I did after creating my first wallet. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:54:31
They're auctioning the same day as they did the raids?
@_date: 2015-11-23 15:55:08
Thank you I did not know this.

I read that article too!
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:54:43
Did you just buy OP's soul?
@_date: 2015-10-09 14:41:45
Same for me.  The update isn't on playstore yet. It's been 12+ hours. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:47:47
Wait are you joking? I am still new to bitcoin news (so much still to learn!)  I was not aware you can steal blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:21:34
What do you suggest instead?

1 BTC is $330 am I missing something here?

Datt is more creator based more like a Patreon service it seems. The links on reddit vary from news, websites, creator content, videos. Datt is more of creator content support.

There's an app called BTC Price in the app store. It has an alarm like you're describing in settings. [Link to Playstore] (

Reallly? I was supposed to get a notification for when Bitstamp hits 300. :/

Microsoft wants these images deleted from the internet. He is furious. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:07:51
I'm on android and have yet to see the play store update. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 04:18:02
I fell for it too.
