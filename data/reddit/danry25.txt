It takes 12 seconds to load the site initially in Firefox here and 4 to 5 seconds to load pages as I browse the site.  Chromium took 10 seconds to load the site initially, and 4 seconds on average as I browsed around the site. My latency to the server the site is on is 184.232ms average, and 0% packet loss over the course of 100 pings, so connectivity is not the issue.
Thus, the backend has issues handling the load either on BitcoinStarter, or on the server its on.


[We've gotten lots of traffic]( and it looks like the projects on BitcoinStarter are the ones that are withering. Lots of people do use Godaddy for domain name registration, but it is the mark of an amateur to buy their domains, and especially their SSL certs through them, when you look at their history of supporting SOPA &amp; similar legislation.
This essentially means that Godaddy could revoke the SSL cert and domain for being linked to bitcoins/money laundering, hence why you should really use a reputable non-US based domain registrar.


Nope, still crappy as all get out, I mean shit, even a default Catarse install is faster &amp; looks a hell of a lot better than BitcoinStarter's current site, and it has at least a magnitude of order (if not more) more people maintaining it.

BitcoinStarter seems pretty crappy, page load times in Chromium and Firefox are at least 7 seconds, if not more, and it seems your domain is registered with GoDaddy and using a janky ass SSL cert from them too.
Overall, you might as well roll your own with [selfstarter.us]( or [quickstarter]( like [we over at the Seattle Meshnet Project did](
TL;DR: BitcoinStarter seems crappy &amp; risky

I'm going on about the fact that you appear to be an alt for and the fact that your page is slow as shit. People do care if a site doesn't load in a split second, if a site takes 4 or 5 seconds to load, you'll loose 60% of your potential visitors. Add the fact that bitcoiners tend to be much more security conscious, and they'll see that ssl cert and gtfo.
You should really fix what appears to be your site, as it could be a nice addition to the bitcoin community, but currently its a hot steamy mess, hence why it has nearly no backers.

Well, you'd generally notice most hardware backdoors that a manufacturer could add, for example the backdoor in the AT&amp;T Microcells is a great example of this. 
Software wise we are using an open source software stack, usually with the exception of some non-free radio firmware, although iirc on the current hardware platform we've chosen, even the drivers and radio firmware are free, although I may be wrong about the firmware OpenWRT uses for Atheros AR9xxx series chips, and it may be closed source.

In a few months it'll be much cheaper, 70% of the $125 is paying for open source software development, and I'm sure someone will be offering $30 meshboxes once we start offering ready made OpenWRT images.

Well, its been hovering right around 1 BTC, right now it looks to be 0.9697 BTC = $125 USD, and that'd be how much we'd ask you for in BTC, although a shade more is always welcome :P

It is a bit steep, but 71% of that is going towards FOSS software development, and I'm sure once the code is done, Roaming Initiative will offer a $30 meshbox.

Hit me up if you need some peers, instructions &amp; the instructions on the github shoul work on Debain servers, at least they seem to work fine on mine :P

Also, its easy to just set up a google apps account &amp; get proper  addresses. Then you won't look like some janky fly by night operation.

You could also just run cjdns on your computer, preformance will be much better too. Partner this with a fully FLOSS computer and its highly unlikely there are any backdoors.

Ah, but what would the return be to pay off said bond? All the code we develop is GPLv3 licensed, and all the media assets we develop are CC-BY licensed. 
My current plan is to get a good OpenWRT package together and start turning out MeshBoxes, turn in this grant application we've been writing soon &amp; get that end going, and file for proper 501c3 status with the IRS.

Yeah, has a relay bot running now between  on EFnet and Freenode, and on a couple other channels too.

Open garden doesn't live up to its name, it isn't compatible with Linux, its closed source, and it generally preforms worse than a plain jane ad-hoc wifi network. 
There are some other things about it that are bad, but it was being spammed to quite a bit a few months back, I'm sure those threads highlight some the other negatives about it too.

It wouldn't affect your internet speed :)

Hey, you've seriously blown the 10 to 1 rule out of the water, and your account has been reported to @_date: 2013-06-03 22:26:42
No trouble, and thanks for your support!

Sure, I'll bring it up, I'm sure we could pull together some more work to do. Ideally we'll be able to ship these routers out early, at this point its just the webgui that we are putting together.
