Thanks for this information.  What if my claim is 10 BTC, and $10,000 fiat.  Does the $10,000 get added to your estimate above?

I see the SEC's point after reading the decision.  The SEC was created to protect ordinary investors.   And with bitcoin they are essentially powerless to uphold laws around market manipulation and punish offenders.  Decisions like this are tough, but important for the integrity of the financial system.

I think the most analogous situation is what happens when a stock is spun off, as opposed to a split.  So you own stock A, and you receive a special dividend consisting of Stock B.  I believe, but I'm not certain, that when you sell stock B the basis is generally considered to be zero. But the important thing is of course the fact that you only have to recognize the tax when you sell the asset.

What are the chances that governments respond by making it outright illegal for anyone to purchase cryptocurrencies?  It may be draconian, but making it nearly impossible for hackers to get paid is a logical step they could take.

Interesting question.  I imagine there would be a big divergence of opinions on that. In the US it is illegal to pay a hostage/kidnapping ransom.  The result is that some people (like James Foley) have been killed, but the US argument is that this hard-line policy serves the greater good because it discourages future hostage-taking.  But many people think this is a callous policy and disagree strongly.
As it relates to cryptocurrencies, if devastating high-profile attacks like this continue, I think you will hear more people saying that their harm (facilitating criminal conduct) far outweighs their benefit to society, and should thus be banned.  Even talk about that subject would not be good for our bitcoins.
