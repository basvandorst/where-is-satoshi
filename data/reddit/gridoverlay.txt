Hey something similar happened to me:   
  
I attempted to buy some Ethereum, and accidentally set Coinbase to withdraw from a bank account that I had closed.
Coinbase transferred the Ethereum I tried to purchase back to coinbase (in my transactions, I see the ETH I bought was “sent to coinbase”). Great, this works for all parties, no problems here.
However, a few days before the ETH was transferred back to Coinbase, I have a BTC transaction “sent to coinbase”. I did not send this transaction myself. It appears that Coinbase took my BTC to cover the ETH transaction that didn’t go through.
So at this point, the ETH transaction was reversed, but Coinbase still has my BTC.  
  Did you ever have any luck getting it back?

I just spoke with coinbase support on the phone - they claim that my account was probably hacked (no proof of that), and that someone named them self "Coinbase" and sent the bitcoin to "Coinbase".  
  
I don't really buy that.

Something very similar is happening with me - Did you ever get resolution?  
  
My bank reversed a transaction and Coinbase sent my entire BTC wallet to coinbase (luckily not a ton in there, but still!).  I finished the transaction and they never returned the BTC to me.
