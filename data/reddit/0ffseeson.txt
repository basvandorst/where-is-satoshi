yes, i know about the instant ACH. it's a good way to hook people in. till the fees become apparent.  
that makes sense about coinbase vs gdax. For those who can get verified on GDAX, and don't need deposits to clear instantly, it's a way better platform for trading - not just for the fees. the tools are better too.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:55:46
how are you getting lower fees? GDAX has no fee for maker. There don't seem to be any no-fee trades on gemini. Unless you're a high volume trader . 
edit: i'm equating GDAX with coinbase. why would anyone actually trade on coinbase.com. i cant figure out what its even good for.

I hadn't heard of this, just read about it. I'm missing the point- Say you have £200 worth of btc (.0591 btc right now). You put your btc in a hedge fund tied to GBP. If btc goes up, you might then only have .04 BTC, or if it goes down, you might have .06. In any case, you always have the equivalent of £200 in btc.  
How is that any different from simply selling the btc? You've stopped tracking its value. The only difference I see is that in the end, your funds are in BTC, not GBP, so is it all to save trading fees? Not to mention there's a fee to set up the hedge anyway?  
I've never used hedge funds, so maybe I'm missing a fundamental. Someone can enlighten me.

I once sent some to the wrong address by mistake. I couldn't find who I sent it to. I had been careless, and mistakenly used an address I had previously sent btc to, instead of pasting in a new one.  
which is to say, it may be from someone who has sent you btc before.

I have the same question. I've been selling small amounts on localbitcoin, but the rates on paxful are insanely high. Whats the catch?
@_date: 2017-01-21 00:11:50
Look in the "Limits" column. Make sure $400 is within the advertiser's range.  
click on the BUY button. That leads you to the Buy page. Under "How much do you want to buy?" enter 400 in the USD box. Leave the BTC box empty. You can choose to buy a quantity of btc or usd.
@_date: 2017-08-26 06:11:46
Just curious, how much were you trying to buy during the dip?
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:28:39
gemini credits your bank deposits instantly, so you can buy right away. although you can't withdraw the bitcoin untill the transfer completes, several days later.  
or buy in cash, in person from someone on localbitcoins.  It costs more .... but maybe not. Say LBC seller marks up X% over the exchange. Compare paying market+X% today    VS   market in a few days.  
If you're missing out on a X% run-up waiting for your deposit to clear, it's the same as paying X% trading fee. In the end, you pay Market + X.

sorry that happened to you. that sucks. I buy/sell on localbitcoins &amp; fully verify my identity, even do in-person cash transactions in my area. PM me if you need to move some btc again.

"When moving funds between your different currency accounts within your CoinJar, there may be a small fee for the conversion"
So aside from trading fees, it's the same as selling your bitcoin and buying it back later. I'd skip the hedge fund and sell the btc. Then you at least have the choice of whether or not to buy it back later.
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:44:05
it's only "selling for" $400 *because* you're not allowed to sell it. ($400 doesn't represent a true market demand)
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:06:55
I was just looking at the price chart for 2017. Back a few months, it seemed like a big deal whether i bought at 1200 or 1300. now, I'd take either deal in a heartbeat.  
If you think btc is going far above where it is now, then you'll be looking back and chuckling about your trivial concerns whether to buy at 4k vs 5k.  
If you don't think btc is going far, then why buy?

withdrawals out of any exchange can take several hours, or part of a day. It's not like sending from your own wallet - the transaction isn't immediately broadcast, it goes into an outgoing cue. So you won't see any activity on the receiving address.

it's listed as a trading pair, along with the other trading pairs, when you hover on the current symbol at the upper left of the window

Does P2P usually include a surcharge over exchange rates? If not, what are some P2P sources for "market rate"?
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:14:39
what's the deal with paxful? the rates to sell are insanely high. is it all scams?

Bitfinex is now trading BCH, but not accepting deposits.
I dumped mine for USD. Did I really just get free money?

(presuming you mean 10k btc. Here in US, we write "10,000".)
10k btc isn't just a few million USD, it's 70 Million. That could move a market.

[This Thread on bitcointalk](  
They add up btc sent to unrecoverable addresses, or known cases of lost/ destroyed keys.  
The guy who blew 9k bitcoins is sad sad sad.  
And then there's Bitomat, the exchange that lost their hotwallet because it was stored on a virtual machine in the cloud. 17000 Bitcoin.

selling a mere few million usd worth of bitcoin won't move the markets. maybe on a smaller exchange, but the bots will instantly arbitrage that away.
The order books are highly contrived, gamed, and adapt quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:00:39
well said. To expand further, for newbies - What IS in your wallet is a cryptographic key, or set of keys that unlocks 1 or more addresses on the blockchain. There can be any number of copies of those keys. Anyone with that key has access to those bitcoin addresses. That's why your key has to be in your control. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:26:27
ok. see edit. So you'd have 2 wallets seeing the same btc. btc aren't "transferred" to the new one, there's no transaction.   
It hadn't occurred to me that there can be multiple instances of a single wallet - is this capability ever used in practice?
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:22:50
see edit: what happens to the bitcoins - where do they end up?
@_date: 2017-04-15 19:43:19
damn. I knew that but forgot :) . 
It's fascinating how mobile the bitcoins are. Not only can they be transported quickly anywhere, they ***already are*** everywhere. If I want to pay someone btc, I don't even need a transaction. I can have the btc in a (BIP39) wallet, memorize 12 words and simply speak it to them.    
Imagining a spy thriller, where one person could be a walking bank vault, worth billions. There are no wallets or keys, and the value of those btc exists *only* in the 12 memorized words in their mind. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 06:58:03
You're saying that when a transaction first happens, the unconfirmed transaction can reach any wallet in the world, via the peer network in a few seconds?
Does the destination address encode any information about how to "find" it? If not, wouldnt the unconfirmed transaction need to reach *every* wallet in the world?
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:00:30
thank you. That's amazing. I understood how a fresh block propagates through the whole network every 10 minutes, but I never pictured how every wallet is instantly accessible to every other one.  
A couple follow-on Q's -   
So that mean each node must knows which wallets are connected to it. For each transaction, if the node sees that its for one of its connected wallets, it sends it to that wallet?
I run bitcoin core on my own desktop. You're saying that it's seeing every global btc transaction within seconds of it happening?  
Is there a good "medium-level" tech explanation of this connection protocol somewhere? (somewhere between layman's terms &amp; full tech spec)
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:27:59
I do wires too. And I do like the quicker availability than ACH. 
It comes down to convenience &amp; cost - unfortunately with my bank, a wire requires a visit in person and costs $30.

Fantastic info, just what I was looking for. 
Curious to know more about your crypto lending - feel free to PM if you prefer not to say publicly. 
And they're fine with that? do you have any particular licensing as a financial business? Do they show any concern about you reselling ?
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:13:11
Pay attention, bitcoin world. This is how it's done.  
(thank you)

Yes, I've actually tried that fire drill - as any prudent user should. It's no small task for a layman (Bread's target markets). I'd love to see Bread publish a step by step recovery process - starting with just a 12 word phrase, and no Bread app.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:42:44
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:54:14
except not restricting the withdrawal of btc till the ACH clears, as Gemini does.   
instant deposit AND instant availability of BTC. game changer.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:59:20
let me strongly encourage "high portability". There's no guarantee your app will be around forever (open source notwithstanding). To completely trust the wallet, a wise customer would not depend on a single vendor.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:03:03
is it still open source?
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:46:57
no. its just the hospital hackers cashing out...
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:50:08
I recite my recovery phrase daily. it exists only in my memory. in theory I should feel no worry if my phone falls down a sewer. In reality - I've been meaning to conduct a "fire drill" and actually test my recovery process &amp; see if I can recreate access to my wallet
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:15:31
