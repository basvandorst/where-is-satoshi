I think you need to eat your hat there buddy. Seems like it crashed exactly when I said it would +- a few minutes. Crashed 3k$ for 5 hours since then.

WTCH THE VIDEO. 2X SPEED IF YOU MUST. Sorry for the caps. Ive been researching BTC full time since summer. This is serious. Ive written lengthy dissertations on patterns that form from side effects in nature. And this is it. All alarms go off right now.

Nobody can time the market you say? I did in a major way +- 10min yesterday: 
Sure its 1 prediction that nailed it. Subscribe to my posts and I'll let you know about the next one.

Charts. Do you want me to dig up the same exact S-curve onramp from 2011 and 2010? Charts don't predict shit. Patterns do. Watch the video. Its how viruses grow. Social networks. Population growth etc. Thanks for your Inout tho. I do not mean to offend. Just want to understand.

Thanks for your input. "That Indian movie" ^^ You mean bajirao mastani

Perfect timing one might say? To carry us through the crypto ice-age in 2018. Will it feature crypto like attributes? Will there be new meme opportunities? Will Satoshi make a cameo? Will it binge?

If you can focus 24/7 on something for 6 months. You don't need more time than that to be an expert in any field. Unless you got a day-job, then your rekt. lulz

We will see won't we? I created this post exactly when it tipped. I'll be right or wrong. It's the exact same pattern as has happened in all the previous crashes. there are 5 of them. Calling any one of these crashes counts for something IMO. Show me a post you made that was on the dot? Timing must be exact. No vague buffers plz. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:04:22
thats illogical. 1000x correct calls..... thats proof of time travel IMO.

Zoom out. Humanity is on ramping a new exponential technology. there is nothing external about it. What do you think about this graph:   I guess from this perspective it reaches some plateau very soon and then ice age until 2020 or so.

Calling this now tho, after the slide happened 11 hours ago is not really impressive. I called this 10min prior to the event.     Best regards, BallzOfSteel

Name one narrow field that can't be thought in 6months? Sure if your slow then it may take longer. Also Attacking the person not the content is just evidence of argumentation fatigue. IMO

Id link to my github awards ranking but ya know. Anonymity and all. Neurosurgeon is more like a jack of many trades, you have to have many degrees before you can narrow down on the final trade. IMO. Expert hockey player is also someone playing way down in league 6. relatively speaking. Or expert relative to your age group. My point is that you can excel in any field relative to your competition if you focus 100% in 6 months. IMO. The crypto field is so young and it really only happened the last 6 months. Crypto Kittens for instance. It's just 9days old. There are already experts in this field relative to the rest.

Ive made fortunes recognising patterns. relatively speaking. And whats with the personal attack? It's reddit and all but attack the analysis not the person. Please
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:06
follow my posts and I'll give you a hint when the next event happens. It will stop you from losing millions. I'm not an oracle. Im just perceptive. And I have time for this shit. NO sleep for the wicked. Peace

So you think it's A? i'm 99% sure its A. But I still cant listen to my self. Its fucked up. Im just human i guess. The other stuff you write I  can sort of understand. When BTC hits 3-5m$ Then there are no more fiat. World recognises btc as the reserve currency. And thats that. We all pay with crypto. Universal Basic Income is implemented for the non holders. Or did I missunderstand you?

TBH: Kinda relieved that it's all over now. Can go back to doing something productive again. Sorry for the FUD. But it's pretty evident. Meanwhile ya'll busy with memes and diluting what the conversation should really be about. And yes Im just like you, I don't have ballz of steel. I'm hoping some of you can make an argument that is powerful enough though. That 200m withdraw from gdax today was a steal. They understood what was about to happen. Patterns. Patterns. Patterns. Nature. Humanity. Rinse repeat.
