Expat living in Canada, i'm livid about it. America's over reach is beyond ridiculous. The tax reporting requirements are near impossible to comply with. I can't even maintain a tax deferred retirement account in Canada because america doesn't recognize the tax benefits. Thanks FATCA!
Many expats are renouncing, infact the onerous regulations have driven a surge in expatriation. Murica conveniently just upped the expat fee to 2000 dollars, plus a hefty exit tax. I'll be renouncing my usa citizen ship in a few years.

explain, once your prior tax obligations are confirmed to be filed and paid you no longer have to file us tax returns etc. At least thats what I understood. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:18:15
oh harharharhar your so original
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:55:41
you have to pay a huge amount. 
The fee itself is 2k and then you have an exit tax on UNREALIZED capital gains. Its insane 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:00:14
Yea sorry I don't owe America a thing. Your statement is akin to saying you owe your parents money for raising you. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:21:22
Look last month they increased just the FEE to renounce by 400% Do you think I want to renounce? No way, but for my basic survival its starting to look like a necessity. just look at this insane shit we have to deal with:
'There are 2 different types of penalties for not filing an FBAR by the due date – Non-Willful and Willful.
Maximum Penalty Non-willful:
$10,000. No penalty shall be imposed if the violation was due to reasonable cause and the amount of the transaction or the balance in the account at the time of the transaction was properly reported
Maximum Willful violations:
The greater of $100,000 or 50% of the balance of the account at the time of the violation
Penalty Mitigation-

You clearly don't get it. 
when I lived in America I paid taxes.
Now that live in a foreign country I contribute to the roads/services here and pay taxes. Yet america still stakes a claim to my income even though I do not use any american services/infrastructure. Are my investment incomes supposed to be double taxed? Are expats supposed to pay income tax at home and to america? Is my income supposed to be taxed at over 50% simply because I live abroad? 
Furthermore, I am subject to ridiculous filing requirements that violate my privacy and autonomy that regular USA citizens are not. Its gotten so bad foreign banks do not even want to do business with Americans. 
You should try moving abroad before you come out with your purely ignorant opinions.

Why do this by hand? Get an old TI83 calculator and program the algorithim into it. 
PS just noticed you mentioned graphing calculator. I'd take that route, or an old iphone maybe. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:33:52
you have to pay very large sums of money, retarded indeed

just gonna say that there are other devices everybit as capable. 'Better' is just purely opinion 
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:59:10
Yea they really do. They are also the only advanced economy to try and lay claim to tax expat income. Lots of us expats are considering renouncing. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:36:08
No, I don't have to 'understand'. What america is doing is clear over reach and abuse of power and I will continue to call it like that. 
In fact we should be very loud and vocal about this. America is the only 'first world' nation that taxes its citizens like this. 
A country where your supposedly 'free' shouldn't be trying to influence their citizens to stay with abusive tax codes. If it were so great I would not have left to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 14:42:36
it sounds like the code mined some bitcoins that 'went missing' on the tidbit servers from what I can tell 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:37:49
oh ok lol. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:19:34


That is actually a pretty grand assumption........
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:33:00
Hey this is pretty neat! I'm gonna give it a try
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:32:53
The fact that their holdings are insured is huge. This should give investors some confidence. This could mark a turning point for bitcoin to the mainstream. I'm excited! 
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:42:59
This is huge 
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:41:55
I hope you don't have all your money in BTC. If you do... you should now work on diversifying your savings.. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:20:28
to be fair here, I'm certain the NYSE has a very impressive uptime percentage as well.

I love this image:
It is so true! And is exactly what is happening with bitcoin now. The irony is beautiful 
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:51:30
Here comes the next bitcoin surge 
@_date: 2015-03-16 22:37:40
Yea I was thinking about that... They should at least owe me some money for the opportunity cost of not having access for 2 months. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:57:11
I think you missed the idea here.. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:45:16
I think you missed the point 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:52:19
thanks for reading 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:55:32
Yep, just figured i'd share. Its amazing its 2015 and it took 2 months for me to receive my money when my brokerage closed my account. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:56:02
Haha right. Still waiting till I can buy financial assets with bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:51:55
