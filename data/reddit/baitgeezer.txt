Of course I do!
I saw '£' and assumed ~~you're~~ UK based
Regardless, I don't actually care. ~~Don't see why you felt the need to tell us all that you spent your coin(s) on weed unless you're trying to be cool~~
edit: thought you were OP

I used to be petrified of roller-coasters 
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:07:04
Wait, did you just admit to using your BTC to....**break the law!?!?!** 
I cannot believe it!
I won't believe it!

I was going to say, 0.001 should be more than big enough but forgot to mention it in my reply

Just got back from the future. Pretty cool to be the only person with a time machine, the ladies **love it**.
So, in the year 2099; humans have evolved to have tails and 3 ears, cars can fly and BTC is a globally used curreny now worth....
You do the math

You can [check this link]( here you will be able see the fastest and cheapest transaction fee.
You can also use a **replaceable fee**, this means that you can modify the fee at a later date if the transaction is taking forever..
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:04:18
Oh, if it's a fixed fee I wouldn't worry. 0.001btc seems like a good enough fee and it shouldn't take all that long to transfer

You can always buy a bigger garage... With the price increase! And then you buy more Lambos :-]

I know a few who have sold out and are now regretting it, my pull out game is weak
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:20:29
Not sure how practical this would actually be
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:14:29
I got given my BTC so technically I am down 0 but I'd love to see them bounce back ;)
