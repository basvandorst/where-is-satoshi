Love the site and shirts. Tried to buy one but was required to register an account so I dropped off.
Please allow guest checkout soon.

Learn from this. Don't let somebody else you've never met manage your money.

...bitcoin users unaffected.

True, but I think OP is on to something with the charities.
A commercial asking for donations that I can pay with by holding up my phone, sending the money, and being done is much more effective than a commercial that asks me to do one of two things: Pick up the phone and call them, or go to a computer and use their website...type in your billing addr, cc number, etc...no thanks. I'm just waiting for my show to come back on!!

Somewhat unrelated, but I just integrated Bitpay into a Magento store, and it was a breeze.

This change is for Bitcoin-Qt, the bitcoin client.
I do not believe the bitcoin protocol is being changed.

I thought it was assumed that Satoshi wasn't a single person, based on the fact that the original codebase was inconsistent in coding style.

This post *should* have been about gambling addiction.
Instead, you're claiming that all gambling is wrong.


I just won 0.2 BTC last night betting a 50/50 on SatoshiMines. Explain how I ultimately lost?

Creating an account is both a waste of time, and a commitment.
Regardless, I don't have to rationalize my behavior. All the proof OP needs is to allow guest checkout and he'll see the benefits reflect in his conversion rate.

This will only affect those who are trying to exchange their dollars for bitcoins.
Those who use bitcoins as a real currency will be unaffected. The US government can't touch your bitcoins.
