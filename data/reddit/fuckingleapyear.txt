Because they obviously don't know what a  blockchain is. maybe if they sat down for a few hours, read through the whitepaper they would be better off making opinions on the currency.

Half a billion to the government IS pennies.
I think the question is, would manufacturers be able to keep up?
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:28:23
Hmm, that's interesting. Thanks for the info, I was not aware of previous fork.
Also, a 51% share attack was discussed briefly during the hearings in NY.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:36:17
well that escalated quickly.

HTTPS means **NOTHING** if there was a trojan/ keylogger/malware on your computer that allowed an attacker to do this.
**You're at fault here**, not GOX, not bitcoin, **YOU**. Take a note and **enable 2FA** if you decide to get back in.
Also: your computer is probably compromised. Disable any kind of Browser JAVA/APPLETS (Not javascript), This stuff is as bad as ActiveX exploits were in early 2000s.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:47:34
this is true. We need a newer generation in power of decision making. until then, these concepts will just go over the tops of heads.

**WHY ANYONE WOULD TRUST A MAGIC THE GATHERING EXCHANGE FOR THEIR BITCOINS IS BEYOND ME.**
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:54:38
That girls voice is fucking irritating.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:05:22
Yes, if you hack me, it's my fault. 
I'm saying HTTPS isn't even very secure anymore (but that's not even my point, my point was that if you had a trojan or keylogger it doesn't matter if secure HTTP is used). 2FA doesn't have to be required by anyone. This is something that you may look at about a business before doing business with them. If you do your research and see what options they have for allowing you to secure your funds, you would be able to make better choices. it's the Wild West out here right now, so if you want to be a part of it, you're going to:
 A) Have to do your research,
 B) understand the environment,
 C) Acknowledge that there exists a risk.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:30:00
Only, IF ONLY, they had just read the whitepaper before coming into the hearing.. You would think you may want to research a topic before being asked to provide your opinion of it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:23:30


@_date: 2014-01-31 02:09:41
Because they go above and beyond to meet lawful requirements.

Damn I wouldn't mind having this guy, Mr. Felten in politics...

You don't need one, the transaction should display in your wallet, or you can use the blockchain
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:31:01
They do, I just think less people engage in those activities because of legal fear. (Not that a lot don't) but when banks decide to close accounts associated with bitcoin it will still hurt because bitcoin will not have gained enough traction. It will become harder for people to obtain mortgages, and do other things we still rely on banks for.
@_date: 2014-01-14 07:38:11
I think you mean anti-virus software. 
There's a few decent free ones, I think trend micro, AVG, read reviews.

We've already forked once already, it wouldn't be a huge deal to the outside (people spending, not mining)
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:44:26
Right, that's inherited, not traded though.
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:36:05
I was just saying, I couldn't pay for *my* tuition, not that it wasn't possible to pay any tuition. I guess I should have been more specific.
To further the question though, lets say High school tuition.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:12:52
Well, so they have more than 51% attack, everyone loses faith, bitcoin goes to 0. Or Blockchain fork, and all government public keys are blacklisted and miners agree to not confirm any of their transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-15 02:05:41
Lol stop trying to make me feel bad about my loss. 
The truth is I have many many more BTC, enough that losing 3BTC is not a big deal to me.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:30:10
Lol good luck.
@_date: 2014-02-01 04:54:57
Is there a super high res of this image somewhere? I'd like to print it out on some nice stock and frame it.
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:10:43
No I lost $100, not 3K. The $2,900 would have been gains. 
It's an investment. 
Me saying shit happens, is not bitter.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:10:21
Because you think the average person on the road is going to tip you?
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:26:44
Really? I thought programming was stressed now more than ever in schools. I went to a private school and did not have a formal computer class, I did however have formal Art, and Digital Art classes. I had learned programming on my own time.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:58:35
Correct, you can't shut it down, but governments can ban it, and make sure no businesses in that country take it.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:25:23
Maybe OP means next year :/

Wrong dude, dude. (that's williams)
FELTEN IS THE MAN BTW.
WOOO FELTEN!
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:20:14
While that maybe true, I feel it is especially true of technical people. 
A lot (obviously there's always exceptions to every rule) but the majority of highly technical people have difficulty explaining things to less technical people in a way that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:23:49
This is called Arbitrage, and the reason is TIME. Most exchanges (read all) have some time to withdraw fiat(USD). By waiting a minimum of 2 days between taking your money out and buying somewhere else the price may have changed. In some cases it may make sense just to rebuy at that same exchange (BTC price drop). So it's not really useful to trade between BTC/Fiat. Since cryptos can been withdrawn to a wallet nearly instantly, it's much quicker/easier to trade between two cryptos such as BTC/LTC. The thing is not every exchange supports alternative cryptos. And the ones that do have very close rates, mostly because of this arbitrage. Eventually the prices catch up when people preform arbitrage across exchanges.
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:54:51
your parents are a rarity, I just met a fellow DEVELOPER who didn't know what bitcoin was. 
is right, there are a LOT more people out of the loop than you'd think.

You are aware there are companies who do offer BTC insurance, right?
It's not cheap, but it does offer peace of mind for those who need it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 23:18:44
Even finding the right example seems to be a drag.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:26:12
Total Ass-Hat.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:10:53
The thing that's really bothering me about these panels is that it comes down to this issue: 
The people who are not involved in the tech world (read: not techy/or technical people) do not know enough to be calling the shots, or even hold a valid opinion.
The people who are involved in the tech world, or at least have some exposure to it, know enough but cannot speak in a way that will get their knowledge and understanding heard.
@_date: 2014-01-14 00:24:03
Good, be bitter.
By the way, it usually is something they downloaded, or a site they visited. It is their fault for not having virus protection, security is on you, in less you're paying someone else to do it for you.
I've lost 3BTC about 2 years ago on GOX because they got DDOS'D and then HACKED afterwards. They sent an email out to everyone, and they never recovered my funds. It was $100 lost. It sucked, but it was the risk I was willing to take. This wasn't even my fault, because my computer wasn't compromised. But I still didn't become bitter, why? Because it was part of the risk at the time.

College tuition.

Well you have a wonderful wife. Unfortunately my wife wouldn't be able to afford me a loan. I was also brought up to save. I never use my credit card without cash funds to back up my purchase. Getting a home however, is a bit harder.

While this tag seems pretty cool, albeit probably expensive. I don't see the need for this. When shopping in a store the price should be listed in the currency used in that geography. 
Only at the end when you are being rung out, should your totals be converted to BTC.
The only exception would be in a case where the currency of the country/state/province/etc. itself is extremely volatile.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:55:48
fiat to crypto or crypto to fiat obviously can't work very well mostly because of the abilities to do charge backs with fiat payment providers. I'm talking non-fiat exchanges.

Why is everyone so unhappy, he just gave the biggest endorsement to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:31:58
Wouldn't happen. There are already decentralized exchanges. They can't be shutdown. Eventually trading will be built into your wallet (maybe there are coins which do this already).
