The thing is, their cost basis is mostly below $100 per coin. Even if Bitcoin crashes by 80% from current level, they will still be in fat profit.

Not really, the same could not happen with Bitcoin. But you only begin to understand it if you've done an extensive cross-disciplinary research - which most shitcoin "believers" are obviously incapable of.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about: "My favorite shitcoin is not a shitcoin because &lt;reasons&gt;!"
No, it's not different because &lt;reasons&gt;. Read "Bitcoin standard" book to understand why.

I'd argue &lt;my favorite shitcon&gt; must be somehow different!

Sigh. It's impossible to teach the person who prefers to keep his ignorance. Like I said, by all means, enjoy your shitcoins while they last.

The time is fast approaching when millions of bagholders of now worthless altcoins will start lynching all the prominent altcoin shills they can put their hands on. And for a good reason too.

Suuure - it is ME who is pretending that opponent is a Nazi fanatic. Talk about a broken logic.


The feeling is mutual, so why don't you try to find a more receptive audience for your slimy shitcoin propaganda? I have neither desire to convert you nor interest in reading your incoherent (if colorful) ramblings.

By all means. Someone should be left holding the bag when all the shitcoins demonetize completely. Why not you.

It's important to consider context. "Buy the dip" only works in a bull market. In the bear market, "Sell the pop" is the way to go. Tread carefully and you won't regret it.

Sure, keep loading up on them shitcoins and "hodling" them. Someone should be left holding the bag when all this shit demonetizes completely. Why not you.

No you don't. Bitfinex has a special system for market makers, they can put non-backed orders of pretty much any size on order book.

Even though he makes a lot of effort, Roger Ver still comes through as an absolutely clueless asshole parroting the same stale talking points. This is a non-debate. Pathetic.

Why is this so ridiculously hyped? This is old old news, July 2017. Nothing to see here.
