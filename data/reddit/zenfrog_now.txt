You won't have to wait that long. Because of exponential halvings, 99% of all Bitcoin will be mined by 2036. That should be close enough to evoke quite a bit of stabilization of value and volatility.

I think Bitcoins price volatility is driven by supply and demand. The rate of demand is exceeding the rate of supply.

The last Bitcoin will be mined approximately 2140. You and I will be dead. My assumption is that by then technology will advance so far beyond our current comprehension that a solution will be found.

The last Bitcoin will be mined somewhere around 2140. You and I will be dead. It's way too early to worry about it, but my guess is that technology will have advanced far beyond our comprehension and an agreeable solution will be determined.

It's not about owning an entire Bitcoin. It's about transaction with currency that hasn't been manipulated and diluted by central banks. The misconception people seem to have is that you have to own, buy or spend Bitcoin in their entirety. You can buy a pack of gum with Bitcoin. A pack of gum will cost about .0005 Bitcoin.

Hahaha... tulips again and hacking lol. They may be financial experts in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, and banking, maybe (huge maybe), but they don't have a clue about how the block chain works. Complete rubbish but that's ok, it keeps the price down for those of us who do get it :)

If don't know anything about Crypto's, here's a good place to start.
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:48:38
Bitcoin and other crypto currencies do solve a problem. The problem they solve is that they can't be manipulated by central banks. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:05:26
Here we go again trying to manipulate currency. The great thing about Bitcoin and other crypto currencies is that they can't be manipulated, especially by a governments or central banks. Bitcoin is going to take it's own course based on supply and demand. It'll probably take a financial crisis of some kind before most people recognize the value of cryptos. Until then, as in most things, the early adopters will reap the greatest benefit. At the moment there are over 3000 businesses that accept crypto currency as payment. There are people on Craigslist and eBay selling and buying with crypto. It's starting to catch on. The US is almost 20 trillion dollars in debt. They can't even pay the interest on an astronomical number like that, yet the US dollar is the central currency most of the world uses for international trade. Looks like a bit of a time bomb? Cryptos to the rescue!

This is a great video that quickly explains a lot about cryptos.

Wake up people, negative interest rates are already happening on the form of fees!

Brilliant idea. I hope this catches on. It’s time to take back control of our finances. Enough is enough.

Seriously Chicken Little, the sky is not falling.

Bitcoin has nothing to do with gold. Bitcoin is being used as currency. Over 3,000 businesses are accepting Bitcoin as  currency for payment.

OMG... using the president as an example for anything. Hahahahaha...
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:28:32
Crypto currencies are unlike anything that has ever occurred in history. You can't compare it to something that has already occurred... it hasn't.

Laughed out loud. Awesome answer... I'm keeping that one 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:35:41
That's not necessarily true. Because of the fees Bitcoin can be used to make larger purchases and store larger sums of money, while some other alt coin with lower fees and faster transaction times can be used for day to day smaller expenses. Bitcoin could be used like gold, to store wealth and hedge against inflation.

As soon as Amazon accepts Bitcoin... game over.

Excuse my ignorance, but I am familiar with 3 of the 4 terms used on this map. What is the def of “Alegal”?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:05:12
Even if hypothetically something did happen to him for his inappropriate behavior, like maybe he gets fined, in the banking industry it goes on the books as the cost of doing business. The fine will always be less than the profit that he has reaped.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:01:19
Wait, they‘re caught stealing, they’re fined $1.2B, and no one goes to jail?! It’s called the cost of doing business I guess. Disgusting.

Most of us can read the writing on the wall, we just assume it’s addressed to someone else.

$130M in short liquidation’s at BitMex. They obviously see the writing on the wall and want to cut their losses.
