The minimum fee is still way too high for the “vision” of Bitcoin, and no I’m not talking about it being a “store of value”. What you’re basicially saying is there are such a huge amount of people moving many thousands and willing to pay a high fee while everyone else can’t transfer at all or has to wait days. Cool currency in its infancy (personally I wouldn’t call 10 years infancy stages but okay).
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:18:03
Do you want Bitcoin to be used properly? I don’t understand why you even question it when the problems are so obvious.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:02:10
Most exchanges don't support Segwit yet so you'll have to send it to a legacy address if you want to trade your BTC on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:08:21
Actually I'm not. I just find it curious that when someone raises some points this community immediately brings up Bcash like their life depends on it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:25:21
Because it's supposed to be a digital CURRENCY maybe? I know you and many others here just sit on it hoping to get rich, which is fair enough. But the system is focusing on security, what does that even mean? By doing nothing they're focusing on security?
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:07:10
You can send it to a legacy address.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:56:52
Top notch argument. I feel beated. It only takes at least 12 months before a change is passed, but I guess that's perfectly fine isn't it.
But well I'm arguing with a guy who genuinely thinks Bitcoin will hit 1M in 2020 so who am I kidding.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:01:18
No you can’t pay what you want unless you want your transaction stuck. The people who pay the most get in front of you in the “queue”.
We need proper solutions right now and not in a year.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:07:01
Keep playing GTA and LoL in your mommy's basement, friend. Meanwhile I'm counting my gains from selling weeks ago :)
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:20:25
You can send from a segwit to a legacy address and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:49:08
Why would I bother because your agenda is obvious. It's pointless and a waste of time for both of us. You damn well know that what I said was correct but you don't want to hear anything negative.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:46:00
What does Bcash has anything to do with him stating these points?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:46:54
Why is this problem temporary? And don’t say LN because it doesn’t fix the scaling problem.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:41:31
Great arguments once again. I'm wasting my time with you because you're obviously blind. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:45:34
The people who got in at 18-19k deserve to get burned to be honest. Literally the only reason they bought was FOMO and hoping to get rich in a week.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:18:56
Enjoy your mommy's credit card then I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:51:50
That also doesn’t fix it. Even if everyone used segwit transactions we’d still have at least $15 transfers.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:58
I highly doubt that. Judging by the way you're typing and projecting and judging by your post history, you're at most 16 years of age and living with your parents.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:57:29
I think it's "if" they will sell off their Ethereum rather than "when".
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:33:08
Read the OP's post. What does it have to do with Bcash? That is my question, I don't get it why I'm being downvoted for it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:38:52
Don't count on it anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-07-08 11:00:21
This means nothing to me
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:51:16
Only if you look at the market cap, you need such an insane amount of money for it to go x100 at this point you need mass adoption. From $1 to $100 that wasn't needed, and argueably not from $100 to $10k either. You can't just scale exponentially with your market cap forever. Purely looking at market cap you need around 20 trillion dollars to x100 from this point. Where are we going to get that money from? The 1 billion people entering the world of which the majority are born in poor countries? First we need to solve (yes, actually truely solve) the transaction times and transaction costs before the general public will buy anything with Bitcoin at Walmart.
I really get what you're saying but it's important to actually stop and think clearly about where we are now and what it takes to actually get somewhere we want.
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:36:34
If you sell at +10% gains in 24h and buy in -10% in 24hrs you’re almost always making the right decision. At one point you might get burned doing it but the gains you’ve made will more than enough to offset it.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:48:41
Yes, they would dump and buy back at the retrace, which always happens (which will make them an even bigger whale). A bull run with no end doesn’t exist unfortunately
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:57:17
Are you living in Holland?
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:38:57
What does that mean? How do you know that volume is not manipulated? You know they're printing Tether like crazy right?
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:37:50
Thank you for buying my coins mate
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:26:23
You make it sound like a ponzi scheme, knock it off with the "you'll be rich for sure" comments. I'll tell you something: Everyone who posts here is already richer than 95% of the people in the world, let that sink in.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:04:44
Ah okay, if you're not from Europe I don't really have an advice for you because we don't have "taxable events".
All I can say is don't wait for the absolute top, because you will miss it and the exchanges will be overloaded as you said. Sell it when you're up enough and don't be too greedy (don't wait for 100% profit, 80% is very good too!), the exchanges will be online at that point for you to trade.
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:56:06
Can you explain how a 300% price increase in 4 months is organic?
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:38:02
No, because in every bull run new future whales are created. A bull run is also price manipulation but it favors holders / sellers.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:54:02


That part made me laugh. I love your eleborate story and optimism but we’ll see who is right in 10 years, “mate”. I’d love to be proven wrong though.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:29:29
I think you're on the right track then, the best would be to just exchange it for real Euros/Pounds/Whatever if you can, not Tether or something similar. Locking it to fiat rather than stablecoins would be more safe and immediately spendable for whatever,                           but in the end it's up to you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:11:07
This sounds like the beginning of a GTA mission.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:26
Thanks for proving my point exactly. Have a nice day at McDonald's.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:37:42
Judging by your post history the only reason you want to get into BTC is to pay off your debts and get rich. Don't do this, turn away from BTC and never look back if this is your only reasoning.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:22:37
I don't agree with your way of calculating those things, I believe you're missing out on a ton of variables and they're way way way too optimistic (e.g. no scaling issues, near 100% adoption, things like that). Not everything in the world is calculatable. More power to you though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:26:27
It's noobs who bought at $19k and are selling their coin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:27:16
Just get out dude. If it pays that much you wouldn't need to include your affiliate also.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:17:51
Why do real life gold miners no longer use pickaxes? Everybody wants to get a share of the pie by increasing their hash power.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:28:40
Maybe you should, more power to you. I've sold mine 3 years ago.
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:35:45
Tripling the price in 4 months is not organic
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:54:44
So in that case it's more of a safe-keepings asset rather than something to get rich off, which was suggested here above.
If you have 1000$ in holdings today, you will be very lucky if that is $100k in 10 years time. A 100x price increase is unfathomable at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:05:32
I understand it, but just like I said, just because something happened in the past is no guarantee for it to happen in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:57
I love reading all these posts at people who bought at $19k+
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:30:10
Others as in yourself right? You could've at least posted it without an affiliate to make it somewhat believable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:19
Cause you're full of shit. The only time you posted in this subreddit is with this post, the others were shitposting on mainstream subreddits.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:00:49
This comes pretty close I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:30:17
Stay on Twitch and take your $50 dollar investment with you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:02:12
To be fair just because it happened in the past doesn't mean it will continue to do so in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:04:44
Its how literally any other alt coin has legitimacy. I get it you have some stakes in Bcash but no need to shill your own alts here.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:56
Toxic how? I just gave you a suggestion. We both know why you're here, no need to troll.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:37:13
Yep, the people who hold don’t want others to sell, forcing the price up for people who buy after them. Combine that with the fact most people here have Bitcoin and you have your answer.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:08:48
Maybe in time they'll recover but you can bet they're gonna take an enormous beating.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:34:18
So what are you expecting us to do about it? You're pulling way too many conclusions out of your ass. Just go and buy some altcoins, Bitcoin is obviously not for you.
In case you didn't notice, if you don't have at least $500 to move around, transfering isn't even worth it, no matter how much you complain about it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:20
I did but I doubt it's real though. The people who FOMO'd in are going to get burned for a bit now that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:55:25
This is a Bitcoin subreddit not an altcoin subreddit. OP asked to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:56:36
You will notice by the price collapsing by 99%.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:47:41
For doing what exactly this year?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:17:42
Thanks for your contribution nocoiner. While you were a wageslave last year I made $30k while sitting on my ass :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:21:17
You would've earned 5% today by just sitting on your ass and holding your own BTC, like you should.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:20:47
You don’t. Use a different coin if you want smalll and quick transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:49:29
They’ll pay $5000 per transaction
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:42:50
What incoming investigation?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:42:30
It's your own fault for taking advice from people who are solely posting here to give themselves a better financial position.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:51:32
Once you understand most people here want to get their $100 investment increase to a million dollars, there’s really no need to discuss such things here.
This is an echo chamber as said before, if you aren’t 100% positive on the outlooks of Bitcoin you’re gonna get attacked and downvoted to oblivion.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:49:41
20% of the page's requests are ads my Adblocker tells me, LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:10:57
Secretly and maybe not so secretly everyone here wants to be part of the 1%, just like you mentioned in your first post.
Who wouldn’t want a life without any worries coupled with complete freedom? That’s what most of us are looking for here. They see bitcoin as a way to accomplish this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:59:49
Switch banks or let someone else pay for you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:17:56
So why didn't you just buy BCH and send it to your wallet instead of paying the fee and complaining about it here?
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:50:30
Why do you think you can't get on the exchanges? Exodus wallet also uses their infrastructure to swap BTC for something else. Why do you think they won't go down?

The blockchain size would increase too quickly resulting in centralisation.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:47:55
What do you mean? I'm up 1500% since the start of this year.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:24:07
If you look at the charts it says USD-BTC is up 5%. If you can't even phantom that then why are you shilling some meme website to us.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:14:12
It comes from people buying the coin for a higher price than you bought it for.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:58:44
I get such a huge ear-to-ear smile when I spend $30 on a transaction. It doesn't matter for me THAT much since I'm an early investor but I can see the majority of newcomers being pissed about it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:48:15
Not so useful since most people here stepped in after the pump hoping to get rich quick. So for those people it's just another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:15:05
And I'm gonna tell you that because why exactly? Rule number one is you don't even tell anyone how much you have.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:13:26
If saying that past events don't guarantee future events is FUD in your eyes I don't even know what to say to you man.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:32:31
If you want to withdraw to your personal wallet someone has to pay for the network fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:45
Sure you do friend :)
Now go, those burgers aren't going to flip themselves
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:02:48
It won’t, but it will make transactions much faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:05:18
Everyone knows, that's how the Bitcoin blockchain works.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:18:52
Don't do any BTC transaction unless you're moving $1000+.

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:17
That's what you get for buying into the hype, thanks for buying my coins though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:11:57
This has been suggested a million times before and it’s not happening as you can see. At least, not yet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:15:14
I believe the change won’t come because of suggestion but more something that comes naturally.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:42:24
Why do you repeat a joke that’s at least 5 years old?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:01:10
You would've sold at $100 anyway if you kept it at $30, don't kid yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:26:08
No, my recommendation is that when people put in like $100 they shouldn't expect to get rich off it, exactly what this post is about.
And I suggest you read the whitepaper if you think the philosophy of Bitcoin is to hold it forever.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:50:09
Most newcomers here certainly don't have another reason and they will get burned sooner or later. If you're already in debt I'd suggest you don't invest in Bitcoin so you don't make it worse. It can get to $20k, but it most certainly also can go to $5k.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:57:42
You need a different coin if you want to be fully anonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:44:53
Crystal ball or high on whatever, I'd like some of you're having.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:46
Also 99% of the people would sell well before their investment is worth 1 million, that’s also a thing to consider.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:22
So you're gonna tell me I'm a FUDDer instead? Real impressive. You coming across as some sort of cult member scares more people off than people willing to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:55:58
It's better to buy $70 per week or $300 per month because of the additional transaction fees you'd pay.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:48:51
I think he means that you're not going to get rich off of Bitcoin by putting in $100, in which I think he has a pretty decent point.
If he meant you need 30x the investment before it'll be a good one, I disagree with him, but I'm assuming it's the first point I mentioned.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:06:31
For him not being able to retire at age 20.

90% loss compared to fiat. That has definitely changed. Most people are here to get rich, which means needing to cash out to fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:55:11
Ah, an ATH buyer I see.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:06:39
Folllow the original post, I never said 90% loss right now. And no need to speak in such lowly tone to me, it shows your insecurity.
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:00:47
You’re a pretty daft person if you hold through a 90% loss.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:58:08
Im not telling anyone to dump their coins, just having some rational that if you start to see your house burn you might want to sell it before it all burns to the ground.
My comment doesn’t play well with the circlejerk here judging by the downvotes I’m getting. Just a tip to the downvoters: downvoting comments on Reddit doesn’t protect your $100 investment.

So in other words, a useless clickbait article.
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:40:55
If you look at the massive amount of people who FOMO'd in 2017 I'd say the number is closer to 10-20%.
@_date: 2019-11-28 17:08:08
I wouldn't call going from 9k to 7.5k in less than 20 days a bullish outbreak. What's with all these "analysts" analyzing 15 minute candles?
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:24:53
Take your pills bro.
To the OP: No, it's the cheapest to buy it with fiat.
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:37:43
Moral of the story: Don’t believe biased sites which call themselves ‘be in crypto’
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:29:07
It's way over par. The amount of cash injection needed is exponential if you add 30% each year, which at this point is extremely difficult to keep up for years on end.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:10:38
Sure, but that is on the assumption that it does go mainstream. So far the technology and user friendliness is not there yet, especially when it goes about holding your own keys. It's too confusing for your regular Joe. I can't see my parents ever using Bitcoin in its current state for example.
I think your definition of a "small amount of people" is also different than mine. If you're talking about a small amount of people, they also need to be mostly located in rich countries and have savings in order to buy a reasonable amount of it.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:17:28
No. You need market demand in order for the price to increase. It won’t jump to a million in 10 minutes.
@_date: 2019-11-07 11:59:01
So it will hit 60k but not 100k? Why exactly?
@_date: 2019-11-18 19:12:11
If you say anything sceptical about the future price you'll get downvoted. In a way it helps us because people only see "moon" posts and buy at a high price, so I'd just let them be.
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:11:07
Kind of. Depending on the amount of volume a source weighs heavier or lighter. Not exactly sure though, but that would be the most obvious.
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:28:44
Should because of who? Some shill who runs a Bitcoin blog?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:53:24
That's not enough in the grand scheme of things. Look at the volume of BTC. 1700 BTC is around $7 million with almost $3 billion daily volume.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:33:21
No it's not. They don't have the leverage to dump that price by that amount anyway, it takes many thousands BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:42:37

You need this 1% (say ~80 million people) of the world population to be located in rich countries, and that’s quite a lot of people percentage wise when looking at just those countries. I’d say that’s quite something. On top of that, all of those people need to buy a sizeable amount.
And why rich countries? People in poor countries pay a day’s wage just for the transaction cost and other fees. When the network gets more busy it only gets worse. We still have a very long road ahead to land at the situation you’re describing.
And I don’t know how long you want to wait but before my parents’ generation dies off we’re about 30 years later.

True, people see other people selling but there isn't much relation (if any) to the miners selling their coins like they always do.

I'd suggest you don't invest if you don't have that much to invest. Imagine if you put $50 in now, Bitcoin would need to reach $8000+ just for you to earn $50.
Adding to the fact you're still quite young and no experience with trading I'd hold off of it.

Tcp/IP is a transport protocol made to transfer data from one place to another, Bitcoin / Lightning is so different they can’t be compared. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:07:48
No but the final transactions end up in the blockchain sometime. You can connect a $30 phone to use tcp/ip but you can’t (realistically) use it as a Bitcoin node for example.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:53:12
Not every computer connected to the internet needs to store every single bit that’s being transferred

So you’re saying it works exactly the same as TCP/IP? Else you wouldn’t make such comparison. A protocol isn’t infinitely scalable by default. Im sure the devs did a great job with scaling but comparing it to a 40 year old standard the entire internet is built upon is a bit too much in my opinion.

That is what nobody understands here. They also don't understand that you don't wait for a x20 but trade on the swings which will inevitably happen. If it drops to 4K this time, it's fine, just buy it. Sooner or later it will reach 10k again. That's a 2.5x increase, pretty good in my book. The times of sitting on your ass not acting and getting x20 or even higher are over.

Well the other 10% of your uncertainty is the fact in this case. If the market decides gold is worthless tomorrow, all the gold miners are also SOL because they can't sell the gold at a profitable price, as there are no buyers. You need buyers willing to spend your asking price before you can sell something.

That’s true, but a 10x return is already huge. There’s no shame in taking some profit when you have that big of a return and buy back later at a cheaper price.

But your statement isn't true for all the periods though. I'd assume most people jumped on board in late 2017.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:54:25
There's a difference between waiting for a x100 and taking some profit every now and then. A x100 was very, very unlikely, even when BTC was $200. For example, selling when BTC grows 300% in 2 months is a pretty obvious time to take some profit. Sure, the price might continue to rise, but the chance is much higher it will drop from there. It depends more on risk management rather than hoping for financial independence by just holding, which for many will never come unless you already hold thousands of dollars worth of BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:56:07

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:02:33
With $25 you aren’t getting anywhere. I’d suggest buying some every month and keep holding it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:47:46

@_date: 2019-10-07 10:17:23
If BTC goes to $0 it means you would've lost $25. Bitcoin can't go lower than $0.
Steer away from leverage trading if you're already afraid to lose $25.

And now talking realisticly, i think you can really rub your hands if that $25 becomes $500.
We need around (but likely a bit less than) 100 billion to double the price right now and another 200 billion to double it again, just to put it into perspective.
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:13:22
Only people who were willing to spend $20+ transaction fees could send their transaction in a reasonable time. Others had to wait for hours and even days before the mempool cleared a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:34:06
It's still +14% over the last week, chill out. If you bought at 11k it's tough luck for you, that's how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:18:07
When the mempool is so busy as in late 2017 it cannot be used for smaller transactions, you're right. The same thing will happen in any bullrun, you need to send a transaction so big that the transaction cost isn't such a big deal (e.g. $1000+, assuming $20 per transaction).
Note that a lot of people do not use those transactions but just buy on things like Coinbase and leave it there.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:36:23

Check end of 2017 like OP is referring. And it was most definitely true because I was also sending transactions during that time and saw the same issue.
@_date: 2019-12-10 15:05:02
Also to add - it was actually easier to buy BTC in 2016 since you didn't get KYCed out the ass. Just to reassure you, if we hit 20k in 2021 that's still almost a 3x increase from where we are now. Not that many assets can say the same.

For anyone who doesn't want to disable adblocker (like me):
One of the most important features of bitcoin and other PoW (Proof of Work) coins/tokens is that there is a cap on the number of coins that will ever be in circulation. The creation of new bitcoins can be predicted accurately and is transparent to everyone. This is different from the banking world, where central banks can print unlimited money.
An important term in the bitcoin world that comes with this is the block halving. What does this mean exactly, and why is this important? We will use Bitcoin (BTC) as example to explain but same applies to other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Zcash, Digibyte and many more.
Everything you want to know about Bitcoin block halving.
To understand Bitcoin block halving it is useful to know how new bitcoins are created.
Bitcoin has a limited amount of coins that can be created. A total of 21 million bitcoins will eventually be put into circulation. A little less actually, to be precise, a total of 20,999,999,9769 bitcoin will be created. These bitcoins are released at a predictable rate by means of block rewards.
A block reward is a reward for miners. Miners play an important role in the bitcoin network. They ensure that the transactions are verified, processed in a block and added to the blockchain. This is a fairly technical process. It is important to know that this process takes a lot of computer power and electricity.
The investment by miners of special built computers (example antminer) and electricity/power ensures that the network is well protected. Miners don’t do this for nothing. They receive a reward for this. This reward is issued in the form of bitcoins and is called the block reward.
Currently, the pay per block is 12.5 bitcoins. This reward is halved approximately every four years. This halving is called the bitcoin block halving. Curious when the next halving is? You can check out this page where a countdown clock is available.
What is a bitcoin block halving?
The bitcoin block halving is the moment when the reward for miners is halved. This halving takes place every 210,000 blocks. How long does it take to get there? Miners add a block to the blockchain every ten minutes on average . Based on this data, a bitcoin block is halving approximately every four years.
What does the bitcoin block halving mean for miners?
Creating bitcoin is expensive. It costs computer power and lots of electricity. Miners earn money when their income exceeds the costs. With costs you can think for example of electricity costs, hardware, and insurance of the hardware.
The bitcoin block halving ensures that the reward in bitcoin halves every four years. In this way, miners know precisely the day/time when the reward in bitcoin is halved. In that respect, the block halving provides more certainty for miners. But there is also uncertainty. The delivery time of mining equipment has been unstable for years, just like the computing power on the network. 
But on the other hand, halving the reward in bitcoin does not necessarily mean halving the reward in euros or dollars. Does the demand remain constant and is the supply growth slowing down? Then the price can rise in the future. But the role of transaction costs can also become greater. In this way, miners still receive sufficient compensation for their work.
What happens to the reward after a bitcoin block halving?
After a block halving, the number of bitcoins that the miners receive when they find a block is halved. They first received 50 bitcoins for each block, then it became 25 bitcoins and now the reward is 12.5 bitcoins. What value this represents in a fiat currency (EUR/USD/GBP) depends on the current market rate.
Bitcoin halving historical chart
Some traders believe that the bitcoin block halving directly influences the price. In 2012, for example, the first halving took place. A year later, bitcoin reached an all-time high. This also happened the year after the next halving, in 2017.
How is that possible? Currently, approx 1,800 bitcoins are mined every day. The vast majority are sold directly by the miners to cover the costs of their equipment. Is the reward cut in half? Then the sales pressure decreases. This could have positive results for the price of bitcoin.
Will this also happen at the next halving? Cryptocurrencies are extreme volatile and remains unpredictable we really can’t predict what will happen with the next halving.
What happens after the very last block halving?
After the last bitcoin block halving, miners no longer receive a block reward. They will then only earn bitcoins through transaction costs. Transaction costs will therefore become increasingly important in the future.
But will transactions also become more expensive in the future? That is not necessarily necessary. There are developments on the bitcoin network to keep transaction costs manageable.
An example is the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network ensures that transactions are executed in a second layer on the blockchain and not on the blockchain itself.
Smaller transactions will probably take place on this network in the future. The transaction costs for this type of transaction are not high. This way, bitcoin transactions remain affordable/low cost in the future.
But this is all in a far away future. We will not even experience the last bitcoin block halving ourselves. According to calculations, the last bit of bitcoin will be mined in 2140.

300% increase in 2 years is not really run off the mill, even less so 4000% increase in 5 years. The higher the risk you take the higher the potential return, 5 years ago AMD was pretty much dead in the CPU market. I was talking in comparison to relatively 'safe' assets.

Less transactions going on.

Why didn't you sell when it was 12k this year? Set an alert on your phone next time if you don't want to be constantly checking price.

Read his post, it's about the end part of 2017, you're not winning anything except the making yourself look like an idiot award. Next time actually go into discussion at hand, it will make you look smarter.
If you want to redeem yourself, answer OP's question about what to do when the network becomes congested again, it will help everyone much more.

Well if you bought at 18k, absolutely.

How can you tell that if you don't even know how much he has now? For all you know he invested $200. You'll never be a millionaire from BTC with that. But those people are needed for the people with some actual coins to get rich, that's true.
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:19:37
Nice $5550 support level you got there
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:32:19
Yes really, you need more money to go from 7k to 340k than from 700USD to 19k. Not rocket science. We'll see if enough people want to buy to reach that level, which I doubt.
@_date: 2019-04-14 07:24:46
It won’t. It means $500k for 1 bitcoin. That’s a bit too far out of the realistic ball park.
But let’s say it is realistic. How many years will that take? 10? 20? That’s quite some time for only 10k, which after that time would be worth a ton less because of USD inflation.
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:56:57
You can definitely still get rich from crypto but it requires trading. Wait for the next big wave like in 2017, dump somewhere around the top and repeat that 2-3 times. It will take some years but it’s possible.
Note: it’s only possible when you already have a reasonable position. If you invest $100 now you’re not going anywhere.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:10:17
The same of course, it’s been a month kid. If you didn’t “hodl” you would have tripled your bitcoin.

Don't invest so much if you have no idea how the market works.

That's what you get when you buy at the peak of an unnatural growth.

Only the chance that it doubles a hunderd or a thousand times is pretty much 0, unlike the early investors.

@_date: 2018-02-03 00:05:03
Why are you accusing me of something? I was just telling my point in general.
I mad hunderds of percentage of profits over the years I’m in crypto. I’m just saying the people who are joining now probably won’t see their investments increase tenfolds, even though a lot of them are convinced it will.

Hodl is pretty bad for your finances unless you bought 3 years ago.

Bitpay is a company so they also need to make money somehow.

Right, that's why your name is "bitcoin_to_da_moon" and the price fluctuates every month by 20%.
But I guess not much point in explaining it to someone with no reading comprehension.

This is the funniest post chain I've seen in a while here on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:53:34
If you don't have a history of large transactions they can call you out on it. It happened to me before but after I told them it was okay they no longer bothered me about it. Hope they same will be for you.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:57:31
Big yikes
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:33:01
Yes, this is an asset where you're 100% guaranteed to make money. That's why everyone and your mom are buying it. Oh, wait...
@_date: 2019-09-30 08:32:05
You want to trade it for something that it worth more than what it is now. If not, you might as well put your money in an index fund and be happy with a 5% rise every year to somewhat combat inflation. 
In order to make it worth more, the value of the asset has to rise somehow. So what do you do? You sell it for more to the greater fool (who is also hoping to make big bank)
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:10:33
Imagine buying at that price and falling for the hodl meme.

It probably will be if you're happy with a 1.5x or 2x return. Next pump won't be a 10x that's one thing that's for sure.

PSA: everyone prepare for a $50 dump, buy the dip!
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:24:28
You're supposed to sell your Bitcoin to the greater fool. I know that's what people don't want to hear around here but 99% of them absolutely want this. For 99% (I'm pretty sure you too) it's about making big dollars, not so much Bitcoin getting adoption. You don't need mass adoption in order to see a price increase, it's been shown again and again in the past.
My advice: If you believe there are no more greater fools, then sell everything right now and get into some other investment.
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:49:57
No, because for every buyer there needs to be a seller.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:40:46
Imagine being so insecure and snarky you fall into projecting and thinking I want to shill some "shitcoin". I never mentioned that anywhere, just index funds. And FYI, index funds don't have anything to do with crypto, I just gave them as an example for passive income. I'm just saying what I've learned from 5 years of making money in this space.

People who are invested will tell you to buy, trolls will tell you to stay away from it. Make up your own mind, it’s better in the long run.

Hope you learned your lesson not to buy the top next time. The minute it enters mainstream media you have to stop buying.
