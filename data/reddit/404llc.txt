blockchain.info is a fantastic site, we're trying to simplify the basics of bitcoin transactions and increase cryptocurrency adoption among less technical users.

Bitcoinwallet.com enforces 2FA on every account, log-in and transaction, proof of reserves, proof of liability.

Thanks abrkn, we're on it.

User name buttcoin is still available at bitcoinwallet.com, but not for long!
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:17:27
Of course!
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:25:41
Thanks IkmoIkmo, you should have seen how bad the design was on the first two attempts!  We'll get the design sorted out, we were focused on the functionality for this first release.  We have a long time horizon on the  improvements we have planned.

I tried a middle aged hacker living with his mother in a third world country and it didn't work out well.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:30:31
Actually we didn't.

We are hiring in fact.

We're intent on protecting user's that arrive at a page that presents itself as something it really isn't by displaying an obfuscated version of the email address that was used to activate the account.  If you think you're on the official Red Cross page and you see it was created by ***** run away (and let us know).  We do offer account manual validation as a service.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:41:20
Now you can see what we did with it.

I appreciate it axefrog.  We contracted a designer that did two mockups that were better than the rubbish design our engineers and myself could manage.  At that point the designer went AWOL and we had to interpret how the two mockups would have been applied to the 30+ pages that we didn't have a design for.  We're working with a pair of designers and html5 developers to pull things together and get us mobile in the same effort.  As I've mentioned our time horizon for this site is long, and not to make excuses, we didn't expect anything near the response that was generated from two domain name based articles that we didn't even know were being written.  Our soft launched went ballistic within 24 hours.  On the one hand that's a great indicator for us, on the other hand I'm not exactly having the time of my life reading all these design comments!

Hey _vjy here is a user's page that has alt coin addresses on it.  
We don't have any control over those external addresses nor do we ask for the private key, we simply allow users to list them on their page so that anyone that visits their user name can make a payment to the user in the currency they prefer.

Fiatleak.com owner here.  We tested the huobi.com feed on the site this morning.  It will go live tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-05-28 03:36:23
Agreed, bitcoinwallet.com uses real time proof of solvency at the enterprise and user level.  The independent auditor is everyone.
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:16:38
What exchange?
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:10:41
Send me a PM to discuss including your exchange on fiatleak.com 
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:45:11
Fixed, PM me your bitcoin address and we'll send you a bug bounty reward.
@_date: 2014-05-05 05:21:52
bitcoinwallet.com is in.
@_date: 2014-01-14 05:14:47
It's true that Fiatleak is one of the sites, but we are building out three others.  
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:19:42
We had a problem with the keypoolrefill function and ran out of addresses to assign from the bitcoin node.  We believe we've corrected the issue,  if you have a minute and can try again we'd appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-04-07 03:55:47
Hey guys my name is Price Givens, I'm a founder of bitcoinwallet.com.  You can verify my reddit account at  
We had a surge of new users in the past two hours that exhausted the keypool on our bitcoin nodes and keypoolrefill wasn't running correctly. We believe we have addressed that issue.  New users are coming in again and we're watching the situation.   
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:01:10
Congratulations to blockchain.info for owning the problem.  They've just defined the playbook for how other bitcoin services should respond to crisis.

@_date: 2014-04-07 06:33:12
Absolutely exercise caution, you don't know me and trust doesn't happen quickly.  Even if you don't choose to deposit any bitcoin to your wallet we think there's benefit for you in selecting a great user name to represent all your bitcoin and alt coin addresses.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:41:02
It's a good point, we bought bitcoinwallet.com specifically because of our intent to apply user-friendly names as sub-domains.

We aren't a U.S. based company and we're treating contributors as contractors.

IkmoIkmo We've been developing for the past two months, and during that time I've seen every reddit post calling for a more user friendly substitute for bitcoin addresses (it happens about once a week).  Each time my heart rate redlined because I knew that it would be done very very soon.  The reddit community is a filled with brilliant minds that I respect tremendously and I knew we didn't have a large window to come to market with our solution.  Multi-sig is in that same category, it's proper implementation is the holy grail.  We have our solution to multi-sig in development, but it's not a simple thing to deliver in a very intuitive way.
Our goal has always been to make bitcoin less intimidating and more accessible to non-technical people.  We also wanted to facilitate transactions as small as a satoshi between users without fee or delay.  That meant going off blockchain and, at least for that particular feature, pooling funds at the outset.  We aren't dedicated to off block chain or holding private keys, it just makes the features we launched with possible.  Off blockchain allows features that we're developing like this escrow  
We're rolling out advanced wallet options for users to generate paper based wallets where we don't hold the private keys.  But every feature we make has to be done dead simple for the user.  I've just put up a wall of text so let me know what else you're interested in.

Kind of, you can select any individual exchange and only see their transactions.  
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:07:43
great setup guys, thanks for putting [fiatleak.com]( in the most prominent position of your trade desk!
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:50:36
Wow!  Can you include your bitcoin address?  
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:56:11
If you earn $.01, you get paid $.01.  There is no blockchain fee.  There is no transaction fee.  Maybe you should just try it.
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:39:49
It might not be worth it to you but other's seem to appreciate it.  We DO send it to your bitcoin account every day without you requesting it.
- Daily payments
- No minimum amount
The way we are able to send as little as 1 satoshi to anyone, every day is because we use BitcoinWallet.com.  They allow immediate user-to-user transactions for free at any amount.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:46:32
This guys posts the coolest images.  He wins today.
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:54:55
I read it, that was a really REALLY thorough analysis.  I really appreciate all the thought you put into it.  I'm going to spend more time going through it line by line and will let you know if we implement any of your suggestions.  Thanks! 
Also I recently launched another site you might want to take a look at: [File.Army]( pays people bitcoin to post and share images...you should try it
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:53:01
Thanks for the note - something was hanging up GZIP.  Fixed.  The images are hosted at S3, checking the options there.  
The site is very fast here.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:52:48
File.Army doesn't charge a transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:13:08
Thanks for the heads up, leaking resumed.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:45:08
Isn't it better to be paid every day than once per month?
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:15:50
Amazing, I just sent you some bitcoin as gratitude
@_date: 2016-12-31 22:47:24
Welcome, just sent you some gratitude!
