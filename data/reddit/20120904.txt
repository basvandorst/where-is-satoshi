When even 10% of the public owns a cryptocurrency, then we can talk about that.

Yes. They have until the end of 2017 to come after you.

We used CoinPayments.net but due to their TERRIBLE instability (constant 500's, even lost a few payments), we switched to BitPay, only to discover knee-deep in the development that none of our devs had BIP-70 compatible wallets!
Upon launch of BitPay, our crypto payments dropped off 90%+ and we even went an entire month without a single crypto payment (which was startling to upper management).
What I ended up deving was a JS scrapper that grabs the Bitpay Invoice URL which, when it's passed the correct HTTP Header gives the BIP-70 URI. Then, using a JS BIP-70 decoder, we decode the BIP-70 to a BIP-21 legacy address.
THEN we inject JS right besides the BitPay window that says "Don't have a BitPay compatible wallet? Use this QR code!" and then sales resumed.
I'm pretty sure BitPay has lost &gt; 50% of their actual revenue since the Dec 2017 switch.
P.S. A month later, BitPay audited us and compelled us to take this down. Now, we're thinking about using that drop-in BitPay replacement project...

By your own words, you're over the limit by $6,000 AUD?

At the same exact moment, I kept thinking, "Man.. I REALLY NEED to buy 1,000 DASH @ $8.11/coin so I can run a supernode!" But nope! It hit $1,500 REAL FAST!

Do you mean that I cannot parse your English statement / question / run-on? No, I cannot.

I remember selling $65,000 worth of 62.5 BTCs in January 2017 when it hit $1,000 for the second time ever.
One of the worst mistakes of my life! At the time, I thought "I'll sell now, and buy back at $800." NOPE!

80% of my paycheck goes into Bitcoin.
When it appreciates, I buy more stuff, when it depreciates, I pretend it's 2008 all over again.

Funny, this was done for Usenet to host binary movies decades ago... Same exact argument!

I believe strongly in BCH. I have bought it continuously since it first started and I truly believe that one segwit hiccup and BCH will value rise very sharply.
By the same token coin [pun intended], I definitely think B2X is doomed for quick obsolescence.

Let the noob try to catch the katana.
After he loses an arm or a leg, or both, he'll hopefully learn better.

That guy just got *tortured* and **murdered** in Africa because he spotted his mouth off like this!

This is a perfect sign of a market bottom.
I remember people saying I was -insane- for loading up on Ford at $3.50/share in 2009. I sold in 2015 @ $15!

Be greedy when others are fearful, and vice versa. I bought at $350 and sold at $17,500.
