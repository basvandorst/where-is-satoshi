Yea, he meant if Greece continued to use the Drachma, they could have devalued the currency (money printing) to get out of debt; however with the Euro, they can not and are stuck in financial serfdom to the rest of the Eurozone.

Any charting software will have an option to plot the y-axis in logarithmic terms.  Look at 'y-axis options' in whatever software you are using.
Log charts allow you to see true relative differences in prices.  None of this meaningless linear bullshit.

Should be on a logarithmic y-axis; otherwise the size of the bars is misleading.  100% up is equal and opposite to 50% down.  Don't know who this "market ahead" group is, but their charts should never be trusted - they don't know what they're doing.

Why in the world did you engrave that the (transparent) plate is 999 fine copper?

*"allows for"
"allows for" has the more precise meaning of "permits" or "enables" which is more fitting in this sentence, as it is not the writing that is doing the allowing; rather the writer is allowing the scrutiny, and their writing is allowing for scrutiny.

Based on activity, looks like an exchange address.  Probably the guy's Coinbase wallet.
