Maybe do a quick Google search? I guess there was a transaction that is showing twice, but only really went through once. What sort of wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:51
oh damn - so you lost it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:13
I wouldn’t say I was being selfish, but I do agree that investing it all was a bad idea and OP should get out.

Hey, that's super neat! I noticed the twitter feed breaks your SSL though because of the images. 
Let me know if you'd like some help, this is really cool! :)

It sounds like you don’t understand why it exists. That’s fair enough, it’s not usually obvious to most. Right now, there’s no real reason for you to use bitcoin, but there will be. 
Go ask google the same thing you’re asking here, and you’ll get your answer :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:47:32
Are you saying bitcoin specifically or all crypto currencies?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:29
You’re in panic mode because you’re so invested in it. Don’t sell, please. No one knows what’s going to happen, but I’d be holding on until it goes back up, and it looks like it will. This dip is expected.

Just fuckin' buy bitcoin m8

I’m only new to all this tbh so I can’t help ;( 
Maybe email them?

Sell? That's a funny way to pronounce hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:26:56
Oh yeah cool man.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:10:27
Replace bit and satoshi with dollars and cents. Or even euros and euro cents. It’s literally just another currency, it’s not a hard thing to grasp
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:04:59
Just buy and hodl my dude. A 1k/2k dip right now won't mean jack when it skyrockets to 100k+

I've verified on a few different platforms, all within 24 hours. Maybe try a different place?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:11:28
I doubt it'll be higher, but if not it will be lower.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:16:30
I did not know this :/
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:22:35
It will probably go up unless it comes down.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:12:10
It was almost as wild as bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:07:40
What the fuck? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:46:54
Yeah, I realise that now but I didn’t ever consider what that truly meant.

As a web developer, how could I get in contact with someone there that needs work?
@_date: 2018-11-29 08:41:04
What’s a scam? Bitcoin or Crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:35:28
How many coins did you have? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:52:23
100k my dude.

What kind of Bitcoin news site doesn't have an SSL certificate in 2018? Seems kind of ironic, doesn't it?
