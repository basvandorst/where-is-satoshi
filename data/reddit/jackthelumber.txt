I like this (very unlikely) scenario better: He saved all his coins for the moment when some big goverments cooperate and try to ban bitcoins worldwide by FUD and by declaring them illegal.
He then steps forwards and provides the possibility to prove your identity via any means (web of trust, proof-of-passport,...) and receive a certain amount of bitcoin, which will likely be more than a years earning then.
And then the gov's should try to explain to you, that you are not allowed to use this with all other millions of people now using bitcoin, but rather use their dieing money they print all along. Good luck.

Is only true, if you delete your other key. And even then its not really safe, as the private key has been on a internet-connected device. So you cant call it cold-storage any more.

Its hard to compress cryptographic data (i.e. hashes in the case of bitcoin), because on one of the important properties of hashes is, that the output is not distinguishable from random data.
And one feature of random data is, it is not (good) compress able. Because compression relies on non-randomness of data.

Just a  thought: I think the random obfuscation should have (nearly) the same pixel-size as the QR-code it is hiding. Otherwise it might be possible to extract the QR code with an FFT-Filter. (not tested).
And maybe also add a second noise-pattern left to the first, so that both of them are stacked, when the paper wallet is folded.

They dont run on the USB stick - you only store the binaries for it on the Stick. You always need something which runs the software (i.e. a computer)

Sorry to disappoint, but I think i did this survey some weeks ago - but dont remember where i got the link from.
Imho, the options you see on the screenshot depend on a question asked before, like "What other payment systems did you use" - Bitcoin wasnt even a option. But there was an "other" selection and a textbox. 
All selected options including the "other" get questioned in the following pages, like seen in the screenshot. So, if he would entered "ass pennies" into the "other" field, it would also work.

A bit OT, but maybe some points for your maybe upcomming debates.

"Debt-based money creation" vs. "Debt-free money creation" -&gt; might this have impacts on "need for economic growth" -&gt; "environment protection" and the way we measure economic whealth.
And also in the same boat: what is the difference if I have debt-based money creation where we have to pay interrest on the created money vs. not.
(Here i dont mean saving-interrests, but rather interrests paid on debt which only exists for the means of creating money, i.e. govt. bonds)

In my opinion the most important difference to fiat is: Moneycreation in the Bitcoin system is not debt-based.
If fiat money is created, it always represents debt, which accumulates intrests and actually needs to be payed back someday. If a BTC is mined it just 'exists' and can be used as a token. No initial debt against some central bank or giral money.
@_date: 2012-08-27 18:05:31

why do you want regular backups? You only need to backup, when the wallet generates new private keys - and per default there are 100 Keys pregenerated.
So you can click 100 times on "create new address", before anything in your wallet changes.
@_date: 2012-08-27 12:44:37
I find it important to note the difference that our "normal" fiat money is dept-based (i.e. creation of money always equals new dept), where as BTC is dept free in its creation. Just like gold. You need work to get to it, but if it is found, it can used as "token". There is no intrinsic dept on each created BTC.

* use money which definitely becomes worth more or at worst stays the same

And also the retarget algo is built that way, that it estimates the average rate of the last 2016 blocks and adjusts the diff, so that this hashrate would lead to 2016blocks =&gt; 14d.
But as now the hashrate rises quite fast, this estimate is not correct. If the rate would stay quite stable in 14d, it would work better.
But as 14d is an arbitrary number, why it shouldnt be 9d?
The total amount of Bitcoins stays unaffected.

Cognitive Dissonance. Our brain is trained to hold onto believes/systems/models which have proven to work in the past. This is an essential trait to survive in a time where technologic advance wasn't really fast and our surrounding not so dynamic. As we are now approaching the 'singularity' this trait often blocks our view onto new information or marks them as simply wrong.

Treat yourself well with that money - but also try to invest some portion of it, into creating a better world.
I really hope many of the early-adopters, which will get very rich sooner or later are those idealistic good guys, which try to make the world a better place for all - who would never have gathered that much money in our current system. As their world views would have prevented them from it.

If you have some millions $ to spare and dont care to lose them, buy slowly Bitcoins, get the price high. 
Than dump all of them once, so the price dumps down. Many people who got in when the price was high will loose a lot of money. This will get much bad media for bitcoin, which again might bring the price further down.
Rinse and repeat.

Their chain of arguments was flawed from the beginning: "There is no law which declares Bitcoin legal" -&gt; "Bitcoin is illegal"

In a constitutional state everything is legal, unless it is declared illegal by any law. And not the other way round.

I am not sure, what the definition of market cap here is, but it is wrong to believe, that all bitcoins in existence are worth $2bn. Only at the current price... But if you go to sell "all" bitcoins, the price would go down very fast.
Also it is wrong to believe that $2bn flowed into the bitcoin network - as most bitcoins were bought at a much lower rate.

Print a paperwallet on a secure computer (make ~3 copies), send about 8 BTC there. Hide the paper wallets (from thieves and from you panic selling)
Play with the remaining 2 BTC. Shop something, donate something, buy altcoins, whatever...
Every time you buy new Bitcoins send some (say 10%) to this paperwallet.

One point often missed, which imho is also a good selling point for deflationary currencies:
If you know that the same money will buy you more, when you save it and buy it later, you have a incentive to evaluate if you really need that product now or later or if maybe you dont need it at all...
When we hear that in the current market, everyone shrugs and says, that this will kill the economy. But if you take a step back and look at the previous sentence again... 
     You only buy/use stuff, you really need.
If this is valued wrong by the current economy than maybe its the wrong economy after all.
Deflationary currencies will help us saving resources, working time, emissions and ecology for free - now we have to actively regulate to save our mother earth. With bitcoin, you get this as a free by-product.
