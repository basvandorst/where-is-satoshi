Right now trading around 390 USD - 400 USD on huobi , nearly a 10% gap on trading between exchanges.

Big volume is always a good attraction and these Chinese exchanges have 0% trading fees but this is only a minor factor I believe.

Big deal for Bitcoin in general! The adoption is spreading well.

Let's put an end to this Ponzi propaganda! Big press coverage are mentioning it more and more trying to scare people away from Bitcoin.

Adoption for bitcoin is increasing at such a rapid pace lately. Future looks good

That's crazy and this will definitely attract more people into it not mentioning the publicity it makes for Bitcoin.

There is not much out there right now that have picked my attention, but ill share with you some of my holdings ( based on my own beliefs) that I think could eventually pay out in the longterm. It's rare to see any new coins bring new techs right now so I believe more in those who are services based for now.
1-Gemscoin ( based on their messenger app still in beta)
2-AmberCoin ( a coin backed by Amber mined asset)
3-Viral ( a kind of advertising network created where the dev is burning supply as he receives new advertisers- 25% tota burned up to now)
4- RMS ( this one is pretty much low key - an online hiring tool resumeo.me , I have no expectation for them but ill let you make your own research)
 99% of altcoins are shitty but some of them could luckily bring some profit at some point.
Good luck.

hoping other countries will not follow the same destructive law, could be dangerous too.

thank you for the correction, French Canadian here! The thing is when it comes to big companies they are often backed on a daily basis. But the smaller companies, they don't believe they will be the target of these hackers and often neglect the backup process.

lol close enough

Indeed he did some good work.

It's my own conclusion. Have you heard of QIWI? Russian involved? heavily backed?
