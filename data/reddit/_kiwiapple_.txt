I'm not selling any of my BTC until we hit the $500,000 mark. i can patiently wait few weeks that it's gonna take to get there. Even then I'll only sell little bit of it. My hope and dream is that I won't ever have to sell BTC for fiat. I hope someday we can just use BTC without having to convert.

I don't have 2 btc. But I do have a x amount of btc? 
Say I have .10 btc. What can I do with that on LN? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:13:03
I'm an avid supporter of bitcoin and I  look forward to LN. But I am also a realists. LN transactions aren't truly bitcoin transactions. We do need on chain scaling. Here's why. If all transactions are done in LN, which I think will be the case, as nobody wants to pay any fee, then miners would not have any reason to mine anymore. If they don't mine, no transactions will ever get recorded on the blockchain. And bitcoin will become millions of sidechains of LN transaction. 
Eventually, we must have good on chain scaling on main bitcoin chain. No way around it. In say few years, price of bandwidth will drop. I hope. Price of storage is negligible now. At that time we do need bigger blocks. 
We don't need to hate big blocks. We need to hate bad implementation of big blocks and bad timing. Time for bigger block will come. LN can only delay if for a while.

You can. But that will kind of defeat the whole offline hardware storage. Say you restore your hardware wallet on software wallet on your pc. And you pc is infected. Maybe it is or maybe it isn't. Maybe there's a keylogger. You just exposed your seeds to a entire planet, considering most computers, phones, etc are always connected to internet. 
If you're okay with this risk, you can do it. But I wouldn't personally. I'd rather get another hardware wallet and try it on that. If you have significant amount in your hardware wallet, you should never ever restore you wallet on a connected pc. Never. But if you must, make sure you turn of your wifi, bluetooth, etc. Still don't do it. I wouldn't.

Haha. I see that you are trying really hard to justify and rationalize your hate. 
Most people are born into a religion. They grow up with that religions. to them religions isn't a choice. It's who they are. And besides it doesn't matter if religion is a choice or ideology. Because you are still hating a group of people. That's racism. Also nationality is a choice. Sure you might be born into a nation but you can by choice change your nationality. Millions of people do every year. Yet hating/discriminating people based on a choice-nationality-is racism.  Likewise hating people for what the believe is racism. We are talking about your hate of Muslims here. That's racism. We are not talking about your hate of Islam. Or hate of religion in general. 
To show you the stupidity of your ways, skin color is a choice also. Sure you might have been born with certain color. But you can choose to change your skin-color. If you're white, you can get tan. Your president is white but he change his color to  orange. Michel Jackson was born black. He chose to change his skin color to white. There's a whole industry worth billions that deals with skin color changing. I guess you are going to say hating people for their skin color isn't racism since skin color can be changed through choice. Do you see how stupid your position is? Probably not. Racist folks aren't know for being self-aware and the banality of their argument.

You don't just open up a database. Dubai could have whatever blockchain they have on hosted on nodes spread across the world.

In addition to above post, you can also have multiple wallet with different passphrase. Let say your passphrase is ONE. Someone forces you to reveal you passphrase. And you give then your passphrase of ONE. And you have say $100 on that wallet. But they don't know you can also type in passphrase TWO and get a completely different wallet. And that wallet would have your bigger stash. 
You can have many, many wallet on the same device. (Each wallet contains many, many private+public key combo)

Bitcoin needs bigger block, segwit adoption, and off-chain scaling. Segwit can be done really quickly. All we need is coinbase and gdax to adopt it and everyone to insist on segwit address. Of chain scaling will require several more months to a year. And bigger blocks would require few more months. We needn't lock ourselves with one solution.

Coinbase is a bad company for cryptos especially bitcoin. Their only redeeming quality is easy access and familiarity.
Bitcoin needs bigger blocks, this much is true. Sure LN will help. But LN won't solve onchain scaling issue. We need to seriously promote bigger blocks for bitcoin. Or else we'll lose out in the end. The dream of bitcoin going to $1000000 won't be realized with paltry 1.3mb blocksize. We need big blocks and low fee. You can get that with bcash but you get Roger Ver with it. No thanks. We want bitcoin with bigger block. Anyone listening?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:28:03
Let me see if I can explain: Bitcoin is basically a public ledger. You have a copy of it, I have a copy of it, Sue has a copy of it, and Bob has a copy of it. Everyone has a copy of it. In theory. And let's say everyone has 1 bitcoin. Now what's stopping me from updating my ledger and saying I have 1000 btc? Nothing. I would update my ledger to 1000 and everyone will just have to accept it. But you see there's something wrong with that. If this was true, bitcoin wouldn't work. I could update my ledge to 1000 and you could update yours to 10000. Or more. So what I have to do is solve a mathematical equation-has function. Do do that, I'd have to do literally trillions of calculation. And that requires a lot of computer work and energy. So after spending a tonne of money on electricity, I've given the right to update the ledger. Because I spent all these energy and time, I'm given 12.5 bitcoin. And when I am given the right to update the ledger, I'm given a block. In that block, I can update Sue's balance to be 1.4 btc, bob's balance to be .5 btc, because Bob sent sue .4 btc. But when Bob sent Sue .4 btc, he sent me .1 btc because I'm gonna include him in my block. So I got 12.5 btc, plus Bob's .1. Now I get to update the blockchain and a block. And now anyone who has the copy of the blockchain must update their copy with what I updated because I updated it after having spent done lots of work/hash function. 
This is how I explained it to my mother and she got it. Feel free to ask me or us more question.

Several reasons. 1) It's not on-chain scaling. You still need to open and close on on bitcoin main chain. If you are like me, who'd wants to open and close LN channels right away, we are really doing bitcoin mainchain transactions. So for us, there wouldn't be much of benefit. 2) Each LN is basically, imo, another token-coin riding on the bitcoin network. Reminds me of all the shit-token from ethereum world. 
I've see LN  and I used LN. It's amazing. You can literally make a  1 penny transaction instantly. But I haven't seen or tested a channel being closed and how long it takes to close. I hope to do this someday in the next few days. 
I'm not one of those big block only fix guy. I'm all for Lightening Network. But I also want zero or few unconfirmed transaction on main mempool. I also want to to bitcoin transaction with reasonable fee and time. I want my cake and I want to eat it too. I want big blocks, faster transactions, more transaction, little to no fee on main chain. I also want near instant transaction on LN and near no fee. Eventually we need to have bigger blocks. 
I fully understand increasing blocksize just pushes the problem down the line. But what if the down the line is far enough that we don't have to worry about it. What if we have 16mb blocks. That should keeps us *solvent* for 5-10 years, I think. With segwith that would be 32mb. After we exhaust that, get bigger blocks. No, we won't grow blocks by infinite mb. There aren't infinite number rof people in the world doing infinite number of transactions.

Nothing really transfer when you restore to another wallet. Let me see if i can explain this to you. Let say I ask you to give me a random number. And you give me your random number to be 7815644543654.
Then I tell you that your first wallet private key is 
7815644543654 + 45*9
and the next one is
7815644543654 + 45*10
and the next one is 
7815644543654 + 45*11
and 7815644543654 + 45*12
As long as I have your seed number "7815644543654", I can generate your private keys in America, Russia, or China, or Djibouti or Malaysia or anywhere. 
Think of the 12-word or 24-word seed word as your "7815644543654"  seed number from above. And think of America, Russia, China, etc as different hardware wallet. 
If I create your private key in America and then go to Russia and create it, the only thing I'm using is the original seed number 7815644543654. I'm not physically transferring anything between Russia and America. 
And that's why you used a passphrase in another wallet, you didn't see anything. And when you went home, your old device still had everything. If your passphrase worked, your old device would still have it. Every-time you connect your device and type in your passphrase, the device is literally recreating all of your private keys. 
Passphrase is also case sensitive. If you type in A vs a, you are gonna get a whole new wallet.

Thank you friend. But I take offense to the word "gamble" when people say that's what it is with bitcoin. Although I understand that all investments have an aspect of chance/gambling in it. To me gambling is playing the roulette table. And buying bitcoin is not an gamble but an investment. I didn't go in bitcoin simply because I thought I had 50-50 chance. I went in having researched as much as I could and I saw that this was a solid investment. 
Thanks anyways for your well-wishes. :) Hope you also gained much and if not then I hope you will in near future. Keep doing good and the universe will calculate a good outcome for you.

Why not? Think of your passphrase as your 25th seed words. And that 25th word doesn't have to be from the list of BIPS48 list. It can be any alphanumeric word or even sentence. It has a length limit, I think. 
Any passphrase you enter will give you a wallet. You can try this if you have a hardware wallet with passphrase enabled. One time enter a wrong passphrase. You will get a wallet. And that wallet will  be empty. No fund. But you can add some fund to it. And you can give this passphrase when you are tortured. You don't have to give your main passphrase that has your main wallet.

I think Roger Ver might have some mental sickness. If you put everything together, he seems utterly insane. The sad part is millions of people are going to be defrauded by him and lose millions of dollars. That said bitcoin does need bigger block and scale up. LN is nice. But on chain scale up is necessary in the coming months. Either that or  we discourage people from using bitcoin. When userbase goes down and the number of transaction will go down and so will confirmation time will also go down.

Tax-cuts  that provide tax reduction to the wealthy are anti-humanism. Taxes aren't theft. Taxes are taxes. You need to pay it to live in society and enjoy all the things that it brings. Suppose for a second that you live in a country that has no taxes and no revenue of any sorts. How the fuck do roads get built? Also suppose you live in a country with zero tax and you are still a poor fuck. How do you children get basic education? Suppose you live in a country with zero tax and your neighboring country decides to invade you? How do does your nation get defended?


And who's fault  is that? And who's going to provide more tax cuts to corporations even though they pay virtually nothing? There should be a law, IMO, that says if you make revenue in America or and American company, you pay 25% tax. No matter what. You can claim all the bullshit loop loopholes you want but at the end of the tax return there should be a line item that adds up all of your income/revenue. And another line item that says, calculates 25% of that revenue. And that's your tax bill. 
Oh you made $100b this year from sales? You tax bill is $25b. Simple as fuck. I'm personally okay with making corporation pay even 80% tax. I don't give about the well being or the profit margin of a corporation. Nor should you. Companies should only exists if we let them through out demand of their service.

Did you type in the seed word exactly, in order? Some wallet will ask you to type in the seed in random order. They might ask type in 7th word first, then 19th word, then 5th word, etc. And then did you type in the passphrase exactly considering all the uppercase, lowercase, etc. Also did you make sure you didn't put a space after the passphrase. Sometimes when I type fast, I end up with a space after my passphrase. That would cause you to not get your wallet. 
Also sometimes you have to make sure hardware wallet and whatever you are restoring to is using the same BIPS version.

Blockchain is also generally on public. So transparency is one such benefit of block chain and if applied to government, it would be a good thing. The one example that comes to my mind is tax money. Lets say all tax collected by certain government is on a public block-chain. You can track your tax money all the way down to the last guy.  That would be  good thing. It would seriously cut down on corruption.

I wouldn't chose the 25th word from any BIP word lists. I believe the only requirement on the 25th word less than or equal to 50 characters. You chose any alpha-numeric value here. You can go all out and make it a totally random password like string. Or you can use something familiar like your mother's maiden name (don't actually use your mother's maiden name. Just providing an example)
Pick something you can easily remember. You can pick the word apple for one wallet, you can use orange for next, cherry for 3rd one, grape for the 4th one and so forth. (Can't reiterate this enough. If you read about it online--just jut have here--then don't use it.)

Yeah. I have had this feeling also. Bitcoin needs to be a currency that you use to transact. And it needs to be a a store of value. Right now transacting with bitcoin is kind of impossible. This is fine for now because transacting with bitcoin is a very, very, very small fraction on all the transaction in the world. But if bitcoin is to remain relevant and become a currency, it must have be able to transact. For that we need 100% segwit adoption, bigger blocks, and secondary layer solution. Segwit will immediately add 2x more transaction in each block. So those 230K unconfirmed transaction would be confirmed within  29 blocks (assuming no new trans happened) instead of taking 77 blocks. And then if the blocks are twice as big, it would confirm within 14 blocks. And if all small transaction done in secondary layers, maybe all the 230k transaction might have been confirmed within 5 blocks. We really need to start the process of segwit adoption, blocksize increase, and secondary layer solution. 
This subreddit needs little less of hodl meme and a bit more of technical discussion for making bitcoin great again.  if you will. Yesterday I did several LN transaction on testnet. It was freaking awesome. I'm excited about that. I'm using segwit wallets. But coinbase/gdax doesn't. I just don't understand how they could ask for segwit2x when they can't even implement segwit yet. I  also don't understand how they could add bcash and not implement segwit.

Yeah. Bitcoin's high fee are standing in the way. Most remittance (the one's I've witnessed myself at Walmart) are under couple hundred dollars. And the fee is usually only $10 and it takes about 10 minutes to arrive at the destination. Bitcoin can't compete now because of high fee and longer confirmation time. Altcoin can be used. But alt coin aren't accepted in countries like Uganda as much. I wonder how LN will resolve this, considering LN requires two on chain transactions to open and close. 
I've said this before and I'll say it again. We need 100% segwit adoption, we need bigger blocks, we need LN. Let's not limit ourselves to just one solution that won't work for all use cases.

Storage of blockchain isn't the issue. As you said storage is cheap. It's the bandwith needed to propagate bigger blocks throughout the whole network of nodes. Right now each block is about 1mb. Assume there are 10000 nodes. Each of those nodes need to download that new 1mb block. If they were doing it from a central location, thats 10000mb  or 10gb of data every 10 minutes. Still not that daunting. 
Bitcoin needs bigger blocks. LN and other segwit etc are nice. But nothing will come close to solving the problem as would bigger blocks. Hopefully thread like these are going to cause us all to finally agree for bigger blocks. I say we move directly to 16mb block. Segwit would make that 32mb. That should allow us to transact for few years to a decade.

Let's see explain why I said thief. Roger Ver created a bcash wallet but he makes it seem like its a bitcoin wallet. People put bitcoin in it thinking it's bitcoin. But they send bitcoin to bcash address. These people lose money. And Roger Ver is sitting in some dungeon in Japan collecting those same bitcoin and moving them to his personal stash. That's why this is theft and that's why I said theif.
And why did I say sock puppet. You and many other users who post on come from r/btc. You have very short post history. You come here trying to co-opt bitcoin's name and trying to sabotage bitcoin. Why? Because you must be paid to do this. You literally work to make millions of people around the world lose money. Why would you do this if not for your personal benefit which comes in the way of payment for sock-puppetry for CEO of  Bcash.
Roger Ver pumping and dumping bcash isn't a conspiracy. It's reality. He said so on national tv and he said so in an interview online. He said bcash is his project. He said he's going to fraudulently promote bcash as bitcoin. I'm not a loser for seeing your Lord-God's ponzi scheme. 
Bitcoin does need to scale and one of those method for scaling is blocksize increase. I hope someday this will happen. If we don't scale bitcoin with both on chain scaling and off chain scaling, bitcoin will eventually fail or become irrelevant. I'm not an engineer on bitcoin or a famous bitcoin personality. Had I been, I'd be working on that. But I'm a user of bitcoin and I'll continue to promote scaling with community consensus. 95% consensus.

Simple. Buy one bitcoin and hold for 1 years. While it's not 100% certain that BTC will go to $100,000, I'm fairly certain that it will. 
I could also invest this $20000 in good growth mutual fund. My personal rate of return this year has been 25%. Since I started, I've average about 12% years. Even considering the terrible years around 2008. At 10% yearly return, I could have $100,000 in 18 years. 
Or I could have taken bigger risk. A few days ago FTR (stock) was about $6 and toward its 52 week low price. I could have bought 3075 shares of FTR. Now FTR is $10 a pop. I would have $30K now. Plus about another 6% in dividend coming right up in few days. FTR price will go up. I'd have to wait a few years. It would be $100000 for 3075 shares.
Obviously I don't have that much extra money. But I do have extra 500. That's almost double from FTR stock. 
There's so many ways to turn $20K into $100k. You just need time, patience, and disciple.

I don't know if you are trolling or if you are genuinely ignorant. The S2X hard for did happen. And it stopped working after two blocks. So no, it wasn't well tested. 


Now you are talking about SegWit adoption. SegWit fork was soft-fork. That's working well. Coinbase and Bitpay need to adopt it. This reduce  network fee and confirmation time. 


Now you are talking about the exchanges and the fee you pay for using them. They can continue to charge that amount or more. 


Larger blocks now would and does lead to centralization. Larger block few years down the line does not. Because bandwidth usually increase year over year and price usually goes down.

Coinbase has millions of customers and it's signing up thousands of new customer everyday. They have shitty  customer support, which means they have very few customer support personals. So if a very few customer support are responsible for verifying your ID, then you are going to wait a long time.

I understand that for the individual this is possibly the the best out come. But scroll a bit on  and you will find many pots, many posts about people complaining about these exchanges giving people run around. They only come out to help the person when they post on Reddit. We are seeing more and more of this. You need your case to go viral before you are helped. That's fine for someone who's post goes viral and who gets help. But what about my friend or your mom who doesn't know about reddit or twitter. Or knows about it but has very little followers. How is he or your mom gonna get support when invariably they require it on some issue. 
Kracken, Cex, Coinbase and every other company should provide reasonable and transparent customer support to all customers regardless of their status on social media. You, me, or anyone should be able to call or email Kraken and get resolution. Don't let these companies get away by providing them with excuse. I'm not looking out for myself.

Wall Street and traditional bankers/investors hate bitcoin and crypto-currency. What they will do is bet against bitcoin. And this will causes average mom-'n'-pop type bitcoin owners take notice and start to sell off their actual bitcoin holding. And they will be catalyst for more actual bitcoin holders to sell of. Rather than the futures market following bitcoin, bitcoin will start following the futures market. And this will generally push price down or make it stagnate. We were hoping to reach $100k/btc by years end of 2018. That's not going to happen. I feel like if we can get to even $25K by the years end and sustain that, we'll consider ourselves lucky. 
Of course this is my gut feeling based on what I see and feel. Generally throughout my life my gut feeling has served me well. I'm going to continue to listen to my intuition and not invest a single more penny on bitcoin. 
Also I'm not saying this just now. If you go through my post history, I've made similar posts weeks and weeks and months ago. We had meteoric rise and now with the futures market in play we hardly get much rise and if you look at the price now on gdax, it's generally under pressure to go down. 
That said, I'm still gonna hodl my position. I'm in it for idealism and not really get rich quick scheme. My plan was to hodl until next reduction on block reward (2020) and I'm gonna keep hodling until then.

Most worthwhile cryptos have their difficulty set so high (naturally) that home mining doesn't make sense. You would have to mine for months and maybe more than 1 years to just break even. And difficulty of mining gets adjusted, usually adjusted up. That almost adds exponential time to break even. It's not worth it. Unless you can make the initial big investment and your power costs is next to nothing. I'm talking about less than 5 US cents per watt. 
For me, it was better buying said crypto and just riding along with the value appreciation. 
3 months ago, for me to mine bitcoin as part of a pool, in a meaningful way I would have to invest $5000. Plus ongoing power costs. I could have bought 1 bitcoin for $5000. And today I'd have almost $15000 more. 
That said you still turn a profit if you are patient. I'd think a mining rig with careful planning would give you best bang for your buck.

We need to hurriedly talk about block-size increase. LN ain't coming soon enough. And even with LN, it won't solve the on-chain scaling issue. 
There's two choice now: Do nothing, and watch bitcoin dwindle in value and go down and settle somewhere much lower than where it is now. Bcash goes up but it doesn't go up to current bitcoin value and definitely not much higher than where bitcoin is now.
Or increase blocksize, get LN out faster, and watch bitcoin go to moon. All the new people who came to bitcoin and watched the price increase are learning about confirmation time and transaction fee. If both of these things were reasonable then it would be fine. But the confirmation time and transaction fee on bitcoin isn't reasonable anymore. I feel like.

Let's forget the notion that 100% of all transaction would ever be done using one currency or one crypto-currency. Even staunch crypto supporters like us do 99% or more of our transactions with fiat or credit. So no, we won't need gigabytes size blocks anytime soon. Someday we might need it and during that time gigabytes will be how megabytes are to us today. I feel like having a 16mb block now with segwit (which makes is 32mb) would tides us for few years. Add snorr (?sp) signature, etc and we'd be okay for 5 years or more. Add LN also. Now we good for a decades. 
I'm not bcash shill. I love my bitcoin decentralized. But let's be honest 2mb vs. 16mb doesn't really centralize much. I was sick last few days. What I don't want is for bitcoin to be complacent and eventually become irrelevant.

Let's say you have your wallet with 24 word plus your 25th word as "one". When you connect your device, you type in your passphrase "one" and everything is there. But what happens you type in "two" as your passphrase. You still get a fully functioning wallet. Except this wallet doesn't have anything in it. 
You can type anything as your 25th word. You will get a wallet. Say you type in "one", and on this wallet you put in $50 bucks. Then you type in "two" as passphrase, you put $50000 on it or any amount. Type in "three" and you can put any amount on that also. You can do this again and again.
Here's another way. Say your family has a family hardware wallet. You create your normal 24 seed words and add a passphrase. Your dad connects  it and types in "dad". He's gonna get a wallet. He's gonna use that. Your mom comes along and types in "mom". She gets are wallet. You come in an type "son", you get your wallet. All 3 people are using the same hardware wallet. They have the same 24 word seeds. But only thing different is there 25th word/passphrase. 
Hope this analogy explains it a bit better. Feel free to ask again. I'm not the most eloquent of writer.

Yeah. But at your own risk. Say you didn't write down you seed word correct. Now you try to restore the one device that you have working. If you mess up, you can seriously mess up.

I understand. While you cannot unlock a block before 10 minutes, you can however take 10+N minutes to unlock your block. If all hash power moves away, then no block will be unlocked ever. If on kilo -hash comes back, they can't possibly unlock a block in 10 minutes. They might take hours, may days. Maybe longer defending on difficulty. Blocks not getting unlocked in 10 minutes can be helped with a million desktop size computers hashing together. 
Block  has nonce of 3758312387. Whoever unlocked it, probably started from nonce  = 1 and iterated until 3758312387 until it worked. If they had 1 million computer working on it, they could have told each computer to hash with nonce x+1000. 
I start from 1 - 1000. You start from 1001 - 2000, that guy starts from 2001-3000. Etc. 
I don't know. I'm trying to think of things to help the network.

I'm okay with people calling the localized bubbles that we withness almost every week. But to the naysayers, when they say bubble usually, atleast it seems to me that, bitcoin being worth anything is a bubble. They cannot comprehend why bitcoin, money, gold (as store of value) have value/worth. We give it value. We make it worth it. Some tribe in some juggle has fashioned round stone balls. To us they are round stone balls. But they are being used by the tribe as money. And it works for them because they gave it value. Same way bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a stock. That's what a lot of people don't get. Bitcoin doesn't have quarterly earning reports.   It doesn't have board of directors. I know I'm preaching to the pulpit but from my personal experiences a lot of people are thnking of btc as stock. Some even worse...a get rich quicky ponzi scheme.

Do you even understand what is net neutrality. You seem to not understand it or seem to think it exists because of *benevolent* corporations. Net neutrality exits only because companies are forced to be neutral. Remove the regulatoin and companies will always, always, always, always do the thing that makes them the most profit. And charging people more always gives them more profit. You might say then customers can move the fuck on to another ISP. They can't. there's only 1 ISP in vast majority of areas. And even if there are a few choice, those "choices" actively collude on price or indirectly collude on price. 
You are not a corporation. You are a a citizen. You are actively working and supporting things that are against you and good of you. People like you are the reason why we cannot have nice things.

This is so stupid. Just mere days ago I was hodler. I'll probably hodl .2 btc still. But I'm gonna draw down my interest otherwise. Bitcoin/crypto are way too fucking stressful You gotta protect against forks, gonna keep your shit update, pay fee, way for confirmation, etc, etc. At least with USD, I don't have to worry about fork. Don't have to worry about someone creating a copy and sucking all the values out of it.

There is only 1 choice and two or at most 4. And the cost of entry into ISP market is not in millions but in hundreds of billions of dollars. I don't like any of the ISP in my area. I sure as fuck want to start my own ISP. But I cannot. Because i don't have several dozens billion dollars in my sock drawer. In this situation, we need the government to make the ISP our bitch. And do as they are told. One of the thing these bitches are told to do is be net neutral. But looks like the bitch ISP were able to line the dough-boy's pocket and now he's gonna remove net neutrality. And people like you are the useful idiots who will give this a pass and continue support your overlords. Your overloads aren't just sucking us dry of our freedom and choices and privacy.

What's to stop you all from deciding to fork again tomorrow and take all the value to the new chain while I remain back and watch my investment dwindle to nothing. 
At least with USD I am certain that if  have $100, a year from now it will still be $100 USD minus the natural inflation. And USD will still be USD.

If price drops around $200 for BCH, I'll be gobbling up a few myself. BCH is better than BTC in some ways. And it certainly has value. Maybe not BTC level value but definitely few thousands dollars in the long-ish run. That's how I feel. And should it ever take ever BTC, I'll have an edge. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:36:40
It's 144K now. So it went down 13k in 2 hours. So that's about 6.2 per hour. If there's 1 block every 10 mins, then each block is confirming 1000 trans. So in about 24 hours, all of those 144K transactions should be confirmed. A shit tonne of those transactions are going to be people transferring to exchanges to change to bitcoin cash. In the short term, I feel like the price of btc will drop further. I pray that it drops to a level where I can snap up 1 whole btc. Oh what a happy day that would be. Meanwhile, I'll pick up a BCH also. Just in case BCH takes over (very unlikely). But I ain't putting all my eggs in one basket. 
That's my plan. And I'm sticking to it. And I'd hodling long term.

Someone said OP might have gotten a hold of someone's computer and found their Coinbase account credential. And they are trying to social engineer their way into the account.

There are 170k+ unconfirmed transaction. If your transaction is one of the earlier ones, yours might get confirmed  in four hours or a bit later. There's about 1000 trans in a block. And each block comes in every 10 minutes. If you transaction is the 170k-th, you'll probably have to wait another day and half. This isn't always like this. 
Just hang on tight your would be confirmed a bit later. If you bought in 2013, you are gonna get a big profit. 
Your friend didn't really lose value. Unless they sold. Just wait few days, weeks, or months and the value would be double of what it is now. Eventually it will go up. Month of Nov 2017 is gonna be super hectic for bitcoin. If you can sit through this without emotional turmoil, I suspect you will be rewarded for you patience.

Why should you be able to move USD from one exchange to another exchange without actually moving the physical fiat? Or the equivalent of the physical fiat currency but while making usage of traditional banks which are already set up to move big dough around?
If tether is supposed to be a bank between exchange (which seems like it is), then it should put its reserve in glass case and make it audible by anyone at any time. Isn't that the whole problem with Fort Knox gold. There's no way of knowing if there's actually any gold in Fort Knox or not. Because nobody can audit it. Even congresspersons cannot audit it. Seems like tether is Fort Knox of fiat in crypto.

The whole local/grassroots level argument is bullshit in many case. Coroapte interest can get a hold of local bitches just as much as it can get hold of national level bitches. Local places are more corruptible. Because there's not enough exposure. The fact that you are debating this with me is because this is happening to a federal level branch of government. If it was local, neither  you nor I would be aware of this situation. 
Localities aren't some magical things that can solve all problem. We need the federal government for certain things. Actually we need an international government for somethings. 


Well, you do something about this. 


I thought you said locality can't get corrupted and stuff. Haha, you just argued for me. And I know know about it becasue that's your locality. Had it happened nationally, we would've seen at least a few reddit post about it.

To add to that (if you control your private key), in essence you will have both of the cryptos. However, if the new crypto doesn't do replay protection, then when you spend one you are going to be spending both. After the fork, you'd want to unlike your cryptos. I hope I can give you a basic idea of how to do this here. 
Let say you have 5 Bitcoin now. And after the fork, you will still have your 5 bitcoin. But you will also have 5 new coin. Let's call the new coin Shitcoin ( Because that's what it is).
Both your 5 Bitcoin and 5 Shitcoin has same private key.  When you spend from your bitcoin or shitcoin thinking you are spending one, someone can take your transaction and play it on the other coin. Let say you want to sell your 5 shitcoin. You do. But your transaction can be played in the bitcoin and now your 5 bitcoin is gone. To unlink, here's what you do. 
After the fork, you go to a trusted source and you make dame sure you are getting either bitcoin or shitcoin. Let's say you know you can buy a small fraction of bitcoin. And you buy that and send that to your bitcoin. Now you have your 5 bitcoin and another .0001 bitcoin. So your total bitcoin is 5.0001. And your shitcoin is still 5. You send your 5.0001 bitcoin to another wallet that you control. Someone tries to reply that on shitcoin chain can't do it. Because shitcoin wallet has only 5 shitcoin. Not 5.0001 shitcoin. 
Obviously don't do any of this without doing more research. You can really fuck up your cryptos if you aren't sure. The best thing to do is don't do anything with your cryptos starting Nov 10th through December 10th. Do all manners of research during these times.

I think the most important thing right now for bitcoin is the attacks that's about to happen to it on Nov 16th 2017. And the possibility that China will cease and stop all the mining operations. If that happens, bitcoin will be handicapped for a long while. Also bitcoin is now being used or will soon be used in futures market. And that's gonna fuck up bitcoin. The way it supposed to work is the futures markets supposed to follow bitcoin. But what's gonna happen is bitcoin is gonna start following futures market. And future markets are gonna have big fish who are going to influence the price and they are gonna fund the various attacks/forks to manipulate the price. Mark my word. This is gonna happen.

I don't mind the software update. What is scary for me is the whole flippening thing. I bought bitcoin knowing I'm buying bitcoin and it's the best one ever and it's going to last. That's where the whole team was. But now I feel like they are all moving to BCH. If not that, something else. How do I keep up with all of this? How do I know BTC is gonna remain valuable and I'm not gonna wake up tomorrow and see everyone else is one something else. 
I'm not stressed about storage of my bitcoin. Say I store it in paper wallet. It's safe. But tomorrow a fork happens and I don't see it until a year down the road. Or fork happens right after I buy. Which happened with BCash. I bought btc after fork. So I didn't get any. Suppposed Bcash becomes bitcoin and value goes up to $100000. I'm fucked. 
I now have equal nominal amount of btc and bch. And I'm done with cryptos. No more buying or selling. At least for the nest 2 months. This is the only I can keep my sanity. Meanwhile, I'll save USD through index/mutual fund.

All those people who bought Bitcoin thinking they're going to get shitcoins also are going to take in their profit now and escape
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:49:07


That really depends on the person to person. I personally think BTC is going to go up a lot in the next 6 or so weeks remaining in the year. Mainly because institutional buyers are going to start buying bitcoin futures through Chicago Mercantile Exchanges (CME). That money isn't directly going into bitcoin. Remember they are going to be buying, holding, trading *futures* of bitcoin, not bitcoin. But the cumulative effect of that is going to drive up bitcoin's price for the short term. 
I caution again that this is my gut feeling. If you take cue from my gut feeling and end up losing money, don't hold me responsible. At the end of the day you gotta make your own decisions and be okay with your decisions. 
I also bought some Bitcoin Cash in addition to the ones I got for free when the fork happened. I bought so because I was fearful that perhaps maybe Bitcoin Cash would become the Bitcoin. And what is Bitcoin now would stagnate and drop like 75%. That didn't happen. but I bought BCH at a very cheap price. I'm not selling my BCH just yet. But if I do, I would be making quite a bit of profit. I don't believe in selling my precious cryptos. I'm in it for the long run. I might sell my BCH after 6 months from now on if it hasn't shown life and gone up at least 100% and remained there consistently for several weeks. 
I have few other shitcoins and tokens. For the most part, I those are up. I'll probably sell them soon-ish to buy a laptop and pay some medical bills.

Are you for real? Property owners are fucking greedy bitches. They care about short term profit. They will let energy company pollute as long as they make a profit. Pollution has been defined by scientists, medical professionals and environmentalists. We don't need no fucktard gun-totting land-owners deciding what's best of the planet and health of me and my family. 
I have no qualm about trifling on property owners when it's for the benefit of greater goods and for the planet. 


Yes. I don't want you to freely go and hire an assassin to kill me. I don't want you to go freely sale drugs. I don't want you to go freely do something that harms others. I'm okay with stepping on your rights. You don't have unlimited freedom. You live in society. People who live in society are expect to live by rules and regulations and laws and norms that are beneficial for society at large. There is no free market. Absolutely free market doesn't work. And doesn't exists. 


Yes. That's why we have loan sharking rules. That's why we have regulations that clearly in one page define what are the condition of using that visa card. 


Not me personally. But it's perfectly acceptable for me and you and society to decide what's predatory. That's 


No all pro regulations people are good. Some of them use regulations for their personal benefit or benefit of their industry. Those are shitheads. But the vast majority of the pro-regulations people are people who care about the environment, people, privacy, rights. They should absolutely think their view alone is the best and everyone should live by their rules and regulations. 
For example, one regulations is that you cannot dump motor oil on your yard. You are supposed to take it to the recycling center. This view is the best you. Everyone should live by that view. 
I fully understand that might infringe on your right to dump on your yard. But I don't care. My way or now way in certain things. We cannot be tolerant to the wrongs and the imbeciles and the deplorables. If that makes us intolerant, so be it.

Sometimes thinking about the future, especially seeing some of the terrible things going on now, is really taxing and tiring and dire.

Google has been trying to offer ISP in some areas. They have billions of dollars. They built part of the infrastructure. But they cannot go ahead. Because the monopolies in these areas are terrible. And there are some regulations that are preventing google from going ahead. So not all regulations are good. I'll give you that. These bad regulations are usually paid for by rich republicans to help out their rich buddies become more rich. Those regulations need to be struck down. 


I would love to sigh up for ISP that's not the big 3? But I have no choice. So I am not really providing a demand. The startup ISP can't come because there is no demand. It's like a chicken and egg situation. There is where we need big government to tell the big ISP to make room for small guy. And I'm fine with that sort of regulations.

34 digits? This isn't looking good, bro/sis. That's is probably you public address. Go here  and type in that address and it should tell you how many bitcoin you have (if any). Do this especially if the digits start with 1. 
Private Keys are 52 digits long and that's what you need to sweep/transfer/spend your bitcoin. Without that even if you find out how many bitcoin you have, you will only be able to see it. You or anybody else in the universe cannot spend you bitcoin. But since you write down the public key, maybe you wrote down the private key also. Maybe you put it somewhere else. Keep looking. On your computer do deep search for that 34 digit number. Maybe you saved the 52 digit number also along side. I hope you find it. :) Best of luck to you, friend.

Are you for real? You really think I am gonna suggest black or anyone need to commit more crime? You really spun a weird web of fantasy in you mind and you want me to conform to some fetish you might have. Sorry, I cannot do that. 


That's partly true. Minorities in any country get more unfairly prosecuted, arrested, etc. Beside I wasn't arguing that blacks don't commit crime. I was arguing that nobody commits crime and says they did so because they are certain ethnicity. As to while anyone commits crime, there are literally thousands of books written about about it. You should read a few of those. 
Your comment suggest you are fearful of minorities and scared of others. You should stop that. Get some friends who are not like you. If you're not gay, get a gay friends. If you aren't black, get some black friends. If you aren't Muslim, get some Muslim friends. If you aren't white, get some white friends. Expand your world. 
Stop with the casual racism. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:33:22
Why is this propaganda.? Statistically whites commit more crime than blacks in America. You know because whites make up vast majority of the population. Besides no criminal ever thinks to himself that "I'm white, I'm gonna go commit crime." Nor does  black criminal think, "I'm black so I'm gonna go commit crime." 
You are trying to make an issue out of nothing here. Blacks commit crime. Whites commit crime. Pink commits crime. Everyone ethnic and racial group commit crime. Get over yourself and your false sense of superiority. This is Not or @_date: 2017-10-24 20:52:59

But in doing so, you fit into my mold again. 
You are probably debating about not replying again. But that's gonna prove you are emotionally effected by this so much so that you have to actively force yourself to stop replying. 
It feels very frustrating, right?  When you are in a situation where you have no out. I sympathize with you. The thing to is never let social media like reddit effect you emotionally. 
It's okay. I let you off. You don't fit in my mold. You are a human beings with your own course of action. Just because I can predict what you are gonna do or not do, doesn't mean you are any less valuable. You have friends (I hope) and family. I'm certain people love you even if you are kind of a cunt online. Chances are that they don't know you are a troll online. You do a good job of compartmentalizing your online persona vs your offline self. Let me know if I need to say anything else to validate you or your existence. Don't let me effect you emotionally.

Anybody who has bitcoin prior to the fork will get the new shitcoin (i.e. B2X).  If you have your BTC on Coinbase, you are at the mercy of when you get your shitcoin (i.e. B2X). But if you have your BTC anywhere where you have access to the private key, you get your shitcoin (i.e  B2X) right away. 
You basically have to get a shitcoin wallet and sweep your BTC private key and get your shitcoin. I wouldn't do anything for few months. Right now shitcoin is worth $800 per shit coin. Maybe shitcoin might go up. Maybe not. Don't be in a hurry to spend or sell your shitcoin. 
Hold for a while and see how things shake down. Then you can decide what to do. 
I don't recommend keeping your cryptos in Coinbase. You don't have access to the private key. And if you want to move your currency to coinbase, don't forget you pay network fee every-time you transfer funds from one wallet to another. 
I'd also not buy from coinbase on or after the fork. Unless you are 100% certain of getting BTC or shitcoin.

Gold is extremely expensive. If other metal could do the job of all the jobs gold does, don't you think companies would move to those metals ASAP? They would. To cut costs. Since they continue to use gold for their wears and gears, we can be certain that other metal cannot do the job of gold or cannot do it as well as gold can. Gold is one of the most versatile metals. Maybe someday we can stop using gold for technology. But that day isn't now or even in these few decades. Even this century. I say century because quantum computers are coming and those need gold. Humanity will be using quantum computer for centuries before we can something find better, if at all.

The basis on which Jamie Damon called bitcoin/crypto-currrency a fraud isn't reliant upon the current price of bitcoin to USD. You should take the time to read what he said and why, then you won't make stupid retort like "Bicoin is now $6000. So he was wrong."
He called it a fraud on the basis that it has no government guarantee.  That's is factually true. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  It's valuable because people say its valuable. There's nobody to hold accountable. Like with fiat currency. You can go sue US government for your USD related grievances. You cannot for bitcoin. This is not a bad thing. Try to understand people as they would understand themselves or want others to understand themselves. That's a life lesson, I guess.

Most of these predictions are not simply numbers taken out of their arse. They do actually use historical data to support their basis. And nearly all of these predictive and future-looking article make it abundantly clear that future is uncertain and bitcoin price has many variables and new variables are coming into play every single day. 
We can all dismiss these predictions. But the cumulative effect of all these high predictions is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more people see these, they fear of missing out. And some even think bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme. They enter the bitcoin ecosystem. And as user grows, so does demand and demand increase the price of bitcoin.
