I don't know. That is un-usually. I don't have such experience.

I understand your Dissatisfaction. Their description is always insufficient. But that is BTC-e(^^). However, the answer from support became quite early than before. With that alone I am satisfied.
Their word "money hold" means that you can't withdraw money/btc.
It don't mean that can't buy btc. 
Even you deposit via non-SEPA (ex...perfectmoney, okpay, interkassa..... ) they will hold your money for 24 hours. 
But it was little amount (ex..50usd, 70usd), they don't hold. They don't explain about the threshold.
My situation,,, I sent money via international wire on last friday,
it arrived on my account of BTC-e on Tuesday and they "hold" it.
I sent ID and Utility bill on Wednesday.
Today (Thursday), they un-hold it.
No problem for me.

After having posted the first line, I revised it and posted a message including the second line.
"wire" was my mistake. You said SEPA.
Anyway, I want to know where did you send money, vice commers bank or deutsche bank?
And, BTC-e's deposit page explains that they need ID and utility bill.
36097mins is 25days, not 600+days.
I sent money to deutsche bank. Now "money hold 41701min", I sent my ID and utility bill and I waiting. Yes, same situation with you.
Did you send your company's ID and utility bill?

Again again, Australia!!
1 year ago, Nov.19 2012, Australian exchange "cryptoxchenge.com" escaped. 
They said they will refund to their customers till Dec.31 2012 via bank wire,
but they didn't. They stole my 5303.97usd. 
Also NSW Fair Trading ignored my complaint.
I don't trust business man of Australia, in financial transactions in particular.
