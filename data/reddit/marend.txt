Hi everyone, I'm Megan with the ChallengePost team. We powered the ideas competition on our platform, as well as the main apps challenge at  
I was not involved in the judging process, but can speak to the challenge rules, which are clear: public voting narrowed down the submissions to the top 25 ideas. From there, judges determined the top 10 ideas (the winners) based on three criteria:
* Quality of the Idea 
* Feasibility of implementation; and 
* Potential impact on MintChip offerings and electronic payment technology
The judges used those three criteria to pick the ten winners. The rules were followed to the letter:  
Additionally, only six of the 10 most-voted ideas ended up getting prizes. So it wasn't just the Bitcoin submission. There were three others that were in the top 10 most-voted and did not win a prize. 
Bitcoin is awesome. Nobody hates Bitcoin or the submission in question. But according to the judges, it just didn't make the cut in terms of top 10 ideas submitted. 
It would be great if someone could post this response on the Bitcoin forum, as I am a new user and can only post in the "newbies" forum:
