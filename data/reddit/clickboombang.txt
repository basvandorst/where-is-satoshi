We have my people working on finding you. You'll be caught. However, as a safeguard against a ddos, I can send you money once I get home and leave for our cold storage. I can give you 1000 now, the rest in about 8 hours. We will find you. I am destroying this email address as soon as I send this email so my staff doesn't know I sent it. Use  to tell me the new address you would like to send the money to. I will not send it to the one you publicly told me to send it to. Pick a new address and I can send the first thousand in less than 1 hour. If you don't want to use the form submission I have an alternate way to contact me listed should you require that.
We will find you. You won't get away with this. Now is your last chance to stop the threat against us.
waiting to be found
