The Chinese-language document, as seen by the South China Morning Post, was distributed as an internal document among banks, and not published on the central bank’s official website.  
  
**“Banks should enhance their daily transaction monitoring, and the timely shut down of the payment channel once they discover any suspected trading of cryptocurrencies,”** the document said, adding that the deadline for disclosing the measures is on January 20. The emphasis was on handling any capital settlement to avoid any financial losses by cryptocurrency investors from escalating into public protests - known as “group events” in China - and preserve social stability, the central bank said.

I suspect Bithumb of wash trading with next to zero fees. Bithumb is responsible for the vast amount of all pump and dump trading recently, including bcash, ether and ripple. Over the last few days during Ripple pump 40% of global volume was traded through this one Korean exchange. It is responsible for less than 2% of BTC global volume.  
  
Basically the exchange is used for market manipulation, but supposedly tighter regulations are around the corner, so lets see what happens with volume then.

How do you define centralisation ? When all the other large pools fuck off and one pool is left standing on its own, one that lets users choose how they vote, this kind of looks like all the other pools are centralised.  
  
Bitcoin.com mining pool offered free choice to mine on BCH and BTC, then when it came down to it Bitcoin.com told all the users with mining contracts their hash power would be pointed to support 2X and no choice. 1984 anyone ?

@_date: 2017-11-17 11:00:59
The 2X fuckwits withdrew from the NYA, but not before releasing the code into the wild. Over 7% of miners still signalling they are going to mine it and there's at least 139 btc1 nodes running - possibly more. Still could be a shit show as there's no proper replay protection in the code. Approximately 2 hours 20 mins before the possible fork at time of posting.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:52:23
I understand your analogy, but I honestly don't think it would have been a nuclear war. If they thought they had a reasonable chance of winning they would still be going ahead with the fork. Personally I believe it would have all been in over in a matter of a day or two, and we could put all this behind us once and for all. This is the fourth attempt to hijack Bitcoin from the same people and it won't be the last. The only way this stops is when they finally do fork and I sincerely hope they get well and truly rekt when they do.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:18:39
I really wouldn't recommend trying to time the market, just buy and hodl. Too many times you read about people selling expecting a dip, then having to buy back in at a higher price. They just end up with less bitcoin than they started with. Bitcoin has gone up 700% so far this year, that should be enough of a return to warrant risk free hodling.

The problem here is one single person. Garzik fucked up the code twice. John Newbury pointed out the second bug preventing miners even being able to mine a large block. What does Jeff do ? He posts a patch. Yes, he posts an untested or reviewed patch to a project that is dead.  
  
This is the shitty bit. All the major companies had withdrawn from 2X / NYA. As the code was buggy 2X couldn’t even fork, which was great, with no support and unable to fork 2X was completely dead and no threat to BTC. So Jeff fucking fixes it. The only reasons to do this are all malicious. The guy is a piece of shit.

This is not a tx fee. Bitpay is a shitstain if a company, they are a bunch of scammers and liers with a political agenda funded by Roger Ver, one of there investors. This is why bitcoin has a ‘network fee’ and bcash doesn’t, to push a false narrative. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:27:16
About 30% - 40% of bcash trading is through OKEx. If you combine OKEx and HitBTC, **just two exchanges**, on a normal day they account for 50% of all bcash volume. 
Conversely 50% of bitcoin volume is normally spread between 10+ exchanges.

Simply, with proper replay protection added to the 2X code, the fork will be similar to the BCH fork. You will get coins on both chains.
Without replay protection transactions are susceptible to replay attacks, spending both coins instead of just one.

How the fuck do you always lose ? All you have to do is buy it and then do nothing... 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:49:09
It will be a hard fork, but without replay protection there won't be a free airdrop. Without replay protection its just a fight to the death between miners / hash rate and developers / users. As the majority of hash rate will be on the 2X side it will take a long time for the difficulty adjustment to change and allow normal transactions on the main chain. Most of the nodes will be on the main chain and this will greatly affect block validation on the 2X side. This is a hostile takeover of bitcoin and it is going to be a mess.
That's if it happens. Just got to sit back and eat the popcorn. Exchanges and businesses don't like the lack of proper replay protection. I would imagine they are also very nervous about letting development of the coin that underpins their business move from 200 tested core developers to one guy, presumably paid by Bitmain, who is happy to rush out software on the network. 
You have to remember that none of the core developers were invited to New York or signed the NYA. Most of the companies that did sign were either owned or have dealings with DCG, or were miners associated with Bitmain - with some exceptions. November should be fun :D

Thank you for the explanation. So, reading Freicoin wiki, this would be an extra fee payable to miners to incentivize mining on the BTC chain ?

@_date: 2017-09-20 12:12:11
Well the only way to run a decentralised network is to let one man, Jihan Wu, control most of the mining hashrate, have a near monopoly on mining hardware and now control software development.
If only he had thought to buy into exchanges, wallets, payment processors and bitcoin news sites to properly decentralise everything once and for all. Oh, wait... he has.

There was no KYC, just scan your wallet QR code, stick cash in and press the big green 'buy' button. Fees were about 10%, which wasn't far off what tx fees were at the time.

Without proper replay protection I don't think there will be a free airdrop of coins. At least the BCH fork had replay protection. Without replay protection they will not create an altcoin, this fork is a hostile takeover attempt mainly by companies under the influence of DCG and Bitmain, and it's going to be very messy.

Because big blockers didn't want Segwit, they wanted big blocks - they have Cash. Small blockers wanted Segwit and 2nd layer transactions, they have this now in Bitcoin. 
The people who want both Segwit and big blocks... miners and DCG. The majority of miners are controlled by one person / company, Jihan Wu / Bitmain. DCG is a group of companies controlled by one guy, Barry Silbert. 
Many here think handing over control and development of a multi billion dollar entity like Bitcoin to two people completely breaks decentralisation - Bitcoins biggest strength. Jihan Wu and Barry Silbert's main aim is to take over control of Bitcoin development and road map from Core. Core has around 200 developers working on the protocol and other related projects. 2X has one developer whos main strength seems to be copying Core code into his own.
This is a hostile takeover, it isn't about getting Segwit and 2X, because as you say they could just fork Cash. These two want to takeover the golden goose, bitcoin.

I don't want 2X at all, but I really can't see Jihan / Bitmain pulling out now. The best hope is for exchanges and payment processors who signed the NYA to withdraw support - opt in replay protection is a joke. 
Coinbase should be ashamed of themselves, and not just for their shoddy customer service this time. They are still supporting 2X, even when a KYC survey on their own platform clearly indicates the complete lack of support from their users / clients.

I didn't say they aren't smart, but it's very unlikely they sell all the BTC they mine and take in fees over the counter for cash - the volume for Bitmain / Antpool alone is enormous.

I would buy btc and hodl, you will make far more doing this than mining. You are up against miners with virtually free electricity, with the latest and best asics probably running asicboost as well. If you are dead set on doing this then buy an asic and point it at a pool, something like slush pool, but you wont make anywhere as near as much compared to just buying the btc in the first place. If you want a hobby you can mine some alt coins with gpus.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:54:13
Miners are certainly going to have a hard time converting bitcoin into fiat with no exchanges. They need fiat to pay electric and staffing bills and will have to be very careful selling BTC abroad to bring fiat in, I don't think China will like that much. My guess is there's been one or two really urgent meetings in the Bitmain boardroom... and a few more to follow.
Exchanges may come back, but as things stand, most are shutting. Personally I will be glad to see the end of China drama.

There has been talk of a change in PoW as a threat to miners if they go ahead with 2X. Not sure how realistic this is. There has also been talk of a difficulty adjustment hardfork on the Core chain after 2X, again not sure how realistic this is either. 
November is going to be interesting :D

Miners are certainly going to have a hard time converting bitcoin into fiat with no exchanges. They need fiat to pay electric and staffing bills and will have to be very careful selling BTC abroad to bring fiat in, I don't think China will like that much. My guess is there's been one or two really urgent meetings in the Bitmain boardroom... and a few more to follow.
Exchanges may come back, but as things stand, most are shutting. Personally I will be glad to see the end of China drama.

I have so much respect for this guy. Although I don't agree with everything he says or does, I really admire his drive and ambition. There are very few people in the world like him who actually do everything they can to make their ideals and dreams a reality. 
He's also done an awful lot for bitcoin over the years and we should thank him for that alone.

It will be a standoff. 2X will mine most of the blocks, but wont have the nodes to validate properly. Core miners won't mine many blocks, but will have the vast majority of nodes. 
The way I see it is miners have to be making money all the time. Miners on 2X will have a hard time without the nodes, the small amount of miners on core will mine the same amount of blocks as normal and have no trouble validating. I expect the vast majority of hashrate will be with 2X initially, but will swap back to core as they have to pay for the mining rigs and electric. Bitmain can hold out for a fair while due it's wealth, but not all miners are so rich.

lol, that was my idea at the start of the year and all I was hoping for was BTC to go to $2k by Christmas, and this would get me a very nice car. Seeing as how its now at about $5750 I'm just going to hodl my BTC and buy a car with FIAT - I don't want or need a Lambo.

The 2X hardfork is not about a block increase, it's about miners 'sacking core' and taking over development.  
This is about Bitmain controlling mining, asic manufacture and protocol development, whilst also having interests in payment processing, wallets, exchanges and media. They want to completely control and centralise bitcoin for their own benefit.

Yeah, sorry, I googled 'Timo' and it ties up with Dr. Timo Schlaefer the CEO of the company. I assumed it was a non-entity from marketing, maybe wrongly. Press releases, or emails from press often get retracted - statements from the CEO or from a company platform are normally more concrete. I'd just like them to come out and say it to the world and not just to one person in an email.
I would rather Timo had emailed, updated company facebook, tweeted from his own account or blog posted on behalf of the company - a CEO switching to a 'press' email account is a bit weird.

I didn't say they aren't smart, but it's very unlikely they sell all the BTC they mine and take in fees over the counter for cash - the volume for Bitmain / Antpool alone is enormous. I also think it wouldnt go down well with PBOC if they operated out of another country - one of the main reasons the PBOC is regulating is to prevent Yuan leaving China.

Bcash needs to overtake Doge first.  
  
BCH transactions 24hr 16,595  
DOGE transactions 24hr 22,196  
  
BCH average block time 10m 59s  
DOGE average block time 1m 3s  
  
BCH average transaction fee $0.0303  
DOGE average transaction fee $0.0033  
  
DOGE has more utility. It has more transactions, faster transactions and cheaper transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:21:28
I hope they get their new difficulty algorithm in place sooner rather than later. I really don't want BCH to fail. BCH gives big blockers what they want - I don't want another BTC hardfork in 6 months.
My worry is miners couldn't give a shit about BCH, they are just going to keep exploiting the EDA and raping the blocks. If miners aren't going to agree to a MAHF I'm not sure how the new difficulty adjustment will be incorporated.

He's taken money to do a job, one which came with a lot more baggage than he expected - and I think he actually did believe he had been chosen by the privileged few in cryptospace to code the new consensus agreement.
  
He knows the shit he's doing doesn't fit well with his earlier beliefs, but at the same time he didn't expect his peers to turn on him like they did. He probably regrets what he's doing, unless the paycheck is enormous, but will do what he's paid for to the best of his abilities. 
I don't think he's a bad guy, but he can be bought and to him $$$ are more important than principals. He's burned a ton of bridges now, but from the amount of 'bring the old jeff back' posts you see, i think he still has standing and people just want 'Good Jeff' back, not 'Paycheck Jeff'.

Bitcoin is mining 2mb blocks due to Segwit. Bcash narrative is Segwit isn't a block size increase and yet blocks being mined now are twice the size.
Bcash has hardforked to 32mb blocks and yet most blocks are less than 50kb in size.  
  
Fun fact - in last 24 hours  
BTC transactions totalled $4,248,092,250

Bitcoin has a market cap of ~$100bn. Sooner or later there is going to be a ton of fakes on the market with non standard chipset or firmware. If I was looking to sell these on the market I would sell through ebay and the like.  
  
You cant trust packaging or certificates which can be easily faked and I'm not sure what you mean by something attached to it ?
