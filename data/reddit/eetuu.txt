Actual price movements are the clearest form of market sentiment.

This has nothing to do with bitcoin

With every dip there is less and less believers buying the dip. Some hardcore believers will keep buying no matter how low the price goes, but I believe it´s already too late to turn this death spiral around.

What fundamentals?

RSI is a useless metric. It just states the obvious about past price movements.

Yeah some people have made a fortune this year shorting cryptos. I had a huge short but got unlucky with timing and a little too greedy with 7X leverage and got rekt. That short would be worth hundreds of thousands today.

Isn´t it obvious why there is more interest during big price moves?

I think those are promises not fundamentals. A lot of ethereum development going on but fundamentals are shit like cryptokitties and MLB bobbleheads. A lot of projects which try to build a speculative bubble on top of  a speculative bubble.

 \-10% in one day isn´t a dent? LOL. Many hodlers have believed 6k was the  floor for bitcoin, because that´s what mining one costs. Never made any  sense why something should be expensive just because it´s expensive to  make and now when price is well under 6k it can plummet and go to death  spiral.
