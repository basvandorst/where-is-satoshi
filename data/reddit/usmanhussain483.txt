The reason it is going down is several reasons that it could be doing it, but the main reason is no real use of adoption and the hype dying down and the market is small enough to manipulate,  and you do know a huge majority of bitcoin is owned by whales and big traders meaning they have the keys to control the market, go look it up.

Go look up the news, Government is looking at regulation because of all this manipulation and fake orders going pumping the price then selling off making it decline, the market right now is small allowing manipulation to occur.

Keep dreaming, keep trying to defend your get rich quick Pontiac scheme, you cannot even buy a coffee with it without being charged high fees if it was going for real adoption. Bitcoin cash should take its place.

U mad IT beats blockchain technology 
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:11:34
Yes there is, it's decentralized and no one controls it. Beats blockchain

There is no investment, people like you thinking you will go to the moon, BITCOIN will only succeed if people use it as a currency, not make profit off of it like you

Called regulation and market manipulation, the small time traders thinking they gonna get big but are being manipulated by the big traders.

Dip in February was the fud, bad news around bitcoin, and prove me wrong, Most of the bitcoin is owned by whales and big traders who can easily do this as they wish.

BCASH IS FASTER AND LOWER FEES THAN BITCOIN
@_date: 2018-05-29 01:24:07
SIMPLE, USE BITCOIN CASH AS ITS FASTER LESS FEES.
@_date: 2018-05-30 00:08:03
BITCOIN IS SLOW AND HIGH IN FEES, IT WILL NOT BE ADOPTED BY MASS
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:59:17
Prove it, Bitcoin cannot handle high transactions and slower than bitcoin cash, aaaah did I hurt your feelings?
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:41:55
Most of these late comers are investing in shitcoins or coins that target small industry's, thinking they will get rich.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:54:54
Nope, bitcoin itself cannot handle transactions when on a load making it a issue for adoption, BITCOIN cash however can handle the load meaning lower fees if it was to be adopted and faster transactions, BITCOIN rein is over, it's not the coin that will be used for adoption, THAT time is over, stop dreaming about buying a house by investing in bitcoin, your the same as those kids who bought bitcoin at 20k saying oooh I'm gonna get rich.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:41:12

@_date: 2018-06-10 21:02:52

Too many kids on here thinking their pocket money gonna make the rich, Bitcoin will be replaced
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:42:16
STOP LYING BITCOIN FEES GET HIGH WHEN BUSY, THAT IS A FACT, I USED IT, and if it gets adopted fees will be sky-high and it's speeds are slow compared to BCASH or any other ico that have 4seconds transaction speed.
Decentralization isn't good since the drug dealers, criminals and hackers etc. And centralized coins have a bigger chance for adoption.
