I don't know much about the ones you listed, but I know bitcoin.tax wouldn't work for me since I have a lot of transactions on gatehub. I wrote a script to parse the transactions I've been keeping track of in an spreadsheet. It will keep track of coins and their first value even as they get transferred and exchanged for alts.

Need more info, but you could just run it yourself.

This is the first one that actually made me lol

I've never actually filled out KYC info for any ICO since as soon as I see that, I usually deem it not worth the risk.

Not if you send from an exchange wallet ��

Lol. I got one last week also and they wanted $8800. It promptly went into the trash. For fun I did check the address, which had no transactions on the one they sent me.
Was yours post marked from Tennessee, too?

Typically, HTML forms will have a unique "token" (which isn't related to crypto) which will expire based on time or another of the same form existing in another window. That is likely the error message you received.

It will even grab historical crypto/Fiat values when doing calculations for coin to coin exchanges. 
Uses FIFO logic when using crypto.

If you just write down the 2fa key and stick it in your safe, that works too.
Or have a second phone or tablet and register them with the same 2fa key, that works, too.
Or if you have 1password, you can enter the 2fa key as a "one time" password and retrieve it from any device.
Personally, I do  and

Not to mention each contract is 5 Bitcoins, which will rule out smaller players.

It looks like you did what you are intending to do. 
You placed limit orders. Stop loss orders help limit loss. Given your example values about, you could put a stop loss order at $8900 which would SELL the amount specified. You could also put in a stop loss order at $9992 that would BUY the amount specified. 
The stop loss at $8900 would be placed so you can retain your profits (assuming you bought below $8900) in the case of the market dropping.
The stop loss at $9992 would be placed so you can make sure you don't "miss the bus" if the market rises sharply.

Assume market is at $9500.
A stop loss order at $8900 would **SELL** the amount specified.
 
A stop loss order at $9992 would **BUY** the amount specified.
A limit order to **BUY** at $8900 would **BUY** the amount specified. 
A limit order to **SELL** at $9992 would **SELL** the amount specified.
A limit order to **SELL** at $8900 would **SELL** at ~$9500.
A limit order to **BUY** at $9992 would **BUY** at ~$9500.

Doh. You're right. I forgot they said they were going to settle in cash. They probably couldn't procure proper channels to settle in actual Bitcoin...or maybe didn't want to commit that much to something unregulated. 
It would be cool, and would further Bitcoin adoption if they actually required to settle in Bitcoin...

Oh, I'm aware. ��
By smaller players, I mean most of the current "day traders" on crypto exchanges won't be messing around on the CME.

No, Neo. I’m trying to tell you that when you’re ready, you won’t have to.

Here's a top tip- use GDAX. Go to GDAX and click deposit in the tradeview and use your Coinbase account as the source. Place resting orders to avoid fees. Transfers out of GDAX are free as well.

You don't own your wallet on exchanges- the exchange does. You only own a right to a specific amount in that wallet. The exchange already has the amount you bought on their private ledger, so there is no "transaction time."
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:50:02
Absolutely no issues with using a Ledger Nano S, personally.
Actually, it's more likely you can take advantage of forks by using a hardware wallet since you own the keys.

The way futures works is you are speculating on a valuation for *something* (in this case BTC) at a particular point in the *future*. So when trading one of these upcoming bitcoin futures contracts, it will be something like BTCH8 (BTC = bitcoin, 'H' = March, 8 = 2018). 
Say the market for BTCH8 is $7500. 
1) If you think the price of a Bitcoin will be less than $7500 at the date of settlement in March 2018, you will want to SELL BTCH8. If the price of the contract starts to fall and is down around $7000, you may decide that your profits (selling at 7500 and buying at 7000, but note depending on tick size, and the quantity you bought, this may not be $500 of profit) are good enough and you then BUY the same quantity you SOLD at 7500. You would then be considered "flat" or have no position. You then walk away with your profits and nothing else. 
2) If you think the price of a Bitcoin will be more than $7500 at the date of settlement in March 2018, you will want to BUY BTCH8. If the price of the contract starts to increase and is up around $8000, you may decide that your profits (buying at 7500 and selling at 8000, but note depending on tick size, and the quantity you bought, this may not be $500 of profit) are good enough and you then SELL the same quantity you BOUGHT at 7500. You would then be considered "flat" or have no position. You then walk away with your profits and nothing else. 
3) If, however, you SELL at 7500 and never BUY the same quantity, at the date of settlement (sometime in March 2018), you will be required to produce the amount of Bitcoin you SOLD to transfer over to your counterparty(ies). Depending on the the price of BTC in March 2018, this could be good or bad. 
4) If, however, you BUY at 7500 and never SELL the same quantity, at the date of settlement (sometime in March 2018), you will be given the amount of Bitcoin you BOUGHT...transferred to you by your counterparty(ies). Depending on the the price of BTC in March 2018, this could be good or bad. 
The amount of money required to trade futures contracts is fairly high, because these are margin accounts (which take into account being able to sell before buying).

How do YouTube administrators avoid going to prison when they stumble upon some CP uploaded by a user? It's on their computer now.
What does the EU think about a link to a page that links to CP?
What happens if the random bits stored in your computers RAM could compose a complete CP image?
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:57:26
Yes, also humans. Your previous post failed to mention that aspect.

How about exchanges you don't consider "major?" A sizable portion of my trades were done on GateHub, which isn't a supported exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:23:10
Gatehub, for all it's limitations, does something like this.

This is somewhat akin to playing a Disney movie for your kids where the artists hid inappropriate objects in the scenery. 
Valid talking point, definitely, but mostly FUD. 
Say some ad content provider got hacked and inserted a child abuse image instead of a valid ad. You visit a legit site with this bogus ad and your browser caches the image. Are you at risk for being in trouble? Possibly, but I would say it's unlikely. 
The blame should be solely on whoever added an inappropriate transaction onto the blockchain.

It depends if you "own" the incoming/outgoing wallet. If you do not own the incoming/outgoing wallet, that is the basis for your value. 
I put own in double quotes because you don't technically own your wallet on exchanges, but the thought is the same. 
Ie- if you transfer BTC from Coinbase/GDAX to Bitstamp, you do not have to worry about any tax implication. 
However, if someone sends you BTC into your Coinbase account, you will have to calculate the fiat value at the time it hits your account. 
Similarly, if you purchase something using BTC, you will have to calculate the fiat value at the time the BTC leaves your account. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:42:03
Correct. The Coinbase reporting tool is only good if the only exchange you use is Coinbase/GDAX, as they do not know the status of the wallet on the other end, so they just assume the cost should be converted. 
I checked it out and decided it was worthless in my case, so I wrote a script to do all the calculations for me. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:55:30
This is only for fiat holdings, correct? BTC (or your CC of choice) "held" on a foreign exchange isn't "held" overseas. The private keys (to own the balance) are the calculation of a mathematical equation (ie are location-less), and the balance itself is written on a global blockchain.

If I was a billionaire, I wouldn't need crypto either.
