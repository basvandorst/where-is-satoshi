I saw your other comment and wanted to reply:
Ok I don’t actually think I misunderstood anything
1) it’s not nice when people rub bad days in your face 
2) it’s really annoying when crypto people deny its a bubble but won’t ever explain what value there is, so it’s really nice when justice is served
3) op is snarky, obnoxious and a total asshole. This is what I was commenting on and it’s not connected to 1 or 2

Keep it up with the “I think I’m Jim from the office” “I read this joke on reddit and now I’m pretending it’s my own original humor” replies. Really dazzling me here.
