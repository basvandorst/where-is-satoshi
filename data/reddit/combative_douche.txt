Good one.

I don't have to prove anything to be of the opinion that death threats are not okay.
**Leah:** I've received death threats.
**Poor Leah, being held accountable for her actions.
**Me:** Death threats are holding people accountable?
But if you really want proof, just look at her twitter mentions.

I don't have a position other than an anti-death-threat one. I'm unsure where I gave the impression of another position. Perhaps you could direct me to where I was unclear.

No... You said "A homeless". It's really dehumanizing and crappy.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:08:49
...and that's why they're okay.
Sure buddy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:58:47
What do I call people who are homeless? Uhh.. homeless people? I'm not sure what you're getting at.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:01:14
Yes, and that's why I asked him to clarify.

Your mistake is assuming roman numerals. Why you would do that, I have no idea.

Using adjectives as nouns when referring to a person, is generally a bad idea.

I don't see what that has to do with my comment. I'm not accusing anyone or saying the cops shouldn't handle anything...
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:52:44
The person I responded to wasn't questioning the death threats. They were saying she's getting what she deserves. The implication being that she deserves death threats.
And that attitude is exactly why I'd be surprised if she *wasn't* getting death threats.

So you're saying bitcoin has no validity as a currency? I mean, nobody in their right mind would consider penny stocks "a currency". Isn't the entire point of bitcoin that it's a currency? Seems like it's been a failure from day 1 then.

Once one attack is successfully defended against, try another. Then, immediately go ad hominem to boost your second attempt's effects.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:54:40
[Seems like it hasn't been cheap for reddit to accept bitcoin.](
Oh, and when you want real money, [it's so easy!]( Just deal with ridiculous waiting periods, huge fees, scammers, criminals, etc. And after all that, if you ever actually do get real money, you're losing like a third or more in the deal.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:08:08
Dude, we tip in the US. Deal with it. Sorry you have so much trouble dealing with a cultural difference, but if something like tipping is so confounding to you, you probably shouldn't leave your home.

That doesn't mean it's not accurate. Only that the people featured in the article didn't realize that Mt. Gox (you know, the most well known bitcoin *anything*) was only one of many different exchanges, some good, some absolutely horrible. That's more of a flaw of the bitcoin community than it is of the article. We can assume that Quiznos guy doesn't know which exchanges are shit and which ones are okay. Though yeah, I guess OP is helping him with that stuff.


This post was about a small business wanting to accept bitcoins. I felt that OP was doing bitcoin and Quiznos guy a disservice by misrepresenting bitcoin as good for his small business.


Eh, maybe a bit of publicity, but not really... I mean, this is a Quiznos we're talking about here.


OP sells Quiznos guy on it because he's a super enthusiastic bitcoiner. When Quiznos guy realizes it causes him to lose money and makes accounting a nightmare, he's going to stop using it and discourage anyone he knows from accepting it at their businesses.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:19:45
Most don't.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:00:23
That's like saying "I've been knocked out 3 times by getting hit in the head with a paint can, and I'm not addicted to huffing paint. Therefore huffing paint is not addictive."
Heck, I've been given vicodin half a dozen times for various injuries/surgeries, and I'm not addicted to vicodin. Doesn't mean vicodin isn't addictive. In fact, it's basically as addictive as heroin if taken in large doses.
I don't think you understand how addiction works. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:30:08
Yeah, it's crazy to think people should pay their taxes. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:42:55
But isn't bitcoin supposed to be easy to use?
And you still didn't address reddit's bitcoin accounting fees. 
I am failing to see an advantages for a small business owner, especially b&amp;m, of accepting bitcoins. Especially if they're not already obsessed with them and just like the idea and are willing to lose money on it to support the concept.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:12:59
The only consequences to not tipping are social.

"Almost no fees"
Unless you want real money.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:30:31


So... we agree. What this whole thing was about.


Sure, I suppose. But that doesn't have much to do with a Quiznos franchise owner.


"When" might be a bit more optimistic than realistic, but it's definitely possible. But yes, we agree then: This is not a good business decision for the Quiznos guy. So enthusiastic OP is probably damaging bitcoin more than he is helping it by misrepresenting it as a great business choice for the Quiznos guy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:50:42
So you'd be fine with people crossposting completely unrelated content from or Those posts shouldn't be deleted?
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:38:18
Currently, the only reason a small business b&amp;m owner would accept bitcoin would be if they personally are wanting supporting it and have a personal interest in it. Well, maybe tax reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:30:43
Exactly. Glad we're in agreement.
