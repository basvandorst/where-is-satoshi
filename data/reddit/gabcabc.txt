This guy has no idea what he's talking about. My favorite is this:


No. Because of that evil buzzword "regulation," banks are no longer allowed to automatically opt-in customers to overdraft protection. If a bank has signed you up for overdraft protection without your specific consent, they are breaking the law and you can sue the shit out of them.
Don't let reality stand in the way of your dumb rant, though...

I'm calling bullshit on this. To build a site with all the features you're suggesting would require tons of money and a large development team, and the site would still be stretched so thin that most, if not all, of those features' implementation would be half-assed. 
The site that you've built so far doesn't instill any confidence either. It looks like Geocities-era crap, right down to the ugly serifed font. It could be duplicated easily by a five-year-old. All competent web sites are built by focusing on one thing first and when that's perfected, moving on to the next feature. If you somehow do manage to build this thing (highly unlikely), it's bound to have security holes out the wazoo and I'll eat popcorn watching script kiddies go to town on it.
I suspect you already know all of this, however, and that this is some kind of scam/phishing attempt.
