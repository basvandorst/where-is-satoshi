It's $2.30 over spot per ounce when purchased bulk. COMEX Silver closed 18.80, so it's $21.10/oz for Schiff's (overpriced) coins.

* Bitcoin is the technological development in money that combines the best features of gold, cash, and digital payments.
* Bitcoin can be sent with a click or a tap globally, like an internet credit card payment
* Bitcoin payments are instant and permanent, like a cash transaction
* Bitcoin's value doesn't derive from a central authority, instead its value is based on the aggregate of everyone's valuation, like how gold has value.
* Unlike these traditional forms of money, however, Bitcoin is secured by advanced encryption, which can allow for more secure and private transactions than traditional digital payments, as well as advanced transactions that are not possible with legacy payment methods.
I like to focus on the "perfect money" side of the bitcoin technology, and how it is an advancement in the field of digital payments.

I know of someone who had stored his key in seven places--hidden in a diary, embedded in a ring, stashed in a locket, and went all the way with hiding parts in a chalice and crown.
You thought that this would be secure enough, but things didn't work out so well for him in the end.
If you ask me, it was because he entrusted his friend Harry with the last part.

Are Bitcoin processing companies just more knee-jerky with AML/KYC compliance than this multimillion-dollar backed company? It seems that Venmo is taking the Uber/tech startup playbook of: disregarding current regulation by calling it "innovation" or "disruption", invading user's privacy, and providing really awful customer protections and support.

Well yes, but implementing Bitcoin on an existing platform is much easier than designing and maintaining custom firmware for multiple devices + starting an entire network from scratch.
What Ryan should do is pitch Bitcoin integration (lower fees, easier to use around the world) to FON and do the engineering for them while marketing FON to Bitcoin users.

I've bought and sold items I have lying around for bitcoins instead of eBaying them--Bitmit's 1% is a massive amount better than the 10-13% I'm paying for on Ebay/Paypal.
As mentioned below, it's really hard to get buyers to part with their bitcoins. When I sell, I usually take a portion and liquidate immediately to hedge exchange rate risk, but I usually end up spending money in trading accounts back to bitcoins for purchases though. I am a strong believer that sellers should buy stuff with their bitcoins, and buyers of bitcoins should first try offering and listing stuff they have lying around before shelling out 4% in transaction fees.

It's a joke that we're so dependent on central banks and their IOUs and we trust them for the stability of our fiat currency. Much how a "run on the bank" would cause more and more panic, a banker running away with the government's gold holdings would be a sure signal to others of the lack of faith in the system, i.e. everyone's Dollars/Euros/Rupees would be worthless.
I see this as funny because of the number of prepper-Libertarian types on here who are always characterizing a powder-keg event not unlike what is described in the comic.
Random fun fact: you are actually limited to 70 pounds in a Small Flat-Rate USPS box. If it was filled entirely with gold, you'd still be able to ship it. Now, depleted uranium, now you're going over the weight limit.

I don't want to be wealthy if it's built on a bubble of unsophisticated "investors". Long-term success of a revolutionary technology like Bitcoin requires users to be aware of everything the technology implies. There are so many insecurities with the internet ecosystem right now, and all it does is lead to abuse &amp; exploitation by those who understand the technology better.

Just yesterday, I deleted SC from my bookmarks because I didn't use it, but then I realized that my reward points would be left at my old account, and there's the new rewards drawing every month (I guess that's my new favorite feature of the site). I was able to recover my old bookmark, however, so I'm able to get some more draws in for the monthly drawings.

I'm going to go ahead and say that if you can't calculate out fractions of a Bitcoin, you shouldn't be using it. Currency and equity shares are quoted as whole units. 
Ask someone how much USD/JPY is and they won't say that you can trade 1 penny for 1 yen. It's obvious that you can obtain fractions of currency, but it just doesn't make sense to quote fractions of currency.
EDIT: Also, adding mBTC will confuse people: "Wait, mBTC? I thought I wanted to buy BTC? Is mBTC the same as Bitcoin?", "How many mBTC is in a BTC? Wait, I don't want to only buy 1 thousandths of a bitcoin!", "Hey, I thought they said that there would be only 21 Million Bitcoins! How come someone is selling shares of one?"
Basically, if they can understand Bitcoin, they can understand fractions of a bitcoin and how they can be divisible. mBTC doesn't solve this problem of uninformed users.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:17:47
Yup, that sounds like a good system--do you think maybe some people prefer a more scheduled (wrt time of day/week) drawing, with the schedule being part of the ritual?
Also, maybe brand a lotto called DiffLotto or Lotto2016 that uses the last block before a difficulty adjustment? Big jackpots for gamblers, has a bit of that addicting ritual that is anchored to an external event (imagine someone counting down the blocks, similar to watching the 11pm news before the lotto drawing), and is a set-it-and-forget-it bet for casual gamblers.

Ah, I like the system of only having secret URLs with no logins needed, but still a bit of a worry that a fusking bot could empty out accounts (I mean, a rare chance, but still a bit worrisome).

My analysis:
EV of 1BTC for 240Mh/s of power
Comparisons vs. GPU mining: $75 for a 7770 (~200Mh/s for 1BTC) &amp; $100 for a 7850 (~300Mh/s)
vs. USB block eruptor (was 1BTC for 336Mh/s, adjusting for USD now is ~1.25BTC)
So, around the same performance/dollar/BTC as current non-ASIC technology, at the cost of much higher variance.
vs. in-hand listings of ASIC technology:
300BTC for 60Gh/sec BFL (2KBTC for 400Gh/s delivered overnight)
230BTC for B2 Avalon --say 65-85Gh/sec (2K BTC for 565-740Gh/s shipped from UK)
So it's around/a bit below par for ASIC technology, at the cost of higher variance. Seems fairly priced vs. the competition for those who are less risk adverse (and have cheap electricity, heh). Also could be a good choice for those who want to find a use for their BTC holdings due to the decreased fiat value.

I would love to get one as a gift for my tech-nerdy &amp; developer friend. I've discussed the basics of Bitcoin with her before, and she's been looking for uses for her rPis.
Giving her an ASIC mining device would give me a great way to explain the power of the Blockchain and how the value of Bitcoin is upheld by the miners. I'll probably get her to mine solo too--the idea of hitting the Bitcoin jackpot could be fun, a bit like giving a scratch-off lotto ticket as a gift.

I agree with a lot of the posts mentioned--roll over bets to the next block/drawing where there was only 1 bet, and the site/system was really simple and well-explained. And to those who want big payouts, what about a larger/biweekly/daily lotto drawings as a sister site?
@_date: 2013-08-13 01:47:56
I don't see a reimbursement yet, but the site still says that my information is still under review. Anyone else in the same boat (FYI, I submitted my information the Monday after the announcement).
