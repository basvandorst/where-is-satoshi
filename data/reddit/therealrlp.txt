This really helped me out, particularly how mining makes money. Thanks a lot for this :D

Will do, sorry for wasting your time. Just thought Reddit was a good place to ask. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:03:55
Okay, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:22:33
Yeah, I'll find some to watch. Thanks for the help :)

I understand that the value is determined by what people are willing to pay. I just don't get why people are willing to pay for it. 
I understand how regular cash works because you do a service in return for money eg your job. But I don't understand how mining results in Bitcoin?

Ok thanks for that.

Sorry, but if you don't want to help then that's fine. No need to be an ass about it.

Its not common knowledge though is it? Most people have no reason to know why money is valuable or have any understanding of economics. 
Now thanks to all the kind people below I now have a better understanding of how Bitcoin works. No thanks to you.

Thank for this. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:54:29
Thank for the response.
I still don't get how Bitcoin gets its value though. I understand that it's determined by what people are paying for Bitcoin at the time. But why are people willing to pay for it? 
I guess the issue that I'm having is that I don't see any kind of exchange of services for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:13:27
Wow okay. It's really that simple huh....
Now I feel kinda stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:31:37
I see. So it's determined only by how much people are paying and selling Bitcoin for? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:30:53
But why are people willing to pay for Bitcoin? Thats what I don't get
