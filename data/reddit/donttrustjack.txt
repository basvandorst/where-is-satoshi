Can someone please explain this to me:
When Bitcoin goes up alts go down
When Bitcoin goes down alts go down
When Bitcoin goes sideways alts go up
I find this really weird, you are trading BTC against an alt. So if the value of BTC goes up than of course the value of an alt goes down. But why do alts go down when BTC gows down??? They are traded against each other? 
Note: I am not talking about the market crash atm, I am talking about Bitcoin vs alts in general on 'normal ' days

IMO you cannot blame him, no one knows the future so no one saw it coming. Dont regret the past, look into the future!
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:01:38
Hmm it says last blocktime 2013. OP is going to have a good bonus for finding the wallet
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:21:21
I think the majority of people who are millionaires because of BTC are just lucky they forgot about their hardrive or USB stick with a BTC wallet and stumbled across it years later. Very few people really saw the potential Im sure.
Thinking about it, if you were in 2012 and you had 1000 BTC you wouldnt think about holding it as an investment. It wasnt meant to be an investment in the first place ( P2P currency and later the drug currency ) so the logical thing to do back then was to spend it. Now there are a lot of people who regret not doing things differently, but you/me/anyone simply wouldnt know what would happen to BTC in the future so why would anyone regret anything?
Think about it this way, what if you really thought it was an investment. Ok, you bought at $30 and it went to $350. Wow, thats over 10x ROI in a relatively short period of time. Such a thing is uncanny and unheard of in traditional markets so you would probably have sold because you already made a big return. But guess what happens years later.... 
The choice we made to be in this space is a choice from a perspective that things will be better in the future. I think that is what most of us should focus on instead of the past.
No matter what choices I would have made in life, all of them would have had difficulties, and there's no reason to dwell on what I could have done differently.

Well you can do whatever you want it is your life Im just giving some kind advice. Your money could literally drop to 0, then what? What if you get fired for some reason then what? The future isnt how you plan it to be. Good luck

Same for you, prove that Im a bcasher.
Im simply asking critical questions but your tribalism clearly doesnt know the difference between critique and bcasher. I literally hold 0 BCH atm and it really sucks that people are 'fighting' instead of asking the important questions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:57
I dont think it will though, the banks have huge power inside and outside of the financial world. They already have a lot of analysts monitoring bitcoin 24/7 so yea...

Ikr but thats why I asked...

No I didnt mention ver at all. I was referring to jihan wu
Relax man...
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:10:23
Not gold no, I dont really trust that alt. There are a few good ones out there you want to be in when this all goes down. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:13:28
Do whatever you want :) if you wanna buy at this ATH be my guest. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:11:38
Ofcourse! But maybe TA wont apply here because of too much hype, but I believe that in the end this thing has to come crashing down. Before it is considered ok growth
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:03:48
Gl! Positive news indeed, may I ask why you guys cannot become parents? Is it something genetic or something else?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:32:12
I can already smell people getting burned hard. The FOMO is so big with this one, once this chart goes the opposite direction people are going to regret not having done any research. If you are one of the people who buys at &gt;$15K than my friend prepare for the worst.
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:55:20
You completely avoided the question
My question is why does a company that develops for Bitcoin have considerable ties to the world bank and the likes of mastercard.
Again, Im not a bcasher and Im still waiting for proof that I am. I hold no Bitcoin cash and Im not even subscribed to the sub. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:07:11
Oh really? Why dont you check my history and prove I am a 'bcasher'?
This is exactly whats wrong with crypto, people dont like being asked critical questions. They like to defend their coin as if its their tribe.
Answer the question. Answer the fact that bitcoin is getting developed by Blockstream. It does the exact opposite of what Bitcoin should be.
This has nothing to do with Bitcoin cash, this has to do with critiquing the development of bitcoin core. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:53:06
This is common knowledge. Most bitcoin developers work for blockstream.
I dont think keeping tx speeds low on purpose is considered great things.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:08:46
People are going to get burned haaaaardd. Sounds harsh but you deserve to get burned when you buy in at these prices.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:02:39
I wasnt referring to ver at all. I didnt even mention him, I was talking about Jihan wu ( who if you look up, absolutely cant deny is not respectable )
All Im asking is why is a decentralized peer to peer currency ( mostly ) getting developed by a company ( blockstream ) that has considerable ties to the world bank and mastercard.
I have repeated this question over and over but until now no one has come up with a good answer. People focus more on fighting and callung each other names instead of the discussion
@_date: 2018-08-31 22:51:29
Idk man you can keep bashing BCH but if you look at the facts than Bitcoin core is getting developed by blockstream who have considerable ties to the world bank and mastercard. Not very decentralized is it
Also tx speed is 7 per second, the developers are keeping it low on purpose. Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer digital cash. Right now its more digital gold IMO

@_date: 2018-08-31 19:32:32
If a respectable person like that chooses BCH over Bitcoin how can anyone call BCH a scam than? I dont understand as Im pretty nutral but I do have big question marks at Bitcoin core's development
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:35:36
Damn, they dont know how to spell but do know how BTC works lol
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:21:07
Why do they call bitcash anyways...
It is Bitcoin cash or some people like to call it Bcash. Never heard bitcash before
@_date: 2018-08-31 19:22:13
I heard that Bitmain is selling its Bitcoin to buy hardware to mine Bitcoin Cash is this true?

Also dont even dare say tge elections were rigged because this was clearly not the case.

Dont base your decisions on what other people say.
I think you should do some research yourself but I think if you want to do it safely you can scale into your buys :)
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:03:32
The biggest thing that is mindblowing is that this corporation ( Blockstream, which has many developers working for Bitcoin ) is funded ( indirectly ) by the worldbank, Mastercard and the federal reserve..................

Well to be fair it hasnt broken the 10k barrier on bitfinex, coinbase and bitstamp so he may start putting some salt and pepper on it first and wait until it breaks 10k on all of them.

Please do not do this, you might harm your finances this way, this ia a very big risk you are taking.
Go read about the New York stock market crash in 1929, one of the causes was people lending money ( which they didnt have ) and investing it all in the stock market because it was going so well and it didnt seem to stop. It caused one of the biggest crashes ever. History may repeat itsself.

Always cash ( some ) of your holdings out at ATH. You will regret not doing that when there is a big correction.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:23:08
What makes you think I hold BCH ... I dont even follow their reddit page. All Im doing is talking about the flaws of BTC and Im getting a lot of stick for it.
High fees are bad for commercial use, mass adoption etc.etc. The off- site- confirmations wouldnt hurt the network if it was able to scale well in the first place. It wouldnt matter if they used or didnt use the network because it could handle it. The fact that you are even mentioning it says enough about the network itsself.
I never doubted the last part but because of the state BTC is in right now there are better solutions. You will be able to see that when looking at the situation objectively.
@_date: 2019-04-28 10:10:13
Did you buy it with BTC?
As much as I like BTC it's not a good currency atm because its very slow and has high TX fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:30
Im being honest here, IM LOVING THIS!
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:28:26
Just for the info, lightning is years away from being finished. Too much hype for it IMO
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:39:23
I knew someone was going to talk about lightning. But facts are that it is years away from being completed. This was confirmed by one of the core BTC developers on twitter. 
If this off chain tech takes so long to be developed how do you expect BTC to handle mass adoption? Forget mass adoption just look back at december '17 what if that happens again? Like I said if the network start getting clogged up again you will pay a ton of fees no matter what and you will wait days for a confirmation.
Also kind of rude to call someone a moron who you never met. Maybe he was just a noob who first started using BTC? Why would you attack someone like that. These are some of the problems with the network and community. 
The network is hard to use: Why should a noob know how to defragment his wallet? He should just be able to do a simple tx without all the hassle.
The network is slow: High tx times compared to other altcoins and it is extremely expensive once the network is clogged up.
The community is toxic: People get attacked when they talk about the network problems or just trying to understand things by asking questions.
Just because Im talking about the flaws of BTC doesnt mean Im a 'bcasher' or 'CW fan'. Yes, for the record I hold 0 BCH and 0 BSV.
Less tribalism more discussion is how we go forward.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:19:49
Ironic how you are telling me to get educated. BTC is slow and has high fees and this is general knowledge. Just a couple of weeks ago someone sent a transaction worth of $1300 to another address. He paid $60 ( !!! ) in FEES. 
Imagine paying $60 and still find people like you who deny that BTC is completely fine. What if the network gets clogged up again like it did in december '17. You will have to wait a whole day for your tx to arrive + you pay a ton of fees.
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:14:41

@_date: 2019-01-17 14:42:07
Not entirely accurate
You get a whole bunch of hard forks with it now..
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:27:16
Partially because the network isnt clogged up and partially because of segwit right?
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:55:40
What if he sold @ $2
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:23:18
I sent BTC from Bittrex to cryptopia so I think it has to do with Bittrex's withdrawing fee. Now that segwit/ lightning is implemented the fees should be lowered
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:34:33
Just sent some BTC from one exchange to the other, impressed with the speed. Normally I would buy LTC, send it, sell back for BTC etc. 
Fee was 0.001BTC and it took ~30minutes-1 hour that is basically the same speed as LTC. Very impressed.
Last time ( somewhere in october ) it took me 2 days or something...
Lets hope it stays like this, because when the network gets clogged again the tx speed goes down amd fees go up.
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:17:43
Yes they were super low, last time I used BTC it took 2 days to receive my bitcoin thats why I always used LTC for transactions.
Why was your fee so low though?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:28:05
Well you dont know where the bottom is going to be now do you? Maybe some TA will help you but if you bought at these prices it is probably because you believe it is going up in the future ( meaning you are here for the longterm ). 
If that is so why do you care about a short term price fluctuation? This isnt the stock market, this is CRYPTO!
You are better off buying now than when it reaches 19k thats for sure.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:44:26
Wait a minute... How are we in a bear market though?

I think you have no idea how many powerful banks there are over there and the people behind then are very influential. If amything they wouldnt want something that can destroy them to gain traction.
Whats up with the r/bitcoin commenter thing, I almost never comment here??
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:12:20
So much hate towards BCH but doing some basic research you will find that the core development team of Bitcoin is under influence of the likes of Mastercard and the World bank. 
So much for a decentralized coin. Maybe google Blockstream and do some research instead of going onto the hate train like a sheep.
At least BCH doesnt have a corrupt background.
AND NO IM NOT A BCH SUPPORTER CHECK MY HISTORY

Idk why ' probability of such attack in the next 10 years ' is on low for China, Russia and USA banning bitcoin. I actually think this is really possible
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:06:19
Also these things are anonymous right? You just put money in and get your BTC but it doesnt work the other way around does it?
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:44:19
You are right, but sometimes people really go too far with stupid things like this. It doesnt make sense anymore and I just want to call out the BS since they really seem to believe what the herd says.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:32:33
Ofcourse you will downvote this, you guys havent done any research and just like to bash something because its a hype or meme. 
Why dont you get some facts on here instead of hide behind the downvote button. You guys are really something else.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:31:02
Looking at the volume indicator we can see large spikes. These large spikes cannot be caused by people like you and me, these spikes are caused mostly by institutional investors ( who invest millions of $ ). 
It is when a large green candle is shown ( on the volume ) that you can know with high certainty that instituional players ( whales, institutions ) are buying in. I dont think that a trader ( even with leverage ) can cause these spikes. You need a lot ( and I mean a lot ) of money to move the Bitcoin chart so thats what I have learned anyways.
Example ( check lowest point of 2018 and watch the volume ) thats when you know institutions buy in. Im not here to argue, this is what I have learned
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:29:47
If only people knew what was really going on behind the scenes of the BTC development they would think very differently about this whole thing. 
Im referring to Blockstream.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:23:42
Just watch the volume indicator it will answer your questions.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:21:48
You cannot see that from just the chart, you will need volume for that or at least the transaction history. It is known that institutional buyers buy at lows like these to sell them when hype goes up again.
