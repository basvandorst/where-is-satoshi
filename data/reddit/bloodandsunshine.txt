my gf doesnt trade actively but I get her to buy the dips. its actually great to compare what holding vs. trading does. 
she makes me look stupid for stressing trades when over time she has almost the same returns making 8 trades in a year.

It's an old article, you may not be wrong but don't let the spread of negative media on these subs influence you

10x less vitamin c than an orange. So still closer than visa and btc as a comparison :)

There's been about 75 days of Bitcoin existing where it hasn't been profitable to buy. The majority of Bitcoin holders are very happy with its performance.

Why would you post this? It's old and now invalidated

I've found that using common vocabulary and emphasizing the tentpole benefits of crpyto (privacy, control, accountability), gets the message behind the price across very well. 
It's not complicated, on a surface level. You have to understand that most people just don't have the vocabulary to talk about it, which could come across as having a lack of sagacity to you.

Nice. It's wild that that people think being vegan is less healthy, more expensive and more complicated than being an omnivore. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:51:15
No, it's because they prefer easily processed, humorous or relevant points instead of complex content. Reddit just isn't the best medium for long form discussion, it encourages reading a header, tldr and a few comments.

who cares, if there was an authority on the topic we'd all listen to that source. since there is not, just read everything and make your own opinion.

Hindsight is 20/20. 'freaking out' is a coping method for dealing with loss.
My profits are still healthy but how could I not kick myself for not selling more near the top?
Not everyone has the badass blood of ice coolness like you.

Damn, they couldn't wait for someone to go in/out of the property? Bunch of Rambo wannabes, pathetic.

you're a very kind soul for explaining it that nicely

there are some universities that have blockchain/crypto clubs or even courses. maybe one of them would be interested in having it for a while? they might even offer to pay for it as there are tax benefits for institutions buying art.

Be grateful that you're smart enough to know this was a mistake. But it's also only a few grand. Take a few months, work hard and recover your losses - being under austerity measures and having little personal enjoyment can distract from the anxiety of your losses and after that, you're in the black again.

They become a specialist or gain experience and negotiate for a raise, much like other jobs.

No, it's good - free and you can go anywhere. It's hard to get a family doctor some places but it's miles ahead of what the USA offers.

I live in Canada. We have good health care from taxes. Not to mention roads and social programs, etc. 
In just one case, how would you propose to maintain public infrastructure without taxes? I know toll roads are an example but they are still subsidized by government.
@_date: 2018-11-08 14:12:51
My mom and her neighbors live in the country, about half an hour's drive from city. There is not enough traffic on their long road to ever possibly pay for its maintenance and snow clearance through the real life Monopoly game you describe. That would put them, other rural communities, Native Americans and farmers, ranchers and forestry at a huge disadvantage.
 Who would decide when the roads have to be maintained? I don't want to have to start thinking about road construction and paying contractors to maintain a road in front of my restaurant. That's not my expertise, I pay taxes so the government can hire engineers and contractors to take care of that. 
Decentralized everything is not the best system. Trustless is good, lack of accountability and direction for public resources are not. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 05:30:43
But then the system wouldn't have enough funding to provide care for when it's needed. I see what you're getting at, and if people only needed medical attention from personal fault, I might be inclined to agree. Everyone gets sick or old though and they shouldn't have to be in debt for life or die a pauper for that. Because the world is so unpredictable, Canada and many other developed countries have national health care systems - it seems to be working very well for all of us and we can't wait for the United States to catch up.
All that aside, I don't have a high income and the taxes I pay are among the highest in the country. Yet I still make ends meet and can add to savings while not worrying about breaking my ankle, losing my job and being out 7k+ for a medical bill. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 00:20:26
nailed it. play fair. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:52:27
would you buy or sell? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:18:43
But then poor boroughs and rural areas would have terrible roads because of lack of traffic and reliance on current public transport systems, though they support the upper class by providing manual and service labor - no incentive to take on a low rate road work job or the work is done at unsafe or subpar levels. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:40:36
I grew up in harsh climate low traffic road and they still had to fix it all the time

I don't have to go, I've seen them! 
But that's an administrative question, Australians pay around 32-35% income tax right? 
The money is there, it's just mismanaged. Crypto won't be a paradigm breaker any time soon in the way we all like to fantasize. Get involved in local politics. It takes no qualifications or experience, pays well and gives you a chance to make tangible changes to your community. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:32:35
I like your optimism and crypto faith but the realities of urban living and international travel don't allow for that scenario

Amazing - I've been planning to do a promo cryptocurrency day/weekend at my restaurant, Mais, right beside Ubisoft in the mile end.

We all not hodlers. There's lots of people who waited out the obvious insanity of late 2017 and are only buying again now. Negative sentiment isn't helping anything!

Start buying again and lower your entry price then!

A good sign that BTC is healthy and it's drops in price are only psychological weak point of the traders.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:27:50
totally. the supreme court in the usa told the baker he didnt have to make the cake for the gay couple. which is fucked up for other reasons but this is a good example of a company refusing service based on moral grounds, I guess.
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:16:08
totally, this would all be so much easier without dumb liars everywhere.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:33:25
The SCOTUS has ruled that companies can refuse to offer service to potential customers on religious/moral grounds. That came from the baker refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. Coinbase is HQ'd in SF so they would likely be able to fall back on that as a defense. 
Bitcoin is DC, but if Milo wants to get involved, he will have to find a company that is okay with serving him or work with private citizens.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:58:12
it sucks that we can't all agree that compassion, empathy, tolerance and inclusion are traits to be admired and all of this xenophobic religious racist shit is not.
@_date: 2019-05-05 00:56:31
on a personal level and if it was my business, I absolutely agree with you; but it sounds like we have a moral compass. 
That would open up the door to racists and bigots being able to deny service to whoever they want. not that we should be patronizing businesses like theirs in the first place; but it enables all kinds of fuckery from the hate-filled people who would refuse service to "lib-cucks" or whichever group of people they hate now. 
anyways, I have no idea how to realistically fix any of that and everything sucks.
