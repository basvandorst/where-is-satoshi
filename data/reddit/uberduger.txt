I'd argue that the time it took to turn a profit as big as all the bitcoins that went missing would have been a really, really fucking long time.
I'm going with the 'inside job' theory until presented with evidence otherwise. In my opinion, the fact that they have been so cagey makes it seem pretty likely. Like 'oh, we have no idea how the hack happened and no idea how they got past security'. 
Even a seriously ethical person would be pretty tempted by that amount of money. You can steal more than most successful robberies in history and the victims have almost no recourse if you run your site in such a way that you don't keep logs. Just rob it all and start planning which private island you want to buy.

Haha, sorry. Spent too much time in recently. I forgot I was in Yeah, as the other guy said, Total Biscuit. He's a YouTube commentator who talks about games / reviews them. He's the sort of guy where a tweet with only a couple of views would be retweeted and be seen by many, many thousands. One of the first ones that came to mind for 'who has a lot of social media followers who may tip him?'.
@_date: 2016-04-21 12:57:15
Yeah, very true. I'd completely forgotten about that.
It sucks how if a company is too morally bankrupt to police their user content areas, the little guy gets screwed while the thief and the company both get money from it. And good luck stopping it unless you are a huge company...

It's a brilliant way to boost the level of people posting on Facebook in the short term, but a fantastic way to make people leave the site either because a) it's full of spam or b) people steal other people's posts all over the place to try and steal their money.
Actually, surely this will be a fucking mess purely because popular people will effectively steal money off the little guy. If someone posts some interesting comment on gaming, and then TB comes along and reposts it, could he give all the tips to the original guy? And what if TB or someone with his level of online popularity comes along and reposts without source, changing the wording subtly? How do we tell who deserves what money?
Sounds like an accident waiting to happen, but one I'd like to watch.

One of the things that got me to dump my Bitcoin Cash was the fact that the sub was absolutely *filled* with posts about why Bitcoin Core was crap. There was almost nothing actually selling the merits of Bitcoin Cash.

To me, it was almost entirely because of the huge animosity that I felt the *other* way. I went to that subreddit to ask some questions, nice and politely (I know this is also what a troll or child would say, but I sincerely mean it), and got insulted by a number of posters. Then I noticed that something like 13 of 20 posts that I saw at the front of the BCH subreddit were bashing BTC rather than actually selling me on the virtues of their coin, so sold up and got out.
To me, the subreddit made it feel like a flash-in-the-pan coin, as it's community was rude to me with no provocation and seemed to be entirely based around trashing another crypto. So I got out and never looked back.
EDIT: I'm not saying in this post that I believe that the community *as a whole* is full of trolls, or that I think the coin has no technical merit, but it was just that I felt that if I was going to have my coin in something, it would be better to be in one that both felt less aggressive and also did something significantly different from BTC.
Also, my experiences are from quite some time ago. The community may be better now but I don't particularly care much any more.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:24:08
Yeah, I always think this when someone says "money can't buy happiness".

But hedging a highly liquid (at least in small volumes) asset that you don't actually *need* seems pretty silly.
I understand the need to hedge income streams or assets that you need for the course of your business, but buying bitcoin and then betting it will go down is surely stupid. As you might as well just sell a bit if you think it's going down or not sell any if you think it's going up.
And I say this as a professional who's broadly in the finance industry.
EDIT: If you're gonna downvote me, at least fucking explain why you think I'm wrong. Because I can confidently assert that if you hedge Bitcoin that you don't actually need to hold beyond profiting from it, you're either an idiot or hold so much that to move it would throw the market out of whack. And if you're the latter, you aren't reading hedging advice on Reddit. If you are the former, you are needlessly eating into your profits, because if you think it might go down, you sell some. You only hedge when you need to ensure a predictable result in the future, which obviously isn't the case when you are holding something for profit.

What is the difference between my Armory passphrase and a brainwallet?
If I've randomly picked out a load of words, is that not a brainwallet? I've heard that brainwallets are ridiculously insecure, but Armory needs you to generate a passphrase when you first make a wallet...
Armory says I need to keep my passphrase, but I can't see anywhere in the Armory restore options for me to actually use the passphrase.

There's stuff that never gets released from licensing hell.
One show I like, Jake 2.0, is only available as 350MB .avi files, and some of the episodes aren't available anywhere in widescreen. There were higher quality rips that someone recorded, from what I can tell, but were for his own purposes and never got uploaded anywhere. 
Trust me, there's rare stuff out there that's only available through piracy. 
(I have some songs from one of my favourite artists that I only have because I was resourceful and found one of the song producers' promo pages (now long defunct). As far as I'm aware, I am the only person on the whole of the internet that has those songs other than the people involved in making them.)

Actually, he's maybe got a bit of a point - you should start with riskier investments when you are young and then gradually move your pension into lower and lower risk areas as you get closer to retirement.
Buying bitcoin as a retirement strategy may be bad financial advice, but the level of risk being linked to your age certainly is not. That's a recognised and useful strategy.

Unless you'd given them a decent amount right before the price went up 10x. Then they'd love you!
But yeah, I agree. Good gift for someone techy potentially, but not for anyone that needs more than about a 30 second explanation of the gift.

Except that then, getting 10BTC would cost you about €100. Now it would be considerably more. 
I would say that for the vast majority, €100 is a far more reasonable estimate of 'disposable income' than €10,000s.
I believe in bitcoin, but I doubt I will try and hold more than 1-2 BTC, as I don't mind losing a few hundred pounds in the long run, but I can't afford to gamble much more than that.
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:24:46
The problem I had was that the 3 times I looked at buying some bitcoin, when the price was comfortably below $100, I gave up because it was hard to buy them from outside the US. It felt like every exchange and buyer I went to relied on me being a US citizen.

Genuine question from someone who doesn't yet understand Bitcoin - how are the transaction fees low? Ive made one BTC transaction and it took a lot in fees. If I set them low, doesn't it take, like a week to verify or something?

Ah well, I'd have probably have lost the password/auth info for my online wallet back then anyway. Maybe it's better to not have had any BTC at all than to have sat on 1000 of them and then forgotten the password/been hacked/stored them offline and had a data loss, which is what would have happened when I was less savvy.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:13:31
What the guy who replied to you said - the bank charge me the cash advance fees for any similar transaction.
So I'd be interested in buying bitcoin with CC if they were treated like an asset, but they are instead treated like an ATM withdrawal (which is fair, I suppose) and so I'd have to pay the ridiculous fees.
That may be one reason why more people aren't able to use your service - they might have checked their bank statements after the first few times and realised that the banks are penalizing them too hard!

I've got no problem with new users asking questions, but you have to assume someone is a scammer when their first post is something like 'I just bought my first 0.01 BTC and I'm really excited but can't spend it all at once because I don't have much money' or 'I'm new to Bitcoin and you all seem like really nice people - I don't understand this changetip thing though and would really like someone to explain it to me' or whatever.
Normally I just downvote and move on, but if the tip-beggar is as blatant as those examples I just gave, then you bet I'm going to call them out on it. My reasoning is not to try and make them feel bad, but just to try and help stop this place turning into some sort of @_date: 2014-03-31 06:45:25

Really? I unsubscribed a little while back, but one of my Reddit apps on my phone still had it there, so only looked again this morning. It's definitely more intense than when I left!
I like that people are trying to expand Bitcoin, but it was a little silly to see everyone sitting around and agreeing that yes, restaurants should take Bitcoin.

I suppose technically the best thing to do, for all browsing and torrenting and everything, would be to rent a server somewhere in Russia or wherever that you've paid for with Bitcoin and route all traffic through it.

And did *you* stop to think about all the admin staff, the IT staff, and all the other entire divisions in the bank that had precisely zero involvement in what the IB division were doing?
Thought exercise: you work for, say, Apple, in one of their retail branches, and are using your wage to pay for rent/mortgage and to support a family. Suddenly, news hits the press that a large chunk of Apple's profits come from the manufacture and sale of illegal weapons, and nobody in the company other than one specific division (and the board of directors) were aware of what was going on. The entire company falls apart almost overnight. You lose your job and are unable to meet your day-to-day financial obligations. Does that feel fair?

It might make the market technically more efficient, but I'd argue that it hinders market growth because why would I want to put any money into a company if a CEO, board member or auditor can just send the whole thing crashing down when they learn the bad news before me?
So, yes, it makes a market more efficient in an ideal situation, but I'd argue that in the real world, we can't possibly have a functioning market based on insider trading. Though if we did, I'd be spending my every waking minute developing new and more hideable listening devices and trying to get them into boardrooms, as you could then trade on any information you heard without fear of investigation by law enforcement, because hey, insider trading wouldn't be the big red flag it is today.

Well, I think the idea is that they use your investment to buy more miners, mine more BTC, and then pay you back your money + a bit extra, representing *the funds they've made with your portion of the purchase*. Not a ponzi.
I'm not saying that all cloud mining operations are legit, but just pointing out that paying you a return on your investment doesn't necessarily mean that they are running a scam.

I'm not the type of bitter troll that you refer to, but the reason I personally missed out was not because of closed-mindedness, but rather that it was really fucking hard to buy bitcoin from outside the US in the early days :( I had a shitty computer so didn't mine any, but if it had been anywhere near as easy buying bitcoin from outside the US as from inside, I'd have a few hundred bitcoin now and be ridiculously better-off!

These adverts make me so damn angry. 
I searched for a TV show once, that had been cancelled some years before and that I hadn't checked on in a while, and found one of these adverts. For an excited second, I forgot that it would be an advert and thought it might finally be available. It, of course, wasn't.
I get why making you click through to the site is good when it's a product you can actually fucking buy, but when it's not, then these adverts are beyond moronic. Who actually clicks on one and then goes 'Oh, that product doesn't actually exist? Oh well, better buy something else while I'm here!'?
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:16:05
I can see your point, but I'm pretty sure its illegal for them to say that "disputing any charges constitutes fraudulent activity". Otherwise surely all companies could just put a blanket statement in their terms saying something like "requests for any refunds shall be considered to be fraud", couldn't they? But IANAL, etc.

This is my question exactly. As soon as you start a CFO role, the *very first thing you do* should be to look at the opening balances of what your company has. If your company is reliant on a huge holding of some investment and you don't confirm the balance of that investment past just getting the CEO's word for it, you're not only a shitty CFO, but should be held accountable for gross negligence.
I literally can't fathom what that guy was doing for the last few months, if not confirming the financial status of the company for who he was in charge of the financials of...

No, the break-in would not be your fault, but if your lock was a tiny flimsy padlock that could be broken with one hit from a hammer, I'd still be well within my rights to point out how stupid a decision that was. 
EDIT: Actually, maybe a more apt analogy would be if you'd locked your door and then given the key to the random person who guards the bus station and told him to keep it behind the desk. Then when someone broke into the bus station office, they took your key. That would not be your fault, but it would be foolish.

One of the main barriers to the use of bitcoin daily by the masses, IMO, is in the fact that there is still a huge learning curve involved in spending them *safely*.
I've got other young people interested in using some bitcoin, but there is no chance in hell I will ever try and get relatives over the age of about 50 interested in them, because I just don't want to have to deal with the potential for loss via technical incompetence. Heck, I have a hard enough time making sure my parents back up their hard drive without trying to get them to back up their money.
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:28:07
The reason I don't buy BTC with a credit card is that my bank would charge me the absolutely extortionate fees that they charge for cash withdrawals on a CC.
In fact, I looked it up on my bank's website, and it appears that interest would be charged from the day I make the 'withdrawal' all the way through to my statement date. So it's a big no-no.
So sorry, but I can't ever use CC BTC sites.
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:31:00
Its insane how much they sometimes charge. Here in the UK, places can advertise their money changing services as "Commission Free!" where in fact they are taking a huge commission - they are just taking it by charging you a massively unfavorable exchange rate.

Because the only people tipping it are desperately trying to make their coins worth something and dont actually care about it as a legitimate currency. A lot of people want Bitcoin to succeed as a currency whereas Dogecoin owners are just trying to make a quick buck.

Exactly. I would think a lot more highly of the tax system and the government as a whole if the effective rate of taxes for a large company was, at the very least, the same as mine.
It's bullshit when you have people paying ~20-30% tax and then companies, through various tax efficient investments and holding companies, pay at ~10%.
I recently found out that a foreign company owning a UK property can structure itself so that the tax on that property is effectively 0%. That's apparently why Britain has so much foreign property investment at the moment.

I have no idea why somoene running an exchange *wouldn't* dabble in insider trading. It's not actually illegal in the bitcoin space like it is in properly regulated financial markets.
If you are going to have an unregulated BTC market, you have to be prepared for the pitfalls of no regulation, like insider trading.
Sure, it's ethically questionable at best (and morally unforgiveable at worst) but as far as I'm aware, it's 100% legal at the moment and I'm not at all surprised that it happens.
EDIT: I am in no way condoning insider trading. But we can't all sit there and pretend that the personal ethics of the exchange-owners make them free from the temptation to legally make some very, very easy money.
@_date: 2015-01-23 08:56:52
I think its the fact that if you are making that much and have enough investment funding to really put so much into Bitcoin, you are generally more likely to either keep it to yourself or at least not take the time to come here and register a new account and type that.
I'm certainly not saying that people with 120k salaries and lots of 'fun money' don't visit Reddit, but the number of these sort of posts makes me 100% certain that most of them are made up. If you earn that much, I'd imagine there are more productive things you can do with your time (either professionally or socially) than come here and make a pointless bragging/advertising post. IMO, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:57:32

I actually felt like Bitcoin Cash might be an interesting thing to be involved in and to embrace the potential, but that community fucking destroyed it for me. So toxic.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:32:17


Yes, absolutely. 100%.
If you use a bitcoin service that allows a deposit either to or from another party directly, and then it turns out that the other party is a money launderer or a terrorist, have fun dealing with that.
If you sell bitcoin to someone and they pay money directly to your bank account and they have links to terrorism, your name is going to forever be on the government's servers as a possible terrorist yourself. That's the sort of shit that gets you on no-fly lists if you're unlucky. 
Call me melodramatic but I really can't be bothered with taking that risk. I'd rather pay the extra little bit in fees and the knowledge that a company knows how much bitcoin I've bought and not have to deal with that.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:23:52
Agreed. I'm fine with dd-mm-yyyy as it's at least consistent. But the yyyy-mm-dd way definitely makes the most sense. Particularly now that computers are a thing!
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:08:04


It's all about what people feel it's worth.
If there was an entire currency based around bottlecaps and ringpulls but cans and bottles were worthless, that's fine. But if suddenly you could convince people to accept the bottles and cans for services, then they will hold value for as long as people deem them desireable!
My guess is that BCH will take the place of a lot of altcoin transactions. If someone never bothered to get into altcoins but suddenly owned some BCH, like myself, they could use that as a kinda alternative to BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:35:18

You use the trezor to sign transactions, so it's like an airgap. If you keep a wallet on a USB stick, you're potentially vulnerable to keyloggers IIRC. 
That being said, I like my trezor, but the Nano Ledger S has support for more currencies, if you decide to diversify (and you probably will once FOMO gets you).

One of their posts was trying to get everyone to sell their BTC for BCH on the same day, hoping to try and damage BTC. It was the most pathetic thing I'd seen on the internet that week.
I was happy to show them respect but they act like such jackasses some of the time that it's completely killed my desire to even look into BCH. When I got it for free, I went to that sub to read about the possible benefits and the differences in tech, and left about 10 minutes later hating the whole thing because of how trolly the whole place was.
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:10:01
I moved mine into other cryptos. Felt like BCH only offered me a similar product to other cryptos, and I feel it's fate (for better or worse) is tied to BTC. So it was better to diversify. Not regretting that decision yet!

Can you suggest a Bitcoin subreddit that isn't full of people being mocking or trolling about others? Because this is the best we've got at the moment.

One of the rules of this sub is "no begging".
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:49:23
I'd counter that with the still relatively high barrier to entry. If Bitcoin became more accessible to the everyday person, then I think it may become more desirable.
At the moment, there's still a fair number of people that have no idea what Bitcoin actually is, and how to buy and store it. I'm waiting for Google or Apple to bake a crypto into their OS, or for Amazon to make their own crypto and bake it into their store. Obviously it won't be Bitcoin but over a long enough time, one of them will, and that will rocket both itself and Bitcoin IMO.
My view of the future won't be BTC on top but it will be coins created by corporations (but still decentralised and mined like normal cryptos) and BTC behind them and still valuable. The reason I think corporate coins will do well is purely for accessibility by the average Joe on the street. Gcoin or Azcoin or Appcoin or whatever will be king if they launch them soon - this is not what I'd like ideally but I'm fairly convinced.

The problem I have with BCH is how their subreddit is full of people just being shitty about another bunch of people. Like every single post is about how this sub is full of idiots and we are all scum.
I could never bring myself to throw myself into a crypto that's so full of bitterness and bases it's entire community on insulting another community.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:44:41
But why though? Why, out of all the cryptos, are they suddenly buying BCH? Is it that someone told them to buy Bitcoin and maybe the word 'cash' in Korean means something different to what it does in English and they are confused and just buy the cheap "bitcoin"?
I'm perplexed as to why they pick BCH particularly.

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:12:57

I'd be so upset if they were my coins sitting locked up in there as the price plummets.
Mind you, this is a valuable lesson for people to control their own coins - if this (and Mt Gox, for those that actually do their reading) didn't teach people, nothing will.
EDIT: What they should offer, although clearly won't, is the ability to do an off-chain sale right now. So you tell them in writing that you want to, and contractually agree to, sell your BCH for market price. Then they lock that price in at that date and the BCH is no longer yours. Then, when Coinbase eventually gives you access, they lock your BCH and make it so that if you don't send them your BCH in 7 days, they take it from you themselves. Then you get the price you locked in at. If I were a lawyer, I'd explore this angle for myself.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:06:25
I've got mine on a Trezor. The main problem I'm having is that if they don't release a coin splitting application themselves, surely I'd have to invalidate the security of my seed in order to get my coins off the 'other' chain?
I like controlling my own keys, but I can see why people might feel compelled to store on an exchange if it does the split for them.

It's like those systems the government and military use where the sensitive system and data never touches the internet.
In a crypto sense, it is having a computer or device that remains offline and using it solely to approve and sign transactions. Then your other computers and see devices can become riddled with viruses and keyloggers and still nobody without full access to the offline system can get your coins.
Effectively the offline system acts like a hardware wallet.

I'm genuinely baffled as to how you see this as a hostile community and don't see any negativity in that sub at all. I'm honestly confused. Maybe it's improved in the last couple of weeks.
I haven't spent time in there for the last few weeks, but I've dipped into it every few days since just before the BCH fork, and every time the entire sub has felt like 80% of the posts and comments is either explaining why their currency is better than this one or why BTC holders are idiots. 
That's what made me sell my BCH for VTC, as VTCs sub was full of info on why their currency was good rather than why another currency was worse than theirs.

I just wish companies in general would take security more seriously, but there's absolutely no reason to in most situations. The public has shown itself on many occasions to not really give a shit about how secure stuff is, and there's no legal compulsion to keep a good level of security (as the fines and punishments are so inconsequential to a major corporation).

I did mine by moving my bitcoin to another wallet (so that my old private key is okay to use elsewhere without losing my BTC) and then 'claiming' my BTC with Electron Cash wallet, which is a repurposed Electrum distribution. But apparently there are other wallets that let you do it. 
Basically you use your original master seed to claim BCH the exact same way you would recover a BTC wallet with it. But you need a specialised BCH wallet to do so. 
Like I said, I used Electron Cash and then moved my BCH ASAP and exchanged it. But there might be a better option now - I just used the first one I could find as I thought BCH would eventually crash so I wanted to get in there early!
(Good luck. Would point you to a guide but I just went off the few posts I saw here on Reddit and can't remember which ones had good guides in!) 
EDIT: The important bit is obviously moving your BTC first. You don't want to give any other wallet your master seed just in case something goes wrong or it's not trustworthy. I was fortunate in that I was due to move mine to my new Trezor anyway.

I'm thinking that too. Once it becomes far easier to buy any coin (or any of the top 10), I'd say that the chances of it being overtaken will rise considerably. It may not be realistic, but it would be a scenario I could easily envisage (say, if Amazon decided to adopt Litecoin or something, or HTC baked Monero wallets into their phones, or whatever).
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:43:01
Yeah, I'd be happy if there was a way to reverse transactions too. 
I guess there are situations where I don't want reversible transactions though - I've sold stuff on eBay and Amazon before and as an honest seller who doesn't lie and sells stuff for a fair price, it would stop people trying to extort or defraud me if I could just sell stuff and then forget about it without them potentially reversing it fraudulently...

Stuff like this is why Google gives a lag to its search data.

Easiest is Blockfolio if you want to do it as a "real time" study.
You can manually add your "purchases", so if you just put a hypothetical $1000 in, or 'bought' $100 of a hypothetical 10-20 coins, you can open it whenever you want and it will tell you how much your portfolio is worth.
Though I highly recommend buying like $10 worth at the very, very, very least, as then your monitoring of the price will mean much more to you and be far more interesting.

I'm of the opinion that if Bitcoin got banned by most major governments, the best crypto to have will be Monero, as an anonymous coin will be the most appealing one to people who are willing to use a "banned" currency method.
I can't see it getting banned. But if you want to help make that not be the case, I suggest trying to spread the word as much as possible. The more people that are trading or using it, the less likely governments are to ban it - they don't wanna piss off voters.

My first experience of analysts was when I used to read about gaming as a kid. People kept saying what Michael Pachter was thinking about the games industry, and it honestly felt as though he was just blindly guessing. Then I grew up and realised that, yes, he probably **was** blindly guessing. 
Anyway, in the finance world, if analysts were good enough at predicting financial markets, they wouldn't be analysts - they would just be incredibly rich self-made millionaires. It's like the logic for why psychics can be assumed to be bullshit - if they were really psychic, they would definitely be doing something more useful than reading palms and telling you what they feel your lucky numbers might be.

Fair points. The fees aren't ridiculous but they certainly cost you, the end user, more than CC fees (if you were liable to pay them yourself).
But either way, it's a damn sight more usable as a currency than beanie babies!

Couldn't that be a huge issue though? If you short USDT and then USDT crashes (like actually tanks to zero if investors all lost confidence en masse), couldn't that take down the whole exchange? Meaning that you'd have earned a whole lot of nothing.

This is what I don't understand. If I send my coins to another wallet, redeem my new coins in a new client and send them to another wallet, haven't I just successfully split them? Start result is 2 forks with the same private keys. End result is 2 different coins in different wallets with different private keys.
TL;DR - Why is this fork more dangerous than the one before?

I'm pretty sure it's not as bad as it was a short while ago as miners are devoting less hashrate to BCH. The fees spiked hugely due to that.
Also, it is bad that many wallets set auto fees. One of mine that I've now got rid of tried to get me to pay about 20x what I needed to in fees.

I am a bit concerned that one day Bitcoin could be overtaken. 
Like, say if Apple and Google both went in on another crypto that you could easily buy with your Apple/Google account and integrated it into their phone operating systems, I'm pretty sure that would overtake Bitcoin within a year.
Not that it's likely, but that's the sort of scenario I see replacing Bitcoin one day potentially, if it were to be replaced.

@_date: 2017-09-21 11:34:31
The only issue I have with that is that exchanges are like having a licence to print money. When they are fully set up and running, the amount of money they bring in must be staggering, if you add up all those fees and try and hypothetically deduct some fixed and variable expenses from those (when accounting for the many, many active traders). 
It seems crazy for them to be perpetrating a scam if they are normally able to sit there and watch money roll in.  
EDIT: Maybe it's one of those "don't attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity" things - like most of the exchanges assume it's okay with the legal defense of "well, we had no reason to doubt it".
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:38:19
The issue I have with this is that if someone *did* generate the same address as yours, the chance is so ridiculously low that absolutely nobody would believe you.
You could one day check on your 1,000 BTC that is meant to sustain your family for generations to come and find out it's been cleaned out by Nobby Nobody who just generated a new seed and happened to get yours. And then you're fucked.
Sure, it's insanely unlikely, but if BTC was to become the dominant global payment method forever, it could happen.
It's unbelievably unlikely, but still possible.

So you're saying it's safer to have all your crypto investment in Bitcoin then rather than split a bit into Monero?
I'd argue that if Bitcoin were to die due to regulation or compliance issues, a privacy-oriented coin would take its place for stuff like drug deals and such. In that case, you'd be happy you had some Monero.
You seem to be confusing his statement that suggests he has diversified a little bit into a coin or two that offer something that BTC does not for him saying 'BUY HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT COINS AS ONE WILL GO TO THE MOON'.
It's not fallacious to invest in an alternate crypto that you think offers something that BTC does not.

I see it as being different than using publicly available info because there is quite simply no way outside of being a search engine to get that data as quickly as they do.

I'd say that having a good dev team and being only a bit decentralized (like VTC for instance) is better than being pushed around by a few big groups of miners like happens to BTC.
If we were truly decentralized, there wouldn't be this odd civil war between 2X and no2X. But instead it feels like the community want one thing and the miners want another.

What I don't get is why there wasn't any legal compulsion to give back the assets they held. Those bitcoin they held were not theirs to keep or to be sold off to pay creditors - they were client monies / assets held on the client's behalf.
Didn't loads of them get sold? The government or whoever bought those BTC were buying stolen assets, as far as I can tell. So the same law should apply - the assets should be returned to their rightful owners.

I agree, though I will point out that the only people who will have made any money out of Bitcoin Gold, other than the scammers behind it, are those who had their coins on one of those exchanges that automatically credited them with it way early.

Yeah, as the other guy said, I'm not talking a currency that they premine or control, but just one with a wallet that is installed straight onto your phone with an easy way to buy and store. Just making buying and selling and storing much easier. That coin would do seriously well, whatever coin it was.
As long as the code behind it was reasonable, it would displace Bitcoin IMO. Again, I neither want or expect this, but it's a hypothetical Bitcoin-killer just because of how easily the layman could get into it. There are still barriers to entry on Bitcoin - not necessarily the purchase thereof but the storage definitely is. If someone lowered that barrier to entry, it would cause a lot more people to flood in, IMO.

I'd be fine with regulation of exchanges, at least on the funding side (fiat to crypto and back). They would definitely try and up their fees as a result, but regulation would mean that at least you know your money is safe, and competition would stop the fees from becoming any more extortionate than they already are on some places (CEX.io, IIRC).
As long as the actual use and exchange of currencies is still free and open, I'm alright with having the actual purchase side of exchanges be regulated. I would welcome it, in fact. I'm still concerned when I send currency to one that if they went under or had a glitch, they might never give my money back.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:01:14

Hydrogen fuel cells are a bit like batteries but we could fill them up with hydrogen and get water as a byproduct.
According to Wiki, Hyundai, Toyota and Mercedes, amongst others, are gearing up to launch cars powered by fuel cells in ~2015. Hyrdogen cells would be a good way of powering lots of small devices. So not a replacement for oil in most situations, but would be good in cars.
And I understand the issues with nuclear, but unless we can massively ramp up our use of solar, wind and tidal powers, it seems to be the only way we'd have of sustaining world power if the oil ran out unexpectedly, as far as I can see.

Which is sad because the only reason the world relies on it is because the Big Oil lobby in America has continually held back progress on alternative energy technologies. I truly think that the best thing that could happen to the world, in the long run, would be if we suddenly discovered we only had 10 years' worth of oil left. Might make people pull their fingers out of their asses and invest in nuclear power and hydrogen cells for once.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:06:37
I wanted to get a whole BTC but the price started spiralling up out of control while I waited for verification (didn't want to use LocalBitcoins because I don't want to get involved in a money laundering investigation after I pay money directly into the account of some criminal).
So in the end I gave up, but I now have less than 0.5 and it's annoying!
@_date: 2013-12-27 12:18:17
I really fucking wish I'd got into Bitcoin earlier. The overheads of running a bitcoin gambling game are as close to zero as you're ever going to get in the casino business, and all you need is the initial capital to fund the first few wins. From there onwards, it's basically a money-printing machine.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:03:36
What if one day someone figured out an easy way to transmute metals from one to another using nanotech? Precious metals would all tank to zero very, very quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:30:59
They are far harder to acquire in the UK than in the US, thats for sure. I consider myself fairly good with tech developments but it took me a fair few hours to understand the intricacies. 
For the average newspaper-reader in the UK, its a bit of a mission still.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:40:45
A 'friend of mine' once had a proxy set up on appspot for getting round filters at work. I used to use it for Imgur. Google 'appspot proxy' and consider setting one up if you're feeling devious!
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:39:17
This is why I find it very hard to take any Bitcoin articles seriously - the positive ones often sound like someone trying to help the hype machine to grow their investment, and the ones who are negative seem like they're either a) jealous of all the money the early-adopters made or b) trying to help crash the market so they can buy in or go 'ha, told you so'.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:49:48
Just FYI - your sarcasm was over the top and not that funny.
Also, it might involve 'higher brain functions', but it's still the lowest form of wit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:40:35
I scanned mine but it still took forever to get verified!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:38:25
Okay, you're the 3rd person to say this now. MODS! SPAM OVER HERE!
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:45:26
Wow. I wouldn't have given him the 1BTC back after that. So he chose not to accept a gift from a friend who believes in something and then suddenly when it was worth something, he comes crawling back? What a dick.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:17:45
THE PRICE IS WRONG, BITCH!
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:33:03
Thats an anti-money-laundering step. If you want to avoid that, your best bet is probably LocalBitcoins, but I stopped using that after realising that if I sell BTC, I have no idea who is putting money into my account on there - if its a criminal trying to launder the proceeds of crime, you might not have a fun few weeks once they link your bank account to his!
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:31:44
If I can think of what site it is, I will definitely say something to them. I think it was a site my friend used for something so I'm going to ask him what it was and try and find it!
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:37:59
I tried to buy a whole bitcoin but it took me approximately 7 ice ages to get verified on anywhere trustworthy and by the time I discovered LocalBitcoins, it was already at aboit $750! Gahd damnit.
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:10:53
Wait, so if I happen to have bought 'older' coins, my transactions will be faster than if someone's just bought a freshly minted coin?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:04:50
Me too! Now all I need is for 1 BTC to be worth a million so I've actually made a decent amount :P
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:05:32
Anyone using 'ez' as an abbreviation for 'easy' needs to be removed from the gene pool. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:37:51
...what's your point? Or did you just come here to make a shitty joke?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:46:48
The "bitcoin elite"? Lol.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:09:56
Why did it have 500BTC go in and then straight back out?! Because someone stole it that quickly?! 0_o
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:24:15
No worries. I just got verification through from them - they were certainly faster than Kraken or MtGox, so I'd still recommend trying. Did get a bit annoyed seeing the price spiralling up and up all the time while I sat and waited.
I'm in it for the long term too, but it would still have been nice to buy a coin at $700 rather than $1200!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:40:30
EDIT: If anyone is wondering, if you see a comment about a glitch in a site that gives out for any bet &gt;20,000, it's probably spam. Have seen comments by 4 different people all saying the same.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:41:58
I wish there was some way of making scammers only scam those with the wealth to be okay afterwards, but the sad truth is that a lot of people who fall for scams are either elderly and vulnerable or people who are themselves desperate enough for money that they are willing to disregard reason and pay a few hundred to someone that promises them a better life.
That gradual realisation that you might have just lost everything you've ever worked for over your life just because you were conned by a smooth talking con artist is not something I'd wish on anyone. And these scammers bring that feeling on a daily basis.
If they are so intelligent, why can't they steal from a business or something, so losses can be absorbed into the profit margin?
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:03:15
I recommend buying just about $100 worth and getting used to holding/storing it before you buy $100k worth. If youre even asking questions like that, youre not ready for 100k worth!
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:12:53
What if I used something like Armory and then encrypted the backup from there with Truecrypt? Would that be relatively secure? Another newbie here who's just bought his first BTC!
Using Block chain at the moment but about to move it somewhere more secure. Got mycelium on my Android phone now which seems to be a more secure way of storing them than Blockchain...
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:57:16
He's probably trying to cause a temporary crash so he can buy in...
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:39:03
This is the only reason I feel the price will shoot up - as soon as there's a way to buy that is easy and secure for a newbie, loads more people will jump in, IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:01:02
I think that sounds like a great idea, but one quick question:
How would it be different from having a laminated QR code paper?!
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:38:50
Take your begging elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:42:38
Quick warning - if you use anything other than LocalBitcoins, it will take you a good 10 days or so for AML verification.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:38:16
Those bloody verification waits have cost me a LOT of money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:32:23
It's impossible to know how high its going to go. I'm waiting now for it to drop a bit before I buy any more. I only own half a coin - wanted to get 1BTC, but it took me so damn long to get verified on all the exchanges that by the time I discovered LocalBitcoin, it was too expensive for me to want to buy in. 
Ah well, you live, you learn.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:46:07
How much do you need to have in your 'wallet' to be able to withdraw funds? Before I considered putting any in there, I'd need to know at what point I can withdraw!

Thanks very much buddy, you're very generous :) Once I get all my verifications approved for various places like MtGox, I will be sure to pay it forwards!

If I had superpowers like flight and super-strength, I'd mostly use them for good. I'd be so moral and upstanding and I'd stand for truth and justice...
...except when it came to scammers. If anyone tried to scam me or con me, I'd pick them up, fly them to an active volcano, and then drop them into the lava. True story.

Wow, what a constructive and useful comment.

Obligatory 'if you keep your coins in a wallet you don't control, then you don't have any coins', etc.

Doesn't that make *biology* a theroretical field then? They have theories that explain reality. And nuclear physics, an area of physics highly reliant on particle accelerator collisions, is based around theories that explain reality. I wouldn't call that a theoretical field.
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:15:29
You could potentially get in trouble if you bought BTC off someone who was laundering money. Of course, the truth would eventually come out that you're not a criminal, but good luck trying to explain to the police why money of yours went backwards/forwards with some sort of fraudster under investigation...
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:11:19
We use metric in the UK but still dont do that dot, dot, dot, comma thing. I agree that a period is the more logical way to denote the start of the units below 1 whole 'piece'.
And this is coming from someone who'd very much like the world to do dates like 2013-11-26.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:29:02
I am absolutely certain that at some point in the near future, someone high up in the UK government will try to falsely link Bitcoins to terrorism and child pornography and try and have them banned.
This country's govt has continually shown that they dont understand technology one bit. Sigh. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:28:49
I just wish verification didnt take so damn long on these places! I was buying with LocalBitcoins but can't do that now any more, its far too expensive!
Edit: Cheers for the tip though, I didnt know about OKPay.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:35:40
Could be! Who knows?! I hope the Winklevoss twins are right and it keeps climbing, but it could equally crash once the media lose interest and all the speculators head back to other investments!
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:41:19
That verification wait is a killer, huh?!
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:08:30
Thanks for the reply!
I am just making a paper wallet backup now. One thing that confused me though - if I made a paper wallet backup (via, say, Mycelium), and someone stole my BTC from my unlocked phone, what would happen when I used the backup? One thing that really confused me! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:30:20
Theres a subreddit where you can take your clothes off for bitcoin payments/tips I think. You should try that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:43:31
Yes, but then what happens? People buy the cheap coins.
I know if I saw BTC for anywhere close to $100, I'd snap them up.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:27:40
I guess so. But the only reason I was concerned after I used LocalBTC is that this is the first time in a looong time that I've actually put money into someone's account directly without having ever met them face to face! I just feel more comfortable paying the money to a company. Probably a bit silly, but I just kept thinking how much of a hassle it would be if I accidentally traded with someone shady!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:34:49
You're the second person that's posted about this recently and the other one gave me a different web address.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:23:29
That would be amazing to have that as her middle name or something.
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:12:19
So you come to and try and promote the currency you have bought/mined to try and help push its value up?
Fair enough. Seems legit.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:32:23
Fair enough. I don't mean to cast aspersions on your friend really, but it just seemed a bit odd to me for him to come back *still thinking it was a pump and dump* and yet willing to take it and sell it!
I can't really comment without knowing him, I guess. But if he genuinely believed that it was a con and his friend was financially invested, he would have spoken up.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:15:37
Nope - the UK, or as I like to call it, 'We wish we were America'.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:23:55
Did you use an alternative site instead or just wait for MtGox? I'm waiting on verification now... Its unbelievably frustrating!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:33:05
If it takes 12 minutes, why is it Blockchain.info can show me transactions on an address just by typing in the address and clicking the OK button? Genuine question - I'm a little confused!
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:55:40
Thats how much I have. Now all I need is for one BTC to be worth 10,000,000 and I'm all set.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:44:10
It upsets me that I'd probably see this film. I'm past Adam Sandler films, but I think I must have fallen on my head as a child or something because I still find some Rob Schneider ones quite watchable.
I think I just really liked Deuce Bigalow.

Since I'm not an FT subscriber, anyone fancy copying and pasting it for me?!
I'm assuming it is just some new terrible knockoff.

That was nice. I'd completely forgotten about it in a different bitcoin wallet but went and checked on it the other day and it had gone from 9p to about £1.00. Wish I'd had more karma now :)

Ouch, that's painful. Poor guy. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:08:48
I'm a bit worried that this is the main reason people are climbing over themselves to accept bitcoin at the moment. "Go on, grandma, accept bitcoin for your homemade slipper shop! Its free publicity and you might make a fortune!".
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:13:43
Guess it would be nice to not have the primary miners not just being people who can afford powerful GPUs or server farms... But I'm not a fan of having loads and loads of altcoins. Seems like everyone is setting up their own in the hopes of becoming Bitcoin's successor if it fails in some way.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:20:22
I'm waiting on verification from about 3 sites, and all the time, the BTC price is climbing. FML. Did you end up using LocalBitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:29:29
I would like to know this too! Change addresses are the only bit about Bitcoin that I really feel lost on now.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:24:24
Nice idea, looks great. I'm relatively new to so it has the distinction of being the first piece of true Bitcoin art I've seen. Did you need a ladder to get it up there?!
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:10:14
MOVE THE MONEY OUT NOW!!!!!!!
Also, don't use a Brainwallet.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:39:22
I don't think it's circlejerk - I think it's people who own/mine 'Dogecoins' trying to boost the value by getting people to use it via small tips.
Either way, it doesn't belong in /r/bitcoin.
