I see what is probably my final balance of 17.99* BTC, but there are a handful of other similar balances and not quite sure which (if any) is mine. Don't have UUID or time to traverse linked txn histories.

Only for the first go around. Everything is gross and old after that. :(

Sohry, sohry, sohry.

Please respond with amount. I've been waiting much longer.

I don't know how this works legally but I would have to agree with you on this. There is also stuff on contractual obligation that might come into play.

You dog!

I am (proudly) one of said Graviteers, and thank you, I'm going to follow up on that. I've reached out to MagicalTux via IRC now also.

You're a presumptuous one. The $90 mil was in USD, not BTC -- maybe that's why I don't know whom to talk to at Gox. Thanks anyway. :P

He reminded me of a guy I knew with a French accent, but he said he lives in CA. Maybe he is a new transplant here from French Canada.

I just broke my neck looking at that but I'm still happy.

Going on a couple weeks here for first $1k withdrawal. I have a few other $1k withdrawals I've initiated since then. WTF? Bull shit.

This is quite a reasonable post and I fully agree... The hitman stuff,  if true, not cool! Will not support until we know more about the legitimacy of those charges.
@_date: 2014-02-05 09:36:05
In regards to withdrawals not happening, yes, but like everyone else on here, they haven't responded.
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:52:08
But... but... but... Downvotes! D:

Tired and eyes blurry, misread this as "NEO &amp; BEE to bring Bitcoin to Obama".

In Japan, right? I'm in California but I could travel out there if I can schedule a meeting with MagicalTux or other. I'd rather not fly out just to walk to the office and have no one to talk to when we get there.

Now I'm hungry.
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:54:22
Thank you!

Don't forget about chargebacks... Such a joke.
