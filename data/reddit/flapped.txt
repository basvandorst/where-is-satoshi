seriously. i just got into buying bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, went through all the work/risk on my end to get level 1, and i was a week away from level 2. i could use around 5 btc a week honestly, and getting it instantly would be awesome. i bought .5 btc thursday at 10 AM without instant buy and i won't get it until THE END OF THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. please god get some competition, i'm tired of waiting fucking 6.5 days to get a small amount of bitcoin.

i bought some btc off of coinbase at 10 am thursday the 9th, and won't receive it until "the end of the day wednesday the 15th"... the risk is honestly too high to buy off of coinbase, i have no clue why i did it in the first place.

These comments are why I scroll to the bottom of any Doge-related post on So edgy, so hip, wow.

interesting. i'm an idiot riding the hype train so this might be a dumb question, but why do i see the money being pulled from my bank account by coinbase usually a day after making the purchase, but still having to wait the 4-6 days for the 'bank'?

Oh calm the fuck down gentlemen, I started crypto with doge &amp; am very passionate about it, but this comic was fucking hilarious.
Get a sense a humor bruhs.
