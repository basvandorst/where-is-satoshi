Why is that?

Not sure what you mean by mining is centralized. If you use a third party node, like the one I provide, the node is part of a decentralized p2pool network. If you don't like the node for some reason you can move to another one and still be on p2pool.
Forgive any misunderstanding, maybe you can clarify that point.

Excellent epilogue.
To me, it also seems the Gatekeeper is not our master or our enemy, we hold those roles in and of ourselves. Understanding that has helped me move forward.

I agree :)

You're missing the forest for the trees. Yes, individual nodes are points of centralization, but the p2pool nodes in aggregate are a decentralized structure. You are right that proprietary pools offer more features, but they do so at the expense of transparency.
It would be best if everyone mined on their own p2pool node. However, some miners are willing to help lower p2pool variance and care less about features and ROI. For these miners a node like mine is useful. The hope is that eventually everyone who mines runs their own p2pool node, maybe even the large proprietary pools.
tl;dr; Third party p2pool nodes are a short term solution to get more miners on the p2pool network to help lower variance. You are right that everyone should ideally run a p2pool node themselves, but until that happens, it is worthwhile to contribute to p2pools overall hashing power even if you are unable to run your own p2pool node.
