watch the movie transcendence with johny depp. when the AI goes online..it repairs his own code himself. it gets very smart quickly. it goes to trade markets and becomes rich very quickly. then it buys components and builts new energy (solar panels). it builts his own army. and so on. 
long story short: we will be the apes for them.

i dont trust any exchange. so i will not leave my real btc there till the fork happens. think i should better wait and then dump the s2x. with bcash it was more easy. i have split them by myself (bitcoin core/bitcoin abc) then put the bcc on a exchange for getin btc
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:45:52

@_date: 2017-05-04 16:21:55

craig and roger are alpha males. kind of psychopaths. but their problem is the world has much more alpha males outside the power so they dont give a shit about alpha leaders. they would kill the leaders if they get them. thats why political leaders needs police to protect themself

@_date: 2017-07-03 14:41:04
thx. 
there must be more promotion. nobody knows about this. 
i see the app is still in a very Proof of Concept/Alpha stage. do your homework devs :-)
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:29:44
if the price goes up. yeah i will be rich.
if the price goes down. yeah i can buy more for smaller price
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:44:30
thanks for the link. i see this was on 2015.
now things have changed for the better. in 2017 space is cheaper. the core devs have to bring out an full node app. people can use it strickly on WiFi with charging cable if they are at home. no need for smartphone nodes beeing 24 hours online.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:36:43
that doesnt matter. english is not my mother language. but im sure ur roger ver or r/btc propaganda doesnt have effect on me

''I am against BIP148. I am also pro SW2x''
