Looks great but what about security?

You guys are too critical. Yes, RealSolid is still admin. He has brought on mods though that should help support. The site had to be re-built and yes, in November he did take it offline until this week. MXFees are worth more now than when I bought them months ago . . . 
I'm exited RealSolid has followed through with getting the site back up in the time frame he estimated with all new features and everything working perfectly. 
I haven't heard about accounts automatically closing after two months of inactivity. Is this stated in the terms, has it happened to you or both?

How does it work?
there are many other types of scrypt coins, which are, at times more profitable to mine than Litecoins, LTC
we automatically switch scrypt mining to most profitable altcoin
LTCRabbit automatcally exchanges the altcoins to LTC
you get paid comfortably in Litecoins every hour (PPS altcoin bonus on top of regular payment)

I agree, with bitcoin being trackable and all I really don’t see how it would help . . . 
Below is some text from the site:
Completely erase the origins of your bitcoin and de-couple them from previous transactions. We launder bitcoin to protect your financial privacy online.

Let me rephrase this . . . what's the best deal on mining contracts right now?

Awesome. We still have a few things to hammer out before Press Release. Stay tuned my friends.

I was wondering about that. Not sure why they banned me :( I do very much appreciate you reaching out and assisting me. I will contact the mods as you have recommended. 
Best, John
