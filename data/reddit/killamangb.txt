I would sell them if I was you and take it as a good profit

Still not gone through been almost 11hrs now

Yeah thats what happened man, and no I watched all 3 of them on my app get the confirmations at the exact same time. Its because they all come from the same wallet so are all linked and will be mined together

 &lt;&lt; thats my latest one of the 0.80 with the higher fee that I sent

I use blockchain and I have 2 wallets on there so I used the wallet I used for the first 2 transactions to send £0.80 to my other wallet with a fee of £1.54 hoping that it would push my previous transactions through with it and it worked

I do use one that corrects the fees for me just the way I worded it
@_date: 2017-04-27 23:12:34
Sorted it now I sent another transaction of £0.80 with a fee of £1.54 15 mins ago and now all 3 transactions have 2 confirmations

No my btc address changes constantly but still the same wallet
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:39:55
Thanks, is there anyway I can speed it up? I can pay extra to get it mined faster if theres anyway I can do that? Blockchain set that as the fee and usually does it within an hour

Make a new btc address and then go to your wallet you used to send the btc and send another transaction to your new wallet. You can do as low as you want but put the fee up to $1 and this transaction will go through and push the previous one through with it
