I saw you posted ["Guys, if all of the traders on here get together and plan a time to dump our current coins we can drop the price enough to buy again for cheaper to profit more"]( You're a lost cause who doesn't listen to good advice.
Also, who won the tip? Empty promises from an empty man.

I'd love to hear what information you presented to the class
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:18:07
Anyone? please :(

I get it sent to me threw email, but i worry that someone will access it and then get my wallet. 
I've never seen that page thank you for the link!
another question, once you use the backup thats encrypted, does it make it inaccessible after that?
The big bug that worries me is that once I used the encrypted wallet file (so im sure the passwords were correct) the second password no longer worked for me.
Also, thanks so much for replying. I was beginning to feel hopeless.

Could you please? :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:31:22
Thank you! Disabled and it's never coming back
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:32:30
yes but I'm talking about once I have already logged into my wallet, and am now in account settings &gt; passwords tab. Or to even see the mnemonic  passwords.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:09
I can see it, but when I click it, it asks for the second password.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:00:01
oh? I had used the backup once and I don't recall it asking for a password... perhaps I'll give it another try in case I remember incorrectly.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:38:11
Thanks so much for baring with me here.
I want to make it so that one cannot use the backup file without a password. In case someone finds my flash drive, or gets into my email. Isn't this what encryption is? 
I also want to understand how to use it so something like what just happened doesn't happen with my real wallet. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:10:29
you're too kind! I have you tagged as savior :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:47:27
i made another post, this is so buggy!!
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:05:57
Isn't java needed for some things? are there safe alternatives?
I haven't seen any such warning :(
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:40:19
don't you have to import the paper wallet into a client anyway to use the btc?
im still a little confused how this happens as i would of course want to avoid it at all costs.
this sounds like a major flaw .
why cant the change address just be the original one i started with?
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:59:10
correct, I am using a blockchain wallet
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:40:20
Am i the only one still confused?
If i make a paper wallet, and send a fraction of the btc to another address, the left over change (the majority of the paper wallet address) get sent to a new address??
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:28:09
I will perhaps try again with a few more test wallets to make sure the problem doesn't happen again with my real wallet. 
Thank you so so so so SOOOOO much! I wish I could give more upvotes, truly. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:11:29
Interesting. Thanks for confirming.
I didn't think this could happen with the extensions..

Hopefully I made it before this is over

If i had more coins I would definitely share, but I spread Bitcoins via word of mouth. The good news is Bitcoin is so revolutionary that it's working pretty well so far. thanks TheDJFC

No. I know I am typing in the right password, as it worked earlier and since this was a test wallet, I had made it the passwords I normally use as opposed to a special bitcoin password. It worked earlier because I had imported the backup into  without logging in. Does it kill it self once you use it or something? 
This is my confusion. 
I had set up the 2 passwords, and then shortly after it no longer works! I don't want to do this with my real wallet and lose everything forever. 
If I'm still too confusing to understand, perhaps someone could walk me through the right way to go about this?
