Thank you for investing your time in confronting me, it is always interesting share our point of view. And sorry if I started the talk in a not so useful sarcastic tone, but I really feel deeply this affair.
Have a nice day, namaste

So we all eat biological food and we wear organic fabbrics, aren't?
Sorry,  unfortunately it doesn't work that way.

Cherry pick quoting? ;)
I doubt Satoshi would be happy to remove the financial control from the hands of corrupted banks to give it to some corporations. Because I suppose their are exactly the same.
Capitalism has a wide spectrum, I think this is the dark side.

It is write nowhere that our behavior have to follow the capitalism path, obligatory. And it is simply false that the "*optimal outcome is attained*" from the market. I think it is superfluous to point you to the problems that the extreme, ethic free, capitalism had created, starting from the poverty increase in the USA.
Of course the sellers have the right to decide what to do with their hardware, but should act with reasponsability without harm the community. Create **your own product**, an altcoin, even in the form of a bitcoin fork with replay protection, **name it in a different way** and mine it. The open source generosity is not an excuse to attack or steal.

In fact I'm talking about values that should be not mixed with taste or fashion, such as healthy and ethic. With these you should not even play compromises with costs too.
However it appears to me that the real subject here is not the customer, the **unique seller** (group of miners and financial corporations) is the actor that is making a choise and impose it to all the community.
So we are not talking about a free choise anymore, it really does not matter which market point of view you trust. 
Edit: and yes, I think that bio food and organic clothes are always the best choices, if they are expensive let's buy less
