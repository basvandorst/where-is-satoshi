What is the benefit to getting attention?

Changetip what donut you know costs $0.35?!
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:37:09
What? Explain how the $40 thing works.

You should make the "mmkay" thing YOUR thing!  Funny!

Regardless of the 2fa on your Gmail account, the emails are still routed through your unsecure Comcast account.
If you keep your gold in a safe, but before you put it in there, you let it sit in public for 5 minutes, you're not really using the safe.

I mean...that seems like a fair amount of money to pay a no-name actor for a 30 sec spot.  How much do you think they should pay?

@_date: 2014-06-13 03:38:54
I never thought of that.  That's great...as blocks become more difficult to mine and the number of transactions increase the cost per transaction should plummet.

Right but how are you keeping *that* password safe?

OP doesn't work for SAP though.

Bitcoin can replace both systems so let's compare it to everything.
Where are you getting that information that bitcoin fees are 3% from?
If you want to still talk bank transactions though, I can wire fiat starting at about $35 (depending on the bank) and up.  Look at any major bank's wire fees posted online and you'll see what I mean.
If I'm sending $1000 with bitcoin it costs me $10.  If I'm sending $100,000, bitcoin would cost more, but I don't think I'll do that more than a couple times in my life.
So what's your point?
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:53:02
I mean, anything you read could be fake, but I just don't see the motive here.
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:40:12
What exactly is wrong with an ad hominem attack on you in this case?
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:34:37


Yes.  You're assuming that their sole motivation would be to profit from double-spending.  What you're not considering is that they could be looking to profit from massively shorting BTC.

I'm just mentioning it as a rare possibility, but one that still merits some attention.
Your money being stolen from a bank (in the traditional, armed-robber sense), or a bank run are rare possibilities too, but we have high security bank vaults and FDIC to protect from that.
What exists to protect Bitcoin from this 51% attack?

There is a fee for moving money too it is just spread across everyone who uses a credit card for the time being.  Credit card processing fees are currently around 3%.

To help set your money up in places where your suddenly greedy relatives and friends can't convince you to spend it.
@_date: 2014-11-07 15:06:17
No way.  We are not talking about even close to enough money to risk an online restaurant review shitstorm.

I haven't forgotten the name since the first time I heard it.
What would your suggestion for a name be?

Good job!  You managed to point out what is different about those two scenarios.  Now can you tell us what is the main similarity?
@_date: 2014-11-07 19:47:50
OK, let's talk tips then.  How much in tips do you think this guy could reasonably generate?  $5?  $10?
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:11:41
I just transferred money from a savings account to a checking account at a different bank, both in the US.  It took 4 days until the transfer cleared.
If you are talking about a bank wire, those are faster but there is a fee.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:32:10
It takes 3 or 4 days to transfer fiat money between bank accounts.  Bitcoin is a lot faster than that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:40:11
This is not useful because the US government can choose to deny your request when the information is deemed vital to "national security".
They define what "national security" means, so for all but the most tame inquiries, the answer is "get lost".

I'm told ICBIT and Bitfinex offer this option.  Also it could be done privately.

Sure, but I can write a program for Windows and absolutely no one else would use it.  
I was tempted to think this was big news too, but we'll have to wait and see.

So an agency specializing in space exploration did one single study that says we "may" be going into collapse?  
Circle the wagons.

That makes sense, because people in the UK misunderstand tipping so badly that they think a stale supermarket donut would be considered appropriate for a tip.
