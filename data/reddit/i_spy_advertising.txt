My way out to fiat is through Bitpay and or Coinbace accounts, I can "invoice" and pay myself out of bitcoins in an instant and have real cash sent directly to my bank if I ever see real trouble brewing.

It is heavily censored, if you go to r/bitcoinmarkets where people see bad news and a drop in value as an opportunity. you will find a truer balance of news relating to the rise of the Bitcoin. 
So this dose not get deleted.

Dam right they are PROFESSIONAL. I'v followed these guys from the start. They communicate in a timely manner, they layout goals with deadlines and hit them, they follow through with everything they do. Cyprus embrace guys and you just might find yourselves at the center of a new world economy.

I'm in the UK and new to bitcoins and I'v spent the day looking for a place just to buy one bitcoin and in short you can't!
the only place as far as I can tell is bitcoins-24 via a bacs transfer costing me £10 to send the cash + £2 to receive it. Any ideas?
@_date: 2013-05-31 05:38:34
Its inevitable. Fiat is based on the creation of debt.

I can't see anything going wrong with Bit pay aka Paypal controlling the entry and exit point of Bitcoins

Interesting read. I'll find the French thing when I'm at my main computer. Come over to r/bitcoinmarkets l think they would appreciate your tone and comments.

I think Paypal aka bitpay will move to control the entry and exit point of bitcoins within the US. Coinbase will look to become legal, only once it is pressed to, this will be initiated by PayPal in an attempt to reduce coinbase market hold, only once paypal are ready to move and have seen the market mature more.

Stop posting until you have something to show, Reddit is aware of you and your offer of 0% fees. But the kraken is first out the gate.

 Bitcoin has "Value of its parts" held within the cost of mining, like any other store of value (gold or diamonds) have a floor value, that of cost of production. Everything is inherently valueless but some things cost more than others. Just saying :-)

Planed obcelence, (can't spell that one) big tech firms give current generation technology time to pay. Bitcoin hashing is an arms race without restraint, the loser is all the smaller players.

Don't they charge you £20 for the privilege of serps + their special exchange rate to change it from GBP to EURs, and once it get to bitstamps bank in EUR they convert it into dollars? sounds simple and cost effective.
