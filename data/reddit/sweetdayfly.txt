Not all my clients are regular ones. And then not all of them suggested Bitcoin but use cash. But I agree, I could probably do prepay with regular clients that suggest Bitcoin.

Awesome. This is awesome. 
Although it will take me time to understand all the differences mentioned here. Lots of helpful theory here... I will soon install mycilium on my phone as many suggested it here. Then I get a practical idea of the keys that are mentioned here.

It's not a problem that I can't spend it for a while. I was more afraid that it would take too much time until I can be sure the payment is through and irreversible. 10 minutes is ok, just 1 hour wouldn't work as I demand payment before things happen. Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:10:32
That means it would be wise to have two mobile devices?
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:59:22
Collected! Thank you, this will be used to see how it works :) Thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:34:36
Thanks but I manage that alone :)

After going through this thead and the answeres here, Bitcoin sounds more secure than cash related to my job. It's daunting to have that much cash hidden in one of the rooms.
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:55:21
I saw the changetip comments and was unsure. This is Bitcoin going through Reddit? It's appreciated, but not sure if I want to accept this. Some said Bitcoin transactions are traceable. I think I rather buy from a company. Anyway, much appreciated. How can I deny these?
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:07:03
If things work out well, I might suggest it to others :) Thanks for all the advise! I agree, it's probably wise to think one step further.
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:57:46
Thank you. I did collect this now. I will use it to see how it works. Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:55:12
Looks like they show their own pictures there. I wouldn't do that. Thanks anyway. But I will check out if they have guides there as you said.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:52:42
Thank you, lots of informations in your post. When I asked google about Bitcoin, I saw people claiming that it could be one major and future payment option. At the moment the majority of my clients do pay with cash, a minority asked for Bitcoin. That means it wouldn't hurt if I just store the Bitcoin amount anyhow because at the moment I do live from cash. But using Bitcoin to pay for a few things, I would like to try this out then too. When it comes to the wallet, I see a lot here to suggest Mycelium. Thanks for taking the time to give me all the informations! Very helpful!
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:16:51
When I created this post, I told myself that I won't give out much personal details. I can not tell you. I can just tell you that you are right, it is not English :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:39:42
As others mentioned, I might only take Bitcoin with regular clients that use Bitcoin. When they trust me, they can prepay one hour earlier. This sounds secure to me. I can not plan in plus one hour for each client.. there are others too :D
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:08:27


That is something I have read and it made me think that it is a really nice option in my case.
I am also so far that I know about these wallets but I am uncertain as one website listed quite a lot of them. It's confusing. Thanks for your input!
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:33:52
Not sure what you are talking about but prostitution is tolerated where I live.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:27:33
That sounds very technical.
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:05:26
Thank you, I think I will write this on two papers. I have no technical background to understand encryption. Lots of thanks for the advise!
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:07:16
But you are aware that hookers have a real life too where they go home, watch TV, using the internet and so? :) I have a main account on Reddit since 2 years, of course I don't use it to announce what I am working...
Here is another term that makes you wonder why I know it.. if I would have written the post with my main account, all kind of people would try to find out who I am... you maybe heard about reddit doxxing?
And I am so lucky that I created a new account. You can not imagine what kind of PM's I got today. Horrible. People asking for personal informations and what not.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:14:09
You're right. I am careful.
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:20:33
I think only regular clients would do that. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:08:12
It's a little bit much :D
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:17:17
Cool thank you! I will read the article to see how you handle it! Cool!
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:32:31
The part with the irreversible transactions is what made me keen-eared. It's sometimes daunting to have cash hidden at work.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:28:57
I got it now. This is a good explanation! Awesome.. This sounds much more secure than cash because after some hours work I usually have a bit of cash hidden where I work. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:11:48
I think I have a trustful person that I could even give a pile of cash (family member) without problems. There is no problem. But your advise is good anyway.
Thanks for the link... I will take a look. :)
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:20:42
I think some people mentioned 10 minutes here and I thought it wouldn't be a problem then. One hour is much more of a problem. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 01:25:02
I have installed this now on my phone. I did send Bitcoin to it to see how all this works. I will install this on a second device so that I can test a bit. :)
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:12:57
Not sure if this is very secure. I rather thought to buy a little bit once I understand some things here, so that I can experiment with the solution. :)
@_date: 2015-04-03 22:11:19
Thanks that sounds simple of course. Also I saw mycelium suggested a lot here. I will try this out later with more time to see it in practice. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:36:14


Thanks for the clarification. Then it is less of a problem in my opinion. I was afraid someone could see all transactions over a given time. But it is cool that the address is different each time :)
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:39:46
Thank you, I will check this out... it seems many suggest the same.
@_date: 2015-04-05 01:23:02
I did that now. I had to type this large address by hand on changetip. I think they could improve this anyhow.
But now I see incoming Bitcoin on Mycelium :D 
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:09:33
This is something I need... I need a solution that works with mobile device. But what happens if someone would steal the device? Is my money lost then too?
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:58:37
Collected. I will use it to see how all this works. Thank you much!
@_date: 2015-04-04 13:16:34
Thanks for explaining. But this brings up a question again related to my job...
When I take Bitcoin from my clients, everyone can see it just because of the address they send to? And if I decide to exchange the earned money to cash, what kind of details could my clients find about me? I am afraid they will know more about me than I like.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:21:32
So this is acting like a password and a person who would find/steal my phone can not move amounts without it, only with the difference that I can use the password also to restore it at home with another phone? This is genius to be honest!
