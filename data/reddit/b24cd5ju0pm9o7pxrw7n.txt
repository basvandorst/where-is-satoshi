    Also do not email us asking to confirm what information we have about you. If gox had it, we have it, and as you can read on boards we have confirmed possession of this dump for many people.

It is basically nothing on it's own, as, to spend it, you'd need another address to pay for the fee, and, it only pays for the fee in-of-itself.
I guess it'd be useful for an special kind of "No spend" transaction where the whole input is sent as a fee.

Computer died once (Apparently watching content on Plex &amp; maxing out my GPU = bad time), then I rebooted and tried it again, it took ~ 40 minutes (And, in fact, actually went up to 94% likelihood of getting the address before I actually got it. Just. My. Luck.)
The shit I do for absolutely zero reason.

What's the point of making something if nobody checks it? Anyway, even if you got something wrong (Which, you didn't, it was my fault, sorry!), least it was a time for learning. I got something wrong, and, I actually learned that there was a program called "xxd" that can dump hex &amp; do the same in reverse. Never needed the program before, never knew about it, now, I do, so, if the error ever pops up again where I need to either hexdump or do the reverse in bash, I now can. As the popular saying goes, "You learn from your mistakes.".

Not too sure I understand how you managed to get 'a6bfbc66bb388ed60fde4982587d7193b0ad1eadc2200562b10aa009e7760a08'.
We start off sha256suming the whole lot:-








Now we concatenate them, "{file}{proof}{zip}", so:-


This is whree I'm confused, how do I get from that too "a6bfbc66bb388ed60fde4982587d7193b0ad1eadc2200562b10aa009e7760a08"? Sha256suming it?




Not valid.




Also not valid.

Unsure about changetip, but, I got [an on-chain donation with bitcoin tip of .32BTC]( so, are you sure it's not just up to the user if they want on/off chain?

You're saying the hash:-

correct? If so, I still don't get it, even when using a web hasher instead of sha256sum:-

My reply should be there, top comment (as of now). Explains indetail how to include custom bytes in a OP_RETURN, this is just one of thousands of ways to include custom bytes in a BTC transaction.

Technically, if they're buying a large enough amount, it could be considered money laundering (I think... I'm no lawyer, I just remember reading about some Florida dude that got busted for it).

I assume you buy it off sites like coinbase that require all your personal information?
Unfortunately, I don't really trust sites like that, hell, look at gox, I believe there was a dump of all their customer's private info (Pastports)? No. I try to be as private as I can (Hell, look at my username). It's probably very easy if you do trust those sites, unfortunately, I don't really want to, probably why I have such an issue.

That would only work if the virus signature was equal to or less than [twenty bytes]( (How large an addresses customizable bytes are (Four extra parity bytes)).

Very much so, I own a couple of bitcoins (More than five, less than fifteen), and, I've been in many choices where sites say "You can pay with bitcoins, and, get 10% off, or, pay with paypal/CC", and, I think to myself, "Well, I could get 10% off now, but, I know if I just wait a month, I'll probably make that 10% back anyway", so, I paid with PayPal. That's when I'm getting a discount, majority of sites are just 1:1, so, my point of view is "No, I don't want to spend them". They were a pain to get (Considering nobody wants to spend theirs) and will probably go up in value. It's 100% an issue.

Whoops, I'm use to services just hashing the hex-hash, I can verify hashing the binary worked.
Sorry, assumptions get the better of me. Worked fine hashing the binary.

Have fun. Eligius is a pretty good pool, they accept all kinds of wacky transactions!

You don't execute flash objects though, they're just archives of scripts and assets to help the player generate the content (Which, is the thing that's being executed).
Don't get me wrong, I agree with you, but, that's invalid.

Or you could do [IP transactions]( but, for the same reason as why DNS is a shitty idea, this is.
Neither can actually verify that the owner of the site is the person replying (I.E. man-in-the-middle).
Pro-tip:- DNS has:-
1. No verification it's not been tampered with (I.E. Signature)
2. Is public for the world to see (I.E. no encryption)

I was talking more about the dude asking if he had a wire, if I'm honest.

It's just a text box with a "submit" button normally, you put your rawtransaction data in the box, hit submit, and, it tells you if they accepted it or not, if they did, it's then propagated as if eligius was the source, so, even if no peers accept it, eligius still has it in their mempool and will mine it on the next block (assuming it fits the normal requirements, high enough priority, not invalid, etc...)

You really want to know? Because nobody wants to really spend their coins. They're a pain to get, logically they *might* go up (Limited cap of coins), etc...
Once you have some, you don't really want to spend them. At-least, I don't, and, the people I know don't. My friend paid me $10 for something, literally a month later it equated to him paying me $100 (Jumped from like $13 per to $130 per), needless to say, he's not really spent many bitcoins after that.

As someone who feels like they understand the bitcoin network adequately, including fees, I'd still shit my pants transferring $113,706,000 via bitcoins, simple because if I fuck up, I know it's literally gone for good, and, I feel that's what is saying. It's not that we don't understand it, it's more that $113,706,000 is way too fucking much to risk even if we're 110% sure we've set everything up correctly, confirmed the raw transaction that's signed before broadcasting, triple checked the output address, triple check we're not including a 1,800BTC miner fee or some bullshit, I start to doubt myself when I'm in the $10k range, double checking everything, at 10,000 times that amount, I'd be shaking in real life, sweating, begging out loud that I hadn't of fucked something up.
