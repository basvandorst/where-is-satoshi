That's how regulations work.

Any company that tried to do an end around public finance laws and regulations by basically replacing a regulated IPO with an unregulated ICO is going to get its attempt shut down immediately and then become the poster boy for anti-cryptos to point to in order to justify the government needing to regulate and control cryptos.

My friend said the same thing at the horse racing track.

[I wonder where JPM got this idea from...](

It's precisely BECAUSE you don't know if the plaintiff would have sold at the peak that they should receive bitcoins or cash in the equivalent amount because its the defendants fault we don't know and the plaintiff lost the opportunity to control their property, so it should be construed in the most favorable terms for the plaintiff, since the defendant unlawfully took that opportunity from the plaintiff. 
When the defendant is the reason the plaintiff lost the opportunity to control and capitalize on their investment, it will be construed to give the plaintiff the best possible outcome of that investment so as not to reward that benefit to the bad acting defendant and to discourage this type of wrongful conversion of property.

You are right, you don't understand the analogy.

You can't explain that

It's no different than gold, or any other inherently worthless commodity that is only given its inflated inherent value by social construct or entrenched opinion.

You mean thousands of inherently worthless pieces of paper or nothing?
Its turtles all the way down.

Its no different than gold in the ways that I elaborated on.
The element of time only changes the credibility or ease of acceptance of the value the society gives the inherently worthless commodity, whether it be gold or bitcoin.
As a result, gold is only more stable because the perception of it being stable is more solidified and widely accepted from the passage of time that is has been inherently worthless yet consistently valued above that.
Conclude what you will from the similarities, and the effect time has on the perception of both of their contrived values.

If Bitcoin were simple enough that regular folks could access it easily without the need of an exchange, or losing their bitcoin ownership to an exchange when using an exchange, Bitcoin would have avoided these problems inherent to Bitcoin that exchanges try to solve, with disastrous results and crashes.

Mine is split up in a similar fashion. I have one part in a diary, one part on a ring, another in a locket, another in a cup, one in a diadem and finally inside the the belly of my pet snake. Its almost a riddle.
