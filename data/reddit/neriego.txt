That's the moment to buuuuy more

And I forgot to tell you. Not every country has taxes on Bitcoin, so what you are saying is wrong.

That's what a lot of people do. Like me haha. Saving in btc
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:52:01
That's what I'm talking about. The same money that we saved before but now a looooooot of people are saving in btc.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:04:03
And one last thing, I hope that btc can change the money transactions
In case that btc fails I have XRP too haha

We are not living with all the paycheck. We are saving in a better way

Why deal? and why with you? i have fundaments to say what i said.
Give your fundaments to keep believen in BTC/BCH/ETH?

90% of people are speculating with Bitcoin. When I get my salary (last day of each month) I have money to save, I choose to save it in Bitcoin. Before it was in dollars now I trust in btc :D. So I guess that a Lot of people are doing the same.

11-21-17. I was using ripio to hold my btc and poloniex to hold the eth.

Thanks for the info man! it looks like we have less congestion now :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:03:09
I dont have a car, in Argentina I don't need it haha. In case I have one I have money left in the salary to repair it. Btc it's there just to hodl.
Aaaand I have 1 rule. 
1) if I make millions with btc GREAT if I lose all the saving too bad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:58:32
I have a problem with my transaction, someone can help me unstuck this? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:52:40
Depends on the country and the way they pay you. Soooo my friend....
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:03:57
I'm using block chain wallet for my btc and eth. I just checked the btc address and it doesn't start with 3. But in the segwit list you can see block chain .info in green. 
Soooo??? :P
