Agreed, hit report. OP is spammin' hard.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:40:59
Yes, and OP is spamming these sketchy domains hardcore over the last couple of days.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:50:03
Were you come for subreddit to meme harder
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:10
Or, $16k, now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:30
And 18500 now, 3 minutes from your post. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:01:14
That's a little nitpicky. Surely a new set of keys would be around the same or less than your deductible, anyway?

True investing fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:50:47
It's not "lazy" to acknowledge that nobody can analyze what will happen in the future with any certainty. If you believe an asset or investment will appreciate, you are speculating. It's not necessarily bad to speculate, just know what it is and that you are doing it.

It's a literal ad for some dumbass promising guaranteed returns, with contact info and all.
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:02:22
I SEENT IT

Are you barefoot?
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:53:08
I don't think it's for himself...
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:12:32
If you own a few and sell a small fraction, are you not still HODLin'?
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:21:37
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:39:03
I think it's an unreasonable "gotcha" to require action to retain funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:13
THAT IS JOKE
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:36:12
What, because he says he's happy to pay taxes on the realization?
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:12:13
There is no shame in locking in the profit by selling for what you're in for on a meteoric rise. I call this HODL and HEGDE
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:27
Yeah, but the sheer swings that were executing were crazy to see. You would figure there would be a lot more to eat through than to execute all the way down at 9200
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:37:37
I meant someone being careless with their own details on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:47:42
Yeah, but right now, he could take a fraction and vastly improve their position. He'll still be good when that day comes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:22:41
I think you are reading too much into one man's moon. That's all it is. He even says he'll be buying back in, but it makes sense for *him* to realize gains now. I agree with the power and threat of control that Bitcoin represents, though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:28:45
I responded to the lawsuit but never heard anything more... I lost 3 BTC, IIRC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:10
This shit is nuts! 9250 swinging to 9800 in seconds!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:40:11
All it takes is a PI spotting a post on that you thought couldn't be connected to you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:15:04
Why would Uncle Sam care if we hodl or sell now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:41:39
Mt Gox?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:55
I think they mean # of trade orders.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:25
You sold because you worry the platform isn't reliable, or you sold by mistake? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:52:25
He's from somewhere cheaper. There are lots of cheaper, and more expensive places. With this amount of money, I would move for geographic arbitrage, wouldn't you? 
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:20:34
There's no fucking pattern.
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:51:00
Also very different from clowns, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:46:29
Or at all, like I suspect is the case for the guy suggesting he's asexual.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:01:05
To some people, marriage = sex, and not much else. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:48:20
Your typo game is strong. Tell me more about finacne!

This cartoon is trash lol
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:49:48
They are messing with you.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:12:44
I missed the deadline to claim my losses as a creditor, and the site to submit a claim was broken for a long while; do I have any other recourse?
@_date: 2019-05-04 03:38:08
Defiantly indeed
