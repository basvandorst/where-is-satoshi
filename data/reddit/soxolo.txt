This was declared the case in early 2014.

To be fair being treated as CG is better than the IT regime route - This is actually beneficial as CG rates are lower and therefore less monies are owed on disposal if a sizeable gain is made.
As for the taxman, it will want its cut from any source of income it can, VAT (consumerism tax) and IHT (death tax) are prime examples.  As the money funds public service I think it’s balanced and there are arguments on both sides. 
With crypto a tax on wealth is (imho) a lot more likely given it is deflationary.

Inside the store, my options were either show the store or the atm. I thought this is better for advertisement, at least people would know where to go.

I used to work for FOS a few years back.
I believe CB must be FCA regulated so all you will need is a final response letter from them to instigate ADR.
If you don’t have this FOS will write out to them and provide them 8 weeks to give you a response, if no response is given FOS can take it up. They need to be sure CB has had the 8 weeks set out in legislation before they can get involved.
That’s the general rule for taking complaints to FOS, not sure if CB has exceptions for some odd and niche reason - I used to adjudicate between top 10 banks and their customers and only about 10% of my cases fell outside of this category.
There are time limits - if you wait to long for example either from receiving a response or from when the error occurred. Don’t put it off - do it sooner rather than later.
Also, you can fill out a complaint form online:  - be clear and coherent in your complaint - they review what you say and don’t ask much more (I.e. it’s up to you to make your own case!)
Responses take 90 days under ADR if I’m not mistaken, can take longer.
When you receive a response from FOS you can challenge it and have it escalated up to review by an ombudsman. Firstly it will be reviewed by an investigator, then another investigator.
