Welcome to the world of bitcoin...?

Ham.sk, which is a website where you can order food online, accepts bitcoin payments. It's not somehow shown on the main page, but if you order something from restaurant that accept online payments, there's also a bitcoin. It's availible only in Slovakia - Bratislava and Kosice only, so if you guys are from here or will visit in future, check it out. Webpage is unfortunatly not translated to english, but google translate will do the job.

Dollas, dollas... FIAT is basically a shitpaper, but nothing is better for lending.

Just keep the private keys somewhere safe and you are ok. Law enforcement forces won't be looking for some random numbers and words in your pocket notebook.

Maybe bitcoin.org should change Instant peer-to-peer transactions to Next-week transactions and Zero or low processing fees to Same as your bank fees or your tx is stucked forever.

Do you even math?

That forum must be full of 80+ guys who are still using Nokia 3410 and dial-up... what the hell? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:21:18
I hope so since I am lending some bucks there. But API for that is still working... let's hope for the best.

Legal is only a term created by government. And you know what they say, fuck the government.

Well, I have some shit in there....

No fukin idea, this one is from bitfinex to kraken, looks like exchanges are getting out of bussiness or we leveled up to "pay like hell or get no confirms".

I hope for that, waiting for few hours... nope. I just hope it will be before 1+2 relase so I can test it.
