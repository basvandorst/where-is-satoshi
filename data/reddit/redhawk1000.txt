I wish I thought of this! I love the simple layout of the website. Best of luck with it.

I don't understand the question, are you trying to buy bitcoin from a friend and he/she will deposit money into your bank account in the Philippines ?

So did you check your balance on blockchain between that time ?

This is the best method - just make sure you dont save any bitcoins and convert them directly to US dollars, and you would be saving on the credit card charges , bank charges etc.

Did you check on blockchain.info how much you had on the Multibit wallet anytime after 24th Nov 2013 and before the 6th Dec 2013 ?
I think you should contact Multibit about this and let them know, this is a serious issue.

Personally I love armory, but its direct more towards "power" users and we still need an offline wallet that is safe and secure for the casual bitcoin user. 
Can't wait for hardware bitcoin wallets that even the average Joe can use.

Exactly, I know a lot of young people in the UK that have a decent amount of bitcoin but cant really sell them for cash (without alerting their bank). If more online shops accept them in the UK that would give them an option.

I think it can go either way, most of the people that are "holding on" to their bitcoins are those that firmly believe their price will increase tremendously in the next 4-5 years. Many bitcoin holders will bail out and start spending these coins to buy stuff instead of getting cash. The main problem most people have (and I mean the average person that has limited computer skills) is that either they dont understand the concept of bitcoins or have no idea how to buy them. In the next few months we would probably see more user friendly websites.
Bitcoins will either be a huge hit or loss - anyone that wants to hold on to his/her bitcoins has taken the decision that he's willing to lose everything, but the vast majority of holders will sell if they stabilize at a certain value for an extended period of time. Im not too optimistic about other competitors (eg LTC, FTC etc.) and bitcoins seem less of a risk.

Good news, Eastern Europe and the "poorer" countries in Europe (Cyprus, Greece etc.) will benefit the most from the use of bitcoin. 
I also think that South America and the Middle East will be huge for the bitcoin market when we see a better infrastructure.
