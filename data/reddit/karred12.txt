I was able to follow the instructions and verify that my seed does indeed work. You really need to use this version, as the original  does not work (atleast for me). 
Remember to practice couple of times with the online version (translated using Google), before you move it to the offline machine. As you will not be able to read or understand anything once you are on the offline machine. You would be able to figure out most of the stuff based on location, the only challenge will be locating the "Bitcoin main net", which should be the 5th item on the dropdown list (from the top). 
I hope that helps.

Well a simple proposal is the bank partners with an Exchange to enable remittances.
For example a person in US needs to send money to family members in  Hondorus. They can transfer the funds to the Banks Bitcoin address. Once the transaction is confirmed with 6 confirmations (in 1 hour), his relatives should be able to walk into any of the bank locations and withdraw the money. 
The bank would charge a fee for this service, however due to the lack of intermediaries, the fee will still be lower than Western Union or other options.

Site where you can use the Trezor seed and passphrase to generate addresses and private keys.
Use only on OFFLINE machine. 
1. Check the "English Phrase" box on the right side just below  button
2. Delete the phrase that shows up and paste in your Trezor phrase.
3. Scroll down to the dropdown box that says "Outward account (Master)" and click it, and choose "Custom"
4. in the box that says "m/i" in greyed out text, type in m/44'/0'/0'/0/0 and you will have your first receiving address of your first account.
5. m/44'/0'/0'/0/1 is second address of first account. m/44'/0'/0'/1/0 is first CHANGE address of first account. m/44'/0'/1'/0/0 is first address of second account. etc. etc.
6. so in short m/44'/0'/[A]'/[C]/[K] where A is your account number starting with 0, C is change address (yes=1, no=0), and K is Bitcoin address counting from 0.

For a small amount such as $5, the only way you can send it across the ocean is using Bitcoin. Other options like, Xoom would charge 4.99$ in fees, just for the transaction. The Western Union fees would be similar as well.
Even with Bitcoin there are small fees charged by exchanges (for converting to local currency), however these should be relatively small 1% to 3%.

As long as you can limited the amount per transactions. It should be okay. My understanding is that there is a limit of 1500$ per transactions per person, beyond which you should report to the goverment etc.. (that is the reason Bitcoin ATM's have daily transaction limits).
If you are selling smaller Bitcoin gift cards for 50$ etc...., you should be okay.

Agreed, merchants that use BitPay/Coinbase are helping spread adoption.

If you are using Paper wallets, you could paper wallets with different denominations. So, that you do not need to bring everything online to cash out.
If you are using Armory or Electrum(Offline), you can have multiple addresses in one wallet and do not need to really split the wallets.

I just sent a test transaction using 10$ worth of Bitcoin. 
The system works Great !!!
I don't know how you do it, but your current rate is better than every other competitor out there. 
Just 2 enhancement requests:
a) If you could have a way to save frequently used contacts and their address and payment information that would be very helpful. As most people typically send money to the same persons every month. 
e.g., I have saved a contact called "Joe". To send money to Joe next time, I just pick Joe instead of having to type everything again. 
For privacy reasons , you can't view the account number, but it will be stored in the database and you can send money to your contacts next time. 
b) This is regarding the payment. After you send the Bitcoin. The timer still keeps counting. 
It would be best you could add a message saying - payments require x confirmations and will confirm in 10 to 30 minutes or something like that. That way users don't panic, when they see the transaction pending for some time.

c) History is replete with examples of a certain ethnic group or political activists being persecuted. These people need to sell all their assets and convert them into cash or gold and flee across the border. At the border there are checkpoints, where they can get searched and be robbed. 
Imagine a technology where, someone can convert their entire wealth into a digital currency and the only place where it is stored is in their brain('brain wallet'). How useful would that be to the victims/refugees in such circumstances.

This is a protocol built on top of Bitcoin. (Just like HTTP built on top of TCP etc...). 
While the base layer of Bitcoin Protocol, lets you send Bitcoins. The counterparty layer on top adds additional functionality for trading financial assets and instruments.
There is a distributed exchange built into the protocol, where you can trade Bitcoin for XCP, Stocks etc... 
There is also an inbuilt betting platform, where you can make bets on events like - Superbowl outcome, price of Bitcoin in 2015 etc... All this is done in a distributed fashion without the need for a central party.

Thank you for doing this, this is a great piece of software. However, you really need to change the theme of website to something more serious. 
People need to trust the website before they can deposit money(Bitcoins) into the software.

Counterparty is a community created protocol, which allows anyone to make and use decentralized financial assets that utilize the bitcoin protocol as a transport layer in order to provide the following functionalities:
- Distributed exchange
- Financial derivatives
- User created assets
- Dividends 
- Betting
Counterparty differs from projects that hope to eventually offer a similar functionality because:
- Fully functioning - live platform.
- No IPO -  Counterparty is a currency, not a corporation.
- No funding - Donation driven.
- No corporate ties -  Free from outside influences.
- No fees - Free to use.
- No hype - The technology speaks for itself.
- Anonymous creators - Focus is on the protocol.
- Fair initial distribution - Risk and opportunity were shared equally.
- Development speed - Created from scratch in about a month.
- Open source - Anyone can add additional functionality.

Wow, nice app.
a) How do you handle variations in user typing in the price. 
50PHP or 50PhP or 50 PHP
b) How long does the confirmation txt message take. (10 minutes might be too slow for inperson transactions)

Nice job on the hardware wallet.
Can you provide further details on the software/install process required. a) Does it work on Windows b) does it require installation of any driver software c) At this point do you need to compile software source code to make it work (I am not a developer).

The Trezor will flash a warning message during boot-up. If the firmware is not signed by Satoshi labs.

It takes a week to ten days for the coins to get to your coinbase account. Check for the history in the 'Transactions page' it will show if the transaction has been completed. 
If you still can't figure it out contact coinbase support.

You could probably use the inbuilt betting feature of the counterparty protocol to make bets and predictions (on top of the bitcoin blockchain).
There has already been a proof of concept of 'Super bowl' bets on this platform.

Currenlty it is only compatible with their webbased clients. However, developments to Electrum, Armory, Multibit are on the way (within 1 to 2 months).

It is possible, the low liquidity gives large players the opportunity to manipulate the market. However, for high frequency trading to work, they need to build and popularize an exchange that can handle that kind of load and volume. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:35:31
Good idea on the investigation. However, the hard part is "infecting" the image, without messing out other programs. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:36:14
Yes, this is just hype. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:44:35
There are 3 possiblities.
a) We consolidate here at around 1000$ (800 to 1200$)
b) Price rockets to 2-3k and then crashes to a much lower level
c) We could see a dip of the price from todays levels. Till the market catches upto it in 4 to 6 months. 
It is hard to say which one of these scenarios would play out. So, I would say invest only what you are willing to loose. By investing only a portion, you have some upside at the same time you do not loose everything if it crashes.

Till we have a world that runs entirely by bitcoin. For practical purposes, we also have exchange fees. 
e.g, 1% fees to convert USD to Bitcoin
       3% fees to convert bitcoin to pesos or whatever currency using localbitcoin. 
Till we have exchanges all over the world, it is going to be the same cost as other remittance services.

I remember seeing an exchange in India. But unfortunately, it is run by an individual(instead of automated) and the commission is 3%. 
For now the only alternative is local bitcoin, which has a huge buy/ask spread.

I have found that the WebShield feature of Avast interferes with Electrum connection (you can probably turn the webshield temporarily off or create an exception). Other antivirus or firewall might be blocking the connection as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:40:56
To buy put or call options, you need to surrender your money to the exchange and hold it there for a long time (e.g., six months). Given the fact that a number of exchanges/online wallets have shutdown, this is risky.
