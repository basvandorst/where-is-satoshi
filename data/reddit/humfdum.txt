One of my first transactions on coinbase was for $80 bucks in 2016. Sold a few months later and made $20. looking back I wish I would of let it just sit there. Don't let boredom make a day trader out of you. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:03:32
Could you give me some context to what this means? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:09:22
Gotcha thanks
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:04
Yes people here have a cognitive bias like i've never seen before. Good choice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:33:06
I wish someone would actually explain why this guy is wrong instead of just saying he is.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:51:06
I'd love a designated place for those to go.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:41:05
Should we support it or is this sarcasm I guess is my only question. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:12:51
What if I dont care if the confirmation is fast? Since I am just hodling
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:01
The fee would be $23. Would it become available in 1-4 hours or days? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:54:06
Damn dude maybe no one told him yet. Chill
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:16:27
Oh I get it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:08:14
I believe I lost the 12 words in my move. Would I also need that? Thanks for your reply.

There will always be someone to loan you something when you have to pay them back with Interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:07
when* not if. show us that ass
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:14:08
Jesus dude
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:15:50
Good luck man!
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:35:39
What price did you get in at?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:18:01
Not that soon. This is big to us but unknown to most of the world.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:59:33
Sounds like you still haven't learned your lesson. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:01
8 years is not a long time for a new global currency to take effect. Think dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:16:08
Oh shit. Okay thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:39
1k, 1 transaction, 500 sat / B. I understand better now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:01
 I just read that there doesn't need to be someone on the other side. 
How sure are you 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:29:35
Thanks for the help. Do I also need my pc to be synced with the blockchain? Im thinking I might have the Wallet.dat on my old time machine.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:44
Do you pay a network fee (maybe another fee) each time you swipe at say the grocery store. And does that fee come out automatically? Or is it literally just spending Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:28
Do it. -Elon
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:26
If it comes in 3 hours its fine. 500 sat / B seems crazy. I understand what a confirmation is now more I think. I get a confirmation each time a new block has be set correct?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:04
Dont act like that.
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:02:15
:/ sigh
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:43:49
A lot of young people with no experience took a liking to bitcoin long before the bubble. Not all of us bought at the $300 price. We made the mistake of waiting for mainstream hype to buy in. 
90% is high but I don't think he was being literal. It is a large number. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:41:19
I frequent this sub reddit and i'd say 75% of the time I have no clue what the acronyms being used mean. Even after a few days theres a ton to catch up on. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:19:56
Oh jeez
@_date: 2019-02-23 22:26:22
This sub is a hair trigger for thinking the next bull run is here. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:10:39
Oh so it's probably an issue with them? Sweet
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:40:07
Are you able to check the code with aptoid apk?
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:41:45
I don't understand why staying informed would be a waste of time. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 01:56:00
Not much else I can do while taking a poo.
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:56:58
I have a bookmark at $17250.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:35:39
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:33:12
I did end up fixing it shortly after I posted this, I don't remember how unfortunatly. I believe it was an issue on there side. Or I kept fucking around with it.
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:35:26
I don't understand why this community pulls out the rocket ship memes every time we see a generous price raise.
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:24:07
You guys are so silly here.
