You are right, I was referring to bitcoin.com.

Sorry to ask, I understand that you can trace every transaction, but how can anyone link an address to a person? Since every wallet can even use a different random generated address every time? I read few times that this doesn’t matter and still can be traced, but I am not sure I understand how.
And the benefit for this kind of international transfers is unbelievably valuable to many people (including me) where every single transaction has to be supported by documents and then given a period to be reviewed, then another 5-7 days to be received, and in few times it didn’t reach, what’s the action from the bank side? Started an investigation that takes up to 30 days! And trust me they will use every day of those 30!
However unfortunately till now I am not able to use that, the other day we were thinking seriously of doing that between company branches in different countries, unfortunately we couldn’t because the price is changing dramatically, and that on both side we need it to be in fiat. And that’s a lot of work for the amount we were sending.
Yeah I am in for anything that helps me getting the banks out of my life.

Tbh, I would agree with you if they didn’t use btc.com as a name clearly trying to trick people thinking they are buying BTC (even their subreddit, Twitter handle and all this shit) while they are actually selling them BCH. And this what baffles me about this whole BCH none sense, call your self bitcoin cash, and explain to everyone that you are the way bitcoin was planned to be -if they think so- but stop trying to trick people into believing that they are buying btc.

Was the concept of block chain / bitcoin totally brand new when Satoshi introduced it in his white paper? Or was there some earlier attempts using the idea of public ledger and complicated math for verification?

Beginner  questions:
1- As I understand mining a block takes roughly 10 minutes, yet when I do a transaction, I get confirmations in couple of seconds and It’s safe to spend it. How is that possible?
2- I understand (I guess) the aspect of public ledger, but what stops a node from including a false transaction (from A to B) and  getting lucky by solving that block before the others, wouldn’t this get actually broadcasted to other nodes as solved block and registered in blockchain even if it had false data? Or does transactions gets broadcasted to all nodes (before solving the block) as shared memory pool, so they “vote” on the validity of the content too?
3- I read that we can generate wallet keys offline, isn’t it possible that 2 wallets might end up with the same random keys?

Genuine question: I’ve been following bitcoin news for almost a year now, so far It looks like it’s quite rare when people were able to justify prices going up or down, not even in a hindsight, very few times (I can think of one only actually) that people were able to link an event to price movement, and yet most of the time it was debatable.
With that said, the fact that we aren’t able to explain events that already happened and all, how on earth people talk about predictions, and expect anyone to take it seriously?

Where is this originals from?

Tbh I never got this, don’t get me wrong I believe in bitcoin big time, but was never able to brush this off, that governments would let this slide without figuring out who was behind what might actually topple the financial system, sure Satoshi is master of security and all, but I just can’t believe this image of a mysterious genius that made something THAT big and disappeared.. and everyone let it slide.

Never saw one, regardless if the leap is up or down, even in a hindsight, no one has a proper answer.
The only thing I believe in, is BTC is an answer to many of our problems, and that people eventually will understand that, and that’s why I invest in it.

Sorry I am relatively new, could you elaborate on this? So something like BCH history will be bigger? Or smaller than BTC to download?
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:10:52
You.. I like you!

Tbh I don’t think the countless others are trying all the time to trick people into buying theirs by sneaking in as being btc , and spending money on that and only that part, pretending that they are something else. heck even their subreddit is called r/btc not r/bch or something. 
I am not really interested in any of those fights and not a long time crypto guy, but it’s really really lame, and this roger ver dude is really scammy in every detail of his personality and moves. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 08:39:47
Every now and then I read that Bitcoin isn’t anonymous , I don’t get how? So yes I had to register to purchase some btc, then I moved that out of exchange to some wallet (that doesn’t require ID) then to hardware wallet.. etc. I understand that these addresses can even be used once only (meaning you can’t even trace in-out knowing it’s the same wallet considering that the address is generated every time)
What am I missing? How this can be linked to people or even knowing who is who?
