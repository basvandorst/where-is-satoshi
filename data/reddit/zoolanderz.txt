coinbase sucks 
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:46:43
i had a fraudulent charge on my account that put me in the negative. I have no problem managing my account but not when unauthorized charges occur. I just got the fraudulent charges taken care of and then I get cited for 70 dollars in overdraft fees.
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:15:18
yeah you would have to open an offshore account or just slowly cash out. Maybe use friends to help disperse it. You have found yourself in a mighty fine position haha
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:21:59
you can try sending a few to 17H9UaBo8cnmQcb8YrU3Y6V3kj55GbRAnt   I will let you know if they're real :)

add a higher fee...?
@_date: 2016-01-22 00:01:49
pretty smart
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:19:49
just use a CC/debit card through coinbase.com or circle.com

@_date: 2017-01-13 05:23:26
if you have logged in the past 3 days you would have seen it..
@_date: 2017-08-29 01:01:48
Correct. They need the funds sourced. The only way I could get "clean" money was by transferring the wealth back and forth. Stupid
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:22:10
it was in the dashboard when you logged in for the past 3 days
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:26:53

my bank wouldnt accept the funds. had to cash some out, write a check to a family member, and then have the family member write a check back.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:45:39

@_date: 2016-11-17 19:55:49

@_date: 2016-11-10 18:47:37
i dont 
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:25:12
Its not gong to be instant. Most exchanges require at least 3 confirmations which could take 30 minutes.
@_date: 2016-11-07 17:28:55
@_date: 2016-12-06 05:12:41
yes. one is 750ish
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:16:46
i would first change the title. It's quite misleading. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 05:19:06
sadly, no . that is about 12 cents .
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:53:24

@_date: 2015-07-26 05:06:53

oh hey there gurlll
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:44:07
sweet story girl
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:37:43
and then you can pay for subscriptions. 15 dollars per month but you get money for listening which could adequate to more than 15 dollars per month. Sometimes you would even have that person that paid for the subscription that never listened(wasting there 15 dollars and the company benefiting)  Someone go run with that idea please
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:46:53
lets put it this way... you will never be reach from that $100 dollar investment 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:27:48
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:32:11

@_date: 2017-10-08 23:41:03
i can send for less than .50 cents
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:40:53
isnt true.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:37:57
how is that even possible? that's 5x the market cap of BTC
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:30:47
re add your debit card. happened to me and i just readded my card
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:00:14
"feed" he says
@_date: 2015-09-15 14:00:57
I think he means "drugs". Look at his recent posts. Many references to bongs and weed.
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:49:39
re add your debit card. it will be instant 
@_date: 2016-10-05 00:28:19

@_date: 2016-05-24 20:20:04

@_date: 2016-05-23 05:02:39
its not true. i just talked to a supervisor in marketing
@_date: 2016-07-07 20:28:13
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:54:57
this all makes sense. I remember Cumberland mining bought a nice chunk of coins in the FBI sale.
