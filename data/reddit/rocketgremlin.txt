It's not really optional if the blocks are kept artificially small to encourage LN adoption. Segwit itself was a block size increase dependant on adoption of segwit transactions. Even with LN the block size must be increased so why we can't do that now ? 
I am not opposed to lightning but its always offered as an option that will be ready some day. But right now I am forced to use other options to make purchases.

You are right, I misunderstood how the network would operate.

It's the result of the lack of ownership of bitcoin or the trademark. Anyone has the right to fork the chain and pronounce themselves bitcoin. But satoshi relinquished all rights to the public, and this is the result.

wow, just wow.

Well they are in the process of adding more alts, which people are using to avoid high fees. The question is not will coinbase survive but whether bitcoin will remain the king.

It really depends on how you view the scaling debate. Big blocks are cheap but you do need to sacrifice some lower end nodes. LN will help but its not here yet and people are being forced else where to transact.

Only because the current fee price is to damn high. There would be no need to use lightning if the fees where reasonable. Lightning is supposed to be optional not mandatory.

I wouldn't say you where stupid, just ill prepared to speculate on currency futures. Speculating is stressful especially if you cant afford to absorb the losses in full.

You were thinking you wanted your purchases and they where worth that price at the time. The only mistake if you want to call it one is not buying a few for speculation. However you probably would of cashed in years ago or maybe have got goxed. Hindsights 20/20 don't worry abouti.

Its nothing to do with open source, many open source projects trademark their name. Red hat 7 is an easy example of this behaviour. The problem is satoshi owns the name but to trademark it he would have had to surrender his anonymity.

They should not have to build the code to use segwit when segwit has been planned for years. Core should of had this sorted out well in advance of activating segwit.

Lightning is not going to solve anything if people move elsewhere before its released. Lightning is bet that in some time in the future its secure and ready for public use. But it does not solve the issues now that people are moving else where to transact online. ~~It also requires trust in a system that was designed to be trustless.~~
