Maybe that’s his payday? Chill

HODLers remember. I don’t even check the price every day, my roommate does and will tell me but he’s a new investor so he don’t know any better

Banks telling me how to spend my money, and they wonder why bitcoin is taking off
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:25:51
Seriously now we’re discussing the price DROPPING to $12,000! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:19:33
But but doge coin

Oh yes I'm not pushing him. He asked me about it because we'd talked about it before so I don't understand how he has done no independent research on it.

I have a friend who keeps wanting to get into bitcoin he says. I showed him how much it's gone up and he still says it's too expensive 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:30:39
Hmm we'll see by the end of the day?

Once the amount I hold reaches an amount of American dollars I plan to withdraw my bitcoin, pay off my debts, and never join a bank again
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:58:30
Meh maybe not. I️ have a bank right now, I️ should’ve meant loans
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:42:08
Amazing what we get accustomed to huh?

My game is also not based on what they’re basing it on. I basically want a specific amount of money and when what I own hits thag amount, adios guys!
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:23:02
No it’s gonna be more like “But aren’t bitcoins expensive? Also like what are they, what is a bitcoin?”
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:01:48
What platform are you trading so frequently? Fees feel like they’d hurt by that point
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:00:33
I got in at $600 per, no regrets now! But boy did I have regrets then. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:35:34
Well the important thing is you tried.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:12:58
Haven't laughed so hard in awhile.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:21:41
Hey I'm kind of fresh but what's a good alternative to Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:12:44
Amazing 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:19:47
Same here, not to compare stashes but I sold half a bitcoin back at $400 and I don't like to think about it. Small change but I'm a poor guy
