Perfect reason to get into it. Since it is rigged the price is extremely suppressed, and it is cheap. Gold should be at around $8,000 give or take a few hundred. Of course this can be debated, however when it is exposed or the dollar crashes it's value will increase substantially. 
I own silver, gold &amp; bitcoin. Always good to diversify your portfolio.

Buy Reddcoins,  download their wallet. Transfer your coins to them. Stake them to make 5% interest a year. Sell later for profit.
They are cheap now. And don't day trade them or you will get burned by greedy whales.

You can also store Bitcoins at  and gain interest on the USD value of your deposit, without taking a loss.

You need to look at the big picture. See we can easily roll over our own debt. We can't force foreign countries to do the same. Our debt is basically a giant pyramid scheme we control. Foreign debt is a giant pyramid scheme we DON'T control. So when I say most of our debt is foreign owned, I mean if these countries decide not to continue buying treasuries, we are fucked. We are fucked anyways the moment they raise interest rates, but that's another subject.

 just opened their doors. They pay interest based on the USD value of your deposit in Bitcoin. You can choose between different lengths. And they are building a gold reserve.

You clearly don't see how this is good for bitcoin. And try getting a response from those companies you mentioned. Their service is horrible.
Peter has a huge following. All good for bitcoin.

It's a startup. Growing pains are always part of a new business. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:22:43
Isn't that a drug haha

I live in Seattle and have already approached many of the shops up here about it for my Bitcoin business. Most likely won't happen anytime soon. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:07:32
Did anyone email them to know the start up fee? Also illegal in the US?
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:53:14
No but my first purchase in a long while. Just seemed to invigorate me more. With the drop in price recently I lost sight of the technology over the loss. Just my way of continuing support.
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:41:08
Yes there are 4 different options.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:26:56
Failed arguments get down votes I guess.

 allows you to deposit your bitcoins for interest, however it is only for the USD value of your deposit that gets the interest. Good way to hedge against BTC as well. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 02:42:52
If I want to try and hedge losses or just have extra money this is a great website. Plus you always make a return.
Way better than an actual bank savings account.

Nice work dude! What you may already know is you are educating the next generation to accept something out of a central control. It will become adopted faster and out in the mainstream. I wouldn't be surprised to see a band or something making songs about it. 
Keep it up!

I did a search for it in the On demand menu. I don't think it was in the Just In movie section. 
It was $5.99 for HD or $4.99 for old school.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:09:51
Thanks for the link. This would be a better site to get info on this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-10 21:04:12
I hope it works out and increases awareness in Bitcoin. Expect to get a lot of trolls screaming scam and fraud. Ignore it, and run an ethical business and the free market will decide. That's why it's called risk.
As long as it involves Bitcoin, and it is spreading the word, that's a good thing.
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:16:17
Spend it and buy more. That will do more for BTC and much faster.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:29:21
Awesome thanks for the info!

If Euro Banks fail, so will the dollar. We are at the point of currency interconnection. Don't forget who owns most of our debt. China, Japan, Europe.
No money equals no debt buy cycle.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:43:02
I will try both the above mentioned. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:26:17
It is inflating our prices. Almost all products have gone up in price. It is not inflating as fast as you think because we are exporting all of our inflation when we buy goods overseas. It will catch up to us once other countries start sending our money back, then you will really see the inflation kick in. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:11:07
Good to know thanks! Curious to know if anyone has done well in these?
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:29:00
Great reply thank you! This actually helps a lot. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:39:00
Sent you a PM. Thanks!

I have made so much money off Quark it is stupid. Of all my cryptocurrencies I own (About 12 of them) this is my most favorable. It is also the one I expect to make me the most in the long term due to the recent news of China adding it to their exchange.
And anyone not following an economist (Bill Still) who has thousands of subscribers isn't too bright. Wrong or Right, people will buy due to his recommendation. Easy money.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:49:26
Uh...tell your friends to make an account on  and transfer BTC to it. Then play the other crypto markets. With an investment of even $100 they can be rich.
I would recommend Quarks, since they have been recently added to the China exchanges and are fairly new. It has seen a 500% increase so far this week and I expect it to hit the $1 mark in a few weeks. This would be a 5000% increase from this weeks lows.
There are many other great ones, and I own many of them, but this one has the best return thus far.
