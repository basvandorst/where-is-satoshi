Got my lifetime license just in time. Been thinking about it for years and decided to buy it just before 2.0 hit. Glad I did now that they do $25 a year

Can someone ELI5 the coin control? I did some research of it but don't fully grasp what it does and how it makes it mor anonymous

I had an old Capital One 360 account that I made for free years ago so I just transfer money from my main account into that account and then from that account to gemini. Takes a bit since I have to wait for transfers to clear each step along the way but at least I'm not paying $50 wire transfer fee.

IIRC, they only refund up to a certain amount though. My bank charged more than Gemini was going to refund.

Yeah this annoys me about all alternative sites to get btc from and people who tell you to use them. A lot require US residents to use Wire transfer which my bank charges $40 for. If I'm wanting $100 in bitcoin, why the fuck would I want to pay a 40% fee? Unless I'm going to be exchanging like $500+, I don't see it being a good option.

IIRC, the average US citizen makes 1.8 million during their entire life. "Not a lot. Just $1 million" fuck off.

Email them. They accepted my Internet bill after I told them my only Utility bill (electric) was in my dads name.

Email them. I did and was able to supply my internet bill (even though it says they don't allow it) for verification since my electric is in my dads name (I rent his condo and we just left it in his name since he gets a discount) and that's the only utility bill I have. Do you have any bills in your name?
@_date: 2017-01-01 04:19:28
It did! Just shoot them an email and they will sort you out.

My issue with Gemini is the only utility bill I have isn't in my name. So, therefore, I cannot open an account :/
@_date: 2016-12-18 21:38:37
Awesome. I'll give that a shot. Thanks!

How does that explain how coinstar is implementing it?

And humans are emotional beings. It's not that hard to see why some people would sell. Especially if $1000 is considered a lot for them. I understand you shouldn't invest what you aren't willing to lose but even if you can lose it, losing a grand can still hurt and it makes sense to try and minimize that loss.

It's easy to panic sell when it looks like its crashing with no hope of recovery. Sell quickly to minimize loss.

Right. If someone is coming to me asking about bitcoin, I'm not going to assume they know wtf the blockchain is. 98% of the population know little more than how to turn on the computer and browse social media. If they ask about something, respond as if they know absolutely nothing about the topic, especially when it comes to tech and computers.

I just deposited funds the other day. Nothing showed up in my account yet and today I go to check and get the message that they are closing. on my CO360 account, it says the payment went through. Really hope I am not out $200
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:37:55
Just glad I only have $200 owed to me because I have a feeling if he does eventually give refunds, it won't be for a good while longer.
