Thats a damn lie. Most people got into bitcoin to either buy lsd online or to get rich.

Hope the low prices holds until I get my paycheck

Most exchanges have 10k withdrawal daily limits

Lets see that shit drop. More profits.

This is the real story. One day a very smart man took a large shit.People started coming along and adding value to the shit. People reasoned that since money was just paper and had no real value anyways then they could make a piece of shit worth something as well. So on and on it went more and more people started buying shit from people selling their shit and slowly adding value to it, many smart people and many retarded fucks. The smart people were smart enough to realize that the shit although very expensive was still a pile of shit. The smart people profited off of this since the more demand for this shit there was the higher they could sell it for. The stupid people bought and bought and held since tales of riches surround this pile of shit. Many retarded people made a profit since they bought their shit before even more retarded people heard of the shit they were buying. And finally on the start of the holiday season the pile of shit made headlines, now everyone heard of this magical shit that has made many people rich. Everyone wanted to get a piece of that shit. But the smart people realized that the game was almost over since too many people had bought into the piece of shit and suddenly many people began paying a close eye on it and the smart people realized that soon everyone will realize that they ultimately just bought a piece of shit. So on the night before Christmas all the smart people swiftly sold their shit. And for a while people didn't panic,  their dreams of fortunes still strong, people celebrated the new year hoping and dreaming that their piece of shit will be worth more. But as the first month went on little by little the idiot started loosing faith, slowly most cut their losses, most feeling foolish and glum. Until the climactic end of the month where only the most stubborn are left (most have already realized that they wasted money on a piece of shit) clinging on to their shit because what choice do the have, hoping that people will stop calling it shit, hoping that people will buy into it again. But the smart people won't put their money in because they know the truth, in the end of the day a piece of shit is still a piece of shit.

You do understand that whenever you sell your bitcoin for fiat you are basically taking money from some sucker that "invested" at that price. Which is why most wall street guys won't touch it until it crashes. Money men love being at the top of the pyramid and most December investors are at the bottom of the pyramid holding the bags.

Yes child spread the FUD so we could all buy it at $1k
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:08:17
Based on the fact that we haven't had a bull run since December. Bitcoin has lost its steam for now. I expect the price to either drop or stay the same until some ground breaking news is announced.

Sell right now so you can buy back when it dips. These dips and rises are super profitable. Time to milk the hodlers dry!!!

I have an economics degree and I can tell you for a fact that all technical analysis are 100% bullshit.

God must really hate you.

There's no FUD just people slowly getting disillusioned. The normies getting in on bitcoin was what caused the insane price spike. Now that most of them lost their money they are slowly getting out.

I have my money on two different exchanges. I have 2 buy orders and two sell orders. I have one buy order at 6k and another one at 7k. I have one sell order at 8k and another one at 9k. My sell order today went through at 8k so when the price reaches 7k the buy order will go through. I've been doing that over and over and I've got about 1k more over and over again this volatile week. While mist idiots have been holding and making nothing

Not everyone becomes rich in a pyramid scheme idiot. If you think that we will all become rich if we work together then you have no fucking idea of how crypto actually works
