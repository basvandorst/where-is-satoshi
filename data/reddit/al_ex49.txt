I see a small correction coming, look at any crypto in the past (or any stock price for that matter). Whenever there's such a large exponential increase in value, it's almost always superseded by a dip in price. But after that's over, 10k in the coming year is more than likely at this point.

Maybe it is a fraction ;)

What’s the difference between r/btc and r/Bitcoin? Shouldn’t they be merged?

Thanks for the reminder! Time to check my MtGox account :)

I wasn't suggesting that you charge users for transactions to cold storage, but that your company would be losing out by paying more transaction fees. I see how it works now, thanks for clearing things up :)

Luckily I only lost about $300, but I can see others losing op to 3.5BTC

UPDATE: I finally managed to log into my Freewallet account and my funds seemed to be there (even though Blockchain.info says they were moved). I immediately made a Mycelium wallet account and backed up my private keys (as per zomgitsduke's suggestion) and sent my Bitcoin there. Here is the unconfirmed transaction: 
Is it possible that Freewallet has started to move everyone's funds to another address, but users still have access to their funds? If so, it seems like a very odd way of doing things as they will have to pay even more transaction fees...

Thanks, that's definitely what I'll be doing going forward.

Dude, provide a payment address. Rookie...

That seems logical, and I'm glad I didn't lose my funds. I just though it was really fishy that I couldn't log into my account and that the wallet associated with my account was emptied. I've been using the service for a while and funds were always stored in my wallet. If Freewallet had sent an email outlining the change, there wouldn't have been a problem.
