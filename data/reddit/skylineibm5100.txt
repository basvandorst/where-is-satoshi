Well, my research is to see what factors make people adopt Bitcoin, don't mind any bias attitude. But if put it on table, I do rather prefer people who are interested in Bitcoin, or gonna adopt it. since I want to know what drives them to use. A persons with strong negative opinion is understandable but it does not help this research, it might help to bring up different perspective. 
Thank you for raising your concern.
Yes, and that part I'm sorry I could not change the likert scale to 5, even though I strongly advocate my opinion to my professor advisories to have 5 likert scale. I've been force to comprise and follow the guideline. Apologies for unable to offer more middle-ground. 
But no worries, I'll try my best to prove them otherwise when in final defend report presentation.

Thank you for your valuable comment! I haven't encounter similar issue before, but thanks to you I got a new perspective, So for what I understand, you don't have to "trust" as long as you can get some form of benefit is that true? please correct me if I interpret your phrase wrongly. 
I have to admit here, the questions you see is base upon the Technology Adoption Model and the Innovation Diffusion Theory, where there it came from one of the "E-banking" adoption Journal. 
So, it might appear off for some respondent. 
Nevertheless, I appreciate your reply mate.
