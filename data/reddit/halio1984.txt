In general the people over at have a friendlier organization that a lot of people find fun to learn from...in additon with a much higher halving schedule it's a good way to test how the market is going to handle the halvings of BTC...

So this show's how well your investigative capabilities are becuase after the first time he was accused this BS he did up a blog post that walks through a number of security measures. The one that stood out to me (and lead me to trust him with my doge) was the fact that he has login scripts enabled on his systems that transfer their wallets off the machine before the user is allowed access..so even if the user log's into a system the wallet is gone...BTW why attack his security when MintPal just had 30% of Vericoins coins stolen? that seems like a big hot-wallet mess...
Also can we put the no one has seen him to bed...you realize that there is a video running around with his face all over it right? produced by individuals of the dogecoin community that tried to attack him as well....
It's sad really i would put money you are probably the same person launching the same attacks at him but since doge is tired of it you have to bother bit...

I have to counter that.  The top three merchant gateway's are coinbase, bitpay, and gocoin...I dont think gocoin including litecoin and dogecoin has hurt them in the least. 
You can argue that it hasn't helped them but you would be hard pressed to say it has hurt especially when the CEO almost always mentions all three in his comments.

I just want to point out that there is people building on the bitcoin blockchain who say confirmations take to long...the overstock CEO for one has made similar comments...

Why because someone hasn't heard of the next big thing? that's like saying alarm bells should be going off because you havn't heard of LG's new android phone...

maybe the first time but not the second...or third...and actually he only put about 1/3 someone else put up another 1/3 to match and the rest was done by the community....the next race was completed thanks to the voting campaign...and the third race was due to the sale of tshirst that moolah had nothing to do with....
