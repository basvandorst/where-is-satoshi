I mean, I am not going to lie, I looks pretty dope.
But you know what else is dope?
Keeping 12 grand.

If you're in Europe, I recommend Bitstamp and Kraken. Anything with SEPA really. Also Bitstamp has had Segwit fully deployed for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:32:46
Not without having had 0 face to face interaction with the other party. And also it's not really a comparable scenario since you're paying something, not waiting for something that already belongs to you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:07:43
Please do elaborate. I am genuinely curious about the connection.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:34
Calm down, this is pretty much a normal event at this point in Crypto.
You're down a 100$. That's not the end of the world.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:07
You sure bud?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:38:41
Yeah uhm no. No sensible human being does $1.8M in a single transaction. Even huge business to business deals are performed in instalments.
Calling major BS on this one.

Thanks for the headsup! Looks like there is little I can do then. Any recommendations for German users trying to buy bitcoins reliably? I use Coinbase's Wallet but can't buy through them.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:05:23
I'm sorry, but this just sounds way too fishy.
Given your story I'm getting vibes that those BTC were not acquired through legitimate means. On top, you seem interested in avoiding any sort of taxes that you would face in Europe.
If you're legit, find a friend that has residency and set this up with him on a legit exchange.

Panic is always followed by instant regret. Had to learn that the hard way several times.

It should be notable that Cex.io doesn't actually have an office in London, but merely a dead drop mail box. Interestingly enough the banking details that they use are the same as for a now defunct HYIP Scam called Albion Union that was supposedly based in London but also operated from Latvia.

Holy crap I'd be mad.
Yeah my case is not as bad. Sold 2 btc at 3850 thinking the dip was going to be stronger. Plan to rebuy tomorrow once the dust has settles but I expect I wont be able to buy below 4000
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:39:18
Are you still referering to coinbase? I have no experience in how coinbase handles SEPA. but you should give it 3 days.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:34:33
Coinbase is easy and straight forward. Their purchases using creditcards have low fees compared to other exchanges. But when SEPA is an option other exchanges are significantly more costeffective.

This guy is my favourite. Look at that massive amount coming in and staying (mostly) the same over the past 3 years.
If this is a single person (which is not too unlikely), that guy went from being quite rich to having secured generations to come in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:03
If you're located in Europe. Check out BitStamp.
Certainly not, I'd say Bitcoin is on Sale right now ;)
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:06:29
In all fairness, that same transaction would have cost you a maybe 20 cents on BCH. Fees need to go down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:08:58
Yes it's high and bad. Why would incentivising people not to transact be a good thing? If you want no one to have control over your assets, you want nothing stopping you from transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:45:26
I don't disagree, but what really makes bitcoin that precious? At the end of the day it is its users. If the users lack use cases because fees become unbearable, then what is the point? It's users will migrate and something like this weekend happens.
I want bitcoin to succeed. I own way too many for it to fail like this, but at the end of the day, I want to own bitcoin to use them.
Comments like these give me the impression that it is no longer about true freedom and financial independence. But much rather about competing for getting rich quick.

I have been trying to sell my 2015 Ford Focus for well over half a year now for BTC and it has been a nightmare. 
I haven't gotten a single request that is actually interested in the car, but instead I am getting shady people offering me bitcoin or paid memberships to miner clubs, some bullshit MLM stuff and what not. When they realise that I actually no my shit they usually stop responding or get pretty unfriendly... Loads of people out there trying to scam people that want to get into crypto but know nothing about it.
That being said, best of luck selling your car dude! It's a beaut!
PS: If anyone is looking to buy a Ford Focus Titanium Sedan in Germany though let me know! ;)
@_date: 2018-03-05 13:12:43
They don't just have fees but most importantly, they have rates.
 for example rates a Bitcoin at roughly 9000€, but they are trading on Bitstamp for over 9300€ right now. So that would be another 3%

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:39:02
Bought loads at 4200 and some more at 4500. Still have some from 2800 around though. I am slightly worried, but I only spent what I would be willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:23:40
There has always been a difference like that. With the amount of fees and time everything takes to process factoring in the potential risks in the meantime, it's not worth your time. Just go to Coinmarketcap and compare the prices to some exchanges in the Far East, at first seems like a good way to make some easy fast money right? But trust me, it's not.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:03:24
Anything particularly funny about that? I mean it certainly is a drug that is not used solely for recreational purposes.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:49:58
Work is very often a factor in drug abuse. 'Limitless' may not have been a great movie, but it's quite true to life that many people abuse drugs to live up to the expectations of their jobs.
Amphetamine keeps you focussed over long periods of time and keeps you awake. 14 Hour shifts and overnighters are extremely common in the IT industry. Blame is probably not the right word. As soon as a drug sneaks into your daily life and especially something like work, the addiction potential is quite high. Not long before you know it, you start telling yourself that you can only meet certain targets when under the influence.
It's a topic major companies often sweep under the rug. But performance enhancing drugs are a reality in corporate life.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:15:43
Having worked with devs extensively I can confirm that there is a lot of work related amphetamine abuse. Especially when it comes to impending deadlines 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:30:08
Yeah but the reasons they are getting rid of the 500 is the same they are slightly anti crypto. Both are predominantly used in unmarked or otherwise illegal transactions.
@_date: 2016-05-07 12:14:10
Hey, so I used the service a couple of times for getting acquiring bitcoins. That worked just fine. However I have not tried it the other way around.
