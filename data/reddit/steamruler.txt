The issue with that hard fork *in my opinion* is that it basically says that the blockchain is immutable unless there's a bug in a smart contract used by a lot of people, at which point they will hard fork to break immutability and fix it.

Because Google, Facebook, etc. all have security bug bounties for a reason: **to prevent exploits from being sold and used, potentially putting them in bankruptcy.**
There is no point in having such a program if you don't pay more than those who look to exploit it.

Not as heavy as losing all their bitcoin.

Most companies would easily pay above $25000 for something like this, because it has the possibility to kill off their company in a couple of keystrokes.
The **only** purpose of security bug bounties is so that you won't just go and sell it to someone who will exploit it, who in this case would've easily paid more than $5000 for it.

Especially when it comes to potentially large amounts of money. Even the most trustworthy might stab you in the back over a hundred thousand bucks.

Payouts are done through HackerOne, as he said in the OP. Done through another company which deals in USD.

As discussed on the comments in the link, cooling equipment in space is quite hard. Not to mention how quickly mining equipment moves, so they'd be redundant quite fast.

But seriously, disregarding any implied sarcasm tags, storing anything on a low profile private server, or your own machine is more than secure enough.

He's not talking about mining. Validation is part of the foundation of Bitcoin. If you can't validate in feasible time, it's useless. Everyone needs to be able to make sure an address owns the Bitcoin it does.

They do own them, but don't have access to them. Picky but important decision - it makes it a crime to steal keys.

Humans are horrible at randomness. If you want random, just generate a key.

How much encryption is required to meet that spec? Could they just just XOR it with a constant and store it next of the data, and still be within those requirements?

High transaction fees are something you can live with if the currency is stable, because it doesn't affect them since they have alternative payment methods for those who don't want to pay the fees, and enough people use it to cover the costs of keeping it around.
When the currency is unstable, the value will have changed once the payment goes through, and you need to make another adjusting transaction with the same extreme fees, potentially paying it themselves.

Kinda weird considering this website deals with Bitcoin the **anonymous** currency.

Well, one is pretty long and directly gives you access to the coins, the other one is shorter and also requires access to the wallet.

Those problems are already solved in other locks by using batteries and having the lock not stay in the unlocked position, essentially only allowing it to be unlocked and then closed before locking again.

I had to manually create a .key file to import my private keys for my vanity addresses and I can confirm that it only downloads the blocks from when the earliest address was created (You have to specify the creation date/earliest transaction, thank $deity for blockchain.info and the ability to look up the earliest reference of an address).

Android reads the IMEI from the bootloader through a /dev/ device. I've created files that would get read instead of the /dev/ device before (accidentally, on a server).

I first got an HTC Desire near it's EOL. If it was an iDevice, I would've been stuck on the latest official version (Froyo 2.2 in my case), but no, this thing had the biggest modding community I've seen. When I switched to my Nexus 4 I was running 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich), I think.
My only iDevice is an iPad 2, which is also going to reach EOL soon. Guess it's time for an Android tablet.

I assume it would be cheaper than buying the item in itself but expensive enough to allow people devoting some time to it. You could pull the prices from Amazon, cut them in half, convert to BTC and round them off to mBTC.

Signed "trusted" jar files can contain malicious code, if you have the money getting a certificate is easy and it has to be revoked by the CA **which may take a week**. That's one week of blind trust and non-sandboxed java viruses...
