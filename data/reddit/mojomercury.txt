OP, if you have some deep existence altering truth why hide it?
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:52:06
Ideally that would be included in the negotiation. If it's an expense issue just say so. Anything is possible for the right price.

Local growers need to form a co-op then.
How is this a new issue? Unless there is lack of quantity or quality or some kind of local repression all you need is some motivated individuals to push something like this to happen.

Buy whatever computer you want, disable network functionality and don't connect it to the Internet. You now have an air gapped machine.
To be super spy you could boot a secure OS off of a flash drive or alternate hard drive to scan/check files (assuming transfer over USB/DVD/CD) then boot into your normal OS and bring files in. Make sure you remove your flash drive and keep it with you or secure your normal OS hard drive so your system can't be physically lost/stolen.

Anyone that thinks Bitcoin is the crypto savior of society is beyond delusional.

I didn't say will, I said could....
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:39:29
Many are of the opinion that (in the long run) BTC is only going up.
At the same time we are currently on the leading edge of "the next bubble" and based on the previous halvening we will see a large spike before the market "corrects" and BTC price stabilizes again.
However, some hold the opinion that the price will stabilize higher than what it was recently ($1000+) and this heralds the beginning of BTC truly becoming "mainstream" and will only help solidify BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:46:54
Thank you.
@_date: 2016-06-25 01:27:28
It depends.
The 21m limit could be increased. "Value" will be determined by what society sees in BTC. No one can forecast what will happen with BTC because it is the first of it's kind.
There could be other crypto currencies (there are but none as successful as Bitcoin) but I'm unsure of what their function could be as Bitcoin seems very flexible and adaptable.
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:32:24
OP is assuming a long term stable USD/BTC price relationship.
OP is also assuming BTC will be traded by average Joe. Doubtful.

Suppose the current trend, "to the moon" as you all say, holds and some of are interested in cashing out a portion of our holdings. Say 1BTC when it's $1500+
Just hit my Circle wallet and deposit to bank while it's high?
What if I had a larger holding of $10-15 thousand to exchange? Can you get a better rate or guaranteed exchange value? Or is that what GBTC sort of handles?
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:52:46
How do you see this playing out? Yeah this tech will be adopted for all kinds of shit and all it will do is make fraud much more difficult to do and offer a way to secure transactions.
A hybrid system is the likely outcome for the immigrate future and transitional period where regular norms continue to deal in cash/credit while the banks and records are all converted and rectified via public block chain every X (day, hour, whatever computing power dictates at the time) it's not going to be a flip of a switch and we're buying cokes out of a machine with a few satoshi.

Smart contracts!
Technically the Blockchain can be used to sign/verify any kind of data.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:24:00
I like how the video talks about using these to physically exchange Bitcoin to keep the transactions private/off the blockchain but wouldn't a crypto currency with inherent privacy and fungibility just be a better solution?
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:13:40
Something something honey badger?
Am I bitcoining right?
@_date: 2017-04-16 12:13:23
1) Bitcoin is not anonymous.
2) Telling people every device they own becomes part of the future bank probably scares them more than you realize.

The ONLY thing bitcoin has going for it is being first.
As soon as better tech comes along look out....

Well the internet isn’t free either!
Damn it! I had to pay for my laptop/phone/tablet too!
What’s up with all this paying for stuff?!
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:30:59
So which ones do you like?
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:21:23
While this is an idealistic view, it’s not far off. Blockchain analysis is becoming a more important tool everyday and all it takes is an IP address and time stamp to tie you to your crypto. Don’t forget this applies to any coin that doesn’t enforce anonymity by default.
There won’t be ATM’s much longer, they’re just silly unless you are dealing with physical notes.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:10:29
So this is your “it’s a feature not a big arguement”? It’s good enough?
I realize we live in a world of compromises, but it gets easier to track the digital bread crumbs everyday. If any crypto is going to become the new world standard the average Joe has to have no reason to doubt it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:18:28
I mean there can be work arounds, but it will have to be offered off chain unless you like the super slow development and all the bickering that has plagued Bitcoin because that’s what will continue to happen if you want on chain privacy solutions.
First isn’t good enough anymore and more people are realizing this.

@_date: 2017-10-14 02:30:19
Neither has Bitcoin it is still “first”.
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: lack of privacy will kill Bitcoin.

You mean this rocket ship may run out of fuel or be surpassed by a better rocket ship?
I have some BTC,  but most of the posts I see here are straight up delusional. BTC is only on top because it was "first" this won't last forever. Fungibility is a necessity to truly replace cash.
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:55:08

How do any of your capital gains taxes get calculated? Probably through the exchange/brokerage.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:31:36
But it's only as anonymous as your IP address or wallet address. Fungibility is BTC's biggest weakness.

Or like use something with privacy like built in.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:46:03
I mean you can try that but I bet the government would be able/willing to use blockchain analysis to present reasonable evidence that you have BTC holdings. They're willing to hold people indefinitely for not giving up a password, so enjoy being digital rich in jail.
Do I think the bill is a serious concern? Not at this stage, but it shows that crypto is on the governments radar and proves a need for fungibility that BTC may never provide.

Pokemon is an established franchise, I'm missing the parallel here.

Ok, but it doesn't and it won't.
BTC is a long way from being built into mainstream games like Pokemon.
