You seem to have a lot of misunderstandings about the underlying technology. I am not here to lecture you. Good luck to you.

Well is it? I mean showing that it is possible for a to low number of hops for an isolated number of payments does not in any way mean, that it is deployable for the whole network.


If I give you rocket boots and you run 100m in 20seconds when you were running 50 seconds previously, you still are a shit athlete. The problem is that even with the privacy concerns and the centralisation associated with lightning network. It still is basically less usable than other crypto currencys (from a fees and transaction time perspective) Not to mention that every user is exposed to immense danger having an open channel with an open private key on your hard drive.
This example should show that even with lightning network not running on the main chain, it is not in any way more usable than any other crypto currency. Quite the contrary if you ask me. I mean it shows horrible red flags concerning the original idea of bitcoin and is **still is more expensive**
I do not get how anyone can see this as a success for bitcoin. I do not root for any Crypto, but how anyone can see it as a success for bitcoin if lightning is shown to be less usable than it was promised is incomprehensible to me.

Could you elaborate on that?
