If you are so upset, why don’t you move to another exchange? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:20:32
Bitcoin is stable. If I had Bitcoins I would sleep at night. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:11:30
Cash out?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:13:34
When did he say that? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:08:52
He said bearish not up. 
Moons and lambos are coins ��

Do we sell and buy Tron?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:34:09
Bubble burst?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:18:42
I don’t think it’s fake news. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:12:30
Start taking profits. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:53:05
Old news. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:37:41
People are exiting the market, volume goes down. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:51:43
Has bitcoin crashed? 
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:07:05
Come on mate, if you need to ask if this is a scam. Crypto not for you.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:29:26
Sell and buy back in a few days?
@_date: 2019-07-20 06:34:02
Some people are just thick.
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:16:22
IQ Alert 
Crypto is deffo not for you. 
I’m unsure if English is your first language.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:44:01
What a stupid comment to make, you honestly think that you would get away with it. Exchanges are already working with tax agents.
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:22:31
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:47:19
No country in the world can ban Bitcoin, it’s like trying to ban air.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:31:18
What is the ROI timeframe?
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:58:26
You do realise exchanges are giving all their information to the tax authorities. It may take them a few years to get around to you but they will. In the meantime late interest and fees are building on your account.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:11:40
Use a Bitcoin Wallet
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:34:18
Why is Bitcoin being compared against shares??
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:22:57
To the moon
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:46:03
You pay tax on crypto to crypto transactions. I can see you ending up paying huge fines in back taxes. Some people should not get involved in investments that they do not understand.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:24:07
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:13:05
This is not good. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:18:01
That’s ridiculous, paper is one of the most fragile storage methods.

“Mad Money" host Jim Cramer actually said futures trading would "annihilate" bitcoin.
"I think the short selling is just going to annihilate people when you can start trading it," Cramer said after speaking with sources in the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:37:28
New Age Nostradamus! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:38:27
Push shove lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:01:37
In my opinion you make more money in the long run by buying and HODLing. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 04:59:16
This is where privacy coins come in.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:59:54
Mostly exchanges! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:35:50
It will go mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:27:07
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:53:59
Yes, you will be taxed on the profit you made. Day trading can be high risk, I know very few people who actually make money from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:00:12
Yes, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:23:28
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:00:48
It’s already in the process of correcting. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:23:18
@_date: 2019-11-03 06:59:21
How much are you willing to lose?
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:54:10
Putin knew he would discredit the US by putting Trump in charge.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:09:52
Why where you using a dodgy exchange in the first place???
@_date: 2019-11-13 06:18:40
Unlikely the US is years behind China in blockchain tech.
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:27:53
Buy on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:47:29
* do
@_date: 2019-11-21 08:40:30
Invest in a hardware wallet cheap skate.
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:11:19
Some people deserve to lose all their crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:10:19
Lock him up, lock him up. 
Looking forward to seeing Trump impeached.
@_date: 2019-11-20 06:04:08
They will see your wallet address only. 
However they can use this to find out how much crypto you are holding in that address.
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:08:42
Well done, it’s the gateway drug to being a millionaire.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:16:24
Why are some people so mean with their fees.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:17:56
It’s actually quite the opposite.
@_date: 2019-11-16 21:55:36
Ah I’ll give you an up vote.
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:58:59

Please, not this meme again.
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:09:48
Pay your taxes.
You will get caught out in the end and will have to pay taxes plus interest perhaps fines. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 14:33:20
No it’s genuine. 
No more FUD thanks! 
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:25:24
Looks like we are vey very close based on Reddit sentiment. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:48:25
NKN will solve this issue. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:41:19
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:12:09
I yr old account with 162 Karma trying to spread FUD ��������
@_date: 2019-08-13 06:22:05
Sounds like money laundering?
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:54:45
Brilliant ����
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:36:34
If you get caught you lose everything. 
Is it worth it?
@_date: 2019-08-13 07:35:51
Sounds like ML not it is ML. 
Read the opening post again.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:05:05
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:13:43
This is getting old very quickly.
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:31:55
Momentum &amp; volume decreasing. 
Bearish price action. 
*Not financial advice!
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:22:17
Looks great well done!
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:00:02

@_date: 2019-10-19 05:50:04
Are you doing something illegal?
@_date: 2019-08-13 06:18:57
Why would anyone be stupid enough ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-08-24 09:41:43
I thought they caught him in a library?
@_date: 2019-10-19 13:53:27
Paranoia ������
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:15:20
It doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:12:15
No volume
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:45:53
If you are not doing something dodgy, why not buy from an exchange like everyone else.
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:19:55
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:24:29
No only the beginning unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:36:00
Nobody takes you or the article seriously ����
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:31:05
Crypto markets are up. What are you talking about ��
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:28:05
Ha brilliant 
@_date: 2018-02-20 04:41:22
Blockchain is different than cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:48:36
This is a joke lol
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:18:29
Here’s a good article on exchanges. 
[Cryptocurrency Exchanges]( 
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:30:01
Nano would have a long long way to go to compete with Bitcoin. 
If ever ��
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:32:49
Why would you want to share something like this. 
Are you giving the enemy idea’s? 
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:19:14
The US dollar has no value and is not backed by anything. It’s printed from thin air. 
Why would Bitcoin be dependent on it?
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:38:15
BTC will always equal BTC
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:51:33
I’d buy either over the Toyota any day.
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:22:28
It’s a Toyota, why would you want a Toyota?
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:32:55
Why would anyone in their right mind choose a Toyota over one of the luxury cars.
@_date: 2019-09-29 06:34:48
So you would choose to buy a Toyota over a Merc or an Audi for the same price. 
You need to do your research.
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:29:11
Bitcoin is not backed by the dollar. You really do not understand how crypto works. 
The Dollar is worthless and will be obsolete in a few years. 
I suggest you google blockchain.
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:22:39
Why would it be expensive?
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:37:08
Onwards and upwards the more publicity the better. 
Bitcoin is not here to participate, Bitcoin is here to take over! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:51:44
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:19:53
Looks great!
@_date: 2018-04-05 09:48:33
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:28:27
Most are accumulating 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:54:03
More like a bear trap.
