Without the encryption she can just copy and paste the bitcoin!!! She solved the budget!

If you want to know everything that is wrong with the EU (MEP expenses aside..) research the ban of tobacco advertising in motorsport. I agree with the concept in principle, it's a good thing, but it isn't 'trade'. They took a tenuous power grab that was not really supported in law, and were fought back on that ground and beaten by Germany. A few years later they went for it again and this time they were successful. 
Where the EU is now is not necessarily a bad thing,  but having spent a year of my degree studying how it works, I think 30 years from now when I tell my grandkids why I voted out, they will look at Europe and thank me.
I don't revel in ignorance, but I have no idea who my MEP is without looking it up. I don't know what they stand for, or what they represent, and this is consistent across the country and across the EU. This law making monolith is creating laws because it has to to justify it's existence, and is allowed to continue because of an uninformed electorate.

I think that is a completely sensible plan, good thing she supports all that strong encryption to keep the database secure.

I studied law, not economics, and I voted out, but I think long term it doesn't really matter, it will work out. My fear is that half baked politicians will mess everything up and leave us in the single market, just with no say on policies, and undermine everything that leaving was supposed to achieve.

It sounds so obvious when you say it, but that literally never occurred to me before.

I always wondered what that stood for, but never got round to checking :)
