For all the vets dealing with PTSD writing in this post and anyone interested for a matter of fact... 
MDMA,  shrooms, the so called "spirit molecule" DMT, if used properly, setup and all that, can completely reshape your mind and, if you think there is one, soul. 
They are all controlled schedule 1 drugs in most of countries but, with studies like this, that can be changed. Legal mind numbing drugs are freely available and prescribed. And, as we witness,  don't work on the fine delicate fine tuned threads of the magnificent human mind. 
This study is revolutionary for a whole range of mind affecting illnesses which could be treated with various psychedelics. 
Please inform yourselves about psychedelics,  watch documentaries and read about the wonderful new discoveries in this field of science which was completely ignored for so many years,  read studies, experiences,  etc..  
We live and die without controlling ourselves,  our minds and thoughts, because that's how the society programs us. Only open minds can save this fucked up world. 
Peace &amp; love &amp; mind revolution! :)

As a psy connoisseur and a mind explorer and after seeing first hand how psychedelics cure needy and troubled minds and how they change faulty mind programming, let me say just this: i love u! Awesome!

This flippening shit is completely stupid. Never gonna happen. 
You have to be brainwashed not to grasp the idea that if Bitcoin is replaced by any FakeBitcoin you can kiss good bye the mass adoption. Who the fck would invest in something which can become fake overnight. 
I can already see the titles:
 "We told u so! Scam of the century! They switched the Bitcoin!“" Shocking! Do you own bitcoin? Now it's fake!".

Well,  he's not playing nice :). Anyway,  in my opinion,  the other "bitcoins" will soon wither and die off soon,  maybe this year,  who knows. In this game trust is everything. I wouldn't put my trust in something called Adibas.

Yap,  done it couple of days ago. Updated and created a new one to be safe. Tnx :) . 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:48:24
Thanks, just tried it, but now i think i breathed to much. Must stop breathing for now, thanks again.
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:14:07
This is all about trust,  that's all! If you would't buy a 15$ pair of chinese Adibas shoes why would you invest 1000$ in a trust-faulty sweatshop bitcoin-copy altcoin based not on trust but on hope? Wake up and analyze this with a clear head or u're gonna get burned. In Bitcoin we (all) trust! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:33:44
Yeah, sorry... "Imaginary guy in the sky loves Bitcoin", now it's fixed...
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:10:09
No. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:13:13
Sorry. Just checked it, seeems that the answer is yes.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:42:48

Well? ... What exactly an inflationary central bank coin have to do with bitcoin? Lost me. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:51:52
What i'm trying to say is the vast majority of people will never understand bitcoin. But that's ok, they don't need to. They just need to think it's a safe way to store a part of your wealth,like they think about fiat, gold, real-estate, etc.. 
To understand btc you have to know at least basic stuff about how money, markets, economy, programming, central banks, human psychology work. 
Ask around, people don't know how many teeth Homo sapiens has although they use a human body their hole life. 
Think coca-cola. If they see it everywhere they buy it. So "write" Bitcoin everywhere in big shiny letters until it gets written in their brains :).
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:04:26
The vast majority of people doesn't even know what inflation is...
@_date: 2019-10-18 22:44:42
First of all you're not buying btc on robinhood. You're buying casino money btc and robinhood is the house. 
Second no real bitcoiner uses that kind of shit casino fake ass money btc.
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:56:48
Everybody knows, it's on tv: bitcoin is dead.

Don't fall for tunnel vision. 
There's some data for you:

U ask him nicely to give it back and he will. That's how bitcoin works, it's based on love, peace and understanding. U can test it with me.

Never doubt bitcoin. U can doubt shitcoins. Seems that u don't know why u bought it, if u bought it for the right reasons you should have your answers. Hoard, HODL, spend/replenish.
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:43:18
I could be anybody, don't trust me. Do your research then try it...
@_date: 2019-10-18 22:36:39
Just buy 1000$ worth of BTC. That should be a good enough starting incentive to get yourself educated on it.
@_date: 2019-10-21 09:28:13
No idea, don't know if they use the same prices as they do online, i'm not romanian...
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:16:49
Cause "Bitcoin is dead", was on the news.
@_date: 2019-12-25 08:34:26
Seems he made a great choice. He bought the majority of coins from1000 to 2000. Even if to 6000 and still the right choice to this day.
@_date: 2019-04-18 21:20:32
1000-sell the house type 
2000-this is the real bottom type
3000-those who know people are waiting bellow type
over 5000 all merge in better FOMO sooner than later type
at least feels like it :)

More of a killer clown...

BTC loaded poker chips,  that would be awesome. Now that would be freaking hot. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:24:01
Buy some fiat. That should do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:24:32

@_date: 2018-02-15 23:22:08

@_date: 2018-02-15 23:03:36
Just wanted to ask: is this a stand-up comedy routine?
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:26:06
No, just makes this sub inflated with shitposts.
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:00:02

McAfee is a psychopathic piece of human shit and literally a shit eater as reported by his "girlfriends". A proved killer and a scammer.
Why should we talk about him here and especially related to Bitcoin? McAfee talking about Bitcoin is poison for us. Just ignore him.
