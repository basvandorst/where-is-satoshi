 My great aunt born in the US (received US SS) but living in Canada went to visit her son in LA but the bank refused to change her Canadian money into US money because she didn't have an account at the bank.

[FINTRAC]( banks, casinos anywhere large amounts of money are used. 
 At work we get yearly visits from the RCMP for training and they show stings where people try to hide money using dozens of people making dozens of transactions trying to hide money from criminal activity; drugs, smuggling, prostitution, gangs.
 A cashier whether you know it or not has a form where the are required to (or will be jailed) write down a description of you. Other forms are for you to fill out when transferring large amounts of money even $3,000 (or three $1000 transfers) or lower if you're not a Canadian citizen.

That's just it you can watch a pirated movie on a 60 inch 4K TV but it's not the same as going out to a movie theatre (ignoring screaming kids, weird people and annoying teens).
People should gamble for fun if they gamble for profit they're not understanding the concept of what games of chance or randomness are.
Nobody should expect to get their money back after they enjoy watching a movie and they shouldn't expect to get money back after gambling, even breaking even would be rare.

Yesterday I was reading [an article]( Yibada a Chinese English language news site and saw an article on Bitcoin and wondered if it would spike.

Imagine buying 1000 shares of Apple at $1/share and losing track of them then you find them 6 years later they're worth $1,000 each.

I had a few at $10 but I do recall seeing them at $0.00001 or something like that many years ago.

 As a long time user of Digg it died from too many unpopular changes they tried to be cool and fresh but people don't like change just for the sake of change; for no reason.

That what you get when world politics and finance is seen through the eyes of a 14 year-old redditor.
Plus the title violates reddiquette.
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:00:41
reddit is what it is for its stability but it seems to be getting more political and social with knee jerk reactions to every social injustice.
In the old days the world burned and we just talked about it.

 How about exchange rates of various countries e.g. 1 Canadian Dollar = 0.1 Bitcoin since it's nice to see it in the currency of the country I live in, Canada. Instead of just using the US dollar as the benchmark.
 for example if you want to purchase some Bitcoins you see it in US dollars and the equivalent in in Bitcoins but then have to do a side conversion of your own country's currency. Not the end of the world but annoying enough that I may not bother to do it and go browse Reddit instead.
 A small annoyance but if Bitcoin is meant to be a world-wide currency then I'd say make the world feel comfortable knowing what it's worth in relation to their money.

 It's not meant to literally be a person, good or bad, or even a person at all it's the event of that year. This year it may be Assad in Syria.
 It's like the upvote arrow it doesn't mean you like or hate the topic it's to promote the subject i.e. children being killed in Darfur you upvote to get attention not because you like seeing kids killed.

 Let me play the Devil's Advocate (i.e don't get your panties in a bunch) but seeing that Bitcoin was made by one person the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto how is that any better for security? 
 I mean from what I understand it is very secure but is that any better than what the RCM may eventually come up with?
 Is Mintchip even the same thing as Bitcoin or is it something entirely different?
@_date: 2012-04-05 13:58:11
 By 'different' I mean is it meant to directly compete with Bitcoin not the form that it is in.

 I find it odd a Bitcoin isn't 1 to 1 with the US dollar, maybe a slight difference which changes, to me that would be OK since the point of it is to replace currency and the most common in use is the US dollar.

Are you insane?
@_date: 2011-08-09 01:53:55
 Sure no reason to match but even for traditional state currency it's common for a country to devalue its own currency.

 I'm still new to this Bitcoin stuff why do they both have "Mt Gox" in their names? 
 What is Mt Gox and what does it have to do with Bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-07-19 15:42:31
 OK at least that's a bit more help.
 I tried Google and used the minus "-" switch to cancel out any links with Bitcoin in them to see if I could come up with why a name like "Mt Gox".

 Go for the Canadian gold it's the purest in the world.

 Pretty much, people understand buying stock and then selling it and pocketing the difference (profit) but *selling* something you don't have and then *buying* it but ending up still without any physical "thing" but pocketing the difference, again: profit. It's weird.
 I'd rather see Bitcoin options, safer and more profitable in a volatile market.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:55:22
 It's nice to see you're honest or rather *honourable* may be a better word.
 There was a recent story on Hacker News about someone who made a mistake and did something similar only it was $140,000 and the person who got  it knew it was a mistake and kept it.
 A couple of people in the comments at HN said they'd keep it I got my knuckles rapped for calling one an opportunistic prick.
 It's nice to see honest people but not having used bitcoin for a long time I don't know if there are better checks and balances or if this is common.

Yeah I was surprised at what I found on old thumbdrives, not hard drives, when I used PhotoRec just as a test. 
 There were entire hour long videos, you know bible stories ;) , on a thumbdrive I had used for years and the videos were old, I can't figure out how they could have escaped being overwritten.
