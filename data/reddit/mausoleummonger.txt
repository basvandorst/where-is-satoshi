That's freakin' awesome! I appreciate your digging it up for me, though for now I don't think I'll be using it for the picture frame simply because it's not the right style of image. If you were able to put up the editable file though that would still be pretty cool- I might copy your gift idea actually for one of my friends. lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:15:18
Yes, please! I've had trouble finding a good image for it, so if you could I would really appreciate it. I was looking for the actual coin itself, in any form really so long as it's just the coin 'background', the doge, and the letters (not hat or whatnot on the doge- I'm trying to make this as classy as is possible given the coin lol.. that said, I'm hoping for the letters to be the classic silly much coin so wow style writing).
This is all nitpicky, if you can find any good high-res image It'd be super appreciated. As of right now the best one I've found is 900x900.

*My Internet Credibility has been challenged.*
I've now got an even stronger desire to do this. I was toying with the idea of doing it yesterday, but now I'm determined. My honor and integrity depend on it.
Here's the problem I've run in to, though. The lowest amount I can buy on my exchange is 1039.0625, at the current rate (which of course is subject to change). That's all of $7.82, so not that big a deal. Weirdly, it won't let me sell what should be the lowest possible amount to sell of the other coin I have on that exchange (I've not got much on this one), so I ended up selling .0013-and-a-bit BTC worth and buying 2704.24328125 DOGE instead of 100.
It's a slightly larger amount than I had planned, but what could I do, y'know? The next issue was finding a good picture of Doge, which I actually struggled with. I had to make do with a lower quality image than I would have liked, but it'll have to do.
The next step is the wallet, which I'm making now. I'll update in a bit when things are a bit more put together, since I just noticed another redditor kindly offering to help find a good image of the dogecoin. I may ask if you'd be willing to send an amount of DOGE to the wallet that would round it off to a 'pretty' number, be it only 96 to push it to 2800 [roughly] even, or if you're feeling super-generous 296 to put it at 3000. You don't actually have to worry about that though, lol. I'm a bit anal about things like that, but I just didn't think to buy 2900 instead of 2740~ when I was buying the doge in the first place, and it's not really worth going back to make two more $40~ dollar transactions to fix the mistake. :/

I now have a plan to buy oh, I don't know, 100 Doge or something like that. Then I'm going to put it in a paper wallet, and print out a high-res picture of the coin's logo with the paper wallet just beneath it, and mount it in a small frame that I have sitting over in a corner [over there, I'm pointing to it right now]. I'm not sure why I would bother to do this, but I really love the idea of it. lol

[Here you go.](
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:19:38
Lol yeah, it's a huge consideration lol. Nah, I'm actually thinking I'll just put the private key immediately below the public key on the image (mostly just for posterity's sake- i.e. I think it'll look fancier). I'll just have to make sure to blur it out when I post proof lol.. I've been challenged. I must deliver.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:55
You don't have to worry about sending it until I've posted proof that it exists, but the public addres is 
I'm going off to print it now, then I'll post a pic of it. I'm really amused by this though, lol. I almost followed your pixelation suggestion but I decided to keep the theme of looking vaguely professional/legitimate, or as much so as a picture of Dogecoin can be. lol
Also, I'd just buy like an extra 5 or 10 coins to make sure the transfer fee is covered? I'm not sure how much it is exactly, but I know it should be rather inexpensive. You're awesome, by the way. :D Thanks for funding my ridiculous desk photo.

Absolutely agree with you. However, we've seen plenty to affirm that ISPs (and many other companies through nearly every other industry...) don't always act rationally, even when their own standards for rationale are based purely in their own self interest.
E: I like the application of game theory, though.

Overall, I don't think so either, but I think there *is* a reasonable risk that it could be tangibly harmful to the cryptocurrency market/community in the short-term. Long-term, though, crypto will absolutely overcome pretty much anything any particular government will be able to throw at it, at least I'd wager so.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:44:26
Very true! Unfortunately though, the popular opinion of crypto (both on a large scale, including people who are only barely aware it exists, and on a more concentrated scale of people involved in and at least vaguely knowledgable with crypto) rules above the innovation of any particular currency. At least, for now. I absolutely hope what I said above becomes false at some point in the future, but I don't think it is yet, or at least not in such a way that *truly* differentiates the various other cryptos from BTC in a meaningful enough way as to make one a true peer, rather than an alt. I don't think any crypto will truly reach that level for some time to come. 
That said, I'll concede this: I may well be completely wrong about the time scale, given how quickly it's been developing over the last year, alone.. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if by the end of 2018 a sort of 'altcoin revolution' took place, and Bitcoin's reign is contested by one or even many different alts. As it stands though, I'd place my bet on it taking a bit longer than that.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:54:00
Wow. You damn well called it. Good show my friend, good show.

While has a point about it's inability to effect BTC itself, there are a few strong arguments as to how harming net neutrality will also harm cryptocurrency. The most straightforward one being that if they can throttle bandwidth and charge more to allow you to access or use exchanges, or even more importantly throttle miners directly, that'd be a *huge* blow to the American crypto market, which certainly isn't an insubstantial portion of the total cryptocurrency market cap.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:25:54
Oh I actually agree with you completely! Sorry if the comment above was a little poorly written (it was quite late at the time), but in essence I just mean to say that the popular perception of BTC as better/more important/the same as (in the sense of 'they're all just cryptos' rather than seeing them as serving varied purposes) *is* still the most common perception of it, and that's what's keeping it above the rest and stifling the growth of the more innovative coins.
I absolutely agree with you though, Things like IOTA, ETH, LTC, XRP, *whatever* fulfill *far* more purposes than BTC alone could ever hope to, and between all the alts they fulfill every purpose BTC has or could have *better than BTC does*.
While it probably doesn't bode well for the market in the short-term (a couple years from now at most, I imagine) that BTC might fail as the others put more and more pressure on it, I don't think it's capable of evolving quick enough to maintain its dominance indefinitely. As you said, it needs to be agile and utilize newer tech as it becomes available/viable, but it isn't, and won't.
As always, this is all my opinion and entirely speculative, so take it with a grain of salt. Cheers!

already said this, but I don't think he really did justice to *just how incredibly significant* BTC's first-mover advantage is. It's the original, the basis from which all the others were designed, and it has *always* been the basis by which others are judged, and by the time exchanges came along, that role carried over to make it the currency pair for every single new currency that has been created (more often than fiat currency even, and by a large margin at that).
It's the first, the most well known, and the one with the greatest trust and assurance that it will maintain and continue to grow value. Add to that the fact that if literally anyone wants to get into any cryptocurrency *besides* BTC, the most direct possible rout to do so is usually *through* BTC, so even if you don't want to own BTC in particular you still have to contribute some amount of volume to its trading, and when thousands upon thousands of people do that on a regular basis it has a visible effect on the value of the currency, and that's just as a 'middle man' [of sorts, anyway].
No, I don't believe BTC is the 'best' currency out there, for nearly any role to be completely frank, but I *do* think it is and will continue to be the most valuable and heavily used cryptocurrency for a long time to come.
All this being my own opinion, of course, so take it with a grain of salt. Sorry for the ramble, and have a nice day!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:57:25
Cheers man. You did have a very solid point though, I just wanted to add this to it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:18
Even then, all of them (Ethereum included) are compared to Bitcoin above all else. It really is quite appropriate to label BTC as 'the gold standard,' imho. I'm not even that much of a fan of it compared to other altcoins (in the broadest sense, as in any coin that isn't BTC), but it's the basis by which all other cryptocurrencies' values are judged.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:45:03
Very idealistic, but... not necessarily wrong.
