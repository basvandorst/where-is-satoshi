What's the timeline for restoring the more esoteric currencies?

Does MIT plan on using this to expose government bribes?

I'm not sure using artificial intelligence to mine cryptocurrency is a good idea. Sounds like slavery to me.

Does the substitute ad use scripts? If so, it should be easy to just fry it with noscript.

Assuming that this isn't a 51% attack attempt, wouldn't this be hypothetically good for bitcoin, due to transactions confirming quicker?

The main reason why I use uBlock is because a lot of ad publishers seem to like using autoplaying ads from my experience. While firefox does have an option to mute ads, it's a pain in the arse.

There's this GTA:SA server I play on that I would prefer to donate to with bitcoin. Not sure if they accept it though.

Regardless of his track record, he is the person who I would trust to interview me if I were an attacker.

A hacker exploited a flaw in TheDAO that allowed them to repeatedly split the DAO, collecting millions of ether from the smart contract. There is now debate on whether or not to hard fork to prevent the attacker from withdrawing ether after the 27-day window.

Seems coin wallet got pwned

And the community will come to a consensus on whether to implement it in a few years.

Do you not see the issue here?

In my opinion, using Electrum loaded onto a virtual machine would work.

I love the premise, but the controls in Flyby mode are atrocious (it gets easier to swipe the slower your monkey is swinging despite the fact that this really shouldn't matter.)
Giving a x0 multiplier for going backwards is kind of rude, as well, given the aforementioned bad controls.

The Early Access gameplay kind of reminds me of Minecraft, but it looks pretty cool (though a bit dark, I'd suggest increasing the brightness a bit.)

Could you explain the differences between Lamport and ECSDA?

I own an Acer Iconia One 10.

Why does the Blockchain Alliance's logo look suspiciously like a Nazi Iron Cross? I guess it's a reference to Adolf Hitler; wanted to do good for his people (in this case, the elite), but did it very very wrong (sacrificing privacy.)

I thought the genesis block couldn't be spent, as it doesn't reference a previous transaction.
@_date: 2016-05-20 11:14:56
I like the game, but the controls in Flyby mode are terrible.

The touch controls seem to be partly based on luck [the monkey randomly decides to not let go depending on how fast you're going].
It also seems to work better sometimes to swipe backwards.

I would believe you would have to update the firmware, considering hardforks usually alter the rules by which Bitcoin operates.
