What are you searching for to find that? I'm seeing only maps that show the distrubtion of nodes being mostly in NA/EUR, but I'm having a hard time finding mining distribution maps. Link?

They don't necessarily need 100kbs of upstream if they have significant enough download speed. Not everyone needs to be a full node. Every bit helps, but again, you're trying to solve a non-problem.

I think you're overestimating how many miners actually have that slow of an internet connection. I think you're catastrophizing a bit. If you had any data to suggest that there are internet-challenged miners who are dramatically affected by this, I might be more understanding. But, I think you're overstating it a bit. Shrug.

There were some reports earlier last month of Chase bank accounts being closed arbitrarily when linked with a Coinbase account. 
To be fair, though, I also have a Chase College account and I've purchased around 7k worth of Bitcoins on that account and haven't had any of those problems. There are some theories flying this way and that that for larger purchases (10k+) they might be more likely to close your account, but... apart from that, it's hard to say. If you're worried, maybe avoid Coinbase for the time being. It couldn't hurt.

Yes, it'd be different than using dollars because of Bitcoin being an electronic currency. The exchange rate can change on a day to day basis so you might get slightly more or slightly less mileage out of your $100 depending on the days' rates, but things will be, on the whole, less expensive due to the lack of mandatory taxation. If you wanted to spend your Bitcoin, you'd first have to ask the sellers if they accept it. If they don't, you're best holding onto your cash. 
Instead of having a wallet with cash, you might have a smart phone with a Bitcoin wallet app on it, then when you're in the store, you can use your smartphone to send the Bitcoin to the merchant. The big difference is that it's all handled via the internet.

I don't know. That seems like a really backwards way to handle wallet security. You shouldn't ever have to worry about malware on a secure system anyway, and the upsides to having a constantly encrypted wallet dramatically outweigh any possible benefit of leaving your wallet unsecured. 
One point I do agree with, though, is that you should never have any amount in any single wallet that would cripple you to lose. But keeping any wallet unencrypted seems like a really, really silly idea. You should instead be more focused on keeping a secure OS environment than acting on the assumption that there's going to be a malware attack and you're going to lose your Bitcoin, though. 
I guess if you really need a parakeet-in-a-mine test, though...

Congratulations. You're still *that guy* for being a snarky malcontent about it. 
You're also wrong. Here's why: 


Yeah, the implementation failed. However, the transaction was visible on the blockchain, and given that Bitcoinstore is a platinum member of the Bitcoin Foundation, I wasn't particularly worried. Moreover, I submitted a ticket to customer service at 10:36 PM last night. I received a response from a Rep at 11:32 saying that he had forwarded my issue to their 'payment processor to confirm payment.' 
The following morning at 9:02 AM, I received a response saying that my order had been confirmed and packed. This was all information that I didn't really feel I needed to include in the OP. Less than 12 hours. 


Totally irrelevant.

If we're getting all literal, no. Marketing would describe the techniques used to encourage a purchase of one product over another. Economics would describe the flow of wealth for goods, debts and services subject to any number of *marketing* factors which alter that flow.

First of all, your question is unrelated. The development and expansion of bitcoin isn't necessarily correlated with the price. Your question just doesn't work in this context, which is why I can't answer it. I also don't remember saying anything even related to development and expansion -- I've just been talking about the price and how extrapolation only works sometimes, and even less predictably so with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:44:14

It also will never replace conventional piracy. Having one program that is only used on pirating copyrighted material isn't sustainable. It won't last. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:34:31
What an insanely stupid bet. The chances of Bitcoin being valued at 10k by ANY date is totally delusional. Yes, it's true, if you extrapolate its position based on the growth of the past few years, you get a value around 10k. 
The reality of the situation? Not gonna happen.

A downvote bot happened to downvote some otherwise useless and non-contributive posts earlier in the thread. While I'm not on board with vote manipulation, to be fair, the comment graveyard at the top of the thread seems mostly justified. Those comments are pretty much utterly worthless.

I'm not going to be able to change your mind, so I'm going to stop talking. The health of the network relies on constant mining for confirmations. Putting any hold on that just cripples that -- especially for individual transfers. Not even close to worth it. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:52:13
Here's my guess. The wallet that stores your Bitcoins is distinct from the wallet that Coinbase uses to sell (obviously) so you're just seeing a slightly more verbose transaction. Coinbase had to send the bitcoins from your individual wallet to a sale wallet and then sold. Hence, two transactions. 
Just my guess, though. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:54:17
Well yeah, I get the whole 'reddit echo chamber' phenomenon, but I sorta thought more people might stop jerking for a little bit. 10k per coin is just ludicrous. Bitcoin is strong, but that's really pushing it.

Effectively, there aren't many differences. Treat it like a volatile stock investment. If you invest $100 today, it might be worth 97 tomorrow and 103 the next day. If you're looking for a decent long term (6+ months) investment, $100 of Bitcoin isn't a bad choice. Certainly better than dropping it into a savings account, but less reliable in the long term than a $100 bond.

You generate coins in a shared pool proportional to your own hashrate contribution. If you provide 1% of the power in a shared pool, your payout of the block is 1%. Higher hashrate devices increases your percentage of the payout, which is why ASICs yield more than a CPU would. 
That all said, a block will be mined, on average, every 10 minutes. Adding/removing hashing power to the network increases/decreases the difficulty of mining a block so it remains 10 minutes no matter the total network hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:43:52


All correct.  


It's a pretty atypical situation for us, for sure. If multiple pools collaborated to drop at the same time, that could theoretically happen. As always, it's just one more strong reason for decentralization.
