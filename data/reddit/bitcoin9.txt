Thank you Tuethedane
I'm aware of the selection bias, which is why I am distributing this survey through a multitude of channels (businesses that accept Bitcoin, numerous Bitcoin groups online, universities....)
Appreciate your feedback and time

Hi darphdigger!
Thx for your time and effort to give me some feedback. The question you're referring to is a Likert scale question. So if you have made a purchase, I presume you also invested in a Bitcoin and obviously this indicates you have heard of it, or else you would have never invested in it.

I have to say that I like your enthusiasm. But I can't post anything until the project is turned in.

Hi toomanynamesaretook (realizing how cool this name was when typing it)
I can't answer this question because by doing so, I would give you the answer. I would like to say however that this survey has been reviewed by economic historian Garrick Hileman who is an expert in cryptocurrency.  
Thx for your participation!

Hi everyone!
I am looking for participants to complete a 5 min survey on consumers' perception of Bitcoin for my dissertation alongside supervisors Gorkan Ahmetoglu (Goldsmiths, University of London) and Garrick Hileman (London School of Economics).
This study measures your views and experiences with Bitcoin. Here is the link to the questionnaire: 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions: ex301id
Thank you!

Hi btcmanifesto
You are partially right. Step 1 (Mental Availability) of the survey tests your knowledge on Bitcoin. Step 2 - 8 are 'regular' survey questions. I do this to find correlations between someone's knowledge on Bitcoin and his/her Intention to Use (Step 8) Bitcoin.
Thank you for participating

Hi Fraxinus_ Excelsior!
Unfortunately I can't adjust the survey at this point. I did however put my email address in there if you have any questions or remarks. Feel free to hit me up: ex301id Your feedback can help me later on in my dissertation.

I will

It's very common that participants don't have the right answer to each and every question. So don't worry about that.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:03:25
For me there is no reason not to publish my results, since this is an academic study on Bitcoin and this will contribute to scientific literature on cryptocurrency.

Hi there
Appreciate your feedback. To give you a quick update, my questions were reviewed by Garrick Hileman (London School of Economics) and Gorkan Ahmetoglu (Goldsmiths, University of London). No to mention Max Keiser himself took a look at my questions today and he liked it. Many questions were also used in previous academic research. But I do sincerely respect your opinion and effort.

I see your point with some of your comments. I'm glad you took your time to go into detail on your earlier comment. I will take some of your remarks and put it in my 'Discussion' section.
Thanks for the support
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:21:04
I understand what you are saying. For the past 10 months I have been following the development of Bitcoin on a daily basis. So I am definitely aware of the issue you brought up. I appreciate your remark.

Hi BaurusdB!
Thank you for participating and your feedback!

Hi MaxSan
Thanks for your feedback. I'm Belgian but I'm doing my MSc in Consumer Behaviour in London. What are these 'holes' and 'double negatives' you are referring to?
