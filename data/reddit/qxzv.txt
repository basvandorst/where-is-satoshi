I don't think someone with those concerns is storing their material with me either.  They're storing it locally.

I'm a customer and not a business owner - why should I care about processing fees?

Was he really wrong?  This still seems true today.

You're losing purchasing power.  If you go to a bar that accepts BTC you're probably paying ~15% more today than you would have paid yesterday.

Banks will also give you your money back if there is such a breach.

This is the one that gets me (a Bitcoin hater).  I understand the tech for the most part, but I don't see why I should want a digital anonymous currency.  I really like my credit cards, and don't see what problem Bitcoin actually solves.

If that third party passes along a piece of the pie in the form of credit card rewards, then yes.  
@_date: 2014-04-10 10:03:52
So we're back into BTC being nothing more than speculation instead of currency.  This still doesn't provide any usefulness to me going forward.

Every customer pays the credit card transaction fee whether you use credit or not.  As a customer, you don't save anything by using BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:52:01
The business passes that fee onto cash (or BTC) users as well as credit users.  It's not like you pay less if you use cash in 99+% of businesses.

Why would someone pay me anything when something like Google Drive is so cheap and has such high uptime?
@_date: 2014-04-26 12:53:42
As a consumer and not a business owner, why should I care about transaction fees at all?  
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:17:02
I'm certainly not ignorant or poor, and $50 isn't enough to have me scared. However, I still don't own any BTC nor do I see why I should.  It doesn't solve any real world problem for me.

I appreciate the innovation, but what is the benefit to me? I don't drop money on everything that is innovative just for the sake of it.

Can you break it down for me instead of just calling me an idiot?  This is the way I see it:
- Business has inventory and prices credit card fees into the cost of the product. He charges $X for the product, and will pay ~3% transaction fee out of his end.
- Credit card customers pay $X, and the merchant pays the 3% as planned.  The customer makes 1-2% cash back using credit card rewards.
- Cash customers pay $X, and the merchant pockets the planned 3% fee.  The cash customer receives no discount.
- A BTC customer also pays $X.  The merchant pays less than 3% and pockets the rest of the planned transaction fee.  The BTC customer receives no discount.
Can you tell me where I'm wrong?  
EDIT: Not back from Facebook yet?  You'd been responding so quickly before.

You can send dollars to your friend across the country from your phone with no transaction fee as well.  PayPal may suck at some things, but it will do this every time with no problem.

Sounds interesting, but I can't imagine the financial incentive being worth it...like maybe a dollar or two a month tops.  I'll be checking in on the project though.  Good luck with it.

Relative to what? Even with the drop from ATH, it's still way higher than it was a year ago.

I was under the impression that he did go through with it and that a murder scene was staged and photographed to prove that the hit occurred.

A couple hours is stabilized?
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:56:10


Don't forget price protection, free extended warranty, fraud protection, etc. Credit cards are superior to bitcoin in every way for consumers.

Do you think needs to move huge amounts of wealth all over the world quickly?


I've used credit cards overseas many times with no problems.
