how is willybot a negligible effect on the price runup when willybot infact started the price runup.
bought millions upon millions worth of bitcoins that made mt.gox price rise and rise and rise and then people bought the hype buying in.
@_date: 2014-07-31 02:04:41
truly they are scared i wouldnt be surprised if they are behind the recent price drop aswell trying to shake out weak hands and make the investors nervous

downvoted but its true, they call it "rewarding the early adoptors" or "securing the network" but really he premined the coins and is now sitting on 10% of all the bitcoins that will ever exist. and as time goes on and coins are lost forever his 10% grows and grows.
@_date: 2014-11-10 21:46:51

transaction volume can be faked to go all time high with less then 1000 filthy fiat.
if you wanted bitcoin to appear as if it were thriving it would be a easy task to shoot small numbers back and forth. actually there was a post a few days ago of transaction on the blockchain doing just that.

yo roman why do you think the price is stalled/ dropped back below 600?
with all the legitimate good news and exposure shouldn't more people be buying in or getting interested?
the only "bad" news would be the NY thing and that is for 1 state in 1 country. not really huge for a worldwide currency
@_date: 2014-07-25 04:31:51
