It does not. I've read the Federal reserve charter relating to oversight. It very clearly lays out what they are allowed to see. There is not full transparency. And if you like conspiracy theories, the last president that tried to audit the fed was JFK 2 months before he was shot.

I think it will bounce around untill about april of 2020 when the re-acumulation starts to end. +-15 point swings periodically. Opportunities for day traders in the interim.

The latest Bitcoin core has a child pays for parent transaction. If it's a large some of money and you want to get it through fast you can use this mechanisms to add to it's fee. Some mining nodes allow you to request / pay for a transaction to be moved to the front of the line as well. Not sure what your situation is.

 I mean it's been cryptographically signed. As long as you have the signature of a wallet's to send you money there is no refuting it , unless that wallets doesn't have the funds to pay for the transaction. No one iss scamming, I was just thinking of how I could mitigate risk for me to accept payment quickly without waiting at all.
@_date: 2019-03-16 22:54:54
Can't agree with this enough. I've given 7 talks on Bitcoin and if you can digest this you can handle any tech questions.
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:45:41
Right that's true, but you are guaranteed they will eventually be signed as long as they aren't double spending the same coin (or yours get confirmed first), and you have a copy of the transaction so you can make sure it gets on the mem pool. Unless I am missing something? But yes not ideal, and useless for small transactions.

If someone sends me money with no fee and therefore I expect it to take a long time, as long as there is sufficient money attached to that wallets private /public key there is no way for them to double spend the transaction with a higher fee to have me not get paid correct?
And if I scan the block chain for other transactions with that wallet, and I see a double spend, I could add to the transaction send fee to make sure my transaction goes through first? 
I know a few mining pools allow you to request moving a transaction to the front, does thos safeguard against double spend?
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:11:15
These are the sorts of points I can really get behind!
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:48:53
Thank you for the info. So 


I though that was the double spend attack? Sending through an invalid transaction so it gets dropped?
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:07:34
Cool yeah that's my take. But I am really curious about the 0 confirmations scenario because that is what makes it instant, or usable like credit cards without the lightning network. If I have a store that accepts bitcoin, then I see a zero confirmation transaction pop up in the mem pool , and they walk out of the store I am getting my money, unless that is already spent with that wallet? But o could add in extra gas fee to help mitigate this scenario?
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:40:58
So why not just have 0 cost fee, and determine any transactions in the mem pool with no confirmations valid?
@_date: 2019-10-11 04:15:18
Well also consider what causes the price to go up or down. When you execute an order that fills someone else's open order. Say if they sell off a bunch to execute lower and lower buy orders causing it to drop. There would be almost no sell orders in the gap they just create so just a tiny fraction of buy orders right after would cause the price to bounce back almost instantly. There is also arbitrage but every other person and whale is playing arbitrage with sitting orders so as they sell off a bunch its causing the same thing to happen on all the exchanges anyway.
Edit: Also all the holders that just wait to buy the dip also nerfs this

So to host an atm you need to meet kyc/aml, register as a money services business etc... There is a law firm out of newyork that specializes in making sure you have all your federal and state boxes checked. They have worked with a handful of startups. The legal estimates for doing everything the right way has been as high as $ 1 million to do a Nationwide launch in every state. Some states have adopted really crypto friendly laws and to do a single state launch in those I think it was around $100k. 
The SEC has a policy of no jail time for messing up, but for people that are purposely not doing what they are supposed to they had hit people with a lifetime ban on working anywhere in the financial industry. At least that's what they said at the disrupt sf confrence last year. Not sure if that's changed. 
DM me if you want me to give you the name.of the law firm.

The general concept is good. What if you had a system where you generated three pieces and distributed them to three people you trust and any 2 of the three could reserve the private key?
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:33:46
Really someone put the same short form?!

Yeah I don't think that's going to happen.

Its extremely important.  We must have side chain technologies to officially eliminate fiat because of the transaction through put. Without them bitcoin will just be a store of value, while still important won't replace fiat.
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:26:50
Not relevant, I'm almost certain bitcoin uses ECDSA
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:11:40
Instead of putting cash in cards I write the 12 words of the key, then give them a trezor and instructions on how to recover it. They get the bitcoins and find it fun like a real puzzle. And I get the satisfaction that they are now prepared for the future!
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:18:02
Yeah I have done 7 talks on block chain/Bitcoin (using the original whitepaper), over the last few years. Everyone always asks where bitcoin gets its value from (mostly business owners looking to capitalize). My answer is always the same. The value literally comes from the fact that no one owns it, is literally where it value comes from. By extension it's not logically possible for a company to start their own centralized coin, own it, and make it have value. If that were true every mmo he currency would have value beyond usage in the game.
What we will probably see is a tail end of investors jump on board that don't know the history of xrp/ripple. Loose all their money and have it tank. Doesn't mean Zuckerberg won't get rich off the scam, but for us in the space we have already seen how this plays out. He is just trying to scam the main stream.

You really have no reason to trust me. The simplistic most conservative way to verify this is with two Google searches. 1 how long does it take to Brut forc rsa 2048. And 2 how much faster is quantum computing. Apply your multiplyer and you will arrive at a number which is at least as long as what I said. This is assuming no one finds a flaw in rsa algorithm itself, bit then all bets are off anyway, and rsa is pretty tried and true at this point
@_date: 2019-01-15 20:42:43
I did not ☺️. I don't know the Brut force for ecdsa off the top of my head, but I imagine it's comperable
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:58:21
This isn't realistic. Current rsa 2048 Brut force times are around 6.4x10^15 years. Millions of times longer than the age of the universe. I work in cyber security evaluating crypto algorithm implimentations. I spoke to one of the physicists at IBM about their quant computer. This isn't the type of thing they are good at because quantum theory requires many iterations to get a statistically correlated response, so he said they are a looong way from use in cryptography. but even you could attempt a key in a single operation and an operation is ~10^6 faster in theory your still talking ~million years in theory with a perfect quantum computer. Aaaaand rsa 4096 is already available and built into crypto libraries. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:11:33
I didn't realize it used ecdsa until someone corrected... Ty. So I have spoken to the in guys and messed around with their open source 2 qubit computer. Question, when you say it can be broken with 2330 qubits, what is the time frame? And is that a brute Force based attack or is there some more efficient attack based on the curves? I work love any reference material for learning.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:39:41
The value comes from the fact that no one owns it. That's why alt coins that were initially started from an owner or company are essentially viewed as scams, even of their implementation meet all the other criteria.

Usually they hold your money for like 4 days before they allow you to send your money off
@_date: 2019-09-09 05:55:52
No this is true. I worked in cryptography at the time. A co worker told about this bitcoin thing as a fun project. At the time there were faucets so we could just have fun sending fake money around. He explained that you sign it with your private key and just call it money. I was too much of an engineer and thought it was the stupid thing, because you can't just call something money and expect people to pay for it. Boy was I wrong. Didn't get into it until way later with the test of band wagoneers. Got in touch with him a few years ago to ask. He didn't even save his private key with the early coins because it was more of a fun math project for cryptographers at the time. Truthfully even those who knew didn't really expect it to be as revolutionary as it was. Of course now its my religion and savour to all central monetary corruption haha.

I watched this a few years ago when it came out. The first half is creepy but the second half is really good. I feel like this was the first one that taked about the issue of fractional banking. I think ots worth a watch. But also it seems wierd that the guy who did this hasn't done much sense.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:06:28
I totally disagree. I would guess that no more than $100 of the 4k value comes from informed users like yourself. The rest of the value comes from speculators and investors that don't know anything other than the word Bitcoin be the synanomous with crypto currency and that it was the first. And looking at the history I would  guess that $95 of the remaining $100 comes from illicot acitivity on the dark web. If that's true then the psychology of investors is the only relevant thing that matters. And that's the part that people are worried about changing.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:13:43
But your setting up the situation where people would simply choose to use a different crypto currency. The value is based on psychology and speculation. If there are literally thousand day of other options, many of which don't have fees, a lot of the people that are more of investors, and non tech/purest would simply leave. And it was them that made it high in the first place. Saying no one should use no fee transactions is strong ecvidence that there is a potential problem in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:43:36
Correct me if I'm wrong but if mining gets cut in half the time would grow exponentially unless the number transactions goes down?

Yeah he is all about men and women working together, and very clearly shows them having equal IQ, and helps a lot of women get ahead in the workplace as part of his clinic. In debated he simply states what he beleives (usually backed up with a ton of research) and people take that as provoking, which is rediculous. Also he didn't miss interpret bill c16, it's that it added transgender to the list where there are 30 years of science that is  mental disorder "gender dysphoria" and so it warranted further discussion and he was afraid of not being able to have the discussion on campus as part of his teachings as a professor.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:04:21
So if the mempool is overloaded it is now taking longer for a given no fee transaction to go through. Which means during that time the mempool will grow even bigger. People will have to decide if they want to pay a fee or not transaction or be ok having it take exponentially longer. As someone pointed out earlier, last time that happened it was +10x  longer. Is that incorrect?
