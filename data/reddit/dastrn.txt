The only bitcoin I ever bought was for *eleven dollars*. Anyone who wants to play smug when the price *fell* to 1000x my initial investment is welcome to.

They are maybe 10x the size of the CIA. It's a fair bet that most of our intelligence is NSA. I'm against OVERREACH by ANY government agency, but to simply be "against" a security agency because of their occasional (or more likely frequent) overreach is probably taking it too far.
Why aren't you against the FBI? What differentiates the two in substance and in practice?
I'm just some schmuck on the Internet. If you're running for public office then I hope to god that you are ready to answer.

So you believe our government should have absolutely zero intelligence out there? No one to keep track of known terrorists and weather or not they enter or country? No internal auditing?  No one responsible for enforcing federal law whatsoever?
Do you realize that this would make us the only nation on the planet with no intelligence agencies whatsoever? Last on the list. Uzbekistan would have a better awareness of the risks around then than we would?  That's preferred in your eyes? 
I find it hard to believe that you've thought through the ramifications of this point of view. If you did, you either wouldn't be running for office, or else you'd be doing so just to waste the time and energy of your supporters.

Which intelligence agencies have not over stepped legal boundaries? How about which courts? For that matter, name a department of the federal government that has not done so? I'd be shocked if there was a single one. 
My point in this discussion is that your stated opinion is vague and easily to dismiss if you're reasoning also disqualifies other intelligence agencies. What you SHOULD say is that you are appalled at the over reach of our government intelligence agencies overall, particularly when it comes to the privacy of American citizens. That's easier to defend when challenged by your 19 year incumbent. Good luck in your race but be ready for the shit storm. Because every time you mention the NBA and not FBI, someone will have a specific challenge to that. If you put one above the others then the newspaper will print how you are more OK with the CIA wiretapping our phones than you are with the NSA doing the same with our Internet history,  or something. You will be cornered. You will be forced to back track and lose face or else stand and be slaughtered by your opponents big supporters in public forums and in newspapers and in mailers and whatnot.
I'm all for politicians being high on bit coin and marijuana and against government overreach and big spending. So more power to ya. Just be ready for the sharks, is all I'm saying.

You're just flat-out against the NSA in it's entirety?

Solicitation is itself a part of the definition of collusion. You can try arguing that this wasn't solicitation, but you'd simply be wrong.

Contributions made by foreign governments with intent to influence our elections are illegal. Soliciting them is also illegal.
You're incorrect that they could just buy the information, in this case, as well. That's a media-only exception, and only exists so the media's ability to hunt down stories wasn't hindered by a law intended to prevent corruption.
Which is clearly what this *is*. It's corruption of our system. It's the introduction of powerful outside influences that are contrary to the interests of America.

I play at Seals With Clubs. It's a pretty great site for lower and mid levels. Needs a bit more action. Come jump in.

Picked the wrong day to sell BTC. Maybe they noticed that you were selling low and assumed you're a risky fellow?
