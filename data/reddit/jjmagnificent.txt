Lol. Happy Hodldays 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:09:29
That’s one perspective. Personally I buy all the time.. why not? Buy a little here and there especially if you can, can’t predict anything 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:51
2.7k here but who’s counting lol

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:37:47
I believe that there is no cap for wire transfers vs bank transfers.. at least with Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:19
I heard Bitcoin is actually sentient A.I.

@_date: 2017-11-15 03:06:01
Hellllll nooo, Bitcoin doesn’t come without its expenses either.. there are all sorts of transaction fees n shit to take in consideration as well 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:58

@_date: 2017-11-10 19:52:44

Yes exactly, also transmuting emotional/mental patterns and blocks.  I’m a vibrational intuitive and spiritual alchemist. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:28:10
Do research first, as much as u can.. then see when u feel would be the best time to buy, there’s a lot going on at the moment

And? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:04:41
Not sure if you are being funny or not.. lol I wouldn’t just be going all in without an income 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:12:24
Maybe.. Maybe Not? Although I wouldn’t be surprised.. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:31:49

@_date: 2018-02-16 02:20:16
It’s not too late, would still buy in now rather than being even more pissed a week from now lol 
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:11:30
�� Alright Then I'll Hold You To That, Like I Said You Never Know. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:58:52

@_date: 2017-09-13 16:01:22

@_date: 2018-02-15 01:42:57
Congrats ! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:00
Of course it will go back up no need to panic seriously, this is nothing compared to the big scheme of things 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:53:17
Yes, just tried it earlier today. Did u figure out how to purchase bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:10:35
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:48:53
Lol it was just a question.. but to answer yours not simply based on just one persons response without research that's for sure 
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:15:04
I wire all my funds through Bank Of America to Gemini and never had a problem, and I’ve been doing over 10k wires. Although when cashing out I wire it from Gemini over to my Navy Federal Credit Union acct - no questions asked
