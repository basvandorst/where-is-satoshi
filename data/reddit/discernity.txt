Every year since 2009 has proven that Bitcoin is here to stay.  Whenever someone says "Bitcoin is here to stay" I get this visceral reaction to the effect of "Yes, and it goes without saying."  But I guess you have to understand Bitcoin to understand why it goes without saying.

That will change with uptake of OpenBazaar.

Withdrawn.  Thanks for the heads up.  Wish them the best.

Go ahead, just make sure you instantly replenish.

Had it not been for mainstream media, I would have discovered my appreciation of Bitcoin far sooner than I did.  This coverage is leaps and bounds better than what it used to be.  It will cause some to discover Bitcoin for the first time... perhaps even prompt some to read Satoshi's whitepaper, and then cry themselves to sleep and dream about the potential ramifications for weeks and months.

I actually think that differentiating Bitcoin (the network) from Satoshis (the unit of account) would be fabulous.  It would bring many more people into the fold because now they can afford to buy a bunch of them.

But they'll find out soon thereafter that Sats are a unit of account on the Bitcoin network.  I've always thought it would be better to have the unit of account have a different name than the network.  Plus, they will be able to afford and own a bunch of them, which is important psychologically to most ordinary people.

A similar approach that I use is: some day it will be extremely rare for anybody to own a full bitcoin.  This always gets juices flowing in newbs.
