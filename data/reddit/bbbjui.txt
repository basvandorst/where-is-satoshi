Read your own comment. It says you can’t put a finger on the time. This guy is saying 2-5 years or whatever. I can sit here and predict you will die one day. But I can’t say you will die in 2-5 years. Especially if I am just a programmer in the medical field not even a doctor.

A business cycle trough is a downturn. Calling it a crisis would be ridiculously hyperbolic.

Read my question. Am I a doctor if I write software for the medical industry? Consider the source. Don’t be a fool.

He heard from 5000 companies before he invested in those 10. Go out raise money for a company in SV and see for yourself how it works. I’ve done it twice. Once up to Series A and the second time just through angels.

Yes. You could be too if you had exposure to early deals. Here is how it works. You invest $500k in 10 companies. One returns you 1000x and 9 sink and fail. How much are you left with now? 990 times what you started with. Wrong 9/10 times, but the one you get right makes up for them all and many times more. Example is simplified.

Look at his portfolio. It shows he’s wrong 9/10 times.
