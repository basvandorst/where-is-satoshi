evasi0n was first thought to be a trojan because there was an unwanted tweak, from Cydia, from a default repository, that was only included in the Chinese version, until they fixed it.

You can't install Android on an idevice anymore. I also sold my iPhone 5s for a Nexus 5 and I'm much happier with it.

"are you saying you take the miner's tips? that's no way to run an exchange. what are these bitcoins? these are coinbase-bought! what if I were to tell all of the users that the tips go to you and not the miners!?!?"

I've never given an SSN to Coinbase yet I still buy/sell there.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:06:48

I was saying that I trust something because the US government has sort of "approved" it. Here, you're usually bound to see someone saying "Blah blah blah don't trust the government blah blah blah libertarians NSA blah blah" if you trust or believe in any word of government, even simply stating an entity is a company because the government says so.

They're all separate apps and you only need to sign up for one, signing up for more than one would just not make sense

But right now, with Bitcoin not being regulated/recognized by US govt, Coinbase is the best best and most legit. Remember, only bad code and security practices end up getting hacked.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:26:06
Real exchanges?
- Coinbase: real investor money (USD) by real investors that they can't afford to lose, real company according to US law (waiting to be bashed by keyboard warrior libertardians)
- kraken: isn't shady, very transparent, we know who runs it, on github, international
and those are just 2 of ~8 legitimate large exchanges
@_date: 2014-09-15 21:13:35
because that's stupid

iOS devices have a little mic icon in the bottom left of the keyboard and pressing it opens a siri-like thing where it just types what you say.

There used to be a thing back in iOS 3 or 2 where if you jailbroke you could 100% COMPLETELY unlock the bootloader, so you were able to run Android on it.

in paypal he can click like 2 buttons and it goes to his bank account then you could do a transfer 
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:33:06
Anything else would be more profitable if you were to later convert it into BTC

same here... I'm 14 and I have pretty extensive basic knowledge on how taxing, IRS, and the like work. seriously, by 14 most people should know how to do this...
and if you don't, why not ask your parents?

You're the one being ignorant. I'm sure you could tell them "I bought something digital and I sold something digital and I need you to tax it as a capital gain"
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:29:22
They are technically allowed to make it transfer US dollars. They could also have a web interface in which there, you could get BTC for it. This could also reduce any fee time if it works with an in-house system (but many bitcronies wouldn't like it)
