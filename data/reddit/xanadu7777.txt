I’ve really enjoyed buying the dips the past month or so. Each buy has been a good deal and inflated my portfolio w some extra dollars

watch if the range the dip is on seems to be holding, it’s nice to see it go a little sideways. watch for the upward corrections getting close to outside of that holding range, buy if it fluxes down again from that high or starts to show more upward momentum in a short period. and hope there isn’t another significant movement down ��. At that position though it’s my guess you still made a good deal given the future of BTC prices. 
Don’t listen to me though, I don’t know what I’m doing.
Edit: I don’t trade in any capacity; I buy low when I can and hold

Do not do that. If I remember correctly the contents of the boxes are often not insured or as secure as one would think.

I’m getting pretty good (read: lucky) at identifying local price floors, never more than ~100 off from the bottom when buying dips. This is fun.

When can we expect the 19 millionth coin? and what does the timeline of the last 3 million coins look like if the last coin will be mined in 2140?
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:20:27
we are downvoted for viewing the dip w optimism
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:24:19
Cash out half your stash hold the rest
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:51:01
lots of good deal buys made by smaller players the last few weeks. Good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:06:24
Fuck yeah buddy lots of winners this month
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:07:18
if it comes true seems like you should hold
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:06:43
Because it’s fun
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:22:24
Just bought more dip
@_date: 2019-10-19 22:44:27
It’s going to be an interesting time for BTC now as we approach and then move away from the halving. I’m trying to get as much coin at this price range while I can, while still having a regular budget in balance.
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:44:20
We are over 10k wow
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:15:52

@_date: 2019-10-23 03:44:06
What just happened in the crypto market? Sharp sharp drops
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:48:46
Jumped past 8k
@_date: 2019-10-19 16:44:07
doesn’t seem to break below 7.8k, need to get that paycheck in today to buy more dip. 
Even if it does break we are still for sure seeing &gt;7.8k in the future regardless.

@_date: 2019-12-16 19:23:20
First I’d be a little upset, then I would buy some goddamn dip.
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:49:02
Cold storage for all?
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:21:52
�� if it helps you feel better, all my purchases have gone red at this point. But I am holding through any and all turmoil.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:49:03
Just bought a reasonable amount of dip ����
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:06:03
