Just smile and wish them well; try to be polite explaining that you aren't going to invest your energy in their Kramer-esque scheme. Maybe use an excuse, like, I dunno, you're researching to write some imaginary book or some other kind of fake project that people will forget about. Then use that time to sit at home laughing at your friends struggling to bring their terrible idea to life, while preparing your best "I'm so sorry to hear your investment has not borne the fruits you have anticipated, let's go have some beer and cheer up" speech. Bammo. They learn to listen to you next time, and you don't get fucked working/investing on their doomed (DOOOMED!!) project, and you hopefully stay friends.

Yes, but the point I'm making is that the vast majority of people have no idea, and will be unwilling to take the time to learn, how to encrypt wallets or even run client software. For those people, should the banks jump in, they will have the *option* of letting the banks keep their money secure - which was the original purpose of banks to begin with. For most people, paying (in my opinion, outrageous) fees for this service is worthwhile - which is why most people don't keep their wealth sewed up in their mattress.
For what it's worth, I agree with you. The Cypriot thing is shaking people's already tattered faith in banks. But if banks started offering BTC services I would probably deposit a portion of what I have, just for the convenience of an ATM card, while keeping the lion's share elsewhere, safe from the banks.

It's going to be the most unexpected global grass-roots (for some reason I hate that label) movement of individuals and small businesses  embracing the technology; at the tipping point an independent post-national economy will begin to emerge.
At first it'll be small businesses like coffee shops and independent music labels. Then you'll see convenience stores and grocery stores accepting BTC (because at this point affordable custom hardware strictly for this purpose will be available). Somewhere around 2016, maybe a year earlier, credit unions and a few smaller banks will have BTC accounts with debit cards.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:26:16
Only if you consider the top of that bubble to be the mean, which would be incorrect. Before the bubble occurred the BTC had (approximately) parity with USD. After the crash it only took maybe a month or two (guessing here, can't pull up charts right now) to return to said value.

If I was running Mt Gox, I would clone and split up the site so that there were different exchanges under the Mt Gox brand. So there'd be Mt Gox Red, Mt Gox Green, Mt Gox Blue, and so on  and distribute the members evenly amongst them. And they'd all run independently off different servers so that an outage doesn't affect everybody.
Of course the best solution would be for more people to use other exchanges because we're trying to decentralize things.

The potential impact is not nearly so much as it woulda been a year ago, or two years ago. Silk Road is how I found out about bitcoin, but now bitcoin is like a gangsta going legit. A year from now, if everything goes well and maybe *the killer app* (likesay major banks selling/supporting bitcoin), Silk Road will be a drop in the bucket.

Forgive my ignorance, but wouldnt these be easily counterfeited? I mean I could print off a fake paper wallet and tell some poor schlub "Oh, yuh, there's 0.25 BTC on there all right." They might be ok for personal storage, but seem dodgy for trade. Or am I missing something here?

I think he's rounding and/or exaggerating a wee bit, but coins were at 15ish just a couple months ago.

Yeah, but then folks would see the dip as a buying opportunity, and it'll bounce back up somewhere. I'm sure a lot of people here would go into **Extreme Turbo Buy Mode** if coins were suddenly going for $10.

It's vaguely tragic buying things with BTC. If I bought a sprocket for 5btc a couple years ago, sure, I enjoyed that sprocket. But I would have enjoyed having $900 a lot more. I could buy a nice plasma TV for the price of my sprocket!

As someone (by sheer luck, not wisdom) who sold at $28 in the early days, these spikes are discouraging me from buying back in. Maybe this isn't an empty bubble, but considering how much I made (and nearly lost, more importantly) on the Big Bubble long ago, I couldn't see myself as a new guy wanting to adopt when the price is spiking like this.

I once was in terrible credit card debt. Did I kill myself? No, I went bankrupt. Now I have no credit, no debt, and a positive net worth of whatever a 1998 Chevy Lumina is worth (approx. $600). Being broke isn't the end of the world; 99% of everybody has more or less jack. You just need to readjust your fuckin' attitude towards life. You don't need a fucking Land Rover to be happy. Go play with your dog, or have a beer with friends, go to your Mom's for dinner. Happiness is found in *living your fuckin' life*, not in your 401k.
Wealth is a form of security for most people. They pile up a hoard of coins and say, "This is my safety net. This means I will always have food to eat and a roof over my head." It's a good feeling, to feel secure. But if you lost every dollar, it's an almost sure thing that you would get through it, you'd solve the problem, and you'd be ok in the long run.
Me? I work a full time job and I live one paycheck to the next. I got my ass hanging out the window. Sure, I'd love to have something to fall back on, and maybe if I get a better job I'll open an RSP. But I don't spend my days fraught with worry over what might happen in the future. I trust myself - future me's *got this.* And that allows present me to be more *in* the present, which improves my relations with others, makes me more focused on the job, and keeps my anxiety level down. I'm happier.

Look for a box called "Pending Trades" (I think that's what it's called). The portion of your coin that didn't sell yet should be there.
If you're in a hurry to sell the rest, you cancel and re-list your coin at a slightly lower rate. Or wait to see if someone buys it.

At this point I don't think it can be killed. Faith in the BTC as an investment vehicle may be shaken a little, but as a payment system it's really beginning to take off. I don't want to say it's too big to fail, but more and more people are beginning to see BTC's promise. Things could get very interesting soon.

It could be bad for a growth based economy; however, people need to eat, they have to pay their rent and utilities. Perhaps a need-based economy (I'm talking out of my ass here) will become normal.
People are always going to pursue what they want. Now they might wait until they can actually afford it? Of course, this will slow growth; but at this point does human society need to grow so much? The rate of growth in human society has long been declared unsustainable. Maybe deflation is the answer to this.

Should bitcoin gain mass acceptance, I'm sure banks would gladly be willing to provide their services (for a small fee). I mean, yeah, the point of bitcoin is that we don't need banks, but some people simply lack the technological know-how to run wallet software, etc. I mean, my Mom is smart at everything but technology - you've never seen so many browser toolbars.
