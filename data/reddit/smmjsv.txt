I believe satoshi if not dead already will reveal himself onpy when the last btc is mined. An if csw is the real satoshi then why would anyone in their right mind follow someone so careless according to the rumors that satoshi may have lost his private keys.  I mean isnt that the golden rule keep your friends close, your private keys closer. " if my buddy started a company, lost everything from own stupidity then asked me to join the next venture, would i knowing the previous results??"
