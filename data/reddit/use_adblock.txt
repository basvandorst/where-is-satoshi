Well I have other friends who bought in November and have since left the space. No "HODLing" for them either. Just buy and sell for a quick buck

HODL isn't the groupthink you're just in the reddit echo chamber. The only other people I know that own Bitcoin use it for usenet payments and for buying weed off the darknet, not for "HODLing" or any sort of investment.

Well, considering the government covers their losses if they become insolvent, I don't see why they should.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:53:13
The "cover their losses" was in reference to the bailouts, but I suppose you're right that in the typical case, they simply just fail.
However, the government covers the deposits but is ultimately funded by the taxpayer, so you could argue it's no different than the people covering their own losses. I wasn't OP so I'm not arguing that half of profit is reasonable or that even any percent of profit is reasonable, I can just understand the position that people "gambling" with our money should probably give us a cut of the profits. I get that they provide plenty of services (keeping money safe, facilitating electronic payments, etc.) but they also make absurd profits.

Assuming you are making any normal purchase, it is not economically feasible to perform a 51% attack to double spend it. So you just accept 0 conf

Poisson is memoryless. The expected time until next block is always 10 minutes.

Even if this vulnerability was used, the tether itself was not double spent. Imagine the exchange had a single customer who deposited 5000 USDT twice, their account has 10000 USDT, but when they try to withdraw, the exchange doesn't have 10000 USDT to actually give them.

It's not an exploitable coin, the exchange code is broken.

I always wonder who upvotes most of this garbage.

No. 300% growth would put us barely above our previous high, so the chart would look nothing like that.

Yes you're right that in specific instances, prices can be manipulated up and down by a few market participants. I was just pointing out the fact that, in general, market cap and real volume are highly correlated.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:20:15
Actually it does. If there are fewer market participants (less total money in the market) then the price is lower in general.
