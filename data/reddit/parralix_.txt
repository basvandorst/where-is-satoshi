Try localbitcoins, it’s a decent P2P exchange.

Googling it brings you to the bitcoin website first result and don’t tell me paper wallets are obselete that is a ridiculously closed-minded statement to make. Paper wallets are the safest form of wallet.

I wouldn’t ever suggest keeping your money on an exchange, even if you plan on selling “soon”. 3 BTC is a hell of a lot compared to many people’s holdings, myself included, and risking that wouldn’t be sensible.
To make it easier, google “bitcoin paper wallet generator” and follow the steps to create a BTC address. After this, download the Electrum client (I recommend this) and import the wallet you just created. Also, make sure to **make a backup**.
People will probably say Coinbase is fine and to realistically not worry and yes, it *probably* won’t cause any problems, but once funds are gone they’re gone.

To keep it simple but make it different, have you though about displaying other coins that are similar the user might be interested in also? Could do some price action comparisons too if you wanted.

Rule of thumb: free things (especially too good to be true) are scams

Not sure if you’re from the US, but Coinbase have recently released a setup for transferring balances on their website to PayPal. Other countries are meant to be supported throughout 2019.
