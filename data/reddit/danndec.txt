Servus! Von wo bist du aus Österreich? Ich bin nämlich aus Wels. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:30:02
Of course that counts, my friend! :) nice to hear from an american. Gmunden is sick, isnt it? It‘s how you would imagine Austria to look like as a foreigner. The city is not far away from where i live. Take care man!

Thank you! And I can withdraw without fee from both gdax to coinbase and coinbase to bank account?
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:48:10
Upvote well deserved, Sir.

@_date: 2018-03-31 10:25:46
For cashing out?
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:15:03
Could you please give me a step-by-step instruction how to buy fee-less from Coinbase? I already transfered EURO to my Eurowallet. What now? Now I just buy directly from Coinbase or do I transfer to GDAX (how?)? Thank you in advance!
(I already paid a few hundred euros fees on another exchange. That's stupid, but I didnt know about other possibilities.)

When you realize cryptocurrency isn’t just about making money. It’s about replacing money.
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:51:07
have you already gotten some donations or do I have to be the first one?
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:40:23
Do they accept crypto?

@_date: 2018-04-02 17:30:29
Exactly! However: in order to pull out my funds I need access in the first place. Which they don't want to give me. SCAM!
@_date: 2018-04-07 10:17:57
That's.. not good. I think. Is it?
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:21:52
