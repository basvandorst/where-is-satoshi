Never said there was a law of economics. There is more demand when good news arises, *usually*. That more people buy when news arises. It's quite common in stocks. It's not guaranteed to happen, but it does and it logically makes sense. Here is some great Bitcoin news that went public and suddenly there are more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2016-04-29 09:06:31
I was wondering what other dominant factors lead to the price drop that day. It recovered a bit, at the time of writing, I was shocked at the sudden flux of sellers vs buyers.
@_date: 2016-04-28 04:06:04
No I haven't heard of that. Thanks.

But you're not the guy who has the issue. 
If the guy who has the issue asks, thats a different story. A company dealing with fiat can't just willy-nilly answer questions online about customer issues to anyone who asks like If I had a bank deny my check, you shouldn't be able to ask the bank why they denied it. Only me and the guy who wrote the check should be able to. Then maybe we'll tell you when we find out :P

Here's my question.  How do you attempt to give the 'same' bitcoin to another person?
Your wallet has 5BTC
So you initiate a transaction with Sally first for 5 BTC
Then you go to send to George. How can you if your wallet is going to report 0?

Funny enough with all my time trading and mining BTC, I don't think I've ever spent any in a transaction besides Gyft (which I use a ton)
I didn't find the person selling lemonade (I dont even know how old the chalk sign was because I think I remember seeing it a few days ago but never noticed the BTC symbol), but if I did, I would've totally bought like... 5 limonades.

I will never order from Tiger Direct again and I encourage everyone else to not either. Send emails to tweets to newegg or microcenter or frys to encourage them to take bitcoin to combat tiger direct.
They were my first computer parts order but will certainly not be having my last (or next or ever again )
Back when the GTX 690 came out, I ordered one of the first ones available from TD. After 2 days in UPS, it got lost. The status would never update. I called UPS and they said to call tiger Direct. Tiger Direct told me to call UPS. UPS told me it was lost in transit and that Tiger Direct had to file for an investigation. Tiger Direct would not do it claiming that I had to do it. I had to ping pong between Tiger Direct and UPS for days before Tiger Direct finally took the responsibility for talking to UPS. 
Imagine the time that took on the phone. 30 - 60 minute conversations that were prolonged and required me to call the other person. Passing the blame.
UPS gets back to me and told me it would take 2 weeks to complete the investigation.  No way was I waiting that long. I told Tiger Direct that I wanted a refund and would wait for a new GTX690 to be available.  By then they were sold out but then the 6990 came out and I wanted that. The lady on the phone actually got nasty with me. She sneered. It went something like "this isn't our fault it was ups who lost it so you can't hold us accountable.' I said I understand that ups was the one who lost it but I can't be waiting on something that may never be found in which case you'll have to send me another one ANYWAY. And of course I shouldn't be the one communicating with UPS. She veered back and very nasty, I swear it sounded like something recorded from mean girls. I couldn't help but curse and say wtf do you mean you can't refund me and she hung up.
The next rep I got on the phone wasn't too helpful either but eventually got me the refund. Then I went to newegg to get a 6990 because it was available over the 690. 
Tldr tiger Direct would have preferred me to wait 2 weeks for UPS to tell me my order was lost rather than refund me and let me order a replacement. Which would've had needed to be done anyway. And they were nasty and unhelpful about it as humanly possible. We're talking over 10 hours on the phone. Easily

I had Microsoft do it to me recently to about replacing my Xbox One. They sent a replacement to Texas, and I live in New York. They told me to handle it with FedEx. I was really thrown off by it.
*It doesn't make it okay though*. At least I went back to Microsoft and they understood the issue and got it resolved. They didn't blow me off the second time yet alone the FIFTH time I had to with Tiger Direct. And if I really pushed the button, I'm sure they would've called off the replacement without asking twice. No one really gave me an attitude back.

@_date: 2014-03-08 05:38:50
Yeah I was with gox since 2010-ish because it was the easiest exchange to get USD money in and out of for me.
When I heard that it was taking weeks to get money out of it around September, I immediately started to look elsewhere. Then when BTC hit 200 in October, I sold 10BTC worth (2k). At first I hated myself for it because BTC skyrocketed to 1k within a week or so. But I didn't mind waiting. BTC has always been an experimental investment for me, and I've made enough to be content either way.
I emailed gox support every other week after the new years, and they would always give the same response. I never imagined the exchange closing and never getting that 2k. Even if it took a year, I was okay with that (in an angry way). But at the same time it was better than possibly losing the 10k it could have been.
Anyone who says the signs were obvious and hate on victims clearly haven't been in BTC long enough. Out of everyone that came and went, gox stood and it did have its fair share of issues but they were really good while the going was good. They sent me free Yubikeys, I had an astronomical BTC buying/selling limit that I would only dream of hitting, and I got money in and out when I wanted to up until that last transaction.
Its a shame, and we deserve our money. Especially the ones who paid high prices. To insult or do any kind of "blaming" or "told you so" at this point is silly, does nothing but hurt the community, and side step the problem - gox customers should get justice just as much as anyone who was supporting some new exchange on the market that got robbed.

Just short of making dozens of ATT withdrawls (which has quite the limit), international bank wires are like 50+ bucks. I rather pay $12 for the ATT to give me 1.2k
Bitcoin no problem.
And the funniest thing is that I'm less than 6 hours from home. It's rediculous. And the WORST is that none of my banks let me do wires over the phone or online. Have to be in the branch physically. Fuck that noise.
The only issue with bitcoin over the ATM besides the limit is the time. It takes a while to get funds from my banks or cash into bitcoin. And then bitcoin into cash. About 2 weeks to and from. And even then I'm still not entirely satisfied with bitcoins recent comings to keep it all in BTC. That and I can't pay rent with BTC yet xD

Not at all new.
I've seen news where people on Fox make a quote about BTC and the price quickly shot up within the hour. Or similar. Something like MS adopting BTC as a payment option validates it as a currency, and creates ton of news about it to people who wouldn't have otherwise known about BTC. Seeing something like BTC logo on the MS store is very hard to miss, or the many news sites its shown up. I just find it weird.
In retrospect, maybe I'm "new" to predicting market values and such but I'm curious as to why the price has been negative after the news. But not around here.

@_date: 2015-01-14 23:49:32
Except it was very profitable for awhile. My issue was primarily that I was too shortsighted and ditched a lot of coin before it skyrocketed up to 1000. And when it was at 1k, I held too long. I basically continually did the inverse of what was ideal for me to do. I didn't lose money, but I certainly squandered the opportunity.
The only real big ordeal I got nothing out of was the gox incident. I lost a bit in there, I couldnt get anything out for over 5 months and then poof. Went dark. My biggest regret.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:11:58

BFL definitely mined with everyone's equipment first and they completely fucked with everyone's orders with their lying timelines and shit.
But, I loved the quality of my 60GH machine compared to KNC's giant metal box that looked like it had been thrown/kicked around, and also had no USB support option.
So while KNC manufactured on time, were a little more transparent, I prefered the quality of my BFL miner itself in the end when directly compared to KNC one I got. And fuck KNC for not honoring preorders on the site. They refused to take my money after a bankwire got delayed over the weekend of Thanksgiving 2013 too.

Retconned? Lol
Its a classic example of taking a serious issue and covering it up by refocussing on the actions of a minority. Proceeding to make stuff up as you go in order to convince something like... 'retconning' the origin of an issue. 
I dont even like the whole gamergate thing in general. I just really despise sleezy journalism tactics. And whether the actions of Zoey Quinn were a thing or not doesnt matter. Or if the origin was 'retconned' lol The press have done rediculous shady stuff over the years in gaming completely unsupervised. And of course, the whole topic got swept under the rug.

Got into it because at the time, I wanted to play in stocks but it was too menacing for me. So much terminology, you needed to do credit checks, most sites needed you to have a minimum opening on your account, it was all just confusing and I wasn't comfortable with it. Maybe now I'd be way more open to it, but I really wanted something I could just chuck a few $50 at here and there and play with it for kicks.
Not comfortable with regular stocks as opposed to shady-as-fuck Bitcoin? Yeah, that sounds assbackwards but at the time, I did ALOT of folding which is basically the equivalent of distributive computing for charity as opposed to profit. So when someone approached me about BTC mining in January 2011, I thought the idea to try to both mine and trade was an interesting one. And it has been. I love the premise of BTC and only wish I had done more to help develop the community and the way we use it instead of trading/mining.
I sucked, and continue to suck, at trading. I was well off with mining up for several years, and then I caught up with college graduation and an awesome internship so I squandered those profits big time. But, the trading equalized everything out. I'm happy I got into Bitcoin for what I got into it for. Will continue to check it out for a bit.
tl;dr - I got into it to get rich before it was cool to get into it to get rich.

Note they are accepting Paypal payments soon. It has been confirmed on numorous accounts.
To imply that BFL would "take the money and run" is ignorant because unlike Bitcoinica, BFL is an actual business that is established and has delivered actual working hardware in the past. 
Plenty of people have multiple mini rig BFL machines, need I spell out how much those cost?
Unlike Bitcoinica as well, thi is actual currency and product we're refering to. You dont simply take Zhou Thong to court for bitcoin stealing. You can easily take BFL to court as a business in the US taking your money. Their products arent just for bitcoin too.
Major differences.
Also a longtime member of the bitcointalk community just scored a job at BFL when he realized he worked locally. A business planning to run away with the goods doesn't simply do that,
The whole "BFL conspiracy criminal" stuff is nonsense. Not delivering a product completely up to specs is one thing, but "taking the money and running" is completely other ballpark that will never happen. And heaven forbid it does, this again is nothing comparable to Bitcoinica, its a business that can be tracked down and pulled into court. They have s buyer's protection too, you can ask for a refund at any moment if you feel that their release is not up to par when the time comes to ship.
@_date: 2012-07-11 06:20:37
The authenticator itself?
What the authenticator does is run a unique algorithm that is based on the code given by the site sometimes in the form of a QR code. The authenticator itself has no info about your account, just the unique code tied to it upon creation. That key is created, you put it into the wbsote, and the website knows that the number corresponds to the original unique code through the algorithm. The website knows that the passwor changes on time limits.
At least thats my basic understading.
No emails or data is transmitted at all that Im sure of.
@_date: 2012-07-12 06:12:35
Very awesome response. Thank you.
I like how you looked at it as faith as opposed to the actual power.
I have my number preorder in, its just a matter of sending off the money. Like you mention, the only thing stopping me from sending the money is faith in BFL. I don't honestly expect the BFL SC Single to do the supposed 40Gh/s. I suspect 20% less realistically, worst case scenario being 50% but I doubt the latter entirely. The last gen Singles didn't come out with the initial Mh/s rate reported.
I wish that BFL would give us a sign. Some kind of info. A video, a photo, something that confirms that yes - these devices are well into development and very close to production. Just words don't cut it.
According to emails referenced on Bitcointalk.org, if the release date shifts 60 days past October, full refunds are garunteed. So if they end up releasing TOO late, I'm not worried about that all much. It's just whether or not, like you said, the profits during those first few weeks will cut it. And I'm kind of leaning toward trusting that.
@_date: 2012-09-12 22:49:50

@_date: 2015-04-02 10:10:41
Maybe I misread what you just said, but I think you missed the point.
The issue is not about freezing assets vs taking stuff. The issue is OP is stating that this is about doing something like donating to Snowden and its not. Donating to Snowden is unrelated.


Did Snowden perpetrate a cyber attack yet? Until he does, this has nothing to do with him or anyone else. 
AND - donating money to snowden doesn't get you involved, its about his assets. So the money that ends up in his accounts gets frozen. Not your stuff.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:14:22
This is so false. Reread it and what Obama has stated.


Freezing assets of the individual has nothing to do with you suddenly aiding and embedding. The OP of that thread made it entirely up. Nowhere does it state that. And they certainly don't take anything from you. Worst case scenario is that they freeze your account(s) too, in which it would be resolved because oh look - you were just donating. No one is taking anyone's shit.
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:15:45
You've definitely entered a billing address.
One week I took a trip to Hawaii. 2 of my credit cards immediately got declined at a shop to my embarrassment. And I live in the US to boot. 
I've also had a debit card decline on a Chinese website ordering some game import. I had to call them up because they entirely locked up my card anywhere I used it.
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:05:50
I agree that there are definitely over statements in Bitcoin but nothing here has been overstated. 
OP had to fight with his credit card company for shipping to the US while living in Taiwan with the billing address before. To some stupid extent the was more than just a phone call. Meanwhile the BTC transaction was a click and done, no question transaction. 
That's not an overstatement. That's a reality.

But that's the WHOLE POINT. For me, it's more likely I go on vacation than for someone to steal my CC and pin to be able to attempt to do a whole 600 grocery purchase in another state. Especially without me noticing. 
For OP, he's shipping to another country that's not his billing address. Any time he shops Newegg or somewhere that doesn't ship to Taiwan. Probably common
To have to call the credit card company, sit on hold, answer all kinds of identity and security questions, just to go on vacation or do anything when you location changes even temporarily, is an annoying old school unnecessary process. Its another cog and to do checklist. Its a roadblock if you forget. 
That's the point of OP. The BTC transaction was simple, no questions asked, no bullshit process. 
I'm not arguing the merit of fraud protection. I'm arguing how stupid fraud protection can flip on for often small transactions (not even your 600 exaggerated theft example) for the wrong reasons meanwhile his BTC transaction was no bs and quick. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 20:09:41

Do yourself a favor. Get your head out of your ass. I just explicitly mentioned that I myself have went to Hawaii, in the god damn US if you didn't know, and had issues with......

It doesn't. 
For example, bfl has been claiming that for the last 2 weeks they've been shipping singles and little singles from June 23rd which was opening for preordering. That means a lot was ordered. 
On that website, there are only a handful listed. Meanwhile, there are supposedly thousands. It makes sense too. But you can't use that website to track it because it's missing at least 3/4 of them. 
It's not official. You have to manually sign up for that list. Most people who ordered probably don't bother with Bitcoin talk and such

Well to me this is relevant. It's why I got into bitcoin.
I was looking at my first serious savings account and the rates alll sucked. Beyond doing a 10 year bond, as a college student, it would've been worthless.
So I invested into bitcoin 3 years ago. Not even counting the mining I do, the investment putting my savings account money accrued over 30 times the amount I would've gotten with some shitty bond. In 1/4 the time.
Instead of depositing my checks into my savings, I deposit them into a BTC market. Sure it's not guaranteed to increase, but isn't it still a risk to put into a terrible restricted bond or account for years and get 0 return? maybe not as much as investing but a risk none the less
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:54:49

At a super extra long slow rate.  And the only reason they are 'ahead' is because of upgrades. Not everyone upgraded, so there are FAR fewer little singles
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:36:08
I don't follow. 
Say there are 100 orders on June 23rd not accounted for on that list. Say bfl has only shipped what is shown on that list and is still 100 behind. The people for June 24th and 25th will be like 'oooo it's our time!' and it isn't by far. 
It's better than nothing I suppose you are right. But all things considered, it would be 10x better if bfl just told us instead where they are number wise. It isn't hard. Or at least a queue system. I've seen companies do it before. You throw in your order number 'ur at  we're on

Dont get me wrong. I completely agree with everything you wrote and you are correct overall, Bitcoin is not a garunteed investment.
But my point being is that what you just described can be said about any currency in the history of ever, the same risks and dangers. Especially with people in very high up places with the keys to the car. That says something about Bitcoin's viability as a serious currency today and that it would be silly to think it would all come crashing down tomorrow.

LabRat did get his asic infront of everyone else because he was a moderator for BFL. It isn't something he hid I think.

@_date: 2013-11-29 07:50:11
As I said, there is a higher risk but at this point 'every penny' is nonsense. People are way to invested now to let bitcoin fall that far for it to be a wipe out risk.
Can it half in price? Sure if something really bad news drops about some government trying to stop it in a serious way. But the likelihood of that is very little, and one can argue that it would drive price up instead.
The only time you could argue that you can lose every penny is if there is a cryptoscare. Someone breaks the system or claims to. That's when BTC breaks. But the likelihood of that is about as likely as whatever bank you have a savings account closing due to an economic depression. Making the equivalency of risk highly moot.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:28:12
BFL should take a look at this.

people paid upfront a year ago, and still haven't gotten a product.
They said expected October back then. Then December. Then January. Then March. Then April. Then June/July. Its now August.
2 weeks - 2 weeks - 2 weeks. They've said that at ~least~ 3 times.
They've promised that they would have double the staff. They were going to 'up the production scale' and 'work weekends.' That was back in early April or May if I recall.
Production didn't begin until end of June really. And it was a SNAIL'S pace. They made it seem like they would release products in a timely manner. Exact opposite. They released with the performance that everyone who invested had feared. And then some.
They release "news" in a broken faucet format. Months without any real work. If you call the recent "shipping updates" consistent, then right there you have little understanding of the problem at hand. Jody's "shipping updates" consist of "Yeah so, we're still on July 23rd for singles" for **an entire month**. No reason why. No numbers. No nothing. What was the hold up? They never gave any justification. No time span, nothing about where they were at.
Then theres the trashing. The lovely trashing. You have BFL_Josh on bitcointalk spitting on people, making absolutely trashy blanket statements about the community, and being an asswipe. Completely dodging burning questions that needed to be answered. And examples of this. Along with those "consistent shipping reports", Jody leaves snark ass comments that are worse than the comments in her updates with almost every other update.
BFL_Jody almost tried to get out of shipping Little Singles to customers in their queue. Back in June, they weren't shipping Little Singles. There are reports that she replied to questions on the forum that **Little singles wouldn't be shipped in the order queue originally upgraded from as promised**. Denying any kind of promise to customers, who wouldn't have made the upgrade if not true. Outright LIED. They immediately went back on that lie a week later and suddenly LS started to ship. Yay?
Then theres the whole refunding thing. Which is pure bullshit. They have had our money for a year +, and then when people are upset that its taken them this long to move products **and they still are having issues delivering** they should be able to refund. This isn't just about difficulty rising. This is about being stuck with...
* No proper updates on whats wrong
* Months of lying and "guestimations"
* Having to SCOUR a crappy web forum for news. WTF?
* Dealing with Josh's bullshit
* All this insider nonsense, like with LabRat and the other shenanigans
* The stupid BTC donation idiocy that wasn't real
* Jalapenos getting pushed out with nothing else getting done for a MONTH. A bloody MONTH.
* **This is twice BFL has done this** They did this with FGPAs too. They promised the second time they would deliver. And they havent, its gotten ~worse~
And this one tops the cake in my opinion. As a person who really tried to back BFL when they started the ASIC stuff, as someone who gave BFL the total benefit of the doubt since June 2012 all the way to Feb 2013, I'm particularly appalled with how **unapologetic and arrogant** BFL is.
Its one thing for a company to royally fuck up. Its another thing to royally fuck up MULTIPLE times. Its a WHOLE other thing to royally fuck up multiple times **and then try to act like they didn't.** That everything is "fine and dandy." That "they were actually on top."
Have you ever looked at company rivalries? Big and small alike? Even when they surprisingly, and entertainingly, throw rocks at each other directly - rarely do they ever do this kind of shit when they're being burdened with issues? Did you see Sony try and stab Microsoft when Sony had gotten hacked or even after for example? Its a rather far out example, but its interesting to see professionalism in some kind of format. When a business is under fire, you combat the fire. *Not start new ones*
Avalon shipped first. Sure, say what you will about Avalon. They're getting pretty shady too, might even be worse than BFL at this point. But Avalon beat BFL to the punch, and BFL still acts like that didn't happen. They continue to sling shit too. Any time BFL actually releases some kind of press statement or responds to its customers (once in a blue moon) they say really idiotic things like how they're the best around town and how they're producing SO much, all this hashrate nonsense. Meanwhile, they simple haven't and aren't.
**Where are the apologies?** Where are the "hey, here's something nice we're doing for our initial orders"?
Anyone who actually says WELL WE GOT SOME COOL 25% OFF COUPONS *needs to shut the fuck up before finishing that thought*. Because if you use that coupon, you're locked into a device that won't get to your doorstep before December if you're lucky and there is DEFINITELY new devices on the way. I wouldn't be surprised at all if BFL has been using all this time on their asses to make a new product thats way better.
If you look around other industries, there are companies and startups that deliver so much more quickly, so much more politely, and so much more professionally. ASICs and even BTC in general is certainly niche and kind of uncharted territory so its not a fair comparison really. But its certainly not an excuse to be a bunch of assholes to people who GAVE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR AGO AND STILL HAVENT RECEIVED ANYTHING. Some aren't even close~~~~ to receiving it. I'm not even that mad about my order, I'm furious about other people's orders.
The minirig people? The ones that invested the most and took on the BIGGER risk upfront that more or less made this whole thing possible for BFL? Completely shafted. I'm adamant about how shitty BFL is now. If I had gotten a minirig, I'd have requested a refund awhile back and if not allowed to I would've layered up. Forget this Paypal support nonsense. After about 2 "no refund for you" bullshit, I'd have gone straight to the punch. They deserve a lot more than some shitty ceramic mug if they're getting it at this point.
Oh, and the lack of PSU nonsense is even more absurd. I don't even want to get into that. What company can't get their hands on a generous amount of cheapo power supplies is beyond me. Coming from someone who has done this before, it takes a single phone call and some money to get 1,000 350W PSU bricks done in *no time*. With the way BFL is moving who def need more than 1000 at this stage can't even get more than 100 in the their office at any time. Which is rediculous, why wasn't this sorted out AGES ago? Power issues with the boards back in May should've been immediately taken care of dammit. You can order bulk months in advance!
This is just the TIP of the iceberg. If you think this is a long rant, imagine if I put all the intricate details in.
**Every little bit of hate is completely fucking justified. In fact, there isn't enough of it.**
There was a fantastic post on their shitty web forums back in February that more or less predicted all of this bullshit, which I will link if I can find it again. The point of the post was that not enough customers were either trying to refund or threatening to refund that BFL was getting too comfortable with the money they already had in their pocks. In other words, there was no fire under their asses to get anything done. Now people are demanding refunds. Now people are getting Paypal to fuck their shit up. Now they're moving a little faster. Coincidence? FUCK NO

Yeah, and we're a pretty big CS campus ironically. It angers a lot of students. Some distros kinda work, others don't. I've seen people hack the Cisco VPN client to work on some distros but I'm not too familiar with all of them. And it also depends on Wifi vs ethernet too. They're actually separate systems and it just sucks entirely.
They're 'aware' of the issue and for example, they retooled the Wifi to be more accessible for different operating systems and devices. Like, more tablets can get on the network now because you don't need the Cisco VPN if you're on Android or iOS anymore. But gaming consoles can't because they're not 802.1x capable. Its just half assed. Like, when I first came on campus, you had to have the campus version of McAfee enterprise installed. They just recently ditched it but its still not.... all there.
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:46:50
exactly. Cisco's NAC handles it automatically, but it authenticates first and its not really possible to just "spoof" if you can't install it on your OS or the network doesn't understand what OS is being used.
When Windows 8 first came out, I couldn't go online. Then, they finally approved Windows 8 onto the network BUT I was a moron and downloaded the Media center addon for free at the time. Apparently, that changes the Operating System identifier in Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8 Pro Media Center and the network would just reject me entirely. I had to diagnose with networking and they had to add me to the exception list. I tried hard to spoof it back to normal Windows 8 Pro through registry with no luck. Otherwise I would've had to reinstall :(

yeah thats what pisses me off more than josh.
Every blog she makes that is more "progress", she makes these rude comments that don't contribute anything other than to spark more nonsense.
They all act like they're doing a great job. Jody even goes as far to say "but we're up to task for shipping now" and its getting done.
It hasn't gotten done for the past year~. They haven't been up to the task to ship for the past half year~. They're not up to task and never WILL be up to task.
It infuriates me every time I reread it.
@_date: 2013-07-08 18:38:55
I would if people spoke up more. Its quite annoying to see for every BFL annoyance there is about a dozen more people that support them for some reason.
Time after time. There was a nice post awhile back in January that was like "I urge you people [the customers] to not let BFL slide with further delays without questioning". They all let them slide.
@_date: 2013-10-22 06:21:15
No thank you guys. Really makes game design accessible and the constant stream of updates is alwys exciting.
I would not have pegged scirra as someone to pickup bitcoins which is even more amazing.
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:49:15
aw shit. that sounds terrible for me.
I'm on school campus where only Windows, Ubuntu, and OSX can get online. And worse yet - we can't get the IP of the device remotely. I'm going to have a bad time...

BFL has trashed its customers and the bitcoin community for far too long. 
There are people that sit in their shoutbox all high and mighty sucking up to them, but meanwhile the rest of the entire freakin bitcoin community and their own customers have it out for BFL right now.
Its sickening how they refuse to give out information about what the hell they were doing yet since the beginning they were all "we're such a transparent company! we're letting our customers know whats going on, labrat and XXX are going to visit and take pictures!"
Meanwhile, nothing got done, the information from the visits were useless, they refuse to let us know numbers, they're giving out these shitty minirigs, they're banning people off their forum, Josh is cursing out people on bitcointalk, Jody is making up excuses and talking smack on her 'blog', the company has no direction.

After the explosion on the bitcointalk forum, I'm shocked he's still there and still allowed to talk as he does. Thats about 1/2 their consumer base he insulted.

I have one of these babies on preorder, early July to be exact.
While I am extremely pissed and was on the verge of getting my money back/canceling, this looks promising. If they delay again past March 8th - I might have to consider again.
@_date: 2013-07-08 15:08:00
I mean the supposed bans/deletions from both forums and the downvotes clearly states it for you. And you wonder why?
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:18:44
Basically, they're at September orders of Jalapenos.
They're only at June 23rd for singles and lsingles. And who knows where for minirigs.
Scam artists. I rather have 12 jalapenos at a higher cost of 1 single 60gh/s machine about 2-3 months earlier. Its such bullshit.

Student studying Computer Science and Game Design chiming in here.
I'm a programming guy and while Construct 2 is not "programming" in the strictest sense... its a drag-n-drop programming style if you will... its still very powerful and very intuitive. You can get pretty much ANYONE to learn how to make awesome games in Construct 2.
I highly recommend Construct 2 to anyone looking to make awesome games or even interactive web applications. Its so easy to port the games to other platforms and the web browser is universal for almost any device. One click and it nearly works on tons of different devices.
Im super excited it now supports Bitcoin as payment. Go Scirra!

If I see 2013 - MILEY'S BUTT TWERKING one more time, I'm going to rip my nuts off.
If this is how we define a year in history, then we're truly doomed and I cannot believe I had any hope for redemption anyway. Naive I am.
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:15:02
I think you misread. 
He meant stalling for max profits in that people will continue to order asics from them. Not that they mine for themselves. 
If they keep stalling, the network difficulty doesn't go sky high and people keep placing preordering. It looks like they're shipping so it's all okay and still a good investment for new orders
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:31:05
I wish I knew how. We have to use Cisco NAC and I've found it impossible to bridge or proxy any connections through the PC with NAC running.

Better response than anything BFL has done in the past 2 years.
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:32:29
And that's why you got banned/deleted. It's a threat. 
I'm all for lining up against BFL but it's this exact kind of comment that belittles our side and empowers theirs. This gives Josh rhyme and reason to act like a little shit. I can't blame him in that case. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 12:19:20
Ordered early July, told October or December at latest. 
Then told January. 
Then March. 
Then may. 
Then maybe end of April. 
Then may/June. 
Now it's past the 1 year mark? And they've had my money and everyone else's since day 1.
Humanly possible? Of course it is. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:31:07
We have to wait for updates. They don't believe the information about where they are in shipping is important for us to know. 
Their words.
