I have reached out to them, hopefully they can recover it for me

They've managed to reach a surprising number of people despite it exhibiting obvious signs of being a scam... At first I thought that it was so obvious that there was no point in writing about but as you can see it's not so obvious for the average Joe. ESPECIALLY when so much easy money is 'promised'.

I disagree, if they have a negative experience from OneCoin, it will most definitely effect their future perception of Bitcoin. Keep in mind the main target audience are those who are less educated, especially about BTC/Blockchain. Also why not help out someone if you can?

thanks, made the correction.
I would agree about the publicity part except I'm sure most people on this subreddit is somewhat familiar with Bitcoin or Blockchain. Also the title is very negative for OneCoin so I don't think it will lead to any good publicity for them.

I would like to clarify that I am not getting paid or compensated in anyway to promote Yours. I am doing so because they are building a monetization platform the RIGHT way. I provided the reference tweets so people have an idea of what to expect from Yours. Altcoins are not all scams but the way that STEEM was created, definitely makes it look like one.

Don't do it.

would you like some more salt with that salt?

It would definitely fit in well with the their business model like AirBnB's
