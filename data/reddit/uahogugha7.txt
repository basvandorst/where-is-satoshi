You mean all time low. 
Also an all time low from a year and a half ago isn't much to go on.

The problem for you is that there are lot of people in your situation. There are bagholders at every level now, 400s, 500s, 600s, 700s, 800s, 900s, 1000s, 1100s, 1200s, etc. And they want to get out. Not only that, the early adopters have been dumping a lot of their bitcoins on companies like tigerdirect, overstock, dell, etc. These companies need to sell their bitcoins to get cash. So with all these bagholders and companies looking to sell, along with the early investors looking at every opportunity to dump their bitcoins, there are lots of sell pressure for the foreseeable future. 
Right now bitcoins are thinly traded so the-powers-that-be may manipulate the price higher to lure more noobs into the game. If that happens, you will have an opportunity to dump your coins. But who knows. My guess is that the price will continue to bleed lower.


What? You can trade bitcoins on margin? Amazing. If you are trading with margin, you may not have a choice. Your broker may liquidate you if the price drops to a certain level. 
First of all, only you can decide whether or when to cut your losses. 
Secondly, you shouldn't be asking because is a scam subreddit run by pump and dump scammers. 
Look at the prominent bitcoiners. They are mostly criminals and thieves. Roger Ver, Mark Karpales, charlie shrem, etc. Bunch of money grubbing jews trying to steal your money.

Yes. You can only deduct $3K off of income every year. But if you have other capital gains, you can deduct as much from that. 
My guess is that the IRS will be on alert for bitcoin losses, so make sure you have the documents to back it up.

It depends on what the sellers want to do. They may withdraw their order and let the price climb a bit to sell at a higher price. 
But given the price action, it seems like some big players don't care about bilking retail out of money and just want to get out of their bitcoin position.
Keep in mind that a lot of corporations ( DELL, Tigerdirect, Overstock, etc ) have to sell their bitcoins also. So in the near term, there is lot of overhead in the bitcoin market.
