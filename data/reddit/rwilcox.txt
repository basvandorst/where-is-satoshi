Nope, not him. Apparently the author is using some open source package from Ethan but forgot to change a config setting.

Since bitcoiners are some of the most "buyer beware" people I know, I'd love to hear your opinion here: what due diligence did you do around buying the house?
From inspections on your own to knowing your down payment won't get stolen to knowing your mortgage is *actually* getting paid when you write the check to your company every month, etc etc....  to making sure the various contracts were valid / still what you expected them to be at signing.
Edit: or that the mortgage/title even belongs to the entity that claims to owns the house?

I don't think they *did* place their life savings in BTC.
Sounds like took $30 a couple-four years ago, bought 60 BTC and forgot about it until now. Wakes up, realizes they made a good choice, and that their investment made 1000x return... Realized that this is more money than is in any other asset and decided to move it out. Maybe to diversify, even!
We could hope to be so lucky: invest "what you can afford to lose" and hey it turns into real money. Even if you turn down your nose at people who are just in for the investment hey wouldn't it be nice if you could take "afford to lose money" and buy a house )or lambo!) via the blockchain?
The OP views this as bring out $30K. One could also view this as being out $30 and a bunch of potential money. But it does illustrate the need for enhanced security from the Big Players (exchanges) as the stakes get bigger as the USD&amp;lt;-&gt; BTC rate gets larger. (and maybe watching your investments more carefully: probably would have been a good idea for the OP to have transferred to separate/paper wallets  6 months ago when the rate was $200ish
