Satoshi will be underrated like tesla for a while but then soon humanity will realize that how he single handedly saved them.

@_date: 2017-12-24 07:12:13
you are right, but we have to show them that who is the boss.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:44:51

well, the btc community is full of immature panickers. Many of us have fallen prey and I fear if the proper response is not initiated, bch will win :(
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:15:50
The coup will fail eventually

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:40:53
mine is stuck for 12 days. Help if someone can. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:12:40
hodl for atleast a month.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:50:17
This is just another trial friend, just hodl and be patient. It will bear its fruits very soon

Lets just wait and watch. If btc can survive with everything thrown at it, then just imagine where it can go untouched.

Because their knowledge of economy is obsolete when compared to sitoshi`s 9 page marvel.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:05:29
why did the transaction fee increase all of sudden? any chances of it going back to normal?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:51:21
hat did you fix sir? My transaction is still pending :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:55
yes, downtime of coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:59:01
Govt cracking down on exchanges/ICOs could be a serious threat...
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:39:30
Dip wont take place. Because to buy eth, bch and other crypto, people have to buy btcs first
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:23:59
Wait till christmas atleast before cashing out. I would say cash out a littlebit at that time and then wait for it to hit ~20k mark
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:31:46
Right now, I think mostly the investments and purchase of other crypto currencies such as eth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:43
how do you know if volumes are being sold at gdax? Sorry I am a bit noob in this.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:09:01
Just like mmr in dota :D
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:52:22
greedy investors my friend
@_date: 2018-02-08 06:07:50
just segwit so far baby, lightning is yet to strike the terror :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:26:03
Ok, I guess we wont be hearing "scaling fud" and bcash trash for a foreseeable time  unless btc reaches 100k$ ?
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:31:13
