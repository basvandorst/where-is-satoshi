den bröd sammen og jeg måtte installere den igen, det gjorde jeg så med en sikkerhedskopi. Den var meget skadet, fik ikke alle mine filer med og jeg tro ikke at jeg har fået dat. filen med. men jeg har en kopi af hele harddisken liggende på en ekstern harddisk. så ved ikke om der er noget at gøre. jeg har fundet de mail fra dengang med MTGox og kan se hvad adresse der er tilknyttet alle de transaktioner jeg har lavet til den wallet er, men jeg ved ikke om teknologien er kommet så langt at man kan hente den ud fra den.
