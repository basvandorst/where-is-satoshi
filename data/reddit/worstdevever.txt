This may have worked for PnD's in 2013 but if you look at the bitcointalk thread discussing new alts it seams PnD's are getting far more complex than just a value of a "scarce resource".. 
From the promises of stealth transactions to investment platforms smart wallets (not sure what that is) , and immortality on a blockchain. :P

I thought this was kinda obvious when Shape Shift started.  There was no other way to do this other than to have large amounts of all the coins, and seeing as it was Erik, it was fine because his rich..  I assumed though that the wallets where somehow more secure such as users deposits going into cold storage... 'exchanged' currency coming out of hot wallets and then an algorithm controlling the floats from cold to hot the whole time while trading on other markets to keep balance.  
My believe is because Erik is who he is (VC, business minded) created shapeshift as a MVP (which he admits recently).. So he probably did the numbers and knew the risk/reward and ROI before all the hot wallets would be covered.  Who knows. He could still be in the green depending on how well he did on the margins and when they where buying certain coins etc..   The only difference here is he had the cash to scale up extremely quickly because of his big pockets..  And if this was done by anyone else it probably would have just been hacked before they could have grown the floats. 
It was also convenient exchange for so many people.  So don't under estimate that.  For users it really was low risk as you would get your coins exchanged quickly with little risk of keeping coin on an exchange.  
So... If I was you I would finish your decentralized version of shapeshift.  (I would love to help you do the front end UI) and just run it..  Erik will most likely make you an offer of a few mill for the tech and or Shapeshift will carry on getting hacked and leveraging money while you slowly grow and make a profit.  IT is not that hard to advertise this type of thing.. I believe shapeshifts traffic mainly came from ads on coinmarketcap and the likes for some time.

The feature on Carte Blanch last night to half a million people probably did more than this statement by the reserve bank will do.

Interesting. .  The gov should still hold accountability for scams and fraud using Bitcoin though in my opinion even if they don't consider Bitcoin as anything..    For instance say I set up a company and sell people 'air' presale and then shut down it would be considered a scam and I would be prosecuted .. surely..  But the way the RB has made the above statement its almost like saying I could set up a company selling 'bitcoin' and just rob people and they wouldn't be responsible.  But I spose the reserve bank would just not be involved and the police/court system would deal with Bitcoin companies or individuals stealing funds.  Surely.

Lol.  Not many..  It would not be feasible to train staff and keep up the infrastructure (phones or tablets connected to their POS) running then they would make from the gain in business.  Most of us in SA that care about BTC have been in it since 2013 I would guess.  Also even us in the Bitcoin scene here don't really carry around BTC and use it more for taking payments for freelance work online or you know... whatever else.

Mainly just your average intro to Bitcoin such as what it is, what controls it and how the Bitcoins are distributed and about the blockchain. How to get a wallet and buy some. Some of the info was wrong IMO such as how they spoke about all nodes holding copies of the entire blockchain and how its decentralized. *cough*   Then they did an interview with the owner of Bitx exchange where he transferred R20 from his phone into the presenters through the Bitx wallet app. He ended saying "People should take note and consider buying a little bit of bitcoin just so you can say you are a part of this.." or something to that effect.   It was pretty decent. And positive over all.

Too True!  Though some get prosecuted at least.  The SARB makes it sound like if Karpeles had run gox from here he would have got away scot free with no problems.

A 15 minute feature on Bitcoin just aired on M-Net in South Africa and enjoys a local viewership of over 500 000 people every week!  :) 
@_date: 2016-04-25 08:33:19
"A mention regarding the VC landscape in South Africa is made as well, as the Reserve Bank says how they do not supervise or regulate these activities. Anyone is free to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but there is no legal protection if a company or individual would steal someone’s funds. "  
Remind me to never trust a South African Bitcoin company with my monies.

Leaving instructions and a trezor (BTC hardware wallet) or paper wallet in a safety deposit box that's in your will would suffice. 
I would probably guess though that around 80% of BTC holders do not have any plans to allow for this transfer of ownership and many coins will be lost as the generation dies, It is already happening. 
It is seen as a donation to all the other Bitcoin holders though as the coins permanently leave circulation, decreasing available supply, thus increasing the value of the coins in circulation.

Except Paypal holds funds and you have an account with paypal. With payfast they just process your card and pay the merchant via bank EFT. So completely different. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:48:53
Not really a paypal competitor but a payment processor. 
More similar to Circle than paypal. 
Also they sell the coins on bitx.co.za as you pay as far as I know.

Other than just plain old Bitcoin?   Nope, we use Paypal in South Africa mainly and even the major banks are connected with Paypal for deposits/withdrawals.

Bitcoin is a Giant (online) ledger where everyone can see all the transactions. Once you send a amount of bitcoin you are essentially writing to the ledger. Once you or anyone writes to the ledger everyone else('s computer) checks to make sure you not cheating the ledger.  For checking the ledger, computers get a small reward every 10minutes depending on how much 'work' they do.

Interesting theory but I do not think costs of producing a new currency in a PoS system is zero. 
You are correct to assume that in a PoW system (without much more demand than supply) the price should gravitate towards the cost of production. (Electricity + equipment + labour) 
But your assumption a PoS currency is without such costs is unfounded.  A PoS system requires you to buy in with real value. You also have to normally keep your coins online in a node type operation which has some running cos (Though not as much as paying electricity on a PoW system obviously) . 
So to keep things simple lets say you bought $100 worth of PoS currency that was priced at 1$ per token and the inflation rate was 5% per year.  
Your theory is you would dump as the mining is free but as soon as the price of the currency drops to a point where the amount of coins you have in total is less than ($100 - whatever amount you have gotten from selling thus far) , you will be selling at a loss from your initial investment and should have an incentive to hold the new coins rather than selling just like a PoW miner that has sunken costs. 
A interesting aspect tho is the price at which people get the coins to stake at. As some could pay very different prices and have very different 'mining' costs. 
I always thought a proof of burn into PoS is the only way to really get a fair PoS start as people would be burning value in order to stake such that everyone 'pays' an equal amount of value in order to keep staking fair for everyone.

I also only vaguely remember reading about this a year or two ago and I think a currency did attempt this but there was no money for development or interest. (As you can imagine demand is an extremely important part of the equation that few coins have managed to get right and boast a large market cap) 
EDIT:  Also it does not have to be throughout the coin, only on launch. as thereafter it will be the PoS model that will distribute new currency

I used to send money to Tanzania via Bitcoin to a friend every month. 
This year I switched over to western union because 
1: it is now faster to use western union.  (I used to have to wait for blockchain and exchange etc which is a few btc transactions to get the money out into shillings into his phone pesa account - Impossible to do now in under a few days) 
2: It was cheaper.  (But now the fees and exchange rates make it more expensive than WU)

You would have to deposit Bitcoin into your luno wallet first (Which is like an exchange) and that takes a few confirms. 
The thought is, everyone in SA uses Luno anyway.

Coinbase is like a bank..  IF you leave bitcoin in coinbase or any other exchange you do not own the coin just like you do not own any money in your bank accounts.  They are only IOU's,  IF they close down ever you will lose your btc.   Just use a paper wallet and keep it in your safe and a copy in your parents safe.  You can encrypt your private key with a password so nobody can take the funds without the private key + password. 
Part of the reason why most of us love Bitcoin is that if anything happens nobody can take your bitcoin away from you.  Putting your trust back into companies like coinbase is completely against why bitcoin was even invented.  If we could trust centralized banks with our savings we would not need bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 08:15:27
I would second this advice.   Put a percentage of your savings and a percentage of your weekly paycheck into BTC..

It is because of the Carte Blanche showcase. 
They air their informative journalism program to half a million South Africans every Sunday.  The show was mainly about what Bitcoin is etc.. 
And hence a lot of those people are now Googling what it is.  This has nothing to do with MMM, inflation etc..  Last year was the worst inflation, corruption and largest push of MMM we've had and only since the Carte Blanche thing has the searches been climbing like that.
