I'm just saying no risk no reward
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:23:22
Right, if it hits 100,000 you'll have 1300$, such a small amount of money is practically meaningless, the risk correlates with the reward, and you're risking nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:24:24
You hope
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:01:25
Lol, my banks(one of Australia’s big ones) system went down for 2 days so I couldn’t buy any then, then when it finally came back up I managed to get the transaction through, then they sent me an email saying it was suspicious(even though I did it in the bank) and made me call them and confirm it. Suspended my account the next day until I called them again. 
Tldr the banks suck not the exchanges 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:27
Aren't the miners just people who have bought gear 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:00
Just checked you  other 3 posts hahaha, what do you gain from this? Do you want people to sell so you can buy or
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:59:17
Okay but if only the true BELIEVERS buy bitcoin then it'll never be worth it, the majority are just trying to make a $,  
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:51
Yeah I don't think it'll go near 10k, but if you sold now at 15k and bought at 12-13 you'd be pretty chuffed, although typing it makes me not so convinced... maybe I'll just hold 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:27
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:47
I feel like it's going to drop even further before futures 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:46
No it's not, but if it was in BCH form not USD then they can do WHATEVER
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:21:16
Hahaha I was joking who would buy that shit 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:31:15
It's worth the risk... maybe
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:53:47
What, if you bought 1 bitcoin at 17.6k on coinbase even if it takes 10 days to get through you'll still have 17.6k.
If you paid with credit card it would be instant,(should) 
What site is offering heavy discounts when you buy with bitcoin? Sounds very interesting
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:46:50
Well and good to say "bitcoin is a bubble" because I don't care, I just want to make money. Which I and several other people are doing. Will the bubble pop at 25k? 100k? 1 mil? Maybe it won't ever pop
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:14
I have work right now hahah 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:42:54
Hm, but people have been saying it's going to crash forever, why are you so confident it won't keep on going up? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:45:49
No correction is good, the price of bitcoin went down, we all just lost money
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:43:16
When was the last time it went up 100% in a month again?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:35
But that's only because bitcoin cash is like 1/10th the size of bitcoin, if it gets used as much as bitcoin is it will be just as slow 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:23:44
I have a query with  when you say core will divert? What do you mean by that, and how will EVERYONE but me walk away with $?

Why do you think that? Like where did you just whip that number from lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:07:19
NOOOO YOURE ONKY MAKING IT WORSE
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:59
But I think(¿) that if they tried to short it and bet billions they would be betting against someone else betting billions. At least that's what I read, on reddit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:21
Why is one better than the other 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:30
Yeah I'm so split between buying or selling 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:55
Hmmm, but also the bubble might deflate, but then there's all these other people that will inflate it at the same time.
For it to truely become a currency it would need to have instant transactions and very low fees, and I'm told that people are trying to fix that, although since no one owns bitcoin I don't know how that works. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:56:23
Yes I feel like this,
They say lightning network but where is that? How do you implement it? How does this thing work 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:26
I use it for constant updates on what people are thinking, also it's a great way to keep up to date on the bitcoin news, 
And yeah it's filled with people asking the same questions that have been answered a million times 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:45:12
Cex.io works pretty well, 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:37
What exchange? Cex.io is basically back at 20k
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:32:39
Hmm, fair point 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:31
Buy gold, with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:32
Your coinbase/gdax account? Why would you want to do that? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:40:45
Well they might be a little more sketchy 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:24:04
The big question is do you sell now and buy when it's dips tomorrow? Seems to be what's going on
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:02:34
Yes, that is a huge problem, it can't work as a day to day currency when a transaction might not go through for a week. But I was under the impression that someone somewhere  was fixing that 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:53
Accuracy? What do you mean? The fees do suck yeah 
I imagine about 6 months ago the community would of been pretty tight and much different, but you can't deny that this was always the end goal. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:06:27
So she just gave away 18k
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:00
Buy now, buy some more if it dips, it'll go back up, probably. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:07:54
Sometimes you have to take a step back and realise it's just money, only numbers. Family is everything and you couldn't of predicted this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:01
Yeah not sure they're anal af, but they work exactly like a bank? Are they not a bank? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:00:21
I didn't buy in the dip I want more diiip!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:54:46
No one knows, but I’m holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:54
That's rather slow based on the past 12 months 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:39:42
Imagine you're just starting out at life, you realise that you're going to probably end up working at a 9-5 job that isn't that good getting 800-1000$ per week until you can save up for a house deposit in maybe a few years, then spend most of your life paying that off while starting a family and forcing your kids to go through the same thing. Then you see that bitcoin jumped from 1000$ to 17000$ in less than a year, what do you do? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:46:11
How did you do so badly lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:20:08
So if bitcoin goes up to 100,000$ you'll have what 250$? 250$ won't change anything, you have to risk big to win big, you're just risking small to win small,
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:35:36
So it is a scam, but if I withdraw before they scam me I keep the profits? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:16
Weird, coinbase was the only exchange that got so low, cex.io got to 18.2 
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:56:37
IM NOT LOSING MONEY OK 
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:19:15
They aren’t hack they’re people giving their information away 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:28:03
So you haven't taken any out? What if it crashes ����
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:56
On my way 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:01:39
I just want to be rich, 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:31
But I think that just means you were given money? From nothing? Is that what a fork is? Wth
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:58:38
Uhh yes, we all do, we would be selling our coins if we thought otherwise. I'm hoping a month? Dunno, whenever Ln or Segwit comes in 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:45
Not as many people that got into it at 10k, that's when it bounced to 18k in like 10 days, some exchanges hit 19k, then it dropped back down to 16/17k...
How have you already forgotten what happened last week 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:59:24
Did you manage to make some money from it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:04:13
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:19:56
So you're telling me it's either going to pop, or its not? Thnx for your sound financial advice x
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:16:57
Righto tell me what you KNOW? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:17:40
It’s really not the same as gold 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:59
So if you are a long time bitcoiner then you know this happens all the time, hold and buy 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:44:52
And that will stop it from congesting? I've heard people say otherwise. There must be a negative 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:32
You don't have to use the exchanges to sell, but if you have 1000 bitcoins you've probably already set up an exchange so you don't have any sell limit.
Put 200 coins in 5 exchanges then put your sell orders up, it wouldn't be hard
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:25:36
No I wouldn’t 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:05:33
I do hope so, I'm worried the early boys that have thousands of coins will dump them and crash the market, other than that I don't see how it'll go down
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:01:09
The real problem is after a week when your 50$ turns 100$ you’ll wish you put in 5000$, or get a small loan of 25k?
But no one knows if it’s going to keep raising at the rate it is or if it’s going to crash tomorrow, 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:09:47
Brutally honest but true, if he sold at 30$ no way he'd make it past 100$,1000$,10000$. I think the only way to get around this is to be a true believer and always hold, or to never sell all your BTC(even if you only sell half you'll eventually regret selling the half if it moons). 
Then again if you could if sold your 10btc for 170,000$ buy it drops to 100$ per bitcoin tomorrow and never rises there would be even more regret, if only I could see the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:29:41
So accurate, at least I'm helping out bitcoin by buying high selling low
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:36:52
Yes I think you've pointed out an undeniable flaw which will eventually lead in the death of bitcoin. Don't tell anyone 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:29:33
I think you meant 2 days 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:03:45
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:50:54
Bitcoin is money ffs when you get bitcoin you aren't buying some stock you're just trading one type of currency for another 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:28
Is a fork needed for the implementation of the lightning network? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:21:21
I'm pretty sure you can use us exchanges in Aus 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:34:48
Nah only if you have google or some sort of access to the internet,
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:00:54
I envy that, I’m waiting for money to transfer internationally, 5 business days doesn’t seem like much but when I fall asleep and wake up and there’s 1k difference it seems like eternity.
I’m going to try buy in the dip but if not I’m still buying 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:57
Sure, and last weeks lotto numbers were worth? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:25:34
Ahhhh no, it doesn't x
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:51:12
Dunno, no one does, but think about how many people asked that question when it it $100, then $1000, then $10000. I think it will keep going up, do you? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:12
Yeah sketchy dogs spread the world that coinbase is a scam,
Although I really want to sell my btc on cex.io for 18k then buy on coinbase for 15k?? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:44:38
Sounds like you just panic sold, now want other people to sell so you can buy back in 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:54:06
But I just sold mine and now I have an extra thousand $ in the bank? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:59:31
Transfer to cex.io, transaction fee tho :( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:43
It's not a bad idea, but it wouldn't gain you anything, nor would you lose anything really. I don't think you can shut down you account.
I keep coinbase because i bought bitcoin just before when it was at 15k on coinbase, but sold the same amount on CEX.IO for 19k, so if I sold 1 bitcoin on cex.io at 19k then bought one for 15k on coinbase I'd make 4000$, then I just transfer it over to cex.io again! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:36
It's expected because people will want to sell and make profit maybe, doesn't mean it's good.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:40:08
I dunno, my new car says otherwise xxx 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:02
What is the core? And you're saying there's no hope of Ln being  implemented? I thought they started testing a week or so ago? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:57:37
True, I'd rather risk it then not though 
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:55:56
Yeah see this is SUPER weird too because it’s day/month/year or maybe year/month/day what kinda system would scramble them? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:11:21
How much are you going to sell?? Christ that is a success story, going straight to the big leagues in one day. 
Hit me up x
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:58:58
Sunday 6PM EST, hoping for a nice dip to buy into 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:41:21
If it doesn’t go down you’ll only make money! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:02:07
Fuck the bloodlines, nothing matters but you, maybe bitcoin can buy you immortality 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:37:53
I think it's a good time to buy in, 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:10:38
If she invested 3 months ago surely she's not mad about the 20% drop? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:05:09
People see that you can potentially make quick easy money so they buy?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:46:51
Why would you talk about something you have no idea about 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:45
Yep, coinbase is so user friendly and I'd say the one most newbies use, hence the panic sell.
Sell on cex and buy on coinbase, there was a 4K difference just before ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:42:32
From what I can tell the system is majorly congested right now, everyone’s complaining about long transactions, I think it’s a cross between luck of the draw/transaction fee paid 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:19:00
It did just dip, from 18k to 14, buy now and never regret anything 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:27:11
Butt, I suppose until every holder of bitcoin is dead then the price will just adjust since there is less supply
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:16
Sold at 16.2 bought at 16.6 :( 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:54
Pretty sure it's about to dip hard, Hold 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:47:47
Because they could get hacked? They could just take my money? These are the only two things I can think of 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:12:44
But it doesn't burst from 18k to 0$ straight away, people will see it falling down and they will buy in, then it will eventually go back up, THIS is what happened in the financial crisis in 2018 no? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:36:08
Same, at 300$ I thought that it’s about to crash, same at 1k, and 10k, now it’s 15k, 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:23:18
Only if you donate to me first :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:52:08
Hahah okkkkk you obviously have no money in bitcoin. And the bitcoin community is cancer, it's just a mix of people. Don't suck my dick 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:45:02
Wait a week, then you'll start to see profit.(maybe?)
Imagine if you didn't buy and it soared up to 30k, no one can predict the future
Also imagine if the price dropped to 0$ tomorrow and you could of sold now and barely lost anything 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:12:11
Yeah I learnt my lesson, hold
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:47:42
How long ago would a setup like this have been useful? Worthwhile? I thought it was only like a year ago 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:37:14
No one can tell you what’s going to happen tomorrow, but wait until just after futures launches, I’m thinking there will be a dip there that’ll be nice
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:18
Judging by the past it would be worth like 11,000$ 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:46
Hell yeah any win is a win, Gdax sounds like it's always going down 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:46:08
Another of his posts kinda makes me doubt his infinite knowledge 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:16
Yesss, but what if while you're buying coins upon coins some other big dog sells theirs, I guess nothing's guaranteed but this does sound like a pretty good plan if everything goes right. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:59:34
This Reddit is a huge source of opinions and facts, I saw on the news that BTC hit 10k usd, you vets have made a huge amount of money and have spent time learning how the system works, I planned on watching and learning for a few weeks before deciding took put money in, but with it going up 80% a week I decided to put money in with only a basic understanding. I imagine a lot have done the same as me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:30:21
Hmmmm so you don't care if it goes up because it has no use, say you have 10 coins and sell them for 170,000$ right now, but if you waited until they were at 100k per coin(speculation) and sold 10 coins then you would have 1,000,000$! But that's no use is it.
We all know you have 0 coins so to away x 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:12
If everyone sees that bcash has gone from 2k to 10k in one day then FOMO will kick in and everyone will buy bcash!!! Or at least that's what coinbase/gdax wants you to think because they are the only ones that are saying bcash is worth 9.5k. They are simply lying
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:05
What the fuck is a "healthy" correction, there literally isn't any such thing 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:06:00
When are you buying in? How low will it dip! I know no one knows but I'm exited to buy into the dip and make dosh, 
But also don't want to buy it and then watch bitcoin crash to 0 ����
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:06
Can you please elaborate and use some nouns 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:49:21
Wouldn't any dip/crash already of happened? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:01:31
The nerds who were around when you could buy thousands for like 50$, but also the people who just happen to have billions of $, idk they certainly don't lurk on reddit like us
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:44
What writing on the wall? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:30
Well I THINK that'll it back to 20k in 5 hours, you're looking for confirmation that it will go back up because you're worried but no one can confirm anything, no one knows what's happening and we are all worried, but hey it normally goes back up so we should ok 
@_date: 2018-09-01 03:16:07
Where are you living? Is it your home? Why can’t you get a job?
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:39:20
Feign ignorance if you get caught. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 06:38:52
I believe he’s saying that these people are coming and disrupting his country like the “muslims” did in France. We define them by their religion because that’s the reason for the conflict, or so they claim(it’s money and power as per use) so no, it’s not wrong to say you don’t  want those people in your country, but when you yourself want to leave your country for a better one? Makes you seem hypocritical.
Anyone who judges someone due to their race is an idiot, they have no evidence for their claim. If you judge someone because of the region they’re from or the religion they believe in? Perfectly acceptable as region and religion would be maybe two if the biggest players in someone’s personality.
Also HARDETH, I wouldn’t go around shouting “I’m a catholic” because anyone not an idiot knows that the Catholic Church supports pedophiles( and that the Catholic Church(specifically catholic) is RENOWN for spending huge amounts of money settling child sexual assault cases(hey sorry I fucked your asshole when you were a kid here’s some money).  So “I’m catholic” translated to “I support pedophiles and kiddy fuckers”, make your own mind up about the mysteries of the universe, don’t just follow an evil religion just because your family is. Disgusting 
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:42:47
It’s pretty private though isn’t it? Anonymous is private 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:10:20
Cex.io only dipped like a 1000$ I don't think it'll go below 18k 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:21:26
Idk they did some real dodgy shit yesterday, said bitcash was worth 9,500$ and then cancelled all their orders.
Not to mention that it's filled with all the new people to crypto, yesterday it dropped to 14.5k(from 20) USD and is still only at 16.6, most other exchanges dropped around 2k but nothing compared to coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:30:51
Funny,  bitcoin maxed out my credit card 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:48:36
74$ seems like a lot more than normal, 
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:37:57
One person puts toward a baseless claim and the next does it back?
I know that people used to mine like this like a year ago 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:22

Wouldn’t that mean that while there is a problem and in the future people could exploit it but currently because there would still be people running these older nodes that anyone trying to exploit it would get rejected?

Coinbase is awful, new people that are starting to invest are using coinbase, it's easy, you download an app verify and then it's go time.
But secretly it's sucks, higher fees than almost all exchanges, not to mention they're always like 1-2k under other exchanges.
They are showing BitCash at 9.5k but every other exchange it's worth nothing over 3.5k, looks like coinbase/gdax did a deal with bcash? Idk maybe.
I use CEX.IO and haven't had a problem with it. It dropped from 20.7 to 18.2 today while coinbase dropped down to 14.5

Put 40$ in and forget about it, come back when you've got some more money you're willing to use. Then put that in, there's always a risk of it crashing but you gotta risk it to get the biscuit

Some sites will charge less % but because it’s a credit card it’s normally pretty high, you’ll make the 3% back in the next few hours by the looks of it anyway.. Bank transfers are way cheaper but take longer.

Sunday 6PM EST is when futures launches, that's when it might dip, but it'll only dip if people think it will dip, just hold. If you try to sell before the dip then buy in the dip you'll either make a lot of money or you'll miss the dip, this is just my newbie opinion it could crash tonight
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:02:17
Coinbase added bitcash but didn't open the trading for it, they said it was worth 9.5k and when they opened trading they cancelled a heap of people orders and corrected it to 3.5k. Which is super dodgy. This was also the day after some Roger Ver(bit cash guy) told everyone he was the co founder of bitcoin and that it was going to crash and he had sold all his. It was all over the media

Maybe he sent 1500$ across and the bank approved it even though he only had 1200$ then the next day or something the bank changed their mind and pulled the money back, happens

Yeah and with coinbase that X variable is locked in from the time of purchase, if it's credit card it should be instant, just costs an extra 3%? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:46:31
So you're saying all you're doing is hoping and holding, even though you could sell and get some of those sweet life luxuries right now, you're hoping and risking those luxuries incase bitcoin becomes so huge that you get even more luxuries?

HAHAHHA what the fuck are you on about, "bro I used to like that song but now everyone plays it so it's shit bro like I'm only into indie stuff none of that mainstream shit I ain't no sheep"
You obviously don't have any bitcoin or you would love all the newcomers, you might of noticed when the media started talking about bitcoin(when it hit 10k) that it went up to 17k in about a week? That's why bitcoin goes up in value, because more people want it.
You get those YouTube ads because you google bitcoin so much and watch so many bitcoin videos.
And acting like a Wall Street investor is a good idea. Most people only heard about bitcoin a month ago, some less. The smart ones learn everything they can about it and then invest, and you're shutting on them for learning? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:04:15

It's only numbers mate 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:45:47
Because maybe they have more Btc than fiat because they’re trying to make money using it like a stock system, or maybe they believe that fiat one nation currencies really don’t make sense assuming we don’t whipe ourselves out it’s easy to imagine that nations will combine and we will probably use some sort of global online money system.

That’s not how worth works? You understand that currency’s are just used instead of a trading system? And you know that it is just a trading system? 
You could sell your bitcoin for usd and pay usd taxes, just like how you can sell your usd for aud to pay aud taxes.
Id also argue that taxes are worthless because it costs 10x the regular price if the government pays for it

@_date: 2018-08-01 01:30:38
You do know he’s not necessarily dissing bitcoin, bitcoin is worthless... but so is the US dollar, the difference is the government(our rulers) tell us that the dollar is safe and they can just print more anyway so it’s ok!! 
@_date: 2018-08-02 02:04:14
Yeah, people make tons of money (and lose tons) through crypto, that’s the reason it’s gotten so popular, and yeah Cryptocurrency is going to be the future, whether it will be bitcoin or some other coin or maybe the government will adapt the dollar to a crypto currency...
Also when you have bitcoin you are your own bank so no one actually has your money, and you can also buy stuff very secretly with it.  That’s why I like it at least

You’re an evil genius, whereabouts is this located? And where can I get a laser stencil maker, are they hard to use? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 02:06:01
No the workers pay for the taxes, currency is just a representation of value, our labour has value, how much depending on the person, so you give your labour and your employer gives you the value of that labour in currency which you then give to the government so they can pay for other people’s labour.
So when you say the usd pays us taxes that’s not right, the people pay the taxes? 
Maybe I missed the point you’re trying to make.. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:11:00
So the 210billion to 215 billion, that’s coins in exchanges right? 
And a 300$ increase in 24 hours? I know it’s been pretty slow the past few months but 300$ difference is normal? 
@_date: 2018-08-01 23:39:41
Very true,

You mean the headline? Well since bitcoins value is basically what people perceive it... no, I think headlines and articles like this used to help crypto by giving it hype and therefore the bull run, but now when I look at it “150,000 times greater then when first released in 2010” that line literally means nothing and is obviously worded to make people think “wow 150 THOUSAND times profit?? I want some!” 
But maybe im just cynical now because I lost money. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:15:11
But I did lose money, we can’t be certain that bitcoin will succeed to the moon, if it does I’ll make my money back, if it doesn’t I’ve thrown myself into the world of crypto and the shit I’ve learned on investing and markets is probably worth it.

You could call up a few hospitals and ask. A lot of the paintings in my hospital are just hung on the wall, they all have prices next to it and the money goes to the painter.

Took me a long time to figure out no one knows what’s going to happen. 
But it’s based of what people BELIEVE,  that’s basically it right now. If people believe it’s gonna go up they’ll buy more and that will force the price to go up.
Then there’s the long term value, and Venezuela is the best example of why Bitcoin or something just like it is 100% a must in the future. The rate of inflation is just unsustainable, there’s no way our current economic system will last 100 more years. It’s just a question of if it will be bitcoin or the same thing under a different name. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 10:48:00
How long did it take? Faster than other ques? Probably not yet. 
Also it’s important to always sell bitcoin like a salesman, if you can sell the idea of bitcoin then bitcoins price goes up, and we get richer. And adoption increases

How traceable is bitcoin? If someone was robbed of their coins could they then go to some (free?) service that will track where the coins went? But realistically you don’t need to put your name to your wallet... 
And you can’t undo transactions; like when your kiddy takes your iPad and buys 3 bitcoin worth of Coles toys you can’t undo that. 
Hmm this is a huge problem, pretty sure this is the problem that made people use banks... o oh

Your problem is you seem to think that despite it never ever happening before humans will somehow get to the point where everyone decides “I’m not going to litter” 
Problem is buddy the worlds not like that, people aren’t like that. It’s easier and fits society better to pay others to pick up the rubbish.

Ehhhh, dunno man my transactions go through basically instantly now and I’ve bought some shit online as easy as I would with my credit card? 
5 years ago your payment provider looked into it? Wouldn’t he be like insanely rich if he went with it? But he decided against it? And he was you know, wrong? 
It’s closer to a currency because of how well known it is and how fast transactions are, it’s instant, once you know it’s easy, I use it for its proper use a lot. I wonder if you could like a card to a wallet, I wonder if you could use PayPass!

Your relative is a sook, the number of fake votes is small in comparison, how many does he reckon he gets a day? 
And the second part is more to the point, the government wastes literally trillions, I don’t know if the OP pays his taxes, but I know I do and I know that so much of it is wasted, and no it’s not wasted by people like the OP doing joke votes or people stealing street signs. The bulk of the waste is on shit that the nation doesn’t need and just general shit.
I also get paid by the government so I’m basically paying double tax

I’m saying he shouldn’t feel guilty for wasting government money, and I would also then agree, remember earth hour where everyone turned off their lights for an hour? Then it came out that it did next to nothing in comparison to the factories ect.
The damage he did was PROBABKY less than what he gives to society, as long as that balances out he’s allowed into heaven in my books. 
You act like he should be thankful for paying his taxes and that we should be pissed at him for wasting them? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:46:00
Small actions build up to but consequences over time sure, still a drop in the ocean compared to the real people littering the ocean. 
Go tell people not to litter, fine them, see what happens. Oh what epoele are still littering?! Wow wonder why your plan didn’t work.
people have shown time again that they will do  easiest for them, it’s obviously not working trying to make people “better” or more hard working, spend tax money on jobs to clean up the streets why not? Use it as a punishment, community service.

He didn’t do it for just 7 reddit Karma, I bet he even snap chatted it to his friends. And as I said, if he’s paying his taxes then he’s paying for their services. Even if they had to manually read every vote and then manually hand write it out you’re really exaggerating. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:54:53
Please answer my question that I highlighted in the above comments?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:32:11
ANALYSTS PREDICT MORE CHAOS IN CRYPTO CURRENCY COULD BE ANYWHERE BY 2019
@_date: 2018-11-13 07:50:19
True, but since global markets are so intwined isn’t it if one crashes they’re all fucked? Like which proper first world countries could collapse without the rest going down? Isn’t that why everyone is paying Greece’s bills? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:14:46
Ahh true, so unless they give out all the money that is asked then they lose.
How much are people withdrawing though? Guess we don’t know, when will we find out? 
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:35:25
People like you would work perfectly in a perfect world. But since it’s not perfect you just seem naive and foolish. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:58:39
Incorrect, you misunderstand what value is. 
For example, when the bank is coming to claim your home they won’t accept $50,000 worth of bitcoin when they want $100,000. Even if you say “your crazy man bitcoin is the FUTURE”
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:38:03
Yeah but won’t it also need like infinite energy 
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:14:01
Yeah I know its not his actual account, I didn’t see he was verified, I thought you had to be you know, verified to be verified 
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:31:01
OR much higher! 
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:02:53
Not really? It’s never been closer to working like a real currency 
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:36:10
Gah, cmon mr brick wall. Let me ask, do people litter? And also do you expect something to make every single person in the world stop littering? 
If I stop littering it doesn’t fix any problem, heaps of other people still litter, there’s no way you can convince every single human to not litter, therefore you find another way. OR like you do, we go around telling people to stop littering, like we tell people to stop raping. Your solution is a bandaid. 
I don’t personally litter, but I know other people who do, I see it all the time. I also know that the rubbish worldwide is building up, we aren’t reducing litter at all. So it’s 100% clear that what we are doing isn’t working, so if I see someone littering I’m not going to tell them to stop, because they don’t care and it doesn’t actually help the problem. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:54:54
BRo what hard fork?? Looks like it’s causing problems for btc too 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:27:59
Yeah I completed that, said I was fully verified but still they say they sent a letter, 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:13:51
It is kinda hard since we are talking about human opinions and emotions, trump was backed by verified journalists, journalists have ZERO respect nowadays. We got candidates like trump because people can be easily fooled, and because the news can blantantly lie, as can anyone and not be held accountable. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 07:45:56
It’s about promoting bitcoin, doesn’t matter what else 
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:53:31
$2.70 per litre? Holy fuck it’s $1.70 AUD over here and I thought that was fucked 
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:58:27
Trade my bitcoin for AUD cash? No thanks lol 
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:44:50
Yeah that’s probably the most efficient way, I’m just gonna sit still with mine 
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:00:00
Won’t the banks just stop all withdrawals? 
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:04:55
Hah! It’s not about being chicken or ballsy, bitcoins value in exchanges is literally just based on people’s opinions, and I know for a fact that no one can work out how the worlds opinions work out.
Seriously, the true whales, the true big boys, the bitcoin billionaires, they don’t do that day trading nonsense, or if they do it’s just good old market manipulation on a single exchange. Most exchanges have a teeny tiny market cap. 
You’re so far from the truth 
@_date: 2018-11-10 01:37:22
Christ, why are you always trying to undermine me instead of proper debate, it’s like talking to a wall.
If the president of the United States of America and one of the largest news stations in America is saying something and you’re here on reddit saying “LIES” well IF it is lies then that’s a huge fucking problem with media is it not? It proves that they can say whatever they like and not be held accountable, it’s not only Fox News either. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:38:38
Really sad that they’re shutting down all crypto, too bad it never took off. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:27:12
Thanks I’ll give it a whirl 
@_date: 2018-11-10 04:14:14
Because the president can freely lie it makes all news kinda suspect, we are supposed to be able to believe the government, not try and figure out which news is true or not. Almost all mainstream news has bias, depends on who funds them. And in this age of entertainment news has became just that. News outlets get rewarded on clicks, not their reputation . 
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:56:37
How can voting at all be serious when you have candidates like Donald trump, and not only that but when he lies he can just say “no I didn’t” with no reppurcussion, if don gets voted out in 2020 then nothing will change, one day another don will get in. The system needs serious change and for that to actually happen there needs to be serious problems.
How long until climate change is taken truely serious? When it starts truely fucking with us.
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:41:16
Right but do you sell at 10k? Or 20k? Then do you buy back in at 8k? Or 3k? 
Exchanges would be so easy to manipulate if you had a bit of cash. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 23:11:21
And I’m arguing with someone who refuses to acknowledge other variables, it must be nice living so simply 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:17:32
Did you analyse any patterns???

It’s interesting how the brain copes with loss 
@_date: 2018-11-15 22:05:58
True it seems like twitters promoting algorithm is somehow messing up,  but I’m probably 50/50 on whether it’s twitter being broken or Elon musk is genuinely promoting it 
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:31:08
Yes they probably should, we also should excercise daily, we also shouldn’t commit abhorrent crimes, but we do!! 
People WILL NOT stop writing juvenile jokes, will they? ANSWER THIS QUESTION DIRECTLY DO YOU BELEIVE AT SOME POINT SOMETHING WILL MAKE ALL HUMANS FOLLOW ALL LAWS WITHOUT A SINGLE EXCEPTION??? You keep ignoring that.
It’s your responsibility as an adult to make sure the government doesn’t waste money?? That’s not how you build up your business or assets, the easiest and best way to get to the top is by cheating the already flawed system and being smart about it. For example, trying your hardest in school is not how to get the best grade, you need to cheat the system and use its flaws to get to the top. Only by pointing out the flaws will something change.
It’s simple, if the fake votes are really THAT big of a problem then you can do two things, increase security and surveillance and also the punishment(death works best). This might still not work and is going towards a Orwellian lifestyle; OR you can fix how the votes are counted and make it so it’s not a problem. By the sounds of it they count it by eye and hand write out every single vote?? That already sounds horrifically flawed, there’s footage of a voting official saying heaps of non citizens have been voting so it’s clear there’s a huge problem. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 01:47:51
Elon is a renown bitcoin scammer don’t trust this guy. 
Me, on the other hand I’m running a similar give away. Just send me 5BTC or $10,000 cash to my address(just to verify) and I’ll send back 500% guaranteed. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:18:59
Hmm, i was playing a bit dumb but you’re straight up stupid, it’s not like that at all. It’s like walking into a restaurant that caters to only bitcoin users and then screaming your opinions, problem is everything you’ve ever posted is written right on your face so now we’ve got this weird dude screaming about how bitcoin sucks and how long it takes for a transaction and when you see that he’s really into psychedelics and Vals and When we mention that he starts screaming about privacy even though the stuff he’s saying is his “private personal business” was the same stuff that he went and screamed at a bunch of other people in a different restaurant. 
Why is this hard for you to understand, reddit is very much a public platform. No wonder you can’t use bitcoin if you can’t understand this lol  
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:00:57
No, he has the right to go through it, since you came into his life by posting on a reddit he follows he would naturally want to know more about you and that helps to judge and understand your post. Your neighbours garbage is private, by law. Your reddit posts are public and infact reddit is designed in a way so that people can view your post history.
In regards to your original post that sounds like a pain in the ass, when I buy bitcoin with my card it goes through instantly, then I can transfer and that normally takes 5 minutes because my site allows me to use it after 2 “confirmations” so there are ways for instant transactions. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 12:51:47

Okay; bitcoin is a representation of value right?
Instead of 10 firewood for 2 bread it’s 1 bitcoin for 10 firewood, or 2 bread for 1 bitcoin. 
Right? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:31:20
No, you just need something of value. You don’t need to go through an exchange to send bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:19:53
Bitcoins value is based on people’s opinions, WAY more than AUd/USD. I imagine the majority of people owning bitcoin consider it a money making scheme. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:48:22
I’d like to add my disagreement, and also point out that exchange prices can’t be trusted. It’s probably the easiest thing for whales to pump $$ into exchanges. Especially the smaller ones.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:42:27
YOU SEEM TO MISUNDERSTAND WHAT VALUE MEANS WHICH IS FUNNY AS CONSIDERING YOUR ON A REDDIT BASED AROUND VALUE AND CURRENCY HAHAHAHHAHAHAH
@_date: 2018-12-15 07:56:44
Smart man, shows how fast and easy you can use bitcoin. I’m actually VERY impressed. 
he’s giving away money and making that money worth more at the same time. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:49:30
Nothing was worse than my mates ripping me for bragging about how much I was making dec 2017 and how I should of sold in January and just my general angst that I was never going to see that money again.
I hope I’ll be kicking myself for not buying more while the prices are down, I really hope. 
I’ve risked enough for now
