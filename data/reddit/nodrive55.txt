I do it every month.  Works fine.  Just cash out and pay cc before reporting date.  As long as crypto is in this "almost can't lose' Bull Run, you will be fine

I read that bitmain is partnering with Sia for this mining expansion project with 28nm, full custom ASIC machines.   lots of them! This will push price of SC way way up. (And its dirt cheap right now)

True story! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:58:41
Great reply and good advice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:32
It doesn't sound like there is ever any kind of guaranteed solution. Thank you for the response
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:22:04
Oops, You are correct. My bad 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:50:45
For some reason the account is flagged to only allow deposits.  No withdrawals or transfers.  Phone support cannot explain why, however they state that "something is wrong". Lol, no sh*t
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:33:40
Yes, but I spotted it in Texas. Just outside Austin
@_date: 2018-05-03 10:11:59
Thanks for your response and advice.  The issue is the time to wait for support to get to the ticket.  After two weeks my patience has run out because the money is needed to fund my life.  I was hoping someone might know a contact at CB who could escalate. I'm probably relegated to wait and apologize to those i owe $ to until they greet around to me.

Thanks a million for your response. I really appreciate you taking the time and it definitely is an excellent demonstration of how members of the Bitcoin Community help each other. The good news is my ticket was answered 5 days later so although there was a two-week wait, my issue was addressed in a satisfactory fashion. Thank you very much and see you on the moon

Just buy 1000 btc and hodl it.  You'll be way ahead
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:01:56
 stash it away and if you're even thinking of Leverage trading, do it with everything you save after today but never touch your one Bitcoin again.   if you want my free advice
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:36:53
Thanks,  these require an individual setup process for each coin or token.  I was hoping to reduce my blockfolio refreshes by just getting notified anything goes up or down 10%.

If the are any programmers out there,  this could be a revenue generating app people would pay for. With the coming increase in popularity of crypto,  this could be the cat's pajamas
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:13:40
Thx, I'll check it out now
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:42:13
Good advice,  i like that one too for that nice custom alert set up,  but it doesn't handle multiple coins or tokens.
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:21:21
That's the ticket.   It's nice to be part of such a great community.  Thanks everyone for your constructive and helpful suggestions
@_date: 2019-04-16 10:35:02
Thx, checking now.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:56:36
 thank you for your detailed response.  You are good for crypto. 
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:39:26
I would set it up at 10% or higher.  I hate missing a pump and only realizing it happened 1/2 way through the following dump
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:03:26
I think I understand, basically the hardware wallet uses the seed as the integer to decrypt the private key, which Ledger holds in a crypted form.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:57:40
So then if that's the case, what if I lose my Hardware wallet? Obviously the seed and in turn the private Keys must be stored somewhere. Otherwise the loss would be irreversible
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:55:20
The seed unlocks the key.... it is not the actual key number.  So ledger must maintain storage of keys to be able to restore them 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:20:07
I guess I got caught up with the hype. I did not do my research. If I lose my money, I suppose I deserve it. I was hoping to get some positive feedback from the group but it doesn't seem like that is the case.
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:29:54
So if the company does not maintain your private keys, and you flush your Ledger down the toilet accidentally, how can you get your coins back?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:37:44
Tenx looks great.  One problem,  it is not allowed for USA. Now what?  Maybe someone in Canada will partner with me to use their Canadian address to mail a TenX card to? I am sure the arrangement could earn them some bitcoin. Anyone? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:46:13
Great on gas though
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:25:50
Fantastic reply.   I doubt there is any more discussion necessary on the topic,  :)
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:06:02
What keep a hardware wallet company from accessing your private keys?
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:22:09
I am proud of you and completely inspired by your work. I strive to be more like you, let's spread the word about the most disruptive technology in human history.
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:53:11
I love it.  So tell us where you got it.... 2.50?
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:50:51
I saw it at Wendy's yesterday so it's pretty recent. I only took a picture of the back but the jeep was pretty damn sweet. It's lifted high on big ass tires
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:54:17
You don't lock in your losses until you sell. Have strong hands my friend
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:52:08
Maybe I wasn't clear enough. If the government issues a bank holiday, how would I be able to convert my crypto into something I could buy groceries and gas with? Has anyone thought of this?
