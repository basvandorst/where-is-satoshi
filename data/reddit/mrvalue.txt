Great work! I tried to create some lightning invoices and the interface looks really nice and clean. Do you have any estimate for when you think you are ready to release the mainnet version? Would love to try it out with some real satoshi's :)

This is an old myth, it is only true if you define pollution in a very narrow sense (comparing a subset of the pollutions when burning raw oil with pollutions that are not present when burning refined oil in car engines). The ENTIRE shipping industry only accounts for 2.7% of the total carbon dioxide output in the world. Compare it with the car industry that accounts for about a third of the carbon dioxide. Obviously it would make a huge difference if we all switched to electric cars. 
And also, the claim that it would take more oil to build the car than what the car consumes during its lifetime is so absurd that I can only assume that you work in the oil industry. If your career depends on that you keep fighting against a more sustainable world, maybe you can find some moral support here [stop Tesla](
