You need to encode your callback url. 
Example:        
    $invoice = uniqid();      
    $secret = "MakeUpAPassword";     
    $myCallback = "      
    $url = "     
    $json = json_decode(file_get_contents($url), true);     
    $response = $json["input_address"];     
So if you want to test it on their Check Callback Response Log, you need to paste in the parameters as well, meaning you would need to know the invoice # which could be tricky unless you stored it on a database.     
Instead of testing it with them, create a callback page and test it on your site.   Create a callback.php page and have it create a text document. Use the GETs to fill the text file. 
    $create = "test.txt";     
    $open = fopen($create, "w");     
    $tx = $_GET["input_transaction_hash"];     
    $amount = $_GET["value"];     
    $invoice = $_GET["invoice"];     
    $string_to_write = "tx: ".$tx." amount: ".$amount." invoice: ".$invoice;     
    fwrite($open, $string_to_write);     
    fclose($open);    
    if($tx){      
    echo "*ok*";     
    }     
Then send a payment to one of the input addresses it creates from your initial call. Check your server and you should have a new txt file with the above info.

Green = input, Red = output, Yellow = input+output, Blue = transaction
When you see them being pulled together it's an output from transaction A that has become an input from transaction B, and basically visualizes transaction association in real-time.  Kind of cool, thanks for sharing the link, haven't seen it before!

What have you tried so far?
Doesn't bitcoinjs allow a 80 character buffer in the OP_RETURN with the transactionBuilder() function?
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:41:25
Previous BIP32 solutions I've tried have had issues with the look-ahead gap. After a certain amount of new addresses generated without receiving payment then it doesn't register future payments. I've never heard of Synala but I will check it out, thanks!      
EDIT: Just noticed it requires bitcoin core to run on your server. Although that's not an issue for me, it is an issue for a lot of my viewers that are looking for simple solutions.

By this logic only &lt;10% can responsibly and safely hold bitcoin, which I believe is overly generous. This doesn't kill bitcoin as long as us &lt;10% technically elite continue to use it and value it. It only makes bitcoin that much more specialized which could even increase it's value.  
Possible future scenario? Bitcoin in 10 years: Vast majority of bitcoins have been mined and distributed. Block reward is only 3 BTC, making it difficult for newcomers to build a large stock-pile. Everyone now knows it's valuable and scarce, but the hardest part is using and keeping it.  Previous large holders that were non-technical have lost their funds to exchange negligence, coercion, embezzlement, theft, etc.  Currently the only major and long term holders are old school bitcoin geeks that were able to safely hold their keys.  The new wealthy and technically savvy elite.

Yes. 
Blockchain.info is a great source for free API services, but they are still catching up in the BIP32 HD world. 
Instead I'd recommend a block explorer like smartbit who has been all over BIP32 for a while now.     
Check out their API page:

Desirable? Absolutely. But I agree with your original thought that this is unrealistic for the other &gt;90%. There have been attempts to make it more wide-stream friendly with sites like coinbase, changetip and onename - but all these solutions take the keys away from their users putting us right back in the legacy custodial model.

@_date: 2016-04-13 04:24:42
Make sure you are paying attention to inputs and outputs. Since your first transaction has several outputs you need to narrow it down to which output you're looking for. You're amount is there in Satoshi.

Hey Christian, 
  Trying to get this to work and I'm getting command not found when trying to run lightningd after building on ubuntu. Bitcoind is full synced and has txindex=1 and am able to communicate with the node successfully with bitcoin-cli. Then I follow the steps on the lightningd github. 
     sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake build-essential git libtool libgmp-dev libsqlite3-dev python python3 net-tools
     git clone 
     cd lightning
     make
Took a few minutes or so to build and then after the build is complete I do 
     lightningd --network=bitcoin --log-level=debug
This is where I get command not found. I know mainnet is discouraged but I'm trying mainnet for the lightning stickers offered by blockstream.

Why do you want to import? You should not be reusing addresses. Once you are ready to move funds off of the paper wallet use the sweep feature, or move the funds off the paper wallet using samurai wallet which started supporting sweeping funds from segwitaddress.org back in November 
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:01:48
Hi author here. 64 is a hex private key. A private key with a length of 52 is a Wallet Import Format private key and is not only the default private key produced by the bitcoin core wallet, but is also one of the most popular private key formats. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:03:16
Hi, I'm the author of segwitaddress.org. It was built with the bitcoinjs library which is a trusted library used by many trusted wallets such as GreenAddress. Paperwallets are intended for single usages, which is why there's the sweep feature to spend all the funds once you are ready. If my site disappears for some reason samurai wallet has integrated the same sweeping feature to their wallet. So you can be sure that when you are ready to take the funds off your paper wallet you can just use the sweep feature or use samurai wallet. I hope that helps. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:01:09

@_date: 2018-01-12 05:32:16
I answered this below in response to another reply but basically it's because the private key is all you need. The address can be generated from the private key through cryptographic functions. These are one way functions so that the private key can not be reverse solved from the address. It's more complicated than that but this is ELI5.  You can look up elliptic curves and asymmetric cryptography if you want to get technical. Actually computerphile does a decent intro here 
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:49:36
Hi, author here. Private keys for segwit or legacy addresses are the same. If you import a private key into a legacy wallet it will show you the corresponding legacy address (starting with a one). I don't know if any wallets allow importing of single private keys to segwit addresses. The wallet would just need to generate the redeemscript based off the public key and would then result in the same segwit address you see on the site. It will just take time before wallets start defaulting to segwit for everything. SamouraiWallet integrated so that you can sweep funds from segwitaddress.org but that's all I know of so far. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:11:38
I agree. I'm a huge proponent of segwit, but I am no fan of pressure tactics. Segwit adoption will win because it's the best technical solution we have to scale, not because we shamed companies into using it. It's in their best interest to adopt it, it will just take time.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:24:30
It's not a password, it's a private key. The association is known that the key belongs to the address because of asymmetric cryptography. Because of this you really only need to save the private key, the public key and the address can be generated from the private key.    
    
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:15:55






Bitcoin allows so that "coins" can be sent to ANY valid address, they do not need to prove that they have the corresponding private key. This makes it so that it is possible to "burn" coins by sending them to a made up address with a valid checksum like 1bitcoineateraddressdontsendf59kue. No one has this private key so you can send funds there but they can never be spent. But if you create a key pair offline you can not only send funds to the address, but you can then later spend those coins because you actually have the private key to that address. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:07:06
LN is a layer on top of bitcoin, so it could be used on an altcoin assuming the altcoin supports time locked multisig transactions to create and close the channels.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:48:43
I created it with bitcoinjs combined with a fork from BIP32JP's segwit repo 
Use it offline to create keys, and do not reuse addresses after sweeping them and you'll be safe. 
The best way is to download it and run it on your machine to avoid any sites trying to phish or pretend to be segwitaddress.org -- download from the github releases: 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:29:47
Would you use segwitaddress.org if I added bech32 support?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:42
You would have multiple inputs. Most wallet software isnt clear about inputs and outputs to the user, usually to make it less confusing to mew users. One transaction can have many inputs from many addresses which will require multiple signatures, it increases the size of the transaction and therefore the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:25:19
 Save the wallet.dat to another device immediately in case something happens so you have more than one copy.  Then download bitcoin core, and install. Run it for a little while and then kill the process.  Then go to your %appdata% roaming folder and put in your old wallet.dat file in the bitcoin directory replacing the new one that was just created on the first launch. At that point you should be able to relaunch and follow the steps in this video, or you can just let it do it's thing takes 48 hours or so with no interruptions to sync.﻿
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:43:28
Thanks. You are not sending anything to coinb.in, that site is simply a visual way of building raw transactions. This demonstration is for intermediate and advanced users as it requires understanding of how utxos and transactions work. You can not perform this "trick" on coins that were sent to coinbase unfortunately, you need to have control of the keys on the receiving end to do this. It works best as a merchant if someone pays a decent amount where it would be worthwhile to incur a cost but with a really low fee, the merchant can push it through it they decide to front a bigger fee to pay for the weight of the inputs from the original transaction and the new one. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:38
and 
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:03:50
Like BIP 106?
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:05:34


No, because that's not how hierarchical deterministic wallets work. They don't send coins to a single address -- it generates new key pairs for each transaction, but in a deterministic way so that you only need to store the master key and then your wallet software can solve for the rest of the future keys in the key chain. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:54:45

@_date: 2015-06-08 19:57:36
A lot of people might laugh at you if you ask about non-profit mining. However non-profit mining can still be fun and/or educational. 
If you want to play the lottery or just have fun by learning how to mine and how it works, you can finish your bitcoin core syncing and then in the help/debug/console type   setgenerate true  
Violla you are now mining, type    getmininginfo    and you'll see your abysmal hash rate. You will probably be hashing at 1 - 10 mh/s.  Want to increase that to 333mhs? Spend $15 on an old block erupter on ebay. Still nowhere close to being profitable, but at least you'll have a full node and that helps verify transactions and supports the network. Good luck!

Exactly, you should just buy your own. Bitwage is a useless middleman.  I really don't see any purpose.
Someone responded to my post, they can buy a % of BTC with your paycheck. I can do this myself.
Someone else responded that they can turn their monthly income into daily income using real time paychecks. This sounds like a budgeting issue. What's the difference between receive a $2,000 paycheck every two weeks or $200 every working day other than self discipline? 
Bitwage seems useless to me.

While you read about it keep in mind there are a lot of misconceptions about Bitcoin out there.  
1. There is no CEO of Bitcoin.
2. Bitcoin is not a company or owned by anybody, it's a technology like email.
It is the newest, easiest and best way to transfer money online. I can send you $5 without knowing your name, address or anything about you. Sure you can do similar with paypal but the fees with paypal are enormous.  
I'm in California, I don't know where you are, but you could be in France as far as I know and I can send you $5 instantly.

Read up on it if you're not sure. I don't own any Ripple and I don't plan to.  I believe the biggest downfall is that Ripple is a company with a CEO. That company will own half of all Ripples (XRP) that will ever exist, or half the market cap. So if you buy in your are in a sense making this company more wealthy by giving XRP value. There is no mining yet every transaction incurs a small fee similar to bitcoin however this fee is collected by... yup you guessed it, the company Ripple. Could Ripple be the Apple, Sony or WalMart of money? Perhaps, but I'm not putting my money on it.

You're not going to make anything mining bitcoin this way but it can be fun to learn how the process works. Maybe browse the Altcoin Announcements on bitcointalk and start mining a new coin and get lucky.

"No wallet actually checks"
If a specific wallet service did check, and one time it does pop up and say "this one has been used before" then no one would ever use that wallet service because its randomness generation script must be bugged.

When you look at the single coin cost it seems like it's going to take a lot to make it up to 10,000 or $20,000. But when you look at the market cap you can see how it can easily get to 10, 20 or $100,000 per coin.

An attacker would have your public key(1), this *maybe* an issue well into the future when considering advancements in quantum computing. Also it doesn't happen much anymore, but poorly built wallets have re-used R values in the past when signing which can actually reveal your private key (2). Best thing to do, is keep your cold storage cold. If you spend, move your funds to a new address that hasn't been used before.

You're right it doesn't make sense for the average user to buy bitcoin in order to purchase something. There are however several places that offer discounts if you pay in bitcoin. Not too long ago Alienware had a nice deal. People like to save money. If they have to buy Bitcoin to save 10, 20 or 30% they are going to do it. I mean people pay groupon to save money and groupon only has one use, you can't crowd fund or donate or tip someone across the globe with groupon.

No, unless you don't need that 16k. It's much better to accumulate a fixed amount every week or month instead of trying to time the market. If you use extra funds you don't care about you won't care when the price plunges by 50%. Yes the price could sky rocket as well and you'll end up with less coins, but I still think a repeating fixed accumulation is better long term. Good luck.

Nobody wants to give you an answer, welcome to Download poolers CPU miner, sign up with a pool preferably a small time alt coin and see how much you make. You'll likely only get a couple valid shares per round and collect ~100 satoshis a day. The pool will have a minimum cashout requirement of around 0.01 BTC (1,000,000 satoshis). So you can see the minimum cashout requirement will make it pointless as it would take you 10,000 days to reach the minimum cashout amount.

You just listed the most dramatic and contentious topics in bitcoin. You'll likely just become a nerd in debate instead of bitcoin if you focus on those. Instead if you want to become a bitcoin nerd take a look at Public/Private Key Cryptography, Mining bitcoin with pen &amp; paper, how to create private keys offline or with dice, creating &amp; signing transactions, what are unspent outputs, and why are primes important in cryptography. 


 
Close they are a mining pool. A bunch of people agree to put all their hash power to a single source to increase their chances of finding a block as a community. The reward is then divided up among the miners based on how much computation they provided.     


Blocksize is 1MB. Increasing it might make things faster, it also might make it so that less people run full nodes. Most people don't use bitcoin because they want "fast transactions" Visa already does this fine, Bitcoin is useful because it is permissionless and decentralized. Fast would be nice, but it shouldn't be a priority. This is my opinion.

The redeem script is created when you create the multisig address. You can recreate it you have public keys that were used to create the multisig address. 
Take note it must be in the same order. So if you created the multisig address with 3 pub keys in the order 1-2-3, you must do the same to get the correct redeemscript. If you do 1-3-2 or any other order you will end up with a different multisig address and redeemscript.

Not necessarily. You could open bitcoin core and while it's still syncing you can open the console and type

A single private key can create a legacy P2PKH address (starts with a 1), or a P2SH wrapped segwit (starts with a 3), or a native segwit address (starts with a bc1). Here's a quick video I did showing how to import a private key specific to the type of address you want. Remember, one private key can be many addresses, it all depends what the default is set for the wallet you are using.

Segwit allows for larger blocks without hard-forking to increase the block-size. A common misconception is that it makes transactions smaller, it doesn't. It just moves the data elsewhere. Segwit also fixes transaction malleability and paves the way for layer 2 implementations like lightning network. It's one of the largest changes to the bitcoin code base.

So first of all I want to say Chris Ellis' project is great and I support all his efforts. Also I hope he can find healing against his recent ailments. 
Using a raspberryPi as a full node does have some draw backs.  If you want to be able to rely on your node as a server, a raspberryPi will often crash when the mempool builds up, only 1 GB of RAM doesn't go very far.  I have found buying a refurbished Dell tower with 4GB-6GB of RAM for $60-$80 to be much more powerful and reliable. Yes it will use more power, but personally I have found re-purposing an old desktop or buying a refurb desktop tower on Amazon a cheaper and more reliable choice for when running a node at home. This is what I do, and I also run a webserver on the same machine for different web projects and I hook it up to my tv so it can act as a media server as well to stream movies, etc. It will be noisiest during the initial blockchain sync, but after that they quite down.

You're welcome. I thinks it's good for others to learn about P2SH addresses as all segwit addresses are P2SH addresses. In order for segwit to make any scaling improvements people will need to store and spend with P2SH-P2WPKH addresses. At least wallets will do this for their users but us paper wallet folks will need to "roll our own" so to speak.

As someone who bought the top in 2013, I kept putting in what I could afford. The following two years I was in the red, my wife thought I was insane for buying $50-$100 per month. We got into several fights about it. It was a terrible bear market, lots of FUD about scaling, no good news ever helped the price. My investment only turned positive in 2016. During the bear market there were times that I thought I should quit, that I had missed out and we would never see prices over $1k again. Its been a long road.

If you look at the dotcom era and compare it, there are many similarities to the altcoin world and ICOs. New dotcom companies would IPO at $30 a share, have zero profits, shoot up to $200 a share in a single day and then would be worthless 6 months later. Bitcoin is the internet of the dotcom boom, not one of the worthless companies. The altcoins are the trash IPOs that made the dotcom bubble, a bubble.

This post holds truth. I use a similar method and have been buying every month for over three years with extra money I have left over. I have no emotion when the price drops and although it's exciting watching it go up I have no temptation to cash out. It's like a savings account except I own my money and I'll earn more than any bank can offer. 
The side effect is you might feel left out (initially)when people brag how much coin they have. Only putting in what you can afford means you'll accumulate slower than those that dump a lump sum all at once. The latter folks get emotional on price drops because that lump sum is very important to them. I prefer the slow and emotion-less approach.
Good post OP.

From a creativity and coolness point of view it's a neat idea. But from a security point of view it's terrible. Pretty much like a brainwallet, the chance for collision is too high. Only 12 notes to pick from and diatonic major or minor scales(it sounds "good") would be more likely chosen reducing notes to 7 or even 5 for the pentatonic. 
Maybe try converting the way you make a private key with dice, with notes. Pick out 6 notes and give each note labels 0-5 then come up with a key length of 99 notes. Then you'll have 99 numbers 0-5 (02031042002...) which will be your base6 private key (99 characters [0-5]). You can then convert that to an address and a WIF key with a python library( or just paste into bitaddress under "wallet details" tab. 99 random notes might be hard to remember though, you could do 33 instead and play it three times but that greatly reduces entropy. So yea you could make a melody into a private key or a seed but it's probably not a good idea unless you do 99 random notes but then that defeats the purpose of making it easier to remember than 12 words.

You mean if after the 95% activation is reached then all the miners decide to flip back to older versions pre-segwit? That would be counter to what miners would want to do.

A popular use case in first world countries is being able to use your money how you see fit. Gambling is deemed selectively illegal in the United States. The government doesn't want people to be able to gamble at 2:1 odds on an online casino, yet they are okay allowing citizens to get ripped-off by terrible odds offered through state lotteries. It might seem silly, but I believe the gambling use case will have a large pull in nations that try to control how citizens spend their money. In developing countries they stand to gain much more. They can have a bank account in their pocket and they are able to pay another person directly without having to rely on a bank system. All they need is a smart phone.

If someone spends from a P2WPKH address to a legacy address it will still be a successful transaction. Yes it will show up in your old SPV wallet. No, old nodes, or wallets that are not segwit compatible are unable to properly validate the transaction as it doesn't know where to look for the signature data. The signature data to an old node/wallet will be blank but valid showing that anyone can spend. It's a hack to make old nodes think they are still validating away, while the "majority" of nodes will be doing the verifying of the actual sig data which is why there's a 95% signal to activation rate.

That's a terrible way to think of it. It's like thinking littering is okay because everyone else isn't going to stop. Everyone needs to use segwit for it to be helpful on the network.

Example for 2 of 3 multisig.
     
1. Generate 3 new key pairs using an offline saved version of bitaddress.org. Save/print your private keys. Don't jump back and forthr between compressed and non-compressed. Pick one and stick with it for the entirety of the creation and spending for this address.     
2. For each address you generate, make sure you go over to the 'wallet details' tab, paste in the private key and save the resulting `Public Key` (not the address). This is where you need to pay very close attention to the order of your public keys.       
3. Using an offline saved version of coinb.in go the menu `New`-&gt;MultiSig address.  Paste in each Public Key you saved, again pay very close attention to the order.  Creating a multisig with 3 public keys can result in 6 different multisig addresses and redeem scripts depending on the position of each public key during the creation process. This is important because in order to spend from a multisig address you need the redeem script. If you ever lose your redeem script you can regenerate it as long as you put the public keys in the same order -- which again is the order is important. Click save or submit and it will respond with your new multisig address and redeem script.     
4. You now have a paper multisig. 
Spending    
1. You can do this with the bitcoin core client in the debug console or with coinb.in.  The core client method is for advanced users as it requires command line raw transactions. Lots of people who don't know how to properly create change addresses have lost lots of money trying to fake it through raw transactions.  I'm going to do the coinb.in method, if you really want the core client method you can watch this tutorial (      
2. In coinb.in [ONLINE] go to menu 'New' -&gt; Transaction. Paste in your multisig redeeem script that has the funds you want to spend in the first box.  Then click 'Load" button to fetch available UTXO (aka your balance).     
3.  Down below paste in the address you want to send to and the amount. ANY AMOUNT LEFTOVER WILL GO TO A MINERS FEE SO ITS VERY IMPORTANT TO CREATE A SECOND OUTPUT ADDRESS IF YOUR NOT SPENDING THE FULL BALANCE.      
4. Any amount leftover will go towards a miners fee so it's very important to create a second output address if your not spending the full balance. Yes I wrote this twice on purpose.      
5. Use the (+) button to add a second output that we can use as a change address. In the gray box below it will show you how much is being spent as a miners fee, use that to calculate how much change you want to send back to yourself using another address that you own.     
6. Click 'Submit' and copy the hash it responds to you with. This is your raw unsigned transaction hash.     
7.  Now go offline. Using a saved version of coinb.in [OFFLINE] go to menu 'Sign'. In the second larger box paste in the unsigned transaction hash you copied on step 6.     
8. In the first smaller box paste in one of your private keys that belongs to your multisig. Click 'Submit' and copy the hash it responds to you with. This is your partially signed transaction hash.    
9.   Back on the same sign page, in the second larger box paste in the partially signed transaction hash you copied on step 8.  In the first smaller box paste in another one of your private keys that belongs to your multisig (don't use the same private key you used on step 8). Click 'Submit' and copy the hash it responds to you with. This is your signed transaction hash and is ready for broadcast.     
10.  Go to the `Verify` tab and paste in your signed transaction hash so that you can review everything before broadcasting. If everything looks accurate go the 'Broadcast' tab, paste in the signed transaction hash and submit. Coins spent.

There are several ways. Easiest is to generate a new key pair on each order and save the private key. This obviously comes with risk storing a private key on your server, so others will use a BIP32 xpub, and generate new addresses that way. These can have gap issues which sometimes makes it difficult to locate received funds. Or you can pre-generate 10,000 key pairs offline and save the keys. Then just cycle through each address on your site for each new order.

It's almost like this   Just replace California with Internet and Gold with Bitcoin. Seriously you will see a lot of parallels, wait until you hear about "gold grease", talk about scams!  At this time California was non-governed as gold was discovered 2 days before the end of the Mexican war, it would take many years before a new government could establish. People could sail in dig up some gold and not have to pay any taxes on it.

Bitcoin is the return of a sound money system, like we had during the gold standard. Its supply is limited by cryptography and math. Its value is backed by the energy, hardware and network required to produce new blocks at an ever increasing difficulty. This requires money, so in a way bitcoin is backed by the dollars that flow into it as people see its value and potential.

I think it's good that they put this out a lot of people were freaking out because they were thinking that they were going to sell their original Bitcoins and replace them with S2X coins which clearly is not going to happen. The other part is kind of weird how they mention the most accumulated difficulty.

The derivation path can almost be as important as the seed (it's not, but you need to know it). 
Derivation paths vary from wallet to wallet. One of the consequences of a decentralized project like bitcoin is the lack of a standard. Thankfully most wallets try to get along. 
Bitcoin Core Wallet (node) uses m/0'/0'/i'    
Trezor wallet uses BIP44 m/44'/0'/0'/0/0    
Some use BIP49 m/49'/0'/0'/0/0    
and some use BIP84 m/84'/0'/0'/0/0     
     
The same seed will produce different key pairs for each derivation path, so it's important to know your derivation path if you plan to hold for eternity because your currently preferred software might not exist anymore.

Blockchain is a private company. In Satoshi's whitepaper he says "a chain of blocks", and "blocks are chained" and "proof-of-work chain", to describe a series of sequential hashes. In fact, he never says blockchain once. He says proof-of-work chain 3 times. When you hear blockchain people are usually referring to the longest proof-of-work chain. Over the last few years bankers who didn't want to admit they were interested in bitcoin went under the guise of "blockchain technology" so they wouldn't get laughed at by the big guys upstairs. It's since become a hype word used on resumes by consultants who know very little of the technical aspects behind proof-of-work.

It helps to understand how transactions work. 
I use a fee of 0.00001 and it confirms fine, but that's because I know the size of my transaction is small.  A larger transaction needs a larger fee.  One should not expect a 15kb transaction to cost the same as a 600 byte transaction.

I'm not sure about using the word 'fake' but the fact that they are mainly new nodes and not core converting says a lot. Also the hash power that mined the classic block is being crowdfunded. The two combined point to an unsustainable adoption.  New nodes are unlikely to remain online for long, otherwise they would have been online prior.  Same principle goes with the hashing.

I agree with the thought that to go mainstream we can't have every end-user know and understand public private key cryptography. It would be foolishly unrealistic to think otherwise. One of the tricky parts is in order to see the benefits of using bitcoin, you need to be able to understand why and how you are the true owner of your money. So how do you make it easy for the typical person, yet have them feel empowered by using it?  Since you used the Ford Focus example, what's the benefit to the end-user of using a car? To get from A to B quickly on your own, they don't need to understand the combustion engine to understand the benefits of travel. Maybe we can focus on another benefit of bitcoin that doesn't require weeks of research to understand the benefits. Perhaps the deflationary growth, but right now it's too volatile to be appeasing to the public as a savings account. I agree there's something that will need to be created to convey clear benefits to typical users.

I remember reading posts like these in 2014 and 2015 as morale boosters. They still make me feel bullish and that bitcoin is still cheap at $8500. People that acted pro bitcoin the last 6 months only to run away at a price crash make me laugh. If you can manage to accumulate 1 coin or even 0.1btc and hold it for 10 years you will have a lot of purchasing power. Bitcoin investing requires an iron stomach, but it's easy to get an iron stomach if you can grasp a firm understanding of how and why Bitcoin works.  Once you've crossed this mental threshold you realize the price today or tomorrow doesn't matter, you just know you must accumulate as much as you reasonably can before wide spread adoption.

This always makes me wonder ... I'm not sure if beginners should use HD wallets, there's always a lot of confusion about the derivation methods (some wallets use different methods, some use bip32 or bip44) and theres the gap/look ahead issue. They write down recovery words, when instead I think they should be understanding/learning what an xpriv key is and how to derive the Nth key in a chain, and what's the difference between m/0/0/1 and m/0/1/1. Being able to be self sufficient in funds recovery should be something people should strive for before putting a bunch of value in the key(s).

That would be a change to the consensus rules and require a hard fork. Doesnt matter if "core" does it or not, the hard fork is caused by changing consensus critical code.   It's been debated a long time and then a clever developer found a way to increase the blocksize with out having to hard fork so it was adopted  (segwit).  So you have to wonder what the motivation is behind these folks that want to intentionally split the network. Is it money and it power? Probably.

Thanks! This actually this turned out to be the link/code that led me to solve my questions. 
- Need bitcoin core
- Need (3) 66 character public addresses you can get this with bitaddress.org
- execute the code in bitcoin core console
    createmultisig 2 '["a","b","c"]'
Inside each double quotes **instead of a b or c** enter in each of the public 66 char addresses. This will create a new multisig public address in your bitcoin core wallet. 
Now the hard part is sending from the wallet, you have to create a raw transaction and then sign two raw transactions. Looks like I have some learning to do... Anyways, thanks for leading me on the correct path! $1

I never pay attention to those weird 12 word seed things for exactly this reason. Every bitcoin address (publickey) 1jdkdfo....... has a corresponding private key (5dpfokkf7.....).

Can you provide the tx id? It might at dust levels where the fee costs more than the amount available + the amount you are trying to send.
Also with importing in bitcoin core are you using: `importprivkey L1rRoATFPx7oGtidtNZSLnrzmCGrcwkGhWLAcRPhjaz1GAW66RPe`      
or whatever your private key is? Are you sure it's a null response or is it just loading? When importing a private key it has to reindex which can take quite a while.

You could create your own page that fetches the current price via public market APIs and then convert it to an image using canvas. 
Here's something I threw together really quick. It's a simple way to do it with PHP and JavaScript: 
However since it's canvas you won't be able to put it in a forum. 
There's this thread on bitcointalk, that you can embed the live price as an image in a BB style forum, but it's not coinbase.

These moves have all been predictable, and has made it so that 5 out of my 6 trades in April were profitable, only one small loser.  I'm not a manipulator, nor a future teller, just following basic market trend and structure analysis. The only indicator I used was the RSI on one trade when I shorted at 469 after the triple fail to make new highs combined with bearish divergence on the RSI.  I'm not trying to insult you, but it takes some time to learn how to read the market properly.  New traders are going to lose money, that's just a fact and we've all been there at some point.

Your transaction has 11 inputs. Inputs are the "heaviest" part of a transaction at 180 bytes per input. Then you decided you pay an outrageous 350 satoshis per byte fee. 
    11*180 + 44 = 2024     
    2024 * 359 = 726616 satoshis in fees
You did this to yourself.

It's not worth it man. Pay the capital gains tax. Otherwise the IRS will find out in a few years after you think you're in the clear and they'll put on a lien on your house. Liens are non-dischargable in bankruptcy so if you don't pay they'll take your house. If you really really don't want to pay, take out a cash advance on a credit card and pay the capital gains with the borrowed funds, then default on the card. At least credit card debt is dischargable in BK and you don't risk losing your home. But don't let the BK trustree know what you did with the cash advance money or they'll throw out your case.

When broadcasting the original transaction you are sending a signed transaction hash to a bunch of nodes. Anyone with that signed hash can re-broadcast assuming the included unspent outputs are still unspent.  You could double-spend the outputs with a higher fee, but it's rather technical.

Since you do not want to use any 3rd party API, running a bitcoind node with JSON-RPC API will have to be your pick. You can prune it to save on disk space. If you can't run a node ...  there's also the approach of generating a bunch of addresses offline, dump all the addresses in a database, and then assign one to each invoice, then just check your wallet from time to time for new payments and then process orders manually by checking the receiving address to the corresponding invoice number.

Realization that bitcoin is useful, and isn't going anywhere. Most of heard about it a few times, dismissed it, only to come back to it later wishing we got on earlier. A recent poll in 2016 by the federal reserve showed that most Americans could not afford a $400 emergency expense. The current hype is accelerating the price because people want their fair share. Most people can't afford to buy a bitcoin right now and it's only going to become more and more expensive to own a whole coin.

Very large transactions.      
When transactions are of typical size you'll see each block will have ~2500 transactions making up ~998kbytes.     
What we are seeing is about 1500 transactions per block lately, but they're also taking up 998 kbytes.     
This could be a coincidence that people are just sending more complex transactions at the same time. Or it could be a coordinated effort. I believe it's the latter.

If an address generated is already in use, then something is terribly wrong. The number space that private keys cover is so vast that the chance of there ever being a collision is so microscopically low that it's basically impossible. That's how they are created offline, because a private key is basically just a very large random number -- as long as it was generated with true randomness there is nothing to worry about.

We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.
For transferable proof of work tokens to have value, they must have monetary value. To have monetary value, they must be transferred within a very large network - for example a file trading network akin to bittorrent.
To detect and reject a double spending event in a timely manner, one must have most past transactions of the coins in the transaction, which, naively implemented, requires each peer to have most past transactions, or most past transactions that occurred recently. If hundreds of millions of people are doing transactions, that is a lot of bandwidth - each must know all, or a substantial part thereof.

No you're not alone.  
I treasure my bitcoin stash more than my fiat savings.  
There's just something about holding an appreciating asset, there aren't many of them anymore.   
I'll think to myself oh I could pay this off or buy a new car lime you said, but when I think into the future I don't think I will have trouble getting a car or paying bills. However I imagine I will not be able re-accumulate the same or more BTC in the future so I'd rather hold onto the item that is more rare/hard to get. And although it is a meme, I agree with "when it's time to sell, you won't have to". Things have just started. There's still 12 new coins every ten minutes. What about in 11 years when it's only one per block? HODL.

I'd suggest you don't buy a few thousand dollars worth unless that is money you can afford to lose. If the price falls by 50%+ in a few days, will you still be okay?  Personally I chose to buy frequently in smaller amounts, instead of buying infrequently in large amounts.

Yes I love their api as well, very easy to use. One snag is its not really free, you have limited usage on the free plan. After generating 100 addresses you must upgrade to a paid plan or if you want to use webhooks you need a paid plan as well. I suppose it's only a matter of time before all wallet apis become paid subscriptions, and I don't blame them... just look at how much you will spend running a VPS with bitcoind json-rpc.

It will auto recognize the type of key you are trying to enter.
A hex key is 64 characters
example: afe59fd646b2a95adf15711b59fb8095778c534d497d6bc0ace91ec1e9a80b59
a base 6 key is 99 in length with numbers 0-5 (this is how you make a key with normal dice, substituting 6's with 0's)

For shared hosting you are best off using a 3rd party api like blockchain, blocktrail or BlockCypher. The easiest of the 3 is blockchain receive payments api. You need an API key. But it's free and there are tutorials online on how to use it if you Google it.

INTERPOL proving they are complete idiots. Yea you can put anything in the blockchain, but it doesn't put an actual executable malware file on the users computer. As I understand in order for malware to actual infect a machine you would have to parse that paticular block with said malware with a block parser and then run it. INTERPOL makes it sound like "add a virus to the blockchain now every full node is infected. Muwahaha!". Bitcoin would have died long ago if that were the case.

What a bogus announcement. I disagree completely, belcher for some reason wants to convince everyone of his opinion. Everyone has a different preferred storage method -- this is not worthy of an announcement. 
"We who are knowledgeable about bitcoin cannot stay silent on this any longer. "      
     
What an arrogant thing to say. I've been using paper wallets since 2013, have built my own wallets, published a book on development, and have a commit to bitcoin core, it was merely a documentation change, but that still puts me in a pretty narrow category of being "knowledgeable about bitcoin" and I disagree with his statement. You can't speak for everyone like that, "all the smart people know that this opinion is right", no they aren't and no they don't.  Belcher's opinion is he likes HD wallets, and he dislikes single key management. It's not for everyone. Fine. This "announcement" is him trying to assert some authority because he's a mod. 
He goes further to push his preferences by discounting paper wallets entirely because they are usually written in a language that he doesn't work with. Belcher should consider politics if he's into pushing beliefs as facts.

Creator of segwitaddress.org here.    
What kind of address did you generate bech32 or p2sh-p2wpkh?      
What app are you using to scan your private key?
I'm not sure what method blockchain.info uses but they have not been very segwit friendly. Blockchain info is likely only checking the private key against the legacy addresses, the not segwit addresses. One private key can correspond to several address types.  
Samourai wallet supports QR code scanning of private keys created from a paper wallet on segwitaddress.org.    
Alternatively you can import to electrum.

Reducing pool of potential customers, absolutely. 
Processing credit cards can be a total pain and a HUGE overhead for a site that processes payments for photos.  The 3rd party payment processors don't just charged a % per transaction but they also charge a monthly fee regardless the number of sales. They also check credit reports and reserve the right to suspend service at anytime. So what if you have less than perfect credit and want to sell your homemade jam online? Well, you likely won't sell enough to make registering with the payment processor worth it, so people resort to ebay or etsy. This is BTCs strongest point for merchants, you can be up in running in hours with the permission of no one, with zero monthly or per transaction fees.

I have. I believe it's a matter of preference and you believe your preference is right. I have used both HD wallets and paper wallets and I prefer single keys created from dice, instead of an HD seed. I also prefer storage mediums that are not susceptible to data corruption such as the cryptosteel. The only drawbacks I read about against paper wallets come from those that don't know what they're doing and then they lose funds. If people want to play on trezors and be reliant on firmware upgrades then so be it, I'm not going to tell them one way is better than the other, because, like I already said, it's a matter of preference.
