I've had a grand total of four hours of sleep in the past three days, so I may be talking crazy here, but I don't wholly agree with the PayPal argument. I don't think we should be directly comparing bitcoin to PayPal, or marketing it as PayPal's successor. PayPal is not a currency - it's a middleman. An exchange between two currencies, between consumers and vendors. I think perhaps a more apt comparison then would be between PayPal and a large bitcoin exchange like Mt.Gox. We shouldn't aim to compete with an already well-established giant like PayPal, but instead look for an entirely new niche for bitcoin to fill. I think we do bitcoin and the unseen potential behind it a disservice to tout it as just a new kind of online money exchange.

Globally accepted does not mean it will supplant and replace all global currencies. While I'd like to see bitcoin succeed, I think this is a tad farfetched. Certainly not within the next five years.

For $30 more per graphics card, wouldn't it be more economical to get a pair of 5870s for over 850Mhash?
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:29:27
This would be more akin to discovering it's actually a fake, and in fact, only worth $50.
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:04:52
No worries. Your guide is otherwise great; I just don't want people running around thinking thinking their bitcoins are invincible just because the word "encryption" is involved.

I think my original intent was something along the lines of denoting individuals and businesses we *should* trade with rather than blacklisting those we shouldn't, i.e. a literal reverse boycott. But I can see how that would be confusing, and whitelisting every reputable trader would be an impossible task. I was never very good with portmanteaus, anyway. Perhaps something with could be cleverly worked in with the Bitcoin-related dual meaning of "block"?

It's a self-check for people trying to take advantage of a free service. If someone was using a bot to create and farm gmail addresses, there would (in theory) be an obvious trend in the recent sends list and someone could report it.

I dunno, verifier sounds like something out of Tron. It won't be long now..
But the transaction fees will be very small compared to the amount of the actual transactions though, won't they? Not unlike an optional sales tax, the way I see it. Will these very small rewards really be profitable for miners with their multi-thousand dollar mining rigs? Or is it just assumed that if bitcoin still exists by the time the last block is found that the market will be thriving with hundreds of thousands of transactions (and subsequently many transaction fees) per day?

Bitcoins that would otherwise be lost forever (e.g. if the computer your wallet is on crashes) would be "put back" into circulation. Right now, this isn't really an issue since we're still generating coins, but eventually, hypothetically, even eight decimal places of divisibility won't be enough for the fraction of the amount of bitcoins there "should" be.
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:00:41
I'd say BTC Guild is fairly representative, but I'd still be curious to see the other pools. Especially Mt. Red.
@_date: 2011-07-07 18:45:22
If you're still on the fence, mine just showed up today. It did have the makings for a very good scam though.

So because that ratio of odds/payoff is less than 1 in every step, probability dictates that there is no way of making a profit the long run? I guess that's what gambling is, but if I'm interpreting it right, this one doesn't go to any length to disguise the fact that the odds are very against you.

So when do the dancing bananas get here?

But they're likely only accepting them because they can convert them back to USD. The guy who sells alpaca socks can't feed his family with bitcoins.

Out of bitcoin? Better bless my own dildo!

They're [dummy plugs]( They fool the computer into thinking there's an output device plugged in so the GPU can be used without a monitor.
@_date: 2011-06-20 21:28:34
I don't think Bitcoin is limited to the first world, and I really wouldn't be surprised if it gains wide-scale acceptance in mobile phone banking nations like South Africa. There are already [discussions in place]( regarding its adoption. Yes, it's an infrastructure reliant technology, but that infrastructure exists outside of the first world and it certainly wouldn't be impossible to integrate.

Uhh.. you realize this isn't how TrueCrypt handles encryption, right? If you're running the Bitcoin client, **your wallet isn't encrypted.** The Bitcoin client is accessing it. That means it's vulnerable to an attack. The virus that is out now definitely could send the wallet by ftp or any other means, it would just have to look in a different place for it.
@_date: 2011-06-21 23:48:07
I'd love to be optimistic, but I just don't see that happening anytime soon. Ultimately, the guy at the end of the line is just waiting to cash out in some other currency, unless bitcoin replaces every currency in existence.

Yes, but their CPUs aren't running at 100% constantly. There's a surprisingly large increase in power consumption compared to running at idle all day.

Thanks! I've been mining on and off with my 450 MH/s desktop for over a year, which is what even made this investment possible. I wish I had mined continuously since I started, that's my only regret so far - and hopefully I'll look back in a year and regret nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:13:11
It's still showing up in the app store for me, and I used it to send some BTC yesterday... What do you mean they disallowed it?
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:42:06
Worst case scenario, in a few months, I'm going to regret not being brave; best case scenario, in a few months, I'm going to be laughing all the way to the bank.

I accidentally bought it twice. I don't mind at all - I'm happy to support a good cause! But now I have two download links. I'd be happy to give one away (if that's okay with you, of course) to someone!

If nobody is mining bitcoins, bitcoin has bigger problems.

No, the Blockchain mobile wallet app has supported sending and receiving BTC on iOS devices for some time now.

I'm pre-ordering to avoid the many more months of backorders I'm anticipating BFL will experience when ASIC mining becomes the new standard. I'm willing to consider any potential deflationary gains in their favor a generous tip.
