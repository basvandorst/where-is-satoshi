Code review of apps is impossible for **at least** two reasons:
1. All apps submitted to the app store are encrypted binaries that cannot be ripped to view source code (save for headers which are useless).
2. Let's suppose apple ignores number one and has developers start submitting raw source code of their apps. Assuming developers would be ok with this (they won't be) and continue submitting apps, a complete audit of the code would take too long to be profitable for Apple on an app by app basis. Not to mention would it would be of varying difficulty to audit the code based on the developer.

7% is not right at all. Usually you can even specify your own transaction fee when sending BTC.

From first hand experience: It depends on the reviewer reviewing the app for approval. Some will just gloss over the app and let it through while others will go through ever small part of your app and find the smallest things to reject it for. It sounds like when they submitted it, they got a easy reviewer.

Usually they mean if it crashes consistently, not something that happens every so often.
