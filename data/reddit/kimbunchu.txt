In order to fight back successfully, since we’re the underdog, we have to come up with a win win proposal or situation.  Sort of like Neo going to the machine to make a deal in order to rid of Agent Smith. But not exactly, because the elite can go back on their words.

Somehow there’s going to people like me in my youth who don’t care about the fees but just need the BTC right away... how or why a situation like hat will arise, I don’t know.   Maybe they dont have a bank account, a smart phone, etc etc....

Yes but the general public won’t be able to do what you know how to do.  Maybe not “trouble” but I’m thinking the ATM’s are setup for when mass adoption hits.  There will be people that will be more comfortable using  an ATM more than anything else.  I feel the same way that you do. The fees are ridiculous.  But so are the interest rates on payday loans...but there is and will be a market for it.

I agree, there will be more people wanting to save their BTC because it will continue to gain value, than there are people right now wanting to save their cash because it’s doesn’t gain value from just holding. It actually loses value over time. 
I also envision a time where the rich and powerful has a monetary incentive not to depopulate the world. For instance soldiers dying in war or people dying from deseases.   Bitcoin may somehow make this true.

Lol yes sir spelling Po Po.   Yes the price increases, but why would they care, they have all of it, and do nothing with it. The dollar would be highly inflated from all the cash printed or make a bunch of people super rich but that’s the price for control.   Either way early investors will be winners I guess.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:16:57
What if the whales are the Exchanges? And there’re using there control of customers coins to manipulate the market without there customers even knowing? 
Over the years,  as more people continue to buy btc, and hold, the whales control of supply should be continually coming down right?   And it’s reflected on the higher lows of btc.  2017 bottom for btc was what? Below 1000? 2018 bottom was around 3200? So as btc gets spread out among more people coming in, the more stable, and less manipulatable it becomes.
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:58:00

1. You sold $97.01 worth of bitcoin with the intention to withdraw it to your bank.
2. You deposited $97.01 from your bank to your Coinbase account, thinking that you were withdrawing the funds from the sold BTC to your bank.  
3. You withdrew $194.02 to your bank, confused to how your funds are now doubled the value of the BTC you’ve just sold.
Your ok now.  I don’t believe there is a deposit fee from your bank to your Coinbase. The withdraw fee for $194.02 may be the same for half of that.

Hopefully by that time nobody in their right mind would want to trade it for fiat other than it being something antique to collect...
I say it won’t effect the price at all, but move the economy more from it being used.  Maybe we would even just drop fiat comparison values completely. No fiat to trade to.

No it won’t, the higher the price and the more btc is distributed among people around the world , the less volatile it will be.   2017 we saw it go to 20k and dropped all the way to 3200?  That’s 1/6.5.   This ratio will go higher at 50k maybe 1/4.5 about a price of $11,100.  At 80k maybe 1/4,  which is $20k lowest probably.

It’s safe to say that Satoshi is a person or group of conspiracy theorist at the utmost highest logical level, who believes in the secret elite that controls the world using one of the best tools they have, the fiat system.  He understands the need for anonymity and the danger bitcoin poses to his life.
I don’t know Craig or have seen his interviews and his reasons why he chose to go into hiding and then come out but
Does he behave like a conspiracy theorist as described?
Does he possess that level of character and awareness of the highest state of consciousness.
Is Craig prideful? Would he really use name of a person of another race than he?  
Does Craig come across as a noble man?

The point is for us to easily remember and to be able spell them and not make any mistakes.  Versus the remembering and typing the whole key, one little typo and you’re doomed.  One typo on a word and we can still figure out where the mistake is and how to spell it.

@_date: 2018-03-06 00:02:31
Maybe it was recorded two weeks ago and not actually aired til today? Or was this one I saw today was a re-run?
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:38:36
Is bitcoin dying?  It’s so much cheaper than $20k now and you have the same amount of buyers and sellers for the past few months, practically a stalemate.   
You would think people would go wild with these 85% discounts!!!

Ellen talking about bitcoin just aired today? I thought it was a few weeks back.

Was it planned all along to take the gold from the people and then later sell it back to them for more beginning 1975?
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:13:29
Must be that Bull flag!  The lows were getting higher and the highs was hovering around 8k for a while, once the lows meet up with the highs, it’s bound to go up or down and in this case I felt it was gonna go up! Cause we’re in a bull market baby!!!

I can’t see 400k until institutions settle themselves in deep enough for the world to be certain bitcoins here to stay.

No trajectory at all. Just straight free-fall.  Splat. And then bounce.

It works if enough people agree to use it as money. How many people is enough? I’m not sure.    More People are using bitcoin to transfer money now and purchase things than ever before, which is a big step forward

Was that some sort of an attempt to trigger a sell off?
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:32:06
At least he’s not making price predictions anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:52:31
This time it is and will be different. If we slowly climb to 10k, 12k and 15k, it will be a very very good sign.  Much diffrent from the pump and dump of 2017.   Buyers are more calm, and confident...less panic selling, and with Fidelity Etrade and other corporate entities moving in, it's gonna keep climbing steadily.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:44:48
It’s not available on coinbase , is it on Pro?

@_date: 2019-05-21 16:38:29
could be a llittle of  both.   I know i'm more calm, and not panic selling
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:40:20
You’ll need 130 billion dollars right now to double the price to $14,000.  I don’t think anything beyond $300k is possible this year.  Fidelity E*TRADE and such will need to move in and lay the foundation first. Then it can explode. But I doubt it will be this year.  I do see 30-50k possible this year. 
We need a trillion just to get to 60k price.
Thanks , I get it now. I was seeing it wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:02:16
I was thinking along the same line. Somehow this made profit for the ultimate trading pros.  It make sense Right Here to buy what little it took to go up to 9,xxx to trigger the selloff and sell off yourself as well and that will bring the price down to around Here where we would buy what we want at a lower price.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:49:02
For both. Yesterday’s sellers are fairing better than today. Today’s seller is TBD.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:55:31
How do you think this next bullrun will play out?  
I think we’ll hit 10k by  the end of this week , then we’ll move on to 20k just as quick as we moved from 5k to 10k. From 20k we’ll see a pull back to around 15k, and then from there we go to 30k, after that there’s another pullback. From there I don’t know, we could move to 50k sometime this year and we end the bullrun for maybe 6months.  Or maybe 30k will be the ATH for 2019. Hard to say where the ATH will be but I put it at least at 30k.
I think the bear market will be shorter shorter the next few years as adoption seems to be happening.

@_date: 2019-05-26 23:17:38
Do that in a bear market, but not right now...we’ve been heading  up for the last few months, I’d say a peak of 30k btc we would see a major pullback ...but I hope I’m wrong and it’s at 50k instead...
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:40:39
So what can you extrapolate from this...?
