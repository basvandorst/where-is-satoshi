People once thought Ethernet would never possibly scale past 100 Mbps. We see how that worked. All of these fee conversations are irrelevant. I personally think a block size increase will be necessary at some point.  But in the grand schemes block size increases are a joke compared to scaling solutions you'll see in 10-20 years.

None of those things can happen on a ledger.

Someone doesn't know where hodl originated.
I swing trade alts to increase btc position. I don't touch my btc position ever. Nobody knows where the market goes from here. It could go to 8k, it could go up to 15k. I'm not touching my ledger to swing trade BTC.

Re read my comment. I didn't mention kitty coin at all haha

I have both. Just hundreds times more BTC than ETC... haha

You literally don't know why Bitcoin was invented. Key word that gave it away was trust.

Sorry you bought late bro.

I'm comfortable with my position and it's not worth risking timing the market for me personally.

I've already pulled all original investment via profit taking. I will ride this bitch to zero.
Although 20k is more likely than zero at this point.

It's okay bro. This is just natural when you invest more than you can afford to lose. I bought at $3400 before China fud. Saw it hit 5k before tanking to $2800. I holded then I will hodl now.

Your money will go bye bye don't do touch your btc.

Could it be that somebody bought 30 million dollars of Tether and want to buy BTC?

Read the whitepaper first. Google Bitcoin White paper. It's a short read. Even if you're not technical you owe it to yourself to read it if you're going to invest your money.
The best place to buy Bitcoin easily is on Coinbase.
Just search for it on Google. Your USD holdings are FDIC insured and they perform standard KYC/AML. Don't be confused by Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bcash is like the Chinese iPhone Clone of Bitcoin.
If you want a good resource to start to learn about fundamentals. Look up Andreas Antonolopus on Youtube. He's one of the leading academics/thought leaders on Blockchain. 
Don't chase every shiny looking "altcoin" some of them have promise and use case. You'll learn which ones the longer you hang around, and more you learn. Most are shitcoins however. But the biggest noob mistake is going hunting for the next bitcoin when you're two weeks in haha.

This is actually the biggest news for Bitcoin since futures hype. Most people don't know enough about tech to understand that though.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:59:20
I think most of the people in those tweets we're all over this sub Reddit the pervious two weeks. I wonder where they went?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:27:43
Thanks for this. I hope we crash so fucking hard all these sarcastic December noob sellers leave and forget about BTC. Then they check the chart in 2021 and realize they got fucking rekt. I hope we go as low as we need to shake out every single person who is in this for the wrong reasons.

This is a debate for that future generation of hodlers to handle 100 years from now. We've got our own challenges to face.
