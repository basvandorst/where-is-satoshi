I would post your issue on our forum.  We have lawyers that love arbitration that would definitely see it.

Good idea.  This arbitration was in NJ.  So either state may have a record of judgment.

We can't out anybody against their will - and we wouldn't if we had the opportunity.  We're just trying to find the story.  It may have already been told somewhere.  99.99999% of people are completely unaware that they're allowed to share what happens in forced consumer arbitration without a settlement.  It works against the rest of us and aids the wrongdoers.  It's a big reason why businesses force arbitration!

We'd like to highlight the story in a blog post.  Given the claim went to awarded status, it shouldn't be subject to any confidentiality.  Consumer arbitration is not inherently confidential.

Thanks!  We get the data directly from the arbitration forums.

That's what we're trying to find out.
1. It was a consumer suit, not employment-related.
2. There was no in-person hearing so it was done remotely with documents.  135 days total.
3. It was not dismissed, withdrawn or settled, which means evidence was presented to an arbitrator and a decision was made.
There are three completed Coinbase cases so far: 
Of the other two, one was settled and the other withdrawn.
The fact that this case went all the way to a decision could mean a lot of things.  Perhaps Coinbase was refusing to reimburse for filing fees so the consumer held his/her ground and took it to a decision.  Perhaps Coinbase was fighting for other reasons.
It costs Coinbase at least $1,500 in arbitration fees for every case that is filed.  It only costs the consumer $200.  And if there is a hearing, it's at least another $1,500 for Coinbase.  So Coinbase should always agree to fix the problem, refund the consumer's $200 filing fee and request case withdrawal.
Furthermore, when a consumer case goes to a decision, usually none of what happened is confidential.  However, it is up to one of the parties to share details because there is no publicly accessible docket =\
In fact, we're trying to help consumers utilize LPF.io like a docket.  Share information about your arbitration case to help others.
Help us find this person and we'll get the story.

To us, you're right.  We won't share their info publicly without permission.  We deal with a lot of private sources.
The hope here is they see this and reach out.
EDIT: Or maybe they told their story somewhere else - like a forum or something - and someone knows where to point us.

They should fear accountability.  It coerces good behavior.  Having a forced arbitration clause with a class action ban means they can isolate individuals and never really be held accountable without the government getting involved.
This is why we encourage people to share their stories.

Agreed. If we find him or her, they can remain anonymous. Similarly, there may be good business in representing others against Coinbase given so many issues.

Highlighting forced arbitration data is our business.
