Also, with time, It doesn't fit and work how I would like it, as it has many many constraints on it. Mainly I would only get 3600*2 variations, which is approximately 2^12.8, and they have to be varied with lots of constraints, and not everyone would accept the hash if it is at the max allowable time.

I guess I don't fully understand this "flagging a fork" and exactly what it does. Are there any good places to read on exactly what it does?

a bitfield that is 32 bits long, with 2 constraints on those bits?
0xXXXXXXXX must be &gt;2 and the first bit must be zero?

So, the version number now dictates the branch you are on and other information? I think that is what I am reading.
So if you use nVersion as version "4" or version "5", is this no longer accepted by the nodes?

So, you vote on a forking path for longer chains, essentially. So, if I have a miner, I can adjust this number to anything that I want? That is what is sound like.
If this is the case, this would give me another variable to adjust to hit the correct hash. This would give me a ~2^64 options per mining hash setup, as I can try all nonces with a version of 5, then try again with a version of 6, and so on.
Is this not the right way to think about it?

Yes, but I do not what to adjust the merkle root in unexpected ways
@_date: 2016-08-21 16:59:14
What else dictates the "version"? Where can a read up on this?
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:24:16
wouldn't a better solution be to decrease the difficulty, and have a block be found every 5 minutes. Also half the price for finding a solution?
This would allow for less transactions per block/byte per block
@_date: 2016-08-21 13:35:43
So, Can I write a consensus rule that would support this? 
It is already in place to accept any version that is greater than 2 (from what i read).
I guess, how would it break the network?
Also, see my previous comment on 
@_date: 2016-08-21 13:34:02
But... if you delete a transaction or add the "extraConce" like coinbase, you adjust the merkle root in an unexpected way... I want something that keeps the merkle root and the hash algorithm the same, but more variables than 32 that I can adjust.
After reading, the network will accept any version that is greater than 2 and is positive, so would version be something that I could loop over?, Not all bits in the version, Perhaps ~0x00XXXX02, where XXXX would give me another 2 bytes to loop over.  This would enforce that the version is always positive, and that is it always greater than 2. This would give me 2^48 available changes.

To answer you question, I am only looking to solo mining for all the adjustable parameters to solve the problem. I am not looking to solve the problem by solo mining, but to understand all aspects of the problem in place. I have ideas for new more efficient algorithms in finding the solution, but I am at a loss for parsing the transaction chain and what is allowed to be changed to get the solution. Not saying it will ever work, but i do NOT plan on brute forcing the solution. I need a set of allowable changes along with the hashing of the current transactions to build out my new method.

This is your library! I didn't even realize it. Thank you so much for this work.

Please see my response to 
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:09:44
Absolutely! Thank you so much for your time :D
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:12:28
Thank you, This is helpful. I have another book very similar, and will sit and read both if I cannot come up with what is needed otherwise :D
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:11:32
This is helpful, but I am not looking at brute force mining. So I am just in need of how the solo mining works with minimal code, basically a program very similar to "Minimal Bitcoin Miner" but for solo mining. I see that the node parses the transaction chain. I believe that this may put me in the right direction.
Thank you,

This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you! :D Time to get modeling!
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:53:10
thank you for your input. I have a good idea on how to do this, now it is just implementation to test it. Like I said, it may or may not work.
