Depends on how many bits you bought! If it's too less, keep buying and averaging dollar cost so that eventually you'll have enough to move to a safer place(as compared to an exchange) such as electrum wallet or other software wallets. 
You could sell when you think you've made enough profits and you want out! But the golden rule old timers follow is HODL the ATH, buy the dip or whenever you can!
Also yes, you'll incur fees for almost all transactions and they'll vary on different reasons at different times!
All the best :)

Exactly! I'm HODLing and strapped in! Popcorn's ready too!
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:45:38
Honestly speaking, he's right. I'm from India, and as per as tax rules we could manipulate and do this!

People are learning the art of HODLing.

This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:57:25
Brother this is why we hold and instead buy the dip. Holding for long term gets you more dough than trading. Hope you recover you loss man! :)

Since you didn't claim to be a simple man, that makes you one! Kingtut is indeed a simple man

Human greed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:33:05
My understanding is this.
Here in India, an exchange requires the user to register the valid verified residential address of a user. I believe most exchanges abroad too would be requiring the same level or KYC. Thus, only a person holding 2 or more permanent residences can do so.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:16:25
Buy high, Sell low, Sell the dip, hodl the ATH
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:57:38
If and when btc is worth a mil? That would be worth 1.78$! Until then you wait, and pay that in fees :p

I think once the smoke clears we'll be back at 12-13k$. Or that's what I hope at least.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:26:47
You'll get burnt to a crisp my friend. I too have significant holdings at 4300 levels. I'm HODLing out the storm. Also will buy some when it starts picking up momentum.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:56:28
I'm fairly new so please don't ridicule if I'm asking a stupid question?
Is it not possible for us to buy from the chinese exchanges if they're priced fairly low? Isn't an arbitrage possible?
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:26:27
Here, take an upvote for that analogy.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:30:59
Looks like it may break 2877 too. 2950 as I write this.

We're all sinners in some way aren't we? You and I have committed the same sin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:11:30
That's how you get toasted to a crisp. What if you sell and people think to themselves, "oh, let's buy now". 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:07:47
I agree
HODLing is probably our best bet.
Also buying low to average out our costs.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:40:52
Stop this FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:22:44
But wouldn't the value of bitcoin will erode proportionately? Like in the case of bonus equity stocks?
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:11:54
I do know that xD 
My worry (despite btc's track record of bouncing back ridiculously) is that it may be stuck at lower levels for a long time. Nonetheless i think there's nothing much we can do but speculate at this point.

@_date: 2017-09-29 11:08:32
You forgot the golden rule. When in doubt, HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:46:39
I can too, India. You can live a year on 4k or even in such a way 40k wouldn't suffice.

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:12:37
Oh boy! That's precisely how you get burnt to a crisp. I've done this. I lost almost 0.1 btc that day. I vowed never to do that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:38
It's been literally 4 weeks, assuming about the other 48 based on these 4 isn't a smart assumption.

Magic 8 ball at work?
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:49:55
Won't be too sure! Panic sellers might show up anytime! Also the whales might wake up! Holding is good. Buying if your average cost is above current market cost levels.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:06:49
Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:55:48
Being able to set aside 4K for an investment that may or may not yield desirable results is financial freedom to some of us.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:38:58
Yeah! Also the down trend doesn't seem to stop
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:11:51
Feels good to know I'm not alone! 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:08:30
Love your name! If you're asking seriously, the math is solid, what's ambiguous is what really matters, everything other than the math.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:24:05
I had written this just a few minutes ago when a certain someone wanted to buy 250$ a month. Seeing as you're considering the same SIP strategy, this might be useful.
I'm no expert when it comes to bitcoins. I'm new here. But let me explain the math behind your idea.
You plan on investing say 60$ a week for say 3 years. 
Let's now assume an extremely modest growth rate of 2% per week compounded week on week. Going by btc's track record, let me remind you this is a very modest estimate. Especially now that it's way more popular, you can expect it to grow faster. Applying the said rate on the current price of 1 btc, we reach a cool 90k in 3 years. Yes it sounds like something that'll never happen. If you'd told some guy buying btc @ 1$ back in 2010 that it'll be 5000 times it's value in 7 years, he'd think you're pulling out numbers using your magic 8 ball.
So maybe, just maybe 90k in if not 3, maybe 5 years is possible.
Coming to the problem at hand, if you invest 250$ a month( you'd be better off investing 60$ a week when transaction costs get feasible) , in 3 years you'll have reached a nice 0.7038 btc ,which is well - less?
Another way to look at it is that you're investing 8600$ over the course of 3 years  (60 x 52 x 3)' Present value adjusting an inflation rate of say 5.2% p.a. 
And 8600, not all at once. So even if the critics are right and btc fails, you'll still burn your fingers as you'd have invested more than what you would, if you'd invest 3000 (4150$ x 0.7038) now and sit back and watch the show.
Or maybe all of this is bullshit and you should do what you think is correct :) All the best.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:46:08
Contrary, i think there's an inverse relationship so to say. Dollar depreciates, btc goes up. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:54:34
No bobs only mobs here (moobs).
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:14:04
Noob question : Is there a free wallet like electrum? I have very less btc to be investing in a wallet.
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:10:47
Goa is now too commercialised to enjoy! I'd recommend Gokarna and Hampi!
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:17:04
Simple logic, if you think the price will rally up further, buy 1 @ 4200 and sell at whatever you think it'll rally upto. Back it back when it comes down.
If you think this rally is going to correct itself, basically reach 4000 or below, you wait and buy later?
Really comes down to how you're feeling! Bullish or bearish?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:35:04
Bhai wo toh doobega. * Bro, he's gonna get burnt* because somethings can be expressed best in your own tongue. 
Also finance costs alone will kill him while he waits for the rates to go up!
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:13:31
Slightly off topic but can you explain what's going to happen to the btc (0.3) i bought this month when the next fork comes into play?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:36:38
Also, I took the segwit issue into consideration too. What i thought was why shouldn't i ride the wave until then, if it falls I'll sell it off for a small profit or even a small loss and buy it back when it dips. Why let the rally go waste?
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:44:11
Give it a day or two, people may be consolidating to aim higher.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:07:55
That's sad! I've already put in everything I could. Now I'm sitting back and watching the show! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:22:15
Can't! I'm planning to move it to electrum, hold there. These cunts can't be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:08:10
Counter strike influence?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:22:19
Highly unlikely unless whales go crazy?
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:09:31
Yes but it does scare the shit out of you for a second?

@_date: 2017-10-06 06:48:43
Because I'm a noob! I didn't know it was free, thanks man :) so it's safer to keep it in electrum than Zebpay? Zebpay is from where I bought btc!

Liquidate, pay off your mortgage and start investing your airbnb income into crypto. That's what I'd do. At the risk of sounding stupid, you may lose some serious return from your existing cryptos when liquidated, but you'll gain that in health avoiding all the mortgage stress.
