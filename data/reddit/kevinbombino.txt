Also many of these could be corporate accounts at exchanges.  As an example, merchant processors like BitPay have to be constantly selling Bitcoin for fiat.  Coinbase before it had GDAX, had to buy on exchanges.  Etc.

Our Chinese suppliers essentially pass through the PayPal fees to us (2.9%), but I am honestly happy to pay it because I want the ability to file a chargeback, should I need to.
So not only do I need to convince them to accept Bitcoin, I would also have to convince them to use an escrow service that gets me the equivalent security I get now in terms of being able to reverse a payment.
With all of that said, it seems like this should still be doable for less than 2.9%.

Don't think of the internet as shutting down, but think in terms of a network split.  Some amount of machines going down or becoming disconnected from each other is equivalent in this situation.
The network will split into smaller networks, and whichever network has more hashing power connected to it will create the most blocks, thus becoming the chain most likely to be recognized as the main chain when the network is rejoined.
In your apocalypse scenario, you'll just have to travel to wherever you have to travel to to be able to connect to that part of the network in order to spend your coins.

From my understanding this does not affect Kraken because Kraken intentionally does not offer the type of peer to peer lending products that Bitfinex was offering that got them into trouble with the CFTC in the first place.  Kraken uses cold storage.

In either a soft or hard fork, miners may need to upgrade.  The difference between them is about what happens to the rest of the full nodes.
A hardfork means those blocks will cause old fullnodes (that don't mine) to think they are not on the valid latest chain and thus be fully broken.
A softfork means that old fullnodes (that don't mine) will continue to see the correct valid chain (implementing the new rules) as the correct valid chain and continue to work, though without some of the additional validation provided by the new rules (though that validation will be getting performed elsewhere on the network, just not your node).

Honestly, I'm not sure where all this outrage comes from.  Bitcoin has a market value of over $8 billion dollars.  The developers, the foundation, and even Satoshi himself want us to use, promote, invest in, and grow Bitcoin.
Many of us have invested thousands, millions, or even tens of millions of dollars into Bitcoin, and whether Satoshi likes it or not, we as investors deserve to understand the asset that we're investing in.  
Furthermore, we as investors deserve to understand what is likely to come of Satoshi's BTC holdings.  Does he plan to sell them?  When?  This article certainly doesn't answer that, but it gives us a place from which to begin formulating our viewpoints.
Personally I think that it will be a great benefit to Bitcoin as a whole to have Satoshi's identity known publicly.  It never made sense to me that bitcoin was simultaneously open source and also shrouded in secrecy.  Not knowing the identity of Satoshi has scared off many many backers and investors over the years who now have no reason to be scared.

Segwit blocks are valid to nodes not aware of segwit.  That's why it's called a "soft fork".

That would not happen if they just simply didn't upgrade their node.

Mad props to Jonas Schnelli for his hard work, but you can tell that this was written by engineers.  I would love to go through Core and work on improving the readability of text, especially thinking about people with lower education levels.  I might suggest something like the following:
    The wallet only shows transactions and balances from downloaded blocks.
    The block download is running and progress is shown below. *Balances shown will not be correct until all blocks are downloaded.*
    If you send bitcoins before all blocks are downloaded, you must ensure that the balances shown aren't impacted by a later block.

Ultimately, it sets up whatever device you're running LastPass on as a single point of failure.  If that device gets compromised, and you open your LastPass vault on that device, you're pwned.

Well, in general, I try to set up second factor or even more than that factor authentication for any account of high value that I use with LastPass.  For example, I have it configured with Bank of America that I need to use 2FA to send a wire transfer.  
You can't do that with recovery words for a bitcoin HD wallet, so that's why I would change my operating procedure for that.
I do think it's risky to not have 2FA enabled on any financial account.

The receiver will see exactly what they expect to see.  The type of transaction is determined by the address that they give you.

Bad idea. The key is we want to capitalize on the psychological associations that are created when the "new money" (bitcoin) has rough value parity to the existing money (in per-unit terms).  Being off by a factor of 1000 in either direction doesn't help.

GBTC has low liquidity due to the fact that new shares can only be issued to accredited investors, who then must hodl them for at least one year before they are allowed to sell.  This requirement was put in place so as to enable them to trade under existing regulations.
The Winklevoss ETF seeks to launch as a full ETF that would not have this restriction, so it should have a lot more liquidity and therefore more exactly track the bitcoin price (if it can get approved by the SEC).

In order for the transactions to impact the mempool in a wide way, these transactions would need to be widely broadcast, which means they would be available for any miner to include in a block.  
If you only broadcast the transactions such that a single miner could see them, it would not affect the fee market because they would not be visible in the mempool to most nodes.
Also, the miner would have an opportunity cost of participating in this attack, namely, the value of the other paying transactions he could be including in the block.

GBTC has a bizarre structure that allows it to issue new shares only to accredited investors and then those newly issued shares cannot change hands for a full year (called a "lockup period").  So if the price of bitcoin is rising, GBTC can be expected to be priced at a premium.
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:05:12
You are conflating two things.
There's the actual investments you were invested in (probably some funds, etc), and there's the tax-protected vehicle (the 401k).  Don't throw out the baby with the bath water.  What you want is to combine both-- buy bitcoin INSIDE a tax-protected vehicle.
If you don't, you'll find yourself owing a lot of taxes on those bitcoin when you go to sell them in 26 years.

It's not just the 10% penalty on early withdrawals, you also have to pay tax on the withdrawn funds, which depending on your tax bracket and length of holding could be up to 39.6%.  Let's assume it's a long term capital gain, those are currently taxed at 23.8%, so with the penalty, you've got 34.8% of your money going to the government guaranteed vs being in GBTC where the premium *might* evaporate before you can move your investment to COIN.  I'll stick with the latter.
@_date: 2016-12-25 14:54:10
Taking money out of a tax-protected vehicle to buy bitcoin is a bad idea!  You have 60 days to roll those funds into a new retirement account to make it a tax free conversion.  Open up a Roth IRA at Vanguard and buy and hold GBTC (and you can switch to the new COIN ETF once it launches) rather than holding raw bitcoin.  Otherwise, you'll be taxed every time you sell.

Basically, ASICBOOST allows re-use of one of the inputs to the hash.  So you don't generate more hashes, but you do get to skip a good portion of the steps in generating that hash, which is the power savings.

No, it would not.  You are misunderstanding how ASICBOOST works.  Turning the feature off would not decrease their hash rate, but it would dramatically increase their power bill, causing the long term equivalent of a hash rate reduction, but it would not be immediate.

That would be true if we were talking about a generalized CPU, but an ASIC has actual physical implementations for each stage of the process.  So this depends on exactly how ASICBOOST is implemented in hardware.  From what it sounds like, the chip has the capability to run that step every time, but it just turns it off when ASICBOOST is in use, to achieve the power reduction.

China has currency controls.  It's hard to get Yuan out of China.

This also adds a new explanation for statements by other large mining farms who have previously said something to the effect of "In order to preserve our access to buying mining equipment from Bitmain, we need to be against Segwit."

This idea has been discussed, however, it turns out that it actually is harmful for a miner to mine a bunch of transactions that no other miner knows about, because it means it will take longer for them to transmit the block.

Assuming you are in the United States...
Yes, the income is taxable for the date you received it at the value of the bitcoins at that day.
So if you received 3 bitcoins and a BTC was worth $500 on that day, that's $1500 of income.  
If you later sell the bitcoins for more than $1500, say you sell them for $2000, then that will be an additional $500 of either long-term or short-term capital gains depending on how long you held the coins.  This will result in more tax at that time.  If you sell them for less than $1500, that's a capital loss, which can offset other capital gains on your taxes.

It's not that easy.  Forks don't have to be hard forks to be malicious.  There can be equally malicious soft forks.  How would you handle soft forks, such as the Segwit upgrade?  Not supporting segwit would put the fund at a considerable disadvantage at this current point in time.

GBTC has restrictions on how new shares can be traded 1 year after issuance which results in it diverging wildly from the price of the underlying bitcoin.
COIN is a full ETF where you can take delivery of the underlying asset so it in theory should very closely track the actual bitcoin price, making it much more usable as a tool to invest in Bitcoin by proxy.

If they are just false signaling without actually running the btc1 client, will anything actually lock in?

but all joking aside, it actually IS a good use case, comparable to the silk road use case with bitcoin.  Something has to drive in the initial capital.

(his company)
When I reached out to Genesis and asked to buy the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), they told me that it's no longer available and pitched the Ethereum Classic Investment Trust instead.

So... you sold them to someone else?  Who will presumably ... mine with them?

For the future, for buys of $25k or greater, it's best to use Genesis Trading.

A shit ton.  Most likely well into the single-digit billions.

Just playing devil's advocate here.  In the 2008 crash, the first thing that happened to me was that banks slashed all my lines of credit.  They had to-- they didn't have the money to lend.  I think people believe that in a major upheaval event, those lines of credit you think you have might not be as available as you realize.

Alan wrote a few paragraphs about this on the first post of the Armory thread on bitcointalk:

Another gem:
"The fact that Ethereum did a hard fork to recover funds from an attack sets a precedent for all digital currencies, not just one chain."

This feature is very much on Armory's radar screen as a way to increase ease of use and drive further adoption.  While I have no idea where Alan sees it on the exact timeline, I wouldn't be surprised to have this sooner than you might expect.

They really do need to come up with a priority support queue for larger customers though.  I have done well over $100,000 in transactions with Coinbase and I haven't gotten any response at all to my ticket since Wednesday.  It's insane.
And my issue is that they appear to have erroneously debited my account in the amount of 50 BTC.  Not 0.1, not 0.2, but 50.  If anyone from Coinbase sees this-- it's case

The new version is out in Beta ...  ... should be a final release soon!

There's a security/privacy issue with Electrum vs Armory-- you are sending the Electrum server a list of all your public addresses, thus a compromised (or monitored, or MITM'd) Electrum server would reveal the list of addresses in your wallet.  
Furthermore, a compromised Electrum server could also return to you incorrect information about your wallet.
With Armory, you use your local trusted blockchain copy, so there isn't this disadvantage.

You mean Coinlab, not Coindesk, I think.  But yes, I agree with your concern.
The only thing that would convince me otherwise would be for Gox to release a statement from an auditing firm vouching for their solvency.
