I always said that the effect of approval of ETF on bitcoin price was highly exaggerated. This created an unnecessary expectation and became a reason for manipulation in the market. After it backfired, manipulators are now saying ETF is just one part of BTC. What a joke!

I believe that's what you are asking.
You need to use "compare" function.

No it's not. I've always said that the effect of approval of ETF on bitcoin price has been highly exaggerated. This created an unnecessary expectation and became a reason for manipulation in the market. After it backfired, manipulators are now saying ETF is just one part of Bitcoin. What a joke!

Since, they stopped usd/try trading through banks. Best way for Turkish people to protect themselves from Turkish lira's devaluation unfortunately tether is the best solution. But in terms of bitcoin no. because it's much more manipulated than Turkish Lira.

ETF is the opposite of decentralization. Unfortunately it's going to be approved.  
Unfortunately, richest 1% own half the world's wealth. We didn't think we could change the financial system without their say so, did we?

The world is waiting for the big companies especially in US to start using Bitcoin. There was no middleman big enough to manage payment processing with cryptocurrencies. Everyone expected Starbucks to start using bitcoin, because they have the biggest store chain in the world. If they start using bitcoin, this might pave the way for other companies, but they didn't want to go for it because of many reasons. It's very crucial to be quick in technological developments if you want to succeed. Some companies lost faith in blockchain technology but Starbucks saw the future. They are taking a huge but a calculated risk in partnering with ICE. It seems ICE is going to pull this off and Starbucks will be rewarded in the process.
