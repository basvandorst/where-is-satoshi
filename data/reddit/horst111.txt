It's a business. A scam or not, Genesis is almost always sold out, so people do buy

Someone pointed me to this and I finally managed to make the purchase.
But, should every client of every shop accepting bitcoin trough Bitpay follow their twitter, read their blog, website, subscribe to their email notifications to be able to transact?
What if you would have an online shop accepting Bitpay, do you think your clients would know how to pay, how many do you think would pass on buying your products because of this very complicated payment method? Not to mention that for the average Joe, bitcoin is very complicated itself, add Bitpay and you twisted his mind.

I feel like this is made to stop the mass adoption. I don't care about their technical issues, this my opinion as a client, work harder and make it better, other wallets managed to make it a lot easier.

I'm using ledger, blockchain, electrum, etc. I do have experience in using bitcoin since 2013-2014.

I always hated Bitpay, Jihan and Roger Ver owns it
