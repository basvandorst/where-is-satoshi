If you took the time to understand what you're talking about. You would know the only difference between Bitcoin testnet and mainnet is a single line of code in your config file.
Any of these nodes/wallets can be used on mainnet in a beta/use at your own risk, just remove the testnet=1 from your config files.

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:22:30
There are lots of nodes that are not discoverable. You have to announce the IP and port you want peers to connect to you on, this is the last part of the URI you see in blockstreams link: 
02f6725f9c1c40333b67faea92fd211c183050f28df32cac3f9d69685fe9665432 
They actually forgot the port in this post, but they tweeted me it's the default 9735 
If you don't announce your IP, your node still works partially as in you can open channels and send/receive funds in said channel, but no one will be able to connect/relay through you.

@_date: 2018-01-14 16:41:36
Well let me clarify something for you. The only difference between the two(testnet, mainnet) for this purpose is  a single line in the conf file.
People are testing their nodes on testnet right now because there is a lot of security/networking/configuring that goes in to running your node.
There are actually LN transactions happening on mainnet now, so only a matter of time before all these nodes on testnet start changing that line in the conf file to main.

A noob setting up a trezor vs ledger I can see your argument for security, but to me the trezor is very clunky and I'm quite confident in my security practice.
But over all that is a misconception on ledger security, it depends how the device was setup, and what method you're using. My 2 of 3 hw nano is 100% secure and stores my deep cold storage. 
For someone to steal my stash they would need to find 2 of 3 of my hardware wallets, figure out my password, figure out my pin, figure out the pin of my phone to verify the transaction. It's just not going to happen.
If I had my cold storage on my trezor they would just need possession of the 1 trezor and my pin. (I don't think trezor supports multi sig yet, but I could be wrong it's been a while since I messed with their gear).
So really the trezor is less secure for my purposes. But I think I'm in the minority of such practices as it may be overkill.

You have some good points, but not 100% accurate. There are many who feel a correction is over due for US markets. We have been ranging at the top for 5 months with no break outs because there is no money left to invest. The markets were pumped with free 0% money, the growth has been artificial.
Unemployment isn't a good statistic to source because of how it is reported. Once you no longer receive unemployment benefits you're technically of that list. Whether you found employment it not.
Once the Fed actually starts raising rates we'll know if qe was successful or not. But debt/consumer debt has never been higher, so once you pull out that institutional 0% qe money from markets, we're going to pull out a lot of liquidity that cannot be replaced.

Well, I would of suggested reframing from using all caps, repeating the same thing over and over, and send other forms of documentation. advising them to specifically address the reason your documents are not being verified if turned down yet again.
What type of documentation are you attempting to send them for your verification that is getting denied? Is it truly something you received in the mail from the post office? If it is an online bill they know because it won't be pixalated like a scanned image.

Here you go fellow redditor!
It’s been nearly three years since anyone involved with Bitcoin heard from Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of the cryptocurrency that has created fortunes and changed lives. Now it seems that Nakamoto has finally been revealed. And many in the Bitcoin community would rather that the godfather of digital money had remained a cipher.
On Thursday morning, Newsweek published its exposé on Nakamoto, a two-month investigation that led to Nakamoto’s home near San Bernadino, California. Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, if indeed he is Bitcoin’s creator as plenty of evidence indicates, is a 64-year-old Japanese-American man with libertarian leanings, a background in classified military engineering, and a love of model trains. There’s little sign that he’s spent the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital cash that he likely controls based on analyses of Bitcoin’s transaction history; He lives in a modest home and drives a Toyota Corolla.
But for many in the Bitcoin community, even those who have been obsessed with Nakamoto for years, those details may not have been worth violating the privacy of a very private person. “If someone was telling you they don’t want to be known, and you report a story about that person’s life and put up a picture of him and his home, that’s a bit f–ked up,” says Michael Goldstein, creator of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, a website that catalogs Nakamoto’s writings along with other Bitcoin-related papers. He still doubts the article’s findings, but argues that it’s shamefully invasive of Nakamoto’s solitude if it is true. ”I find it upsetting.”
On Bitcoin Talk, the main web forum that hosts the cryptocurrency community’s conversation, reactions began with denial. “What is this fake crap,” wrote one of the first commenters. “Unless he can do a signed transaction from an address known to be that of the originator of Bitcoin, then I don’t believe, sorry,” wrote another user, referring to a cryptographic trick that would prove someone held the private Bitcoin keys known to be held by Nakamoto.
Soon, the conversation shifted to anger. “Way to reward our liberator. Irresponsible,” wrote Amir Taaki, a well-known Bitcoin developer. “Really immature journalism at best. A mistake that might cost someone their life at worst,” added another commenter.
Criticism of Newsweek’s article, which describes a silent standoff as reporter Leah McGrath Goodman’s stood at the end of Nakamoto’s driveway and was questioned by police, focused in particular on Goodman’s decision to name Nakamoto’s family members and to publish a picture of his house. Mikko Hypponen, a security researcher for antivirus firm F-Secure, showed that he was quickly able to determine the address of the house and posted a picture of it from Google Maps Streetview. “This is so bad for Mr. Nakamoto,” he wrote on Twitter. “It’s trivial to find his home address on the net.”
Gavin Andresen, chief scientist for the Bitcoin foundation, wrote that after reading Newsweek’s piece he wished he hadn’t allowed himself to be interviewed for the article. “I’m disappointed Newsweek decided to dox the Nakamoto family,” he wrote on Twitter, using the Internet jargon “dox” to refer to revealing identifying details on someone, “and regret talking to Leah.”
On Reddit’s subforum devoted to Bitcoin, however, a user with a throw-away account responded to the article by posting a note of gratitude to Nakamoto: ”Just want to take this chance to thank him for what he has done,” wrote ThankYouSatoshi, Calling the revelation of more details of his life’s work “a true inspiration to me.”
If nothing else, Nakamoto’s unmasking does start to answer questions about the political motivations behind Bitcoin. Newsweek’s story quotes Nakamoto’s daughter describing him as a libertarian who is “very wary of the government, taxes and people in charge.” In another part of the story, she describes playing a game with her father in which they would pretend “government agencies” were coming after her, and she would hide in the closet.
“It sounds like he was a libertarian and had a huge distrust of the government,” says the Nakamoto Institute’s Goldstein, an anarcho-capitalist himself, and one who has argued for years that the politicial intentions of Bitcoin’s creator had been to limit government control of money. He sees that revelation of Nakamoto’s similar outlook as validation. “Told you so.”
But Goldstein argues that Nakamoto’s personal life and political opinions have little to do with Bitcoin’s current functioning. Bitcoin’s code, after all, has been almost entirely rewritten since Nakamoto published the first implementation of it.
In fact, Goldstein says he wishes that the namesake of his Institute had remained in obscurity, leaving the world to focus on the code, rather than the person who wrote it. “It’s less mythological this way,” Goldstein says. “I’ve always wanted to know about Satoshi only because it tells us about Bitcoin itself…when the person is known, it makes it more difficult to explain why it doesn’t matter who the

I would love to see Google incorporate bitcoin into their Google shop/shopping cart. 
Also, if they would have an option to be paid ad revenue in Bitcoin that would be spectacular. I could see a really nice model being modeled after Bitpay. Where a user would be able to choose how they recevied their payment. 100% Bitcoin, 80% Bitcoin 20% Currency of Choice, etc.
This could then trickle over to how they pay Youtubers in the same sense. They get paid per views, clicks, ad time watched, etc. If you could chose to be paid in Bitcoin I think that would be pretty huge. Especially sense that is heavily dependent on micro transactions.

lol MT.Gox Story goes something like this:
"loses" 800k BTC (cough fell in their pockets cough)
"finds" 200k BTC, ok, we "found" 1/4 of the "lost" coins, we'll give them back to you and keep the other 3/4 and everyone is happy and Gox is behind us.

short, sweet, to the point, and dead on.
All of us wish for peoples coins to be returned. But no one has any clue how deep this corruption was within Mt.Gox. They have been on damage control for quite some time now.
You may even have officials in Japan who have been working along side Gox funneling money away from eager hands. This would not be the first time such things have happened. Japan has a very colorful financial history.

get a laminator, and a fucking fire safe my friend.
Then back up the private key on a couple of flash drives, put one in your safe, and one in a safety deposit box.
Then also take that backup encrypted private key and store a copy on your phone, and your computer.
There, now you never have to worry about human error ever again.

In regards to the "BETTER" way of using blockchain, I pose a question(I'm not entirely sure if this is even possible, but doesn't hurt to ask).
By running an extension are you not opening up yourself to maleware piggy-backing off installed said extension? That being, once Blockchain extension is initiated, this maleware would then be triggered to key-log, or install sniffing cookies in to the browser in use?
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:16:21

that is such a giant head and shoulders pattern.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:28:29
I completely disagree.
I work with BT technology A LOT, and it is just as much of a hassle to enable Bluetooth as it is to take out your phone and hit a button for an app.
Not to mention you have to setup the pairing. Which if you have a lot of devices around, there is a lot of opportunity to make a mistake and pair with the wrong device. Which given this situation someone could set out a phishing device for this very purpose, to have people pair with the device and install malicious software or simply steal private information.
Sure once you've gone through the setup once it would not be an issue. But you still have to go through some sort of pairing, unlike what you said in your original post.
In conclusion, there needs to be human interaction on your transactions because security. I don't want my phone trying to be intuitive and save me 3 seconds of my life by not making me take my phone out and then I lose several thousand dollars with no hope of having it returned.

So true.. They're going to offer some sort of license one must acquire in order to do business with Bitcoin, this license will assure that you must go through certain hoops, which will in turn "weed out the illegal activity."
When in all reality, they're the crooks.

Isn't sweeping a better practice?

If time was no issue you're correct, but they would not have enough time to raise their fee, raise capital, order equipment, implement equipment, and get their hashing power up to compete with the 95% 
Also, they may not have the ability to get the equipment needed, large chip manufacturers would just hold their chips and mine, rather than selling them for obvious reasons. The only reasons mining equipment is being sold right now is to fund R&amp;D. It is far more profitable to mine then it is to sell mining equipment with how the reward structure is. (if you're a huge chip producer BFL KNC Avalon etc)
I'm far less concerned of a 51% attack as I am of the Bitcoin infrastructure becoming too centralized.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:25:58
you obviously didn't do your shopping last year with BTC, because it was just as easy. And we had way more purchasing power :D

This sounds like bullshit to me.
* 1) Someone was just selling an HD at a rummage yard sale without clearing it first? 
 
* 2) you have the address to ship it back already, you were at their house/business for the rummage sale.
* 3) if you really did have to get in contact with the person, you could of just emailed the person the .dat file. 
* 4) there would of been a client on there most likely with the wallet already loaded

Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

Just curious, do you have a bunch of people getting these, or just the same person over and over? :P
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:09:10
yeah I don't get why they didn't release it online with a donation button the same night it premired at Tribeca. Tribeca could quadruple their proceeds by selling online passes to showings.
@_date: 2014-01-29 14:28:24
the thing is, we already have regulation, we don't need more; moreover, as said yesterday, the current system is working. Bad people are getting caught, good people are able to use the currency.
What we need is them to give us is a green light that Bitcoin can flourish and operate. Not this dark cloud over our head that we might be doing something illegal in a year or two.

Dude you're wrong just stop. There are instant transfers through services like bitpay and the new bip70_73 encrypted wallets. It is redundant to wait for 6 confirmations using this technology.

Thank you Andreas, you continue to be a man of integrity, and I for one love having you apart of this great community.
This may be a blessing in disguise, because of your actions this community is on track to turn an awful situation perpetrated by an unethical reporter/organization in to something good. Putting the power in the peoples hands, rather than waiting for (and most likely never happening) Newsweek fixing the almost irreparable mess they've made for this family.
Great job organizing this, and kudos to this community. 15.6BTC(almost $10,000 USD) donations at the time of this post only 2 hours after Andreas had made this public. Simply Amazing.
Long live Bitcoin.

Well all these companies(dell, dish, overstock to name a few)  are starting to accept Bitcoin and are focused on USA consumers. People that already have shopped with these companies.
Also, a Country that is already fortunate enough to have the ability to shop anywhere globally because the USD is the Global Reserve Currency.
There really isn't a whole lot of incentive right now for main stream US based consumers to take the time to learn bitcoin, they don't see a value added proposition.
These merchants need to give incentives, newegg has 10% which is great! More merchants need to do similar things to make consumers change their habits.

This is not true, they only reason btc can continue to grow right now with hoarders is because of block discovery.
Once all the bitcoins have been mined, if no one is spending btc's why would miners continue to mine? They wouldn't, their only incentive at that point would be through transaction fee's, which they would not be receiving.
You should save, but you should also spend. If no one spent any Bitcoin, it would be worthless. Just like if no one used credit cards, they would be worthless.
Moreover, if no one spent anything in any economy it doesn't matter where you're talking about, that economy would crumble.

Wow so much failed reading comprehension, and overall lack of reading the full document by many posters here.
They have to keep records of inactive accounts for five years, after that it is a non issue. They don't have to send anything unless it is asked for.
I think this guidance is great, it is setup with the customer in mind. Holding bonds/usd to back all bitcoin on file at all times, rigorous staff checks to keep shady people out, strict security audits. It doesn't get any better then this.
Not to mention there was a huge lack of overreach which surprised me in a good way. The only ones who need this license are those operating a type of exchange.
This is going to lead to the first usa based exchanges that are transparent and actually responsible for customers deposits. No more stolen funds or incompetent individuals losing keys, or fleeing the country with depositers hard earned bitcoin

Get out of Chase while you still can. 
Your best options:
* Go talk with the manager at a reputable local bank, tell them exactly what you're doing, what Bitcoin is, and answer any questions they have
* Go speak with the nearest credit union and do the same as above
You should stay away from large international banks, Bitcoin is their largest threat, of course they're going to close accounts of Bitcoin users.
Also make sure while you're looking that they have online access an app if you're in to that kind of thing, and just basic technology you have become accustomed to using Chase.

savers/investors are another name for a type of Bitcoin Consumer.
Bitcoin Consumer = anyone who trades Fiat for Bitcoin, and then uses it for whatever they perceive is the confirmed benefit. In your instance of savers/investors; Bitcoin is a storage of wealth that they believe will increase in time. No different than lets say, a gold consumer.
China last year was buying up Bitcoin like crack because it was the easiest way they have ever had to get their hands on USD/a currency that is not artificially manipulated by their Government. Moreover, there are limits to how much Yaun they're allowed to convert/year. There are many other reasons, such as opening up trade channels to the common-man that allowed them access to potential buyers from around the world rather than just in their little market.
You can't generalize consumers as, people who use Bitcoin to buy shoes, or computers, it is much more than that. Everyone who purchases Bitcoin is a "consumer". The issue is you don't have people buying Bitcoin right now, other than those who are already invested/aware.

Bitcoin is different than other cryptos because of it's computational power backing it. This is a billion times larger than any other coin currently on the market, or any coin that tries to join the market.
To get all that power to switch to a different coin would be impossible unless it was built on the same architecture, which if that is the case, that coin would offer nothing that Bitcoin doesn't or couldn't already.

How would using your PayPal account be any different than your back account? Your back account is setup with your PayPal no?
The least intrusive way to buy bitcoin however is using localbitcoins, and meeting up with someone in person. It is also the least convenient.

Adding a tiny blue link that says pay with bitcoin takes away from your overall donations? Whhhhaaat? I don't see the connection. If you didn't have a red arrow to point out where the link was on the main donation page it would take someone a while to even find it.

You're missing the point.
It's not a PC sitting connected to the internet with a browser open, downloading exe files, java certificates, initiating SSL, etc etc.
It is safe, this wallet was/is safe, the funds are safe. We can play what if's for eternity, and the wallet will still be safe.
Bitcoin done properly, is safe, much safer then any other alternative out there.

* Approved applications will ultimately be required to adhere to the proposed regulatory framework NYDFS puts forward for virtual currency firms operating in New York.
*  NYDFS is also providing notice today that it intends to propose that regulatory framework no later than the end of the second quarter of 2014.
So to get a license you have to agree to rules/laws that have not yet been made? And *might* be ready at the end of Q2.
Sounds risky yet, I think it will be bigger news when an exchange actually opens in NY. But good news indeed :D

If I may make a suggestion though.

they don't set fees, but they can choose not to accept transactions unless they have a certain amount of fee attached to it.
If three super large mining operations are responsible for 95% of the network hash, other miners would not be able to handle the transaction load. This will become an even larger problem as the amount of transactions grow.
This is my worry.

no need to apologize, you came to a place centered around bitcoin to ask a bitcoin related question.
Just keep in mind if you do end up looking at purchasing bitcoin, you do not need to buy them whole, you can buy .1 .01 .001..... Bitcoin is dividable down to the millionth of a whole (.000001)
That is the common rookie mistake, people look at the price tag of a whole coin now like :O I can't afford that. Best thing you can do is figure out how much you could afford weekly and start amassing bitcoin that way.

The nice thing about a free market is, if you don't like it don't use it.
There are other options to Robocoin, and their data collection is not imposed on anyone other than those who chose to use their service. I think it is great for one, they're building the first ID verification required network in the states.  Which is eventually going to lead to a trusted network that even your grandma could get involved with. It will add security/insurance that Bitcoin currently does not have.
I for one, have not, and most likely will not use a Robocoin terminal, but that is because I am savvy enough to acquire coins by other means. For those who don't like meeting person to person, or sending their money to an exchange, Robocoin is a perfect alternative solution.

A majority of my coins are in bip38 cold storage in a safe at multiple locations, and digital backups. 
Multisig really wouldn't offer me any more protection. Seems like it is more for people who don't understand how to secure their coins. 
I think multisig is way more beneficial for wallets that share ownership rather than for individual use.
I respectfully disagree that paper wallets are cumbersome because they're not if you use them correctly. They can be physical and digital. You can sweep them at any time, and have way more security. Bip38 pw, pin to open wallet, password to send funds. That is 3 factor right there. And if I did it on a computer I would need to use google authenticator, so 4 factor security measure.

90% of do not understand markets.
Good news does not = price rise.
Massive CONSUMER adoption = price rise. And right now, for the last few months, Bitcoin consumer adoption has been stagnant, non-existent.
It's simple supply and demand. When we saw the last bubble what happened? Chinese craze of BTC, massive waves of new users joining BTC, price went up.
What do we have now? Massive USA Merchant adoption, only dealing within USA, with the same exact consumers they're already servicing. 
This will not drive consumer adoption, but it will provide for an adequate testing ground before they go global and have massive consumer adoption ;)

My concern is, you have to let it scan your QR code.
What QR code? does the user already have to have a wallet setup? 
If so, then the noobie is still at a loss for trying to get coins, they'll walk up to this thing it will ask for their code and they will have no idea what it is talking about.

I talk to people daily who have never heard what Bitcoin is, I don't think it is as widely known as you think. The only news covering it is finance channels like CNBC (which not many people watch) and it is only for 30 seconds - 1 minute mentions.
Or on some random local news channel (which I think has only happened 3 times) where they have no idea what they're talking about.
Or there will be some articles in the WSJ/USA Today/WP, but those same people who are taking the time to read that paper most likely already heard about it on CNBC.
So the next big boom will not be until the general masses have seen it implemented mainstream(apple, amazon, google, etc) and it is easy to get. As in, they go to a website, enter in their info and boom, you have bitcoin. None of this waiting days/weeks to get verified, then buy bitcoin, and wait another few days/week for your coin to show up.
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:06:52

I would agree with you if they were trying to re-brand POS.
But their POS system is called Coin of Sale it's an awesome play on words. 
Because it is Bitcoin (or any crypto coin) there is no "Point" of entry other than the exchange of Coin/Goods. That is how I intturpet it though, so I suppose it would be different person to person :)

I more mean that I was hesitant donating through this channel as I thought the whole thing could possibly be a scam. I couldn't conclude someone didn't rip off your trailer, make a copy youtube channel, and try to steal your donations.
There is no verified source for where the BTC address is coming from (aka verified twitter/reddit post coming from you as the creator).
And I don't have facebook to check any of that info out, and your reddit account is brand new. So still, I don't know if you're really the creator.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:44:23
but they don't need to do it all at once, there is no rush, they make their own rules. And they have plenty of time to work with currently.
So yes I agree with you, they can't shock the markets, which with slow selling you wont. Which is what they're most likely doing, what sane person would be selling right now on any of the other markets?
the only bad news is GOX, which really isn't that bad of news, and should not effect other markets. Which leads me to conclude the sells we're seeing are coins from GOX. 
If GOX was really trying to fix this issue, they would of suspended all trading the moment of the announcement of spending malleability.

Do you have shitty/sub par credit? Just curious. Myself and several people I know had no issue getting an account and buying within 5 minutes, we're all in the 750+ range. 
I then know people with 600 and under credit, and they were not able to buy and had to jump through all the hoops you describe.
I would conclude they're using soft credit checks to validate customers and fraudsters.

no one can instill confidence in to you without you first understanding Bitcoin and the true power of it. Once one fully understands the empowering features  behind Bitcoin, it is easy to see it's technology will not be going anywhere.
With that said, don't invest in anything just because you have heard a lot of people talking about it, it's a good way to get burned due to lack of reliable information (take Gox for a great example, people got herded there and butchered). Take the time to figure out why:
* you like Bitcoin,
* how is Bitcoin going to change your life, or the lives of people around the world, 
* and why you should invest in Bitcoin, 
To wrap it up, no one can tell you if it is a good time or not to buy. Many believe that it is, comparing Bitcoin's history to some current trends it is easy to draw the conclusion that we are ready to turn around to the up. But at the same time, with news from China and a lack of confidence in exchanges we could just as easily fall to a lower level than we are now. 
I have bought coins all the way down from 700, if we go to lower lows, I'll buy more, if we start going up, great. Don't invest more than you can lose, and never go all in or all out. Spread out buys, buying as the price drops. Than sell on the way up. Or, if you're a true believer, you just hold, because if everything does work out the way many of us think it will, you'll never need to sell ;)

Any sane person trying to make a return on investment would join said pool, because if a pool has 45 - 50% of the network, they're solving more, thus getting more of the rewards, thus you're making more Coin.
Now any sane person who cares about Bitcoin wouldn't, but sadly, most people have only gotten involved in Bitcoin to fatten their wallets, not because they care about Bitcoin.

A few things.
This guidance JUST came out yesterday, Coinbase hasn't even had time to respond to this news.
Second, it is still ILLEGAL under federal law. With how closely  Coinbase is watched by the Fed, I doubt they want to deal with any illegal business by the feds terms.
If a Bitcoin based exchange/pos company wanted to work with these dispensary they would need to have their headquarters located in the state with the dispensary.

No backups should be stored online. None, nothing, zip.
The only way to safely store backups are to print them, file them away, put them in safes, keep your brain wallet phrases memorized, buy a safe, put a copy in your safety deposit box, encrypt a file on your phone, flash drive, laminate printouts, buy a metal bitcard. 
There are tons of options, so don't be silly and lose your btc.

This is great, and I don't want my message to get lost here, **I feel incredibly bad for people that lost their funds**
No one forced you to put your coins/money there. People knew the risk, there was warnings for literally MONTHS. I can't tell you the amount of post on reddit/bitcointalk/blogs about not trusting Gox.
If people chose to ignore the warnings, that is their fault due to:
* lack of research/understanding of Bitcoin markets
* greed (gox price was inflated well above every other exchange **FOR A REASON YOU COULDN'T WITHDRAW FIAT FOR ALMOST A HALF YEAR; RED FLAG ANYONE?**
* lack of understanding Bitcoin's Protocol, you don't own the private keys, you don't own the coin.
With all this said, they haven't asked for anything yet other than peoples contact information. So I shall remain neutral on this organization until further information has been delved about them/their intentions. 
If Gox was returned, customers wealth partially returned, and faith restored with new management it could be quite the milestone for Bitcoin, it is impossible to argue that.
**tl;dr be careful, don't get your hopes up, maybe this is a blessing in disguise, somehow..**
@_date: 2014-07-21 01:52:19
Actually, a lot of people using Bitcoin right now just use it as a payment method. 
They buy the amount of coin they need and buy their product. Or buy product with Bitcoin, and replenish what BTC you just spent.

LIBOR's manipulation/cohesion was far worse than this, the markets didn't nosedive when it became public knowledge.
This cohesion forces people to perceive what they could not conceive. After matter being those highs are now attainable whereas before, you couldn't even conceive $1000/BTC.
I remember breaking $266 for the first time since last April before the Nov runup. It was just crazy and no one had any idea what to do now. Keep going up?! Well, OK!
The same thing will happen when we return to $1200/BTC once it is breached, what next? Is this where we stay? People are still buying? UP?
How high can this thing really go? It's a pretty wild ride 100% of the time, even when it's flat.. Why is it flat? what is happening? etc etc

Wrinkled shirt, not groomed, shirt not tucked in. That Man looks miserable from what we can see, like you(or whom ever took the picture) found a homeless man and told him to put on this shirt and tie, hold this board and let us take a picture for 5 bucks.

It sucks people jumped in so quickly before researching properly, but it's an unfortante biproduct of hype. Places people would find warnings included: bitcointalk.org, many traders in IRC Bitcoin related channels, and many predominate players in the Bitcoin development world.
The whole **point** of Bitcoin is that you don't need a 3rd party, you don't need some place to hold your funds, the USERS do this themselves. If that is not how you're managing your Bitcoins, than you're doing it wrong.
And please please **PLEASE** take precautions, get everything you own under your control, print keys, store in multiple places, shared send, generate new addresses often and backup. 
You don't just leave your car in your driveway with the keys in it; You don't leave your wallet on your porch when you go to bed; you don't leave your front door to your house open and a sign pointing up the stairs that reads "Daughters Room First Right." We guard everything we own and love, Bitcoin should be no different.
With all that said, it sucks that Mt.Gox was idolized so a lot of people jumping in on the train just flocked to them. But that is it people, greed.. Greed is the thing that made everyone quote the Mt.Gox price, Greed is the thing that convinced people to throw money away without doing proper research on exchanges/mining hardware /gambling sites, you name it. Greed is the thing that will hinder your better judgement until there is nothing but darkness left.

I like the colors you chose it gives you a lot to work with going forward, and the heading is appealing/attention getting. Also, the content you chose to include are on topic, and great introduction points.
But, I think there is too much text. No one is going to take the time to read that. If you would substitute some graphics you could cut a lot of text out.
Just start working down your paragraphs and figure out an image for each:
"Bitcoin is a digital currency, created and held electronically. No single institution controls Bitcoin, it is run by thousands of independent people around the world, and anybody can join"
So now you figure out how to make that in to a graphic. You need to portray people building a network, Monitors with Bitcoin's logo on them all, with light stroke lines connecting them, and The Fed with a big X through it on the outside? I dunno that is where the creativity/fun comes in :D
But then you just subtitle your graphics for the most part;
"Bitcoin is a global decentralized digital currency"
This way, your graphics do all the talking for you :)

I'm perfectly aware, and understand what you're saying.
But you're not taking in to account what you're saying.
You get more payouts on the larger pools, it may equate to the same, but you're getting paid more often which gives people the mentality they're making more/contributing more.
People want instant gratification, why do you think so many keep joining large pools. This same exact thing happened with BTCguild not long ago. Not to mention herd mentality starts playing in to the whole thing. 
So again I say, any sane bitcoin lover would not join said pools, but any person who does not understand bitcoin itself, and got in to mining because they figured they could "get rich quick" will follow the crowd and get their payouts at levels that seem impressive in frequency. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:05:05

Hey Jeff,
Friday Night, getting my spiced rum on, came across this post. Lets do it!!
So I got to thinking while I was waiting for my creative cloud to update my photoshop. How could we easily incorporate this in to what reddit already does, and keep it as intuitive as possible without looking tacky.
So I got to thinking of how would I display this "mode" of enabling a clump like post, or show similar post. After a while of thinking I thought back to math, there is already a symbol for this "~".
Ok awesome, most people should know this symbol (or I hope). so lets just stick that somewhere that everyone's cursor/eyes always go. Why not by the upvote/downvote buttons? Cool, lets do that, and copy what they already do... Until clicked it is Grey. Got it: 
Ok, now when this mode is activated lets make it let the user aware, boom, make it Orange.. Once this mode is activated underneath it will compile all the "similar" post, This can also be kept hierarchical within the clump view, the higher the rating the higher on the list the post will appear. You can still interact with all these post as you typically would. :

Another issue (which I have run in to myself) is trying to use said service (in your case Coinbase) to make a purchase, and their site is down, or you don't have an internet connection. You cannot transact.
So if you want to store a majority of your coin on Coinbase, that is probably fine, but your spending amount should be on a wallet that runs locally on your phone, so when their service is out, or you're data coverage sucks, you can actually use your coin.

Why would those consumers switch to bitcoin (unless they already own some) it's an inconvenience. Until these companies offer major incentive for those consumers they won't switch their ways, why would they?

Guys, it's been live since Monday, please read this carefully and understand it.
There are no sellers who want to sell their shares at current price. Therefore, there have been no trades.
What is complicated about this?

you don't have to spend btc to survive, I don't see the logic in this.

no, you're wrong. It's been live for a week already. But no qualified sellers have sold at the current bid prices.

They don't, that is the whole point of why they offer the service, to get suckers like OMG I CAN DOUBLE MY MONEY BY SIMPLY DEPOSITING HERE.
Then they hold your coins ransom until you lose it all gambling, the odds are on their side.
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:05:41
I think relying on old technology for an innovative technology is silly.
Using cards kind of defeats the whole purpose of what bitcoin is. What if your wallet gets stolen, the thief has access to your coins. You lose your card, you have to worry about someone finding it before you can take the steps to secure a new one. Your card is destroyed, etc etc etc.
People are very capable of using mobile technology, it's a fact there are more mobile devices in the world then there are people. They've got it figured out. Moreover, battery life is becoming less of an issue every day as the technology progresses.
A card is an acceptable form to have for the what if scenario, but it's not going to replace the mobile wallets plain and simple.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:25:35
Nothing. 
The only thing that can keep your bitcoin safe is you, that is the whole point of bitcoin, you don't need anyone to keep your wealth safe.

I wanted to contact Amazon to express a feature I think would be very beneficial to both Internal and External Customers, and that is of the use of Bitcoin.
Overstock and Tigerdirect have taken the leap, and allowed Bitcoin transactions, which as a consumer, is a very welcome change. Currently when I order something online on most sites, I need to input all of my personal information, along with Credit Card information. Essentially, all the information needed to steal my identity.
Target and Heartbleed has shown us, this data is not secure, and puts the customer in a very vulnerable situation.
Amazon has the opportunity to implement a more updated secure payment method that is also cheaper than traditional methods of Credit Cards. With the amount of volume Amazon does, I would assume the savings from Credit Card transactions would not be a figure to bite your thumb at.
In closing, does Amazon want to be the company it was back in the early Internet days and help path the way for innovation, or be the dud that does nothing and is left in the past such as the Zip Drive?

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:46:33
Yes, it saves them money on transactions, and the more people using bitcoin the more savings realized for them. Also, the this leads to less people they need to employee for their fraud department/chargeback department. Saving then even more money as time goes on.
These are just a few benefits, we could get in to a whole conversation of programmable money and how they could save even more money automating side of their supply chain and distributions network.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:56:43
nice, I should clarify though. I don't really think their prices are that outrageous if you're a professional trader and making your living from using their tools. 
I just know with my time I put in to charting now (very minimal) for me to pay that kind of money as a hobbyist doesn't make much sense. And that is why they have the free version :D
I'd totally throw them 50 bucks just to support them, as I have been using them a little over a year now and really love their site. So maybe they just need a Hobby sub that gives you access to something you miss out on the free version.

The cool thing with the printer is you can customize it any way you want! Do a test print to see where the wallet will print. Once you know the area you can design, or download some cool graphics (make sure it is going to compliment the black wallet information) and VOLLIA custom graphic BIP38 encrypted wallets at your finger tips :D
As for the F2F transactions, I always meet at a Star Bucks, or a Mall, some where with an outlet in a commons area. I bring the printer with me plug it in. When the buyer shows up we always get to chatting about Bitcoin for a while before we talk about the actual transaction we're there for.
The piper is 100% of the time an amazing conversation starter, and a good place for me to talk to people about security. Most of the time I just end up printing people 3 unique wallets each with a backup (with the switch turned to forget of course) and then I just load up the coin on to their smart phone. In a few instances the person could not use their phone (IOS issues) so the paper wallet was very handy.

IMHO; We could see a lot of buying on those exchanges. Only a fool would currently buy BTC on any exchange where you could not withdraw your BTC off of. Because as we all know if you don't control the keys, you don't control the coins.
Also, just look at the CNY local bitcoin volume, it has spike immensely since the BTC withdraw.

google translate ftw, read the whole thing in Chrome nbd.
The Central Bank of China issued a circular on March 27 requiring the closure of all accounts Bitcoin before April 15, and requiring banks and financial institutions not to provide services in connection with Bitcoin.
The central bank has asked banks to close before April 15 accounts available to the 15 largest online platforms to exchange Bitcoin to sever all ties between financial institutions and the fictional currency. Therefore, operators are forced to open their accounts abroad, their activities and becoming semi-clandestine.
If the central bank gave no further explanation of this approach, it follows a warning issued in December 2013 by five government bodies against the risks of Bitcoin.
According to the announcement of the Chinese institution, financial institutions no longer be able to develop operations Bitcoin Bitcoin set rates or provide intermediary services, insurance or any other service for Bitcoin transactions.
The central bank requires financial institutions to close all accounts Bitcoin, including those individuals. Until April 15, the existing accounts will remain open for withdrawals of funds, but will no longer be supplied. After this period, the owners of accounts that have not been closed will be fined and websites will stop providing financial services related to Bitcoin.

See, the problem for you, and many is that you live in a place where you have a nice cushy system in place that has been working for years. You have an infrastructure that is build and ready to take multiple forms of payment (credit card, check, cash, debit card etc).
You probably live in a Country where you don't have to worry about what website you order from because they don't take your currency, you probably live in a consumer market where you're flooded with choices.
Now put yourself outside one of these cushy areas, that don't have any kind of stable transaction POS system, Or their currency fluctuations weekly or daily, as much, or more-so than Bitcoin. In these areas your only option is what your community produces, or what your Government allows in or not.
Most people don't get it, they've never traveled outside of their "cushy" country and saw what mess a lot of places are. Trying to sell Bitcoins to Americans is laughable at best, they have the World Reserve Currency, you can buy anything anywhere, you know why? Because you have to convert your X currency in to USD to buy anything anywhere when dealing with International Trade.
So just because you don't get a lot of intimidate utility out of Bitcoin as a currency, doesn't mean that it isn't a huge utility to billions of people.
PS. you'll be happy to know Color Coin launches tomorrow, which will help build on exactly what you outline in your OP.

@_date: 2015-05-01 21:12:30
I'm not sure, here is all I can find about their reserves:
* The BIT's fees and expenses-which may be substantial regardless of any positive return- will offset the BIT's trading profits.
* The trust will not generate any income and regularly sells/distributes bitcoins to pay for its ongoing expenses. Therefore, the amount of bitcoin represented by each share gradually declines over time.

Ok, well at least you will have a W4 which will help your burden on taxes. You're just going to have to keep a really good record of each pay check, and how much you converted to fiat and at what price on what date.

@_date: 2017-02-14 00:58:44
**Get the Bitcoin**
* Visit  (make account, add bank account/Visa)
* Buy Bitcoin
**Store your Bitcoin in a "Vault"**
* Buy either this(I love Ledgers products):  
* or this(I love Trezor as well): 
* Setup 3 or 3a following instructions provided (**FOLLOW THE BACKING UP PART, IT'S IMPORTANT** If you take a quick search through history of you will account for hundreds of bits lost forever, qq Satoshi :( )
**Transfer Bitcoin to Vault**
* Send Bitcoin to your new wallet from Coinbase : 
**Setup hot wallet** *This is your every day buying wallet, store small sums of coins on here*
* Android: Mycelium 
* IoS: Copay
*bias included in the app selection*
There you have it, you have successfully safely stored Bitcoins. There is always more you can do, but this is the basic practice everyone should be taking IMHO.
**Some of my extra steps you might ask?**
* Make paper wallet using BIP38 encryption, (I was going to tell you to buy one of these, but they're not selling anymore :( 
* use scanner/printer that will never EVER touch the Internet. 
* print paper wallet public/private key x 2
* print seed x 2
* laminate (
* This part is up to you; hide them, store them, give them to wife, bury them, These laminated QR codes and words are the keys/backup to the wallet. If anyone gets them, you're fucked.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:02:46
No, if they were the same he would of said anonymity, not privacy.
And the simple counter to giving your information out, is don't use those services. Use local bitcoins, and you can keep your anonymity if that is what you desire.

What if they already accepted it but not publicly?
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:11:08
I can concur with that, however there was something going on in those times. Gavin releases BIP 101, Blocks are full, CWS is Satoshi, MTGox hack etc.
Those buying Litecoin at these prices are pretty much just taking over the bags people have been holding for the last 1.5 year that can finally cash out.
Maybe *this time is different* I'm no oracle so I couldn't say either way I suppose ;) I just know that this pump has nothing to do with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:04:11

@_date: 2017-03-30 13:05:04
Yes, as it has done several times over the past years to only trap noobs and dump on them. It's not pumping because of segwit, as that has remained unchanged as at ~20%
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:10:57
No hate on your post meant, was just pointing out the extreme inconsistency we get around here.
As we can see the voting system works perfect to keep non Bitcoin topics off the front page of /bitcoin yet we have mods who think otherwise and choose to manually censor post.

Definition of 'Dollar-Cost Averaging - DCA' The technique of buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the share price. More shares are purchased when prices are low, and fewer shares are bought when prices are high.

Sorry it inconvenienced you some what, but if you're trading there are risk. If you want no risk, hold the Bitcoin yourself off a centralized exchange.
You would be singing a completely different tune if this was different; Say they didn't halt trading, they were DDOS, hacked, and all your coins were lost forever?

Well put OP! This is great I have never heard this before! :)
Sadly though, this is the social world, not just observable in Bitcoin. It comes down to self responsibility/self policing/self awareness.
No one is going to fix anything for you, no one is going to stop someone else from doing something, no one is going to ever do anything for you meaningful besides you for yourself.
If you don't agree with something after doing valid research &amp; having meaningful discussions/debates, don't subscribe to it. If someone choses ignorance over reason, let them. If people want to be in an echo chamber, put on your ear buds and walk away.
The world is only what you chose to make of it. I'm living in a Country where people literally choose consumerism and ignorance over self preservation and pushing the human species even further along in The Kardashev scale. It's ok though, let them fuck it all up, you don't have to be a part of it any longer.
Civilization and humans are on such a massive tipping point and the majority isn't even aware there are things outside of nightly tv schedules. Evolution and Darwin will take care of them.

yeah so worthless, can't make any money with those, complete trickery.... You don't understand something it is ok. That however does not mean because you don't understand it it's bullshit.

as someone who witnessed it I can tell you it was a mixture of things and I'm sure I will miss some cause I'm doing this off the cuff but what sticks out most to me:
* China "Bans" Bitcoin, this was the first occurrence, made it so banks could not interact with any BTC exchange (wire transfers, payment processing).
* MT Gox was responsible for mismanagement of ~850,000 Bitcoins (70% of BTC trading took place on MTGOX during this period) and had to shut down.
* Mania, uncertainty associated with get rick quick dreams pumped by the media.

You're so dead on with this. This is also awakening to me for the reason that if I stop practicing these traditional methods, what might I miss out on development wise?
As right now I host my own node, generate my wallets, secure them, and keep up to date with talk about possible network changes. They're all connected.
Now this isn't to say there is no use for the Trezor, this will be a fine holding area for coins that I know will be moved around. My deep storage can remain in it's safe cold place :)

pretty sure around 14 min he said it did not kick in because the threshold was not hit. The threshold is much higher for a market order vs liquidation orders. Liquidation has the "speed bumps" at "we should assume around 10%" the market orders he never disclosed.
Either way, margin trading and expecting a company to safe guard you is laughable. You're margin trading which is 10000000% more risky than not. Those who got "fucked" were using margin irresponsibly by not using stop losses and other tools to protect their positions.
Like I said, I trade BFX and yesterday was a very profitable day, these are the days we all wait for as we sit staring at charts from week to week. But I also didn't have a single market order, nor did I spam a button to close my position.

@_date: 2015-08-04 20:50:58
Hey thanks :)
So it's not a very rationale feeling. They're very professional and practice some good due-diligence, some examples.
* The box in which the Trezor is in, has a Hologram sticker, and they used this crazy adhesive on all sides, so if someone opens the box, you're going to know they did (unless someone in the middle of the shipping had the box template and repackaged them).
* mytrezor.com is pretty clean and easy to follow, their setup was very thorough and ensures that you have a hard copy of your seed. Also, the entire setup process the computer only facilitates as an instructor, any important information or input is done in tangent with the physical trezor device, therefore any compromised computer will not compromise the integrity of the Trezor.
* mytrezor.com it is pretty damn easy to use, and has a very fresh looking UI.
I think I'm getting this feeling because I feel as if I'm giving up control possibly (and I guess I'm learning a little bit about myself, and acknowledging that I am a bit of a control freak). I'm accustomed to generating the addresses, backing them up, securing them, and maintaining their security. 
Trezor can now do all of this for me, I just need to convince myself they can do it as good or better then me (which most likely they can, but here I am in this internal debate).
Thanks for listening/helping me talk this out some :)

This is actually why I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin and the End of Money. Not only did they educate people about Bitcoin, and the awesome possibilities of blockchain backed systems.
But they also dropped a lot of knowledge about the Feds origins, they're intended role, and the abomination they have become in a very easy to digest and understand way for the average viewer. These are very important things that every single US resident should be aware of.

This is going to get you laughed at. Why would they want to pay you a % of transactions unless you're brining something with a track record to the table. 
The other option to take this price model is if you were investing some capital, I'll give you $25,000 and take .25% of all sales until my 25k is paid back, and then .05% on sales after repayment for agreed upon of time.
In all honesty you should charge something around $500 - $600 that is $20/hour, not bad for ordering a Tablet, setting up BitPay, and adding this guy to some coinmaps and posting on /reddit about it.

I travel a lot, hell I'm on a plane right now flying back from Puerto Rico, I use Expedia all the time. Jet blue fly-fi ftw!
A month or two ago I switched to using Expedia app instead of the browser. The app doesn't have an option to pay with Bitcoin, thus, I haven't spent any bitcoin with Expedia in two months, which would of been about $12000 USD.
Many people have been switching to their app I see it in every airport, just so fucking convenient.  
So add pay with Bitcoin to your mobile app and I bet you will have more Bitcoin transactions then ever Expedia.

Think of it this way.
No one controls/owns/protects/patents/etc the name Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a popular name.
Bcash is trying to steal the brand to dupe new comers in to buying their product that is VASTLY different from Bitcoin
In the modern world, if I made a McDonaldss. Everything looked the same, stores were the same, logo was the same (with one tiny tweak I added an extra s) McDonalds would send you a cease and deceit.
Because we're decentralized there is no *one* to defend/combat/send such cease and deceit letter. But it is up to us personally to combat bullshit as no court of law will do this for you (and we're not asking it to).
tl;dr Bcash literally did nothing besides copy and paste code and add 8MB blocks, and now are trying to call it "The real bitcoin" even though 4 people control the entire network. 
No one controls Bitcoin.
Hope this helps.

I've been a contributor to this community for 5 years �� 1) the only reason to pay those fees is if you needed to be included in the exact next block, which many do not. I never paid those fees and had no issues. 2) the only reason fees were that high is because of coordinated spam attacks, not actual use. Segwit makes it much more difficult (expensive) to do these attacks, which is why we do not see them as often.

* Bitcoin Fees were averaged at $50 today? What? Mean transactions 2/8/18 was ~5s/b (
* Admitted he sold a good portion of his Bitcoin for Bcash (which we already knew but has denied on several occasions) 
* Is OK supporting Craig Wright a known scammer/impersonator of Satoshi...?( So bcash is Satoshi's real vision, and Craig says hes Satoshi... Sooooooo..?)?
* Why no talk about Bitcoin Classic, Bitcion Unlimited, NY2X? These are forks/almost forks he also convinced people to follow, pumped, and then let burn.
* Ver is a victim, Bcash is a victim; everyone is attacking them, they're completely innocent. **Uhh wot?** Ver was literally attacking Bitcoin for a whole year with Jihan Wu/Bitmain abusing their hash power to block important upgrades that the users (**You know, the Peer to Peer mentioned in the title of the paper**) wanted/demanded.
* He controls several domains/twitter accounts/socket puppets/paid follows/promoted post/the list goes on to push agenda with 0 facts. But somehow complains that this is what 'core blockstream' is doing because they're run by Bilderberg Group.
* Bcash outperformed Bitcoin every day/week/month.. Huh???

Indeed, they're quite fun :) They also get a lot of data, it's basically a sensor that sniffs for Mac Addresses. 
I know, what you're thinking "Cab000se, you're tracking us?!" No, Don't worry, unless I work for the NSA I have no way to marry a Mac Address to a person, unless at some point I was able to make a note of one's device mac address.
SO mainly these things track hands-free headsets/cars Mac Addy, as phones discoverable windows are so short they're typically not seen while driving... 
Although, next generation bluetooth is always on, so those will then be seen. But again, unless I physically had your phone in my hand and made note of your Mac, there is no way for me to tie that to you.
The next project I'm looking at is a way to develop toll tag readers that would work with a cell phone app paying for tolls with Bitcoin as a driver enters/exists a toll road.
Hope you don't mind off topic rants :P
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:49:22
Because they're not trading Bitcoin. They're trading shares of GBTC. A trust holds Bitcoin which backs the shares that are being traded.
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:36:46
You obviously have no clue about how the sellers acquired their shares.
I'll expand..
The only ones who actually own any Bitcoin when trading GBTC is The Bitcoin Investment Trust. Those buying and selling GBTC do not actually own Bitcoin.
So it's not like if you have 5000 coins you just show up and fill that guys bid as you would on an exchange like Bitstamp. You need to be issued shares of GBTC to sell on the market.
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:10:55
By the time they got that money out of OTC, on to an exchange, the price would already of caught up.
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:41:56

@_date: 2015-04-30 12:24:41
no, there are already people that have been holding shares for a year+. But that is why I say, if you look back to when some of these people bought their shares, they paid much more than even $350.
Some paid less as well, so always the possibility to see them sell, but if they have held this long, why would they sell now and not wait for a better price?
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:15:11

@_date: 2015-04-27 22:32:12
Ha, exactly. 
I ended up in an almost 2 hour meeting discussing the whole logistics of it. The downer portion of this is, it might be more expensive for us to use Bitcoin due to the fee it will cost to buy through a "trusted" service like Coinbase.
We may be able to use Circle for 0% fee however.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:06:11
I disagree, over the past year I have made about 50 Bitcoin using this voodoo u all speak of.
There is just no method that always works or an indicator that is always right, but there are definitely patterns and market physiology recognition that is used to make trades. It's just finding them, which is where TA comes in.

If you want to sell shares of GBTC you have to hold the shares for at least a year.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:39:56
You just do it, learn as you make trades.
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:08:04
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:26:51
why would anyone sell at these prices? You have to realize there are many people who paid well above 350.
There seems to be a lot of confusion about GBTC here. These people are not trading Bitcoin. They are trading shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust. A trust that owns Bitcoin, and has made each share worth .1 Bitcoin (for now).

Correct, IF they had the money all set ready to buy the instant they sold. But if they sold, the market would immediately follow. So they would have to front run the money at a different exchange or OTC.

No, they have a bid for $35 x 50000 shares.
10 shares = 1 Btc.

This graph is purely for picking/tracking bubble movements and targets. The move depicted in this chart actually could take us in the range of $30,000. 
Predicting time lines is pretty much impossible from what I have learned. So yes you're correct the liftoff looks a bit intense laid over where we are currently. But it isn't to imply that this is starting this instant(but it could), but more within this price range between now and July.

Hmmm, way to quote me out of context :P


Moreover, I was replying to the above comment where there was no mention of transaction re-ordering, but simply overdraft fees incurring on overdraft fees.
So to be very clear, transaction re-ordering is complete bullshit and should be done away with. I don't know why they can't run it like a clearing house at the end of the day if they're using a half-ass system. Take the total credits and debits for the day, we're you negative or positive? IF negative **1** over draft charge, not multiple.

Yup exactly this.
Everyone is/was obsessed with the notion that wall st money was going to get involved and then all Bitcoin holders would be rich. That ship came and went. How do I know this?
We have Coinbase, and ItBit, AND hmmm what was the name of that again???? You probably forgot as well, [GBTC]( There are/have been ample opportunity for big institutional money to get involved, they're not doing it. They're making investments in startups/alternative blockchain based options.
Most likely if you didn't get in this game early, you're not going to get rich holding Bitcoin. However, you can get rich building something around Bitcoin or providing something useful.
Anyway, here comes the downvote ship.

Typically this means you're investing too much.
You need to find a value in which you do not need to check in on every minute of the day. Then keep adding to that slowly over time. Eventually you're stash has grown and you can look at investing a small % of it on exchanges to try and make more Bitcoins with your Bitcoin :)

The most intresting thing to me, is they're going to use bitpay, meaning bitpay has been working with them on drafting this up... This is gonna lead to lots of back door deals, which sadly government doesn't need anymore of.

we went down to $450, that my friend is a crash.
The thing you need to realize is that bitcoin because it is traded 24/7 time moves very fast. So that crash only lasted a few days, unlike other markets that take weeks, months, years to recover from crashes. 
People are still chanting we're due for a crash, yet it just happened, and they missed the boat, yet again.

@_date: 2013-03-26 07:41:34
Honestly this is a two prong question. (and completely my own opinion)
First off, Technically, there is no way *currently or in the near future* bitcoint will be able to replace cash/other currencies because it cannot process enough transactions yet. The amount of computing power/establishments that are out there monitoring every transaction is mind boggling.
Second, if BTC becomes a threat to USD/EU/Renminbi/ruble (to name a few) those in charge of those super banks, wont just sit there idle and watch BTC take over, they will take action. This can be done by imposing a tax per transaction, incredible fees for patriating currency, or a straight up confiscation of all BTC (just like we saw in USA with gold 1933).
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:02:53

I agree there is a difference.
Your examples are dull though. For instance, sure you could trade for marbles. But can you instantly trade your marbles for gift cards anywhere you have an internet connection? No.
Point being, we already have systems in place that allow us to seamlessly shop such big names as Amazon and Target without them expressing any interest in accepting Bitcoin. As long as services like these keep growing, it won't matter if the sheep, or big box stores accept them, we don't need them.
In-fact, if people want Bitcoin to succeed we need to keep developing products/services that help our integration in to the world, rather then hoping/waiting for said things to accept us. For if we don't create our own growth, those Bitcoin threatens, will ensure Bit doesn't get a chance.

Yea the first few takes a while, but once you're tier2 verified it's a lot smoother. The bank withdraws always take longer though. Which is nice if you sell locally. You can buy what you need then deposit the cash in your bank account before they withdraw.

I work with semi-young web developers from Shanghai. Recently(last week) we flew them in for a collaborative project I was working on with them.
They are in their mid 20's and have never heard of Bitcoin. They talked with some of their peers over a few days, and it seems that they didn't know anyone who had ever heard of bitcoin. 
I sent them both home with their own wallet :)

appreciate the support everyone. :)
I don't think persistence is ambiguous of crazy. Bitcoin a really good alternative and much easier then a lot of people think, and that is the message to get across.
Transferring bitcoin to fiat is very easy using merchant tools such as bitpay, so if you're paid with btc your not stuck with it, and to convert it is cheaper then credit card transactions in a lot of cases. (Generally people are paying high fees accepting credit cards).
Being an early adapter is always the key to capturing a target market, so persistence is just our way of showing them that there are a growing number of people who want to see this. 
Even more so, I love spotify, as do a lot of us, and what an awesome way to grow bitcoin then with something you actually find value in.
I don't think that is crazy :D

I don't see cloud based being a solution either (although I see exactly where you're coming from, and it is logical) reasons why:
A) Dependent on the company(cloud) remaining in existence
B) Vulnerable to attack (hackers stealing info's/coins/all together wallet)
C) Only accessible when you have access to the internet
D) You do not own distribution rights to anything you store on a cloud, they could change how/when/what fee you pay at any given time
While typing this though I realized the solution. A service should have both. I would theoretically download a wallet, store it on my computer, I could get my private keys, and even print out my coins. But this service also stores an encrypted backup file of your wallet on their cloud.
To get this file you would have to have an app of some sort that generated a key that would be a unique identifier used at account creation, in order to decrypt the file when needed. Thus remaining safe on the cloud (theoretically).

deal with what? go to bitcoin.org download wallet, install wallet, you're done.
ps, I agree that it needs to be easy for people to use, imo it already is once you HAVE your BTC. Getting BTC for the general consumer is a nightmare currently. But it's much like the early state of the Internet. Only professors, enthusist, and government agencies used it to share information for research. 
It was not until Netscape made the first browser that we saw the internet truly begin to be adopted by the masses. Bitcoin needs a netscape, something to allow the general public to obtain bitcoin without any knowledge of how bitcoin works.

no one is talking about the internet being destroyed, we're talking about a global meltdown. Which would entail people surviving on the community level, where you would have no access to btc for a week/month/year who knows.
I just read all these optimistic post about people of Cyprus transferring their currency to BTC, or how those on the Euro should buy BTC because it would be more stable/secure. It's just not true.
BTC is a fiat currency just like any other out there, and ever more vulnerable to being manipulated. You do realize that government control the power grids, which are paid for by taxes. If we're all going to switch to BTC who is going to pay for these grids that keep BTC running? Or the roads that get employees to the power plant to generate the power for all those miners, or the water treatment plants that all of us rely on? 
I'm not against BTC at all, I just don't ever see these issues being talked about.

if the price is $20. You charge 20$ worth of bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-07-02 14:32:14
say what you want, we need name recognition like this to get BTC really going mainstream. I for one, am happy these two are so invested in BTC.
Edit: the best part is, this is is a straight up competition between Winkloevoss and Zuckerberg. Mark has been looking in to BTC as well for facebook. I heard somewhere you can buy facebook credits with bitcoin now. (Not 100% sure about that...)

I think you're right. The problem is these Politicians would have public addresses. So, being someone who wanted to buy influence without anyone from the public knowing. I would tell said Politician I am donating 111.11112 to your account at on X date, at 1:11. Done properly no one would know where that money came from.
I don't know if Politicians can take cash legally.

those "real coins" are made with brass silver and gold, which would take the value of brass silver and gold, not the value of fiat btc, which is determined by a traders market.

@_date: 2013-03-26 07:32:36
Primarily in today's culture this is true. 
Given my scenario we would be under a completely different set of rules. Granted, I think initially survival necessitates would be better traded, but eventually a currency would be established, where you would have to trade in what ever you had, those with gold/silver have a better chance of being those with the largest exchange rate. But who knows, those with Corn seeds could be the new gold bearers.
But wow, am I ever speculating, lol. thanks for the thought provocation!

You're correct, it's just the convenience you get with Dwolla.
There are a lot of people intimidated by going to a bank and wiring money across the world. It was kind of freaky the first time I did it, there is a lot of trust in the process. Whereas a third party helps put people mind at ease, give them money they do the rest for you no fuss. 
At the bank filling out addresses and what not seems kind of sketchy to most I'm sure.

I might of over-generalized that statement a bit. But with all the talk of people of Cyprus moving their savings to BTC and the Euro next it's not that far off the current mentality. (again generalizing off current hype :P)

this by far, I have used many methods
* Bank xfer to mtgox
* bank xfer to liberty reserve to mtgox
* bank xfer to ecardone
* bitinstant.com
Coinbase is the easiest/cheapest method out there. You can lock in current market prices, and just have to wait a few days for the BTC to get to you.
Also, coinbase is the only service you can do 100% from your couch (that I'm aware of currently)

Right, a lot of us here do understand the fundamentals. But it is important for you to read it, and critique it, rather than just skimming through in like a high school student.
This way, constructive criticism/the facts, make their way back to the people who will be writing such documents that other regulators/legislators/economist/business/eventually public will get their hands on.

"Well a world bombed back to the 18th century seems to be on the cards according to OP, so I humored the likelihood of that notion with my own equally likely scenario."
no where did I say anything about a bombing, we have been on/we're on the brink of a world wide collapse currently.
"Going for ad hominem attacks right off the bat hu?"
No It's nothing personal, but your generalization is very narrow, there are many places in this world even in this day and age where power/technology is not a given. Hell, clean water/safe food isn't even a given everywhere.
"These are based on cryptographic principles, so yeah, they've exist. m of n is already implemented, tested, verified, reproduced, useable, whatever. Maybe you should watch the video."
Yes you can't replicate bitcoin, we know. This doesn't change the fact that these things are not yet fully implemented in to existing economies. You're assuming that this currency will take off and be hands free. Ya right, you think if you live in USA you're just going to be able to hand over all your wealth in BTC to your inherent bypassing estate tax? Maybe, maybe not, it has not been accepted/implemented/matured yet for us to answer that one question. Think of how many other millions of questions we have yet to answer.

"all sales are final"
They made it very clear, so I would say it's pretty much impossible. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:49:04
**your first point:** You don't need a central bank, central banks are the woes of all of our current problems. Just like anything, why would you stick all your savings in to one basket? I sure as hell don't, it's called diversification, something I'm sure you're well aware of.
**Your second point:** the volatility does not matter to merchants, you list your price in USD, EUR, CNY, etc. Then you use services such at bitpay that will allow you to instantly exchange your BTC to whatever currency you desire at the point of transaction.
**Your third point:** Again, not sure why you're talking about putting entire savings in to one thing, that is just amateur and stupid. Moreover, you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, people can buy .1 .01 .5, what ever denomination you would like.
**Your final point:** You can do the same exact thing with cash that you can do with bitcoin. Government appose to bitcoin? Could you please link me sources, because in the Senate hearings and from Ben Bernake, they all seem to be quite interested in bitcoin, and want to make sure they don't stifle innovation (which they have already been doing, thus USA will be playing catch-up in the cryptocurrency world).

My point is that Windows has the shittiest app store around, due to the fact they're so late to the game. IOS or Android is the much better option via functionality.
Windows Apps doesn't even really have a good validation system, so tons of scammers are making apps that are stealing your personal information. Or in this case, possibly BTC's (who knows though making a wild aqusation lol).

how do you expect to do that when the largest buying population can no longer easily buy?
We have quite a bit of selling to take place yet, the only reason there is buying pressure on BTCChina is people buying BTC to move it to a different exchange.
This down trend will be shorter than the previous if the S-Curve is to hold, but I don't think we've stabilized yet.

Why in the world would we want to talk about possible world reserve currency before we have even established a mainstream use on the Internet?
Bitcoins competitive advantage is that it is peer to peer, across the world. That is what you should work on, and capturing 80% of all online transactions, THAN talk about a possibility for a world reserve. **Currently (and for the next 10 years)** Bitcoin is far too infant to even be compared to gold/silver/fiat. 
**tl;dr** BTC needs to dominate online transactions before we even consider it as a alternative currency to traditional methods (fiat/gold/silver/etc)

I think your optimism makes you blind. You're talking about making an infant a king, it just doesn't happen.
Let's face it bitcoin is not popular yet, it's growing though and we need to help it grow and be accepted. 
But consumers HATE change, it a proven fact. So to say your going to change anybody's currency this early in the game is naive.
We need to explain how bitcoin can be used NOW not in this magical world where everyone understands and uses bitcoin as a currency. It needs to be introduced as an online alternative to credit cards, PayPal, money gram, etc. Once this is accomplished, and bitcoin is exposed and used, it will naturally start growing and being adapted in such ways you describe. But it is not going to happen backwards, from currency to online exchange.

@_date: 2013-03-26 08:10:48
that is really cool!
but isn't this the same exact thing we see with most current currencies? That is awesome there is a coin that will be BTC specific, but there is no actual value behind it other that people believe in its value.

" in ww2 they had power and technology" Yeah, the Germans did. But those rebelling typically moved outside of the grid and lived off the earth.
Moreover, as you said; "There are applications built into the Bitcoin system that are not even actively used yet which go far and beyond a simple currency." Theoretically that is great. Does it exist, is it tested, have the results been verified/reproduced? No.

I will have to agree though, until there is some regulation in the states, you're not going to get a company like Activision/Blizzard accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:08:50
Yeah I think you're right. If BTC was looked at as an alternative transaction method, I totally get that. But as a currency used to replace almost every world currency, I don't think so.
Also, a diverse portfolio is always the best thing an investor can do to secure their future. :D

Very cool!
I'm doing the same exact thing this year, and I thought of opening it up to the public, but I could never figure out how to get around that one flaw. People just have to trust that you would throw it away.
But realistically, people shouldn't be keeping their coins on this paper wallet to begin with, it would be more of a means for one to introduce others to bitcoin easily, and give it a physical presence. 
Good luck to you both, and happy holidays!

It's great news. But far from replacing the volume BTCChina was responsible for.
BTC is not dead by any means with out China, just lost a lot of volume for now is all. The price will take quite some time to recover from that.

This video is about a flash crash that took place on May 6th 2010 on the NYSE.
Figured everyone would enjoy it, because it sounds like the same exact thing that happened last week with Mt. Gox.
Money &amp; Speed: Inside the Black Box is a thriller based on actual events that takes you to the heart of our automated world. Based on interviews with those directly involved and data visualizations up to the millisecond, it reconstructs the flash crash of May 6th 2010: the fastest and deepest U.S. stock market plunge ever. 
Money &amp; Speed: Inside the Black Box is developed by filmmaker Marije Meerman in close collaboration with design studio Catalogtree. This explorative documentary is a marriage of strong storytelling and meticulous visual analysis. A rare opportunity to experience what is happening inside the black boxes of our rapidly evolving financial markets.

you beat me to it!
It is important to note that the person who "took it" offered to give it back. Then Matt said he could keep it. This title makes it seem like a crime happened, when in actuality, the person really took it off the wallet for the greater good.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:16:54
My local bank treats me really well, they advised me the first time I went to wire money to Gox last year, probably not to do it. But they still went ahead and did it because I wanted to.
They basically told me not to blame them if my money went missing.
&lt;3 local stuff

If him and the owner agree, I don't see why the bank has anything to do with this at all. My father and I have bought houses for cash, the only thing the bank had to do with it is the guy depositing his cash.
Edit: unless the guy doesn't own the house, just a mortgage, which is probably the situation. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 07:21:17
Wow that is super awesome!
but again your dependent on power. Just look at Katrina/Hurricane Sandy. Even those who had all the most up-to-date technology was left holding a bunch of bricks because they had no way to charge it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:14:09
I almost bought one of these as well but then I realized some key things that most likely are going to destroy any hope of this being viable in the states:
* Good luck getting people to have their hand biometric scanned, picture taken via camera from the atm, and input all their personal information.
* Oh yeah, don't forget to get your money transmission license through FinCEN. That may or may not cover you in the future.
* Oh, and get ready to pay [fees out the ass]( to Robocoin for maintaining this thing 
* If regulation rules against bitcoin, you have a $20,000 paper weight 
Good luck to this guy though, hopefully it really takes off, he has way bigger balls than I do taking the risk so soon I must admit.

way to post about a topic you clearly have done 0 research on.
ps. your bitcoins are fine.
pss. the moment you can login, transfer your coins to a secure wallet, this should become your normal routine, trusting funds to 3rd parties when you don't need to is just silly. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:16:19
they're great, the wait is meh, but whatever, they lock in prices so it's a win for you, and a win for them sometimes. That is the nature of the beast.

Very true, with most basic LVDs, you can even throttle how much V your using, fine tuning it down to the lowest amount of power needed could easily drop power consumption. 
Example: I have some IP cameras that came with a 12v AC power adapter, but I only need 5V DC to run them.

your guess is as good as any.
This could be our stable point, or we could go down to 250-300 area and stabilize, or 100-200, who knows.
What I do know, is don't invest more than you could lose tomorrow.

regulations that are passed in the financial institution has very little to do with what the American people think. Moreover, a lot of this is done behind closed doors.

another blackmarket bites the dust. Again, people fail to see how this is good news for bitcoin, no apocalypse here.
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:07:21
Methods I've used (this has evolved quite a bit so I will do it in order)
*Bank Transfer money to Liberty Reserve, Transfer E-Money TO MTGox
*Transfer money to ecardone.com buy bitcoin directly
*Bank transfer money directly to MT Gox
* 
* 
Honestly, my favorite of them is the latter, coinbase. If you're not trying to buy huge amounts at a time, it is the way to go.
I stopped doing bank transfers because the fee's were just so damn high. I'm talking about $47USD on any xfer &lt;$500 and $94 for anything &gt;$500

if you're not interested in trading and you just want to buy coins. I would recommend bitinstant or ecardone.com
I have use ecardone, and their customer service is amazing/speedyness. 
Bitinstant I myself have not used, but I know many who swear by it.

You don't even have to be as extreme as mad max. Some argue we're at peak oil. The implications of that alone for our live time are much more serious than you're alluding to.
Cheap oil affects everything in our life, transportation of labor/food/materials, Heating/cooling, Food preparation, running farms/equipment, producing almost everything we use. Just the collapse of oil alone would send our world in to catastrophe, which *very well could* happen in our lifetime.
This would send us back to 1780's where those in control of the essential commodities rule all.
