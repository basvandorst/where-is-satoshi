The "zero fee" blurb is a little misleading. The pool way not charge a fee but p2pool has a 0.5% fee built in for the solving node. So its not technically 0% from the miners perspective.

so $0.50 on a $2.00 is meant to cover fraud? Credit cards cannot support microtransactions. Also your comparison of bitcoin to CC is invalid anyways. It would be more apt to compare the credit card tech to bitcoin. When we do that you can easily see there is nothing inherent about CCs that prevent fraud.

The problem is you're viewing the bitcoin protocol as a complete financial system, this is quite a common mistake. Bitcoin vs cash is a better comparison. If you were to give the wrong person a cash payment for some goods / services, you'd likely not see your money again, this holds true in bitcoin as well (though the software prevents you from sending to an incorrect address, it is still possible to send to the wrong address). If you were to pay cash for some goods, it's up to the store to provide any return should you not like the goods, this also holds true in bitcoin.
One particular issue with the current system is, while good for consumers, accepting credit cards carries some risk for the business. Some of the companies allow chargebacks to happen 6+ months after purchase, meaning that up to 6 months after you sell your product to a customer, they can (possibly) fraudulently demand a chargeback from their company and never see their goods nor payment. A business accepting bitcoin as a payment has no such risk on purchases made with bitcoin as it's very difficult (read next to impossible) to reverse a payment.

These articles are always a hoot. In the end there will not be just BTC, that is a naive thought in the least. BTC may be fine for the internet but real life transactions are only possible with SPV or having the full blockchain. I see a coin with quicker transaction times being used over BTC for daily spending. Another thing that invalidates this, what will happen when a company is formed that does instant exchange of XXX for BTC or ethereum / ixc / other smart contract coins start to get used and handles the instant exchange? BTC will not be the only coin in the end.

I am not incorrect: 
"A subsidy of 0.5% is sent to the node that solved the block in order to discourage not sharing solutions that qualify as a block. (A miner with the aim to harm others could withhold the block, thereby preventing anybody from getting paid. He can NOT redirect the payout to himself.) The remaining 99.5% is distributed evenly to miners based on work done recently."
under payout logic

"....paying a drug cartel with serialized bills and seeing that that bill ends up in some bank in the USA only has the beginning and endpoints visible."
This is also a horrible method of tracking. Take for instance some dollars were used in an attempt to track a cartels money movements. Then say the cartel decides he wants a coke on the way home from the meeting and stops by the story to buy one and hands the guy a dirty 5 dollar bill. The next person receives that as change and eventually deposits it into their bank, triggering a false positive. Now they're getting snooped on due to "possible involvement with illicit actvitiy"

in p2pool you're mining on an altchain of shares, when an actual block is found to incentivize the node to broadcast it they are allowed to give themselves 0.5% of the block reward, the remaining 95% is distributed to the rest of the miners so no p2pool is truely 0%

Well, assuming John Q Public is an employee and getting paid in BTC, somewhere along the line someone will report some income or expenses paid to him, if he files a report that doest match he would probably be facing an audit.
Now assuming John Q Public is a miner, at some point he may want to swap the BTC for USD / EUR which, depending on the method used, may create a paper trail (it will if John Q Public is obeying the law). And again, if he files a return and there is a discrepancy he will be likely facing another audit.
The only way you can escape taxes with BTC is by using it for everything, and ensuring you only use dealers / shops that don't report BTC income (or all of it). Living while constantly dodging the IRS doesn't sound like a fun way to live, nor even feasible if John has a wife and/or kids.

Please go to cryptsy and check any chart other than LTC/BTC.
"Not to mention, regardless of being (SOME) down in value vs BTC, many (most) are up in fiat."
Since almost every (important) exchange quotes alts in BTC and not fiat (due to more stringent MSB requirements) this statement must mean that if altcoins rise in fiat value then BTC also does.
"see, this just proves you don't actually know anything..."

This isnt directly related but soon (at least in the BTC world) most will be operating on zero conf transactions, therefore most will need to lose the concept of block times.
Another note, the shorter the block time the less time an attacker needs to maintain network control in order to fork the chain. I'm at a loss for specific examples but this caused death (due to lack of confidence) of a few alts in the past.
Yet another note, most "lightweight" alts were created at a time when zero conf transactions were just being experimented with. The general thought at the time was that mobile clients couldn't handle a full node without draining the battery and many alts formed to address this issue

I think most users missed the point of this post so I will just respond to the comment OP, but it applies to most child comments of this post.
It is not easy to integrate with a payment processor. Sites and apps using Google Wallet to process payments are now searching for a new solution and must imply went these changes. For non-techies this is no big deal, "just switch to a new processor" they'll say. Once you integrate with one payment processor you'll understand what a big deal is. Not to mention, what happens when your next processor pulls the plug? You'll be right back at it again. However its impossible for someone to pull the plug on BTC (the protocol, not the currency) and therefore would not have these issues.

Correct, however your private key is within the HSM (Hardware Security Module) and the software utilizing the device sends request to the module to sign transactions. If someone takes your HSM they have your keys, and since these phones pop apart for reconfiguration this should be relatively easy no? Then take your HSM back to the workbench and crack whatever pw you had to send authorized signatures (assuming there was one).

We're talking about a site that allows the posting of articles and peer review of said articles, not too much needs to be done here to increase value proposition (do scholar websites really compete? seems counter-intuitive to the goal of collaboration).
At any rate the backend isn't the problem, about 2-3 hours of work and a competent django / python coder could have user auth, pdf uploading and moderated commenting done.
 -- most of this already exists

that's horrible, most "store" apps will already have external payment processing that handle purchases for tangible goods. app upgrades is where this would be used mostly
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:26:13
yes, many times

haha yea like the whole store? looks great, is this just a concept or will you release it?

Bitcoin doesn't require as much bandwidth as one may think. I have charts from two machines running full nodes averaging 200kbps (usually lower) with whatever the default client count is. I'd post the charts but they have HTTP traffic interpolated so its not clean.

reach out, there are plenty of individuals with the knowledge on how to build and maintain a site like this. Id be willing to help.
to just get running, there's nothing wrong with using a template from themeforest or wrapbootstrap

Do they realize this makes some of us never want to use Chase's service? I for one am maintaining a list of all banks that are putting up a fight against BTC and will not be using them myself.

Try understanding what I wrote before replying

btcjam.com is the primary source atm, keep in mind BTC is still new so few lending services exist yet. In a BTC-centric economy p2p lending is less risky (given smart contracts) and allows many people to invest in the loan rather than just a single bank or small group of individuals. One example would be in this case, they needed $450. Instead of 1 person loaning $450 you could have 450 loan $1, or 900 loan $0.50, etc. As you can see this decreases the risk exposure of each person and allows for loans in risky cases / lack of history.

or I can just keep my small sum of money under my mattress, yet society doesn't allow for someone to be unbanked.  I usually don't want or need a bank myself yet I'm forced to have one and forced to pay stupid fees so they can do no real work and still turn a profit. the era of the bank is over, thankfully
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:18:52
Just like this "can I borrow $500k from you 10k people? it's backed by my house"
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:14:09
let's also not forget that by doing so MS is utilizing one of the core features of BTC and minimizing their risks of chargebacks.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:40:52
So I'm also assuming you don't believe in multi chain implementations and the utility. From a developers standpoint no, Bitcoin and related technologies will always be around, as I for one use it in a few projects unrelated to finance already. Also even if a gov regulates BTC into non-existence there will still be those that use it.
Quit supporting the trolls.

If this is indeed the case someone from p2pool should update the wiki. What method are they using to solve the block withholding issue now?

Who cares? China does NOT form policy in any country but their own. If you live in China and want to use BTC, just leave.
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:47:11
getblocktemplate people, the solution has existed for some time. destroying mining pools is not the way to go about this, has been recently proposed on the BTC Dev mailing list and promptly got ignored.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:43:38
if that node pays out the 0.5% yes, otherwise there would be no difference
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:25:43
OK, so this would fix UX issues, but what about the full nodes? Is there a Java solution for a full node BTC client other than bitcoinj where we could perhaps provide both SPV and full node options?
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:29:49
Multisig / escrow, already exists

So this explains why BTC is on the altcoin death spiral and DOGE isn't!! Such wow!!

There still is loans, its just P2P now: btcjam.com

Sure, I've used PayPal to send money to my parents before, it only took 4 days to clear

I like it because for $0 I can download some sw and start taking payments on my website for 0 fees to me. There is not another payment system on the planet that allows for that. Then when I want to build my own interface for my accounts, instead of the shitty one the banks give me, I can easily do so. Using Bitcoin feels like what money should feel like today, yet we still have old systems requiring multiple days to clear checks. FFS we can perform open heart surgery, but it takes 4 days for money to clear via check. Then these fees, why am I charged $2.50 to use an ATM? Does it actually cost $2.50? If so then OK (and I'd like to see proof) What if I wanted to tip some random guy $0.01 on the internet for some help he's given me? The fees of our old system alone will kill that transaction. Fiat eventually will be phased out with something in favor of an electronic currency, the benefits are much greater than the typical trust based system we're using now.

yea not gonna happen. Good job MS for accepting BTC but they still have a ways to go to get my business back. Switching windows to a proper *nix kernel would be a good start.

I don't agree with this part. Intrainstitutional transfers may be faster than the blockchain however in her institutional transfers are much quicker with a blockchain, given that a transaction can reach full network propagation in 5 seconds or so. Checks, CCs, transfers, these all take days with the current method and only work when the institution is open.
The rest is spot on.
For those that want a quick and dirty on what the blockchain, read into [Double Entry Accounting] (

"A mature Banking system would embargo these transactions until their legitimacy could be adjudicated. BitCoin absorbed and "confirmed" them -- this is not a legitimate currency if it fails to protect property owners."
You're right, except Bitcoin is not a "mature banking system", or a "banking system" of any kind really, it's a protocol. Cash does not protect it's owners as other users have pointed out, these services are provided by 3rd party companies. Since Bitcoin's protocol is also not capable of self insurance, companies will have to step forward to insure holdings of BTC, something that is already happening.

there's still a flaw in your plan, where did the money come from to pay for the BTC? why wasn't there taxes paid on the profit from your counterparty? not paying income taxes is not the right way to fight them

Sad that the main comment tree is from a troll. I like it for the same reasons, I can send money to my dad stateside (I'm also stateside though) for next to nothing and very quickly. He's almost 70 and can easily handle swapping them for cash or selling them online.

assuming they are storing messages in a blockchain like fashion this won't work out very well, the disk space will quickly get out of control. a new protocol needs to be invented for p2p social media, BT and BTC protos won't work IMHO

it's interesting how detached from the world he is. it started with dark wallet and now he's continuing onto the BTC foundation. non-"cryptoanarchists" don't like to see these types of statements, what will John Doe think when he sees this guy badmouthing the foundation? people like this need to be removed from the community if it's to progress. despite what they believe or want, you must woo the govs in order to not have friction for widespread adoption
