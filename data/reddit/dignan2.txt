Had my first Western Union experience a few days ago,  sent some money inside my state to a cousin of my Father as a favor.  It took 2 hours to do this.
I tried via their website.  Nope, billing address for credit card is a PO Box and even though I put physical house address that is associated with the card it would not accept.  
Only sending $120.
Ok, so I call the 800 # and talk to a representative, after 15 minutes of setting up the money transfer her informs me the fee the website said isn't valid over the phone.  Website wanted me to pay $14, Im now being quoted $25 fee , because their website won't accept a PO Box.
Ok, argh!!  Go to ATM and pull out cash, drive up to Walgreens and sit at their touchscreen terminal typing everything I had just typed in the website because the user name I created isn't working on the terminal.  20 mins typing on this stupid ass 30" touchscreen keyboard where anyone behind me can write down the passwords Im creating because the keyboard is so damn huge, not only that I had to retype things at least 4 times due to errors and it forcing you to retype everything.
Total waste of time, I almost could have driven the money to them in the time it took.  Final charge was $8 via a retail location to send $120.

You could select preferred payment method as the seller.  Before PayPal it was all via snail mail , it was either gamble with a check and call their bank before depositing or usps money order where the post office could verify if it was legitimate and just cash it right there.

I would imagine it went after power sellers listing auctions with quantity so I could hide among buyers instead of win single item auctions.

So if I go buy a stack of $2 bills from the bank and sell those to people I'm being a money transmitter?
This doesn't make sense. Plenty of businesses "sell" money , silver coins , etc. 
He's basically a middle man and the only time I can think that's illegal is if selling something illegal.  We are talking about exchanging fiat for math formulas.
