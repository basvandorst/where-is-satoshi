Not really. Those "schools" have been converging since the 50's and economics exists on a spectrum now, the list of things economists can agree upon is getting bigger and bigger each year.
Every "school" agrees that bitcoin does not qualify as a good currency.

Nobody in mainstream economics says we should only use empirical data. OBVIOUSLY something must be rationally true in order to be empirically true, but I must say, if something appears to be rationally true but empirically it cannot be demonstrated to be true (as with much Austrian theory), it doesn't mean anything and isn't worth being taken as true.
And that is the main problem with Austrians, sure maybe they do some empirical work, but overwhelmingly they will not discard their praxeology if data suggests it is not true.


I believe you mean social science, nobody calls economics a hard science.


Which methodologies?

The Austrian school isn't a real school, they don't publish any papers.

Inflation is not an increase in the money supply, it's an increase in prices.

Here is the Wikipedia definition (emphasis mine):


Furthermore they say:


That is why neither gold nor bitcoin are stores of value. Perhaps gold was in the past, but this is no longer true.

And yet fees continue to go up? It wasn't like Internet was getting worse in the 90's, whereas the transaction fees have.

Increased aggregate demand, **possibly** from an increase in the money supply, but the ratio isn't one to one. Ceteris paribus, prices would fall if we kept the money supply the same for long enough.

I know that


No they do not lol. How can you publish a study if you deny the use of the scientific method?

What does this even mean? How did you quantify this? What is a "storage failure rate"?


Yeah alright... off the top of your head, what was the value of gold in 4000 bc?
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:12
Gold doesn't' store value, it's volatile like bitcoin.

Hayek? Eugene Fama? Mundell? James M. Buchanan? Milton Friedman? What are you talking about lol?
