What are your sources to support that claim? People use FIAT for drugs also, so sure, crypto is used for them too - but "mostly"? Prove it.

That's actually a decent explanation. I will share that with my mother next time she is confused. So all the time. I will share that with her all the time. Forever. Maybe I will set it as her cell phone ring tone...

To be clear, I don't think it would crash to zero. BUT I am not so ignorant to believe that it is not possible.

Beyond misleading. Sure, a piece of paper is worse less than a physical pound of silver.   
Guess what. That piece of paper is worth more than 100 bitcoin, if you want to get technical with what it is made of. Bitcoin is worthless, 100% and always will be - that is if you are talking about the tangible value.   
The perceived value is what matters. Bitcoin is only worth $$$ just as a paper note for a pound is worth something because people agree that it is.  
Just because the hard physical value of the material representing the currency has changed, it does not mean it has lost value.

What I got out of this is more like this: Blockchain is the new technology, and crypto is simply one application of blockchain. (a better analogy really - email is to internet as crypto is to blockchain). Something like that.

Sounds terrible, but that is still 8%. Over how much time? 8% per year is more than you can make on most investments!

Those who loved Beta and/or Laserdisc thought they had the future in their hands. Then something better came along.  
Is it likely that something will come along to replace BitCoins place in the next decade? Maybe not. But not at all impossible.  There are many scenarios that could drive it down to zero, or at least near-zero.  
If There was mass adaption of global regulation against crypto it would drive it to near zero for sure.  Perhaps not TO zero, but a LOT of people would bail in a hurry.

Started to type basically the same thing then saw this :)

Love this. So many scammers taking advantage of people out there.
On the flip side, with some of these scams, I almost feel that if you are dumb enough to fall for them then you deserve to be scammed - that said, if we can put a dent in the scammers coffers that is certainly a good thing :)

I can't trust anything you post ever. You use Internet Explorer.
@_date: 2019-04-16 15:25:29
Mostly? I am getting bitcoin related scam calls daily. Mostly claiming to be Revenue Canada, but have had others as well. Not to mention the constant SPAM emails saying they have my passwords and video of me watching porn. lol.   
I have never personally had any scammer request gift cards, always bitcoin. Different regions are maybe targeted differently.

I think your 3-5 years is far too optimistic. Virtually everyone knows how to use western union to send money, and if you don't, there are places you go to talk to a human and they just do it for you.  
Comparatively virtually nobody knows how to send money via bitcoin. Sure, some people know, and do do it, but if you want to, and don't know how, where can you go to just talk to a human? Anywhere?   
Western Union (or similar type businesses) will exist for well beyond our life times.   
Say you need FIAT NOW to pay your rent. You ask your mom to send you bitcoin to help you out. Do you think this is actually easier?  
If your landlord accepts bitcoin, then yes, it just might be, but if he only accepts cash, and your mom has no idea what bitcoin is, there is no way in hell this would be easier.  
I doubt the majority of the population will be fluent enough in blockchain tech (bitcoin, eth, trx, or whatever) to be able to eliminate places like western union in the next several decades.

One year ago, one would buy you a car... Today you can buy part of a car.

It will just take a chunk out of the market, but not fully replace it.  
People thought that the automobile would replace the horse and buggy. They were wrong. I saw a horse and buggy just the other day. :D  
In the future, if you want to send money using Western Union, you'll just have to go find a machine at a seniors retirement village, or perhaps a Blockbuster video. :D

LOL. If you get your news from and believe what you read on Social Media without it being backed up by a reputable source then you have serious problems. You are what is wrong with this world - people like you are the reason Trump is in power - trusting anonymous social posts over actual reporting by reputable journalists.   
Even if the story is false, the sentiment does show value. Putting your assets into bitcoin before crossing borders, in war torn regions, or other situations where theft of tangible goods is likely would be a good way to help secure wealth. Probably what this BS post is getting at more/less to spread some value in Crypto - but they are doing it in a fear-mongering fashion which is simply not okay.

A fixer upper where I live is $400,000.  
I live in a decent middle class house built in the 70's. Nothing fancy, but a nice house. I paid $260,000 for it 6 years ago. It is now worth $600,000.  
BTC at $600,000 - I don't see that happening ever. McAffee said he'd eat his dick if it didn't reach $1,000,000 - still waiting to watch that cooking show.
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:23:55
I fully agree with this - today. I could easily see in the future this being different and more streamlined. 
You are right though, today it would SUCK to use for this purpose, especially if your goal was sending FIAT. Converting back and forth etc, etc. Just makes no sense.   
I'll go put FIAT in the machine, convert to Bitcoin, bitcoin will send to Bob at another machine, he will then convert back to Fiat, and withdraw. Makes zero sense. My grandmother would die at that machine trying to figure out WTF to do.   
Western Union is here for a long time still for sure :)

For anyone that believes this, please send me 10 BTC and I promise to send back 100.  
Better yet, send me 100 BTC and I will send back 10.  
Or more honestly, send me 1000 BTC and I will ignore you afterwards forever.

If that 5 1/4 inch drop is too much for you, just open it up on your phone, drops way less! And if you really want to minimize losses, try it on a Motorola Razr if you can find one!
