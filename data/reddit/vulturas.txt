Little Mary is walking in the park, hand-in-hand with her mother. All of a sudden, Mary points out two teens doin' it like on the Discovery Channel on a bench, pages flying off some notebooks, y'know the drill, studying got a bit hard. Mary asks:
"Mommy, what are they doing?"
Panicked, her mother answers: "Cream puffs, they're making cream puffs!" and hurried Little Mary back home.
The second day, the mother took Mary to the zoo, to see all the caged wildlife! At the monkey cage, two of 'em started doing it, as nature wants. Some yells, some banana peels, children were glaring at the two primates. Mary asks:
"Mommy, what are the lil' monkeys doing?"
Again, her mother answers: "Cream puffs, they're making cream puffs!" and took her home right-away.
In the evening, sometime after dinner, lil' ol' Mary asks:
"Mommy, is it true that you and daddy made cream puffs?"
The mother was shocked, Mary understood what happened the past days, and muttered: "How did you know?"
"I licked the cream off the couch!"
