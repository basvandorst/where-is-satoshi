Dude, I have literally thousands of Satoshis. I don't want to be sloppy.
But in all seriousness, there has to be a way I can verify the legitimacy of a paper wallet generator for myself? Can I create my own?
@_date: 2019-07-23 16:31:10
I honestly think I'd feel safer with the coins on exchanges than on my phone.
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:45:15
Everyone spending BTC on Amazon won't drive the price up, it will just drive the fees up.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:01:29
What if I told you this "dip" was just a completely normal daily fluctuation?
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:29:37
The only way BTC won't hit 100k and beyond is if it hits zero imho.
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:58:43
I need a paper wallet. I'll get a hardware wallet soon, but I want my coins off of exchanges asap.
How can I generate one with absolute confidence that the source is legit and secure? 
I'll be generating the wallet on an air gapped PC and writing the keys down by hand (I don't trust my printer due to imternal HDD and network capabilities), but I feel pretty silly trusting an address generator from some random webpage. Is there a checksum hash or something that I can check? Is there any chance that these generators don't have sufficient entropy to be secure?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:15:31


Markets by their nature are easily manipulated by the rich few, to profit from everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:05
Ask yourself what makes bitcoin any better than the competition. I can't think of anything. 
The stupid thing is that there is a  solution (segwit), yet very few big players are adopting it.
Buying now is a gamble on Bitcoin catching up with the competition in terms of technology, before it gets left behind completely. Bitcoin could easily become the MySpace of the crypto world if changes aren't made very soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:35:51
No. There is a big difference between the price you can buy for on an exchange, and the price you can sell for. There are also fees associated with both deposits and withdrawals. If you deposited $20 and the price doubled, you would not be receiving $40 back.
It is not worth trying to make short term gains with small amounts. Either use it (lol) or HODL and completely forget about it for a year or two, 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:47:18
Why then, can nobody ever provide me with any of the evidence when I ask? Searching this sub doesn't help, every single thread today has a post just stating "BCash is a scam", I'm looking for a needle in a haystack.
You may not like the devs, but what makes it a "scam"?

Because it has risen too fast, and gained too much popularity too quickly.
Anyone with an ounce of sense saw this coming a mile away.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:11:01
Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:58:40
If everyone was using segwit, we wouldn't have a giant pile of unconfirmed transactions, and fees would be lower.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:40:44
Its flawed, but not a scam.
There are other cryptocurrencies which simply do the job better. The valuation never made sense.
Things would be different had the devs implemented periodic block size increases (as suggested by Satoshi), or had segwit been adopted on a large scale.
Bitcoin could still be valuable in the long term even if we see the crash of all crashes here, as solutions will (must) be implemented. Or, BTC may get left behind by the competition, nobody knows for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:37:01
Thanks, that's much better than the other charts I've been looking at.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:43
"Bitcoin" aren't selling Bitcoin to anyone though. They are being created by miners. There is nobody creating a shoddy product and trying to cash in on it.
People have been working on solutions to the flaws/scalability problems, but they have taken too long and Bitcoin got too popular too fast. 
Then there's the greed/hype aspect, and experienced traders exploiting unregulated markets.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:13:09
It's also tangible with other uses which give it value.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:56:26
I can't give an answer to this, it depends on too many factors which will vary from person to person.
My strat is to realise BTC gains and invest them elsewhere for diversity. I never want my crypto balance to account for more than 10% of my net worth, it's too volatile. Say BTC increased in value by a factor of 10 overnight, I'd reevalute my net worth, and sell enough BTC to bring my crypto assets back down to 10%.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:24:18
Why would you buy $15 of Bitcoin? There is literally nothing you can do with It at all, you won't even be able to send it to your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:05
Gold is tangible and has other uses which give it value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:01:01
I made a transaction a couple of days ago, just before the major congestion kicked in, the fee is 261 satoshis per byte.
How can I estimate how long it will take to get my first confirmation, or it it will even be picked up at all?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:09:33
Which is not what it's designed for.
If it's not a functioning currency, then it has no value to begin with. It is just one giant bubble reliant on more and more people buying in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:25
This is a HUGE issue and you should be able to sue the shit out of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:33:00
The past 48 hours prove my last 2  points.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:20:01
I tried to deposit some BTC to binance from another waller yesterday. I had no control over the fees. This is my first TX other than buying BTC with fiat.
The fee applied was 261 satoshis per byte, am I correct in thinking there is no chance this is will go through?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:59:22
Lightning network will never work. Think of the amount of fees it will cost just to make the transactions required to get it up and running on a large scale. It's a ridiculous "solution".
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:08
Don't tell them unless you plan on cashing out for fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:58
BTC is failing with no solution in sight any time soon, causing people to lose faith in crypto. 
Also, the valuation of all these cryptos was 90% speculation. Confidence falls, so does the price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:56:33
If you are investing such a small amount and hoping for a big payout in the long term, short term price fluctuations mean almost nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:32:29
I have criticised bitcoin a lot recently, but it's not a scam. Its ridiculous 17k+ valuation was just completely built on nothing but hype.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:53:54
Why do you think everyone who is having issues is a "shill"?
BTC is having serious problems at the moment, and many people are concerned. The fact that people on this sub just attack anyone who is having problems rather than actually explaining solutions doesn't help either. Stop pretending everyrhi g is fine, because it's really not.
Many noobs have buyers remorse. BTC feels like a scam to noobs who buy their BTC and then can't actually use it.
I've been waiting days for my tx's. Not had a single confirmation yet. It certainly doesn't feel like the currency of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:18:35
I'm not sure why this is relevant. I don't care what people call it. I find it easier to just use BTC and BCH to avoid confusion.
I'm not sure why you think "bitcoin" is reserved for anyone in particular though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:22
Gold is also used as a display of wealth, you can't put a price on human vanity/ego. Most commodities are traded at or close to their industrial value.
Where exactly do you think Bitcoin gets it's value from if it's not a functioning currency? 
Don't get me wrong, bitcoin is a great idea, but unless it works as a currency (which is supposed to be its primary function!), it is 100% worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:29:07
It makes sense they still use Bitcoin as part of the name, it's a fork.
"Scam" implies that everyone is going to have their money stolen. Your example is copyright infringement, not necessarily a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:09:44


And hire a compliance team, an anti money laundering officer, accountants, auditors, tax advisors, a web developer, a marketing team, directors, lawyers, plus the funds to actually setup all of the infrastructure.
Not so simple.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:09
Ì wish I hadn't originally fallen for all the propaganda / astroturfing in this subreddit.
I realised at the weekend that BTC is a sinking ship, tried to move my balance to an exchange to convert to alts, but shortly afterwards the network congestion ramped up, and my BTC has been stuck in limbo ever since. Knowing the amount of gains I would have made if I had made my tx an hour or two earlier really sucks.
I now think BCH is the *real* Bitcoin. Satoshi stated that block size should periodically increase, and BTC is already several years late on this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:20:02
I'm less concerned about the price, and more concerned with the fact that glaring flaws with the entire network are being exposed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:40:12
If you are investing, you should also have an exit strategy.
Everyone here will just say HODL, but there's not much point in accumulating lots of BTC (or any other asset) if you never use / spend / sell it.

The mentality in this sub is astounding. People like yourself seem to think Bitcoin is 100% flawless and 100% guaranteed to succeed. Finding fault with BTC here is like finding fault with Trump over at The_Donald. The 2 subs are very similar.

If you think buying BTC is pain in the ass, just wait until you try to make an actual transaction with It!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:51:59
Well the market is clearly wrong, which is why the price is tanking. People have been spending 1000s because they think it will make them a profit for no reason other than the hope that demand will increase and more people will want to buy in. Sounds not too dis-similar to a pyramid scheme right? 
As I've said several times, Bitcoin has value if it's a usable currency, but the past week has shown that it's currently not.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:10:15
Somewhere between $1 and $10,000 depending on what the market does today.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:11:01
Satoshi even stated that the block size should increase every (x) number of blocks. 
I don't understand why people think a rising block size is unnaceptable, but a rising mempool and fee size is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:13
You must have missed this part:


Commodities are either tangible, or backed by something tangible, and have uses which give them value. Bitcoin is not comparable to gold etc, It is not a commodity. I think it is *you* who doesn't understand.
BTC only works as a store of value if more and more fiat is pouring in, which is similar to how pyramid schemes work. It has no value at all if it's not a functioning currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:51:42
I'm not sure which would be slower at the moment, delivery or the BTC transaction.
Order now for next year.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:08:03
BTC goes on an unsustainable bull run and everybody on here thinks it's organic. BCH goes on a run and it's manipulation.
Regardless, BTC is the least usable cryptocurrency out of all of them at the moment. It's price and market domination are both completely unjustified.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:19:45
I thought the whole point of Bitcoin was to take control away from trillion dollar players? Not entice them.
This subreddit is in complete denial. Bitcoin is not good at doing what it is supposed to do. It's supposed be a p2p currency, not a token that you just hold onto forever in hopes of massive gains. Changes are needed asap.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:33:06
I was going to give BTC for Xmas, but I doubt any of my transactions will actually go through before the 25th at this rate.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:15:11
It's slower, and more expensive to use than all of its competitors, and it turns out it's easily attacked plus fees can  inflated by miners to boost profitability.

You shouldn't be worried that the BTC is lost, it's not.
What you should be worried about is that your BTC is going to become worthless because this week has shown that the network is fundamentally flawed and cannot cope with mass adoption.

I think most people are dumping because this week has shown that Bitcoin is the dinosaur of the cryptocurrency world, and there are no immediate plans to improve things.

It is a fork of the bitcoin blockchain. I don't think there is anything misleading about it being called bitcoin cash.
Nobody seems to have a problem with other forks using the bitcoin name, just BCH. Why do you think that is?
If someone buys bitcoin cash by mistake, it's their own fault.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:44:38
Because people here see BCH as a threat. Discussing BTC would mean acknowledging the massive problems it is currently facing. 
You should be aware that  both this sub and the poorly named r/BTC are massive circlejerks rife with astroturfing.  You are going to get 1-sided, biased opinions from both.

If it's just used as a "store of value" (LOL!), then it **is** a pyramid scheme (well, almost). The value is completely reliant on more and more people buying in.
If BTC is used as an actual currency, then it's not anything like a pyramid scheme.
At the very least, segwit needs mass adoption asap in order to make BTC a useable currency.

@_date: 2019-03-25 09:55:23
I really doubt that the current blocksize will remain forever. It will be increased one day, when multi petabyte hard drives are the norm, and bandwith is measure in terrabytes.

Other than LN, are there any other projects on the horizon to deal with scaling? LN is great and all, but I don't think its *the* solution to all scaling issues. I'm hoping to find some other projects to educate myself on.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:57:14
I was kinda hoping maybe there would be some kind of projects in the works to help the base chain scale, but being a semi-layman I don't know if thats even possible besides perhaps compressing the blocks somehow to allow effective blocksize increases without placing additional load on nodes.
Forks like BCH have opted for bigger blocks which kinda works in the short term  as a stop-gap solution, but it's not an *actual* solution for the long term IMHO. I saw ABC's roadmap includes achieving 1Tb blocks which is just pure madness, and exactly what people who were against the fork said would happen.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:42:09
I have, but I'm a long long way away from being useful to anybody haha.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:51:48
Its really not that straightforward  though.
If BTC/LN were adopted widely by retailers, BTC would likely struggle to handle the amount of TXs required just to open and close channels. LN also has it's own scaling issues, particularly for larger transactions.
LN is useful, but it's not *the* solution to widespread adoption (at least in its current form).
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:50:43
I'm waiting for 1 final purchase. Ive always had a target amount of BTC in mind for long term cold storage and have been trying to trade my way there.
If we continue to drop, it will be a better use of my time to just purchase my way there instead, then I can just forget about trading for a while, and occasionally buy more BTC to pay for my VPN, maybe trading a little with the change.
If we dont drop much further and this turns out to be the bottom, my current trades will pay off and I will reach my target eventually without having to make additional purchases.
Literally nothing will make me capitulate and change my BTC back to fiat. I'm not selling a single satoshi unless we go parabolic (upwards!) again.
@_date: 2018-12-19 16:59:31
Wtf is a poe-tah-toe?
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:14:59
I'll read up on MAST, I don't really know anything about it.
I disagree re: LN giving us enough headroom for the forseeable future, it wil help for sure, but with the price being so volatile, I expect there will be a lot of on-chain TXs as people convert to/from fiat. I feel like LN will be more helpful as BTC matures as an assset class and people feel safer leaving wealth in BTC.
I know I'm kind of asking for solutions to two seperate questions now - short to medium term scaling solutions, and the kind of solutions which would allow BTC to function as digital cash on a huge scale, not just as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:22:13
I will sell you a 5k bitcoin right now if you like?
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:33:29
Which is exactly why I'm asking if there are any other scaling solutions under development.
I don't know why so many of you feel like I'm attacking you or BTC by simply asking a question? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:05:50
That seems like an incredibly optimistic figure. I can't imagine multi-sig TXs account for much block size at all.
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:42:59
This would suck pretty bad. Imagine how expensive TXs would be if 1sat = $1.
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:34:25
People keep just saying "wrong", but why do you think BTC is so volatile? Its because its a niche market with relatively few players. If 25% of the population was using BTC, one guy selling his stack wouldn't cause a gigantic dump, and markets wouldn't be so easy to manipulate. 
I'm not "wrong", its just a catch 22 situation. Plus, none of your friends (or retailers) would lose fiat value if they knew how to hedge. 
Maybe I'm wrong about adoption being held back by scalability (although I do think this will be an issue if adoption speeds up more than development), but lack of adoption is the primary reason for the volatility.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:04:44
Have you found much about scaling beyond LN? Because that's pretty much only thing stopping me from acquiring more BTC right now and I can't find much about other scaling solutions in the works.
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:11:19
Adoption and liquidity will reduce volatility. Adoption is currently held back by scalability. 
Volatility will decrease in time as scaling solutions are developed (hopefully).
It's still usable for P2P with tx times being relatively low. The recipient of large TXs can always hedge short to ensure they do not lose out on any movements between the tx being submitted and processed. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:30:29
Scaling is of paramount importance to me long-term, because I would like to see BTC become the replacement for paypal eventually. Digital cash, not just digital gold, is how I envision mass adoption and true success of BTC.
For me and many others, BTC being as widely accepted as Visa would be the ultimate goal.
