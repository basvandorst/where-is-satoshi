Is anyone else having trouble buying coin on Cash app right now?
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:52:33
No it hasn’t. Everyone in this sub is delusional.. I’ll probably get banned for this comment.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:48:55

@_date: 2019-04-21 22:59:00

Thank you. I knew I was probably going to get downvoted for asking that but I appreciate you actually taking the time to answer.

So a whale is someone who holds a lot of BTC and sells all at once? Not really sure what your point is.

I bought some yesterday with my bank account on Coinbase.

Sorry, I thought that meant serious lol. I had it backwards..
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:01:23
Can someone please explain this to me. What is a whale and how do they affect the price? What is a dump?

I had it for a little bit but I sold all of my coin on there and started using Coinbase. How do you withdraw straight to your personal wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:41:40
I thought you meant you could take the actual BTC and put it in a personal BTC wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:32:20
Where do you get one of those?
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:17:39
Yeah, I think they should say that's what I'm betting. It's all a gamble.

If you haven't seen the documentary about him titled "Gringo", I highly recommend it. The guy is a psychopath murderer that is walking free in the United States right now... and yes, he did pay women to shit on his face through a hammock with a hole cut in it.
