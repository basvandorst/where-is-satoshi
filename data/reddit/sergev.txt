“For their fiat altcoin.” Getting pretty aggressive up in here.

This was super clever.

Oh gotcha. You’re totally right. Your title was not aggressive at all. Problem solved. Thank you for the clarification.

Kind of sucks since I owned GBTC when Bitcoin Cash was initially distributed to BTC owners but had since sold.  I incurred the risk as a shareholder but didn't garner the reward.

It’s also exponentially smaller. What is this trash?

It’s weird that they spell it Coin-base.

No you didn’t.

This was amazing.

Going in on one side isn’t 50% odds of winning. BTC has significant advantages in the form of ubiquity, market share, etc. I believe in hedging my bets but BTC has a much higher chance of winning against BCC. I also don’t believe that this is necessarily zero sum. There could be some utility for BCC where it retains its value.

Can someone explain what this means/implies?

"These charts look vaguely similar and there was an ETF created that has nothing to do with it.  IS HISTORY REPEATING??"

This should not be recommended.  Any number of things could happen that derail Bitcoin, both knowable and unknowable.  There are still so many risks ahead that need to be navigated.  I hope that most people are investing wisely and hedging with other investments.
