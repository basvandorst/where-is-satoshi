You're probably right actually...

Or maybe it's actually a pain in the ass for them to quickly and efficiently convert large amounts of bitcoin back into USD that they can actually use as a company?
Remember that virtually no companies besides that one metals exchange actually complete their transactions in BTC yet, they mostly just sell it at market price back to USD.

Uh silkroads devs fucked up and revealed the IP address.
Why are we so quick to jump to the defense of hard drug merchants? Because "muh NSA"?

Probably a combo of these.

what nobody seems to realize is that big banking and fees and things of that nature will not just magically go away if/when bitcoin or similar becomes the main currency. It will have to be dumbed down to be equally as simple (or simpler) than purchasing with fiat. The only way that will happen is through services/software which manage stuff for you. There will still be rich people who control lots of stuff, there will still be stocks, there will still be loans and credit. 
"same shit different day" is what i'm trying to get at here. Bitcoin will never become mainstream in the state it is in right now.

1. Drivers licenses prove you know how to operate a 2,000 pound 60mph hunk of metal without killing anybody
2. Gun licenses (WHEN DONE PROPERLY) prove you know how to operate a gun without getting you and the guys next to you at the range killed
3. Construction permits prove you're not hiring immigrants at $4.00/hr to build a balcony which will inevitably fall and fuck up the buildings next to it
4. Food service licenses prove you are running a restaurant that doesn't double as a rat motel

My plan is to sell BTC on an exchange site and then get USD. Not other way around or anything. Only my paypal and the website's money would be involved.

And really there isn't shit to do with bitcoins other than buy shady stuff and speculate/play financial games. We won't see a stable and high price until the consumer market adopts it meaningfully, which is a hard sell when bitcoin is so unstable and useless to the general public.

Figuring out how to pay less taxes while still being within the requirements of the tax code isn't illegal... "Gamey" but legal

You could always use darknet to purchase straight-from-factory PlayStations or something and resell if you want to cash out semi anonymously
