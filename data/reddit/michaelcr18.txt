@_date: 2018-05-08 08:14:30
Yes, all Im saying is that its the act of mining that reduces the supply, because of the act of buying (ie a transaction needs to take place), So its not the buying that reduces supply although it instigates mining

Just hodl relatively small amounts. Diversify to play safer, but decrease chances of bigger gains. Il hold for 45 days to see if ive made another 100 if I was you. Then take it from there. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:30:02
Unlikely though, if you look at the buy orders below say $2000 usd
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:30:47
That means youll be 40% up when its $6950

Its a fact that you wil be 40% up if you boight at 4950 and the price reaches 6950. Fact.

@_date: 2017-09-05 19:00:07
When you split your total into different currencies. For example $20 in bitcoin, $20 in eth, $20 in omg, $20 in ltc, $20 in iota. So if omg drops by 80%, then you only down 80% of one of those $20. If you had the whole $100 in omg and it drops 80%, then you lose 80% of the whole $100.. Works thenother way around for gains too
