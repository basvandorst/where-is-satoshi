I don't think it's any of your business what retailers do with the cash you give them. How would you expect them to prove this? Do you think you are entitled to examine someone's accounts, just because they make a product or service available for sale on the Internet?
Merchants who accept coin are taking a leap into the unknown in order to help build our community and the movement. All you are doing is making Bitcoin sound like a cult and a Ponzi scheme. Why don't you set up your own business, then convince all your suppliers to accept bitcoin?

No they won't. There are a lot of 'content creators' out there, and far more content than is needed. Content creators (other than creators of niche content, commercially useful content, or extremely reliable up-to-date reference data) are generally in competition for eyeballs for their free content.

Literally hundreds of millions of people 'create content' and share it for free without (hardly) any possibility of remuneration. This goes back to before any paywalls existed on the web. Are you aware of sites like YouTube, Facebook, Tumblr, WordPress? 
If everyone used AdBlock, all it would mean is that the 'contentrepreneurs', who mistakenly believe themselves to be the New York Times and their content to have monetary value would get off the web. Everyone else would keep on keeping on.

This is very doubtful. They are not trying to regulate you and almost certainly won't take out an arrest warrant for you, based on you transacting with someone who they regulate.

Why do 'users' expect website owners to provide content for free? Because it IS provided for free. No blogger is forced to blog at gunpoint. They do it because they want to, and most of them want people to read it.

The unpredictable value one isn't from a business perspective. It is from a fanboy / cult member / compulsive gambler perspective.
