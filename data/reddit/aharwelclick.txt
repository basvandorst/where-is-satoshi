Is it possible this crash is related to the spike last week and coinbases 3 to 5 day turnaround time for people that bought at its peak?
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:46:31
I have made purchases with LTC and BTC. It worked out very well. I can't do that with gold. 
I had the same argument as you untill I started using it for actual purchases instead of PayPal.
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:43:10
The government can't make gold (that I know of) and it still has universal value.

Always feel good to see green
@_date: 2018-09-06 22:33:30
Lol not true
@_date: 2018-09-26 13:57:18
I liked reading it but I don't really understand it completely.
if the specific to a certain coin or all of them?
@_date: 2018-09-06 23:50:02
That's true, it might all be over. But do a custom Google search, with search years in 2012,13,14,15  and search for Bitcoin is dead, each year the same thing happened.
All and all it all is speculation, and the chances of you being right are higher then me, but I still hold to my convection because if the price of eth or BTC went to 1 cent I and other people would buy as much as we could and then that would give it value and the cycle would start again.

No joke, that just made me Double Down TSLA.  Fucking Rockstar

Hey do you mind if I copy and paste this post into my replies on the BTC sub?
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:20:54
Didn't they take down a proud boys sub? 
I'm not worried about bitcoin.com I think most people don't trust urls anyway but Reddit sub BTC mislabeled is very fucking confusing for a lot of people.   This is bad for me in two ways since I own bch and BTC.
Do you know who I could contact that Reddit, I'll worry and taking care of the terms of service not being enforced.
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:24:58
Oh cool! I remember paper books!
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:38:51
for a crypto / tech bar that is pretty frggen cheesy.
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:04:52
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:42:29
I think it should be banned. That's like me making a sub called "Hillary Clinton" and making it all about Donald Trump.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:01:44
Best ta I ever seen
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:52:47
Wow.   This is informing I've been looking for.
I always thought thatht people on that sub didn't realize the damage they are doing by misrepresenting BTC as the wrong coin, now I know they do.
Is there anyway to report this entire sub to Reddit?
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:42:53
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:24:05
Ha, yeah
@_date: 2019-08-24 17:25:06
Or half a model s
@_date: 2019-08-19 01:03:18
That's cool, does seem like it's becoming more prevalent
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:35:27
Hmm , I thought mine was organic, that's weird. 
Is it possible the Reddits app bleeds in somehow?
@_date: 2019-08-21 00:35:50
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:13:10
Hmm, makes some sense. Still, doesn't seem right that they use the name BTC. There are definite TOS violations going on with that sub
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:24:10
This is fucking nuts
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:39:59
I'm asking a legitimate fucking question. Are you serious!?
instead of addressing the questions you're saying that my account is a burner account??
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:07:19
This IS the correction
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:18:25
I want someone to tell me logically why there is someone running a sub that is allowed to misrepresent, control  and manipulate at this level.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:38:51
In Jan 2018 when I bought in, I had no idea what I was doing, .finding a place to buy BTC was extremely hard, I honestly wasn't even sure if Bitcoin wasn't a scam.  Let alone every negative news story would effect the price..
Alllll of that has changed  plus the halving is in less then a year. My target is 190k.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:07:47
How do you make letters that big on a post??
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:05:14
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:21:25
When I first saw the drop today my first reaction was unhappiness, but then I remembered that I am not selling half until 100K, so it wouldn't even matter if we hit 20k or 4k this week. 
See you guys in a year
@_date: 2019-04-08 00:33:07
Interesting. But what does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-11 19:07:08
Interesting, funny looks like he's wrong just as much as right. Still, 50/50 odds would be pretty good
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:30:36
Yeah right? If anyone had a bot that worked, they prob wouldn't share
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:49:35
Fucking awesome
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:01:43
Unless you're getting wrong 95% of the time 50/50 is better
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:54:47

Contact your bank and ask them to reverse your transaction. Wells Fargo will pwn coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:20:22
Ha!!!!
