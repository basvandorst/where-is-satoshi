Societal catastrophe is going to happen anyway, the way we're going now. 
The rich are taking more and more while the middle class shrinks. That trend isn't going to change and we'll get more and more disenfranchised uneducated people as time goes on. We become less and less capable as a society. 
UBI gives us a chance to lift those uneducated poor up so that we can have a more organized transition.
Soon we'll have machines doing nearly all the work that the uneducated are qualified to do. The sooner we get on the transition the better.

That's not what happens though. The more developed and educated the population becomes the fewer kids they have until the population levels out. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:46:22
If we were going to vote for that why haven't we already? 
The people who pay taxes won't want to pay more of their hard earned money toward UBI than they have to.
If it's set up right you will always make more money by working than on UBI.

And those same traits will keep them working for more. But they'll have more freedom to do what they want. More freedom to take risks. 
And they will do so, so they can have a better car or bigger TV. Or a better life for their children.

I'm assuming you work to earn more money, do you not?
Why do most people work to earn more money when they can already afford a roof, food and clothes?
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:26:57
I agree, and that's exactly what I'd suggest.
Canada does Universal Healthcare at less than half the cost per person. We can too. There is enough money. 
*Edit* Added a sentence, corrected a word.

No. Just developed and educated. The US doesn't reproduce at a high enough rate to keep up the population. Nor do most first world countries.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:33
It doesn't cost any more than we're already spending as a nation on Healthcare and welfare. 
It cuts government waste significantly and allows for a more competitive environment because people will be more willing to take risk.
The only downside is the time it takes to transition the health care. Everything else is far more streamlined.

Why would anybody flee? There is no reason.
The UBI won't allow people not to work if they want to have any fun. And that's why the people currently working will continue to work. But they'll be less stressed out because they won't be trapped. They will be able to risk asking for a raise or better working conditions. Or more willing to change careers altogether. 
When people are able to afford a room and food they are more likely to be productive, as Salt Lake City found out when they saved money by giving the homeless apartments. 
So we'll have far less of a homeless and poor problem which will significantly reduce crime rates.

I don't think it has anything to do with IQ. 
Population growth happens because people feel the need to have as many children as possible due to high child mortality rates and other dangers that may cause all of their children to die prematurely.
The population begins leveling off as soon as the adults feels secure in their old age. They no longer need to have 10 children to care for them after they are too old to work. They have enough children to pass on their genes and move on.
UBI wont have much of an impact on the US population, other than immigrants will have more incentive to come here legally. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:22
We already spend enough on Healthcare and other welfare to fully fund UBI including universal health care. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:32:25
We're already paying the money. I'm not suggesting raising taxes on anybody.

&lt;sigh&gt; Take your up-vote and stop picking on the elderly....

Not sure how I feel about being called part of the "older" generation...

It won't hit $1000 again. Everybody will rush back in if it goes below $5k.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:59:10
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:58:40
When it's still a 500% gain... Yeah. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:15:13
Yeah if you invested early 2017, then sold at 15-20k, $5k would be a pretty tempting time to get back in.
This isn't different than any other peak or valley we've seen with Bitcoin.

It is life changing money for a vast majority of the world. Including most people in the US (at least potentially).
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:32:45
So you think 19 antisemitic people who hated America chose to die so America could cover up where some money went?
Or did they do it to help the Jewish owner of the buildings collect on the insurance?
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:35:06
Yes, yes it was!

No. The literal planet...

Well a big one in the right direction could fry the whole planet... So...
