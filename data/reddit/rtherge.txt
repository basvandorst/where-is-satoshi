My understanding is that they will just make it a legal requirement to do AML/KYC which every exchange is already doing anyway. I guess it might affect the ability to do small trades without? and might also affect some localbitcoins traders, but that's probably about it.

might be possible in combination with transferwise;  -- or if not then some other service.. or paypal to withdraw back to the attached card might also be faster.. on the other hand, SEPA instant payments are being implemented this year.. won't happen everywhere at once, but I guess if revolut and fidor support it it would help a lot. 
edit: actually I guess transferwise support is only for paying transferwise, not for them paying you.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:53:23
No. It's not possible to make an LN transaction without segwit, but that's fine. Everyone making LN payments is going to use segwit. What isn't necessary is to get anyone not making LN payments to use segwit. Segwit is already deployed from a network perspective, anyone can make LN and segwit transactions already. LN clients will make segwit LN transactions, since there is no other way to make them. It isn't necessary to chase non-LN users to upgrade to segwit.

You could try bunq.com - they have access to the netherlands payment system (iDeal), so you could use  or  to get instant purchases. I guess that doesn't really solve the problem as you still need to SEPA funds into bunq.. maybe once they enable debit card top-ups it'd work.

No it isn't correct. The P2SH wrapped segwit will just be a segwit when it's redeemed and the actual script is revealed.. so no, segwits are not ever malleable.
More relevant.. the funding transaction for a LN channel could not be a P2SH wrapped P2WPKH.. as there would be no way to know that it actually was a segwit tx.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:14:27
this is very confusing
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:15:08
I guess they don't want to rely on exchanges doing it voluntarily or because their banks make them do it. And also to formalise the specifics of how it's implemented.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:06:42
let's hope he does :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:18:23
hmm ok.. so those must also be excluded from the possibility of LN channel funding.
edit: actually not really.. as the channel will be fine once it's confirmed on chain, it can't really be malled at that point.. and any payments inside the channel will reference this confirmed/already mined/non mallable segwit tx.

capital gains/loss is realised when you sell the BTC and is calculated vs the price you bought the BTC. It doesn't matter where the BTC is being held or was held (ie, in coinbase or otherwise). You can deposit and withdraw BTC all day long and it makes no difference to anything. Similarly it makes no difference if you have USD in coinbase or in a bank or in cash.. it's all just USD.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:08:55
heat pumps are more efficient than a traditional resistive load, so there's still an argument there.. I think the best thing that can happen with mining is to advance new energy production tech such as solar panels and perhaps cold fusion by providing an easy to deploy and profitable load. Humanity can then benefit by the energy production tech coming down in cost and cheaper consumer electricity prices. Basically if bitcoin needs electricity at say 4c/kWh and people start building new energy production to deliver power at that price for bitcoin mining, then it should result in lower electricity costs for everyone already paying more than 4c/kWh. You might say why don't people just do that already for the higher price consumers.. and the reason is that it's a highly regulated industry. If you can just slap a homebrew generator on some remote farmland and some bitcoin mining rigs next too it you don't even need to inform anyone much less comply with any regulations.. so it should be good for innovation.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:11:56
exchanges adopting onchain segwit isn't a step towards them adopting LN. onchain segwit adoption is kindof irrelevant.. what matters is when major exchanges will start rolling out LN.. 100% of LN transactions will be segwit from day 1.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:59:12
It's not possible to make an LN transaction that doesn't use segwit payment channels, but you're going to be making these kinds of transactions using a LN client, and LN clients will use segwit payment channels.. so as soon as people start making LN transactions, they will be segwit. Non-LN segwit transactions aren't important IMO. There's already a fee incentive to use them, but harassing exchanges to implement non-LN segwit won't help LN in any way.

I think what will happen is that prices will be set in BTC, shops will accept BTC via LN, but customers will fund the purchases using other cryptocurrencies like LTC, maybe BCH  and also - via BTC denominated custodial bank accounts where they do not have access to their keys.. for example revolut - which does not currenly allow customers to withdraw other than by selling back to them might one day allow purchases over LN.

tbh I'm not sure.. maybe in theory it should cost 2x as much since it's two transactions and it also depends on the size of both transactions in the first place. I suspect 490 would ensure that they both eventually confirm, but perhaps not in the next block.. err also remember it's 490 per byte, not per tx.. maybe try a 200k satoshi fee.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:05:49
It's not a ridiculous offer, but it's probably worth at least 2x that now and really by the time the funds are actually released it could be much more. If you need the money now, then sure.. if you'd just hodl the btc anyway, might as well let mtgox do it for you.

I guess they might be trading using coinbase custody or something.. tbh I think it's quite unlikely that OTC is much larger than exchange volumes.. mainly because who would be the seller? It might be some dealer that then tries to buy on the exchange slowly without spiking the market, but in that case the traffic still feeds through to the exchanges anyway.. for OTC to be larger there need to be large sellers that aren't just market making, and I don't think there are any.

Honestly the best way is probably not to use BTC.. if they're just going to turn around and sell it immediately anyway you're just going to lose money on fees.. something like transferwise or paypal would be better.

china has a lot of electric vehicles.. from random home made tricycle contraptions, to basically every kind of motorcycle and scooter being electric and some electric cars and vans. they also make all the solar panels. also climate change is really just about managing oil depletion, instead of oil going to $1000 to limit demand and saudi arabia getting even richer the governments of oil consuming countries would rather impose large import taxes so that oil still costs $1000/barrel to limit demand, but most of the cost is now in taxes that can be diverted into various "environmental" projects in the country rather than money going out of the country towards oil producers. china is also an oil consumer and so they will probably have no issue getting on board with that agenda too... although they might not necessarily use the same propaganda as we're subjected too by our own governments.

Ln will work across blockchains. I suspect that small value holders will migrate to litecoin or some other blockchain (still paying for things in BTC a lot of the time, but holding LTC).. also probably the vast majority of users will just use bitcoin banks like coinbase and not bother taking control of any keys.

If it's the credit aspect you're interested in, I recommend using revolut.. top it up using your cc and then send it to coinbase or bitstamp by sepa transfer. Alternatives are transferwise send from credit card to fire.com or bunq.com (or any other EUR bank account). The revolut way may not incur any fees at all depending on your card. transferwise has a 1.7% fee for credit cards and I guess you'll also pay roughly 0.5% to convert to euro, but still way cheaper than any direct cc-&gt; exchange method.

I don't know about swizterland in particular, but in general the coins you buy to resell would be taxed on the markup as income.. so say you buy them at $3500 and sell them immediately for $3600 you've made $100 in income and that would be taxed at whatever your current income tax rate band is. If you sell them to friends at cost making no markup then that should not be taxable.
If you sell btc that you bought for yourself and held then that would be capital gains, which is taxed separately from income. How long you have to hold before it becomes capital gains rather than income is probably a grey area.

The alternative is to trade in EUR on kraken, bitstamp or gdax (or some other EUR exchange). You can do so by opening an account with fire.com which gives you both GBP faster payments and an EUR IBAN  account. You can also use revolut to convert GBP to EUR for essentially no cost. Another option is to use fidorbank.uk who will accept GBP and convert/send it to EUR for £2.49. fidorbank is less steps, but it only works in the sending direction.. you can't receive EUR back again. I would suggest opening accounts with fire, revolut and fidor and also with kraken and bitstamp and maybe gdax as well.. it's all mostly the same paperwork.

I'm not sure it counts as spoofing if you can trade against them.. if someone puts up a large sell order someone else can buy it all and they won't have time to retract it.. so it's a real sell.. spoofing is more when there's something about the platform that allows people to make an offer and then reneg on it without executing.

I'm going to say no, because offchain means there's nothing in the blockchain to analyse.. now it will be the same privacy if you didn't swap currencies.. ie, just btc to btc payments are also offchain and thus not subject to blockchain analysis.. on the other hand, there are probably still ways of tracking stuff.. and as always the 5 eyes security dragnet will see everything and may drop hints so law enforcement agencies can parallel construct a reason to take down evildoers.
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:12:12
try fidorbank.uk, or fire.com. fire.com is arguably better since you can also use it to withdraw as well as deposit while fidorbank can only send SEPA payments. If you're impatient, there's likely nothing stopping you depositing from your bank account directly to kraken's EUR account, it's just that your bank will charge some fx fees and a transfer fee. Also, you can send GBP to kraken's Japan bank which may work efficiently for large amounts.. like £10k or more.. but due to the likely high transfer fee may not be worth it for lower sized transactions.

basically it just makes it hard to find the transaction because it confirms under a different txid than you're expecting.. you can still find it by looking at the inputs and seeing what tx spent them, but that's difficult to index. the btc doesn't get lost.

exchange -&gt; fire -&gt; revolut -&gt; yourbank is very cost effective. I think kraken and bitstamp charges 0.90EUR to withdraw.. gdax charges 0.15EUR, fire has no tx fees on EUR transfers and revolut has extremely low fx rates.. so the process is quite efficient. It remains to be seen if you can withdraw directly to revolut now that they also have GB IBANs (note, this hasn't been possible up till now which is why fire is needed).. it won't make the process any more efficient financially (since fire charges no tx fee), but it would save one step.

not really.. all bitcoin nodes now have segwit locked in.. if miners don't enforce the rules that is the same as them hard forking to a broken altcoin.

Yes, there are probably a bunch of people doing this.. not entirely clear if that's how these projects work, but it probably is;   
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:15:42
that isn't why they do it. it's purely to link addresses that are part of the same wallet (owned by the same entity) for analysis/tracking purposes.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:27:07
Basically you're only supposed to use bitcoin addresses once. So, once the address has been spent once, it should never be used in any other transaction. By refilling the address after it's spent, it now has some balance again and will be selected by the wallet coin selection to be part of a new transaction again.. this time probably involving other addresses that are part of the same wallet (but that weren't involved in the first transaction that emptied that address).
Also you don't have to wait for the bitcoin address to be 'empty' because it's not really the addresses that get spent but UTXOs.. two UTXOs at the same address will probably not be spent at the same time, so it has the same effect without having to wait for the address to be emptied before dusting it.

He reveals it by unlocking/spending/claiming the payer's UTXO that was locked with the hash. The cleartext key becomes part of that unlocking/spending transaction which is broadcast to the entire p2p network and gets included in a block for all (including the payer) to see.
@_date: 2019-10-31 10:26:46

colored coins are kindof an outdated way of doing asset tokens.. to answer your question though, I guess you'd just have to make sure you don't mix that special satoshi with non-special ones.

adoption by major exchanges
@_date: 2019-02-06 16:23:32
the leaked info suggests no such thing
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:45:31
You will use multiple UTXOs in a transaction, but you won't use them all in one transaction (probably). Dusting just relates other transactions back to the address used in a previous transaction that wouldn't otherwise (necessarily) be connected with it. 
It's probabilistic.
It might not help them.. for instance, if you make a transaction that just consolidates the dust UTXO with the main UTXO and then spend that combined UTXO as a transaction, it doesn't reveal any new information to the attacker.. but if you spend the two separately in two different transactions - involving different sets of other addresses in your wallet - then those sets of addresses are now obviously part of the same wallet, when otherwise they wouldn't have been connectable.

Well if they don't reveal it, they won't get paid.. they won't be able to spend the funds with their channel partner to fund an outgoing offchain payment.

bitstamp.net works with revolut. kraken is also good, but doesn't work with revolut (banned for some unknown reason).. you can use some other eur account like  instead of revolut in the same manner though.
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:59:02
well it depends who you're wanting to pay.. they'll probably be well connected to businesses that accept btc but want to exchange it for fiat.. because those businesses will likely be their clients.
In the context of this thread where the OP is basically suggesting that LN might be a way to offload tainted BTC on unsuspecting channel partners.. well I think that probably won't fly in the long term.. some parties will be very choosy about who they accept as partners precisely because they don't want to receive stolen btc from some unaccountable anonymous 3rd party.. maybe some people really won't care.. we've seen altcoin exchanges like btc-e and maybe shapeshift that allowed anonymous exchange, but neither of those now do that either.
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:37:43
from the narrow point of view of tainted btc, the only thing that matters is their immediate channel partners, not the payment originator or even the end recipient.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:36:32

BTC only move in bilateral payment channels.. your payment channel partner needs to accept you and your BTC. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:16:23
nodes will accept fork blocks.. that is to say blocks that are linked using prev_hash to a block that already has blocks built on top of it.. they won't consider the fork chain valid if/until it has the most work, but they will store it in case in the future it does turn into the valid chain.. so to propose a fake/fork chain all you need to do is start broadcasting your fork blocks.
@_date: 2019-02-07 09:21:44
*if* they accept to create a channel with you. I think it's likely that in the future you won't just be able to open a direct channel with anyone you want.. a worst case you might be basically forced to open one with a kyc'd exchange.
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:43:52
I guess you're using mycelium locks? I don't really know how that works, I'm afraid.. but I guess that the address you're sending too isn't actually an address you control, but one that coinapult controls.. in which case, you wouldn't be able to CPFP it unfortunately.. I might be wrong tho.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:30:36
Once we have LN and micropayments the transaction volume will absolutely skyrocket... but onchain tx cannot grow much from where it is now. 
Another thing to consider is that a lot of the onchain transactions may be spam. It could be that there is growth of non-spam high fee paying (ie, real) transactions happening inside the overall 300K.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:53:06
 Coinbase does not accept GBP other than by visa/mastercard (with 4% fee).
They accept EUR via SEPA transfer, which indeed any bank can send (just look for international bank transfer in online banking), however most charge a £10-25 fee + a 2.5% fx spread to do that.
[Revolut]( seems like the best solution at the moment.. they give you both a GBP and an EUR account with their own account numbers. The EUR account needs to be activated inside the app once you are signed up. Once you have the EUR account you can send transfers to coinbase in EUR. Revolut charges nothing to convert GBP to EUR and also no fee to send EUR.

well let's say that I expect at least some channel partners will want to do kyc.. like probably the existing bitcoin exchanges will offer their customers payment channels - but they'll be tied to your account.
maybe there will be enough alternative partners who don't care that it doesn't matter.. but they might not be as well connected as say the large kyc'ing exchanges.. time will tell.

They really are having 1000 instances.. it's a great way for them to market bluemix as lots of large companies aren't allowed to deploy internet connected blockchain stuff internally anyway, and everything is currently at a PoC stage so no real integration is required. I do agree with you that it doesn't seem to make a huge amount of sense once everything is in production.. but IBM are making good money off their bluemix stuff right now (as well as just getting people to try it out.. might lead to unrelated apps being deployed there too once their account managers are embedded), so it was probably a savvy business decision.
I think it makes sense to think of blockchain type systems more like a replacement for a REST API -- one where the permissioning is managed in a less centralized way or perhaps rather where the same organisational identity can be permissioned by various other orgs without having to make new usernames and passwords, and using strong cryptographic signatures for authentication. It may be a good way to hook up a lot of different organizations using some rough common standards.
The trade finance thing is something where a large number of different kinds of organisations might want to talk to each other, so it's probably a good use case to try this out.

You pay the gains as they are 'realized'.. so if you buy a classic car with bitcoin that was bought a while ago, then however much the btc is worth when you use it to buy the car minus whatever you paid to acquire it would be taxed for CGT..

You can use revolut.com or another EUR account provider such as fire.com or bunq.com or fidorbank.uk (not an EUR account, but allows cheap fx/EUR transfers) to send funds to kraken.com, bitstamp.net or coinbase/gdax. This is the cheapest way as there aren't really any GBP exchanges aside from p2p ones like localbitcoins which attract a price premium.
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:02:01
Not really.. there's no standard way to send messages and most wallets wouldn't display them anyway. I think you can make a transaction that only produces a 0 value UTXO - if that's what you're really asking, but it still needs to spend money to pay the fee.
@_date: 2019-09-18 10:24:01


Not so sure about that.. since it can be immediately copied. There are already suitable cards available; 
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:35:50
The process is just as lengthy, but there's gemini.com and itbit.com and kraken.com too.
@_date: 2018-07-04 12:43:26
yes, they're called bitcoin exchanges.

The seed is basically the private key.. it's mutated into multiple private keys by adding adding extra stuff to the seed/original private key.. eg: function getKey(seed, x) = sha256(seed + x) (for a crude example -- but not what's actually used). You then generate public keys from each of the derived private keys and check the blance of them.. I think wallets usually check up to 20 or so public keys after the last one that had a balance in case you skipped a few.

If core merged it, it doesn't stop it being a HF.. it just means they would be participating in the HF. 
The new software would still be incompatible with the old, and for sure some people would still be running the old versions. I also think it's likely that updates compatible with the old version would continue to be produced by someone even if core stopped.

kraken has a [USD to USDT]( trading pair, and allows USD domestic deposits.

might still be possible through some non EEA issuer banks.

you mean embed a message in a bitcoin transaction? you have to pay a fee for every transaction.

what about that &gt;100kBTC tx that happened the day the warehouse opened?

Not really.. someone could connect to all the nodes at once and send one transaction (coffee pay) to 50% and one transaction (self refund) to the other 50%.. just keep doing that a few times and you're guaranteed to get a free coffee 50% of the time.

It's a shame the ledger unplugged was discontinued.. without a screen, it isn't as good security, but it's just another credit card.. maybe the concept can be revived with these new e-ink cards.

strange given that Iran has virtually no external debt.. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:52:37
regardless. Most people don't have much to say to each other.. the long tail of people you occasionally contact is useful, but also costly to maintain... often people lose contact because they are not on the same social media platform.. ie, the relationship wasn't worth the minimal effort of using something else.
I think it's likely that people will have even less reason to pay each other.
@_date: 2018-04-16 16:08:14
eh. that's hardly a Chilean issue.. if people in the US or Europe actually though suing the banks was possible, they'd have been doing it for the last 8 years.. but everyone here knows you'd just be throwing away money on lawyers.

I dunno. he's probably right.. and it probably applies even more with buying/selling.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:47:58
it's most used in the usa and maybe other english speaking countries like canada, and the uk.. with a largeish following in china (but small in comparison to the general population).. the articles about it being used in venezuela and zimbabwe are basically bullshit. sure there are some people doing stuff there, but you're probably talking about hundreds, not thousands of them.

if someone is dumb enough to pay $16,5k for a generic domain, let um. The interesting thing is that it seems to be forsale, so maybe whoever bought it is hoping to sell it to a bigger fool.. I'm also curious, did you buy it new? or did you also buy it from someone else? It's interesting to me that people are flipping domains that will probably never be used for running any kind of business.

This isn't mtgox related.

Basically because no banks have implemented it yet.. they sure will though once it's possible. Imo it probably isn't a game changer.. it's free for europeans to transfer from their banks to exchanges already, it's just a minor user experience improvement (although even that is questionable - some people will still prefer to initiate the transfer from the bank side).
@_date: 2018-07-23 14:09:39
this is pretty cool
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:40:09
The banks have until the end of the year to implement it, and many of them are going to take a fine for not doing it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:21:36
not if they have any sense

Getting a bank account closed is a real (but fairly low) risk.. but it's still usually free to open a new one.. if you're really risk adverse, open the new account preemptively and use it for the btc transactions.

One advantage with the cash settled futures is that if you go short, you don't have to buy back any BTC to cover at the end. This is useful because it probably wouldn't be possible to buy back a large amount of BTC without massively spiking the price.. so you can short all month long, and then at futures expiration, you have maybe made some money, maybe lost some money.. but ultimately you don't have to buy back any BTC.. if all the people who bought your (short) futures took their cash and tried to buy BTC, they won't be able to. The existence of the cash futures may also divert buying from real BTC exchanges too.. for instance if you price the futures slightly cheaper than spot, many buyers may take it.. because it's a rational thing to do if they don't need immediate delivery.. but by not buying at spot, there's now less buy pressure on the spot markets and the price can go down.. so yea basically they can sell futures all month long, which diverts money from spot and ultimately can lower the price.. and then when the settlement is due, they just owe cash at the current spot rate and dont have to really deliver the BTC which they wouldn't be able too.

Bitcoin is very traceable.. and almost all the centralised bitcoin services are hosted behind cloudflare, which allows them to monitor everything anyone does on those platforms and easily link them together through the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:26:32
They probably just accept 0 confs, ie without waiting for the transaction to be included in a block.

The one you see is just the next empty address in your wallet.. you're not supposed to use an address more than once, so it always shows you a new one. The old addresses should all still be there, and when you spend money it will spend from them. It doesn't spend from whatever address it's showing since that is the next empty address - with no funds on it yet.
