This is exactly like Paranormal activity mentioning "This is a real story..." in the first scene and at the end "This is not a real story..." . 
Well, FU too OP. :|

Coinbase and Bitstamp are not even bothered by this. I think somebody needs to tweet it to them
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:09:54
Slow poke.

I didn't mean to be rude to the OP. But, in the middle of the high time with Two_bit_idiot releasing that Mt.Gox faked the acquisitions - it is fairly maddening to see someone posting a rant without reading the other posts - where even the journalist from wired didn't get any response.

If Gox.com doesn't happen, a lot of people lose a lot of money. What would you rather have?
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:59:38
Whats your email?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:14:10
Yes, because losing my money to Gox is not good enough.

This is not what was needed because I already mentioned that I trust their systems. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:21:05
How do you start? 
You don't.

@_date: 2014-02-26 21:40:56
It looks like that!
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:48:04
Can you expand and explain this a bit?
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:07:19
Ron? Ron... Swanson?

What do you mean by this? As in, is okpay returning the money that you have deposited using that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:41:27
I love your optimism. But deleting your twitter feeds to implementing a fix is sooo 90's.

Heh! You're from The Netherlands! (to myself: Thank you sherlock!)

I am a pretty good programmer and I'm interested. Just to understand your concept, if I am a user - what will I see? How will I buy BTC with USD on my credit card (how will the money move) and How can I sell them for USD ?
