I think the main reason is because with bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions become even simpler playa , with Bitcoin payments happen instantly so the funds are in my account available for my use as soon as I receive the payment. There is no waiting or settlement period, so it stands to improve the business cash flow and bookkeeping. The moment I receive bitcoin from a customer, the digital transfer of value is immediate and final, without the risk of chargebacks sitting on our books

Hey everybody, I just saw this post thanks to a friend and mentor who send it to me. The taco stand you see here is accepting bitcoin and yes we do accept debit and credit cards just that the merchant system was down last night which is why we weren't accepting debit or credit cards. Soon we will accept Monero, Dash, Ripple, Stellar Lumens, Litecoin, Ark, Ethereum, Neo and DogeCoin I am just waiting upon the arrival of my ledger nano since Trezor doesn't accept most alt coins. Bitcoin for the moment is accepted, I use my personal hardware wallet (Trezor) or my blockchain wallet to receive payments. Now for all you who are complaining about the fees and if you use Coinbase; yes fees will be high you can instead use GDAx that only charges 0.30% compared to Coinbase which charges 1.5% or through your blockchain/ Trezor wallet. Fridays and Saturdays we are open until 3:30 a.m, we set up outside on the parking lot with good music jamming bringing a good vibe to our customers. Our tortillas are freshly handmade, and we also have beer all night long just ask for a small coffee on ice (thats the secret code) Swing on by we are located on 825 E. Mission Blvd, Pomona CA next to 711. Here is our website
