USD is not backed by gold. There you go. Argument crushed.

It's hilarious watching r/btc find any reason they can to denounce bitcoin. Go take a look at their sub. Post after post of them jerking each other off over bitcoin perceived shortcomings. All total bollocks, of course.
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:20:02
Ya know. I don't think we should even give Roger and BCH the time of day. Their like a little buzzy fly buzzing around our head. They're so insignificant we shouldn't be paying them any attention what-so-ever. r/btc love it when we stress and worry about them. Funny as this, let's just ignore them and concentrate on making Bitcoin the best it can be.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:05:23
That might technically be the case but HRMC are not going to chase me for the CGT I owe on the purchase of my Trezor (I paid in BTC). They got 20% VAT on it anyway.....
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:09:21
OK I must be a moron. I read the whole thing, every page. I can't see where in that link it says that I owe tax on the appreciation of an assets (BTC's) value even if it is not sold/converted to GBP.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:24:21
That's what I don't understand. Bitcoin is divisible. So why would I ever over pay...? Sorry if I'm being a dummy. Just trying to understand.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:21:41
They're throwing money away....
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:34:37
Could you expand on that? Why would their be a remainder? Wouldn't they send the exact amount I've withdrawn plus fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:35:58
US tax law seems awfully complicated. 
In the UK we are only liable for taxes on Bitcoin when we convert it back into GBP. So while I hold my BTC and it increases in value it is only taxable against my personal allowance when I withdraw it into my bank account.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:39:19
I understand. Thanks for helping me get there. ��
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:27:57
If two outputs is a batch then I guess so.... but I assume that the second output is the miner fee? I'm not really well versed in how this all works....
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:14:41
Sorry you got scammed but honestly, how dumb are you? 
Use this as a lesson. Don't buy things from strangers on Reddit.....
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:15:43
Thanks for that.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:53:33
The whole idea of a hardware wallet is that you can plug it into any computer without fear.....
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:01:45
As I said we only pay tax when we convert to GBP. From the OP comment it seems that you have to pay tax when the value of the crypto increases. Did I misinterpret that?
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:32:42
Of course it's the beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:46:16
GDAX. First word in the title.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:37:47
I'd think that's very unlikely... HMRC are wildly incompetent. ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:02:12
Oh I didn't know that. Thanks for the clarification, buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:50:55
This can't be right. Lightning network is dead. r/BTC told me so.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:25:08
Thanks for clearing that up mate. 
I doubt HMRC are going to chase / audit me for the CGT on my Trezor purchase. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:07:09
Probably some folks from r/btc
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:09:54
Well that seems a bit silly to be honest. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:22:03
Buying a Pi and all the gear because of this guide. Cheers dude
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:59:38
So you've worked out how to tell when it reaches the bottom and will start to rise? Are you going to share this information?
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:45:56
 
I'm being honest. Most here are not, I feel.
Having said that, I am in it for the tech also bit that comes secondary to profits for me. I mean, my wife and I live month to month, both work full time and don't own own own house. I see this as my one chance to actually make some decent money and perhaps maybe one day be able to buy a property to secure my retirement and pass to my.chilsfrn when I pop it.

Just emailed Mycelium app Dev to request Segwit compatibility.
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:28:30
Why on earth would this comment be worthy of a down vote?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:33:30
You should give bittylicous a try. UK based. They connect users looking to buy and sell.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:17:40
I must be blind because I still can't see it.....
Unless you mean 'swapping it for something else' 
In which case I guess you're right. Although that's not something I'll be doing. So for me, I will only owe the tax when I sell for GBP.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:17:26
Ask r/btc
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:27:22
I'm not getting into a tit for tat argument with a stranger over the internet. 
I've made my decision and so have you. Let's just leave it at that, k?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:45:15
Sorry dude but he correct. Your entire post is FUD
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:03:16
I'll be honest. I didn't read past 'Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit when you sell (or ‘dispose of’) something (an ‘asset’) that’s increased in value.'
I must not be understanding correctly but it the way it reads to me is that we I it have to pay tax to HMRC when we sell our crypto for GBP.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:35:32
Doesn't stop the morons over at r/btc jerking each other off over Bitcoins decreasing market share. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:36:17
Yeah it's £11,300
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:04:48
You know the answer. Its the same reason you have some. To make money.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:33:25
Ahhh. Right. Thanks for the explanation, buddy.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:22:15
Well I work full time and earn more than the personal allowance per year so technically I owe CGT for the Trezor.
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:46:36
Nothing we learn in school in the UK really helps us in the real world. Well at least that was true when I was at school, I left in 2000 though, so obviously things could have changed significantly.
Yes it's a cheesy song but he makes some good points.

Fantastic. Thanks.

You have to actually add the /s or people think you're being serious....
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:21:01
I have the facilities to run a node. Should I? What do I gain? What does the network gain? Cheers guys.

You need to define 'soon'.

No he's not but his post is dripping with bias.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:38:13
This is excellent. Any chance of adding GBP?
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:26:50
I have a spare Pi. I could do this. What are the reason I should? How does it help the network? Does it help me? Cheers.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:10:34
Three including me.

Trezor arrives tomorrow.... Currently they're on a wallet on my PC
