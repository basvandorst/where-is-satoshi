Banks don’t send out 1099s for random deposits into my account.  If I cashed out 2 million a red flag probably would arise.  But banks don’t report to the IRS.  The IRS can pull my bank statement.  
But as far as I’m aware the banks only issue out statements for interest gained which would be reported.
Edit: Added
“The Bank Secrecy Act requires banks to report cash transactions over $10,000 to the IRS. ... That means that the bank isn't going to alert the IRS if you transfer $11,000 from your checking to your savings or deposit a $11,000 check. However, it will alert the IRS if you make that $11,000 deposit in cash.”

Why would coinbase stop paying the fees but not GDAX?  I’m looking on their site and I can’t find anything that confirms that or Denys that.  I will test it out myself I guess and see 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:23:27
Why would you move it to GDAX first...There is no additional fee from coinbase to outside wallet.  It makes no difference if it’s coinbase or GDAX, the transfer fee is bitcoins cost to pay the miners.  It has nothing to do with the coinbase company

Why the fuck does everyone think an ETF denial is going to have that much pullback.... the ETF has been pending for 4 years..... the money's that's in it isn't because we've been waiting for an ETF approval for that time.  
China Froze withdrawals for all major exchanges and pull back was only 10% FOR TWO DAYS..... a pending 4 year ETF is not really a issue.... iI see MAYBE a pullback to 1015-1020.  
There's a lot of upside for the ETF approval and not really that much downside for the denial.  BTC has been going just fine with out the ETF

If you move your "Coins" off the exchange how possibly can they know how many coins you have.
And also since you don't own the coins that are in the Coinbase account and all you own is a promise.... how legally can they make you pay taxes on a promise?

This is a great article for those like me wondering if bitcoin is going to fail from lack of scaling.  
Semi noob question.   As bitcoin goes up in price doesn't it scale itself to a small extent.  (I know the numbers are incorrect but as an example) if I wanted to send 1000 USD to someone and bitcoin was at 1 USD (for purposes of this example 1 bitcoin equals a byte) i would need to take up 1000 bytes on the blockchain where as if a bitcoin equals 1000 usd then I only need to use 1 byte?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:27:36
Hope they do nothing 
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:15:11
Only issue I have with them is the week long wait if I do a direct bank deposit.... my limit there is 15000 a week and my credit card just got to 500 today.  I hate waiting a week for the funds to clear and then have them deposit.... but not entirely their fault... tho after over  10k purchases I feel like I should have some credit 
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:47:35
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:47:13
It could cost you money.  You could buy today on Coinbase for let's say 1200 plus a 3% fee and you have "the coins" today.  Or you can deposit on gdax thru a direct withdrawal from your account and it takes 5-7 days to process... say in the time frame the price goes to 1300.... you "saved" money by not paying a fee but you got less bitcoins.... so really you lose... 
My opinion is if your looking to invest... there is no better time than now.  I had a friend who said he wanted to get into bitcoin after I talked to him about it at 600... he kept waiting for the price to drop.... he finally stoped waiting at 1037..... cost him almost double his money to get one coin....

Bitcoin is what the car industry did when the model T came out or when the Internet arrived... the world has discovered this amazing tech and it won't be put away ever again, every extra penny I can spare penny goes into BTC.  Just to be part of a chapter in history that will forever change the world is exciting.
I don't personally believe in a % based portfolio if you are actively watching your investments.  I don't see the point investing or reallocating funds to keep a % in an underperforming assets.  However keeping a % works for some if not most. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:21:35
Wtf are you talking about 
Why is bitcoin not made for investment?  It was literally designed to mimic gold to create an ecosystem to allow miners an incentive to run the blockchain.
It has a fixed amount that will get smaller and smaller over time due to lost coins.  So a desirable item with fixed numbers.... it's pretty much the text book of what people invest in.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:40:04
That was far from a disrespectful statement.  You should probably learn how to click reply too so people know wtf your talking about.  
Your asking people to try to help you recover someone ELSEs bitcoins in a community who's philosophy is basically trust no one.
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:21:30
exactly.  so its overall growth is still an uptrend and its not at an all time high to scare the SEC.  all this happens a couple days before the verdict comes out.
this was just a hypothesis anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:06:19
Why?  The SEC is overwhelmed ATM with only 2 of 5 chairs and trumps policy has shown less regulation.... I fully expect the ETF to be approved.  There is no reason why the SEC would draw this out for 3 1/2 years to deny it.  EVEN if it gets denied I HIGHLY doubt a flash crash would happen as bitcoin as over long term has had steady growth.  
There's a total of 6 MILLION Coinbase users now ( not sure how accurate that number really is tho) so most of the growth is from new money.  Bitcoins almost a 20 billion market and getting national and worldwide press.  Most of the new money probably has no clue there has even been an ETF pending unless they are reading BTCNEWS and Reddit.

You are still paying 1000 for 1BTC and not getting 1.1BTC so you've taken a 100 USD loss before you get the coin

I love this guy... he always talks crash... 700s... uh okay... China FROZE withdrawals and it dropped only 10% FOR ONE DAY.... I hardly think a failed 4 year ETF is going to cause it to drop 35-40%.

Fucking why?  I'm so tired of these posts... what is your source or reasoning....again bitcoins price has never been dependent on an ETF... the ETF has been pending for 3.5 years.... so fast money has been waiting with their investments for 3.5 years?  
The only reason the price will drop significantly is people like you putting so much emphasis on something that really doesn't matter.  
Go ahead and sell and try to buy back in, you might make money you might not... good luck cause imma buy the fucking dip if there's one and I know a lot of people that will as well.

@_date: 2017-03-06 01:59:49
I'm sorry.  my assumption was my node was mining.... I should of put that in the main body.  
If I wasn't running ASIC and I set my fee to very low, the likely hood someone picking it up is very small.... and it being the only thing I put in the block.  Would it be possible or who I need a shitload of hash power 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:26:14
That is actually not true.  If your doing a boat analogy segwit would be the people letting the passenger cap not matter.  
BU would be building a bigger ship.  The problem with building a bigger ship is next time there's a problem, they will need to build another even bigger ship... if bitcoin ever got to VISA status it would require something like a 1.6 GB block.... of which the average joe would not be able to run a node (currently who knows with future technology upgrades) which in turn would cause more and more centralization as less and less people can run a node.
@_date: 2017-03-06 02:27:18
So this is what I've found.... it's actually not Coinbase charging you, It's the bank.  Coinbase uses a payment processing fee through England even tho they are USA based.... 
I'm going to try to call my bank in the AM and see if I can get a refund.  I bought over 1400 in Ether that's pending right now... that will be like a 50 or 60 fee.... they can suck my D
If you use a debit card or credit card... you get hit with Coinbase 3% fees plus 3% international fee (or however that's calculated....  that is downright stupid

Whoever the address is, if you look at the price history they didn't get into it until early 2016.   So it couldn't be Tim Draper either he was invested in it long before then.  
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:04:57
Ummm.... I don't know maybe the start of mass adoption....  you are saying what made bitcoin rally but the blocks are full.... full blocks are the use of bitcoin not ETF speculation (yes I understand it plays a part in it) Japan started accepting bitcoin as legal payment for the country in march as well as being the new leading trader in bitcoin.  The Swiss put over 250 bitcoin ATMs (in their train ticket machines).... as well as getting massive coverage for news media for beating the price of 1oz of gold.... 
It doesn't really take that much for the price of bitcoin to shoot up or down 100 bucks.

I care, comments like this are the reason why the BTC community has become a cancer.  The guy was showing his support for how's he is helping the BTC community and you have to be a dick.
And do you know how ignorant you sound.  that might be chump change for you, but one of bitcoins purposes is to give banking to the masses that don't have access to banking.  You think people that don't have banks just have 500USD laying around.  That to them would be a fortune.  
So stop being a fucking prick and shut your mouth unless you have something positive to say

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:35:48
I think the price is inflated maybe 100-200 dollars for early people trying to make a quick buck.... 
If the price drops to as the guy said 300 it's because all these weak hand "wanna be hodlers"  freaked out and sold cause someone else posted about selling. 
The price of bitcoin hasn't been dependent of an ETF since its inception so why do you guys think bitcoin is just gonna tank.  
You do realize the price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand and that's because of the Hodlers.

I've never really understood this argument when it comes to bitcoin vs Gold.  If bitcoin fails at being a currency because we can only make money speculating on it and we don't have currency until we sell.... that statement to me is more toward gold.  
Can you send your gold to newegg or overstock... or 100s to thousand of stores in Japan who has made it a legal currency.   I don't know a single place that I can take a gold bar to and get something.
