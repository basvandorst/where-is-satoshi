swap-coin.net which is the one they were manipulating to get their original high market caps.

The same way it sorted out MtGox...And Pirates scam... and all the other scams. Oh no it just lets them continue happening because money makes people act irrationally.

There are not 'True Bitcoiners' stop being short sighted, massive fraud hurts everyone, not just those involved.

It is pretty stupid to write a paragraph without bothering to use the internet you are connected to for learning about the subject you are writing a paragraph about.
The devleopers owning an exchange and the pay gateway and all the coins in an non transparent way, without any regulation or oversight is a cause for concern. Especially when they have a long well documented track record of lying and exaggerations.  Learn about it, because you will be forced to eventually when the blowblack happens.

X100 this.

While there are people who own bitcoin that are libertarians, not everyone involved is a libertarian. It doesn't have a political affiliation test in the client.
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:52:59
Morons? I got into a bitcoin in early 2010, and I'm not a short sighted moron, its not mandatory.

Pro-tip: You are wrong. The SEC investigates ponzie schemes which this absolutely falls under.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:57:55
I guess we can trust that they won't lose keys, they have a great track record of that, oh wait....
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:36:36
Obvious scam, but exchanges like Shapeshift.io claim they are not a scam and it is a witchhunt so they can continue profiteering from the scam. If we boycott the exchanges involved, it will prevent this from happening again.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:15:49
Well they operated a ponzi bitcoin mining compnay and are now using this to hide their loses. Considering the owner owns btc.com and is funneling massive amounts of bitcoins into his own wallets it should be a concern for bitcoin holders as it will affect them even if not directly.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:56:32
That is what I was thinking. 
But I mean sand boxes can never be escaped right? Right?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:04:51
Claiming pointing out an obvious scam is a witchhunt? Think shapeshift pulled that card before the back pedalled too.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:52:03
Peercoin is not comparable to Paycoin. Sunny king invented the proof of stake protocol with Peercoin. Paycoin copied it and hard coded higher rewards for the developers then premined 97% of it. Then promised it would go to 20 USD based on future big investors the developers had lined up to buy in.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:00:31
So instant withdrawals and its secure multisig addresses? That sounds fishy. You don't get maximum security and maximum speed, those are inverse proportional relationships.
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:57:16
Yeah, it would have been nice to have ANY details. Instead of announcement that basically said they outsourced their servers because they are too incompetent to sysadmin.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:18:04
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:18:26
GAW doesn't pull off everything they say they are going to do. They delay, lie and backtrack. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:14:57
By comparing other altcoins to Paycoin you legitimize paycoin. You cant honestly say that Peercoin is on the same level as Paycoin.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:45:13
This is exactly how the free market sorts it out, customers vote with their dollar (bitcoins). They stop using the exchanges that promote and profit from scams and as result those exchanges go away.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:38:38
Obvious but so many people in the community are profiteering from it like Shapeshift Bittrex and Cryptsy. They collect the fees and claim it is not a scam. If we stop using their services until they start instutiting quality standards scams will have a lot harder time getting traction.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:11:43
BTC-e is still up after all of this and American exchanges fall apart all the time due to incompetence. So the statement from the article was laughable.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:49:23
There is a difference between Peercoin, a coin that introduced proof-of-stake. And a coin that copies Peercoin and premines, codes in higher rewards for developers, hypes and promises return on investment by later investors who will raise the price to 20 USD.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:14:24
According to GAWCEO it was offline because of Cloudflare lol.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:33:15
You are talking to the owner of shapeshift an exchange that trades it and is trying to justify it.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:22:46
No one wants to hear your gambling stories.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:28:45
CounterParty is not a decentralized bitcoin/usd exchange. And this thread wasn't plug your altcurrency funtime hour.
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:25:19
Outsourcing shows they cannot manage their own servers. Also cloud services open new avenues of attack. Cloud servers are convenient, and security is the opposite of convenient.  
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:23:08
This topic is not really about that, its about how we stand up against XPY scam and those profiteering from it.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:10:42
You think you are being clever but you are just showing your ignorance.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:47:03
There is no IF. Paycoin is a scam.
You are profiting from it and pretending like that is noble. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 21:55:40
Did Amazon really go out and make sure they had brand new servers? I doubt it. Sounds pretty dumb to most people in IT (which is most people in Bitcoin)
Also what exactly are they using multisig on? Who has the keys? If they have most of the keys, we know they aren't really good at keeping things like keys so its not any additional security?
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:12:40
Thats a very poor attitude. We should actively try to self regulate and prevent massive amounts of money being funneled to sammers when we can. We should be boycotting any exchange that accepted XPY (Bittrex, Cryptsy, Shapeshift)
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:41:31
There are exchanges that have quality standards. The ones that don't should need to be pressured by the community to stop turning a blind eye to scams to make more profit. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:19:47
Are saying VCs won't build towards decentralization?
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:13:51
Yet respected services are showing the bunk numbers only assisting in the scam.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:03:42
That website is terrible. It looks like a poorly done 5 dollar template.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:30:58
They have been profiting from XPY and they exchange coins. It is an exchange, just a centralized one.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:39:17
And a lot of services are profiteering from it, knowing its a scam and looking the other way like shapeshift, bittrex and cryptsy.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:37:28
No you need to know who is actively exchanging it and claiming it is not a scam like Shapeshift.io. 
We need to boycott shapeshift, bittrex and cryptsy until they clean up their act and stop backing scams for profit.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:11:19
You should be embarassed if you can't see a difference. 
Paycoin has hardcoded higher block rewards for the developers holding specific private keys over regular users of the client.
Paycoin services are all centrally ran by the developers of the coin. While Bitcoin developers work on Bitcoin (go figure!). 
Paycoin developers promised specific price values based on future investors they promised would invest. Bitcoin developers would never do that.
Paycoin developers run a for profit mining company. Bitcoin developers are community members who contribute because they know they are working on a good project. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:54:35
So you are clearly not a programmer, because anyone who is capable of reading code is impressed with peercoin. But I guess if gamblers don't want to gamble on it, technology doesnt matter?
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:23:20
I'm aware of that, and it is my point. They claim brand new hardware then claim they are using AWS. Basically at best two of the points are the same thing trying to make it seem like they did something special instead of just outsourcing because they are incompetent. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:47:35
Markets have a choice, they can choose to do a little research and avoid offering their customers ponzi schemes. And customers have a choice to stop using ones that keep promoting ponzi schemes.
