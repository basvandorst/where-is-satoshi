sorry but I wish not to disclose my btc amount. They were sent from a multisig 3xxx address to a random 1xxx address 9am 2nd august and have not yet moved.

This is a bit confusing. I had only bitcoins deposited. Does this mean my account may have been affected, but not other peoples accounts with bitcoin deposits? So some customers lose funds, while others don't?

Will bitfinex refund users who lost bitcoins 100%? Or will users take the losses?

If "some" can gain access to their funds, then bitfinex will not go bankrupt. That means they have the ability to buy back ~$60m in bitcoins. It's not like they would allow withdrawals for some, but not others. 
If they can't find the funds, and they go bankrupt, then there is no such thing as refunding only some customers fully, and others none at all. If they can't find the funds then they go bankrupt, then over the course of a long legal matter, all customers will receive the same haircut on their total funds held at bitfinex.
Not saying I know what they will do, but legally they can't refund some but not others.

I have two questions many probably wonder too.
1) If I had bitcoins deposited in bitfinex, and they were stolen, will bitfinex account for this or have I lost my money?
2) I tracked the addresses I deposited to. I deposited in July 20th and 22nd, to two separate addresses. Both addresses sent the coins to a particular address (both sent to the same), around 13 hours ago today. Does this mean my coins were stolen?
