I know not if you believe in god/s, but Statism is your religion.

Basically because they were *restrained* and unable to do all they wanted to do by having to use real money (backed by actual value, like gold). They realized if they just changed a few laws they could print all the money they want, and that's what happened after going off of the gold standard.
Many of the wars that have been fought since, as as example, would have literally been impossible to fund without this system.

lol, alright. Cheers.

Not trying to be a dick, but with that logic "Gold CEO", "U.S. Dollar CEO" and "Hamburger CEO" are all equally applicable (and confusing) when applied to people in those markets. If it's confusing or incredibly vague, it probably shouldn't be done. And of course, you never see titles with the labels I exampled.

Stupidest shit anyone's said all day on all of Reddit. You need to not be a mod anymore.

So you sell something online but little do you know, the money you receive is from a 3rd party who is also buying something, not the person you sold to. But it seemed all was well, because you got the money like you were supposed to.
And that's all your fault because....

Wow, so your reply is a really horrible false dichotomy?
What about the guy who innovates, making better ASICs for lower cost, regardless of not living in China, and sets up a huge mining facility in the West thus increasing competition and diversity and decentralization?
I don't know why you're bringing charity into this (giving). You can give whatever you want to whomever you want (bitcoin, or otherwise) but when you start requiring it of everyone, that's when the end is near. Using examples that have to do with charity and scammers is ridiculous. 
What happens when every computer can mine equally and botnets take over thousands or tens of thousands of systems because those systems are run by your typical generally unknowledgable citizen, rather than the experts who run serious mining operations.
Would you rather have a million dollars of your wealth in one (or a few) professionally run institutions with vaults, guards, and lots of security measures... or would you rather have 1,000 people hold onto $1,000[cash] each, in their home or their car or their wallet?
Please deal with the arguments I previously gave you or kindly don't bother replying, because you're not saying anything of substance and you're not countering anything I'm saying with facts, reason, or logic.
P.S. Please, please, for your own sake read Atlas Shrugged.

I'm sorry but you really could not be more wrong, and is correct.
The whole thing is FUELED by incentive (calling it greed is sophistic). Of course some places will have cheaper electricity costs than others, just as some places have more oil than others, or more coastline than others. People going to mine where is cheapest is as natural as people mining for gold where they know it is concentrated in the Earth's crust.
Define the objective *fair*, in this case. I'm guessing you would say that it's fair when people who haven't had to invest a great deal of time or money would be able to mine as well as those who have.  Well that's like someone having the same job as you, gets paid the same monthly salary as you, but they only come into work 5 minutes per day while you work 10 hours a day. Would you call that fair?
*And no, I'm not a (biased) miner.

No, people who worked hardest for it earned it. What you're advocating is Socialistic, in that everyone deserves or is entitled to equal chance at earning a block, regardless of anything else. And I doubt you have any idea of the problems that come along with that.
I don't want to solve a block. I want people who are experts--the best of the best--to solve blocks. Just as I do not want to fix my own dental issues, or my neighbor's dental issues. I want an expert who knows what he or she is doing to fix those problems.
As Ayn Rand said, Altruism is death and destruction.

lol, love how you worded it. And yeah, that image is kind of unnerving.

That was great, thanks for posting.

Well, they *are* basically camwhore credits, a la Myfreecams/Chaturbate.
Edit: As I see mentioned already.

Why is it shady? Would you not need to be paid for your time? What's the alternative? Force/threaten them to testify?
