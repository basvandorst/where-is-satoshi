Put them in places where you see other stickers. This is a tip from a friend who is into graffiti. You always want to put stickers where you see stickers already if you don't want them to get taken down. Sure, an ATM might seem like it has great impact for example, but this would just get taken down. If you look for street signs where the backs are covered for example, you will get months or years longer "run time."

Paying 2% for an index fund is outrageous... It's just an index. It's not like there is an active manager involved
