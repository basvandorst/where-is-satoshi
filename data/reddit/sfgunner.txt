Yes, in Germany those who participated were held responsible (the Hague) and the nation carries a deep and abiding shame about WW2 (taught in their schools) that will last for generations to come. 
In the US, those same murderers are given free appetizer coupons at Applebee's and invited on stage at "serious thinktank forums" to spread their message of how death by Depleted Uranium is good for you because democracy.

If you aren't aware of what your CIA, Pentagon, and Executive branch have been up to the 20 years, that's because you're a dumb shit, not me.

Your country is a murderous behemoth, causing millions of deaths around the world for the benefit of oil companies, neocons, and Saudi/Israeli lobbyists.
Your country has killed millions in an illegal war, started by a giant lie. 
Your country is ruled by people who only pay lip service to democracy, but whose party systems are controlled by whoever lends the party the most money.
You could be grateful for this knowledge, and maybe engage in some self reflection, but instead you'd like to shoot the messenger for not giving you 100%, even though he did it for free and at great risk to himself.
People like you are why we still have governments like the current US mass murder machine.

Your fallback position is remarkably free of any morality or self-reflection. Good day.

Giving weapons to actual Nazis is not the actions of a peaceful neighbor. Maidan was a coup led by Nuland and Soros, or do you not know such things?

Maybe Hillary and her friends shouldn't have tried to kill him when they were in power. 
Maybe you shouldn't have voted for a bloodthirsty murderer who bought your party with a loan.
But maybe you have no capacity for self-reflection.

I'm from America bitch, and that's my tax money you're throwing down a hole to invade the world for powerful people who give no fucks about you.

Seriously, your response makes me very happy that there are people like Assange, who point out the hypocrisy of positions like yours, that expose the naked lies you believe in daily.
To know that he is stripping hypocrites like you of any legitimacy before the world, that is why he is a hero and you are someone people will ask about like Nazis and Slave Owners: "Why didn't anyone do or say anything?"
It's you. You are the problem.

Call the waaahmbulance, we got an American who is sad his lying murderer politician didn't get elected. 
Hillary still had blood dripping from her fangs from Libya when the news was published that she had bought the entire DNC and your democracy was a sham.
What's an American to do when a furriner points out his Manifest Destiny is just murderous lying horseshit? 
KILL THE MESSENGER.

The U.S. is arguably the greatest anti-freedom influence in many parts of the world today. Maybe instead of shooting the messenger you should actually take a look at the great mass murder and evil that US politicians and military daily commit in your name. Consider:
* Libya
* Syria
* Afghanistan
* Iraq
* Ukraine
* and next up...Venezuala
The US has intentionally destabilized, invaded, bombed, and murdered their way across these countries, causing millions of deaths. None of these countries ever attacked America/ns. 
All those deaths are on your head as a US citizen, but you want to get on a soapbox and criticize Assange. Hypocrite.

If you put your hand over your heart, and sing patriotic songs, and "support your troops", you are part of the great evil. 
So noble of people like you to expound your own powerlessness in the face of evil when you are nothing of the sort. Assange has proved we are not so powerless after all. 
But this thread is full of people who are "powerless to stop US murder machine" but not "powerless to advocate for prison for Assange". 
By your words you point out what you are: a lickspittle to the powerful. Why should anyone listen to cowards like you when people like Assange are posting the actual truth?
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:21:34
If you are an American, and you think Assange is a shitbag but not:
* \-Yourself for paying taxes for illegal wars of mass murder
* Your politicians for covering up and lying you into mass murder
* Your military for comitting mass murder in not just one, but several countries, over the last 20 years. All based on lies
Then you might be a hypocrite.

Lol. Money and power begetting money and power are not new. Neither are regulation games. Read the history of copyright if you want to see true cronyism.

See [this comment]( from u/Calebthe12B. It's not their choice and there is pretty much no incentive for small local banks to take any risks on the 1% customer that is doing something outside their level of understanding or risk appetite. Best thing to do is look for and find banks that are willing to deal with the perceived risks of "virtual currencies," and work to help positively define their understanding of them.

This. Credit Unions don't have any incentive whatsoever to get on the bad side of financial regulators. They are supposed to be the "safe and simple" option. Best thing to do from a business standpoint is speak with your money and find someone willing to understand and take the risk.
