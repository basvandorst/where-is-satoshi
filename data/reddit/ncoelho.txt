Yes, they do. But you can move your wallets around. If your wallet software doesn’t allow you to import and export wallets, something is wrong there
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:22:56
That’s how a wallet works, if you don’t have the private key is not your wallet.

Thank you, that's very good feedback. I really appreciate that. Let me try to reply to that the best I can.
1. We used an automatic app store image generator. It's not amazing but when you are doing localization, translations and multi-language it speeds up the process because we just need to do it once and its automatic generated for other languages. We need to find a better way. But I agree they look very different from the rest.  
2. Totally agree, we will get there.  
3. Our roadmap is public on the repo and our kanban board as well. At the moment we are working on HD wallets (QA stage) and lightning network integration (DEV stage). I think that's step forwards for the industry, at least the LN integration. Take in consideration that we just started, so for sure we are still catching up. We also think that's better done that perfect.  
Thank you once again for your feedback, anytime feel free to send us more.

Hi there. Seems a valid use case, can you tell us more why you need this feature and in which case you use it like that, so we can understand it better.
We are about to release HD wallets and automatic detection of different address standards. 
Multiple address can be a nice feature to add.

@_date: 2019-08-02 16:05:17
Actually that’s incorrect. Bluewallet provides an opensource lightning backend, that allows you to run your own node and at the same time provide liquidity to your friends and family. You should check it out!
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:24:59
With that setup you can now connect your electrum to bluewallet and have a top notch mobile bitcoin app
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:08:54
Yes, through Electrum Personal server, ElectrumX, Electrs, etc.
Regarding the withdraw on Lightning not really, Lightning is still to early to invest more time on it with our resources, we are more focused on onchain at the moment.   
But there are many services that easily allow to do that, [fixedfloat.com]( [zigzag.io]( [boltz.exchange](
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:25:12
Bluewallet allows to completely control the fees. Use a wallet with this feature always
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:26:16
Onchain is not custodial. Lightning can be used non-custodial. 
We are experimenting with new tech that probably will have many custodial services, from wallets, from channels, from channels management, from inbound liquidity, from watchtowers. How is that bad faith or fatal error?

Hi there. The wallet is non-custodial by default, it allows you run your own bitcoin node with electrum as well.
If you are talking about lightning, lightning itself has no keys. We have custodial/hosted wallets by default, but you can also connect your own lightning node, the user can choose. All the information about how it works its available and explained on the website and medium article.

Use a wallet that gives you control of your private keys. Like this one 
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:14:49
LN is in private beta at the moment.
Node settings to use own node are planned and will be available in the future.
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:58:47
Bitcoin wallet is not custodial.
And you can take your coins back to the blockchain. There’s an withdraw option.
No need for FUD...
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:32:38
This is not true. You can easily withdraw your founds with services like [zigzag.io](

@_date: 2019-01-09 15:47:58
I'm the co-founder (see other post). I'm not shilling, I'm literally explaining our wallet :)
you can have a non-custodial solution. But that doesn't mean that everyone can do that or will be in the future with the current proposals... I don't think people should be limited anyway on their lightning usage just because they don't have the technical knowledge to have their own setup.
Also, it doesn't mean that our solution won't evolve to minimize trust as we go. We plan to introduce neutrino and watchtowers and other technologies as they become ready to do so.
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:52:38
Can I ask you why do you have this use case? Why do you use broadcast later for?
Just out of curiosity to understand better

You can sign a transaction without broadcasting it :)
The features will be the same for both android and iOS, you can check them here.
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:30:12
Hi there,  
I'm Nuno from [bluewallet.io]( happy to answer your questions or doubts.  
You should start with an HD segwit (sorry for the bad naming here) and HD wallet stands for Hierarchical Deterministic. This will generate a different address every time you want to receive Bitcoin, so the sender can't track your wallet address that easily compared to single addresses wallets.
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:33:35
Hey man, we are an open source project, free to use.   
I've been sharing our work in this subreddit from day 1, since we were asking for beta testers. Our names and pictures are on our website. We post articles with clear information on our work.   
I love this community and I will keep sharing our team work as long as the community wants it.   
If you have any problems our doubts, just ask. I will keep replying the same way I do since day one. I do this for fun and for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:25:46
We allow negative balances on our current solution. Just because someone one the internet is saying that that is a bug it doesn't make it true :)  
The reason we allow negative balances is because we can't know the fee on LN upfront, so instead we choose to let the users balance go negative and let the "system" take the cost.
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:22:08
Try [bluewallet.io]( 
You can also use bitrefill directly through the wallet marketplace
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:41:56
that's great criticism, no problem with it at all.  
We don't have withdraw at the moment, but we are linking to [zigzag.io]( to make easier for the users to withdraw their funds.  
The reason we haven't implement withdraw yet, and we are still thinking about it... Is because it will drastically increase our surface attack. And let's be honest here, we are 3 guys doing this on our free time, we don't have enough man power to protect a surface attack that large. We are pushing LND implementation as much as we can, but also trying to be reasonable about it.
The tech will mature over the next months, and hopefully the app will mature with it.   
If what we are doing seems shady, that's not our intention at all. We do try to make clear what we are doing, we invest the time to write about it, so people that are looking for the information can find it and we keep our github repo open and developing on top of it.  
Hope that answer your doubts. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:56:25
You can try [bluewallet.io](  for iOS and android. It is open source.

There’s an option to connect your lightning node on the settings
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:37:11
Yes, this is true.  
Lightning itself by design will never be a 100% non-custodial solution. I'm sorry if it is the first time you are reading this, but it is the true.
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:03:05
Not exactly. The bitcoin part is not custodial and the lightning part has an option on the settings to connect to your own node.

I think I read that expression somewhere... is that a feature name, which one?
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:28:57
They have different trade offs. On green you have a multisig with a central “green server”, which can be good or bad, for instance good in theft cases and bad if green disappears or in terms of compatibility with other wallets. In blue you are in charge of your own security, which again is good and bad, but the wallet does provide security features such as plausible deniability, multiple storages, encryption or watch-only wallets.
Here’s a more complete feature set

you should use watch-only wallet for this purpose, no need to be paranoid, this is a valid use case with proper solutions. No need to have your app off or uninstalled, just use normally to receive when you want.

Hi there, if you tap on the value the keyboard should go up and allow you to input.
If it is not working for you, can you share your phone and OS version? Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:50:12
Interesting, let us analyze that approach. Basically our idea is to start from here and minimize trust on 3rd parties as we move forward. 
Thank you so much for the feedback, really appreciate it!

We don't have a strong privacy focus at the moment like Samourai, if that's what you are looking for, then maybe Samourai is a good option for you. We do however allow you to easily control wallets independently. Good for segregation of funds and managing UTXOs to control your transaction history which is key for maintaining privacy.  
We have an iOS version, I don't believe Samourai provides one.  
But honestly I'm not very happy to put my bitcoin on a wallet were its devs hide behind masks. We have nothing to hide.
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:32:28
Hi there. Tell us more. We are here for the feedback, far from saying this is perfect... :)
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:25:53

The currency part is not finish yet. Will note down your feedback, thanks!

[bluewallet.io]( it’s very simple, give it a try
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:54:11
Sending a tx via lightning is only available for invoices. So you need an address or a QR code to scan that already has a value. For instance like yalls.org
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:41:10
Try [bluewallet.io]( has lightning support as well
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:55:52
It is a place that has lightning enable services. You spend/earn bitcoin in some of them
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:22:07
Try [bluewallet.io]( , lightning enabled wallet
@_date: 2018-12-22 01:02:09
Uff I get it, but at the moment we are testing from iPhone 6s up... it is really hard to support older phones :/
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:11:19
Yes, this was just a 1st release with the bare minimum. Next releases will bring more options 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:36:35

Hi there, lndhub is inside the wallet. Can you be more specific? Thanks 
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:06:16
Thanks. I see what you mean ��
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:41:50
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:51:16
Thanks for the suggestion. Have been thinking what is the best way to do that, and that seems a pretty good one! :)
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:47:41
Hi there. On all wallets on the top right you have the options menu. There you can backup your wallets.
At the moment you can refill from bitcoin wallets inside bluewallet. So you need to create a wallet before or import a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:31:23
Yes at the moment we are using blockcypher, if you have better alternatives let us know.   
At the moment we are working on our own backend with electrum and our own lnd solution as well. And the ability to plug to your own nodes.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:45:46
Hi there, thanks for trying blue wallet. It works this way:
- create a bitcoin wallet and send founds to that wallet
- or if you already have a bitcoin wallet you can import it
- after having a bitcoin wallet with founds you can then select that wallet to topup/refill your lightning wallet
Let me know if you need any help
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:16:39
At the moment the password functionality is limited. It doesn’t allow to change or remove. In the future we are going to improve that
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:43:21
Yes, when you buy on coinbase, you don’t own your private keys. So not your coins. Use a wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:55:05
Thanks for the feedback. Yes that's our thinking for now, let's see how it goes, hopefully this is a good compromise at least for people to start experience lightning ⚡
@_date: 2019-05-06 08:56:35
You can use bluewallet non-custodial.

I replied on my previous comment. It was what we defined as the minimum necessary functionally to release. Now its time to have people use it and get feedback.
Withdraw, sending and invoice creation will come after :)
