Indeed they are somewhat lower in Europe ([Finnish sample PDF price list]( 0.31% debit (cap 0.75 EUR), 0.90% credit for EU-domestic pin-and-chip or contactless transactions).
I'm guessing some possible reasons might be:
* Chip-and-pin is widespread =&gt; less fraud.
* No "cash-back" bonus stuff US cards seem to have, at least around here =&gt; lower card provider cost.
* Previous EU anti-trust investigations/settlements concerning interchange fees.
As said, these are complete guesses of a layman :)

AFAIK both domestic and international SEPA transfers have to be priced the same by law.
Here in Finland that means they are "free" (as was the national transfer system before SEPA existed), but obviously this isn't the case in every country as can be seen reading this thread.
Addendum: Regarding OP's question, the incentive would probably still be the quickness (at least here SEPA transfers across banks tend to take 1 business day - within the same bank they are instant).

[English price list PDF of a Finnish provider](
tl;dr: Debit 0.31% (capped to 0.75 EUR), credit 0.90% (uncapped), cards from outside EU and magnetic/manual transactions have higher costs.

The *debit* card fee will be capped to 0.2%, the *credit* card fee would be 0.3%.
E.g. in Finland the VISA/MC debit card fee is already just 0.31% for most transactions ([English price list]( of a large operator), so 0.2% is not that far off...
Though credit cards fees do start at 0.9% currently...
