Bold take. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:24:18
You are 100% correct

You realize speculation is what moves volatility correct? And you tell me I’m being vague when it comes to investment principles but the only thing you’re arguing is semantics. 
Also I’m not preaching responsibility whatsoever. I literally just said I love to gamble. And there’s nothing wrong with throwing some money at crypto, but you’re the exact type of person that gives it a bad reputation because you can’t acknowledge the difference in what this is.

Receipts or “GTFO” as you said

What am I fearful of

This is the funniest jibberish I’ve ever read


Lmfao 


Oh like when your “assets” are so incredibly unsecured that a hacker can steal 70mm like they did last week? Or like when your “assets” aren’t legal tender? Or like when your “assets” swing 20% in a day? You call that control ��
YOU are the type of person that makes people who play crypto look retarded

You seem like a very erratic person. Don’t kill your self when you lose 40% on your 600 dollar BTC position in a day. I know that’s probably a lot of money to you but you can make it back.

You realize that even blue chip company’s stock prices revolve around thoughts, opinions, and future expectations right? A company can beat quarterly earnings and tank 8% that day. 
But even better, what you’re describing isn’t legal tender. It isn’t a company. It isn’t secure. It’s backed by nothing. The founder and biggest holder is anonymous. 
I love gambling. It’s fun. That is what this is. Do not confuse it with anything other than that.

Please enlighten me where I’m wrong 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:16:32
I literally asked him where I was wrong and he said nothing... so idk what you’re talking about man. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:38:34
 No what’s written in the genesis block and how is it relevant to anything I said 
What about anything I said makes me “chained to the debt/tax/regulation cluster fuck.” 
Also, inflation is currently below 2% and even then they will probably raise interest rates again which will  taper inflation even further 
You’re all over the place. I’m not really sure what your point is. But I see you like to say fuck a lot.

Lol keep telling yourself that. I suppose the only way you can defend this from the definition of sheer gambling is that you’re not inherently at a disadvantage like if you play blackjack at a casino. 
People are refinancing their homes and “investing” into bitcoin because of this sentiment lmao. There’s a threshold of when something becomes so
Volatile that speculation is not the correct word to use.
