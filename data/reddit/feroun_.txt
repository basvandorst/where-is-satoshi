90% price threads... Why don't move them to bitcoinmarkets? More technical discussions would be nice. More tutorials on how to improve the network and more threads to support Bitcoin (SegWit, Lightning, etc.).

How about dollar-cost-averaging? Buy some this week, the next week and so on.
I would wait for the CME futures and see how it is going. There is going to be a huge gain or a huge drop IMO.

Bitcoin Core / the bitcoin foundation. Show the Core developers some love and maybe help them with donations! They are constantly working on making bitcoin better in a safe way.

The GUI does not. But the interface does.
As soon the GUI is released the percentage should rise though, many services are ready for implementation and waiting for this release.

Lightning Network Integration is at 72/75 at the moment - is lightning ready after 75/75? or do we need more testing? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:37:20
That is your problem! Get a hardware wallet first.

 is a hashtag I want to get started. Social Media is powerful, we should use it.

Segwit is much needed at the moment as many of you know.  Perhaps you think a tweet or hashtag isn't worth it and maybe you are right.
But a movement out of this would not only higher the pressure, also news are going to catch this and write articles about it.
Social media is powerful.
It is only one tweet, not much of your time is needed.

Why Bitcoin Cash then? Litecoin has way faster block times, also Ethereum with 17s is near instant.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:58
With the high fees in mind.. we and also r/bitcoin should promote a SegWit campaign.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:48:31
Hey guys,
in the last days we had an enormous price rally and lots of people coming from r/all and a lot of new subscribers - which is great for the bitcoin price.
But it isn't so much for the news, warnings and the progress which is made. We had great achievements the last days and I am looking forward to rolling these things out in the future. But it took me a long time (except some) to find the relevant articles in here.
The front page is basically just HODL texts or memes and price discussions and how someone bought this and that and what not. You need to check many posts to see what is happening with Bitcoin itself.
That is why I am suggesting to lock and move all price discussions to another sub, maybe r/bitcoinmarkets? A great example is ethereum IMO - Ethereum discusses news and progress, ethtrader discusses the price and news regarding the price.
This way the community could focus more on bitcoin itself, maybe even help growing and achieving things (SegWit implementation for example) like in the past. Bitcoin has so much more to show than its price. The price is only a result of the greatness of bitcoin.
This is of course my opinion and hope it is okay to say it here. What do you think about this?
Info: Post got removed by Automoderation for promoting altcoins. Havent heard back from the mods - posting it here. Just remove it if it is against the rules. Cheers!

Gemini for example. And If your amount is too much to lose, get a Hardware wallet.

It is because of AdSense/Doubleclick. One can remove them but they are appearing again and again. And manually blocking them is annoying.

I would go for the first two, bitcoin and Ether. Maybe 50/50. If you want to gamble pick an altcoin which is low at the moment. I like REQ, but that should be your choice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:45
I think he meant which year, not which bitcoin. Too much bitcoin for you my friend, how about a little rest, haha.

Search for a free bitcoin tx accelerator and use all those services. Give it a shot, maybe that helps!

Is it possible that exchanges and people blacklist this address? As it is known. Just thinking out loud here.

Users doesn't mean active. Only 25-30 % are really buying bitcoin I guess.

Started r/bitcoinonly for this but hasnt worked so far. No Drama, no political discussion, no shaming - just bitcoin news and technical discussion

Based on numbers from another exchange.. doesn't has to be the same here. But I don't believe everyone is buying, many Just create an account.

Bitcoin and Crypto is A LOT speculation - the early adopters take the risk. Either they win big time or they lose it all, that is why these gains are possible. One "killer app" of bitcoin is those gains, that is why some people are buying and holding it (but only so much that you could lose it all without struggling in life).
I do understand your point, other cryptos are offering same/better use cases in some ways. But I think because crypto isn't adopted by the masses and bitcoin is the most used and accepted by people and businesses, it is valued the most. This plus the first mover advantage make it the most valued crypto - which makes sense to me.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:23:04
Yeah you are right, he didnt look good with this thing.

@_date: 2017-09-05 08:58:37
How much is rich to you? I think it will at least go up to $25000 long term. So for a mill you need 40 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:51:48
Why do people value gold more than USD? People see positive things in gold and think of it as a store of value.
Bitcoin is decentralised - No bank, no government, no third party which controls bitcoin is needed
Bitcoin is faster than existing currencies - in only ten minutes you could send it from the us to russia for a (sometimes) small fee and bitcoin is borderless
Bitcoin is limited - 21 million only - so deflationary currency.. the more you hold the more it is worth IF people accept bitcoin.
People value it because of many reasons. Also bitcoin has the first mover advantage - it will always be the gold of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:57:59
People said this when it crashed from 11 to 2, from 37, from 1300, from 2800, from 4800.
But yeah maybe you are right this time, a deflationary currency isn't worth more over time /s.
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:03:35
I totally agree with your thinking. Bitcoin is high risk, that is why you should only invest what you are willing to lose.
Blue chips are more secure for example.
It is expensive but bitcoin will rise IMO.

Open a second bank account (online bank) at a bitcoin friendly bank (fidor for example if you are able to use it). Send money from your bank to the bitcoin friendly one and buy bitcoin! 
Worst would be buying bitcoin with PayPal at virwox or elsewhere (high fees unfortunately) if you are allowed to use PayPal.

I am seeing bitcoin more like gold 2.0 for now. It is way too slow to replace instant cash, maybe with lightning in the future.
Also it is deflationary and a riskier store of value.

PM if you need some help. Isn't that complicated.

What also baffles me is that Dorian **Satoshi Nakamoto** (whose house had been foreclosed by banksters) lived only a few blocks away from Hal Finney plus he was the first to receive a transaction. In my opinion the coding was from him, the whitepaper/idea might be from Szabo (Bitgold).
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:22:12
Who would contribute to that contract? Who would implement FIAT pairs? Would the Ethereum Community care if there are some small issues and work on it?
