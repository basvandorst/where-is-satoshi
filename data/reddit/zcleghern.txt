Successful campaigning doesn't invalidate what I said. Just because a lot of people like him doesn't mean what he proposes will work.

No,  because one of those is not like the other.

Seconded. I don't know any left wing people personally who aren't strongly in favor of internet privacy and encryption. Feinstein is the worst. She needs to be primaried ASAP (because there isn't a chance in hell of a Republican beating her in CA).

This is troubling, but does not show that the economy is doing badly, *just that it is likely to do badly soon*. That is a large difference.

U3 and U6 both look good. As for shadowstats....

That is, as you said, anecdotal. I think one should be skeptical of claims that the sky is falling.

No, this is elementary stuff.


The DPRK took power by force. You could argue that the social contract is still there, but I think it would be a weak argument. Taxes are a necessary part of government. Government is necessary to enforce contracts, protect the rights of individuals, and defend from outside threats. Of course, it does other things, such as regulate commerce to mitigate negative externalities, but that is merely preferred and not actually necessary and doesn't get my point across.


Shouldn't be necessary, but see above.


Not true. Every candidate wants to violate our rights in their own unique ways. I happen to find Trump's unacceptable. He is against internet privacy and wants to weaken free speech, as well as discriminate based on religion (his Muslim ban is unenforceable either way). 
If that's not enough for you as a bitcoiner, he generally says stupid things all the time, such as saying vaccines cause autism, Obama is a Kenyan, and climate change is a conspiracy made up by China. Do you really want this man as the leader of the free world?

Participating in an economy doesnt mean you are good at managing one. Cam Newton is not automatically qualified for Roger Goodell's job because he is a moderately successful NFL player. If he knew so much about economics he wouldn't commit the lump of labor fallacy so often and be stuck in an ancient, mercantalist mindset. He doesn't "understand" the national debt (i put that in quotes because he may just be pandering). Hell, he said we need to abolish the "Dept of Environmental", which he called the DEP, because it's killing businesses. He thought that China was part of the TPP. And then that doesn't even begin to touch on his foreign policy ignorance (not knowing the difference between Hezbollah and  Boko Haram, etc.).

No disagreement there.


No idea, but trade is one of them.


Trump doesn't have a coherent plan to shrink the federal government. He plans to build a 40 billion dollar wall, bomb the shit out of ISIS, and "close up the internet", which should scare any technologically literate person. His tax cuts would blow up the deficit, which I'm sure you agree is not good. 


I disagree, as do most people. Taxes are part of the social contract between citizens and the government. You can go live in the woods if you like.


This is a silly comparison.


Trump is very pro-mass surveillance. He does not understand the 4th amendment.

You can find corroborating opinions elsewhere if you like. Or not, do you have a specific rebuttal? Honestly, the burden of proof should really be on shadowstats, the people trying to refute the bureau of labor statistics.

Shhh.. don't mention that there are such things as negative externalities or market failures. The economic illiteracy in here is as bad as r/SandersForPresident.

Opposing the war in Iraq is not foreign policy qualification. If it was, Bernie would be just as qualified.
Trump's opinions that you don't like on economics show his broad misunderstanding of it. It would hurt the economy severely. His tax cuts may feel good to hear about, but it would blow a huge hole in the deficit that Obama has been trying (mostly unsuccessfully) to lower.
Let me point something out: The DEP doesn't exist. Trump made it up. He *may* have been referring to the EPA (that would be giving him a lot), but even Gary Johnson acknowledges the good that the EPA does.
As for who would be better? Clinton and Kasich, by a long shot. You may see them as "establishment shills" but I seem them as people with real and evidence-based detailed plans. Shit, even Cruz's terrible platform may be better. At least he knows the Constitution.
Edit: Don't worry, I'm not saying I like Clinton or Kasich. Clinton's stances on privacy and drugs are pretty terrible.

Donald Trump is no doubt intelligent,  but he has not shown it on the campaign trail. From his verbal blunders to nonsense policies he does not represent anything that would bring about any positive change.

Ok, it seems like some redditors absolutely love him 100% and others talk about him like a typical Republican.

The future effects of climate change may be inconclusive,but the fact that it is there certainly is not. What you linked to has some flaws, which have already been pointed out by others.

-protecting the environment/climate change/green energy
-marriage equality
-the space program?

No, he got downvoted because his comment was childish. There are many people on reddit who don't like Obama and/or are not Democrats.
