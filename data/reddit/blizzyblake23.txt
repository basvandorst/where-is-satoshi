He’s right ya know... he’s not telling anyone what to do, just what we should do if we want bitcoin as a whole to become more widely accepted... mass adoption is what we need.... not btc ETFs and shit like that.... I get what OP is saying and I strongly agree.... I personally would rather pay for EVERY LAST THING I can with my bitcoin instead of using cash, then turn right around and buy more bitcoin :) idc if i have to pay small fees, it’s helping others 1.) become aware of btc in general and 2.) create a frictionless peer to peer trading system like satoshi envisioned for us all!

What do you spend your US dollars on? The miners of the world would be the ones buying goods and services from the rest of the world who wants to “work” or “trade” for their wealth... but yes it would be much more difficult to change a nations financial system without a previous one in place!

Thank you, I was more or less asking if market cap was a direct correlation to the price, but like your saying currencies shouldn't have a market cap honestly... I was just thinking in my head trying to compare it to gold

Thank you, I was honestly curious haha

Not spending my bitcoin when I have the opportunity to! That’s in-negotiable in my book... if I have enough BTC in my wallet and enough cash on hand, I’m going to spend my coin and simple replace it with the fiat I was going to use anyways... ya you get beat up by fees and market volatility sometimes, but that’s the cost of the satisfaction I get for helping spread awareness and mass adoption

Sorry it was in reference to the bitcoin aspect of it...  I’ll remove it then, just figured I’d ask if anyone else HERE has ran into that problem as I have already read all the information I could from cash apps website and FAQs

Not sure why someone down voted you but that was very explanatory in my opinion... I get the concept but still is confusing lol but anyways thank you

It’s been 24 hrs already, I emailed customer service tho thanks everyone for putting up with my stupid question lol

To further support the network and spread awareness.... I use it any opportunity I have and just replace what i planned on spending in fiat

I’ve been curious about this myself, there are soooo many people that have bought small amounts of coin and lost their keys forever as well... I feel like it’s inevitable that when people start to use bitcoin as a daily currency and mass adoption begins, more and more people will run into this problem unless we come up with a solid idiot proof way to make sure these people don’t just get hacked but lose their Satoshi’s forever into the abyss like I have several times with LSK, XMR, BTC and ETH :(

How can everyone else profit off this tho? Shouldn’t they be looking at bitcoin as their saving grace... I wonder if it would be smart to buy property with crypto now while their economy is down? Any thoughts on buying stuff with crypto from there or how to go about doing it?

Completely regurgitating wishful articles lol... that’s why I come here with my questions/discussion so I can be enlightened by someone who knows more than myself
