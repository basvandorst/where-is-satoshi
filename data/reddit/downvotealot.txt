Except that our generation would be very poor no matter what, except for you guys. And that sucks.

As if bitcoin is distributed fairly.

You want to like a Microsoft product? You like to take it deep in the ass? Come on, even Google is more gentle about fucking its customers. Personally, I'll wait for a non-evil search engine before switching.

The latter. The Jewish law imposes no obligations whatsoever towards non-Jews, because they are seen as having a bad influence. 
Let me explain. This does not originate from hatred, but from Hanukka (~200BC): during that period, Jews befriended non-Jewish Greeks ("Hellenists") and it went really bad (long story, look up Hanukka...). After that, the Jewish lawmakers decided it would be best to remove any relations between Jews and non-Jews.
Fast forward 2200 years and many "Sages" reinterpreting each others' books, observant Jews are told to avoid having relations with non-Jews. This includes OP's Matanot LaEvyionim.
By the way, these gifts to the poor are only one of four actions that must be done on Purim.

The argument about medicine is the biggest one. That too is a job that used to be dominated by the opposite gender and note belongs to women. But somehow this fight is not even. Furthermore, medicine is a regulated market while the CS jobs are mostly completely open. 
That's why I strongly suspect some hidden interests are involved, given the staggering amount of money at stake in this market and its special treatment by these organizations. SJWs are sometimes right, but also sometimes not.

Usual currencies are meant to be traded too, yet the world works reasonably well with the top 2% holding 90% of the wealth, and I don't see why it shouldn't be able to work with BTC too. It's unfair but it's viable.

It doesn't help the amounts are so low. We should start speaking in microbitcoins. 
0.3BTC? Meh. 300000µBTC? Woah there, that's a big amount!

That's a fallacy. We can change laws to discard all bad things that are paid by taxes. It's not like there's some law of physics that prevents some taxes to pay some things.
