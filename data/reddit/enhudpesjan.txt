addresses starting with 1 are never segwit. starting with 3, maybe sometimes. starting with bc1, always segwit.

what is it?

market has nothing to do with bitcoin being useful. shady exchanges are the problem.

Right, it has slipped my mind as I was thinking of course I’m doing my own transactions, then I remember it’s on a exchange or 3rd party wallet. Thanks for clarification!

2MB block will eventually fill up also. Then what? Another fork?

I thought users were the "peers"

It's not an upgrade. It's a hard fork that will create a new chain. And the lack of replay protection just shows that the creators are stupid or that they don't care or that they want to cause a mess.
And yes 1MB is arbirtary, so is 2MB or 20 GB. Satoshi wrote about this at the beginning, a few choices and trade offs have to be made. If a block is too large, it is difficult to mine. If the blocks are propagated too fast, it could create a lot of wasted mining, so he chose 1 MB and 10 min, different coins chose differently. But don't fool yourself that S2X is an upgrade and that 2MB will be the "dominant" version.

yeah but it really doesn’t matter the isd amount you transfer. fees are based on transaction size in bytes not usd. anyways, go segwit!
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:38:24
when everyone adopts segwit and batched transactions, then we can mobe to schnorr and lightning and we will forget anout altcoins.

he just plays dumb in public, believe me he bought a metric shitton of BTC on the last dip.

hindsight is always 20/20. plus he did it for a little lulz also. it was a good deal back then. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:05:22
should be, yes. but crypto isnt regulated yet, except some ICO, plus he didn’t buy it himself.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:03:10
exactly this. he would never buy in person. obviusly

is there any real BTC adoption, ie if you invest your hard earned pesos into BTC does it have any actual value/use to you? thanks
