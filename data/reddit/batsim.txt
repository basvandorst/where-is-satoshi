Was that paid in a single TX?

How are they 'clearly' making good money? Wouldn't bitcoin mining firms be doing the best in the business?

OP, what faucets did you use?

I'm surprised that Elliptic and Netagio weren't mentioned in this article. They fundamentally invented the phrase 'Bitcoin Vault'.

I dread to think how many questions the guys at the Bitstamp stand are going to get asked...

Where in London did you spot this?

Is this not similar to what trade block have been doing for ages?

Who is the partner exchange?

Did they release the TXID's associated with the hack?
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:45:42
Did anyone ever get their coins back?

Does this mean they were just moving bitcoin across multiple addresses?

Out of curiosity, how were you scammed?

I agree it probably won't affect bitcoin too much. However, monero and possibly Zcash could be affected if they decided to sell. It depends on how much they seized.
