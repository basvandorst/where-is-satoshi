Because it’s Bitmain
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:34:22
Agreed, unlike most of the other exchanges that just roll over. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:37:23
That’s exactly what they said. That they wouldn’t respond. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 12:03:35
Yep,

Socialism failed?!? Who woulda thunk it
@_date: 2018-08-18 23:20:24
Don’t forget to go and rate this at one star. Also, read the reviews. The developer responds to all of the saying “Bitcoin Core is the accurate nomenclature” hahahahah. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:30:20
Agreed. We need complete privacy for all.

Ian has been one of the best supporters of crypto since near inception.  His show is where Roger Ver learned about Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:28:47
Correct answer
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:25:58
So when will Gemini help by implementing segwit and batching?
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:20:23
From all the non coders out there, thanks guys!
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:47:36
Yep, KYC / AML is bullshit. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 15:55:51
Why are you still using Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:46:01
�� revelation from 
- Was customer privacy breached? (or only aggregate data)
- How long have you known? 
- Did previous tracking providers break contract? (why no lawsuit yet)
- How is this an argument explaining acqui-hire of unethical people?

Most alt coins will eventually lose most of their value. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 00:09:27

The US government is one of the worst criminal gangs on the planet.

But this time is different with the USD ��

Not when the laws are bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:10:31
Down with Bitmain!

Just read everything by Rothbard.

I’m fucking buying

Timing the market is a fools errand. Unfortunately I speak from experience. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:27:31
Trezor. And I also have a ledger nano s
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:54:10
Yes, yes it does.

Good luck man. SWATing can be a death sentence. Glad you made it out alive. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:40:01
Blame our tyrannical governments.

@_date: 2018-07-31 18:22:18
Don’t. You won’t make a profit. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 20:00:52
You’d be surprised...

Wait you’re telling me the government can do whatever they want?!?
@_date: 2018-07-08 21:03:36
I’ll send you back 5 once you sent that to me.

Bitcoin-BTC is redundant. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:51:08
You were scammed -

@_date: 2018-07-15 16:25:14
Binance and Gemini stillnot using, right?
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:26:52
Yes, I got in on this.  Very nice of him!
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:19:34
Somebody recently donated 200 BTC (~$28,000) to Freedomain Radio, an internet philosophy show.  Great to see the bitcoins being used for such types of donations which I hope is a sign of things to come.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:10:19
I emailed Pento and nicely informed him that he was incorrect on all of the points he raised.  I suggest others NICELY do the same.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:55:34
Another great win for bitcoins.  Seems like they are coming very frequently nowadays.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:40:02
I've been emailing and tweeting a number of companies and people asking them if they'd be willing to accept bitcoin recently. If we all do this some people have to bite.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:51:15
Fuck yeah! Haha.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:50:05
Yet the media will still claim that the only use for bitcoin is drugs...
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:27:15
I am a hardcore anarcho-capitalist/voluntaryist, but I think spreading bitcoin is much more important now than spreading libertarianism.  Bitcoin is the most important invention for liberty since the internet and it has the potential to bring the state crumbling down.  
I'm spending the majority of my energy going forward to promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:24:35
They are making a fortune and should significantly increase their investment in security and functionality.
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:10:57
Yes, it is very attractive. Bitcoin is the best chance we have to bring down the state.

Here is the statement from the generous donor on Stefan's Facebook wall - 
I am very happy to say I donated 20k today. *dances through the room* :) Via bitcoin ofcourse. After I send it I started crying thinking about my foo. One of the first times. A great day it was. Thank you so much Stefan Molyneux and the whole Freedomainradio community for changing my life, learning me to listen to my feelings and what true love is. Your mission of changing the world by fighting parental abuse saves many young lives and is, although hard, I strongly believe the only way to get rid of violence, unhapiness and dysfunction, in personal life and in the world. Absolutely great also to see Michael M. DeMarco being part of the team now. May freedomainradio conquer the world! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:55:53
That was me at $7 and $20 and $30 and $50 and $100.  And that is still me...
