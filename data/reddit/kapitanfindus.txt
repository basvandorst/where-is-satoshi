GreenAddress has both pc and Android, with decent UI and nice features (white paper included!)
Check it out.

Classic news-showing app. Nothing complicated, a big list where I needed to add two views for shares and comment number ;)

I confirm the weirdness of Bitfinex as I had (promptly sent to my cold storage) some coins there. It was showing ridicoulously high Margin &amp; Tradable balance. The glitch started around 9 PM EST and I guess I was not the only one who have noticed it. I sent an email to the support before withdrawing, they probably know know (I saw they stopped the engine for some minutes).

This kind of posts once had the customary Bitcoin tip, too bad they are shutting it down.

I am curious about rUDP...can you point me to some code? Keep up the good work!

Probably you will receive something via mail. But I don't know how it's going to work.

Hey thanks! That's it.

It was up this morning (7.30 AM GMT-5). Then down from 9.00 AM on.

Definitely for this last one. And you can also take advantage of Java interoperability. A mavenized Scala + Java project would be good for performance and good for such a big number of developers.
Besides, read this:

If you ever go there, be prepared to answer weird questions that already have a pre-written answer...why would they ask you, with 500e invested, to go there? It just doesn't make any sense...I wouldn't go for the life of me.

Amazing, I'd just change the symbol, following this [post](

Well...yes I felt that too, but it was (it is) more a trust on the person/business than on the currency. I didn't feel any other vibe other than pride and pleasure regarding paying in BTC :)

LOL, I just found this :)

It's just is a bit sad that we don't have a lot of this posts in first page, while we have plenty of "I have made a gazillion dollar" "156.56$!" "MtGox is lagging".

There was a very interesting bitcointalk post that I can't find anymore, explaining why. It was showing that the entropy of randomly picked words (more than 5-6 I think) is higher than any human-rememberable password, even longer one. It was there because of a little comic strip...damn if only I could find it...

Hey guys, I was wondering...in order to prevent problems with the keypool, is there a counter you can read somewhere (a command to bitcoind or the client) to know how many keys are left in the pool?

I agree with you word by word, especially point three.
