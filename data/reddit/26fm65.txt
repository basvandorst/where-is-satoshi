Im sorry you gave it away. But i wondering if the price is at $100 will you sell it? 900X100 = 90K

maybe tell your wife even you guys did invest when it was $15. But i'm pretty sure u will sell when price hit $100 , $200ish. Hopefully she can feel better and not regret anything.

Sorry for your brother's loss.
I actually never heard of Bitcoin until late 2013 - early 2014.  I guess I'm glad i didnt mine at time because im sure i will be so depress if i sold it too early.

I'm think im about to give up crypto. Every week there is DIP . It become a buy high sell low scenario. I understand i should HODL. But look at the current stats for most top 20 cryto , no crypto is safe. Also every altcoin is mirror to Bitcoin index. Anything that happen to Bitcoin it affect everyone. 
Only way to make money is buy during Pump and then take the profit and sell. Example look at TRON most ppl make money if they brought it at .04 and sell when it hit .20 otherwise you make nothing. Because TRON is at the bottom low .05 
Tell me an crypto make profit if u hold from Dec or Jan? 
/end rant. call me weakhand or whatever . That is how i feel at the moment.﻿

I'm talking about Compared Dec 2017 vs Jan 2018. Everything surge in Jan then it got downhill for the past 2 weeks. I mean i know crypto  is never safe. But every week i seeing 20% drop is freak out.
