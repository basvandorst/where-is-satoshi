Mate you've literally just quoted a point that backs up what I just said and called me wrong?
$263bn interest paid in 2017. 95&amp; was to Treasury.
Where do private citizen's get their money? And the other countries? Did it just appear out of thin air?

The source doesn't make his point any less logical. It is irrelevant what the bank does with it's money. His analogy was spot on. 
Treasury creates $100. This is the only money in the system. Treasury lends the money to the Bank at 3&amp; interest who then lends the money to Joe for 5&amp; interest. Joe now has to pay back $105 to the bank who has to pay $103 back to the Treasury. Where does that extra $5 come from? It's printed by the Treasury and lent to the Bank again. 
Your point about the bank paying salaries/dividends etc is the difference between the 3&amp; it pays to the Treasury and the 5&amp; it charges to Joe.
This is how the world works. 
Printing money = debt.

This has happened in several countries on a small scale in recent times. Off the top of my head I remember this happened to Greece in 2012/2013 and all the banks and ATM's shut so no-one could take anything out.

US Treasury prints money and the Federal Reserve distributes it.
If what you say about the money going back to the economy were true then why is the US paying ~$250bn interest on debt per year? And why is it ~$20tn in debt? Why not write that off and reinvest the $250bn back into the economy?
