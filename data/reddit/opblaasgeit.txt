No, the people shorting it can be more accounted of a 'bad guy'. I get the same euphoric feeling when I see short get REKT.

obviously you are completely brainwashed by that evil-doer. Put all facts next to each other with an honest, rational, non-biased mind, and you see why the majority of EU sees him as an evil dictator.

It's not just in the financial world; it is also very much in the current culture state of living. Soon there will be no people who survived a world war and can tell their story personally to a new generation kids. To get something good, you must understand what it means to get something real bad.

You are german, right? seeing your username. If you haven't noticed, I'm dutch and the last time I checked the Netherlands is not in america, nor do we receive direct american news. The thing is, you have to read a subject from two opposite sides to create a strong opinion. What is an opinion if it only lives by the rules of side A, or side B, ignoring the opposite? I would suggest; be more open minded and don't let your mind get brainwashed by corruption and propaganda. The same goes for crypto.

Bitcoin always goes up or down with these numbers; it is normal. It isn't normal a valuta of a powerfull country loses more then 60% value in less then 10 years time. 90% of the time, when a valuta of a country goes down for a long time, it won't go up with the same value. Other thing is; millions of people depend their lives on the Lira, were as BTC is, up till now, not a primary valuta yet.

They check three things before calling a number:   
1: is the current price and the price difference I'm going to yell tolerant?  
2: How much bags do I carry?  
3: Is it a price no one else yelled before?  
The answers to these questions is a conclusion of the 40k he yells.

Really good initiative, but the fees of 10% and up are still to expensive; casual people don't use that, unless they lower the fees.

It reminds me of Twitch Plays Pokémon. You could share this on a gaming/twitch reddit; it would show the gamers you can play Pokémon together using tiny bits of cryptocurrency.

I saw BTC hitting the 9k and the first thing I did was go to this subreddit to upvote the first Vegeta. Well done mate.

me and some friends (who invested in crypto) do this when we are downloading a movie, or waiting for another friend on friday nights. It was really fun in december, but nowadays we are bored of it.
