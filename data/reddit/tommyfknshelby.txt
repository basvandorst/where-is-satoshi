wowsers its falling fast
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:02:14
Sweet thanks mate will check it out.
I was curious as to what amount of money you would worry about storing in a wallet? I only got in with $300 to see what happens in the coming months.
Is hardware wallet an actual piece of additional hardware or just me using external storage? Total noob questions

@_date: 2017-08-15 09:27:38
Thanks for your reply too! :)
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:11:36
great thanks.
the transferring from coinbase to btcmarkets .. i take it incurs some type of fee but otherwise it's just swapping it between online wallets?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:40:13
Do you find it more cost effective to buy elsewhere and transfer...? 
Is GST applied on every buy and sell?
Is GST applied on transferred in/out?

Just told my wife this story... then started explaining Bitcoin and she goes "well this is boring.. just tell me in a few years like that guy did"
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:00:19
Opinions? 
Have we seen the correction? 
Do you expect the major alts to follow btc down?
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:23:24
Thank you!
Follow ups.. 
I have used the words account and address i terchangeably. These are not one and the same?
If the heirarchy is wallet - account - sub account - address.. why would i want more than one address for a single account or sub accounts for that matter ?
Your term legacy Bitcoin ... Does this refer to pre fork? Or pre segwit?
Edit.. spelling
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:25:14
oh shit i needed that laugh!
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:19:52
n00b q. can you back up the same coin to more than 1 hardware wallet? or you have multiple so you can spread your risk?
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:58:02
As far as i understood though.. it will only be able to get to 2mb at the moment?
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:47:32
I'm excited to be a part of the ride. Jumped on the wagon with a small $300. Lets do this ��

@_date: 2017-08-22 07:43:13
What website do you use to monitor difficulty and hashing power?
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:15:12
Google sorted that out for me. I don't think I'm ready to spend $150 to look after $300 just yet
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:46:55
Thanks mate
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:21:29
a seer walks among us!!!
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:27:02
So it's just words? Does the hardware wallet keep anything else? What if the hardware wallet fails?
Could i not just write it down on paper a few times?
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:35:08
I panicked, and sold my bch
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:22:45
Coin should be SGC or SG1
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:54:21
Wrong outlook. Won't be selling Bitcoin for anything. Will be paying with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:01:19
The thing that gets me fucked off is from all this bullshit 100s of thousands of people were planning around it and poof, most of us get fucked. 
Imaging how much money they made trading before and after their cancelling s2x news. Fucking horrific.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:00:43
I like how you did this in your socks
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:04:24

From what I've read - I havent done further research and i dont know what the fuck to believe today but it is significant because its on a korean exchange with no trading fees
So afaik they are just spamming back and forth to increase the volume
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:29:45

People transferring into btc small amounts each week? What strategy are you using to avoid losing significant portions on fees?
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:54:20
Great choice!
Now for me to visit the Netherlands again so I can come an show my support!
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:50:01
You my friend are a legend.
Been reading for a couple of weeks and you've filled some gaps in my head thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:58:09
Haha yeah and I can ask Google in the car on Android auto what the price of BTC is
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:02:43
Yeah I member
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:28:39
In a hard fork scenario.. where we have a chain split like the bct bch.. did everyone end up with equal number of coins on both chains hence increasing your wealth or do you choose..? What happens to those on an exchange?
Is Byzantium a chain split for eth? What will happen?
Edit. Spelling
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:16:14
Until 3 or 4 years later.... ��
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:00:13
I'd go the common 'B bitcoin' logo under your numbers.. its probably the most well known and will look legit like a proper sponsor on proper jerseys. The other stuff you have their is a bit ott imo haha.
The other stuff is also not as clear. To people who don't know alot about Bitcoin.. without the word Bitcoin they probably won't make the association of the logo to what it actually is and maybe think it's a logo to do with you and your buddies. Think about the target logo.. mc Donald's M, KFC colonel.. without widespread exposure we'd never know what they were without the text next to them.
Send some pics when you decide and get them!

I'm waiting for my ledger but want to get my coins off the exchanges.. is there a soft version of ledger? Any recommendations with the upcoming BTG fork
