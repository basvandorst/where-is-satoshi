Yep. I sold at 6600 and bought back at 5880. Not too bad!

So we need a meme fork?

You can zoom out. It doesn't have to be edge-to-edge.

Exactly lol. I had some BTC back when they were around $300 and spent it. Saw it hit $3,000 and was pretty surprised but figured it would crash. Finally bought in at $5,200 and more at $$5,700.. I've made about $150 so far lol. Unfortunately don't have the disposable income to just drop in BTC, and I don't want to drop my savings in with the fork coming up.

Something to keep in mind (though I don't fully understand it) I'd that sometime in November there is something called a "Fork" taking place and a lot of exchanges are possibly switching to alternative coin, so, to my understanding, it is safer to keep your BTC in a wallet, such as electrum or a hardware wallet, so that those exchanges don't convert your BTC to some other alternative coin. So definitely be aware of that in the coming days. I need to read up on it more.

**TL;DR:** Most common reason people buy and sell currency on GDAX over the Coinbase website, even though they are owned by the same company (Coinbase), is that trading through GDAX costs significantly less in fees. Coinbase is for convenience, GDAX can be intimidating to people with limit and stop purchases. 
No worries! GDAX is in fact owned by Coinbase. The difference is that Coinbase is primarily used to quickly and easily buy BTC, ETH, and LTC with little hassle. The only thing with using the Coinbase website is that the fees for buying and selling crypto currency is quite high. From this point forward, when I refer to Coinbase I will be referring to the website, not the company as a whole. 
You can very easily and **instantaneously** transfer your funds from Coinbase to GDAX because they are owned by the same company, and that transfer can be done for **free**. Then, when you buy cryptocurrency on GDAX, if you set a **buy offer** for **below market price** and your offer is accepted, you pay **no fees** at all. If you **sell** your currency for **higher than the market price**, you again pay **no fees**. Even if you buy the current for market price you only pay a 0.3% fee or something like that.
Buying below and selling above market price is a **maker trade**, which means you **made** the market in that trade. You said what you would buy or sell your currency for, and once the currency dropped to that value and your buy offer is accepted, or the currency rises and sells at your list price, you effectively determined your currency's market value.
If you buy or sell currency **at market price**, that is a **taker trade** and that is when you have to pay the **taker fee** of 0.3%.
**Note:** Say you place an offer for BTC at $5,400 USD. You are performing a maker trade, however if BTC never dips down to $5,400 USD again, your buy offer will not be fulfilled and you will not receive any BTC. The same goes for selling, but in the opposite manner. Like you place a sell offer at $6,000 and, in the event BTC does not reach $6,000 in value, your trade, again, will not be fulfilled.
Hope this helps! There are plenty of videos on YouTube on how to use GDAX if you are interested.
**EDIT:** Clarification, some spelling, and moved TL;DR to the top of my novel.

you can transfer from Coinbase straight to GDAX. It is a lot faster to do so. Transactions between wallets and GDAX seem to take a long time based on my experience yesterday. Especially withdrawing.

One thing, though, with the upcoming BTC hard fork it seems to be recommended to keep your BTC in a wallet rather than an exchange. So if you do end up buying BTC soon, just be sure to move it to a wallet of some sort before the fork. It is supposed to happen sometime this November, though I don't have a definite date.

Right, it really isn't that bad. It just has a slight learning curve.
My pleasure!

Yeah it's confusing to me as well. I only just started investing in bitcoin and playing with low level trades. This is just what I've learned so far. It's such a crazy world lol

We've honestly more than likely watched the same videos. I just watched a few describing how GDAX (an exchange operated by Coinbase) works and really that's it. I haven't dedicated too too much time to this yet. I'm mostly planning to invest in and hodl bitcoin rather than try to do trades.
