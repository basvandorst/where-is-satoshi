It’s all about the long game, bro. Invest only what you can afford to lose here.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:07:55
They are known to push bCash as Bitcoin, which it’s not, because they both have the same owner, Roger Ver. It’s disingenuous and fraudulent.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:49
K. See ya.

If they beat Coinbase/GDAX to Segwit and promptly implement LN, they’ll destroy them.

Bitcoin isn’t the S&amp;P 500. Get out.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:39:20
This ain’t down. We’re up over 1500% this year. I’ll consider shaking in my boots when we lose that much. You can sell now if you want.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:06:02
You’re a joke
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:23:09
Neither. Swing and day trading is dumb luck. There’s a reason managed funds almost always lose.

ADDRESSES, not wallets. But assuming I had my BTC in one address, then it’s none of your business :P.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:56:36
Is that Bitcoin.com? Are you here to push fake bitcoin, because we’re not interested?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:08:49
Yup, they ghetto rigged it instead of doing a proper fix.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:19:36
LOL, good one ��
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:51:06
No prob. Good luck!

Yeah it’s okay to have some risky assets if you’ve got a beta youre okay with for your portfolio as a whole
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:46
Are you setting your own fees and using Segwit? If not, you’re doing it wrong. I’ve never had fees as high as you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:33:55
Take a look at the last year. We’re up over 1500%. Go home. You’re drunk. Your IRA do that well this year? Your fiat do that well this year? Your gold?

No, I just don’t give a fuck if you’re scared. Sell your bitcoin. Do it. The rest of us will buy it up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:18:07
It doesn’t. Electrum only supports real bitcoin.

I can recommend and have used Electrum as a software wallet and Ledger Nano S as a hardware wallet. I kept everything in Electrum until I got my Ledger. Hardware wallets are going to be more secure.

Bitcoin.com is bitcoin cash. They’re scammers. Don’t support them.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:17:27
No prob. I wasn’t trying to be mean. We get a lot of fake FUD in here. Good on you for leaving bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:12:00
No. TA is retarded for stocks, and it’s more retarded for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:43:21
Lol, I dare y’all to short bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:34
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:59:49
And that wallet is? Only a bCash shill or a scammed noob would use bitcoin.com.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:25:59
You shouldn’t mess with bCash, but ledger supports some altcoins if you’re going to go ahead and do it anyhow, plus it’s hardware.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:16:55
How so? What if eBay held the BTC in escrow until receipt of item or a certain number of days, whichever comes first?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:35:26
Get out. The door is that way.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:04:36
That applies the same to the USD
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:00:51
Nah, alt-right can shove it up their ignorant butts. PSA: Bitcoin isn’t for y’all; it isn’t racist.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:05
Yeah, I know what you mean. Thanks on the name. I thought it was all right haha.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:30:06
In a certain sense, I suppose. But in another, no; you can see every transaction. You just might not be able to trace it to a person.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:35:18
Nobody cares
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:28:52
I didn’t do the math, but you mean addresses not wallets, no? That’s different. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:45:34
If you have capital gains (likely), then yes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:30:13
Whatever dude 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:23:07
Yes, I sold my bCash and so should everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:51:45
Good on you dude
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:53
Lol. Go ahead and sell. This is normal for anyone in bitcoin for a minute.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:32:40
Schwab bank is a good bank. You’ll probably have to okay the first few transfers flagged as fraud or something but after that you should be good. They’re the best bank I’ve worked with period.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:33:25
Short term, maybe it’ll work. Long term, not a chance. Go back to r/btc.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:26:17
You retards say this shit after every correction. Shove it up your ass and wait and see. Maybe you’re right, but honestly nobody can predict the future. Sell if you’re scared. Nobody cares.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:42:35
No. You’re wrong. They’re both backed by the people who use it and believe it has value. They’re both completely useless otherwise. If people stop believing USD has value, then poof it’s value is gone. Same for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:15
You’re playing the game wrong. Just jump in the deep end if you’re gonna do it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:46:32
I had some BTC buys earlier today go through fine, although a little slow. I suspect they didn’t anticipate having to do this, just got overloaded.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:50:10
Dump it
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:47:55
I think I saw a notice re: delayed transactions today. They’re probably backlogged.

@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:55
Dude, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Also, I think this is temporary but do whatever you want. It’s your money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:00:36
A wallet only you control
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:43
I see no reason for alarm. We all know bitcoin is capable of exponential growth, and I think it’s still undervalued. Sure, some people might sell soon, and we’ll have ourselves a little dip, but it’ll go back up. Business as usual, bro.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:25:59
Dude is just making shit up like everyone else with a prediction
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:07:52
You’re a stupid ass post
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:05:10
You’re wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:06:33
Don’t 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:40:58
It’s Bcash’s website, and they advertise Bcash as Bitcoin, which it’s not. Bitcoin.org is where it’s at.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:11:16
No. We should not stoop to their level.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:13:46
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:15:07
I’m sorry, man. You got Bitcoin Cash scammed. Bitcoin Cash (bCash) isn’t Bitcoin. It’s some fake alt coin trying to piggy back on bitcoin’s name.
Electrum is a real bitcoin wallet. You can’t send bCash to it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:45:16
I sold my free bCash and bought more real bitcoin. There are places you can trade/sell bCash for other alts, but unfortunately I can’t recommend one because I don’t use one. Maybe someone else can help you out with a review.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:59:56
Don’t panic if you lose some money initially. Think long term.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:07:29
Impossible to say, but you could assume BTC sitting for a lonnng time is lost, but that assumption could be wrong
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:14:36

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:03:24
They aren’t that bad, and they’re getting better. I suspect you’re not doing it right. Are you using Segwit and setting your own fee?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:53:46
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:15:48
I think it’s because you’re giving them unsolicited investment advice. That screams scam. Don’t do it. Imagine if someone did that to you about something you’ve never heard of.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:06:58
Their tech is bad, and everyone knows it. They’re not even decentralized.

I’ll bring it in for you. bCash is a centralized shitcoin trying to use bitcoin’s name to gain recognition, make money for its owners, and scam people like OP.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:05:35
Everyone else has said it. It’s easy to find where they went, hard to find who has them. Identities usually only become available when the addresses connect or can be traced to something outside of the blockchain, e.g., a sell and withdrawal of fiat to a bank on an exchange, which is then traceable to an individual or company.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:25:25

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:59:08
They’ll be moving soon. See Fork.lol. Basically, we lost a lot of miners to Bcash because it was more profitable for a bit, but it’s not anymore. If profit is their incentive, they’re coming back to bitcoin now. Stay patient, and don’t be suckered into jumping ship.

You should keep enough liquid cash for an emergency and invest the rest keeping in mind your taste for risk. Bitcoin is volatile and therefore risky, that is, it has high upside and downside potential. I tend to believe in its upside potential, as does everyone in this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:21:24
Hey dude. If you’re looking for a software wallet, I’d recommend Electrum.
Here is a good resource on wallets: 
Stay away from bitcoin.com. Have fun. Stay safe.

Slow but working for me. I’m buying as we dip.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:57:48
That’s how markets work. It goes up, then down, then up, etc. Focus on long term trends. Or don’t, I don’t care. Also it’s not that low; we’ve gained more on single days than it has dropped today. Nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:36:15
You want no fees? This post is a FUD joke then? There is no such thing as a free lunch. Stop being cheap and pay the fees. Bitcoin doesn’t work without them.

Lol it’s not overvalued
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:29
That’s not so bad. That’s less than the current ATH, which we’re gonna break once the weak hands sell this dip.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:26:44
No, beyond the possibility of some kids panic selling for no reason and creating a temp fire sale

If true, how is it an enforceable policy? Are they going to make everyone converting fiat to fiat prove it didn't at one time derive from BTC? Also, what's the big deal, just keep in BTC or use another country's fiat?

Others can try, sure, but it is only to the country’s detriment. I sympathize with the people of Russia who will lose out on the economic benefits Bitcoin could bring. Competent leadership will want Bitcoin; I’m not concerned about the majority of the world. It brings money and jobs to the people and taxes to the Government. Countries only lose by banning bitcoin. Regulation can be reasonable. Banning is stupid.
Edit: I don’t think Russia is going to ban anything. I’ll believe it when I see it.

Why not? It has value, and that value is likely to increase, IMO. Even if you immediately convert it to fiat, you still make money. It’s stupid not to accept it.

People will either buy stuff with it or sell it/exchange it for something the else. Those holding now aren't selling or spending because they believe the market is undervaluing the currency; once the market catches up, there is no reason to hold.

If true, how is it an enforceable policy? Are they going to make everyone converting fiat to fiat prove it didn't at one time derive from BTC? Also, what's the big deal, just keep in BTC or use another country's fiat?

Econ 101. Once the price of bitcoin becomes high enough to part with it, people will begin to sell or use it. The market is currently undervaluing bitcoin, so people hold until someone is willing to give them what they feel it’s worth.

Electrum is on Mac OS. It’s a good option as far as software wallets go. A hardware wallet would be more secure: Ledger and Trezor are popular, but you’re not really “storing bitcoin on Mac” at that point.

Stop the FUD (not necessarily you, OP). Yes, always put BTC in a wallet YOU control, but you should have done that BEFORE any speculation about Coinbase and Segwit2x. Always control your coins! The truth is we don’t know what Coinbase is going to do, so stop spreading worst case scenario claims as true.

Word. Just don’t tell people about your investments. Money talk is a no no. People need to make their own decisions about their money. Edit: This is like Emily Post 101, no?

It could go up; people might demand more fiat to compensate for the risks of engaging in illegal activity, although it’s hard to predict.

This correct, but don’t use an exchange to send bitcoin, except to get it off the exchange and into your own wallet. Send your payments from a wallet that lets you choose the fee.

And probably subject you to double taxation, at least in the United States (first on fiat earned used to purchase BTC and second on value earned from BTC holding). I’ll pass until the blockchain caucus pushes that legislation through Congress.

In the US, it’s not yet treated like a foreign currency. You pay capital gains tax every time there is a realization event, such as buying something. So, someone in the US first pays income tax on their fiat, then they pay capital gains tax on a purchase with bitcoin (hence the “double taxation”). In summary, buying with BTC and replacing with fiat is going to cost US persons more in tax than just buying with fiat.
Edit: It might possibly make sense to do this, tax wise, if you’re looking at capital losses, but most with BTC holdings are not.
