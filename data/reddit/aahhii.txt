Who knows, there aren't nearly enough details to answer this.
If I had to venture a guess though, I would say that they would probably make it so the existing trading workflow is the same so from  the end user POV, the only thing to change would be the decrease in settlement time.
My guess is they're only using the blockchain to store a record and they're going to have a small set of private keys, under heavy security, which they use to make small transfers in order to record transactions (or groups of transactions) on the block chain.  In addition, they may maintain their own copy of the blockchain in order to do lookups down the road.  They'll probably store a lot of the transaction info in their own databases, but use the blockchain directly when building things like reports for auditors or if their own copy of data is lost/damaged for some reason.
tl;dr - **Who the fuck knows?**

Oh, but they do. Despite what everyone likes to think, placating financial auditors is a pain in the ass and the sole bread and butter for a lot of bean counters. Even at non-financial companies, any company that has to bill (thousands of transactions/day)+ are constantly faced with scaling unscalable workflows in order to just prove to the government that they aren't being ripped off and prove to their users/customers that they aren't ripping them off either.


You're on point there, but I would make two counter-points:
* The transactions don't need to be done in real time to be a huge improvement.  If you sell a stock on eTrade today, it takes 3 fucking days to get your money.  What they're proposing here will drop it to less than 1 day.  Why does it take so long?  Because someone who isn't an idiot needs to look through these transactions and manually give them a seal of approval.
* Keep in mind that one trade would not be one transaction on the block chain.  Chances are, they're going to batch as many trades as they can into each blockchain transaction.  I'm guessing they're going to be putting some sort of message on the blockchain.  That message doesn't need to be human readable.

Also, from your comment history it appears as though you run a bitcoin ATM business in Atlanta.  Did you get a license?  If so - what kind?  The closest thing I could find based off of research into my state is getting a license to operate as a currency exchange.

But Zerocoin is open source (like bitcoin).  So if it picks up steam, will bitcoin devs simply grab whatever makes zerocoin unique and just bake it into bitcoin?
And even though it is off topic, I'd like to point out that having a publicly maintained ledger (a la bitcoin blockchain) is not necessarily a bad thing.  Even though I think there are a lot of situations where the transactions you do are no one's damned business, a lot of transactions where you would want this and it is to the best interest of both parties involved to have a record of the transactions they make.  **tl;dr - while having private transactions would be useful having public ones is useful too**

@_date: 2013-11-17 22:56:59
The problem with what you're saying is that you're treating bitcoin as currency instead of money.
Bitcoin as a currency is hard to work and may not happen.  But as a form of money, Bitcoin makes a lot of sense.  If you're doing a very large international transaction (buy 100,000 gallons of Oil from mideast or 2,000 pairs of leather boots from Italy) then bitcoin is an EXTREMELY easy way to cut out the high fees of the middle man.
Even if all bitcoin ever does is "Forex &gt; Bitcoin transfer &gt; Forex" it will still be useful for facilitating the international economy.

I'm wondering if the drop could be due to Americans not placing BTC buy bids since they were stuffing their faces with turkey and a large amount of btc sell bids coming from the increase in places accepting bitcoin in time for Bitcoin black friday.  Both logical and could explain a drop in price but are both ultimately good for BTC and will cause the price to increase.

Jewelry originates around the same time humans evolved speech.  It is like an upvote that you wear; showing you're doing something to contribute to the group.  If everyone has the same shit then you can't prove you're better so you look for something more rare; and gold fits the bill.
TL;DR - We value gold since it is the path of least resistance to blow jobs.  Lots and lots of blow jobs.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:55:20
I wouldn't be surprised if it went either way.  Since every bank in the US is FDIC insured I'm sure there is some stipulations on certain situations in which the banks are required to grant accounts to people in order to be FDIC insured and able to operate in the US.
Obvious examples of this would be race/religion/etc but I'm thinking there could be other requirements in there too.

While I'm no Satoshi, my 0.000002506 btc is that saying bitcoin will become the exclusive form of value store is like saying the internet will become the exclusive form of communication.

Don't fault them for simply being speculators.  A lot of people don't care about gold either but they buy it like crazy whenever the fed has a money-gasm and buys bad bonds like nobody's business.
Speculating is a natural and important part of the economy.  Who knows - maybe because of what you're doing right now your friends/family will go on to lead illustrious careers as commodities traders.
I personally subscribe to your point of view and see this going far so I probably won't even sell if the price is back under $50.  That being said it takes all types so as long as you've looked them stone cold in the eyes and let them know that speculating can make them poor as fast as it can make them rich then let them do what makes them happy and don't treat them differently for it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:33:29
"Long enough"???
In its ~4 years of existence it is challenging strongly held notions of the form and purpose of currency for the last 200-1000 years (depending on the point in history you attribute the rise of FIAT).
If that only took 4 years then why would it be so unreasonable that a different form of money could quickly overtake bitcoin; especially since the code is on github and all it takes is a single or small group of competent developers and a small group of people who buy into it to grow a competitor?

Your entire argument is that if you use bitcoin then you're endorsing libertarianism whether you like it or not.  Well, you're using the internet so by your logic you're endorsing government funded programs whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:15:31
That exact same argument WORD FOR WORD can be used against bitcoin.  Despite the libertarian ideals it was created with that certainly doesn't bind it to a predetermined future.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:13:20
Even if exchanges weren't functional or able to go BTC -&gt; FIAT (a scenario less and less likely by the day) there are plenty of other countries/demand which would hold the value of BTC up.  China has tremendous demand (it concerns me as a US citizen that they're more vested in btc than we are) and demand is healthy through Europe and Russia as well.
I'm sure banks will drag their feet if they can but the break neck speed at which other countries are adopting this will force them to sit down and take their medicine whether they like it or not.

"How many paper memos do you think are sent daily, compared to emails daily?"
My point wasn't about general usage; just exclusivity.  Whenever a new technology is coming to fruition people tend to overestimate how far it will go and the speed at which it will get there.

In group bias :P
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:12:21
I think this could be easily mitigated by what I'm suggesting:
1 - They allow people to cancel pre-orders if they don't deliver miner by promised date.
2 - They transfer ANY bitcoins mined while testing your unit to your wallet.
Both of these items are fair and would take the company out of the equation when making decisions on miner purchases.

Fucking hell - for 6000 btc I'll spin up a better forum than that and blow my dad.
In all seriousness, if the btc community needs a community driven forum then I'd be more than happy to spin up a stack exchange like site using something like OSQA/Askbot.
I'm a software engineer so if it took off I could do things like add functionality based on popularity of each request or possibly open source it the forum and just take changes from other devs as they get approved by the community.
If people are interested then I'll do - at least the first step - payable on delivery w/o asking for donations up front.  [PLEASE DON'T SEND COIN NOW].

It is a community for bitcoin. Any sub reddit is gong to have circle jerking going on regardless of the subject matter.  It is no different on reddit than if you go to a meet up IRL.  It is not specific to the bitcoin culture.  My Little Pony, Manga fans, Cubs fans, football fans...if you go to a forum for any of them (on the internet or IRL), circle jerking will be found.
It is your responsibility as a rational person to try and recognize it for yourself and adjust your world view accordingly.

So I'm guessing by now you've heard of Mt. Gox.  Mt Gox is frequented by newbies and people from the US.
BTC China (the main exchange for Chinese natives) does ~10% more volume than Mt.Gox and if you convert the current CNY/BTC to USD/BTC, the Chinese are almost always paying ~15% more than Mt Gox (which is insane when you consider that Mt Gox is already higher than most exchanges due to its popularity).
Basically, depending on how you do the numbers; the Chinese are spending %15-%30 more than everyone else for bitcoins.
Source: 
(NOTE:  I couldn't find a break down of BTC market cap by geography but I wouldn't be surprised if China was coming up on 50%). 
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:11:40
Bitcoin and the internet are both tools and it doesn't matter what ideals created them but how they're used.  I can take bitcoin and convert to FIAT to pay taxes and further the government just like you can hypothetically use the internet to attempt to organize a coup and weaken the governement.

@_date: 2013-12-02 03:12:35
Not by the same magnitude, just the same percentage.  For all we know,  the following could have played out:
* BTC is at a ~$12 billion market cap meaning relatively small waves could cause major price swings.
* Due to holidays in US, less people than usual were buying BTC on exchanges
* Due to bitcoin black Friday and recent increase in websites/bars/restaraunts accepting bitcoin, more people than usual were selling BTC
* Combining these two along could explain a drop in price which is ultimately good for bitcoin and doesn't have anything to do with a correction.
* A lot of people holding on to bitcoin are poor college kids who had nothing better to do on a Saturday night in 2009 and were sick of playing counter strike on the $3K computer they begged their parents for.  These people don't have the stomach to hold on through a down turn because they want to pay their tuition or buy a Mustang so that wicked hot chick in English class will give them the time of day. Given that $1000 USD/BTC is a good round number there is probably going to be a lot of profit taking to work through before the price can go further.  This would exacerbate any drop in price.  Institutional money from a Silicon Valley/Wall Street hard on should alleviate this problem over the next year.

I think Bitcoin is a paradigm shift; but I don't think it will be absolute.
Simply put, I think bitcoin will do to money what the internet did to communicating.  Did it make communicating easier?  Yes.  Do people still use older methods?  Overwhelmingly, yes.
Saying bitcoin will be used for every day purchases is like saying we will only talk to each other over the internet.  Possible? Yes, but even at today's break neck pace of innovation that isn't in the near future.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:06:34
I really thought about ordering a 2th from the feb batch, but the fact that they're completely ignoring this makes me uneasy:
I mean I get that doing anything with btc is a risk but just b/c there is a lot of money on the table it shouldn't give companies the right to keep breaking promises (namely delivery dates). It is one thing that they can't promise ROI (understandable), it is a completely different thing when mining companies are allowed to make whatever promise they want just b/c people are too desperate to take them to task on keeping their word.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:04:16
You're mixing in the context of bitcoin being a new but still underutilized investment with what its ultimate use will be if it is a success and volatility goes down.
If bitcoin is a success then - since it is a store of value - me using the bitcoin to buy FIAT is bad for you because the value of bitcoin goes down since the supply increases.  Even if the FIAT itself is subject to inflation that doesn't change the fact that the market capitalization of the FIAT goes up and the market capitalization of bitcoin goes down when I sell my bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:39:53


You say that lightly. I hear Governmentcoin and I envision "cryptocurrency which automatically levies a tax to fund the creation of an executive and military branch" and the chances of it giving bitcoin a "run for the money".  I don't advocate for that scenario but I wouldn't write it off.

Also, this is a great read (  )
The section "Availability heuristic" is relevant because it talks about how the Chinese may be more apt to adopt bitcoin since the impact of high inflation during the 80s/90s had on their economy.  Even though Americans have had their own bouts with inflation; we haven't had any period where people lost everything because of it or their life savings has been rendered worthless by it.
