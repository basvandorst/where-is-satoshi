That's why it's important to have a disciplined investment strategy, both on deploying capital as you scale up your position as well as your return targets on how you cash out. Keeping an allocation long term ride or die, versus the allocation you will sell on the way up to lock in profits can help you win on both ends. Discipline does not require luck.

Bitcoin is flying, best let the excitement simmer down. Throw down hard on ethereum which is staying flat, and when the vol on btc cools then you will have your chance to buy in. Eth has strong news and partnerships growing daily which I don't think is being priced in because it's being overshadowed by the btc wave. 
You don't want to be the guy that buys in at 4k, it drops to 3k and you get weak in the knees and sells and then it jumps back up. This happened to a ton of people in the last run up in the last few months. 
There is a fork coming in btc in November and just like the last one, there will be an irrational price drop that you will be able to buy in at. 
I would go 3k in ethereum and 1k in litecoin right now, and set up weekly autobuys for eth ltc and bitcoin for about 100 each. Any drops of 10% be ready to buy in heavy til you can deploy the rest of your capital.
That's how I would play it.

Understandable, but your institution and its practices are the utter opposite of the idea behind a decentralized blockchain, so it is a different mentality we are all up against. IMHO, people should be free to split the chain as many times as they want with as many upgrades as they see fit. The network is smart and people will vote with their feet, and the useless forks will die or become obsolete. You can't have freedom and decentralization without having faith that the people will ultimately decide what's best for themselves and the network.

The price dropped happened pre fork before consensus among the factions was clear. Look up price movements early to mid july. Major drop because the community was still 50/50. Then BIP 98 locked in, the community consolidated (other than Jihan and the bcash crew) and rallied through the actual fork and continued to rally post fork that we see today.

It's an early industry, if you believe in bitcoin and cryptos and blockchain, instead of just dumping in your life savings, everyone can help build business commerce and build value that brings more people into a blockchain based economy!

A little advice on how to hodl in 3 steps.
1.Know how much money you are literally prepared to spend or essentially throw away
2. Read all you can to determine if you truly believe in the future and potential of the blockchain 
3. Set a long term price target, buy in, and be willing to hold until it gets there or lose it all. 
If bitcoin goes to 100k in 10 years, it won't matter if you bought at 2k, 2800 or 4k. Protect your coin, hodl strong and sleep well. 
Otherwise you'll be busy losing money while you buy at the high and keep selling at the low.

Great post. My trading thoughts as I've deployed 10k since march similarly:
Volatility is too high for that strategy. I would adjust to calculate a moving average st dev. And then every time it drops 1stdev, (or .5stdev if you want to deploy capital faster) then buy a set dollar amount of coin (eth/btc/ltc). Possibly would suggest 1 eth, .1btc, 5ltc.  on top of that, at the end of each week buy a set dollar of each coin. I personally view parity between btc/eth is a price of 2000/200. If one drops dramatically below the other then I would buy more of the relatively cheaper coin.  If you are a true believer in the LONG GAME, keep buying on disciplined intervals and only keep your ear to the ground for news that you think will be the end of blockchain... and until Then, sleep easy as we go long &amp; strong.
Would love to hear others trading strategies.

2 years when it's at 10k, you won't remember this volatility, and if you pussed out now, then somewhere between 3k and 10k your gonna buy less coin with more money and be upset about your previously weak stomach. Buy more to lower your cost basis and tighten up those abs.

If cryptos become what we believe they have the potential to be... there is no exit strategy because there will be no need to exit

I think this is an overly simplistic view. Way before banks even think about switching to crypto currencies, liquidity in this market will have grown sunstantially, especially in the derivatives markets including swaps, pairs and other currency hedging mechanisms that banks will undoubtedly employ. They would hedge away and even profit over the crypto arbitrage well before they would be taking this type of currency risk on their lending portfolio. 
Having banks trading cryptos along with their other forex positions will only help easw the volatility because banks will be trying to arb eachother when currency pairs get out of line.

It's not structured to replace equity, it's either a currency or a commodity. It behaves on supply, demand, and trust not some expectation of future earnings or DCF. Banks get into darker markets faster and better then most give them credit. As banks enter it will actually calm down the volatility as they will be hedging and betting to arbitrage against too wild of price swings, they will bring more liquidity and they will bring it to retail markets where they will compete by bringing down transaction fees. They compete for pennies on razor thin margins and still make billions on roughly efficient markets. They are seeing this inefficient and new market and salivating.

Money like the USD is not backed by gold. The gold standard was a long, long time ago. The dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States federal govt, controlled by the central bank called the federal reserve. They print and destroy money to control the money supply. The big pro about bitcoin is that it's value comes from  true market economics of supply and demand, taking out the uncertainty to participants who are weary of how govt can meddle with our finances.

What happened today? Did the segwit BIP get blocked into reality(80% for x successful blocks)? Anyone know the best way I can look it up myself?
Sorry to all the cold feet sellers at 1800!
