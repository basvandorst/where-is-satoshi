It looks like it didn't take Crypto more than 100 minute to cross $176 B mark after you put a challenge of 100 years :)

Let's hope we got beyond $200B market cap with this rally.
I am more into market cap than ATH for now as high market cap implies new money coming into the system. We need new money in the system.

hope we do! it would be a sign that we are getting new money in the system. Getting tired of money movement from alt to bitcoin and then bitcoin to alt.

But you missed one detail.
Bitcoin ( the technology of trust netwrok) have potential to do to amazon what amazon did to sears/walmart or to retail..

Okay. Makes sense. Agree on this point. 
Money could keep flowing from Alt to Bitcoin and vice versa, but we all should be keep looking for new money getting into the system.

People who have power and they are getting benefit out of the centralization of power would always fight decentralization as long as they can.
Majority of folks who don't have power - and they are the big majority, are still skeptical about it. But I believe with time they all would see the benefit of the decentralization technology.

I see where you are coming from, but I don't agree with this kind of skepticism at all.
When Internet came, it helped in the distribution of poronography , it doesn't mean that it did only that. You can see how it is helping the world now.
