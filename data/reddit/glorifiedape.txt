The CRL isn't checked automatically with curl/OpenSSL.
CRL: CRL means "Certificate Revocation List" and is used to check to see if any certificates in the server's chain have been revoked for some reason. If automatic, then the engine will automatically download a CRL and use it to evaluate the trust of the server's certificate chain when performing the TLS handshake. If manual, then the engine will not automatically use a CRL, but you can provide one that has been downloaded separately by using the CURLOPT_CRL option. If no, then the CURLOPT_CRL option will be ignored.

Application developers, in general, are not plumbers. They are general contractors. The amazing thing about HTTP and the web is that despite its complexity, it's remarkably forgiving to people that mistakenly think it's simple. I don't think the web would have been as successful without that. The barrier to entry is extremely low with the web. Transaction malleability was a weakness in the bitcoin protocol.
