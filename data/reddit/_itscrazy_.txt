My biggest holding is indeed FML

Bitmex is the biggest Mexican exchange ��

Who in their right mind thinks that it would only take 9 years for mass adoption and FIAT replacement?? Oh well, impatient crypto people I guess

If light can't escape it, my money certainly can't

But sending money from the USA to Malaysia with super low fees, no middlemen and in 5 minutes is.

With banks what's wrong is that it will take several days and I would pay quite big fees. With PayPal, they once locked my account for no good reason, so yeah. Regarding the TPS, 2nd layer transactions will solve that.

The 70 billion market cap of bitcoin, doesn't actually mean that there are 70 billion USD invested in Bitcoin...

Actually that's a specific advertisement for Covesting.

It's amazing how many people in crypto seem to know what the fuck is going to happen next ��
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:42:59
So bitcoin will end after 2100. Cool

Pound-backed crypto? Ahaha I think it should be BTC backing the pound
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:40:52
In my case, typo :)

How could Bitcoin be stable with a market cap of say 20 billion? If at the current market cap it's easy to manipulate, imagine with a much lower one.... There will always be buyers and sellers in a much unregulated market (for now). For bitcoin's price to be stable, the market cap must be way higher. Not lower.

The thing is that if you ask the people which manufactured polystation if it is the real Playstation, they will will tell you it isn't.. Bcash CEO on the other hand...

Maybe you should stick to fundamentals to help you choose your "side" and not some subreddit...

BCash is just the scammy computer store next door...
