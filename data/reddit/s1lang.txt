May I have an invite please? 
Thank you 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:23:49
A new home?
You'll be able to buy an Island with those one day :D
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:17:49
Lmao,  an IT Crowd classic! 
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:13:11
These are beautiful thank you.
I've purchased one and sent you a message at the checkout screen for Intl. Shipping
Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:33:38
Happy Tuesday :) 
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:41:38
Fantastic! Thank you. 
This has now convinced me to finally buy one
@_date: 2014-07-30 10:35:23
Do you guys ship to the UK, if so what is the cost?
Thank you
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:22:37
Please give mine to the charity :) 
Thank you
@_date: 2015-04-10 08:35:04
Oh no, I knew he died. 
But didn't realise it was potentially related to that :(
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:52:59
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:31:31
Well played :D

Good afternoon everyone.
This article was meant to portray more about my Digital Forensic Company offering Bitcoin wallet recovery services and being probably the first company of this nature accepting Bitcoins as payment.
The headline and bulk of the story does not portray the way I hoped this article would go.
It definitely wasn't the fact of me "losing" $50,000 as I strongly believe that I haven't lost anything.
I originally started out in Bitcoin as a hobby and an interest, and hoped this article would show Bitcoin in a positive light.
@_date: 2013-10-15 15:42:13
Good to see VMC finally getting a mention on an article
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:29:30
Yifu who was famously caught out on multiple occasions "ripping" off his customers is on this board?
Lead by example, this is not!
@_date: 2013-10-09 14:19:32
Give Authy a go, it's fantastic :)
Plus it backs them all up to their secure server too.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:08:42
Fantastic explanation, I second Elux on his suggestion too.
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:26:40
Thank you Fjordo.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:25:44
I just purchased my first gold, thank you :D
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:08:55
Thank you ever so much for replying.
I look forward to using your services
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:27:28
Thank you, I should have actually mentioned the important part.
@_date: 2013-08-12 09:15:19
Yes please No_2, that would be fantastic.
We will be adding a Bitcoin Payment system for Private individuals who require any type of Data Recovery (Bitcoin, Handsets, Computers etc.) as well as a whole Bitcoin Recovery section.
Due to the nature of our work we don't like to advertise our physical location, however please feel free to add us to the map in the Stoke-on-Trent area.
Stickers would be great too as I can use these at Conferences and Corporate events in which we attend and present.
Quite a few of us in the office are keen Bitcoin advocates and users and those that aren't just don't know it yet, but I'm working on it :)
Thank you again
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:48:23
If this was priced and paid for in Bitcoins, as well as possibly being backed by a known party then I definitely would!
@_date: 2013-10-07 08:39:39
Please drop me a message, I have one due to be shipped in the coming days, I can transfer it to you if you like?
I'm not going to be making the most of it so I would rather sell it to help the network properly.
@_date: 2013-08-12 10:13:54
And you, thank you for taking the time to help out our community.
@_date: 2013-12-25 16:03:28
Wow. Thank you, this is my first received tip on Reddit, as well as my first Dogecoin, thank you and merry Christmas :D
@_date: 2013-10-07 17:35:33
Has anybody used this before?
It looks interesting
@_date: 2013-08-09 16:11:08
Our company SYTECH take Bitcoins.
We specialise in Digital Forensics and Data Recovery. 
This comes in extremely handy for lost, deleted or corrupted Bitcoin Wallets from any device. If passwords have been lost or forgotten we can assist in its recovery.
The website is currently being redesigned with a section specifically for Bitcoin "Recovery" and Payment.
Feel free to get in touch, we offer a 5% discount for Bitcoin payments.
Thank you for compiling this list.
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:31:42
I got a fireproof lockbox from them through Amazon for my paperwallet.
It arrived the very next day at no extra cost!
I'm definitely going to use them again, thank you guys.
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:18:43
Mine does too, I've just emailed to query this.
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:19:40
I'd very much be interested in this too
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:03:06
Use a bank transfer through localbitcoins. 
It's almost instantaneous :-D
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:55:27
It's back up now :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:04:54
I am of this opinion too
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:53:33
This looks great.
Good luck :-D
@_date: 2013-09-06 19:55:12
For our International colleagues here's a link to The Chase "Fanny Chmelar" incident:
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:43:21
Oh yes to this too please
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:06:35
This is what I use on there :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:02:39
Thank you for the detailed reply Wayne, I really appreciate it.
I'll have to look into that then.
 I've always wanted to learn python so this will be the perfect reason to :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:11:04
Yes it's Goat.
He recently sold a very rare physical bitcoin for approx $1,000,000!
Good on him!
@_date: 2013-08-13 16:04:15
I think that may be the BTCGarden IPO funds being returned to BTC-TC
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:39:01
I have submitted this to BestOf - Thank you for being so generous!
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:59:18
Extremely slow though...
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:55:38
It's back up now :)
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:24:11
If you're there in September, we'll come and see you :-D
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:08:27
Wow. 
Oh no, in my excitement that he had actually posed for a picture I couldn't think of a witty dog/bitcoin cooment, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:42:57
Yes please :D
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:20:58
I love it!
How much are you charging buddy? 
I'm only up the road.
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:05:40
This is exactly my thinking too, and I have complete faith it will surpass the original high again.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:52:16
Hi, just a quick question whilst you're on here.
Does this work with .co.UK sites such as Amazon and eBay?
Thank you
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:25:47
I definitely agree with what you are saying.
I just know what people are like from a day to day viewpoint, whereby they will always use the same username and password for all their sites no matter what they're told.
@_date: 2013-06-17 11:28:58
Thank you
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:37:09
I met the owners at the last Manchester Bitcoin meetup.
It was good meeting you guys and well done for getting it publicised. 
I hope it brings you lots more business!

@_date: 2013-04-18 19:03:29
Because I didn't write the article, I was simply quoting the losing portion of their headline.
We discussed how much I invested, how much it was worth at the peak etc.
