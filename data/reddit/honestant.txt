Why is it not rising dramatically anymore, then? 
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:40:11
Are you naive or just stupid?

You don't know?
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:29:55
Then it crashes to absolutely nothing, nobody takes it as form of payment. It's useless. GG?
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:46:14
Just something to have on home screen that self updates and looks nice and uses Stamp

...this doesn't make any sense

He has no claim to his coins at all. He was supporting Silk Road with his sales, he's lucky he isn't behind bars right now.
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:30:06
Then it crashes to $0.05, GG?
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:29:54
They still aren't.

What about if I'm a 99 cent store? Selling an item will cost me 10% of its total value? (Assuming person only buys 1 item) That sounds like a lot, and it sounds like it wouldn't work for places that do small transactions. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 06:07:07
Bitcoin will be worth a hundred within a week. Save my comment for when I'm right. 
BTW, Bitcoin is still the future I just dont want you guys to be poor. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:38:24
So like Runescape or WOW money? Yeah, sure. You could.

I don't have a credit card, but I have linked it to my bank account.
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:16:39
I just did it with Crazyfinger's instructions. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-01-26 07:49:52
Just fine, Bitcoin is still crashing hard
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:03:51
Can I choose to pay nothing?
When I send money using the blockchain iPhone app, it doesn't ask me how much I want to pay. Is it by default taking some from me? If so, how much is it taking from me?
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:42:56
You don't NEED shoes to traffic drugs on Silk Road, but you do need Bitcoins or some form of cash.
@_date: 2014-01-21 14:18:24
This is simply not true. I recently sold Bitcoin to coinbase and it takes roughly 6 business days
@_date: 2014-01-17 01:12:18
I do have one. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:55:50
No...do you even know how banks work?
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:08:08
Where are you located?
I'm in the U.S and I can see it under a guest account. I have no idea why the OP is getting downvoted, just a bunch of haters.
@_date: 2014-01-15 07:01:16
Wait, I thought sending Bitcoins was free? If they charge you, how is this different than Visa?
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:20:29
More like your car. Gtfo.

What graph did I provide?
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:50:37
Yup, and now we're at 759.57. Told you guys to abort.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:26:28
I do, and you don't.

Yea! FUCK LOGIC.

|Tech savvy reasons
I would think it'd be quite the opposite. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:02:05
Honestly I sound like a crackpot, I think it'll be in the millions. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:46:04
yeah, whats left of it
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:53:37
Yes, but you're comparing apples (A baby cryptocurrency) and oranges (An established behemoth, paper money). You're comparing BTC, a baby in 2010-2013, with USD which has been established as the most reliable currency out there. If somehow a new global power emerged, let's say, and they created their own currency, you'd see the same fluctuations you see with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is literally fluctuating until it finds its sweet spot.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:16:49
I don't think that's the only issue.
What benefit would the government get from this? Why would they adopt this?

Technically, he's wrong. The answer should have been Cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:50:37
Yes. Use Coibase (Google it) if you want simplicity but potentially problems. If you want safety then I suggest you use Mt. Gox (Google it, takes a few days to verify you). 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:44:53
Thanks for answering my question. The distributed database, though. Could you expand on that? Is that what miners are or is "the blockchain" merely the website?
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:25:27
Aww. Come on, Los Angeles small business owners! Get some god damned BTC implementation, already!
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:49:14
Even though we're deviating further into the tangent I created, I'm going to say that I enjoy foreplay so much that it lasts hours for me. It's how I do stuff with my girlfriend for hours on end, and she's not even that hot. With Jessica Alba, though? Shiiiiit.

Man, this guy is taking advantage of his dad lol.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:08:34
Well, it's a multi-layered question so let me ask this first:
What's stopping me or a group of people from voting using our multiple wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:06:06
Do not click this.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:43:02
You're thinking small. 1,000 will be low in like two weeks to a month.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:06:25
Quarks. I'm saying it now. Quark coin. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:59:18
Acting like Bitcoin isn't a vehicle for day-trading is like denying the Holocaust exists. People use BTC to make a profit. It's shocking, I know.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:07:50
Don't worry. Someone sent me BTC over Block chain and it was like that for like 5 days before it was confirmed and on my account for sure. No worries, dude.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:50:45
Thank you for your very informative answer. It is must appreciated.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:55:05
It's a form of currency. Yes, it works in Europe. Basically, it's a new form of payment. Why should we use this new form of payment? Well, it's simple!
1) Everything you pay using BTC is completely anonymous. A lot of people value this anonymity. 
2) You know how businesses take credit cards and debit cards as payment? Well, that isn't free you know. Companies like Visa charge those little guys for accepting CC's as form of payments per purchase. With Bitcoin, you can pay and the business owner doesn't have to pay anybody anything.
3) You can make cash if you buy it now and simply hold onto it for a few months/years. 
4) Sending money to friends and family is very fast and works similarly to Paypal wallet which is extremely convenient if you have places that accept it.

I think they would rather have more expensive elections than to be more transparent. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:04:51
Quite frankly, I predicted $650 and I didn't take into account that it would rise in popularity so quickly.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:39:49
We are experiencing it right now, and at worst BTC will hit 1,100.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:58:33
Dont listen to this guy, its a scam
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:47:30
Why people even consider selling EVER is beyond me. Look at all time graphs. It only goes up and up, why would you sell now? Yeah, it might crash to like 600-700 in a few days , maybe even a few hours, but as the patterns show it'll only bounce back and  be worth twice as much.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:39:43
Yes, but thought experiments are kinda useless if the thought is not feasible. What if I had a unicorn and was the richest man in the world and had Jessica Alba fucking me the entire day? One could only dream of such a situation.
Thoughts experiments are nothing more than masturbatory navel-gazing. 
Believe me, though, I think it's great. This whole transparency thing and being a cheaper means of elections along with stopping vote rigging? It's all great, dude. I wish it would exist, the same way I wish my aforementioned fantasy would, too.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:46:15
If the majority of the world adopted it, and considering how the number of Bitcoins in existence are limited, we're talking about hundreds of thousands to millions.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:40:19
I think you underestimate the government's rigidity.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:10:33
It's never too late. People thought it was too late two months ago and one month ago. The best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second best time is now.

So much for BTC being an easy to use nonrestrictive method of paying...if we want to tip people, we'll do what we want.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:41:36
Too lazy to Google and writing a paper at the moment. How much is 1 oz of gold?
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:12:38
So you're basically saying the government will give some sort of piece of a bitcoin to people to vote with? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:07:55
I would say they are if they keep happening. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:57:59
Just doing some trollin'
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:02:35
Well, their definition is stupid. How can they define Bitcoin without using the word "Crpytocurrency"? I saw their definition and it could have been cut in half with that word.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:03:26
People can have multiple wallets and can simply use other people's addresses to vote using their wallets. How do you account for this?
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:11:56
I bet this is the same guy (spammer) just pretending like he's doing it so nobody else does.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:42:03
Read the sidebar for fuck's sake.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:52:03
1. True. I understand BTC and I've never panicked ever at the crashes. I just watch and wait only to be rewarded further.
2. The safest way to make profits would be to simply hold onto the BTC. That's guaranteed profit, practically.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:58:13
The simple answer is that we all just don't know. What we do know is that the sweet spot could potentially reach the millions. Asking that question is like asking what storyline CM Punk will be in three years from now. Hell, we don't know if he'll retire in the next two years or not. 
What we do know is that the sweet spot is more than likely going to be higher than what the price is now. Even though BTC is not very popular and still a baby, look at how much it's worth. Once it's adopted in many more places, you can only imagine it'd drastically rise.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:54:57
Patterns and the overall trend of Bitcoin's all time value. Based on what I see, we should see 1200 (at the minimum) by December 15 if it continues to increase as fast as it is now. It shows no signs of stopping and is growing faster by the day. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:20:18
Sorry, but it looks like shit.
