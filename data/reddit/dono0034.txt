Altucher is a master copywriter and marketer. He carefully crafted this newsletter to induce FOMO without actually making a prediction, other than that Amazon will someday accept Bitcoin. Let's face it, by 2034, most of us would believe that Amazon might accept crypto.
The hook of his offer is that you need to buy his report by Oct. 26th because there might be news by then. After buying, the validation is that someday Amazon will accept BTC and that "could" be announced by their next earnings report. Sure, and I "could" win the Powerball tonight.
He then discusses the existing partnership between AWS  &lt;not Amazon.com&gt; and DCG. He states an Amazon leader confirmed that connection, not that Amazon will accept Bitcoin. This is all 2016 news.
This is where Squawker (whoever they are) actually comes out looking pretty scammy instead, taking this marketing newsletter and sensationalizing things he didn't exactly say.
I like James writing and podcast, even if I don't love his promo style at times. I paid the $29 for his report basically to see which alts he is excited about. 
I don't think he's a con artist, but his marketing hook on this one opened him up for a fake news outlet to warp his takes and cause a lot of misinformation to spread.

I re-read the newsletter. He says Mullins confirmed AWS has been collaborating with DCG, nothing more.  The AWS/DCG work group is old news, reported back in 2016: 
It doesn't say Mullins confirmed that Amazon will accept Bitcoin.

It's mostly entertainment rather than research as far as I'm concerned. I do like how he explains crypto and its importance in the history of money and belief. I will likely borrow some of that when explaining crypto to friends / family.  
He has only released the first of six installments so far.  Unless I missed something, he hasn't recommended any altcoins yet. The course is presented as video of James teaching a few ultra-noobs about crypto in a small group setting.
