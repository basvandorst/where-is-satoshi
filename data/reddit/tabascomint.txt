Thanks everyone.  This is super helpful. When I have a bit more time in the next few day, I'm going to edit the article to incorporate your suggestions. Especially big thanks to   and  for their feedback.

Wouldn't the hacker also need your Authy back up password to decrypt your tokens? It's not as simple as just forwarding your phone number. Is it?
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:30:48
Yes.  Exactly the people who are currently off the internet are mostly currently unbankable.  Bringing them online is step 1.

Lots of truth in your comment here.  And yes, almost everything on my list are conditional statements.

This list of reasons it could go down are great.  I've been meaning to also make a long list of reasons Bitcoin could go down 80% and will add these to the list.  I hope it doesn't get immediately downvoted when I post the bearish list. :)

Yes, this is a really good point as well.  Professional investor friends tell me that stocks keep going up because of TINA - "There is No Alternative".  Even if Blackrock is 50% off and there is only $25 T in cash looking for a home, at some point that wakes up to BTC. 
I also agree that there is still a healthy chance that BTC can go down 99%.  I'd like to put a list together of reasons that might happen.  What would you add to that list?
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:45:50
As you can tell from my list, I'm bullish on Bitcoin.  That said, it has very significant odds it goes down 99% from here! Don't invest a penny more than you are willing to lose.

Good point.  I missed the ability to opt out of central bank shenanigans and its related inflation. Thanks for adding it!

Thanks.  This is helpful. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:10:04
Yeah.  Turns out I came up with one more idea after I wrote the title :)
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:31:51
Yes! That's a huge point I should have put in there.  Bitcoin is so  anti-fragile that even time can't entirely kill it.

Great to hear that some other employer has done the same thing.  How did it go?  Were your employees happy for it?  Or would they have preferred getting some other form of compensation?

Cool!  I wasn't aware of this service. I don't think I'll use it for my employees, but what a cool way to tip around town while spreading bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:52:31
Good point. We are a tech company, so almost everyone will have heard of bitcoin, but I don't think anyone will have their own wallets or know how to use bitcoin yet.  Would love to get other opinions about whether people think I should or shouldn't do this idea at all. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:42:42
Excuse the ignorant question: How does a bitcoin ATM work. Does it require ID or KYC to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-11-20 06:02:24
Wow!  Yes!
@_date: 2016-09-12 07:12:27
wikiHow to the rescue.

One additional thing to consider. Even if a minority UASF chain does not get successfully attacked, it will suffer branding issues. The chain which retains the name Bitcoin and the symbol BTC will have billions of dollars in brand value. We need the USAF chain to have the majority hashing power so there is no doubt which chain is "the real bitcoin"

Once segwit is running is there anything I'll need to do to maintain or upgrade my paper wallet using BIP38 passphrase? Or can I just ignore it as I hodl fort the next decade or two? 
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:37:51
Just read this bill. Among other questionable ideas, It is trying to regulate transfers of crypto from one party to another. Can you imagine:. Each entity that sends bitcoin to anyone will need to get a license before actually using their private keys. This should be stopped!

Interesting! We're they able to steal anything other than wallets created using the brain wallet techniques?
