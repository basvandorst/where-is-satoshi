Bitonic.nl or google "anycoin" can help you if you're in the netherlands, belgium or france and have a debit card

Can confirm that Bitonic is legit, but personally i use Anycoin. Also dutch company, same payment options but their fees are slightly lower than Bitonic.

you're right! 
They must have changed their pricing because i used to compare and anycoindirect always had the lowest.
Guess i'll use Bitonic again then.
It seems to fluctuate a lot because as i am typing this 13h44 GMT, 2 bitcoins cost 1515 € on Bitonic.nl and 1502 € on Anycoindirect.eu
