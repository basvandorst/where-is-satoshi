Dollar cost average after DYOR
@_date: 2019-03-14 04:53:08
Why is this not surprising 
@_date: 2019-11-14 22:11:19
Abra. Credit card. You could buy a prepaid credit card I suppose
@_date: 2019-11-08 22:07:23
Coinbase Pro Limit orders are 0% fee on desktop. Abra app on iOS also has 0% fees on ACH bank transfers
@_date: 2019-11-10 21:05:11
They changed it? That sucks

BTC to 1k
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:51:28
Now don’t sell
@_date: 2019-10-04 00:16:36
Limit orders are still free aren’t they?
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:11:55
Wanted to buy drugs on the internet in 2013
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:13:36
I suggest doing the opposite at this point in time (obviously you’ll need a job but stay away from stocks until the next crash just around the corner) 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:10:57
I never said bitcoin wasn’t king bro, chill. Enjoy your Sunday 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:31:43
Alright thank you for exposing your stupidity 
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:18:11
Exactly 
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:50:33
Not good. Can’t generalize altcoins by looking at one project tho. Top picks: DigiByte, Tezos, Cardano, Bitcoin, Litecoin
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:12:32
So then buy some or mine some like the rest of us lol
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:45:16
GDAX has no withdrawal fees, just 0.25% transaction fees. Use Shapeshift to turn it into something else and put it into a paper wallet. If your desired coin isn’t on shapeshift, deal with fees for now I guess 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:27:06
Paper wallet. I store the key on an encrypted, password protected USB drive 
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:03:37
I wish I bought when it was $0.001. All you can do is move forward and research more; no point in pitying your past 
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:43:33
Coinbase fees=1.5% buying and selling 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:06:03
Sell at acceptable highs. Rebuy a month later to avoid non-deductible wash sale losses if you incur any of course. Rebuy lower. Or just HODL
@_date: 2018-03-30 07:04:32
We’re good. It’s a market correction. Gains that go up like that are bound to come down before going up again. We’re not losing crypto anytime soon. Whales manipulate the market and get billions of free dollars doing it. We’re good 
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:11:44
Yeah how did you know I hold 100% DigiByte��
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:58:25
In that case I could keep some cash reserve to invest at even lower lows 
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:27:14
 No one knows. When tax season ends it may go up 
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:07:49
Good post 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:32:44
You don’t. You forget about it and hold then sell at ATH
@_date: 2018-03-28 01:48:02
Better investment opportunities in the crypto world than bitcoin. Bitcoin will do well, but percentage increase, other will do much better 
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:32:18
I hope you’re joking. It could happen I guess. I don’t think we’ll go below 5k min
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:29:27
If you’re trying to get a lambo from buying 1 Bitcoin now it might be too late, there are more undervalued cryptocurrencies out there that are faster, more decentralized, more secure and can handle way more transactions per second (DigiByte) 
@_date: 2019-09-28 04:09:27
Buy BTC on Coinbase Pro with limit orders for 0% fee. Transfer to external key generated and stored offline securely via any verifiable paper wallet generator. You’re welcome
@_date: 2019-09-28 04:14:59
Rule 1 of investing: Don’t lose money;  
Rule 1 of crypto: HODL
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:43:27
As far as mining goes they could shut down the network if what you say is true given 51%
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:24:46
Crypto mining is energy expensive, but this is good. It’ll force us to either abandon crypto all together (which won’t happen given institutional investors coming in), or generate new ideas for clean, cheap and powerful energy, something the world fucking needs 
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:29:42
I see bitcoin at $1M before 2030 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:48:57
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:22:37
That’s what I’m doing on a dollar cost averaging strategy weekly. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:34:52
Well they’ve already taken it over
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:22:19
Wait for it to hit $1M. Global money supply is $90 T so $1M bitcoin is easily possible long term 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:49:44
Makes sense good point 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:26:20
Join the party 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:36:50
Cars, housing, anything that uses electricity...
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:10:32
Everyone is taking about it wtf 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:50:34
Yeah and to institutional investors it’s free money 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:41:16
You’ve got a point. I’d DigiByte the next Apple? Maybe. I’ll hold what I have but won’t buy more 
@_date: 2018-04-12 00:11:44
One answer: DigiByte ��
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:51:53
Thanks man. I’m definitely looking into acquiring a lot of ETH as well 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:33:09
I don’t want a bull run yet. I’m not ready !
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:26:47
Yeah mine might be $15k. $10k withdrawals? You can increase withdrawal limit by requesting with a ball statement though 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:32:33
Many other coins offer a decentralized fixed supply. Many. With cheaper fees and faster transactions 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:34:46
Great informative post��
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:48:41
You’re absolutely right. Any guesses at which those may be? Ik your answers will likely be biased. That’s okay as long as you explain 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:32:07
Correction followed by inevitable lift off. You think whales will stop manipulating the market? No. They like free money. They’ll continue to do so until crypto is outlawed. I’m fine with it. Just buy low sell high 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:05:43
The richest already own a majority of global wealth. Nothing new 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:14:09
You’re correct. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:50:34
 Completely agree. Awesome post man 
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:44:37
5,000,000 USD. I’ll sell and reinvest along the way
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:09:14
I’m hoping it turns government on its back and fucks it
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:39:36
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:11:04
Banks will buy out crypto increasing wealth gap and decreasing fiat value likely, playing the good guy 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:13:32
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:59:18
Spend it eventually. If you’re gonna die soon that’s a dif story. At my age of 20 I’d wait for it to be adopted mainstream in 10 years then spend it
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:48:54
Keep it on a ledger nano or backup your keys to an encrypted flash drive. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:01:29
I’m down for that 
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:51:25
Malware is a risk. 
Faulty wallet generators are a risk. 
Paper lying around is a risk. 
Decentralization is the big one. If you take proper precautions it’s incredibly safe. 
It solves the debt problem of inflationary fiat. 
It’s okay if you don’t believe in it. 
I can’t predict where it will go, only speculate. I’m willing to take a risk on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:43:09
Moving away from centralized fractional reserve banking systems that inflate currency 
Artificially leading to unnecessary economic crashes, is a big one. Many functions. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:45:21
Why do some wallets then hold billions of dollars in assets? Who’s stealing their money? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 22:50:38
You can spend up to $10k a week and increase your limits. What do you mean? Use GDAX bank transfers 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:42:17
For some cryptocurrency with no use case yes you’re right. Many 80% of ICO were scams 
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:11:31
Yeah don’t do a $350k deal with a rando. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:22:01
Very true. I’m too tired of reading up on news every day 
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:37:08
Should’ve held ��
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:02:19
With market manipulation, institutional investors can control the market, selling high and buying back low. Many are getting into it. Rockefeller Venrock, Yahoo!, etc etc etc. there are many getting into it. We’re past the early adopter ICO craze, then we’re going to steadily exponentially advance or boom again in a new market cycle  
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:53:21
Good perspective ��
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:02:30
Bitcoin at $21T? The whole market might be. But fiat and gold collectively are only ~$15T total..so. I’m bullish too but competition exists with better tech 
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:40:23
Money supply now is $90 T. Global asset wealth is $280T. Derivatives market is $1.2 quadrillion. 
Even if money supply stays around $100 T, Bitcoin could take all of it theoretically. Crypto as a whole could take all of it over time. 
Let’s say crypto takes $10T. 
It’s less than $400B right now. 
Bitcoin is less than $200B. 
Bitcoin is a safe buy. I’m buying undervalued projects mostly, have owned bitcoin in the past. 
Crypto is Not a bubble. It’s a replacement for fractional reserve banking that even the banks are buying into. 
It’s a replacement fueled by technology elucidating what money is without a system to uphold it: worthless; it’s a replacement fueled by hype, by greed; it’s a replacement fueled by the necessities of security taking into account the advent of quantum computing and AI.
Bitcoin is here to stay. If it isn’t, cryptocurrency as a whole is. 
Btw you have a 1/quindecillion or 10^48 chance of hacking into a private key. Makes your password and username to your bank look like a four piece jigsaw puzzle of a giraffe made of cardboard. 
All in on crypto.

Lol no, drugs 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:22:21
Agree. XLM? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:45:50
True. I just don’t like coinbase fees of 1.5%. It adds up
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:43:17

Will do. Thinking XLM, ETH, BTC 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:21:07
Honest to god. It’s cheaper and more secure to use for everyone. Global money supply is $90 trillion 
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:56:42
Neither is inflationary fiat causing debt bubbles 
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:37:57
What do you mean you were buying too many things with bitcoin? Were you just transferring it out?
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:19:14
Good way of putting it actually. I mean I believe it’ll go much bigger 
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:53:46
Why have the Rockefellers and Rothschild family firms began investing in it? Not conspiracy. They literally announced that they see its potential. They just are going to transfer their wealth from the old system to the new. I’m fine with that as an investor. ✌️
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:43:35
How would they get your private key if you generated it offline disconnected from the internet? 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:52:36
Yeah I hadn’t bought any yet but I may. It seems undervalued for its niche use case 
@_date: 2018-04-15 00:20:11
$90 T money supply globally. Think about that. We really going to be minting coins and fiat in 20-30 years at all? Look back at 1980. Look at what tech has accomplished since then 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:52:43
It’s low. I hate buying with a credit card, waiting a while for it to transact (3-5 days) and seeing the price even lower 
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:09:26
Then I only get 3 eggs 
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:30:45
“In view of associated risks”. Fuck the banks. More like “in view of the fact that we enjoy slaving over you with our bullshit centralized inflationary fiat”. This pisses me off. India’s financial system is one of the most corrupt. Doesn’t surprise me. Fuck the banks 
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:44:47
Not yet! I’m not ready �� don’t moon yet!

I mean if someone tried to take down Nike right now. I know all great things are startups at one point 
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:26:02
Use GDAX bank deposits. 0.25% fees buying  and selling. Downside is that it takes a week. That’s what I do. Keep a constant source of cash flowing into GDAX on a weekly basis and buy and hold and transfer out to Shapeshift then paper wallets 
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:21:50
True. I’d rather save all of it
