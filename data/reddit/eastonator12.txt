Yeah it’ll probably be there by morning 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:22:07
Yes of course, when fees aren’t 20 dollars to send 5 dollars worth of BTC and it becomes a mainstream currency instead of being viewed by the public as a money making machine or black market money
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:06:27
Oh SHI-BOOOOM
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:54:54
I’ve been hacked by hackerman. Nice job
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:56
yeah thats what is was. thanks for reminding me
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:07
Thought so
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:33:40
wow. they need to do that
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:08
ahh. that makes sense, but why did it rise in price so much so fast?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:47
More, it’s a joke
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:32:41
Wow and here I thought I got hacked lmao
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:47
The photoshop is poor with this one
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:54:45
Makes sense. Woke up to a surprise 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:44:21
Around 10000 years, but by then you won’t be able to mine btc, and you wouldn’t be around to spend them
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:59:41
It’s never too late. HODL for life
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:58
Hold on to it. Bitcoin is not a free money machine, it is volatile. That means it goes up and down at any given point. Bcash, a fork of bitcoin, fucked bitcoin in the ass today. But prices will go back up, I’d say it’ll be back at 19k within a few days
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:53
That’s my motto, always invest what you can’t afford to lose.
Also, you’re a idiot. Bitcoins price is volatile, it goes up and down at any given time. If you got a loan from a bank and sunk all of it into Btc, you very well may be fucked. You should have just saved up paycheck to paycheck, then bought some, not get a loan for something that can drop like flies. I really hope this post is a joke. If it’s not, well, at least there are people dumber than me
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:47
Username checks out
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:11:55
Same. Bought the dip and already made profit
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:43
Yep, hodlin on tight. Probably gonna buy this dip
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:46:09
Not so fast: I’ve traced back your transaction and hacked you and your entire apartments internet, now I’ve installed malware which mines bitcoins and sends it to my address!
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:53:02
SegWit I imagine?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:59:40
Yeah nvm, we will get there eventually. Do you think Bitcoin price increasing is exponential, as in the higher the price gets the faster the price will rise? If that’s the case, we will see at latest 1mil before or around 2024
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:47:08
I bought 100 coins at 8 dollars, now I’ve made over a million bucks. But I haven’t sold them yet, I’m HODLING until I make 2 mil.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:08
How would someone even do this though? Did nicehash just have a huge wallet and someone got the private keys? What can you do with private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:16:10
Wrong post sorry I meant to respond to someone else idk why it posted it on this post
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:34:45
It’s funny because they thought it would work. Yeah, it dropped to 14k, but now it’s stable at 17500 again
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:44
Will be using this. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:43:01
Then why even fucking comment
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:32:12
Yep, tomorrow

(Only anime reference I know sorry)
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:40:36
There’s a promotion on the website, but I was just wondering for anyone who’s bought over 100 on Coinbase, if they got a extra 10
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:01:14
Yeah I made a mistake and kept my btc in there  due to the high ass fees to transfer, lost my 3500 worth of BTC. It’s fine that they’re doing loans but it does upset me
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:57:28
Is Hill in my Reddit account? I’m still trying to figure out how you did that, or is there something I’m not seeing...if you did hack something, good job. I’m proud
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:36:05
Oh yeah? While she thought I wasn’t paying attention I put a bomb in her purse and disabled her phone. Can’t wait till she gets home!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:23
this helped me understand it. thanks for the explanation.
btc is going back up now. good
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:47:27
You thought that was my plan? I knew you were going to do that so I hacked the atm and put fraudulent bills inside, now you’re the proud owner of counterfeit cash! All I have to do is call the cops on you and you’re screwed, but i won’t do that. Once your in the bahamas, I’ll hack Russia and drop a ballistic missile on both of your asses 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:00:49
Ohhh. I assume when it does it’ll drop back to 3.3k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:09
what the hell is this
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:43:29
Ok now I feel like a moron
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:16:07
How is bitcoin a Ponzi scheme tho
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:47:01
Yeah I don’t understand it. Moved my main selling place to Gemini after coinbase pulled that shit. Shitcoincash isn’t worth a fraction of a penny. It’s just a pump and dump scheme and people fell for it
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:17:05
Coinbase practically locked everyone out. My account is verified and everything and I still can’t buy or sell
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:45:35
How’d you get that much bitcoin cash anyway? Can you mine it?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:00:35
A “small loan of 10mil” may have worked for 10k, what would work for 11k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:37:34
ok, i've been looking at cold storage, couldn't decide between trezor, or the other popular one...cant place the name
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:22:30
Tbh I have a Ledger Nano and it’s great and fast
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:55:58
No I’m on mobile I didnt see anything
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:50:14
Idk probably the butter since it exists in the physical world and bitcoin is internet money 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:43:12
Ok, thanks. I thought if I bought 5k worth I’d get a extra 500$ worth of btc, but that was a lie apparently 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:37:43
No condoms for this ride
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:09:20
Bro we all know you’re doing this to get money from referrals, fuck outta here
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:01:07
Hold on, I scanned your id and credit card from your wallet using the security camera in the building you burnt down, now I’ve stolen your girlfriend! MUAHAHAHA
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:31:54
we'll probably be at 20k by tomorrow morning
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:59:32
I usually just leave it in my Twitter description and Facebook profile 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:04:10
Too late, I’ve hacked your Monero wallet. Also, your girl sucked my dick when she was at my place, sorry man. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:24:54
How to get rich: set up a mining pool, make a cool looking website and a easy to use miner, of course have a online wallet. Then, transfer that BTC that thousands of people have mined and stored in your online wallet, to multiple other addresses and say you got “hacked”. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:33:40
This shouldn’t exist
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:25:41
Why tho
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:27:02
Too bad I also hacked all your altcoin wallets and installed a tracking app in your phone, computer, and car, and will be issuing a targeted missile strike on your position at the time of this comment being posted. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:11:13
I don’t wanna go to jail
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:07:11
Will do. Just gotta wait
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:07:27
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:11:51
Oh, forgot about that. It’d be nice if I had my BTC in coinbase when the fork happened, I woulda been rich. F u c k m e
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:06:43
Well, I didn’t know that...guess I won’t make a post when it hits 12k
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:28
Yeah today with BCH drove me over the edge. They’re doing shady shit
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:53
Isn’t Gdax coinbase tho?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:18:42
oH n0 don’t hack me
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:38
All these posts saying “omg I lost money” and “omg why did it go down” I’m like
My motto is always invest more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:09
That’s my motto: Always invest what you can’t afford to lose 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:13:33
Yeah I’d recommend Gemini. I’ve had no problems trying to buy or sell. Coinbase is a nightmare when It spikes 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:44:20
I mined at least 3000 coins starting in 2012, my gaming rig mined at least 3 coins a day. At the time, it was cool and all but I wanted real money so I sold some and transferred around 200 coins to a wallet. Fortunalt when bitcoin hit 8k I found the old rig I had and transferred those coins to another wallet, then sold some. Now I have enough to buy a new car :D
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:06:26
Ah, so you bought some at 3k then it went to 9k and you were able to sell it? Lucky bastard
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:47:20
Are you saying 1btc will be 15-20k by the end of this year, or did I read this wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:36:33
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:49:08
You should at least add a btc address so people can donate for your sacrifice 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:06:52
Wow thanks, I’m gonna buy some. Thanks for your input mate
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:17
I’ve been watching for a few days, loved watching it soar to 9000 then 10k
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:46:43
Would u recommend the Exodus desktop wallet? I’m using that right now, if not that what’s a good one 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:01:40
Repost from r/blackpeopletwitter
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:57:13
Based on what tho
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:33:43
So if it IS a scam, what about all the computers in thier buildings? Did they fake the videos?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:05:24
Well I was already gonna buy some eventually but this gave me a extra bonus 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:57:49
So if Genesis is a lie, what about buying a Antminer S9? Would that be worth it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:18
Yeah I’d appreciate if my 5000 I sunk in doesn’t get wasted, I shoulda sold at 11k...unFORTUNATLY coinbase hasn’t cleared the bank transfer yet
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:40:55
Well yeh obviously but I spent more than it’s currently valued at
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:00:57
do you really believe this shit? if you do I feel bad for you and your parents who will most likely have to carry you for the rest of their miserable lives
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:42:34
Nice thanks
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:52:31
here's what you do. take the btc from coinbase and put it into a desktop wallet if you haven't already. you can then say you already spent the bitcoin, and they can't figure out where it went. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:38:46
Well I mean I can afford one for 9000, which will give me a 11k increase if it goes to 20k during xmas 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:49:54
I’ll let you know when I invent time travel. I do watch rick and morty so I’ll be done in no time 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:28
Yeah I worded that wrong. Just was wondering if it was only bc of everyone selling at 11k, or something else
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:53:30
Yeah I could be making a big amount of money, so it’ll all be worth it. If I had a time machine I’d go back to when BTC was 3 a piece and buy 1000 of em 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:48:27
not if you don't tell them you have any
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:18:19
I’m aware
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:30:27
Well first of all you should never invest is something you don’t fully understand. Anyway, just keep it in a secure wallet, and keep the private keys safe, or someone can steal your bitcoin. Once that’s done forget about it for a while, probably 10 years. Checking every day or every week will drive you insane. It will go up, it will go down. But at the end of it all, you will most likely have made a profit. A big one.
