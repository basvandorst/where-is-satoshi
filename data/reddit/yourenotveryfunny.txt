Same thing applies regardless of age. You will pay 10 or 20% Capital gains Tax on your profit above £11,100 once you sell your BTC. This allowance is unrelated to your personal allowance described below.
The reason you don't pay tax on your regular job is because you make less than £11,500 per year. If you make less than £8160, you also don't pay national insurance which means all your earnings are be tax free.

So close... Such a huge wall for EUR.

It does so by sending the funds to a multisignature wallet (where more than one person can claim the balance) where you are one of the party and the other person at the other end of the channel is the other party. The closure of the lightning channel (settlement) will force both parties to sign the allow the balance to be properly distributed.
This article explains several building blocks of LN which are quite easy to understand.

No. Not normal. 
I also have a pending SEPA transfer to them which normally should have cleared by 10am today and still hasn't gone through.

Nothing. Do you have a need for KRW? I'm sure if there must be people who do have such need but for the majority of people who purchased coin with USD or EUR or whatever has no need for KRW.

They seem to like the number 16 for some reason. I wonder if their random number generator was broken.

Its probably easy for you to purchase BTC with USD if you already have USD and live in a place where its easy to get USD but in Korea its not as easy to get USD.
Its also currently 11950 Euro on gdax which translates to about 14094 USD.

SEPA transfers, at least from revolut are done in batches. When you submit it you receive a confirmation email saying it was 'Submitted'. 
This is usually quick. This just means that it has been queued up to go on the next available batch. When the batch gets processed, you receive another email saying that your payment was 'Executed'.
It will only get executed during weekdays long before the banks close on Friday. So something that was sent Saturday wont go until the first few batches Monday morning.
Once the transaction is executed, it will not show as pending on Coinbase/GDAX until they process it.
In my experience, once its executed, it gets processed by Coinbase in about 3 hours, then I receive an email from Coinbase saying that they received the transfers. I suppose this time may be longer if they are having lots of activity.
If your payment still hasn't been executed (It should have been executed on Monday if you sent it on Saturday), it hasn't left Rrevolut yet. I personally sent a SEPA transfer on Friday afternoon, it was submitted the same day but wasn't executed until Monday morning at 8am, it arrived at the exchange around 10:30am.

Any seed generator (like  uses enough randomness to generate a secure seed. You don't have to generate it online. In the example, you can download it and run the program offline.
Yes and Yes to the other questions.
If the seed is generated using a bitcoin standard like BIP39 then it will work on any app (web or otherwise) that supports it.

1. Because something has become inaccessible, it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist. These coins are not 'taken away from the pool'. They still exist exactly where they were, but are now inaccessible without the private key.
2. Bitcoins are not 'stored' in physical hardware. The physical hardware just stores the private key which gives you access to spend the coins (as well as some hardware keeping a up-to-date-ish balance of your coins).
3. This is correct. All the bitcoins exist at once but they exist as part of a balance of a particular private key (see 2). When a user spends bitcoins, the balance of their private key is reduced and the balance of the receiver private key is increased, the transactions is confirmed on the blockchain.

Now that I have sent my coins from the exchange to my segwit address, will any new transactions i sent to any other segwit addresses be quicker? If so, how do I calculate the fees for segwit transfers based on my confirmation requirements?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:11:43


The difference here is that visa has no guarantee that you will pay at the end of the month. LN guarantees that both parties "account" will be properly balanced when the channel closes.

If BTC didn't have these problems, how would you feel?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:57:31
I personally only use GDAX but does Coinbase sell directly into your back account? I was under the impression that you first sell your BTC and that stays in fiat in your coinbase account and then you withdraw the amount into your bank.

Nothing particularly special about. Its simple and supports BIP39 with segwit support. No bells and whistles just a simple wallet.

This is indeed strange. Even with superfast 1 block confirmation of over 800sat/b it should only cost around 0.00310000 BTC.
I withdrew from gdax yesterday and they paid 750sat/b and it was nearly instant.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:55:16
Not just the cost but an 'easy' solution like this just encourages laziness and at some point, and scale will outgrow any proposed block size.

Quite balanced and informative.
Brazil's banking system is almost alien to the rest of the world. It's a pain in the ass to send money to or from Brazil.
If there is a country that is ripe for decentralization of currencies with a population that embraces technology is Brazil.
Best part of the segment was the example given where you buy a coffee (cafezinho) for **0.05 BTC** the transactions gets confirmed by the network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:19:24
I assume you were informed of the fees during coinbase the withdrawal process, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:37:42
~~Why would it cost $907 to do a transaction with a single input and possibly 2 output?~~
I suppose it makes sense if it was a donation wallet with close to 800 donations.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:44:48
When the network was empty around the beginning of december, I sent a instant (next block confirmation) transaction with fees 0.00002360 which is 32 cents USD in **current price**. That or lower is the price you can expect to pay for txs with full segwit implementation.

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:58:16
You don't. BIP39 is just to generate a seed. Once a seed is generated, you can use that seed to generate bitcoin addresses. 
You can generate standard addresses using BIP44 path or you can generate new segwit addresses using BIP49. Each private key gives you a public address. You just send bitcoins to that address.

Coinbase SEPA has been having problems this week. I sent 3 transfers this past week and they all went thorugh. 2 weeks is just too long.
Check with your bank to see if the SEPA transfer was already executed and when.

When transferring from GDAX, coinbase pays the fees. You get exactly he amount you transferred.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:29:20
Well good news for you is that the solution for this problem is already developed and implemented. Its called segwit. Of course we're seeing it slowly being adopted and with he amount of txs exchanges have been making recently from legacy addresses has clogged up the network but as others have mentioned, at 100% segwit utilization, there would be practically no fees and txs would be confirmed almost immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:06:26
Withdrew a couple of days ago from GDAX and the tx fee was 740, they paid the whole thing. Wouldn't surprise me if they are at 1000 now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:59:48
Hopefully you sent it to a segwit address paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:12:24

Both super easy. Revolut is an app you install. There will be some identity verification since banks must require this but you can get the process done in a few hours. You will then get a new sort code and bank account number for the GBP account, then you add a EUR account for which you will receive an IBAN.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:18:30
Unlike physical wallets, bitcoin currency isn't stored in a wallet. The wallet is just the private key which gives you access to the funds. A bitcoin wallet is just a public key and a private key (or a seed word sequence). Some software store these in an actual wallet file which is often protected by a passphrase.
If you don't have the software used to create a wallet file, the wallet file itself, the private key, seed words or don't know your private key by heart then there is little to no chance to recover it.

It would seem that the best method of transferring bitcoin back to sterling would be to send it to an exchange, sell it as Euro, transfer to either a Fidor or Revolut account and then convert to GBP and to your bank account.
Most national banks in the UK still have an aversion to payments coming in from exchanges's banks.
