Really not comparable. 
If gmail shutdown email wouldn't be dead but there would sure be a lot fewer common folks to email. 
Hell it's hard enough to email (non work related) people and get a timely response [where I get a response in under 5 minutes if I message over facebook]. Take away the super easy to use gmail and yeah lot of people are going to disappear for a while and email WILL be set back fairly significantly. I know quite a few people who have gmail setup to pull from other mail accounts too, if google goes down they can't read email.  
So yeah this doesn't kill bitcoin but it's going to hurt adoption - especially after a huge bubble burst still fresh in many.

I think they can stop allowing you to exchange it for US currency.
Not sure if this is a law but isn't there something about not being aloud to accept foreign currency?(maybe that's just due to the hassle involved with exchange rates- there may be something about not allowing the foreign currency to be cheaper or giving change in foreign currency) - I would assume there would be a law forbidding you to not accept the local currency.
I think there are some laws concerning battering when dealing with high cost goods. I know I can't buy a $100k car from you for a dollar and expect to only pay the tax of a price of gum. 
You might have to dig into some of the stuff concerning virtual currency (like secondlife dollars, WoW gold, etc) I remember reading stuff about some of the legal issues with trading that for real money - I think with the secondlife dollars it was mostly 'tax the fuck out of you'
Either way I think the ban will be more "we are going to make your life hell if you try and do business like this"

 You also don't pretend like you're password is secure after someone sends it to you in plain text. 
It's like yeahh i'll XXXX my password and the guy will delete my password and life will be secure!

It's depressing because sending emails takes weeks (if ever) to get a reply. Facebook messenger takes 5 minutes.

Like just hire a good accountant and or lawyer? 
I dunno, this just seems like a lot of effort to dodge the tax man. 
And 54 million isn't really that much money (well it is to me, but in the grand scheme of things... some pro sports players make more than that in a year)

My Satoshi is some 10 year old genius/prodigy kid. 
That stash of coins is tucked away until the kid turns 18 and can claim his fortune :)

Fame, duh. BTC is popular and my tinder profile isn't panning out. (see below)


It's embarrassing and involves a crazy girlfriend. 


See above.

no way. What has been setup is a situation where folks who meet him will of course ask "are you really him?" and he will respond with something clever followed by a wink or a grin. 
I'm sure 6 months to a year from now we will hear about some big bitcoin businesses working with him. 
And I mean at the end of the day, someone who managed to do a pretty damn good conning some otherwise bright people, is the sorta guy I want working for me and not my competition (though maybe on a short leash) 
Maybe i'm wrong, maybe he is the guy and really just realized "shit people are looking into every facet of my life and this was a bad idea...." but i'm sceptical, just seems like a lot of work, with many opportunities to back out, that I can't possibly believe he just woke up and realized this. 
The real thing I took away from all of this is that it seems like there really is a lot more to the story of bitcoin and the people at the heart of it that we probably will never know.

This is how I learned to write and I'm in my 20s. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:32:57
well the next time you will have to, but this guy can now meet folks and after saying 'no.... I'm not Satoshi' give a wink and smile and leave the person thinking "hummm" 
He's going to leave this whole thing better off than when he came in. He's a international name now. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:37:03
I dunno sounds more like people want proof that fits the community it's he's trying to prove too. 
People are just rattled that so many big names are ignoring what is such a standard procedure to verify someone is who they say they are.

I would be concerned that folks with the power to crack that level of security, would have somewhat of a vested interest in damaging the bitcoin market. 
The funny thing about it is that because obtaining this only costs electricity it's part of a different budget. (reason this is important is that while large interest groups could simply use fiat to buy tons of coins and dump them at a loss, that's a real number you have to report somewhere and be accountable for) 
I'm not sure *how* one would go about doing this in a secretive way though. The only real method I can think of would be to simply give the coins away to active addresses in a random manner. Leaving folks to think that Satoshi (who is some mystical all knowing god) was doing something we can't understand that is for the greater good. 
I sorta think this is unlikely, folks like to think bitcoin is more upsetting to the powerful than it really is. 
Either way there isn't anything anyone should do. Whoever controls those coins should move them to a new address if they care.

Well at least they do one thing correct.

i'm in my 20s I do this. 
Not sure why people think this has anything to do with age. People learn how to write differently, there are like a bazillion different rules.

Wouldn't it just be easier to hire a good lawyer? 
This just seems a little much

I would assumed the hdds were offline and this was by far the easiest way to do things - grab everything off the evidence rack, toss it in your gym bag and leave.
