The reason for the Premium?
It was a coin that was funded by Mike Caldwell on the very first day he started to make Casascius coins. It is a landmark day in crypto coin history.

HI Bobby
With such a large amount of product being created, can you give us some insight into the (mass) key creation, the security of those keys during the chip creation process and what measures are taken to ensure that the private keys are safe from recording devices, cameras, staff vulnerabilities (yes, sadly that happens :() and any other source that could compromise the integrity of the private keys stored on the chips.
What happens when you are NOT around to supervise this process because you're away on business? for say a few weeks?
One other question is "lifetime of the code" - meaning the paper the code is printed on, does this have a finite life? Is a special paper used for best performance?
Thanks in advance :) 
Nice chips BTW :D

Cheers for the answer Bobby :) covered a few things in my question too.
What happens when you are NOT there though, what supervision is given AND does this include ALL the chips too?

Hospitals have so many potential uses for it... 
I've worked in a Top5 UK Trust and could immediately identify 10 areas where it would work....and that's aside from the obvious patient data elements... its a complex place a Hospital.... begging for a quality solution...
@_date: 2016-10-05 21:38:49
Therein lies part of the challenge, unifying the disparate systems used throughout the NHS. Ideally there would be a single chain for patient data and a different one for stock control, movement and use.
In terms of Patient data, that project right there.... tricky as hell for so many reasons, but then that's the challenge.... time to step up and take it up a notch.
BTW, just because its hard doesn't mean it shouldn't be done... think like that and we'd never have got to the moon. 
Sometimes it takes out of the box thinking ....

Creating a Private Dinner to avoid Public and Press scrutiny and allow participants the opportunity to speak freely, only to then publicise it, setting ones self up (and the guests) for a fall from the outset no?
Strikes me as rather counter productive
