I wonder... I'm not very knowledgeable about hacking, but in this kind of case (where a thief and rightful owner keep going through looping actions keeping the bitcoin tied up), could law enforcement/white hat hackers eventually use the fact that the thief has to keep sending transactions as an opportunity to trace where those transactions are coming from? 
Yeah, I know there are all kinds of anonymity efforts under way in crypto. I'm just mildly hopeful that there might be an attack vector here that could at least narrow down the search for a thief in this kind of situation.

Thanks. Regarding Jesus, this was (IMHO) pretty clearly a case of mob pressure being used by the Jewish leadership to deny due process and obtain their desired result despite Roman law rather than because of it.
1. While the Romans allowed local authorities to convict and punish people for minor offenses, only Roman officials could convict and carry out execution for capital crimes. That's why the Jewish leaders spent so much effort trying to come up with a charge against Jesus that the Romans would care about. Since the Romans had appointed Herod (a non-Jew) as "King of the Jews", Jesus calling himself that could be considered treasonous by Roman authorities. (Admittedly there were clearly exceptions to this policy that local mobs/authorities got away with, as in the case of Stephen being stoned to death without Roman due process. But the natives always had to be careful about how much they could get away with before the Romans got pissed.)
2. The Jewish leaders applied their pressure through mob tactics/pressure, more than high-level negotiation. We see this in the crowd being instructed to call for Barabas's release rather than Jesus (per the Passover custom the Romans had adapted.) But the Jewish leaders also made pointed warnings to the Roman governor that he was abetting insurrection if he didn't deal with the "rebel" Jesus - supported by a mob crying for Jesus's blood in a near-riotous atmosphere.
3. Pilate was frustrated and annoyed by the whole affair - to the point of publicly literally "washing his hands" of it to signify that he really wanted nothing to do with it. It was another stupid squabble by the natives in Roman eyes. He ended up going along with the execution simply to keep the peace, fearing worse things if he did not "kill one man to save many."
TL/DR: You could say Jesus died because of "powerful men" (Jewish leaders), but they could only achieve their aim with the support and agreement of the mob; and it was only allowed by the breakdown of Roman law and failure of other powerful men to uphold it.
Sorry, just rambling....

Just buy and hodl with that amount. You may be surprised what happens even with such a small amount.
When my 6 yo daughter was born she got $45 in gifts from relatives. I made a note of it in my financial tracking but couldn't think of a way to invest that small of an amount. Finally in 2015 I bought her about .2 bitcoin with it. With lending income her stash has grown to over $3300.

Does anyone know if exchanges are actively involved with LN implementation? I would think that's where we'll get our greatest, fastest impact. Just get a couple dozen of the largest exchanges to implement LN channels between each other for users transferring from one exchange to another and a big chunk of the traffic on the blockchain will go away at once.

That's not the issue. Right now people suppose that some alts are successful only because they offer very low fees compared to Bitcoin. If both alts and BTC get LN then everyone has very low fees. That doesn't save the alts since they have low fees right now. Network effect will be dominant at that point.

This looks right. I would add that OP should be extremely cautious about trusting anyone online that you don't know personally, no matter how helpful they seem. Nothing against anyone personally.
My wife and I have talked about this scenario. She's not into crypto at all. My advice is to take things slow. If you have a trusted close friend/relative who is more proficient with computers, enlist their help, but only after careful consideration. And they should, as much as possible, just patiently show you what to do, rather than doing things themselves to disposition your Bitcoin.
That means you, OP, learning how to sign into any online exchanges your husband may have had accounts on, or setting up new ones when you are ready to sell. But do take your time and take a break if it seems overwhelming. Better to take it slow than be sorry. 
If you don't have anyone you can trust you can still find an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini (if in US), sign up for an account. If you find a lot of Bitcoin (etc) don't do anything with it all at once - try doing a test transaction first while getting the hang of it. Feel free to ask questions here, just be careful not to divulge personal or account-related information.
My heart goes out to you. May you have hope and many fond memories amidst your grief.

They must be really frustrated that tether only dropped ~1%. 
In fact, I find it interesting that Tether has spent much of the past month substantially over $1. Despite months of FUD against it people have tended to value it _more_ than the USD it is supposed to be tied to. 
And here's the final irony: They are expressing concern that tethers may not be backed by dollars... which are backed by nothing at all.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:05:11
There's no evidence the auditors "went running" given that word of the break came from the Tether side.
Your comment about  doesn't strike me as a real concern. The exchanges are counting on tether being administered fairly. If they saw that tethers were being funneled in to exchanges on Tether.to-related accounts rather than the accounts of thousands of users it would be an obvious red flag. Tethers are supposed to be issued to users who take them to exchanges. So the Tether team would have to be faking thousands or at least hundreds of accounts on the exchanges to pull this off without any of the exchanges catching on.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:08:24
You'd be surprised.
You don't seem very familiar with Roman law, at least not the bits I've read about. Roman citizens had a strong set of civil rights (as we would call them today). Even slaves had what we would call human rights - they were recognized as fully human and could not be deprived of life without due process (in contrast to the late American plantation system that ruled slaves as mere property to be disposed of at will). At least that was the theory - I'm sure once you were on a slave galley the niceties of the law got blurred.
In any event, any Roman citizen (a status most conquered people in the provinces lacked) had full legal rights and could literally appeal a conviction to the Emperor himself. When the missionary Paul of Tarsus mentioned he was a Roman citizen after being beaten during one of his missionary journeys without due process it was enough to put the public officials of the city into a minor panic. And the Roman administration treated him with great deference after his arrest during a riot in Jerusalem where the Jews were after his hide. (There's some fairly amusing "CYA" language between Roman officers and administrators over the discovery of Paul's status as a citizen in the Book of Acts.)  The Roman administration went to great lengths to protect Paul during his subsequent incarceration and appeal to Rome to preserve due process.
TL/DR: Powerful men have always had opportunity to abridge the civil rights of others, but generally Roman law and due process was strongly upheld even where powerful forces were at work.

I doubt it. In essence you'd be telling someone they aren't allowed to sell an item for $1. I think the worst that would come of it is that they'd demand exchanges and Tether.to not label it in a way that could cause confusion or mislead people into believing they are holding dollars when they are just owning tethers.

What you've posted here helped people understand why the audit is not easily done and how frustrations/tension could arise between Tether.to and the auditors, even without there being a fundamental problem. It's no secret Tether.to is using irregular banking channels to move and store dollars. That's the sort of thing that gives auditors fits, I imagine, and led to them demanding more and more details beyond what Tether.to could comply with (whether for good or bad reason). 
It highlights that there was a lot of $$ connected to Tether, which reduces the chances that they were just making up tether from thin air without corresponding dollar receipts. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:30:12

Some do. Most don't. (Bittrex, Polo, Binance, Cryptopia, Bitfinex etc.) They have huge problems with bank relationships and the regulatory overhead is crushing. That's why so many of the major altcoin exchanges don't deal in fiat. Tether is just much better and safer to work with from their perspective.

I suppose if it dragged out a bit it would impair the role of the Dollar as the global reserve currency in a modest fashion. Which would give a boost to any and all alternatives. Moreover if US markets got rattled cryptocurrency is one of the havens people would start moving money into.

Click on each coin in Coinmarketcap, go to the social media tab. You can research things more deeply from there.

Even at that level it wouldn't justify the "80%" number the fudders pulled out of thin air (the only justification I've seen for that number is screenshots of their chats indicating they sold out at $2000, which would explain where they wished they could buy back in.)
For all I know that amount of cash is counterfeit anyway, given I've heard of several sophisticated counterfeiting ops in recent years. 
If you think about it, unbacked tethers would essentially be counterfeit dollars. That says more about the USD than it says about Bitcoin (which cannot be counterfeited), and once the market digested that it would value each appropriately.

Despite some fud on that point, I'd say the answer is yes. I ran across a chart a little bit ago showing the increase and decrease of tethers over time.

Glossing over it and the other link provided below, they seem pretty vague about the "associated with illegal" terminology. It seems as if any transaction that is even vaguely linked to something associated with criminal activity is being counted. So you may be perfectly clean in your own activities with Bitcoin, but if you paid or tipped someone with Bitcoin and they spent it on Silk Road you might be lumped in as an illegal user.

In dollar value this may be bigger that Mt. Gox if the theft is confirmed. A couple thoughts:
1. While the industry obviously values immutability, when push comes to shove there is also a willingness to do rollbacks when the stakes are big enough (Vericoin, TheDAO/Ethereum). So don't be surprised if a rollback is done to reverse this theft on NEM.
2. Mt. Gox had a huge impact because it impacted the flagship of cryptocurrency and was a much bigger % of the total market cap. Now the market cap is dozens of times larger and it is a fairly obscure (despite its own market cap) altcoin that is primarily affected. 
So while the market reaction today makes sense, it will not lead to the kind of collapse we saw in 2014.

Well you are right, they do have a wire transfer option for USD and Euro! Separate from tether in both dollar and euro forms. 
The bad news is that they charge .1% of the withdrawal amount and have a $10,000 minimum. So I'm not going to do it on a lark. But next time I need to withdraw I'll keep in mind to compare BTC prices there and on Gemini and Coinbase, etc., and if it makes sense to pay the 0.1% I'll do so.

I'm not sure I understand you right. If by wire you mean a wire transfer to the exchange they are still dealing in fiat. And one advantage of Tether is that it can be transferred between exchanges. Any single exchange could create fictitious "US pseudo-dollars" strictly for accounting within their exchange, but people would have to trust them completely. I'm not sure I'd see a significant enough advantage to not using tether for such a purpose on an exchange, given it exists.

Take for example your belief that "it's always a church pastor or gop politician" engaged in pedophilia. I encourage you to do some thinking:
1. Why is it leftist groups that are trying to normalize and decriminalize pedophilia if it's all nasty right-wingers doing it? Do you see why this along makes your claim silly?
2. Why is pedophilia wrong? If there is no God your moral values are just you self-righteously trying to push your opinions on others, which is hypocritical and nonsensical.
3. Try actually researching the demographics of who commits pedophile crimes. 
We could do the same thing with all your other distorted and twisted claims. The Republicans are sinners and their leaders have a long list of faults. But they are nothing like the purity of evil now represented by the people they are opposing.

If they are able to earn any interest at all on the USD they have on deposit then they are making a killing.
Think about it, at 2% they'd be pulling in over $30 million a year right now with current deposits. Judging from what I've seen of their operation they probably aren't spending more than $2-3 million on staff and expenses (just a SWAG guess, I'll admit).
That's why I really don't get the evidence-free FUD from people who trash tether. There's an organized/full-time campaign against it by somebody (whoever's paying Bitfinex'd), but why is anyone's guess.

It's a bit unnerving how close it is to happening. People are enthused that Trump is serving as a firewall, but they forget how close the election was. The current crop of Democrat candidates is now unbelievably bonkers to the point that once the next Democrat is elected I have serious doubts I'll remain in the country. (And that would quite quite likely include moving an entire team of co-workers with me, but I think we're all likeminded enough the entire organization would move.) 
Socialist policies and centralized government bureaucracy are already unambiguously costing me well into six figures/year in lost income just for the privilege of calling myself an American. Combine that with the kind of slavery and depredations promised by Democrats and I'll be very quick to leave (I no longer own a house precisely for this reason). As capital and productive workers flee the US and it promotes suicidal policies you'll see it collapse much faster than most people imagine. I was born in Detroit - look at what's happened there for an idea of life under unfettered leftist rule in America.

These reports are garbage for several reasons. First off Tether has too small a market cap to play such a huge role. It was under $1B during the runup of BTC to 20K, for example.
I spent some time wargaming the Tether situation last night. In brief I see 3 possibilities:
1. The $$ is all there and the Tether admins are committed to running it fairly. We all know they are struggling with regular banking channels, and the headaches related to this led to the frustration with the auditors - basically like the news reports say. In this case there's no issue. I think this is the most likely situation.
2. Tether has a minor but non-catastrophic shortfall in their $ reserve. I think this is least likely because they already survived and contained an attempted $30M hack in November and were transparent about it. Even if there is a situation like this it is in the interest of many deep-pocketed whales and exchanges to provide them the necessary support, so I'm not worried about this either.
3. The final possibility is that they are totally faking it - they've received almost no $ but have been "printing" tethers right and left. This doesn't benefit them directly - they show huge liabilities on the books with no way to pay for them - so it would only be done at the behest of exchanges and whales who benefit from the run up in the price of BTC and whom they would supposedly be serving. But this requires all knowledgeable parties to keep a whopping big secret, something difficult to do in real life with more than an amputee's handful of people.
Even if there were a serious shortfall, the sheer value of tether to a large number of major exchanges means it would be in their best interest to collaborate and issue guarantees to underwrite it and clean up any mess. 
There's also evidence that the anti-tether social media crew are acting out of envy and/or poor market timing, having missed the boat or sold early in BTC's rise. There seems to be a concerted effort to constantly attack tether, and by extension the whole crypto market.

We have to adapt to what works. That means using LN to make regular transactions, and not fixating on earlier (mis)conceptions about how we'd use the blockchain for everyday purchases.

I work for a Christian organization that ministers to women enslaved by Hindu sex traffickers, children orphaned as their parents were killed in front of them by Atheist or Buddhist regimes, refugees who've lost everything due to Atheistic or Islamic violence, and so on. We are all sinners, so don't misunderstand me to say Christians do nothing wrong.

Bitcoin is released according to a fixed mining schedule. Yes, in principle everyone could agree to change the code to change the number of coins produced. But no, in reality, this will never happen.
1. A major attraction of Bitcoin is precisely that the coin supply is fixed. If that ever changes that attraction is _gone_ forever. 
2. Adding more coins would dilute the value of every existing coin. Making a change to bitcoin code requires concensus from Bitcoin stakeholders. Under what conceivable scenario would Bitcoiners vote to destroy the value of their own holdings?
I won't ever have to follow through on this, but suffice to say that if a push to increase the # of Bitcoins ever gained traction, I'd sell entirely out of Bitcoin ASAP and never look back. There's no reason whatever to ever do so and it would utterly destroy the principle of immutability and scarcity that forms much of the foundation of Bitcoin's value.

Satan has you in a muddle, but precisely because your beliefs are so bonkers and counter-reality you should be able to straighten yourself out simply by encountering reality.

True story: I spent a few months as a financial planner just out of college. One night I met a middle-aged guy who worked at a car shop and had pathetically little in the way of savings. I asked him what he was going to do for retirement and he invited me to come see his "retirement plan". 
We went back into his ordinary 2-car garage. It had a lift system in it so that the garage held 4 beautiful classic 60's muscle cars. That was his retirement plan.

The two have always gone hand in hand. There's no point in calling for some fantasy version of socialism when it is always the real world version that people actually get. When you centralize power to control distribution it is inevitable that the corrupt and ambitious will claw their way to the top and corrupt the promised socialist utopia to their own ends.
That's why decentralization is so important, and not just in Bitcoin. Criminal overlords in a free market system where there is competition can never hurt you as bad as in a socialist system when they have complete power over you.

That's perfectly wrong. You have it backwards - the amount expended to mine a bitcoin is governed by the value of bitcoin, not the other way around. As an example, if tomorrow a nasty bug is discovered by which extra bitcoins by the million can be created, the value will plummet to zero. But the cost to mine a bitcoin would only gradually decline in two week difficulty adjustment intervals.
Likewise if tomorrow a major government announces it is shifting its reserves into Bitcoin, Fidelity opens for crypto business and Warren Buffet does an about-face, the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket to, say, $100K. But the cost to mine Bitcoin would only gradually increase as miners scrambled to add more hardware, and again the two week adjustments would lock in the cost to mine a bitcoin in each two week cycle.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:04:36
People need to stop looking in the rear view mirror and look at the road ahead to judge whether Bitcoin is a good investment.
If it's a pump-and-dump with no real value, then yes it's a bad investment right now. But if it is a better form of value/money for significant economic purposes - such as being a digital gold for example, among other things - then it is on an S-curve to much greater value. I believe it is the latter.

Potting adds a fair amount of bulk/mass. Like dinkdink said the improvement would be marginal over a thorough (dip) coating. 
There might be a market for a potted version though, encased in a solid metal housing and advertised for extreme robustness. It would be bulky by comparison but that would be expected by the targeted market.
It does seem to me that potting can have problems with channels for water ingress opening between the PCB surface and the potting if not cured right. My memory is fuzzy on that since the incident I'm thinking of would have been 12-15 years ago. Anyway, probably not a factor so long as it is done right.

In principle any cryptocurrency has the potential to replace fiat due to their capability to change (within the context of each coins development process). That would include Bitcoin with offchain solutions, etc., as well as the others. IOTA's bugs can be fixed, centralized coins can take steps towards decentralization and so on. So the original point - that Fiat's survival cannot be taken for granted - still holds. There's just very little reason for individuals to prefer a centralized currency that is diluted/inflated by intention over ones that are not, whatever Keynesians may think.

I encourage you to actually visit a hospital in Cuba (preferably one not devoted to serving their elites). You'll see that article is loaded with lies or distortions very quickly (as has been documented elsewhere - for example they tend to kill off a lot of babies before birth that might give them problems, which artificially lowers the infant mortality rate).
I had a friend give birth in a Cuban hospital a few months ago. The rooms were filthy, the doctors and nurses were smoking in the corridors, and the bathroom unusable and disgusting. Meals were brought from home, as all Cubans know better than to risk ingesting hospital food if they can possibly avoid it. 
When our teams go in we routinely carry medicines requested by our contacts because the Cuban health services provide so little. For example some medication for a young woman who was suffering from serious arthritis pain, and for whom the government "healthcare" service was doing nothing.

BTG and BCH are basically both scamcoins riding on BTC's coattails. With zero fees and nearly limitless capacity IOTA, a DAG coin like IOTA offers tremendous potential despite it's "alpha" stage development. It's not ready for prime time, but the recent price movement shows a lot of people don't want to be late investing in it if it pans out.
I've tripled my "BTC equivalent" in crypto holdings this year by ignoring Bitcoin maximalists. If you want to just HODL Bitcoin, fine, but it's not the only game in town. Ironically the maximalists sound towards other cryptocurrencies just like bankers when they talk about Bitcoin.

The difficulty adjusts to keep the rate blocks are solved constant. So the schedule of mining rewards is more-or-less fixed. (The actual rate of mining actually runs a bit faster than the "official" schedule of 10 minute blocks because of the growth in hashrate between each adjustment period. So instead of the last satoshi being mined in 2140, for example, it might actually be more like ~2130 to 2135.)

Glad it is working out OK for you!
I work in the automotive industry, so let me offer one slight correction: Ford had the foresight to secure deep lines of credit ahead of 2008, so when Chrysler and GM collapsed into bankruptcy, Ford was able to survive (barely).
A lot of people talk about missed opportunities in not investing earlier in cryptocurrency. For me the great miss was not investing in a basket of automotive stocks at the nadir of 2008. I used to receive a daily newsletter in my email with prices of 25 automotive stocks. I clearly remember how at one point 7 of the 25 were bankrupt, and only two (Toyota and Honda) were down by a "sane" amount. The rest - every single one - was down between 80 and 99%, with most around 95%. For example my company had dropped from just over $40 to $1.34. 
I could have made a killing on the rebound, but after watching co-workers get cut in 6 separate waves of layoffs and then getting temporarily laid off when my primary customer (Chrysler) went bankrupt, I was in no mood to do anything dramatic with my investments. But if I ever get a 2nd chance...

Audacity tends to pay off in Crypto. Until things go south.
A few weeks ago I was daydreaming about striking it rich with Stellar. In my daydream Stellar was headed for parity with Ripple and I caught on early and began relentlessly margin buying it on Polo, cashing out the margin position every 20% gain to dive right back in with the amplified amount. 
As it turns out reality has basically been tracking to my daydream. If I'd had the audacity to have done it with the amounts I was contemplating I'd not only have submitted my 2 weeks notice at work I'd be talking to lawyers about setting up a private charitable foundation.

This is a bit over the top fearmongering.
For one thing, note the dramatic prediction that Bitcoin electricity use will match the USA by mid-2019 and the rest of the world just months later. As the article notes recent bitcoin power use was = 3 million US households. Let's say that was at $15,000. 
Gold parity is around $375,000 (roughly), or 25X the current price of Bitcoin. Even if BTC skyrocketed to that level in short order that would only be 75 million households. And that's not likely in just 18 months, no matter how excited we are right now. 
Beyond that we'd be talking about Bitcoin being more than a store of value, with it replacing fiat currencies in major applications. I would expect such growth to take place much more slowly. In the meantime the halvening in early-mid 2020 would cut the block reward in half, with a comparable drop in hashrate as a result.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:04:27
Tell that to all the countries whose fiat hyperinflated to worthlessness. Yes, the paper bills existed, but that's small solace to those who used them for toilet and wall paper. The fact that a government accepts it does not give it value, it just makes it easy for people to dump the fiat on the government if no one else is accepting it at that point.
There have already been some small jurisdictions accepting Bitcoin and that will no doubt grow.

Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies could replace government-issued currency, but that is not necessary for it to be successful in the long run. It could take on a function similar to gold, for example, without replacing cash for day-to-day transactions.
A MAJOR point of Bitcoin is precisely that it is free of the manipulation that central-bank currencies are subject to. If you want inflation stick with your Zimbabwean dollars. Bitcoin will never inflate, because anyone who insists on suggesting such a thing will be beaten into the ground by the first pack of bitcoiners who can find them. (I'm only half joking.)
About 80% of Bitcoins have been mined, BTW.

Welcome aboard!!
1. No, Coinbase is not _that_ bad. Most exchanges right now have a fair number of people upset with them for one reason or another, basically due to the rapid growth of the exchanges and difficulty growing fast enough, without compromising security, to handle the new customers and the support tickets they generate. (That said, I find Gemini has better support, though you get a better deal doing ACH transfers to Coinbase and then setting limit orders on GDAX to buy your BTC, then withdrawings from GDAX for free.)
2. A hardware wallet sounds like the best solution in your case, assuming you've bought enough BTC to be worth the ~$100 investment.
3. There are tons of resources out there. Check out the sidebar at the right. Here are a few others:

I think you'll find it the opposite if you actually investigate. Liberty provides the opportunity for wealth creation, because people are more motivated when the fruits of their labors are not being stolen from them. At the same time, liberty is rooted in a theistic conception of man created in the image of God, and thus having value in himself and not as a mere slave of whomever can seize power. And that same worldview leads to personal charity as an expression of God's love - real charity, not giving to make yourself feel better or to buy votes. 
I always gave at least 15% of my income for charity, and I'm in the process of launching a private foundation right now that should kick my giving dramatically higher from this time forth. Yet I expect I'll forever be getting lectured from ignorant "liberals" who give almost nothing from their own income but are full of plans of how to spend other people's money on their own personal agendas.

Bitcoin forks from Bcash forward have all been scams. Altcoins in general are a mixed bag.

So you don't believe your own posts exist, because they are information (the same as bitcoin). 
Those of us who got into BTC years ago did so for philosophical/ideological reasons. For me it was having some free time to ponder the nature of money and what made for sound money the week between Christmas and New Years in 2013. I started a chart (ironically very similar to one I've since seen here on this sub's sticky) with Gold and Fiat(Dollars). I started filling it out and issuing grades for various criteria I came up with.
Then I added a 3rd column for something I just heard about, Bitcoin. I'm sure I heard about it because it was in the news due to the China bubble, but it wasn't the price that initially interested me but the ideology behind it. I did research, came up with grades, then stared at the results. By the end of January I had my own mining rig, and the rest was history.
So I agree with the thrust of your critique - people need to be more concerned with the philosophical and ideological underpinnings than the daily price. But don't get hung up on what's "real" in an era in which most dollars are just non-cryptographically secured electronic bits and bitcoins are cryptographically secured bits. It's all quite real, same as the information in these posts.

Yes, since GDAX is the in-house exchange for Coinbase. I should mention: You can transfer funds free and instant between Coinbase and GDAX. If you set limit orders on GDAX there is 0% fee when they are filled. And then when you withdraw BTC from GDAX they cover the TX fee as well! (So never ever withdraw crypto from Coinbase directly - people waste their BTC all the time because they don't realize this.)
Edit: Also, when you buy on Coinbase you pay a set markup % for the convenience. It only takes a few seconds to transfer the funds to GDAX from the menu on the GDAX website.

It's one thing to say Bitcoin will correct heavily at some point. It's another thing entirely to correctly predict when. It will be small solace to the shorter if they open a short position at 12,000 and get liquidated, only to see it hit 20,000 in a month and then crash to 5,000.

Coinbase is not an exchange. All exchanges offer instant buying and selling. The delay you mention is the delay in getting funds to the exchange (or whatever you want to call Coinbase) in the first place.

We do have a serious scaling problem now, thanks to the delays forced by the bch cartel. Until the LN is functional we'll just have to be smart about transactions and keep them to a minimum. I suggest using a non-scammy alternate like Litecoin or Stellar for moving small amounts in the interim.

(The double hit of coming off the late 2013 China bubble and then Mt. Gox collapsing would be very difficult to repeat today. No exchange comes even close to Mt. Gox's dominance, they have much better security so a dramatic hack and collapse is less likely, and China's already banned exchanges right now anyway.)

I don't know for sure, but it's easy to imagine they are setting up a lot of off-chain solutions. For example, when I buy stuff at Amazon using Purse.io I've noticed that Purse has instant BTC transfers from Coinbase.

That keeps all the TX off-chain.

They are welcome to use Bitcoin and a thousand other cryptocurrencies that already exist. Yet instead they choose to create another? Why? Because they have some unique technical need that no other crypto fulfills? Of course not. The answer is: Control.
And that's precisely what makes Maduro's proposed government-issued crypto worthless. All economic transactions involve 2 or more parties. But if one of those parties has sole control over the currency used they will forever have an incentive to manipulate it to their advantage, and the other party will thus be unable to trust it.

I basically agree with you that a crash like three years ago is very unlikely. That crash was a 1-2 blow:
1. The China bubble topping out and popping; then:
2. Mt. Gox collapsing.
The first caused a sharp drop and strong oscillations, but if Gox had not happened the price would likely have basically stabilized a little under $1000. It was the building drama of people being unable to withdraw from Gox for weeks on end, followed by their total collapse, that created waves of negative media and lasting negative sentiment that took a year to recover from.
And notice that it took a year for the crash to fully play out. So it's not like we're likely to have a crash faster than you can react to.
Today not even Japan has the kind of dominant position that Chinese buyers did in the fall of 2013. And no exchange is anywhere near as significant as Mt. Gox was. Security practices are better, and there are more investors waiting and demonstrating they will buy the dips. 
So for the kind of crash we saw three years ago, we need a huge event, and lasting, sustained negative news coverage that overshadows everything else relentlessly for weeks on end. This is possible, but not likely. More likely we'll see a leveling off of the trajectory over time, with corrections and pullbacks that are short-lived compared to 2014. At least until some really bad news comes along instead of the flow of innovation and good news that has dominated 2017.

Nice of the Pirate Bay to recognize what's legit and what should not be given the time of day, even if it costs them a little.

They kept things moving pretty well in my case - I don't think more than 2-3 days passed with the ball in their court at any point. Things might be even busier now but hopefully they can stick to that. It was pleasant given the weeks/months to respond that I've gotten used to on other exchanges (if they don't flat out cancel tickets with no action). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:59:24
They've had especially poor customer service for ages (all the exchanges are strained to capacity but they've been the worst in my experience and many others). 
They also were in the forefront of the Bitcoin NYA takeover attempt, and have been dragging their feet far beyond any plausible excuse when it comes to implementing Segwit to reduce transaction fees on the network. The fact that they are prioritizing the BCash scamcoin over getting Segwit rolled out speaks volumes.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:30:19
I love the revisionist lies you people keep coming up with. You Bcash cultists fought to block scaling Bitcoin for as long as you could, and then have the chutzpah to blame the people who have worked hard to scale it against your bitter obstructionism. 
Bcash was abruptly declared by the Ver/Wu/Wright cartel in July 2017 only after the efforts to obstruct Segwit finally came unglued and it became clear it could not be stopped. That's an obvious and not very distant historical fact. Now it's just a question of how many naive and stupid people are out there for you to fleece before it collapses.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:34:45
Unutilized scamcoins will tend to have cheap fees, yes. But there are plenty of legit coins with higher capacity than Bcash and lower fees, so there's just literally no point to your scamcoin. Dogecoin or Stellar or IOTA are far less toxic and offer better capacity, and are faster to boot, for example.

Heaviest buying has been among Koreans and on Japanese exchanges. While it is conceivable U.S. banks have been sneaky and bought their BTC on those markets at inflated prices in order to dump at a massive loss to profit on their short positions, it's more likely the buying has been real consumer interest. Banks that try to short it may find themselves on the wrong side of a steamroller that chooses not to stop on Dec. 10-11.

Nonsense. A few are competitors (most are carving out niches that Bitcoin has nothing to do with), but on a broad scale they are obvious allies against the traditional financial system.

It's something I'm trying to work on, but it turns out to be miserably complicated in practice. You spend a lot of time doing verifications on a dozen exchanges, reading fine print about all the daily/weekly/monthly limits(which suck for an arbitrager), mapping out the trading fees and the withdrawal fees for crypto and tether and wire transfers and so forth, so you can calculate how much cost there is involved in each paired set of trades for the arbitrage. 
I think when all is said and done I'll be able to take advantage of some opportunities, but I've put a lot of effort into it for the past month and have only done one small trial. It will be weeks more at least before I expect to be doing it much. And I'm only working with USD for fiat.

(I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't see smart contracts for Bitcoin as a good thing; it conflicts with Bitcoin's flagship status as a store of value. Besides, Stellar has been pointing out that it has dramatically cheaper TX and better capacity than Ethereum, and no doubt the same is true vs. Bitcoin.)

On the contrary, it's the people who bought bitcoin and then forgot about it who have done the best with their investing. Anyone who wants to play market timer ends up losing at some point and just feeds exchanges with fees. 
I'm curious what you would suggest as "better options" than Bitcoin for this kind of timeframe. Of course there's risk with everything and hindsight is 20-20, but if anyone had made such a gift in Bitcoin in 2011-2016 they've be pretty happy so far.

I got involved in January 2014, mining alts to trade into Bitcoin. I spent that first year asking myself over and over "Is something fundamentally broken?"
The answer stayed no, so after a year of mining I doubled down and made some modest purchases of Bitcoin near the lows in 2015 and 2016. It's a matter of sticking to the fundamentals and keeping your head despite your emotions.

Bitcoins are broken down into 100,000,000 satoshis per Bitcoin. Very few people will be transacting with 1 Bitcoin or more in the future, just various amounts of satoshis. So mentally adjust to that new frame of reference.
Bitcoin has been on a steep upward climb (with occasional severe corrections) for nine years. This reflects the steady movement towards mass adoption, solution of technical problems like scalability, and recognition of its superiority over competition like gold as a store of value (which, even if it has no other use, implies a value of hundreds of thousands of dollars per Bitcoin). 
It could fall steeply tomorrow on some bout of very bad news, but the overall trend should give confidence that if you hold long enough you will come out ahead. As it reaches its ultimate utility we can expect the trendline to get shallower, but no one is arguing that it's final value is around $16,000/bitcoin. It's either worth nothing in the future (if competition is superior) or a great deal more.

Heck, the news today about Bulgaria accidentally finding itself with Bitcoin equal to 20% of its national debt is a sort of accidental version of this. If it leads to other nations racing to secure some before the price goes stratospheric... it will make 2017 look like a mere prelude.
(In other news, if BTC keeps soaring a major geopolitical issue of 2018 will be dealing with the rolling blackouts that are starting to happen due to bitcoin mining. I'm serious. If you thought Bcash shills were bad, wait until governments start approaching devs about the "PoW problem".)

No. A true free market is not anarchy, and libertarians are not anarchists. Unfortunately there are a lot of ignorant "libertarians" out there (I'm older than most) who are mostly just naïve anarchists. 
You will never maintain liberty without appreciating that the threat to it comes from two directions, not one: There is the risk of evil behavior from those in power over you, and the risk of evil behavior from your peers around you.
The anarchists are all about preventing people from having power over you, to defeat the first problem. But as any glance at the real world shows an environment without authority becomes a hell-hole very quickly. 
So real libertarianism also balances the need for legitimate law enforcement with the need to limit the strength and power of that law enforcement and making it accountable. 
The risk of insiders perpetually abusing their position to profit on trading at the expense of the general public is a real one, and left unchecked would rapidly destroy all trust in financial institutions (which would then lead to more apocalyptic things). So the defense of liberty requires vigorous law enforcement against such activity. The trick is doing it without establishing a police state.

Transfer it into an IRA. Then contact Broad Financial for a self-directed IRA account. It costs a bit but the flat fee is better than the percentage other self-directed IRA firms take if you have a non-trivial amount. 
They'll help you set up an LLC investment company, and then send your LLC a check for your IRA. Presto! You can now invest your IRA in pretty much anything (subject to IRS limitations) including the range of cryptocurrency. 
Tip: You can even get an account on Bitfinex, otherwise closed to US customers, doing this. That's handy if you want to lend to margin traders for additional income or do margin trading yourself.

You have the right idea. When bitcoins are mined and then subsequently transacted, either the whole block reward may be spent or it may be (and likely is) broken into chunks. Over time those chunks get more and more broken down and recombined. 
Let's say you have a wallet with 5 bitcoins worth in it, that  came in amounts of 3, 1.5 and 0.5 bitcoins. You decide to spend 1.2 bitcoins. What your wallet does is look up the TX for your receipt of the 1.5 bitcoin and send an outgoing TX that says "take 1.2 bitcoins from the 1.5 and send to the recipient, and send the other 0.3 bitcoins to a new address in my wallet." This new address is called a change address.
You can actually trace the history of your bitcoins using a block explorer, seeing how they came from different TX and have been combined and divided over time.  You might be surprised to find how old some bits of your bitcoin are, and how recent others are.

Bitcoin is currently optimized as a store of value, with a goal to making it a cash replacement via LN. (I believe this is a fundamental error, but I won't get into that now.)
Yes, Bitcoin "can" pivot to do other things, but if you optimize for one you lose other things. And yes you can try building layers on it, but those layers are new efforts just like other coins are new efforts, and the other coins have a head start at this point. 
So look at the Coinmarketcap list. It's actually very difficult to find coins that are really in competition with Bitcoin at this point. Bcash, of course, and Nano for cash payments. Beyond that most coins have separate niches. Smart contracts, prediction markets, exchange tokens, stablecoins, IoT tokens, privacy coins, digital asset tokens for many settings, supply chain tokens, and so forth are each best pursued on blockchains optimized for each function, not on a jack-of-all trades platform.

This is true. Literally every day there are companies being founded that will go on to enjoy at least modest success. Every day you could pick some company that will skyrocket in the next 5 or 10 years and make whomever puts a little money in now into a fortune.
Yet somehow we don't have people living in a state of depression over the endless missed opportunities of the stock market like we have people kicking themselves over bitcoin. 
If you heard of Bitcoin before now, stop kicking yourself if you didn't invest. That solves nothing. Just get some skin in the game and stop living in the past.

Hopefully this indicates we are approaching the bottom of the bear cycle. Alts tend to lag Bitcoin both up and down. You can see this in the peaks of Bitcoin in December 2017 versus most of the alts peaking 2-3 weeks later, at which point Bitcoin dominance was at a record low. Now things are reversed - Bitcoin is up a bit from the 5700-6000 floor, but the alts are capitulating.
The guy who said "all in doge" may have the right idea, since most alts tend to outperform bitcoin in the rallies.

It's FUD by someone who hates Bitfinex and is getting sued over it for their spreading FUD - Coindesk has an article about it today.
I basically consider it gibberish because the idea that any exchanges are insolvent after a year of dramatic growth in # of users, and dramatic growth in the value of the cryptos fees being collected, is not very sane. 
Tether clearly has banking problems, but that's not the same as saying the dollars don't exist on account. To date I've seen zero evidence of them running a fractional reserve. 
Full disclosure: I was skyping a Tether contact earlier today about wiring money into/out of one of my Tether accounts for the first time. He expressed openness to my doing either a withdrawal or deposit when I was ready (I plan to start with a withdraw, followed by a deposit, in the weeks ahead). My problem right now is that they had a hack 2 weeks ago that has resulted in accounts being frozen.

Pro tip for future 2FA setups: Have a backup device like an old phone or tablet handy, and scan the setup barcode with it as well as  your main phone. Then store it someplace safe. (And also record the seed in a safe place as well).
This way when the inevitable happens and your phone is lost/destroyed, you'll have a backup device immediately available. 
Note that Google authenticator seeds are NOT backed up with default cloud backups. You'll get your app restored if something happens, but without any of the account 2FAs.

We had over a year-long delay in scaling Bitcoin due to what turned out to be malicious scammers trying to hijack it and keep monopolistic control over all transactions. The first step in scaling (Segwit) was introduced in August but needs to be enabled by each exchange and wallet provider. Some of the major ones (like Coinbase) have dragged their heels or have been in collusion with the scammers who copied Bitcoin and are pushing their counterfeit. So Segwit is helping, but it's not enough in the face of skyrocketing popularity.
The real solution at this point is the Lightning Network which will provide massive off-chain scaling and great competition to handle TX with minimal fees. The LN is in beta with good progress but needs to be rock-solid before deployment on something as valuable as the  Bitcoin network. Here's some reading to help you understand better:

What in that one line of mine implied any emotion at all?
Actually you'll find in my posting history that I consistently believe the future belongs to a host of cryptocurrencies, all optimized for various financial niches. And it's looking to me like Bitcoin will be the store of value and others will take on more cash-oriented roles.  LN could prove me wrong. But in any case your designation "Bitcoin Cash" for Bcash - abusing the Bitcoin brand name with an impostor - shows I was right on the money in responding to your statement. 
Dash, Litecoin or dozens of others have a legitimate chance at playing the role of cash to Bitcoin's "gold." Bcash is just a fraud and a scam. There are enough of us who care about newbies and will relentlessly hound it's fraudulent marketers to ensure that newbies learn to avoid it like the plague.

Compare Bitcoin to the centralized government alternatives. The dollar is sure to go down in value from inflation, and at some point will likely hyperinflate due to attempts to cope with government deficits.

Yes, they do try to limit inflation. But note that raising interest rates means the government has to pay more interest on its debt. And it has a _lot_ of debt. The central bank dares not raise interest rates to the point that it becomes a mortal danger to the government. If the government's debt begins to spiral out of control due to rising interest costs that will lead to a crisis as surely as if the central bank let hyperinflation kick in without a fight.

You coin would be worth nothing because it isn't scarce and is being obviously manipulated. So your claim that miners are going to favor your coin is false. They have to mine the fork that has value.

It's comical you imagine this would work.

Ironically, that's where Bitcoin becomes a destabilizing element. So long as the only alternatives to, say, the Dollar were the Yen, Euro and so forth, there wasn't much point fleeing one debt-burdened fiat currency for another. But as Bitcoin becomes a viable alternative for capital flight the risk to the old centrally managed currencies increases. What would 2008 have been like if people could have fled to Bitcoin at that time? What will happen when 2008 repeats, and this time Bitcoin is ready?

The price is a reflection of the constant ebbing and flowing of orders by buyers and sellers of bitcoin. When there is more interest in selling than buying the price is driven down, and vice versa when there is more interest in buying into bitcoin. 
Traders are constantly watching for price differences between exchanges and many are set up for arbitrage, so if a price difference appears they will sell on the higher priced exchange and buy on the lower priced exchange until the difference becomes negligible. This keeps the price pretty similar across exchanges.
Traders may or may not know about OTC trades. A big reason for OTC trading is to enable whales to trade bitcoin without slippage, without causing a big shift in price. 
The actual price across exchanges (averaged by volumes) is the "true price" of bitcoin - it is a reflection of the consensus of the market at any given point in time. An individual may opine that it should be more or less, but the market price is what matters and reflects the opinion of everyone participating in trading bitcoin, rather than just one person or a small group.

It cannot prevent all poor decisions, but it can prevent some games from being played. For as long as fiat currency has been around, politicians have overspent (or funneled money to croneys/themselves/etc.) and rather than face angry taxpayers they've kicked the can down the road by relying on deficit spending. 
A world dominated by cryptocurrencies is a world where that would be severely curtailed. They could go into debt, but without inflation to subtly shift the burden from government to savers the governments would be held much more accountable.

So by your logic you'll be the biggest booster of bitcoin after it has an up day? That's a silly way to evaluate its value. Look at the trend of the dollar over the past century since it became fiat currency. Then look at the trend of bitcoin since it's creation. Then look at measurables like inflation rate, debt, growth in monetary supply for each and so on. BTC's only competition is from other crypto - the government currencies at this point are a joke by comparison.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:19:54
The relationship is that the mining costs will gravitate towards the trading price of Bitcoin. Not the other way around. If the market values Bitcoin at $10,000 and it currently costs $5,000 to mine a bitcoin then miners will invest in more hardware to increase their profits - until because of competition it costs $10,000 for them to mine a bitcoin. In principle the reverse will happen if it costs $10K to mine a bitcoin only worth $5K. In that case marginal miners will shut down until the cost matches the value of a Bitcoin.
Of course this is a constantly moving target, so it's not this simple in real life. Every miner has their own costs, based on their hardware costs, electricity, operations, building rental, salaries and so on.
But anyone who claims the price of bitcoin moves towards the cost of mining one has it completely backwards. It's a question of market supply and demand, with fixed supply and elastic demand. And no one on the demand side cares what it cost a miner to produce a bitcoin. It's completely irrelevant for us.
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:06:17
It's all sentiment-driven (emotions). Let's say Upbit was insolvent and running a fractional  reserve operation. Shutting that down would in effect be reducing the number of bitcoins available for trading, since they would have been artificially inflating the number. But sentiment trumps the raw economics, and no one likes to see bad news about exchange shenanigans, or even the possibility thereof. Let's hope they can put this to bed quickly and prove there is nothing going on.

The central bank is not the source of the problem though. As a government runs larger and larger deficits their interest payments rise. At that point either they become responsible, curtail spending and start paying down the debt... or they lean on the central bank to run the printing presses and dilute the value of the government's debt. But doing so runs the risk of people losing faith in the currency when they see its value being destroyed, which can set off hyperinflation as they rush to spend or dispose of the currency.
Obviously central banks don't want this, but they never choose this situation. It's forced on them by government mismanagement. The temptation for politicians is to buy votes with government spending and always to kick the can down the road and let someone else deal with the deficit later, rather than angering taxpayers before the next election.
There are usually a fair number of politicians and bankers responsible enough to try to ward off the final crisis, and people don't want to panic and cause hyperinflation, so there are usually a number of minor crises before the final one. But in the end it only takes one screwup or uncontainable economic shock (such as we nearly faced in 2008) to lead to hyperinflationary oblivion. So I figure sooner or later every government currency will screw up, it's just a question of how long their lifespan will be.

In principle yes. But the next worst thing to a hyperinflationary economic collapse is a bankrupt, financially insolvent government. So the central bank is under heavy pressure to prevent the latter, and if it doesn't handle a situation just right trying to prop up salvage the government's finances by diluting its debt is what will trigger the hyperinflation.

You show a pretty strong prejudice when you arbitrarily declare anyone involved with cryptocurrency creation "small groups of criminals." Do I get to win an argument by describing the Fed members that way?
Bitcoin scarcity is fixed FAR more strongly than the scarcity of dollars. Dollar scarcity is simply a function of Federal Reserve voting, and they vote to inflate the money supply regularly, with the result that it has lost 98% of its value over the past century.
In order to change the Bitcoin mining schedule you would need to get the majority of the nodes to adopt the change. That's easy to say, in much the same way that "let's go to Mars" is easy to say. The hard part is getting a majority of people to adopt a change that would dilute the value of their Bitcoins. So as a practical matter there's no risk whatever of Bitcoin losing value this way.
Your last lines betray a complete absence of understanding about how Bitcoin works. The miners are not in control (as they found out last year). If they don't like the fee market, tough, they can drop out and quit mining. People won't dilute their holdings just to placate miners greed.
Centralized fiat currencies are dying. You can put a brave face on it, but fewer and fewer people are going to trust their wealth to centralized systems that have a long track record of being manipulated and diluted, now that we have an alternative. The Mungers and Buffetts of the 20th century are mocked, not admired, by the millenials on this subject. As they move up the economic ladder and the older generations die off the government currencies will wither and die.

(Piggycoin could use support, but more in the form of volunteers helping put together simple webpages and educational tools like quizzes, crosswords and handouts, IMO. It's one of the ways "normal" folks could get involved with helping crypto develop without needing to be a cutting edge blockchain coder.)

I realize there are a lot of newbies here who have no idea what has been going on. I absolutely agree with you (when I started in crypto in 2014 I was dismayed by overuse of the word "scam" and railed against it). I assure you, if I had a stronger word than scam without being vulgar I'd be using it instead. Francesco Firano stole over $100K from me, but if I a choice between punching him and punching Roger Ver, the latter would win, no contest.
bcash outrages happen daily, so just keep your eyes open and keep learning. Read both sides until you realize who is thoroughly full of crap. It really shouldn't be hard.
This is just a tiny sliver. All you really need to do is consistently read both sides until you see for yourself they are completely off the deep end in the bcash camp. I have differences of opinion with pretty much everyone in one way or another, but bcash is in a world completely its own when it comes to hypocrisy, malice, manipulation, scamming and fraud.

Mining cost is a function of what share a miner's hashrate is compared to total mining hashrate, and the cost to produce that hashrate (cost of hardware, electricity, salaries, building rental and so on). Mining revenue, on the flip side, is a function of the bitcoin reward per block and the fees associated with transactions in each block.
Over short timeframes the revenue (as measured in bitcoins!) is fairly fixed (and will roughly halve every four years). So miners profitability is going to be based on their cost and competition. When you speak of the difficulty adjustment and the increased competition you are basically speaking of the same thing, since the difficulty adjustments are a reflection of the changes in hashrate based on what the overall competition is doing (adding or removing mining hardware).

Printing dollars to pay off the debt is precisely what would lead to hyperinflation:
1. Massive print run to pay off massive debt leads to
2. Massive increase in money supply, diluting the value of each dollar, leading to
3. People flocking to buy anything denominated in dollars as they realize what is happening, leading to
4. Continuing erosion of the value of each dollar as no one wants to hold a depreciating asset, leading to
5. Even faster dumping of dollars as it becomes critical to shift out of dollars as fast as you get them to avoid losing value holding them for even a short length of time.
This is basic stuff. Printing excessive dollars destroys faith that they are scarce, which destroys their value. You are absolutely correct in your other post - you should flee holding an asset that is a pyramid scheme because it has no real value and is not scarce, being subject to manipulation on any whim. It is called the U.S. Dollar (or the Swiss franc, etc.)

It is an easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin with traditional IRA's and so forth (I had a Roth IRA with it from 2015-2017). 
You can also do self-directed IRA's through several outfits like Broad Financial that let you directly invest your IRA funds into crypto. Of course you should do this with prudence (have enough set aside that even if you lost it all in crypto you'd be OK). I started one in 2017 and it's good knowing I am in direct control of my own funds.

Better competition all around, bloating blockchain, centralized governance, sitting at the epicenter of government scrutiny of ICOs and scams among other things. It's had a great run, but every time the media talks about them having a plethora of options to move forward (sharding! raiden network! bigger blocks! casper! plasma!) it's apparent that they don't really know what to do to fix things, and they are fast running out of time. They needed to have this worked out some time ago to avoid a train wreck.
It's really a shame, because I'm afraid the fallout from this could trigger a general crypto bear market that would suck down coins totally unaffected apart from market sentiment.

Amazon would have shut them down a long time ago if that was particularly a problem. I've used Purse a couple dozen times, the only time I had trouble Purse reimbursed me when Amazon unilaterally and without warning canceled some gift cards I'd bought via Purse. Amazon was completely uncooperative and uncommunicative all through repeated phone and email communications with them, whereas Purse was very responsive once I went to them.
Purse is acting totally out in the open and even has a bricks-and-mortar store in California, so if there were something systemically wrong with their service I have to believe Amazon would be burying them in lawsuits by now.

Blockchain.info keeps coming up in the news for security issues like this. A few months ago there was a white hat hacker grabbing BTC (later returned to the affected people) due to a R-value bug they had, before actual thieves could get the funds.

Well, since Bitcoin is decentralized there is little point in complaining about it as a whole, since there is no one who is "in charge" to fix it.

Bitcoin hadn't hit the capacity cap in 2013 driving people offchain. The bitcoin dominance index dropped to 72% overnight (slightly recovered now), a record low. The major alts (Ethereum, Dash, Monero) have superior "customer performance" metrics on things like speed, fees, anonymity,  and smart contracts.
Purse announces they are adding support for these alts; Coindesk reports institutional interest in Ethereum investments. Payment processors and exchanges announce fee increases on bitcoin use and increased minimums for invoicing, etc. 
Things are moving fast now - except in bitcoin capacity where things are not moving at all. HODL if you want (I'm keeping some fraction of my BTC, to be sure), but don't kid yourself that bitcoin automatically gets to stay as  if nothing changes.

Tax deferral. I have my own bitcoin wallets, but 90% of my savings is in retirement accounts.
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:20:18
Because Coinbase and others are already signaling that it is too risky to deal with the BU altcoin. I know the BU echo chamber would like to believe otherwise, but getting a bunch of miners on your side is not the same thing as getting the market on your side. 
BU can grab 90% of the hashrate, but if the market says it does not like the hostile takeover and wants to move forward technologically with segwit/LN, then the price of bitcoin will remain high while the BU coin will tank. At that point the BU miners can either keep mining at a loss, or switch back to bitcoin as the more profitable option.
Once the defections start, expect them to continue until the bitcoin blockchain surpasses BU, at which point the BU altcoin ceases to exist. Just the risk of this happening is strong enough to prejudice the market (i.e., ordinary people like me) strongly against Bitcoin Unlimited's hostile takeover tactics. The diehards will then face humiliation and the evaporation of their chain and all the value poured into it. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:41:45
Why convergence on a single value? Why not the development of multiple factions with convergence of each faction to different values, leading to a multipolar distribution? (Not that anything like that would happen among bitcoiners, erhhh....)
For example, suppose a dominant cabal of miners pushes for large blocks that struggling miners cannot cope with. Whether they need 51% or 95% concensus doesn't change what happens, only the speed with which marginal miners are run out of mining. 
Only it doesn't happen once. It works so well (leading to increased profits among the remaining miners), that the leading miners do it over, and over, and over again, like some awful game of Survivor until mining is utterly centralized.
Why won't this happen with what BU is pushing?

Are you serious yourself? You don't actually rebut anything, just waving your hands.

@_date: 2017-03-25 14:36:11
No. That is how NOTHING works unless you live under a communist/socialist government where prices are controlled. Bitcoin is traded on the free market so prices instantly react to supply/demand conditions. That includes anticipation of changes, which is what drives the model I describe above.
If a fork occurs people will be able to start placing buy/sell orders as fast as the exchanges can list both coins (minutes if they have prepared as they should have). Expect heavy dumping on both sides (sell side pressure) with lack of immediate demand as uncertainty and expectation of lower prices on both halves drive lack of demand (buying). I expect that the sum of the prices of the two coins will be much lower than the price beforehand in the initial wave of selling.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:32:38
It is almost certainly one side or the other, and it is the BU folks who have been very noisy lately about trying to force the issue. They feel they have momentum, so it makes no sense for a Core supporter to do this (unless calculating that BU really will implode if they go active.)

Yes - miners need to be realistic. I was reviewing computer specs yesterday, and it looks like in general 2017 systems are only about 2X the speed/storage/throughput of my 2009 system. And industry roadmaps show we are reaching the end of scaling with existing technologies. 
In other words, Moore's Law is dead, and has been for some time. It is not realistic to imagine the blockchain scaling to some enormous level as adoption increases.

Not beyond waiting for SW to take hold. And that mystifies me. If BU was purely a proposal to shift to a larger block (2 or 4, maybe 8 max) and not a governance change shifting power to miners I'd favor it (also assuming it had competent devs), while still wanting to push forward with offchain TX via the LN, etc. 
Core has mismanaged the situation, allowing the current threat to develop. But that doesn't mean I'll blindly throw my lot in with any alternative. I'm very confident that a BU hardfork will lead to failure, while also badly damaging the Core blockchain if it even survives. That's why I made my unprecedented shift to alts the last two weeks. I just do not see a realistic scenario right now where BTC does well or holds up in the face of competition.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:02:16
They have a fiduciary responsibility here. I've seen on /btc how they are refusing to consider this, in what I can only understand to be breathtaking arrogance. It's one thing to fairly compete with Core, another to try to kill them off so they can't compete. This is a miners vs. investors battle, and the miners are about to get themselves slaughtered if they pull the trigger.
The good news is, anyone interested in buying a ton of mining hardware cheap is going to have a field day after all the bankruptcies in China.

Be careful, Moore's Law has been dead for some time. I was comparing specs on my 2009 system (fairly robust for its time) with new options, and at best there has been a 2X increase in storage/speed for most things in 8 years. Not 1.5 years as in Moore's Law. And if you google the subject, industry roadmaps for the coming few years are even more bleak. There are refinements but not breakthroughs.
So we need to be conservative in our estimation of future storage capacities and what we can pack into a blockchain.

Meanwhile the alts are soaring, merchants are announcing they are accepting alts, institutional investors are looking into ethereum and so on. I looked at what it would cost to empty my wallet yesterday and the median fee was .082 BTC. 
The miners are playing with fire if this continues. Alts are MUCH cheaper and faster now to transact with. And the miners can't switch over to them due to the difference in algorithms. If something else becomes the flagship of crypto and bitcoin stays slow, bottlenecked and lacking the features of newer cryptos, the bitcoin mining industry will be crushed.

What level of support would be required to trigger the UASF? 51%? Or is it variable (and if so what factors would be involved?)
If I understand it correctly, the UASF is driven by nodes requiring segwit once activated, as opposed to miners being the decisionmakers thru the software they mine with. Is this correct? If so, couldn't a reluctant mining community just ignore UASF nodes and run off a minority (presumably) of non-UASF nodes?
Thanks for any clarifications. I've read a bit in the general media but don't really grasp this approach yet.

Until 8 days ago I held around 75% BTC to 25% altcoins. From then til yesterday in three waves I sold down my BTC to around 20%, with most of the 80% in alts now divided between Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Zcash. 
I plan to sit with them (I'm not a frequent trader) until/unless there is significant news. I will not reenter bitcoin in a big way until I see some light at the end of the tunnel with regards to the transaction bottleneck and the Core/BU civil war. 
(I stupidly forgot about my investment in GBTC (Bitcoin Investment Trust) for my Roth IRA until the markets closed Friday. I plan to get out of that on Monday as well, though I'll lose a couple thousand $ now compared to what I could have gotten Friday.)
Apart from selling GBTC in my Roth IRA I'm not pulling a single satoshi out from cryptocurrency to fiat. There's so much bright promise here in cryptocurrency, apart from the horribly managed Segwit/blocksize thing. I think any of the four alts I mentioned above could take the lead and continue to soar if bitcoin continues to stumble.

Glancing at the block counts, BU has greater miner support than Core. But neither side is anywhere NEAR a majority, much less the supermajority required to win this contest.

1. The ETF disapproval brought a lot of press. Headlines are good for bitcoin as they create awareness that is still greatly lacking in the general population. 
2. Some of those newly aware people may have entered into bitcoin expecting to be able to buy on a dip.
3. Many people are looking to hedge by getting into altcoins. But most alts can only be bought on exchanges using bitcoin. So bitcoin is currently serving as a conduit to the alts. So long as money is flowing through to them, it will prop up BTC.
If my last theory is correct, if the alt market stalls out or starts to do a pullback, BTC price will also suffer. This is the opposite of what one might expect in a simple BTC vs. alts scenario. We shall see.
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:18:09
Right. I think the Bitcoin Unlimited folks imagine that miners are in control (as opposed to their boogeyman of malicious devs). But the miners are not in control so long as there is competition from other blockchains. It is the market that is ultimately in control.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:42:27
One of the big "lessons learned" I'm taking from all this is that governance matters, and needs to be carefully thought through. I was glad when I learned of bitcoin as a currency that was not controlled by a cabal of Armani-suited men sitting round a mahogany table, but this herd-of-cats thing isn't working out so well either.
I still have faith in the free market and how it will ultimately correct things - but that correction involves the killing off of inept cryptocurrencies. Which is a bit rough on those holding them unless they are constantly paying attention and make the appropriate trades. It's the price paid for being on the leading edge of the adoption curve, I guess.

@_date: 2017-03-18 18:42:15
Nice analogy. One thing I'd add is that it looks to me like BU is moving more of the legislative powers to the miners with their implementation (getting to decide blocksize unilaterally in a dynamic manner, and a few other things). Fundamentally that looks like a bad idea to me. Sure isn't the "decentralization" they like to talk about.

The prices on each exchange are based on supply/demand, not fees. Until the latest PBOC actions it was the Chinese that had consistently higher prices for months.

So what happens if BU activates, holds a majority of hashpower, but all the exchanges refuse to list it?
Core struggles on in a miserable state - long block times yield mass congestion, yielding further prices drops. Meanwhile people can't even do anything with BTU coins whether they want to or not. That means miners don't get  paid, and pricing is erratic - can you imagine trying to figure out BTU coin data from a bunch of Localbitcoins transactions?
Eventually core difficulty adjusts and they get some normalcy, but with a seriously tanked price. Meanwhile the miners on the BTU side are in financial stress. They can't pay their bills and while they do cajole a few exchanges (or start new ones), the damage is done. Their coin price is down too, especially since it looks like the worst is over for the Core chain. 
As the core price starts to recover, BTU miners face a tough choice - keep mining a basically unsellable coin, or jump to the chain with a price in recovery and still low hashrate. Sooner or later the defections start. And that spells the beginning of the end for BU....
That's how my thought process works through this. Anyone else want to take a stab?

Hopefully as you mature you'll realize that the only thing worse than corporate greed is the greed of those who would use the power of government to plunder corporations.

This would be momentous (though I have to say I like the idea of going back to GPU mining even if I didn't get involved); it would guarantee the survival of the core coin. If they did it quickly and cleanly enough it might even retain much of the economic majority. I suspect it would depend at that point on just how successful BU was in pulling buyers in to support their fork. They have miners, but it's not clear how much support from investors they will have.

A UASF is a user-activated soft fork. An attempt to force Segwit into reality without needing to reach the 95% threshhold.
A very questionable approach IMHO, but I don't see the miners activating SW on their own any time soon, and this may increase pressure on them to negotiate, which is what I think is really needed at this point. People need to sit down, calm down, and _talk_ to each other about the different perspectives and arguments pro and con the BU/Core debate.

So far they've talked about switching based on miner support, but I've seen nothing about their interest in support from the market. They seem to assume the market will simply buy in to their effort when they act, despite the exchanges warning that replay protection is needed, and that they will be listed as the alt. Am I missing something? Do they have a good way to measure market support for their effort?

The overflow error wasn't infinite (though I suppose it was effectively close to it). More importantly it happened _very_ early in the development of bitcoin, and was contained and had no real-world impact. The resources available for proper development are orders of magnitude greater today, as are the financial risks. The takedown of hundreds of nodes in the bitcoin ecosystem today is a real-world impact and should never have happened.

They are one of the purest examples of socialism around. This is what you get when you engage in class warfare and destroy anyone's incentive to produce anything because you steal it "for the people." 
The pie-in-the-sky fantasy version of socialism in some people's heads is not relevant. What is relevant is what happens in the real world with real human nature at play every time socialism is implemented.
Trying to blame outside forces is just lame. If socialism were so great then socialist countries would be monkeying with free market societies, not the other way around. As it is Venezuela was ignored until recently by the US, etc., long after they had collapsed. Likewise, when I was in Cuba a few months ago the people there understood their problems were the result of socialism and the attendant central planning and lack of freedom.

Which means that we need to look at the "best" way(s) of doing off-chain TX within the spirit of bitcoin, seeking the best possible tradeoff of security, speed and efficiency. Off-chain TX are already a reality through merchant/exchange linkages (such as Purse and Coinbase). And they are going to keep growing rapidly in this high-fee environment, or we'll be seeing a lot of bankruptcies shortly. 
So objecting to segwit/LN, for example, as if the alternative of a pure on-chain ecosystem can be maintained, is already a fantasy. That ship has sailed.

Does this raise the risk of an artificially overbid market for fees if other companies/services are doing the same thing? That is, could this sort of practice lead to a spiral effect as companies look at the average fee today and outbid it, leading to a higher average the next day and so on and on?

Not unchecked. If that were so corporations would never be fined (or dragged through court for years), corporate officers would never be imprisoned and so on. If you get beyond your prejudices you will see that whatever influence they have, it is not controlling (nor are the monolithic). Whereas the solutions offered by people who fear corporations inevitably lead to more total control and centralization by a government that would be far more abusive. 
Compare for example the worst things you can come up with regarding corporate abuses to the genocides, the environmental devastation, the slave society and gulag archipelago's established by the USSR precisely in the name of fighting the scourge of capitalism. And then China followed the same pattern, and Cuba, and Vietnam, and Laos and North Korea and Cambodia. And now we have Venezuela. 
The solution to corporations that act badly is to have good laws that are just and fair and prosecute them when they are broken. Not to demonize all corporations and frighten yourself with extravagant tales of corporate power to justify overthrowing government to "save" people from the supposed dominance of corporations.

I wouldn't recommend making it the bulk of any portfolio. But my GBTC investment is up 400% in two years. If you can afford to lose a slice of your portfolio, crypto seems like a great long-term investment. (Something incorporating a basket of the major alts, either passively or actively managed, would allow exposure while mitigating risk). 
@_date: 2019-03-31 03:22:15
I think there are more alternatives in the crypto space, on many levels (not just LN). $50 TX in the short term would only happen if there was intense demand to use BTC over any and all alternatives. But today's crypto users can easily switch to Stellar or Nano (or Doge) if that kind of TX pressure hit. Not to mention the wider availability of stablecoins on many exchanges.
Basically, the only way I see BTC hitting $50 TX again is if it had extremely heavy usage and that usage was being channeled into a mature LN (and further off-chain systems built on LN). Then on-chain TX would be reserved for major players, for whom the TX fee would be a small price to pay for the security of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:27:06
Over at /btc they are basically promising replay attacks. And they were of the opinion that if they can reach 50% hashrate the remaining miners would swing into line. I'm not sure about this, but I wouldn't discount it either.
I agree they are in trouble from the standpoint of exchanges. The way I see this, this is an effort by miners to control the protocol and monopolize fees, putting them at odds with the average user and investors. As such they are going to crash and burn if they hardfork, because ultimately it's not the miners who control bitcoin, it's the market. And if they refuse to acknowledge that, bitcoin is destroyed in their hubris. 
It's really weird to be fleeing to the safety of alts - that sounds so bizarre - but that's what I'm doing. Because either a continued impasse with current fees or a hardfork are going to be disasters. And I don't see a 3rd option being realistic at this point.

I think you are making a big mistake. Core is doing their best to enable bitcoin to go mainstream and handle dramatically higher adoption rates. They don't deserve the conspiracy theory nonsense. 
BU is rejecting these changes, but stunting bitcoin's growth even if they are successful. The dramatic shift in control to a cabal of miners in their design is, judging from their actions so far, sure to lead to the market rejecting their centralized system of control as we flee to altcoins.
Whether we have a continued impasse or BU's crash-and-burn fork attempt, alts are going to be growing and bitcoin suffering for a good while now. I suggest planning accordingly.

The basic concern here is that central banks can siphon off our buying power and transfer it to themselves or politically connected elites as a subtle but potentially rather extreme tax. In the worst cases this leads to economic collapse, but even if done "well" and with "good motives" it still constitutes a tax and usurpation of our wealth. Whether we can create a better system remains to be seen, but there's no value in denying the problems with the existing order, or blandly claiming that it just has to be this way.

True, that's the pattern. But what is completely unknown is whether this is the top of the surge or just the beginning. You can make a case either way. I have a hard time believing there will be much of a drop before the halving takes place, though. After each jump we've seen support rush in pretty quickly, limiting the pullbacks to a few percent. If Vinny Lingham is right about a short squeeze we are no where near the top.

The award per block is adjusted in the halvening, not the difficulty. The difficulty is calibrated to keep near 10 minute block times. The difficulty will adjust if enough miners drop out, but that's not automatic. It's a reflection of the hashrate, which is tied to how many miners choose to mine. 
I don't think anyone really expects many miners to drop out at the halvening, given how things are going. Even KnC may start having second thoughts...

Keep in mind there are 2 risks: Risk of theft, and risk of losing your private keys due to a computer crash, house fire, or similar event. Most people seem to focus on the first risk, but it can make them more vulnerable to the second. Whatever you do, you should be sure you can recover from a disaster that destroys your primary copy (whether paper wallet, computer/flash drive, or Trezor), by having a 2nd (or 3rd) copy safe somewhere.
Of course, this increases the opportunities for theft, but there are ways to balance the risks. Using a multi-sig approach can allow you to spread copies of your wallet/keys in such a way that a thief getting a single key does not have access, and your losing a single key does not eliminate your own access.
Best wishes with it.

Like the multiple scammers who contacted me after I listed my riding mower for sale on Craigslist. They were very busy moms/people in the middle of a move who didn't have time to come see the mower and just trusted me. They'd send a mover to pick it up, I'd just pay the mover after they mailed me a check including the extra for the mover. Mind you, I'd pay the mover with a Moneygram/Moneypak or some such nonsense (Oddly, they wouldn't buy with bitcoin when I asked. :-)
So I got multiple checks in the mail from oddly named ("Jack and Jill Enterprises") outfits, drop-shipped from 3rd-party locations. And lots of hilarious text messages as I strung them along.

Capitalism only leads to monopolies if capitalism is subverted - that is, if the free markets are corrupted into unfree markets by powerful players who influence or control government to create barriers to the competition that would otherwise arise. And socialism aids exactly that process by centralizing power, making the corruption easier to maintain and increase. That's why socialism always makes the problems it was supposed to solve worse.

I think you are right. At this point BCH price is being supported by traders and speculators. As they become aware that they are hurting their own (typically much greater) investments in bitcoin by propping up the BCH price they should begin pulling support. 
Moreover, the halvening for BCH is being accelerated dramatically if these swings continue. Recall how BCH supporters are boasting about their low fees? Combine that with their empty blocks and there is little fee revenue for miners. With a falling price, halving block rewards at accelerated rates, and little fee revenue, the case for mining BCH will collapse.

There is something really flaky going on with the bitcoin price right now. I've been watching the markets on Coinbase Pro and Binance, versus what Coinmarketcap and Coincodex show. 
The latter two seem disconnected from reality. While the actual markets are around $4080-4090 during my watch, Coincodex is reporting around $4130 or higher. And Coinmarketcap is careening all over the place from $4100 to over 4200, rapidly changing every few minutes. If that were real I'd be seeing it on the exchanges, but they are quiet.
Looking on the market tabs on Coinmarketcap doesn't reconcile the situation. However it is converting stable coins, it isn't doing it properly. I thought was seeing some great arbitrage opportunities (which is why I pulled up Coinbase Pro and Binance), but they simply aren't there when you check the source, despite what Coinmarketcap says.
Edit: Bitstamp and Bitfinex on Bitcoinwisdom show a little more volatility, but are in line with what I'd expect from the other exchanges prices. I suspect something is "broken" in stablecoin conversions being used by CMC, etc.

I endorse the advice to find the best qualified data recovery service and send them the drive/USB. It's worth the cost in your case. Definitely don't have anyone, even "experts" mess with swapping components and so forth. There's a point where that makes sense troubleshooting a failure where an A-B-A swap can pinpoint a problem, but this is not a science experiment and there is too much risk of degrading the information if it is still in recoverable but marginal condition. (I'm a quality engineer at a safety-critical automotive electronics plant). The experts will know what best to do (including how to best handle and pack it - minimize handling at this point until you have that direction!)

But do you understand why the fees are elevated? The bad actors held up Segwit for a long time, which then delays the LN to some degree as well, preventing scaling.

How many people are blaming bitcoin and its supporters now instead of blaming those who have been attacking it?

Given the way the price dumped when that one block did get found one would think the miners and backers of BCH would be the ones nervous about each new block being mined. Dump...dump...dump as each new round of BCH arrives in the exchanges.

One reason might be to enable atomic swaps with bitcoin. If that proves to be a valuable feature for alts then SW could become well-nigh universal.

That would be good news. As far as I can tell most altcoins are held on exchanges; a viable method of securing a wide array of altcoins on a single secure device will be good news for people who want to hold their own coins without the headaches of maintaining a large number of wallets. 
Moreover, moving coins off exchanges will slow down the velocity of the affected cryptocurrencies since holders will be less able to sell on a whim (or in a short-lived panic), raising prices.

Sounds like you might have a lot of small inputs. If you received a lot of small payments in the past it will make it more expensive to spend the bitcoin since it has to reference more inputs, driving up the TX size. Try waiting for the weekend when TX activity drops off.

That represents more than a 40% reduction in TX capacity for the Bitcoin network. It's not "critical" but it is a major pain for fee-sensitive or low-value transacters.

There are tools to provide anonymity in bitcoin with more on the way, but I do not believe it is a goal of anyone to make anonymity standard for bitcoin.
The crypto universe is big enough for many coins filling many niches. Full anonymity likely will always require tradeoffs that may well impair bitcoin's core feature as a store of value, or possible future goals like being a convenient cash replacement.

No one deciding whether they want to sign up for a Paypal account vs. a Coinbase account for their personal needs thinks in these terms. They look at how much it costs out of pocket.
In the future bitcoin will be secured with fees, but even at current levels of use fees will be plenty robust for the necessary security. (and I'm talking pennies in fees like we have today - not some fictitious $14.) New block rewards will peter out until deflation takes hold. By contrast inflation will keep eating away at any savings held in cash. It's not hard to figure out that securities markets will switch over to buying and selling based in crypto rather than fiat (for speed, record-keeping and transactional advantages among other things). So I don't see how it helps to compare Paypal to Bitcoin even from this other perspective.

With the SD-IRA I have, I pay $200/year to a custodian. I paid about $1500 up front (or maybe a little more to take care of all the misc. state filings and so on) to establish the LLC. Broad took care of all the heavy lifting so it was pretty straightforward. Once the limited liability company was created in my name and I established a checking account, the custodian sent all the IRA funds I committed to it. At that point I effectively was running an investment company with myself as customer, and can do whatever I want (within legal boundaries of course) with my IRA funds, which gives tremendous freedom. So besides the setup fee and the $200/year custodial fee it's just a matter of paying whatever fees you would to normally invest money with various institutions or exchanges.

This will give you some insight if you don't understand what is going on: 
If your TX fee was $12 it sounds like you have a lot of dust in your wallet from using faucets or other microtransactions in the past. Wait for a quiet period (or after LN launch) and send the full amount in your wallet to a new address in your wallet to consolidate all the inputs. It will cost a bit, but future TX will be much lower since they will refer back to the single consolidated TX rather than a bunch of small inputs.

You should have said "off blockchain" not off of Bitcoin. If someone hands a USB with a wallet file to someone who trusts them, to pay for a car, the transaction is still a Bitcoin transaction. It's just being done off blockchain.
Off-blockchain TX happen all the time within exchanges and between merchants that have agreements with exchanges to save on TX fees. Their volume probably already dwarfs that of on-chain TX.

And I'd rather find out that such a pretender is not ready for prime time right out of the gate, then to have it coddled for three weeks and have us start investing money in it, and then someone inevitably hacks it and takes it down. That doesn't do anyone any favors.

Most of what you mention are not "kill switches" but just attacks with temporary effects. Such attacks would be quickly countered by devs, miners and users. 
As to virii stealing wallets and so forth, there has already been intense effort by hackers to do just that for years now, ever since bitcoin became valuable. Even if they have the best tools I expect the impact would be limited (and things like cold storage would mitigate the impact). Again, users would quickly react to eliminate most vulnerabilities once news of the attack spread.
Finally, there are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies based on an array of different technologies. It would be extremely difficult to attack more than a sliver of them at once, which means value would flow to the more robust or resistant cryptos, reducing the impact of any such attack. There would be temporary harm, but also valuable lessons learned by proponents of cryptocurrency. After the dust settled crypto could resume its upwards march.

1. Yes
2. Some reasons: 
3. A lot will no doubt change between now and November. If it is clear the market rejects B2X (we really need a fairly presented futures market on this) miners will not kamikaze themselves mining at a loss.
4. The risk without replay protection is that you send coins on one fork when you intended to only send their counterparts on the other fork. Since the private and public keys are all shared up to the point of the split there's no way without taking additional measures to prevent either chain from recognizing a transaction using such keys.

That doesn't seem to bother them. There was an article this morning on Coindesk ( boasting of grand plans for BCH. But when you read it, there was nothing there except (1) a willingness to fork over and over to increase blocksize as needed, and (2) interest in changing the POW algorithm. 
Literally nothing else.
They want to keep the TX fee near zero, but don't have a plan for how to cope with inevitable spam attacks that would accompany that. No mention of anything for increasing merchant acceptance or anything else. (So much for buying that coffee.) I'd say stick a fork in it, BCH is done if this article is any indication.
(Edit: OK, there is this bit about their roadmap: " including changing how transactions are ordered and block data is computed" to improve scaling. Kinda like Segwit but without 90% of the benefits?)

You get the same block reward (12.5 coins). 
In the short term it comes down to comparing the relative hashrates of BTC and BCH to the relative prices of each. If BCH has 10% of the price of BTC, and only 5% of the hashrate, then a miner would see an opportunity to profit by switching to BCH. But only if they think the price will hold up long enough for them to sell. And that is probably an issue for any miner at this point.

One thing you can do is wait for a slow period (weekends) or after Segwit activates and there are no spam attacks clogging the mempool, and then empty your wallet to a new address. I had one clogged with dust and for a while it looked like it was going to take over $100 in fees to clean things up. But in the quiet period on the edge of August 1 I was able to clear it out for just a couple dollars. So it can be done with a little patience.

There are rumors the North Koreans are mining, but I'm skeptical. I doubt any other governments are running mining operations. Governments are not exactly known for competing efficiently against private enterprise when it comes to operations like this. 
Not to mention their bureaucracy. If the idea even occurred to someone within government it's probably still mired in a series of subcommittee meetings to explore the viability of the effort, with findings being perrennially out of date by the time they are released.

You don't mine bitcoin with a computer, not for quite a few years now. Look into altcoin mining like Zcash or Dash or Ethereum for GPU/CPU mining.

Just hodl, we are going to the moon! 
(OK, here's my short version: 2 year civil war over best way to scale bitcoin. Ver/Wu/Wright cartel blocks Segwit to keep using patent-infringing covert ASICboost for massive profits. Core dev discovers Wu built Antbleed malware into miners to shut down competition if needed. Bitcoin users pissed, take matters into their own hands with UASF to force Segwit on miners. Miners get w. businesses and agree to Segwit (bundled with 2 MB hardfork later) to save face. 
Segwit is activated by the miners just ahead of the community UASF on August 1. Splinter faction of miners decides to reject Segwit (to keep covert ASICBoost?) and create a fork with 8 MB blocks instead, launching it August 1 instead of the UASF and with mere days of warning. Minor chaos and confusion ensues. Traders and hodlers scramble to figure out how to stay safe or profit from fork. And that pretty much brings you up to the present. More to come in the incredible dramatic saga of Bitcoin!

The difficulty just jerked upwards again on BCH, so miners are flocking back to Bitcoin. Plus it's the weekend. That combination will lead to a surge of blocks and reduction in the mempool, reducing the needed fees for the next day or two. But if you miss that window you'll likely see them rise again.

This; once difficulty adjusts on BCH a large proportion of miners are going to rush back over. BCH blocks will then drag out worse than BTC has been suffering lately.
Once thing I haven't seen people explore is the little "emergency" adjustment mechanism BCH has if their blockrate falls too low. Basically it ratchets the difficulty down in between regular difficulty adjustments to make it easier to mine.
I know we all figured miners would find some kind of equilibrium between BCH and BTC, but I think BCH did this to game the system:
1. Entice miners to mine BCH with a well timed pump.
2. Miners go back to BTC once difficulty adjusts.
3. BCH languishes, then difficulty drops on it.
4. Miners rush back to BCH to take advantage of the depressed difficulty again.
Repeat every 2016 blocks.
Why do this? Well, it brings a lot more hashpower on board, and some might stick with BCH as time goes on. It's hard as a miner to turn up your nose at BCH if you keep finding yourself mining it. Basically they are pulling the block rewards forward with accelerated mining to reward miners now at the expense of lower payouts for mining later. 
None of this means regular users should buy into BCH. On the contrary it shows how the system is being manipulated for enhanced mining profitability. That's a scamcoin warning sign to beware of.

Probably not to be honest. HitBTC has been accepting deposits for 36+ hours and has been lower than the rest, but is rising now (.112 BTC). Bittrex has dropped a bit but is at .1575 as I type. And Bittrex volumes were much higher despite HitBTC accepting deposits; if people were so eager to dump that would not be true.
Since HitBTC has been accepting deposits I think we have to accept there will be no huge dump, just an evening out of the arbitrage opportunities between the disparate prices. That's already happening. 
Of course someone can say they didn't want to dump on HitBTC because the price was so low, so they waited until Bittrex etc. were available. But surely most people know they can't count on being first in line - as soon as the door was opened at Bittrex the price dumped _internally_ without anyone depositing. If you didn't dump on HitBTC the implication is that you think the price will settle above HitBTC's levels if you wait. 
I tend to expect massive dumps from airdrops and they tend not to materialize. So I'm coming around to the realization that my expectations are wrong, and BCH will probably stabilize in the short term around .15. At least until the software blows up or something.

You're mostly right, but there is some evidence of a gradual reduction in volatility in bitcoin price as it has matured. I suspect the next downturn will be less severe than the 2014 decline now that institutional investors are getting involved. There are too many people and organizations looking to take advantage of any dips, having seen how things have gone in the past. This should be true even if there is a major Gox-level event.

You have it backwards. The Core devs are enabling instant transactions with the Segwit/Lightning Network upgrade and other offchain TX work that is being done. The big block cartel that has been fighting them tooth and nail has nothing to offer in the way of instant transactions because they want to keep all TX on-chain, and thus subject to 10 minute block times, congested throughput and mining monopolization.

Larger blocks without any need for them just creates opportunity for spam attacks having a worse impact on blockchain bloat and latency. And they don't have any need for them.

Coinmarketcap has designated it as BCH, which is as close to official as you can get in my book. 
This is not the first "Bitcoin ____" coin though, and I'm not sure it's reasonable for people besides the developers of a coin to name it. The other pretenders are unknown or forgotten, I expect this one will fade as well. After the hooplah the reality that it is second-rate will set in. 
Never mind competing with Bitcoin, for example - put it in a head to head contest with Litecoin - who wins? Litecoin has Segwit, its scaling and its fixes, and will be able to do atomic swaps with other crypto. It has only half the max rate of blockchain bloat and less of a latency problem than BCH if the latter ever gets popular. And with lower market cap there will inherently be lower security/hashrate, yet the hashrate to attack it will always be available so long as it shares PoW with BTC. For these reasons alone I doubt it will keep ahead of LTC, as investors and businesses will find it hard to justify using it over the competition.

Nice bit of history, but I don't think the logic holds up regarding halvenings and price. The price does not magically adjust to keep miners profitable.

Nobody is buying or selling bitcoin because they are motivated to keep miners operating at a profit as a kind of status quo.

I'm not sure the exact date, but the battle to defeat the 2MB hardfork of SW2X should be the next major fireworks date.
The way I see it, if BCH tanks it is evidence the market is disinterested in big blocks; with SW providing some scaling and much more coming offchain there would be no need for the hardfork. 
Conversely, if BCH does well, let it be the big block coin. With mining centralization already an issue why should BTC do anything to aggravate that problem? Let each coin follow a separate path rather than taking both down the same path.

I don't think the halvening has that much raw power, but it's an objective change that tightens the supply of new bitcoins entering the market. That makes people focus on it, which amplifies it's actual impact as people make the idea of a bitcoin bull market related to the halvening a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It really does look to me like we are still tracking about the same point in the cycle as 4 years ago, as if we were on a halvening-related market cycle. I started in Jan. 2014 and was investing in 2015 after a brutal first year (fortunately I spent 2014 mining, not investing cash, which softened the impact). That turned out to be very good timing.

SW doesn't magically fix fees instantaneously. It provides the groundwork for it, but it will take time for the full impact to be reached as wallets and exchanges upgrade and people make the necessary precursor TX to begin doing SW TX. 
Fees are high again because (1) BTC is popular and hot right now and (2) BCH is oscillating wildly in profitability, causing bitcoin miners to abandon BTC _en masse_ every few days to mine BCH. In these periods blocks slow down on BTC and congestion builds in the TX mempool, while empty BCH blocks pour forth at 30-50/hour. (We have a customer service problem with our miners, though I can't blame them.)
Once BCH dies back, SW adoption increases, and best of all LN TX become available, we should see fees drop off to a modest level.
Edit: Oh yes, there is also the problem of the anti-Segwit miners at Antpool mining empty and half-empty BTC blocks despite the mempool, either out of spite or a strategy to try to degrade bitcoin and railroad people to their BCH scamcoin. (The miners need buyers to prop up the BCH price while they mine it at dramatically accelerated rates to milk it while they can.)

There is a caveat to this; with a credit card on file you can make instant buys on Coinbase, versus waiting a week for your bank funds to clear and be deposited to Coinbase so you can transfer them to GDAX. So if you are confident the price is rising it may be reasonable to do the instant buy.

The fees are based on the size of your transaction (in bytes), not the amount of money. It tends to be lower over weekends, and the mempool has been getting spammed recently in order to drive up fees (not sure how bad it is at the moment). 
Segwit is slowly growing, which will increase effective TX capacity. Virtually all wallet estimators do tend to overestimate, and it sounds like Jaxx is part of that pattern. You can use this site to figure out a better fee:

Easy to make an assertion. Harder to defend it. Please explain how Bitcoin Cash is not more centralized than the Core development community. For example, review the list of Core members and their diversity, their open debates and discussions, compared to the secretive cabal that created and pushed Bitcoin Cash.

Right. A shock event can be the trigger, but  the trigger can also be any random whale who decides he wants to be first in line for the exit after a strong rise and dumps his coins; others quickly follow and it turns into a cascade as the herd figures the fun is over for the time being and everyone expects it to keep heading lower so no one cares to buy just yet.

Small quibble: Bitcoin's blockchain is a useful tool for documenting something of a digital nature as being in existence and under the control of a given private key holder, in a way that is more secure than pretty much anything else on earth. That gives Bitcoin a significant intrinsic value. By taking a hash of the digital information in question and including it with a transaction you prove the information exists and that you hold it at a particular time. That sort of capability is worth a lot in some quarters.

Just transfer your funds (free and instant) to GDAX from Coinbase and place a limit order - it is literally free.
Or you could get your bitcoins via Purse.io for a 14-15% fee, or localbitcoins for a lesser markup (but still far worse than coinbase); most bitcoin ATM's likewise take a couple % off the top. Exchanges like Coinbase that offer credit card or bank account links are about as efficient as you will find. Just don't forget to use GDAX to make the actual purchase.

Off chain transactions can be accomplished more cheaply than on-chain transactiions. It's just an issue of trust and doing your own accounting.
We talk about solutions like the Lightning Network as an example of off-chain TX, but there are a lot of off-chain TX happening today between merchants and exchanges, such as Coinbase and Purse.io. Saves both sides money and time, since they also don't have to wait for confirmations.

You can google Bitcoin faucets and get tiny amounts for free. But why aim for a small amount? Bitcoin transfer fees are the same whether transferring $1 or $100,000,000 worth of bitcoin, so you won't be able to do anything efficiently with a tiny amount unless/until you have access to offchain transactions. (Like sending BTC from Coinbase to Purse.io, or with the lightning network).

The claim was that they are using covert ASICBoost themselves while denying it to anyone besides themselves. So you shouldn't see any difference. Just having an Antminer isn't enough - it has to be activated.
Now, conveniently, they've launched BitcoinCash right as Segwit is getting activated. And BitcoinCash has eliminated Segwit. So you can imagine why some of us are _awfully suspicious_ that BitcoinCash is just an excuse for them to keep privately profiting off ASICBoost at the expense of competition.

Sure, if the password is strong enough. I'd emphasize these elements:
1. The file should be stored in secure location(s), whether on the cloud or on physical devices (HD, flash drive, SD card etc.) At least one location should be outside your physical home at sufficient distance that a natural disaster could not destroy all copies at once. (i.e., Cloud storage is good for this)
2. The file should be obscured by naming it to be meaningful to you (or your beneficiaries), but not to any random hacker or thief. For example, "Kids Christmas list 2013" instead of "Bitcoin seed file for my life savings".
3. The file should have a robust password that cannot be easily hacked. If relying on memory I strongly suggest either a trusted 2nd person have the password. Or have it written in a secure location separate from the seed file and not containing the location/identity of the seed file.

It sounds like you are not familiar with the creation/evolution debate. If you define evolution simply as "biological change" then of course it is a fact that is self-evident to anyone who has compared themselves to their own children. But that is not what his link was about. 
It's a cheap bait-and-switch trick to first define evolution as "change" and then insist, as evolutionists too often do, that any evidence of change therefore proves that all life evolved by natural processes in the absence of an intelligent agent. 
This is why evolutionists get so panic-stricken at the thought of a public debate. When the public learns that the real difference between the creation models and evolutionism is the net direction of biological change, and how all that "mountain of evidence" contradicts the evolutionary position and supports the creation model of neutral or degenerative changes - the debate is over.
Whether we are talking about antibiotic and toxin resistance as a fluke side effect of degenerative mutations, seedless fruit, flight or sight loss in birds or troglodytes, metabolism of nylon due to damaged regulatory processes in bacteria or the host of other beneficial or neutral mutations observed in science - to say nothing of all the harmful mutations observed - the evidence for degeneration is overwhelming. There is no magical process that is mystically doing complex integrative work creating new functions and specified processes within the hypertechnological world of cellular biology, outside of intelligent agents.
There are thousands of biologists like Dr. John Sanford (the Cornell geneticist I mentioned) who reject evolution. For example Dr. Bob Carter, Dr. Jerry Bergman, Dr. Jeff Tompkins, Dr. Todd Wood, Dr. Georgia Purdom, Dr. Leonard Brand. Or we could talk about paleontologists like Dr. Kurt Wise, Dr. Marcus Ross or Dr. Joachim Scheven. Or geologists like Dr. Steve Austin, Dr. Andrew Snelling or Dr. John Reed. Each of these men and women have perfectly normal academic credentials from universities like Harvard. 
If you can't even cope with obvious facts that are staring you in the face about the present - such as the existence of thousands of scientists who reject evolutionism - why should anyone pay attention to your religious beliefs about the distant past? If you don't understand what creationists actually believe you owe it to yourself and others to understand better before attempting any criticism.

And anyone can create LN channels. So any tendency towards centralization can only be maintained insofar as the major hubs provide the best ratio of service to cost. If they overcharge or provide poor service anyone will be able to step in and compete with them, restoring cost-efficient and effective service to users. That's the beauty of a competitive free market.

OK, so at 15% fee, and a current price of $4356.... that would be about .006 BTC.

Since anyone can run a LN channel it's not centralizing in itself. We have a much bigger and actual problem with centralization of current TX processing (miners) compared to the _possible_ problem of LN channel centralization.
And unlike miners, the solution to LN channel centralization is simple in principle: Just choose not to use dominant channels, seeking out new or smaller channels where possible. That's a power users don't have with mining TX.

It's the usual pattern of pumping and dumping a new coin by traders. Now that the fun is over it's all downhill from here. Too bad for the folks who had their funds in a wallet. I wonder if the miners behind BCH planned it this way: 
1. Put all their BTC on exchanges that would support BCH. 
2. Pull from mining it to ensure nothing can move.
3. Sell their BCH on the pump, knowing the vast majority of BCH out there is sitting on the sidelines creating artificial scarcity on the exchanges.
4. Stick with mining BTC because they know perfectly well BCH will tank from here once people figure out they got played.
Awesome scam if that's how this plays out. No obvious criminal activity like promoting malware wallet splitting tools.

Personally I'm allocating 100% of my non-retirement crypto investments to charity. I just made my first withdrawal this spring of $1000 more than the total I invested into crypto for the first round of charity. (Don't worry, there's plenty left over).
So, for example,  I'm funding 100% of the salary of a pastor to serve in a gang-infested village in El Salvador, along with funds for feeding and caring for children as part of the effort. And I'm giving special gifts to five missionary families (large enough that the first ones to receive it called us to say there must have been a mistake in our donation). And there's more left over for supporting Bible smuggling and aid to persecuted Christians and families of martyrs.

You should be very concerned about an unethical organization trying to switch you to an altcoin without bothering to tell you - actually, being very dishonest in how they presented it in their initial post on it.

The BitcoinCash.org site gave no word on their preference, so it was left to the market to decide. BitConnectCoin has a prior claim on BCC and in my limited observation with exchanges that tends to carry the day, and they do not allow conflicts for obvious reasons.
Since multiple exchanges and now CoinMarketCap have settled on BCH and it does not have the conflict that BCC has, it is a safe bet it will be BCH going forward.

A couple people have been raising this point today: How can we penalize miners who are censoring transactions, whether because they are anti-SW or to force congestion on the fee market? It's perfectly reasonable for a miner to sort through available TX in the mempool by fee/byte, but I don't think there is any other valid reason for leaving non-zero fee TX in the mempool.
We need to allow for situations where a block is mined within seconds of the prior block, but otherwise blocks should always be full if the mempool is backlogged. To do otherwise is for the miners to be failing in their _raison d'etre_ for the Bitcoin ecosystem.
The off-the-cuff solutions offered were swatted down by a Core dev, but I do think this is something the devs need to start brainstorming (sorry to load another item on their plate...) The problem of malicious miners is just not going to magically disappear without mechanisms to enforce good behavior.

Not a bad idea. Actually this could also be handled by a 3rd party service using API... I think. (The API would need to be able to see Last Login time, not sure they do that.)

True for 2013, not sure about other years. The percent increase each week is irregular - for example, the first week increase is 8.13%, the last one 7.25%, whereas one in the middle is at 12.63%. So I'm also curious how these numbers are derived.
I know when I looked at it this spring the average daily increase was around roughly .2% over the prior year. This chart is dramatically more aggressive. That may match the last couple months, but is too aggressive as compared to the longer term in my opinion. 
Then again, with news of hedge funds rushing into BTC, I wouldn't bet against it.

I expect it will be orders of magnitude more efficient, and since almost anyone can open a channel (unless government regulators screw that up), competition should keep fees very low.
A lot of the cost of credit cards is based on (1) near monopoly status, (2) administrative costs relating to handling chargebacks, disputes, etc., and (3) paying for rebate/points/rewards to cardholders. None of that will apply to cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:08:47
I suspect that in the long run miners will enjoy higher earnings if they encourage mass adoption by supporting and enabling off-chain TX like the LN. That will cause the price of BTC to rise, and overall increases in TX both on and off-chain. But I can see how some miners would see any kind of off-chain TX capability as unwanted competition.

Blockstream earned nothing from the high fees. It is the miners who pocketed those extra millions, and who coincidentaly held up scaling. Why don't you follow the money to find who to blame? It's not as if there's a lack of damning evidence in that direction.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:32:09
We don't. We just wanted Segwit.
It was the miners and businesses that make money off bitcoin users that pushed the compromise as a way to save face and still push big blocks. The only "good" thing about big blocks is that it increases the number of TX that miners can earn fees from (instead of losing the TX to off-chain channels). 
You'll see when the time comes that the community will rally again and crush the big block intrusion. After all, if anyone wants big blocks now that's what Bitcoin Cash is for - there's no need for it now on Bitcoin. Why should they get control of both chains?

Predictable. Anyone work out how long until BCH difficulty ratchets down and is more profitable again, causing the next leg of the cycle?
Used to be you just timed your TX for the weekend when you wanted low fees. Now we have to monitor where BCH is in their screwy difficulty cycle as well. It's like Ptolemiac epicycles come to cryptocurrency.

If you pay an inadequate fee your TX will wait behind everyone paying more until the mempool shrinks enough for your TX to be included in a block. This was a problem for a few months until a few weeks ago while the network was being spammed. You shouldn't be having a problem now. If it is taking long now it's probably just random variance with the mining of blocks.

I see. So it occurs to me that most merchants will offer LN channels with customers, or at least their regular ones. This will reduce fees for the paying customer, and will likely result in increased business for the merchant since the customer will tend to shop where they have an established LN channel. Win-win.

I agree with you that Bitcoin needs to be resilient. But it will not win by magic. It wins through persuasion and people making fact-based decisions.

A few years ago they had some serious bugs that let hackers steal funds from many accounts (fortunately white hat hackers got most of the funds, but it was still a big fiasco). I haven't heard of any recent issues. Still, it's generally wiser to not place your BTC online where it is inherently more vulnerable to theft. I've used it a time or two and do appreciate that it now lets you customize fees.

To mount an attack someone would have to design and build a tremendous amount of bitcoin mining equipment. You can't buy such a significant amount on the open market, it would be noticed (not to mention the manufacturers simply don't have the short term capacity - and anyone trying to buy them out for months of production would cause the price of their products to spike wildly.)
So  the government would likely have to do the design and manufacturing themselves, spending hundreds of millions of dollars or more to do so. Probably billions by now or in the very near future (especially if a government is involved - not that efficient.)
Once all this money is spent they then need to launch the attack immediately. Why? Because every day they wait the network hashrate is growing, and their equipment becomes more and more obsolete. So it would make no sense for an attacker to build a vast array of mining equipment and then let it gather dust just in case they wanted to use it someday. If they waited even 12 months, hashpower that would have been sufficient a year earlier would be completely outclassed.
So it's expensive to prepare such an attack, and then pointless if they don't carry out the attack at the first opportunity. And when all that is done, the attack would fail anyway because the devs could simply coordinate a rollback to the point of attack (if the damage were severe enough to warrant it), and a PoW change (bricking all their massive investment).

You guys lost on segwit after months of lies about how people didn't support segwit.

Reddcoin and Dogecoin are the only two I've even heard of. Can you write out, to your own satisfaction, a brief statement of why each coin will succeed in the future? If you can't, you shouldn't be holding them. Most coins with low market caps are basically worthless and will die out, unless they are in the early stages of producing some novel financial improvement.

You really haven't given enough detail for a thorough response. But here's my brief take on it (note I am a fellow GBTC IRA holder, with a wife who doesn't pretend to understand crypto).
1. BTC is volatile. If you are close to retirement, you should be shifting to a more conservative stance. You mention 10% of your IRA is GBTC; depending on the other 90%, you might want to trim your exposure.
2. On the flip side, if you have a lot of time before retirement, the upside potential of GBTC is great. What I'd do is talk it over with your wife and agree on a strategy if the price of BTC does keep rising strongly. For example, if it became 50% of your IRA you might want to consider diversifying. That would be prudent (though I know I'd want to hold on for more at that point).
3. Likewise, talk with her about what you think would be best if BTC goes negative again. It's possible that other cryptos could overtake it, especially if the TX bottleneck remains an issue and the lightning network idea doesn't pan out or is delayed. Having a conversation and agreement about it now could prevent conflict later.
Best advice I can give is: Talk it out with her. Listen fully to her concerns. You are still making the final decision, but she'll be much happier knowing that you take her seriously and fully understand and appreciate her viewpoint. And forcing yourself to defend your choices is a good idea too, because if you can't, then maybe you should be taking another route anyway.

Except that Craig actually found support among other big blockers as shown in that thread. Whereas Luke-jr advocated for a temporary reduction to 300 kb., not 10 kb., long before the current surge, followed by steady increases in blocksize. 
If you read the link you posted, his 10 kb comment was not a suggestion to reduce the max blocksize to 10 kb. He was saying that if LN were implemented at that point it could offload all but 10 kb./block worth of TX. That's a statement about the efficacy of the LN, not a call to reduce the limit to 10 kb!

Lots of coins have low fees because no one uses them. That's the situation BCH is in. If your only marketing point is low fees you are going to wind up losing out to dogecoin (and hundreds of others).
BCH is becoming a pretty obvious scamcoin. The dramatically accelerated mining rewards are enabling miners to generate new BCH at a high rate, while most BCH is still locked up in places like Coinbase and Poloniex. So the miners make great profit (in BTC) selling their BCH to supporters like you. For a little while.
In a few months most of the BCH will be unlocked and have been dumped, and mining rewards will drop as the halvening occurs. The cheap fees you boast of, combined with halved mining rewards, will make BCH not worth mining. At that point it will be extremely vulnerable to 51% attacks. And the damage it is doing to Bitcoin mean there will be a real incentive to launch such attacks to finish BCH off.
So you might want to think things through a bit more carefully.
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:42:24
So have you thought through what happens when spammers hit the mempool with large numbers of TX? 
For all the grief we give miners, keep in mind that to maintain bitcoin security it is actually a good thing in the future (after more halvenings) to have a moderate amount of fee pressure. This ensures miners are compensated enough so there will be enough of them to ward off 51% attacks.
I doubt the HF will happen anyway, given the trajectory things are on.

Exactly our point - the NYA wasn't a Core effort. It was an attempt to undermine Core and establish centralized leadership by the miners and businesses. Same as Bitcoin Cash.

This is speculation, but here's my thoughts:
1. They drove away a LOT of people with their Terms of Service change a few weeks ago. Volumes seem to have dropped, maybe on the order of 75% if my vague recollections from beforehand are accurate.
2. They missed the boat completely with Bitcoin Cash, causing a horde of active traders to shift funds out to other exchanges. Coming at the same time as the ToS change made it especially bad.
3. The news cycle has focused on Segwit activation for BTC, at the expense of altcoin news (besides BCH). So there is little interest or speculation in the alts compared to more normal timeframes.
Personally I'm quite ticked off about it. I launched some big margin trades on Polo, only to watch much of the altcoin market get hammered since Polo handled most of the trading for many alts. In contrast to this spring when every $1 gain in BTC seemingly caused a $3 gain in every alt, this time around most of the alts have been left far behind. So now I get margin calls warnings every hour and am just hanging on hoping that at some point Bitcoin holders will notice the depressed alt market and rebalance their portfolios or realize this is a good time to stock back up on alts.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:31:43
Nope. Value is not automatically carried over to a cloned blockchain. It has to be assigned by the market by selling other coins/assets of value.

For buying Coinbase is about as good as anything (Maybe Gemini matches them). It's just not a good idea to let them hold your funds beyond the purchase since they can be hacked, or hassle you in more ways than you think and even lock your account.
As far as a digital wallet goes, I assume you mean an offline wallet like Electrum? That would be my suggestion for anyone not wanting to run a full Core client or mess with a paper wallet or pay for a hardware wallet.

I usually agree with Nick and hold him in very high esteem, but I disagree with him on this one for the reasons tcrypt mentions. It's very post-modernist to suggest that authors/creators can be ignored and reinterpreted as the reader sees fit; in this context you could have 20 different groups babbling about their own name for this (or any other) coin, and that just causes a breakdown of communications. It's childish.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:39:43
Just out of curiousity, how many books by creationists have you read? I've read in the neighborhood of 500; on the evolutionary side even higher. I presume your conclusion is based on evidence?
There are many people who believe in evolution who have nonetheless done a lot of good observational science. The promoters of evolution, however, like Dawkins, Gould, Eldredge, Bill Nye, Jerry Coyne, Tyson, and so forth are not really among them. Individual creationists like Drs. Sanford (who invented major genetic engineering techniques), Raymond Damadian (who developed the MRI) or even the pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson have all made more significant contributions to science than the whole lot of them combined. You can thank past anti-evolutionists for everything from pasteurization (Pasteur) to antiseptics (Lister) to rocket technology (von Braun) to penicillin (Sir Ernst Chain). I could multiply these examples a hundredfold. None of these men denied the scientific evidence; we simply see no reason to imagine that natural processes (alone) are competent to create biological systems as they exist today and strong evidence against it. 
But again, you actually need to read both sides and honestly understand them to come to an informed conclusion. When I read anti-creationist works (or attended anti-creationist lectures by men like the late Dr. S.J. Gould) it became painfully evident that they failed to do so in even a cursory manner. So the blind lead the blind.

Because they are dominated by miners. As near as I can tell they feel they will lose transaction fees if a large portion of overall transactions occur on off-chain channels, since miners only earn fees from transactions on the blockchain itself. That, and covert ASICboost use by Bitmain, are the main reasons I can think of.

Blockchains could be part of the answer, but as you point out they are not a fix by themselves. They just force potential vote manipulators to dig deeper to manipulate the underlying system. 
It's a GIGO (garbage in/garbage out) problem. Well, no, in principle it's just a GI problem, as the output in principle could be transparent and verifiable. A good blockchain based voting system could ensure the integrity of what goes on within the system and the output from it, but would still be vulnerable to bad inputs (such as creating fake voter identities).

Bitcoin is under attack now, and one of the effects is high fees. The fees are spiking due to a combination of mempool TX spamming and miners jumping back and forth to BCH due to their screwy difficulty adjustments. 
I know many people are willing to concede that the BCH situation is due to stupidity and not malice, but it fits very well within the overall attack pattern:

As currently planned the 2X hardfork will not include replay protection, which means a majority of major exchanges have said they will not list it. I doubt many people will feel comfortable with a coin that the entire Core team has resoundingly rejected and is not listed on most major exchanges, with the disruption of a hardfork thrown in. 
Obviously a lot will be changing in the next few months compared to how things look today. Like Lakompi said, though, it's hard to see how the 2X HF coin can prevail on the timing they have planned.
It does no good for 2X backers to talk about how much support they have. The support is concentrated in specific factions - miners and businesses. Imagine if a group of food companies found it in their interest to make their products 20% sawdust. Would trumpeting how widespread the support for this is among food companies matter to the public buying their product? Of course not. The only thing that ultimately matters is the market of bitcoin buyers.

Yes it fluctuates. But there is a limit, in stark contrast to fiat currencies (including crypto). Fiat currencies can infinitely inflate or deflate, and we definitely have examples of the former. By contrast gold will bobble around a little compared to the cost of a loaf or bread or other good. But you'll never see gold become worth 100,000 loaves of bread, or even 10,000 loaves. Any deviation from the long-term average value of gold (as measured against other basic goods) is a bubble and it will tend to return to the mean. People who think otherwise are kidding themselves (unfortunately some waste a lifetime doing this.)

It's a great store of value in the sense that it won't lose value, but it also has no upside potential. 20 or 30 or 50 years from now an ounce of gold will buy pretty much the same number of loaves or bread or men's suits as today. Bitcoin will vary more in one month than gold will over decades - presumably in a good way if the past 8 years is any indication.

Yup, don't lose your record (and login ID/PW) of your account and the bitcoin on it. Someday you'll be able to retrieve it.  Just a couple days ago I went looking for a little sliver of Dash I left on a mining pool. I didn't even remember which pool, but after trying a few defunct ones I got an old darkcoin pool that redirected to a current site, and found I had 5X as much as I thought. It's like finding $50 in my couch cushions.

Even if that were true - and it's not - there's bound to be a lot of people moving their BTC back to "normal" dispositions after putting them in temporary locations for the split.
The fee distribution looks a little higher than yesterday when it was completely dead during the exchange lockdowns, but it's not nearly as bad as the recent past.

Regarding mining, don't waste any money on "cloud mining" scams. No one is going to take your money and let you mine with their equipment unless you are paying them more than they could just earn themselves with the mining equipment.
If you mean buying your own mining hardware, be aware you need to have extremely cheap access to electricity. Cold outdoor temps help too, because you can use the heat produced to warm your home/office while venting the cold air to keep your miner cool. Mining is a fairly technical affair and I've been out of it three years now, so I'll leave it to others to give more specific advice on getting started. It is a great way to get in up to your neck on learning all the ins and outs of cryptocurrency, but requires a pretty heavy investment in time as well as money.
If you're not into all that, just buy your coins on exchanges and hold them on offline wallets.

@_date: 2017-08-24 15:35:52
This is a  very good article, albeit written from the point of view of a goldbug. I'm taking my time digesting it. 
One point he makes that I think we need to wrestle with is that cryptocurrencies fail as "money" because they lack objective value. Part of this is due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies relative to everything else. 
But I suspect this is also because each of us individually tend to have only one kind of money that we value in a foundational way. Everything else we measure relative to it. If someone offers to sell me a lawnmower for .0483 BTC, and I mentally take that number and start converting it to dollars to see if its a good price or not, then I'm not really using bitcoin as money. I'm bartering with it. Only when I "think in BTC" will I really be using it as money. 
That's very hard, maybe impossible, to do so long as it is volatile. But even if bitcoin were not volatile, so long as people were doing this calculation in their head it would not truly be money for them. I do not think government fiat and cryptocurrency will be able to co-exist with both as forms of money. One will ultimately prevail over the other. This perhaps will be bitcoins' last and greatest battle, if it is to become all that we envision for it. 
EDIT: While I found the middle of the discussion worth consideration, the end is not.
1. He imagines that if cryptocurrency is not money, then it "must" die out. Nonsense. Even if cryptocurrency does not replace fiat as money it's utilitarian advantages (such as ease and speed in sending value around the globe, censorship resistance and anonymity) provide an enduring reason to exist, quite apart from speculation in a scarce commodity.
2. As a goldbug he doesn't like crypto and therefore imagines it must be in a bubble, ignoring the utilitarian advantages (actually he just focuses on the negatives like money laundering, completely ignoring the positives in this respect). But consideration of those utilitarian advantages of cryptocurrency by other analysts has consistently had them predicting dramatically higher valuations for crypto, like the $2 Trillion market cap in 10 years that Moas just came out with. The author completely fails to consider this aspect of things.
3. The author speaks of fiat currencies as all falling in value relative to gold because he is gold-centric. But it would be more accurate to say they are falling in value relative to _any_ physical good, be it a loaf of bread, a lawnmower or a man's suit. Gold may not fall much in value relative to these other physical goods, but there's also no reason to think it will go up significantly either. Compare that with the potential for bitcoin and its easy to see why the goldbugs are, as usual, missing out and missing the point.

The problem with trying to arbitrage is that (1) the trading fees will eat up most of your gain, (2) transfer fees will eat up the rest and (3) you can't extract dollars from Bitfinex anyway, so unless you are using other fiat that's out of the question.
Skilled arbitragers do exist and I'm sure that do well with automated trading bots and at a high enough scale that they are getting charged the lowest tier of fees. For anyone wanting to do this manually, it's probably not worth the time/effort spent staring at a screen except on rare and generally unpredictable occasions.

The margin traders actually ran out of BTC at one point. There was nothing left right up to the 5% maximum on the Offer side for loans, and 300+ BTC requested by margin traders willing to pay the max 5% on the other side.
The margin traders who started early may have been the smart ones even paying those insane rates. My plan was to get my BTC back to Polo ASAP after the split and launch a bunch of margin trades. It's working and I'm up 10%, but I would have done a good deal better if I'd started a few days earlier, before the split. I feel like I'm one step ahead of the herd, but the smart money was 2 steps ahead...

Fees are related to transaction volume relative to the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Increasing adoption (and real-world use) as well as spam attacks will cause fees to rise. Changes that increase transaction capacity such as Segwit (once implemented) and off-chain transactions (such as the Lightning Network) will cause fees to decline. 
The fact that Segwit is activating should reduce fees once SW is actually active AND wallets and services have been upgraded to take advantage of it. So that will take some time and will happen gradually, not instantly at a given moment. But it should happen.

Miners are a self-interested faction. It's foolish to just measure one faction - one whose interests inherently conflict with actual users - and pretend that is a valid measure for everyone. 
This notion that miners should control bitcoin is absolute madness. They have been fighting to turn it into a cash cow and milk it to its own destruction through their short-sighted fight against scaling and fee reduction, since that cuts their profits.
Let users control bitcoin. They, like miners, are self-interested. But because they want a secure, safe, fast, efficient method of bitcoin TX, they will agree to pay a fair rate in the end, sufficient to obtain sufficient miners to achieve those ends. 
The Dev team agrees with this approach, and that's where so much of the conflict arises. The miners and businesses who make money off bitcoin users will always be trying to game the system in their favor, and they _must_ be relentlessly defeated. *Otherwise we're just trading Central Bank manipulators for a new band of manipulators in control of currency. *

1. 1 has nothing to do with bitcoin as such. A centralized government can use bitcoin same as anyone else, to pay for services like lights and roads.
2. What happens to an unused wallet? Nothing. People who die need to take thought regarding the inheritance they pass along, same as they have for thousands of years. Bitcoin is just one of those things they will need to consider. If they don't, and no one else knows where to find the password/seed/private key, then funds will be permanently lost. Just like cash and gold and lots of other things get permanently lost because someone buries them and then dies without tipping anyone off on where to find the stash.

The reality is that altcoins will continue to exploit niches that no single coin can, throughout the universe of financial transactions. Bitcoin needs to connect efficiently with those coins, not wall itself off and die (think AOL vs. the internet).

It has started, though they are stuck at the starting gate with no blocks so far.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:25:34
Well, you want to keep track of all your funds and where they are. In my case I got into crypto by building my own mining rig, and then mining whatever altcoin was most profitable, which meant constantly switching coins, finding new mining pools and mining on different ones, then switch back to old ones and so on. Then I would sell my coins for BTC, and tried trading into various other alts. 
So pretty quickly I had small quantities of alts all over the place at various mining pools (which either had an infrequent payout schedule or I had less than the minimum required for a withdrawal), as well as portfolios on multiple exchanges and wallets. Good record-keeping was a must.
Some of those "tiny" amounts ended up doing very well. I got 10,000 NEM for free when they launched; immediately sold them for 50 cents worth of BTC, buying them back for $10, and then selling this spring for over $2,000. (And since that went into bitcoin, which has since tripled... that was a nice almost-freebie.)
So yeah, track things carefully. It will be worth it not to lose track of anything. Even if you just hold bitcoin, you will likely want to hold it in multiple baskets (wallets, exchanges and so forth) to minimize the risk of losing it all at once.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:31:15
I caught the tale end of it; my guess is that these were small, underfunded firms without a lot of talent. With bitcoin an order of magnitude bigger now the profit potential is correspondingly larger, so I'm hopeful it will attract some bigger, better-funded competition.

Can you share the TX ID? If Coinjar says it is Pending then that means it sees the TX on the blockchain and just is waiting for more confirmations. This is needed in case the original TX ends up being on a block that gets orphaned (and thus excised from the blockchain when a longer fork replaces it). Once a set number of confirmations is reached (typically 3-6) the funds will be on Coinjar no problem.
Worst case if the TX is not being processed due to a really low fee the bitcoin will be available in your Electrum wallet again in about a week. But chances are good it will confirm over the weekend anyway since demand is lower then.

Miners want to kill off any competition. So they talk endlessly about block size increases while blocking and attacking off-chain solutions. Then they tried to delay any actual block size increase until they had no other choice.
So then they gamed the system by accelerating mining on their scamcoin (BCH) to compensate for the lack of fees. They then sell the increased flow of BCH blocks to the suckers who have bought into the propaganda. The suckers are left with a worthless scamcoin with no infrastructure and laughable development capabilities and the miners get more BTC at their expense.
The key to keeping this going is a flood of FUD against bitcoin to keep the suckers energized and buying BCH. Once that drops off the game is over for them.

In the end I expect it must be done, because mining centralization has already gotten out of hand and the deleterious effects of that are as plain as day.

You can buy fractions of a bitcoin - divisible down to satoshis (.00000001 bitcoin). Few people will deal in whole bitcoins in the future, or even now.

No. Blocks were not being mined every 10 minutes on average. Here's a better explanation:
In the short run they are letting miners earn great profits, selling accelerated mining rewards to the suckers boosting BCH. In the long run they reach halvening years sooner. When the BCH blockchain becomes clogged with spam, bloated in size and reduced mining rewards reduce hashpower to insecure levels, while Bitcoin booms to mass adoption via offchain scaling the big block cult may finally see they've made a mistake.

It all depends on how efficient your operation is. You can sit on the largest gold deposit on earth and lose money if you do a poor job managing costs in extracting it. Same for bitcoin mining.
In theory bitcoin mining should gravitate towards being a break-even activity for only the most efficient miners. In practice, and with the price rising strongly, miners should be doing very well for themselves this year.

What's the point of an off-topic and bigoted article like that? I became a creationist in college after growing up as an evolutionist, with no exposure to dissident ideas. One of the key elements in my shift came from reading both creationary and anti-creationary literature. I encourage everyone to do the same. For all the yelling about how people who believe in a God who will judge sin are lying, it became pretty obvious pretty quickly that it was the anti-creationists who have a terrible problem with honesty (not to mention acting like the religious fanatics they like to claim their are opposing). 
One irony here is that this article come from Richard Dawkin's site, a man who co-authored a few minor articles on insects early in his career and that's about it so far as scientific contributions go. Compare that with the work of a man like Cornell geneticist Dr. John Sanford, the inventor of the 'gene gun' genetic engineering technique and much other scientific work such that he was named Scientist of the Year by Progressive Farmer. Dr. Sanford's work in population genetics and genetic entropy is highly relevant to the development of scientific origins models, but feared and ignored because it challenges the religious foundations of evolutionism.
I can give you thousands of credentialed scientists who reject evolutionism; for that matter I've met far more engineers like myself who reject evolutionism than accept it over my career. The pathetic and highly emotional inability of evolutionists to admit that innumerable scientists past and present reject evolutionism as inconsistent with science and historical evidence speaks volumes.
Read both sides (exactly as evolutionists fear and fight as indicated by this link). If you grew up in a cult environment (that is to say, public school)  as I did you'll be learning a lot.

Gold has a modest value as an electrical conductor and so forth, but the bitcoin blockchain also has value for notary purposes and so forth. And so far as industrial use is concerned other metals can be substituted 99% of the time. I don't think the "genuine value" vs. "perceived value" distinction holds up. 
After 7 years bitcoin's worth is proving durable, even if volatile. I think it's only a matter of time before central banks and other institutions begin buying in, quietly or not.

"Dust" refers to small transactions (payments) that have come into your wallet. Whenever you send an outbound payment from your wallet the transaction has to reference precisely what bitcoins it is paying with. 
For example, say you receive 1 bitcoin each from A, B and C, and 3 bitcoins from D. If you want to spend 4.5 bitcoins your wallet will assemble a transaction that basically says "Spend the 3 bitcoins from D plus 1 from A and .5 from B - and send the remaining .5 bitcoin from B to E." (The new address is a change address, you can see them on a block explorer or in your wallet once they get generated). So you're left with 1 bitcoin from C and .5 from E for future transactions.
Wallets make each transaction as efficiently as they can, but the more input transactions they need to refer back to the larger your new transaction will be. So when you have a ton of tiny transactions in your wallet it makes your outbound transactions messy, since they have to reference a whole bunch of inputting transactions.
The way to fix this is to "sweep" the wallet by sending the entire amount in your wallet to a new address within the wallet, ideally at a time when fees are running extremely low. This consolidates all your inputs down to a single address, so all future transactions just need to reference it (or a subsequent change address).

It's basically a hangout for malcontents of the cryptocurrency world:
1. Conspiracy theorists convinced bankers are secretly manipulating and controlling bitcoin via the developers.
2. Big blockers who can't accept alternative methods to scaling or that there are downsides to big blocks.
3. Anyone who feels slighted by bitcoin developers or who has had a post deleted here (generally for perfectly good reasons) and decries 'censorship'. 
4. Miners and whales manipulating the above groups for profit and power. This particularly includes Jihan Wu who runs Bitmain (the largest Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturer) and controls a large chunk of mining directly and indirectly, and Roger Ver, who owns bitcoin.com and holder of several hundred thousand BTC. 
(You can google "Antbleed" and "ASICboost" for some of the shenanigans they've been up to, along with holding up Segwit for over a year for self-interested reasons masked with spurious arguments.)

Any software can be modified. And needs to be, to fix bugs/exploits, make improvements and so on.
I assume you are concerned with the idea of someone changing the economic characteristics of bitcoin, in  a manner similar to a Central Bank changing the money supply of fiat currency. While that can be done via a software change, reality is far more complicated:
Developers can make the change in software, but that doesn't mean anyone will use it. They have to be persuaded to use it. And it needs to be a strong majority who upgrade; ideally a unanimous vote or else you get division and controversy, a blockchain split and so forth. 
You're obviously new here because otherwise you'd know that we've been in such a state of division and conflict for a long time now, not over an economic change but merely scaling issues. A change to the economics of bitcoin would take everything to the level of nuclear warfare - which is why it's not going to happen. Not on Bitcoin at any rate.

The reason I had an account but never used them was because they apparently have a pro-Bitcoin Unlimited tilt. This spring they had a screwball episode where they locked down BTC for a couple weeks and played with releasing a BU token. With BTC locked down everyone was buying alts to withdraw, to the point where it caused alt prices on Coinmarketcap to get distorted, which led to me making a bad trade decision that cost me a fair bit before I caught on. I created an account to log on and investigate what they were up to.

It seems to me that the key is to keep barriers to entry low for lightning network channels. In other words, if anyone can start a LN channel then it won't be a problem if the LN becomes centralized (due to a few major players being able to offer the cheapest fees). If the major channel operators start behaving badly, anyone can then circumvent them and new channels will spring up.
Again, this only works if the barriers to entry are low for anyone wanting to establish a new LN channel. I can see LN hubs being centralized, but so long as there is a constant threat of competition this should not be an existential problem. It is something the devs and users will need to keep in mind evaluating all changes bearing on the LN down the road.

This rally has been unusual; this spring and on other occasional when BTC rallied the alts rallied more strongly. I guess this is the impact of SW activation. At some point traders will think about rebalancing their portfolios, and at the tempting low valuations outside bitcoin.
The funny thing about bitcoiners hating on altcoins is that most of their arguments look like they were taken verbatim from outsiders hating on bitcoin. You'd think they'd recognize the irony of that. Just as bitcoin has refused to die and has only flourished, the altcoin markets have refused to die and are flourishing as well (the present lull notwithstanding).

They pumped the price on BCH to attract mining hashpower at the right time. That sucked miners off BTC creating slower confirmations and a backlog in TX.

Everyone values rationality and tries to be reasonable in their own thinking, so the only thing that sets self-annointed rationalists apart from others is their lack of self-criticism (because, you know, they're _rational_) and inability to appreciate other viewpoints (because if they come from those hoi-polloi _non-rationalists_, what's the point of considering them?)

Agreed. There is also the problem of airline flight times. 
Apparently the dominant flat earth  theory has the north pole at the center of a flat disk, with the continents spread out around it. As such continents in the southern hemisphere (to use standard parlance) are much further away from each other than northern continents. (I'm not sure what they do with Antarctica - I guess that would be part of the big conspiracy). 
Anyway, in this model flights between locations in the southern continents should be dramatically longer than would be the case for a standard globe model. But the actual flight times match the globe model and contradict the flat earth model.

Once  you have a significant amount you should move it off the exchange (Coinbase) to an offline wallet of your choice to keep it safe. Keeping it online and letting someone else control the keys is not safe, as any crypto veteran can attest to with a flood of examples. Make sure your wallets are safe, secure, and backed up (with a safely secured copy outside the physical location of your primary copy in case of fire/flood/earthquake etc.)
Dollar-cost averaging with a budgeted amount weekly or monthly is a good way to go, especially since Coinbase makes it easy to set that up via bank/credit card links.

There are a million scams out there where someone sends you a check and then asks you to pay out in some manner (there are many methods besides Bitcoin) before it clears. Everyone should have the basic awareness to never ever do this, particularly with people you don't know personally.
(For example, list something like a riding lawn mower on Craigslist, and I guarantee you'll get a half dozen or more scammers pushing just this type of scam). 
You can report it to police, but I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for anything to come of it. Consider it an expensive lesson.

It's more complicated than "wait for the weekend" now. You also have to calculate the BCH mining epicycles where their profitability soars and dives, sucking in most of the miners from Bitcoin. 
Once the miners tear through another 2016 blocks on BCH (doesn't take very long), they'll revert back to Bitcoin. TX backlog and fees will drop off, until the BCH EDA triggers again and their mining difficulty plummets and the whole stupid cycle begins again.
Someone should work out a prediction tool to help people estimate when they should send Bitcoin TX until this is sorted out.

The folks mentioning dollar cost averaging have the right idea. YOU ARE NOT LATE. Compared to the entire population you are still close to being an early adopter. Look around at friends and family - how many of them already are investing and using cryptocurrencies? Probably not many.
Just hang tough if it turns out we are at the top of another cycle. I started in crypto in January 2014. If you look at the historical charts you'll see my first year was ugly. But I doubled down investing in 2015 and 2016. In May of this year I cashed out $1000 more than I ever invested, total, for charitable contributions, and I still am up almost 2000%.

You should be providing the fee/byte of your TX. That's the relevant measurable. The chart shows how many TX have been confirmed and are waiting in the mempool currenty for each range by that measureable, and how long they estimate you will wait based on where your TX falls.
I'd take the estimates with a big grain of salt though, because they likely can't estimate well with BCH yo-yoing all over the place in mining difficulty, with miners jumping back and forth between it and Bitcoin.

That's a cool idea. I really appreciate the White Hats out there and what they are doing. (And how it debunks the image of crypto as dominated by criminals.)
Kinda on-topic, today I finally decided to go hunting for a couple fractions of some crypto that I mined back in 2014 and have kept on my tracking spreadsheets, but never bothered to retrieve from the mining pools because the amounts were so low. 
I knew I had logged 0.027 DASH as being somewhere, but I didn't list which pool! So I started plunking in old pool web addresses. Most are defunct, but one darkcoin (the original name of Dash) pool address redirected to a new one. I logged in and found not 0.027, but .134 Dash. 
That's like finding a couple $20 bills stuck in your couch. Made my day. :-)

Congrats BCH FUDsters. You've sucked the miners over to mining a worthless coin that no one is actually using, while people that actually want to use cryptocurrency are left hanging. Just another example of how Bitcoin's enemies behave.

It's a question of the exchange or online wallet service and whom they have trusted agreements with. Purse.io works with Coinbase so that they don't actually have to transfer bitcoin on the blockchain every time you "send" bitcoin from your Coinbase account to your Purse account. Instead when you spend your bitcoin on Purse, Purse just reports it to Coinbase and Coinbase in their internal accounting shifts the bitcoin to Purses's account on Coinbase.
I imagine there are a number of other examples (some faucets work with way I believe, though I haven't checked them out in a couple years). But it's still rare as a whole.

It's not something you need to rush into by any means. And it's still somewhat of a beta project. If you want to roll up your sleeves and begin playing with it that's great, but rest assured that much more user friendly interfaces will be developed before it matures enough for general consumer use.
You're probably not missing anything except maybe the chance to earn a really trivial amount relaying TX, and the experience gained.

1. Satoshi was really smart himself, and very disciplined. He was careful not to mention any personal details or anecdotes that would have dropped clues about himself. Apart from a few ideological comments that indicate a high regard for individual liberty we know very little about him beyond what he did in creating Bitcoin.
2. He was an expert in cryptography, which meant that for years he was involved in exactly the sort of technologies you use to cover your digital tracks. That was all part and parcel of the foundational elements of Bitcoin.
3. He disappeared before people became more intensely interested or motivated in unmasking him.
4. It's possible some people do know his identity. There was someone the other day claiming the NSA knew who he was from stylometric analysis (comparing his writings with other material from known authors). This strikes me as plausible, though no evidence of the claim was offered. It's quite possible that a small number of people at the NSA or similar agencies have identified him, but as there is no legitimate governmental purpose in blurting out his identity(and it would be a massive invasion of privacy to unmask someone worth $5 billion dollars to the public eye), they should be professional enough to keep their mouths tightly shut.

If  BCH hyperinflates through a couple halvenings it will see greatly reduced mining rewards. If it is still unused and blocks are not full there will be no fee pressure, so fees will stay near zero.

How many bitcoin Satoshi mined is disputed and unknown. Someone came up with "1 million" a long time ago but based on only fairly vague speculation (I don't know why this lawsuit settled on a figure of 1.1 million). I recall that Gregory Maxwell, an early Bitcoin adopter, opined the figure was more likely in the neighborhood of 500K.
It would be interesting to see a blockchain analysis of all bitcoins mined prior to certain points, such as Satoshi's last public communication, or various benchmarks such as when it reached $1/BTC, and see how many of the early coins have never moved. This wouldn't tell us how many Satoshi holds, but it would tell us how many are being held by very early adopters - or for which the keys have been lost because of lack of foresight and carelessness by early miners.

One aspect of this is that people who save their money are being punished and people who live irresponsibly and go into debt are being bailed out, in essence. Savers have absolutely no upside potential now in German bonds, but plenty of risk if at any time in the next thirty years inflation kicks in (or worse). As such bondholders will be looking _anywhere_ for a better alternative. A scarce currency with no risk of the monetary supply inflating (i.e., Bitcoin) will look like a promising alternative to more and more people.

1. Yes, any wallet under your control, or any other exchange that is supporting the fork (see 
2. You'd have to check w. each exchange. They will probably all be shutting down withdrawals for some amount of time.
3. Perhaps, but keep in mind the goal of B2X was to completely replace the old chain. That's why they did not do any replay protection. Without an EDA and with no replay protection I think it's very unlikely to survive for very long. In fact I think it may wind up almost stillborn, with only a few blocks produced before petering off to nothing.

Miners are paid the transaction fees for each TX they record on a block as well as the block reward of new bitcoin. So once there are no new bitcoins being mined it will continue to run on the fees, which have already become a significant proportion of miner earnings.

This may help:
_"Hydroelectric dams exploit storage of gravitational potential energy. A mass, m, raised a height, h against gravity, g = 10 m/s², is given a potential energy E = mgh. The result will be in Joules if the input is expressed in meters, kilograms, and seconds (MKS, or SI units). Water has a density of ρ = 1000 kg/m³, so if we know how many cubic meters of water flow through the dam each second (F), the power available to the dam will be P = ηρFgh. We have inserted η to represent the efficiency of the dam—usually around 90% (η≈0.90).
The height of the water behind the dam is the relevant height for the potential energy calculation, even if a given parcel of water is collected at the bottom of the dam. This is because the pressure of the water above provides the motive force. In the absence of turbines or other restrictions, the water would emerge from the penstock at a velocity of v = sqrt(2gh) so that a flow, F, would require an area A = F/v. For example, Hoover Dam, at 222 m high (in the days when Lake Mead was full!) would eject water at a stunning 67 m/s (150 m.p.h.) if a big hole opened up in the bottom. At the nominal flow rate of 1000 m³/s, this corresponds to a hole about 4 m in diameter. I think we should do it.
Now, it is the job of the turbine(s) to extract some of the kinetic energy this water would have if it were allowed to shoot out of the bottom of the dam. As a consequence, it comes out at a much more sedate pace. Some of the 10% inefficiency in hydroelectric dams is due to generator inefficiency, but some is because you can’t take all of the kinetic energy out of the water or it would stop flowing and stall the flow of the next batch. But nature is kind here, since kinetic energy goes as the square of the velocity. The velocity of the energy-sapped water is therefore sqrt(1 − η). So if we pull 96% of the energy out of the water, its flow velocity is 20% of the free-flow value (13 m/s in the foregoing example). Or we can grab 99% at a 10% exit speed (7 m/s, or 15 m.p.h.). This sounds much more reasonable—and seems like a good bargain. The area needed now expands accordingly, but that’s what large turbines/penstocks are for."_
I ran through the math here... with a hypothetical 100% efficient system you could get 10 kilowatts from 1 cubic meter of water/second flow rate, dropping a height of 1 meter. In the video they cite a 1.8 cubic meter/second flow rate and a 1.7 meter drop, so that could indeed yield 15 kw when real-world efficiencies are factored in.

The world is full of dangerous things and one role of parents is to train and teach their children how to deal with them safely. When I lived in Illinois there is a statute that requires gun owners to secure their firearms so their children could not use them. I kept mine in various bedroom locations that, physically, a child could easily access. But they all had a perfectly clear understanding of the danger and power of firearms and of my clear instructions to them, and they had learned obedience such that I judged it to be no risk. And I would have forcefully argued the point with a judge that the firearms were in fact secured - by my instruction and directives and their obedience - as well as if they'd been in a safe.
Millions of disarmed people have been slaughtered by oppressive governments as well as criminals. Millions of crimes are prevented or mitigated by judicious use of firearms. While tragic, the much tinier numbers of accidental fatalities should not be a dominant consideration in overall assessment of firearm ownership and availability.

It's not a speed thing, it's a capacity thing. (Which does relate back to speed but not directly.) The blocks occur at the same rate (10 minute nominal average). 2X increased the block size to increase the capacity to write transactions. Sounds like a good idea but not really because (1) it increases costs to run a node and (2) doesn't really solve the problem of mass adoption - we need solutions that are 1000X better not 2X better.
The bigger problem was that the 2X effort was really an effort to seize control of Bitcoin's development by a miner/business cartel. There were some pretty candid comments from them about "firing Core" (Core being the entire development community for Bitcoin). But they never talk about who's controlling changes if they are not coming from the development community. In the future if "Core" was fired by default it would mean only the miners would be deciding on what becomes of the Bitcoin protocol. They've proven to be a self-interested and partly toxic bunch. (Google "Covert ASICBoost" and "Antbleed" for example.)
There is also the issue of safe development. The Core community is world-class and has a solid process for evaluating changes, testing them and implementing them. The "2X" effort stumbled repeatedly with serious bugs and now we see that had they tried to fork they would have hilariously failed due to yet another bug in their code. That's a disastrous way to run a $130 billion project.

We've lived through plenty of busts with Bitcoin (if you've been around long enough). So people should not be in denial about it.

I used to criticize Bitcoin myself for being too slow and other imagined shortcomings, compared to other altcoins. Bitcoin was the Model T of Crypto, I declared. Ford produced and sold huge numbers of Model T's over the years, but was slow to recognize when it had become technologically outmoded and in desperate need of replacement. It almost killed the company. I thought Bitcoin might follow the same path.
I don't think so any longer. Off-chain TX and atomic swaps address the issue of slow TX for everyday purchases. And there are huge numbers of devs involved with Bitcoin - not just the team we think of as "Core" but the thousands more working on Bitcoin-related projects in hundreds of different companies. Each advance they bring makes Bitcoin a little bit stronger.
There is a lot of good stuff going on among the better altcoins too, but it is all far too splintered among too many altcoins for there to be a serious challenger.

1. Latest figures show it dropping sharply (75.7% for the last 24 hours as I write).

3. Futures markets show B2X fading. It is only worth ~0.13 BTC at this point and has been weakening the last few days. Miners will only earn 1/7 the revenue with it compared to sticking with Bitcoin. A blogger yesterday worked out that it will cost miners $100 million in the first 10 days to favor B2X over Bitcoin. Not likely they will waste that kind of money.

All socialism is theft by definition. Your idea of pooling risks is not socialism.
For example, let's say 100-year old houses are twice as likely to burn down compared to new houses. If the government required insurance companies to charge the same premium to owners of both century-old and new houses that would be socialism. But if the owner of the old house has to pay twice the premium because of the risk difference then that is not socialism.

The 51 days to Dec. 31 only pertains to Bitfinex futures, and is totally separate from Ver's bet. 
If even a single block of B2X is mined before 2018 it will establish B2X as a separate coin and trigger the conversion of BT2 tokens into B2X and BT1 tokens into BTC on Bitfinex.
December 31 has no significance that I notice in Ver's wager with Charlie Lee and company. IIRC their wager just stipulates that once 100 blocks are mined they have 2 weeks to complete their transactions, with Ver getting their B2X and Lee and the others getting Ver's BTC. 
One shortcoming I now see in the agreement Lee published (and Ver published on r/btc) is that there is no end date in their agreement. They've agreed to each set aside 250 BTC per wager to demonstrate proof of ownership of the funds to be wagered and not touch it. But what if only a very small, but dedicated hashrate gets applied to mining B2X? They could literally take years to mine 100 blocks and since the agreement doesn't specify a deadline all the parties might be compelled to keep the wagered funds in limbo for the duration. Not likely, but it's possible.

Speaking as someone who first got into cryptocurrency in January 2014 (when BTC was going from $1000 to under $200 in the following year) I have some advice: Just buy and don't worry about it. When it starts dropping, take the opportunity to buy more. That worked out very well for me.
So long as the tech behind Bitcoin is not fundamentally broken and it is the market leader, over the long term it is still only a small fraction of its real value.

The original patent (outside China) was by Lerner IIRC. Jihan Wu at Bitmain has the Chinese patent. Not clear if he blatantly ripped it off or has any kind of agreement with Lerner. At any rate Wu's probably just keeping it for himself, as he directly controls a lot of hashpower.

I merely pointed out that once you accept Scripture as such, certain conclusions follow from verses such as II Tim. 3:16. It is therefore inconsistent to apply lines of reasoning that conflict with such statements within those premises.
The notion that you can wish away Scripture based on silly conjectures like the one you mention is sad and doesn't remotely address the more serious arguments pro and con. I'm astonished at how anti-Christian scholarship has degenerated into farce since I became a Christian in a university environment several decades ago. If you ever read the Bible with anything approaching a sober intellect you'll soon realize the "magic mushroom" approach to wishing it away is not serious.

BCH supporters were worried that B2X succeeding might leave their coin without a place in the market. now that B2X is pretty much dead, BCH has a place (they believe).
Really though, it's just an under-developed altcoin that compares poorly to Litecoin as a low-fee alternative to Bitcoin. Once all is said and done I expect the market caps to reflect that.

Fiat currencies collapse with regularity, as examples from (A)rgentina to (Z)imbabwe regularly show. So they certainly "can" collapse, and the fact that it has terrible consequences for populations dependent on the dying currency does not prop it up in the final stages.
We can say we hope major fiat currencies won't collapse - but our goodwill won't be worth anything if they begin a spiral into hyperinflationary death. Best just to be ready in case or when it happens.

Bitcoin has had Segwit for several months and several other cryptos have had Segwit for months longer, all with no issues that anyone can point at to justify skepticism. At what point do we realize the "concerns" about Segwit were all FUD from miners trying to block/delay off-chain scaling?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:20:15
The CME caused a jump, but then it leveled off for almost a day. The current surge came precisely after Coinbase announced that they will not try to call B2X "Bitcoin" for at least 2 weeks after the fork.
That eliminated fears that Coinbase will try to foist off B2X as "Bitcoin" as part of the takeover attempt. Miners are not going to mine only 1/7 the revenue they could be getting for 2 weeks. So the chances of B2X winning are now much reduced, and that is why Bitcoin is soaring.

It goes without saying that anyone holding crypto should consider what happens to their coins when they die. Not if. Given it is a certainty and that you don't know the timing, you should have a plan to make sure your portfolio is distributed according to your will.

Nice story-telling, but that's all it is so far as the main thesis goes. I'd point out that there are major exchanges like Poloniex and Bittrex that do just fine without handling fiat exchanges, which blows holes in this whole story as far as I can see.
I've noticed Tether supply on Coinmarketcap drop on occasion. Not much, but I'm pretty sure I was not hallucinating.
BTW, I am currently in the process of signing up for an institutional account with Tether. Hopefully it will not be a 5 month wait like it was for my personal account (their email on the subject gives me some hope I may not wind up in the main queue. We'll see.)

If you wait it out you should be fine. I don't expect two chains to survive for long. 
Worst case, if for some reason both chains do survive for a long while, you'll need to learn how to split your coins so that the coins on each fork can be safely spent. Trezor should provide instructions on how to do this if they haven't already. For the paper wallet you'll need to find a guide on how to do it sometime, but if you are just keeping the coins on it long term it shouldn't be any rush.

That would be my counsel. It's hard to say, and it's very painful watching bitcoin rise with cash on the sidelines (I sold a chunk 2 days ago as a hedge). It's just that the fork looks to be very ugly right now and the message of complacency from Core ( is not reassuring. Hopefully its misdirection or irrelevant and market support for Bitcoin overwhelms all other factors. But the lack of replay protection and the likely fallout from that leads me to believe there will be a very negative news cycle hitting in a week or so and extending until there is a clear victory for the Core chain after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:38:11
Its a scamcoin produced by miners trying to keep all TX flowing through only miners so they get all the TX revenue. They are constantly misrepresenting BCH as "Bitcoin" to newbies, and people are losing Bitcoin as well as BCH all the time due to them copying the same address format.
BCH supporters tend to be cult-like followers of Roger Ver (Bitcoin Judas) and Craig Wright (Fake Satoshi), and unconcerned with the centralization of nodes and mining if their coin were a success. This is antithetical to the freedom offered by cryptocurrency as it makes it easier for a government or other bad actors to achieve influence and control over the currency.
Most of the other top altcoins out there have their own projects and use cases that make them valid. BCH does not. It's just a scam ripping off the "Bitcoin" name at the expense of newbies and fanboys.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:33:32
It's really just a rough estimate that has since fossilized. I'm pretty sure nullc (Gregory Maxwell), who was into bitcoin pretty early himself, estimated that Satoshi's holdings may be more like 1/2 that amount. I think he's a little more credible (since I don't actually know if the 1 million figure is from any kind of analysis at all), so that's what I personally lean towards.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:00:29

People have some vague but unproven concerns about USDT (otherwise known as Tether). But nothing has come of it and it's been around for a good while now by crypto standards. It's basically because of some legalese in their fine print, that totally contradicts/denies the basic intent and function of the coin to be convertible to US dollars.
I signed up back in June on their website to enable deposits/withdrawals of fiat (USD) to convert into Tether. At the current rate in their queue I might actually get my application reviewed by the end of the year. Then I'll be able to test it out and see whether it is possible to deposit and withdraw seamlessly.
Keep in mind that while they are giving out Tethers for every dollar deposited, the can earn interest on the dollars they are holding. With almost $500 million in deposits (if we take CoinmarketCap figures at face value), that means the could be earning $15 million annually at just 3% interest. Even deducting some operational expenses that's very profitable for the tether outfit, and if they don't pull an exit scam as some fear they can expect to grow and become even more profitable in the future. So I'm not as concerned as some that there's anything shady going on. They have a potentially very lucrative idea going here.

We should not rush it, but ASIC-based centralization has been a problem, is a problem, and is going to remain a problem. If we could take a time machine back to, say, 2015 and described for them what we've been going through I have no doubt the devs would be horrified and would start making immediate plans to change PoW. 
Instead we're in a frog-boiling-in-a-pot situation, and so even now with the water boiling and a constant mess on our hands we're slow to realize the magnitude of the crisis since it has become an everyday affair. More ASICs will not fix the problem. We need to get away from ASICs.

He quit before they were worth much of anything, so it's not that remarkable that he just left them sitting. If he's not dead and did ever want to do anything with his coins he will find a way to do it that minimizes panic in the market.
For example, he could publish a notice (with a signature from the Genesis block to prove it authentic) stating his intention to sell X coins, but not the rest. The sale would take place at such-and-such date (not too soon), via an auction mechanism or the OTC market on Bitfinex (where whales can buy/sell bitcoin off the market so it doesn't affect the order books). 
It would still have an impact, but it would be 90% reduced if he gave everyone time to digest the news and the sale was off the books.

It's really not _that_ hard, if you keep your head. My advice to people is always to write out a short statement of why they think investing in "X" coin is a good idea. If you can do that and it makes sense after you've written it out and stared at it, give it a shot.
So long as we're citing selective statistics I'd point out that the  100th coin on Coinmarket cap was worth $694,000 on January 1 this year. Right now the 100th coin is $55 million even after this little crash. Those who invested in Ethereum or Dash or Stellar in their first year have made wildly more money at this point than with BTC, so your list is misleading. It merely underscores the potential for accelerating returns by judging when to step in and step out. Now is a good time to be going in to alts in general, looking at Coinmarket cap and your list.

You don't mine bitcoin with computers anymore. ASICs are thousands of times more efficient. You'd mine for many hours to earn 1 satoshi (1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin). A few months ago someone reported taking 33 hours to earn 1 satoshi with a MacBook Air, and difficulty has leaped up quite a bit since then.
You can look into mining altcoins that use different algorithms, though you'd want to have a bank of GPU's for it to be worthwhile (and it would still be only a few dollars/day tops). It is a good way to put yourself neck-deep into cryptocurrency to learn more about it.

It has no natural base of support, occupying a position between BCH and BTC with nothing to recommend it. It is actually a downgrade from 0.15.01 back to 0.14 due to lack of developer support. Futures markets show it down to 12% the value of Bitcoin and dropping.
There is no EDA so miners will be mining it at a huge loss under current market conditions. ViaBTC has said they won't offer B2X mining when it forks and BTC.top has said they will mine the most profitable chain. Both are signaling NYA but this means neither would mine B2X. Along with F2Pool, Slush, Kano, and some other smaller pools/miners the NYA team is dangerously close to losing 50% miner support before the first block is mined.
My expectation is either they will call it off in the last few days, or it will straggle out of the gate with less than 50% of miners and the price will plummet as soon as Bitcoiners can dump it as there will be virtually no buyers without miner support. At that point Roger Ver, a big BCH/B2X backer, will work to kill it off since he loses millions of dollars worth of wagered bitcoin if B2X reaches 100 blocks with no or little value.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:09:34
It's also an issue of governance. The other sub (whether they admit it to themselves or not) puts miners in a state of total control over their coin. That's proven to be a disastrous mistake, as it led to the miners blocking off-chain scaling for a year or more with Bitcoin (as that would cost them their monopoly on TX fees).

Of course segwit is helping. Even if the blocksize is only 10% larger that is reducing fee pressure by that amount. That means ~10% of users are not being forced to drop out of the competition to get their TX in the blockchain by a bidding war that drives fees higher until they drop out of the bidding.
It's simple logic. Every TX today is lower - not 10% lower, probably more like 50-70% lower - than if segwit didn't exist. And if we could get decent segwit adoption fees would likewise be back down to minimal levels. Thus the fierce hostility and undermining of segwit at every turn by bitcoin's enemies.

No exchanges of any significance have said they will call B2X "bitcoin" without a waiting period and proof of market support. It's dead barring some stunning backroom deal, the results of which would be a catastrophic tanking of the value and price of bitcoin, followed by emergency PoW changes by Core and a rebirth. There's no scenario I can think of where the NYA attackers win this (unless their whole intent was to attack Bitcoin just to hurt the price.)
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:37:52
BTC is the pre-eminent store of value, and that won't change easily or quickly. ETH is for smart contracts and ICOs, but those keep blowing up (The DAO, Parity) or turning into scams at a rapid rate, making me less bullish than most about ETH. If you want exposure to ICO's and versatility I'd go with something like Stellar - much lower market cap means it has room to rise a lot, and it is becoming competitive in both the ICO market in addition to competing with Ripple as a bank and personal value transfer mechanism.

Look at the long term strength of BTC vs. BCH. Where is their dev team? What are the technical upgrade plans? How much infrastructure and services out there supports BCH?

In addition to the limits on how QC can threaten Bitcoin, keep in mind that the rest of the financial world will be even more vulnerable to QC breaching passwords and so on. At least with Bitcoin there is a massive concentration of cryptography experts and awareness of QC risks. Whereas the traditional banking system and smaller financial systems have much lower awareness and will likely be more vulnerable if and when QC becomes a reality.

Yes and no. There are rumors some miners will try to mine it. But since it was always a very centralized affair and the leaders have announced it dead, any such effort is basically just a pointless temper tantrum. My guess is the rumors are circulated by bagholders of futures tokens who are trying to pump up the deflated price of their tokens to try to recover at least a little of their losses at the expense of some poor gullible latecomer.

I was very concerned a few days ago, but with news of Coinbase backing off and mining pools saying they won't even give an option to mine B2X to their miners initially, I'm not very concerned any more.

The difficulty adjusts automatically to recalibrate the amount of mining hashrate to keep solving blocks every 10 minutes (on average). So long as bitcoiners are paying fees or there is a block reward of new bitcoins there will be financial incentive to mine, and the amount of mining will calibrate itself to that incentive.

On the demand side, the ATH's we keep hitting are probably driving an unusual amount of activity with people shuttling coins to and from exchanges.
Two reasons spring to mind on the capacity side:
1. Many wallets and exchanges (including NYA supporters crying about the need for more capacity) have still not enabled Segwit support. That's holding down the max block sizes significantly.
2. BCH is grabbing miners again ( resulting in very fast blocks on it, and slower blocks on Bitcoin. This should end once the EDA is disabled on BCH (scheduled for 11/13).

I fully agree with the gist of the discussion. We can (and  no doubt will) keep dealing with it one by one here, but some general education tools in prominent places will no doubt help as well.
And in the meantime, any poorly framed statements by Cobra Bitcoin or others will be seized upon by Ver and his cabal and waved like a bloody flag to manipulate his followers into a frenzy.

The price has started spiking up because:
1. Coinbase announced they would not call B2X "bitcoin" for at least 2 weeks, eliminating the concern that they as a NYA backer would try to foist off the NYA coin as Bitcoin, creating confusion and dissension.
2. ViaBTC, despite signaling for NYA, announced that they wouldn't even bother offering the choice of mining B2X when it forks. I think BTC.top might also be going this direction. 
B2X only had strength among miners and a few large Crypto businesses, so Coinbase's announcement and major mining pools backing off means B2X is pretty well dead as competition to Bitcoin. That's why you see the price soaring, because the fork could have been very ugly otherwise.

If the private keys are truly lost they will stay lost forever (barring a quantum computing advance that may help in some situations). 
OTOH, I wouldn't be surprised if the rise in value of Bitcoin prompts some spectacular efforts to track down and locate missing private keys. For example, consider this case:
That hard drive is now worth over $50 million. At some point it may make a lot of sense to mount a major industrial salvage operation in the landfill where it is probably located. Can you imagine a purpose-built facility and heavy equipment being brought on site to dig through the entire landfill, sifting it for the hard drive in question? Then sending it to a state of the art forensics recovery lab to try to recover the key (even in a bad scenario where it is unreadable it might be possible to reconstruct enough of the key to brute force the rest if they can recover most of the bytes).

I looked somewhat carefully into the risks associated with either a (mass) EMP attack or a solar Carrington-class event a few years ago. I ended up deciding the doomsday-scenarios are unlikely even in a worst-case scenario.
Could such an event be devastating and lead to widespread mortality? Yes. Would it be the end of civilization? No. 
For example, while a lot of vehicles would be disabled by such an event, the reality is that only a small portion of vehicle traffic on the roads today is "essential" to survival. In a pure-survival situation, travel for personal recreation, or to a job that is not producing food or other necessities or for other non-essential purposes is essentially waste. Would there be enough vehicles (old cars, tractors, ATV's, jury-rigged trucks and so forth) for essential transport until we could bootstrap our way back up from the disaster? Yes. 
I'm sure copies of the blockchain would be backed up somewhere and could be re-introduced even if the grid was fully knocked out globally. Whether we'd be interested in doing so at that point is another question. But humanity would survive (it's silly to think otherwise, given humanity was doing just fine without electricity until less than 200 years ago.)

Short answer: Yes.
Less short answer: Yes, you can buy a fund called GBTC ( which provides exposure to Bitcoin. Each share basically buys you approximately .092 BTC. Downsides: You don't hold the private keys, and they charge 2%/year for the privilege, and the shares sell at a premium that may reduce or disappear.
Long answer: Yes, but you need to set up a Self-Directed IRA. Doing so was fairly straightforward for me, though I had to follow extensive instructions and jump through a fair number of hoops. All well worth it though. Now I can buy not just Bitcoin but all cryptos and hold them in my self-directed IRA. I hold the keys for it all (apart from my investment into Tim Enneking's Crypto Asset Fund). 
I set up my self-directed IRA through Broad Financial ( Cost was a flat fee around $1500 (exact amount depends on what state you are in for LLC registration), plus a couple hundred/year in custodial fees. But if you have a large amount to invest that's better than some competitors that charge a percentage fee that gets hefty for large investments.

It's an attempt to destroy the Bitcoin blockchain and replace it with one under the control of the NYA signatories. 
We have scaling via Segwit, sidechains, the Lightning Network, Schnorr Signatures, MAST and more. Bigger blocks was the worst possible way to scale, that's why everyone except the miners (who think of themselves as losing out from all alternative forms of scaling) favored the route via Segwit. Which, I might add, the NYA signatories are still dragging their feet about implementing, despite crying crocodile tears about scaling.

Not really. Coinbase initially said so and then walked it back and said they would wait at least 2 weeks. Here's a rundown that is not too out of date:
It's no longer 80% if we take recent statements of miners at face value. Slush, F2Pool, and a couple smaller pools and anonymous miners have all stopped signaling, amounting to about 22% of hashrate by my math (last 24 hours is even lower). And ViaBTC and BTC.top were quoted in Coindesk a few days ago indicating they will either not be mining B2X to start or will go with the more profitable chain. 
That drops the NYA below 60%.  Given the trend and the cost of mining a lower value chain (and seeing miners chase value on the BCH EDA for ven slight gains), I very much doubt  50% of miners will be mining the NYA fork when it comes time. If they are below 50% it's pretty much DOA.

It's an attempt to attack and destroy the Bitcoin blockchain, replacing it with alternative that breaks consensus and is under the control of miners and the remaining NYA signers. If that's not an attack what would it take for you to recognize something as an attack?
The NYA CEO's who remain wedded to it are obviously clueless. Otherwise they'd realize the damage they are doing to their businesses by driving customers away and becoming detested by the Bitcoin community. 
You've distorted when he said relating to ethereum. His point was that the NYA leaders are openly anti-bitcoin. It's fine to have such an opinion, but don't pretend to be a leader who should be in charge of Bitcoin while you are expressing such an opinion and expect anything other than derision.

That's my concern. We have a very positive news cycle right now with the price skyrocketing. If the fork did not exist that would still end at some point and a correction will hit. It looks like we may hit a double-whammy of a natural correction coming and then a negative news cycle of downbeat stories of newbies losing their bitcoin, mainstream media stories of a "Bitcoin civil war" and accounts of confusion over exchanges labeling two different coins "Bitcoin." 
My biggest fear is that the miners stay with the NYA long enough that the price is hammered on the Bitcoin fork, but not enough to make B2X as profitable. At that point the mining leaders may recognize that time is their enemy - if Bitcoin remains more profitable miners will eventually peel off to mine it and the NYA fork will die. But if they have over 67% of the hashrate they can simultaneously maintain their own fork and empty-block mine the Bitcoin fork to effectively shut it down completely. (See 
That would really tank the price, until Core came up with a way to fence the miners out (a PoW change for example) - which would take some time during which any recovery would be extremely muted due to the inability to move any coins.

In essence yes, though it is short-sighted behavior. Abandoning BTC for BCH would not lead to a victory for BCH so much as it would lead to a catastrophic wave of negative media coverage ("BTC finally dies") and a flight from all cryptocurrency (as we saw over the weekend when the whole market tanked) if BTC truly foundered. At best BCH would be the rump leader of a greatly diminished, disillusioned and demoralized cryptocurrency market with much greater centralization among the survivors.

I've a similar background (engineer w. 4 college classes in economics). I know some schools of economics treat deflationary currency like Bitcoin (in the long run) like the Bubonic plague, but I think it's overblown.
First, I'll admit to being less concerned that most economists with the idea of a "booming economy." That emphasis leads to continual tweaking and manipulation that puts the emphasis on charts and numbers, which don't necessarily relate to the real world.
For example, you can respond to a recession by printing money and then enforcing a law putting all otherwise-unemployed men to work digging pointless ditches and then filling them in again, while paying them a "living wage" to do so. This makes the economic numbers look good, but it doesn't produce any real world value. If what people really wanted is new houses and cars and food on the table, government programs to dig ditches distract the men sucked into it from being able to produce real goods and services of value.
People can only hold on to their money so long before they have to buy some food, or a new car, or need to move out of the drafty old house, or buy Christmas presents. Bitcoins' "deflation rate" through gradual loss once mining ends would be small enough that people aren't going to see much change from month to month like can happen in a mismanaged fiat economy. (This is especially true if it becomes extremely valuable as a dominant currency.) So I doubt deflationary HODLing will have that dramatic  of an effect.
And we can't discount the role of a multitude of other cryptocurrencies. They aren't going to go away no matter how bitcoin maximalists wish it so. Whether governments could successfully create and impart with value some currencies of their own in a Bitcoin-dominated financial system remains to be seen, but I suspect we now live in an era of constant introductions of new cryptocurrencies that will tend to counteract Bitcoins' deflationary tendencies.
Just my 2 satoshis.

Fiat is a poor store of value due to inflation.
If Bitcoin levels out, as it invariably must at some point, then it becomes more usable as it levels off.
As it stands I'm kicking myself for using Purse.io to buy a bunch of stuff this past week. 10-15% discount is not enough to make up for the increasing value of Bitcoin in the week or more it takes to move the fiat I'm sending to replace it via GDAX.

It's called "buy the dip". Institutional money will be pouring in to buy cheap BTC after a FUD/pump campaign by BCH pumpers/supporters ahead of their Nov. 13 fork. They needed to pump their price ahead of the end of their EDA to secure enough hashrate to not be vulnerable to constant attack by any decent sized mining pool that wanted to jack with them.
Plus it was a beautiful opportunity for pump-and-dump operators. For a pump-and-dump you want to find a coin with a population of emotionally invested supporters, and pick the right time to fleece them. BCH is the perfect example of the former, and this timing in the aftermath of the collapse of B2X, with BCH being the sole alternative for big blockers, was the perfect time. 
The BCH supporters now have lots of BCH, and the pump-and-dumpers now have a lot of their BTC.

I've spent a lot of effort the past month or so exploring the potential for arbitrage and laying the groundwork to take advantage. When it gets down to it, it's a ton of work and not remotely as easy as people think. 
Have you mapped out the fees on each exchange? The wire transfer fees in and out of your bank? Do you have a tether account? (Be prepared for a  6 month wait if you don't.) Oh wait, you'll need to make that a corporate account if you want to actually be able to redeem the tether. And you can handle the $100,000 minimum TX with Tether, right?
And you know which exchanges deal with USD and which are actually dealing with Tether, right? Have you checked with your bank and understand any issues with international wire transfers? Of course they'll be asking questions given the $100K minimum every time you transfer. To your corporate account if using Tether, keep in mind. Don't want to get them mixed up. 
Of course, with amounts that large you'll need to keep slippage in mind. And beware the oddities of each individual exchange - Bitfinex is kinda pokey about processing withdrawals, and LakeBTC... just how the heck does their "Lakebankers" thing work anyway? 
Meanwhile, keep working on those account verifications for every exchange out there. You live in the wrong state? Whoops, cross that exchange off the list. (Maybe you can get around it with your corporate account?) 
TL/DR: Go ahead and try. But don't say I didn't warn you, it really is a lot of work.

Many of the NYA supporters have refused to implement Segwit in their services/exchanges, keeping pressure on the fee market as an underhanded way to make it look like Segwit can't get the job done without a larger blocksize.

BTC has been rising at a clip of around 0.7% per day for the last year. So while a dip could come at any time, most likely if you wait you'll just find the price another 5% higher next week, and the week after, and so on. So just buy in.

Blockstream is one small company with only a few devs amongst the entire core development community. Despite the constant propaganda the simple fact is they have only a sliver of influence on Bitcoin development.
TX fees are partly a function of capacity and partly a function of demand. If you want low fees go use Dogecoin or a thousand other alts with ample capacity and low demand. But supporting and promoting the fudstorm propaganda factory that is BCH, that's beyond the pale.

Alts got pretty severely deflated in the weeks leading up to this point, so now they are just reinflating. They still have a ways to go on the whole.
I do expect institutional investors to be moving back in now that the uncertainty of the fork is gone, but that will take a little time and not be a sudden rush.

A purchase on GDAX does not involve a blockchain TX so it is recorded immediately in their centralized ledgers. 
Your statement is confusing because trading between cryptocurrencies within the Bittrex exchange is also internal to their site and does not involve a blockchain TX. I assume you are talking about sending some coins to Bittrex? That is what would take a blockchain TX and will take some time.

There is no good reason. Big blockers have BCH rendering the B2X fork pointless.

Good, every time some naysayer cries "But tulips!" the price rises again.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:53:47
It's all relative. Up until about a year ago fees were just a few pennies, if even that. Then we started seeing spam attacks to clog the mempool and growing usage as the price began rising, until people were paying a couple dollars in fees. If you are moving $100,000 worth that is still nothing, but for people just trying to move $10 that gets annoying fast.
Then add in the fact that fee estimation tools tend to do a bad job. You can set your own fee with most wallets using information like  (striking a balance between how fast you need the TX to get confirmed and how much you pay). But many people just let the wallet set a default fee, which tends to run too high. That's why lately you have people complaining about $7 fees while others are boasting at the same time of getting TX through with a $0.15 fee - the former people are simply overpaying for the most part.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:49:00
Latency is more of an issue with larger blocks than just the storage costs. 
And there are a host of problems with the NYA effort itself, which are not criticisms of increased block size itself but are relevant objections to the upcoming hard fork. Such as the fact that they are rolling back to older code (from 0.15 to 0.14) that lacks a long list of bug fixes and optimizations. Which makes the notion that B2X is an "upgrade" pretty dubious.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:03:05
Really I fault Customs for asking a poorly worded question (as can be seen from the other answers people are giving here). This breaks down into a distinction between "carrying" currency and "having access" to your funds (whether bitcoin or anything else you could potentially access digitally). They need to look at their own intentions and then at the reality of modern finance and do a better job of phrasing the question.

B2X has no chance. It's a version downgrade (0.15 to 0.14) with no dev support, weakening miner and business support, users hate it and the futures market is down to 13% of BTC and weaking.

It did cause a temporary sharp decrease in the trading price. The entire market dropped about 5% right when the news broke. 
But then everyone read the news and it said the Tether team was pushing out a patch that would basically immobilize the stolen funds, making them worthless. Now they will either claw them back or simply issue new tether to replace what was stolen. So it's literally a non-issue. Once the market realized that it quickly recovered about 80% of the losses. It was all over in 2-3 hours.

I don't think there is anything in the tax bill relating to Bitcoin, which is already subject to capital gains tax.

Usually when a coin pumps strongly it is based on some technical advance or major adoption or partnership being announced (like Stellar doubling overnight a few weeks ago on an IBM/bank partnership project). This BCH pump is based on nothing. The only "news" is them getting rid of the EDA, which is nice and gets them out of a hole they dug but in no way advances their coin in adoption or usability. So this is a clear pump-and-dump. 
The purpose of every altcoin pump-and-dump is the same: to rope in newbies and rubes (run-of-the-mill big blockers in this case), so the whales running the operation can profit at their expense. The newbs/rubes buy in higher after the whales bought in low and are pumping it in social media. 
Then the whales dump on the newbs and rubes. The newbs and rubes are left holding expensive BCH and instant and growing losses while the whales have lots more bitcoin. It's played out so many times its ridiculous, but lately there are so many newbies, and the rubes want so much to believe in their backwards minercoin, that this will be immensely profitable for the  operators.

It differs by exchange. For example on HitBTC you can't split your BTC, you can only buy B2X tokens (which is nuts in my opinion). How they are providing these tokens is a bit of a mystery. 
On Bitfinex you can split your BTC in BT1 and BT2 tokens. BT1 = Bitcoin and BT2 = B2X. You can then sell the BT2 tokens for USDT or BTC (and then you can split the BTC earned and do it all over again for several cycles). Once the fork occurs the tokens convert into coins on each chain. This is what I've done. (Note that Bitfinex is closed to U.S. customers as of Nov. 9).

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:45:28
Suggested fees by wallets are invariably too high unless you are in a rush. That's why I suggest looking over the distribution in the mempool at a site like 
The size of the TX is based on the number of inputs. It sounds like you have quite a few, resulting in high fees. Basically every transaction you send has to reference where you got the bitcoin you are sending. It's a lot shorter to say "Send $10 of the $20 I got from Alice" than to say "Send $10, with $1 that I got from Alice, and $1 from Bob, and $1 from Carol, and $1 from Derek..."
So try to avoid having lots of small inputs into your wallet. If that happens you can pick quiet periods when the mempool is empty and send a low-fee TX that empties out your wallet, but sends to a new address within your same wallet. Then in the future you'll have much lower fees.
Keep in mind we have fee pressure here because of the delays in Segwit adoption. Most miners blocked it for a year based on FUD and lies to prevent off-chain scaling and try to maintain control. Now they are trying to entice people to their own scamcoin where they maintain complete control and a monopoly on TX fees.

It's not the amount you want to send that is causing the high fee, but the amount of inputs involved. If you received bitcoin in lots of small amounts, sending bitcoin means referencing all those small payments when your wallet compiles the outbound transaction. That makes the TX size larger, increasing the fee.
To combat this and minimize fees requires some planning. When I realized I was sitting on hundreds of dust (small input) transactions about six months ago, I decided to wait until a lull in transaction activity, and then completely empty the wallet by sending it to a new address in the same wallet. At the time Electrum was giving me insane fee estimates (a large fraction of a bitcoin), so I hung tight and waited. 
I was able to make the transaction during the lull right on the eve of August 1 at an excellent rate (total was something like 0.004 instead of a ~100X higher). It took patience and planning, but once done I could transact for minimal fees again. I suggest others with many small inputs try a similar strategy of waiting for a lull and then being ready with a minimal TX fee. Now with RBF it's not risky to try lowballing it and then bumping the fee up if t looks stuck.

There are many good arguments. One fundamental one relates to how BCH is controlled:
You can also try pointing out just why Bitcoin has a scaling problem in the first place: It was the bad actors behind BCH who held up Segwit with lies and FUD for a year. Without that we'd have a high level of Segwi adoption by now and LN would have been under development longer.

That's not even remotely true. I've increased my "bitcoin equivalent" 150% this year holding and trading in alts - and that's despite cashing out 10% of my portfolio in May (with no new investment of consequence). I'm not that skilled a trader, I've just held other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Stellar and Nxt in preference to Bitcoin for much of the year at the right times.
Most major cryptocurrencies have their own use cases now and are becoming increasingly dissociated from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:51:03
You are better off visiting altcoin mining forums and configuring your own system. (Mining for Bitcoin is done with ASICs not CPU/GPU systems).  Keep in mind that what typically makes a good altcoin miner is a cheap-as-possible system, except for having adequate RAM, a strong power supply or two, and as many GPU's as you have PCI slots (without exceeding your power supply and building circuit limits).
Such a system isn't good for anything other than mining so you can't typically buy something off-the-shelf for mining from a retail outlet. Of course people advertise mining systems, but in my experience (now dated, I mined thru 2014) they add a hefty profit margin so you're better off just building your own system.
Best wishes with it. It's a good way to get neck deep into crypto and learn a lot very fast.

This comes up about 5 times a day here. Here's the fix:
1. Log into GDAX.com (same login credentials as Coinbase).
2. Hit Deposit and move your Bitcoin from Coinbase to GDAX. This is free and instant since it is all internal to Coinbase operations.
3. Then hit Withdraw. GDAX pays the miners' TX fee for withdrawals from GDAX, so this is free to you. You can withdraw to your personal wallet or whatever.

It will take time to adjust on coin.dance/blocks.
ViaBTC said in a Coindesk article the other day that they are not offering the option of mining B2X initially, despite being a NYA signaler. And BTC.top said they'd mine the most profitable fork. Taking those statements at face value NYA is only a little above 50% now.

I'm pretty comfortable with tether personally. No other (major) cryptocurrency offers the kind of stability you'd  want to "secure" gains, besides cashing out to your preferred fiat currency.

This fork is completely different in that it is a contentious hardfork in which one side is trying to destroy the other so there is only 1 surviving chain. That's why the NYA team did not put any kind of replay protection in place. I think it's unlikely the losing fork will survive with any kind of value at all for long, so it's not like the more peaceful previous forks where people perceived (wrong in my opinion) that they were getting "free money."
(I say this is wrong because the supporters of BCH, for example, were not new people who had never bought bitcoin. They were a splinter of the existing Bitcoin community who left. They simply transfered their economic support to the new coin. Since Bitcoin was growing strongly and new people kept coming in the loss was not noticeable, but logically it still had an impact.)
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:35:07
That can (and I expect will) be addressed by 3rd parties offering simplicity, security and hand-holding for a fee. Bitcoiners to date are a self-reliant lot, but as things go more mainstream I expect we'll see more rather than fewer wallet services that offer that all-important 1-800 number to call when people screw up, or lose their password, etc.
This will involve things like multi-sig and time-locked transactions that allow for some clawbacking, and merchants will learn to adapt to it. And we won't like it, but so long as its voluntary I doubt there's much to be done about it. It will be the price of mainstream adoption.

Just buy bitcoin on an exchange.
If you really want to try mining, forget bitcoin (it's an industrial-scale ecosystem now) but build a mining rig for other cryptocurrencies. It's a very good way to get yourself neck deep into it so you can learn a lot about all aspects of cryptocurrency. (Unfortunately it's been a few years since I did this so I don't have any handy guides or much in the way or links to get started.)

Well, now I understand another reason of why some miners hate Bitcoin. The letter explains that Replace-by-Fee is incompatible with 0-confirmation techniques that could have been used for "instant" Bitcoin transactions.
For Bitcoin this should not be a problem down the road since such everyday transactions will be handled offchain by techniques like the Lightning Network. But that means the miners don't get any transaction fees from us every time we buy coffee. No wonder they hate it.

The only way a person can lose their Bitcoins is if they pretend that B2X coins have value and send them off to another party. If a user is foolish enough to be scammed into buying something with their B2X coins the scammer will have a shot at stealing their Bitcoin. (I expect scammers to come out of the woodwork to try just this). But the bottom line is you only get burned if you are trying to use B2X coin. Why should Bitcoin devs try to protect people who are effectively undermining or attacking Bitcoin as part of the NYA attack? Let them get burned.

With all of them you might earn 1 penny a week worth in Bitcoin trying to mine it. (I'm serious). So don't waste your time. Just buy what you can afford on an exchange.

It has no future.
It failed because it had incompetent devs using an incompetent process.
It was bad because it was an attempt to place Bitcoin under the control of a mining/business cartel rather than the whole user and development community, and the change itself would have a centralizing effect from increased node costs. 
It was only a stopgap solution that would not allow for the massive scaling we need for mainstream adoption, and as such was a distraction and impediment to more important projects like the Lightning Network.

 You're drunk on lies.
LN is not a side chain. Segwit is completely independent of sidechains, so you are spouting random nonsense.
You're also conflating two completely different forms of consensus. The miners maintain consensus mining bitcoin according to the agreed upon protocol. But contrary to the big blocker cultists it was never Satoshi's vision to enslave us to a mining cartel that would simply replace central banks in managing and controlling our money. The minute they chose to seize control by refusing to implement changes agreed upon by the rest of the community is the minute Bitcoin became dangerously broken. It's the minute we lost Satoshi's vision.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:14:09
The blocks are not limited to 1 MB, as you can see by glancing at them:
(Scroll to bottom, look at Size and Weight columns)
So this is another big blocker lie. They've successfully kept segwit adoption low, which is keeping the actual block sizes fairly low at just over 1 MB on average. But they are growing and will continue to grow as people are able to convert over to using SW addresses. This saves people fees themselves since their TX are smaller, and saves everyone else fees by reducing fee pressure.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:04
I think we'll see widespread use of escrow agents as Bitcoin comes more into use as a currency. For example, I can see a Bitcoin marketplace sort of like Ebay springing up, where merchants who want to participate have to go through a trial period where all purchases go through the marketplace administration's own escrow service (paying a fee to do so). Only after sufficient positive feedback was built up could they accept payments directly, and if their feedback/reputation started dropping they might be required to go back to using an escrow agent as a condition for remaining in the marketplace.
This would provide protection for consumers and incentivize merchants to provide good service and keep people happy.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:07:02
Good article. I'm of the same mind on these points. As a flagship I want Bitcoi to first and foremost be a secure store of value. It can serve a role as cash using second-order solutions, but without the foundational layer of a strong store of value the cash layer would be inherently unstable and prone to systemic shocks. 
I'm hopeful, for example, that derivatives will reduce BTC volatility, which is a necessary precondition for widespread use as a currency.

You don't understand the difference between influence and power. If a majority of miners decide to mine B2X and kill Bitcoin, that's power.

It's just a question of finding a fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange or other method that will work for you. I don't think I've ever been asked my age when signing up, just for bank account or credit card information. So if you have either you should be able to sign up, no problem.
And you don't need to limit yourself to an exchange. Localbitcoins.com provides peer-to-peer buying and selling. If you can buy something on Amazon you can purchase items for other people using Purse.io and get paid back in Bitcoin.

Joseph's line was relevant to Jews for legal purposes, and thus was the lineage that Matthew focused on in his gospel oriented towards Jews. Luke was gentile-oriented, and gave the royal and physical lineage. I think  has a reasonable take on the matter.
Yes, I am saying it is unreasonable to claim that Jewish and Christian writers over the course of centuries were supposedly editing the Bible to suit their tastes, as constantly alleged by critics, without addressing starkly obvious difficulties. Things like this, or the use of a plural grammar for God in Genesis 1:1 (which makes good sense in light of the Trinity but must have seemed all wrong to Jews for centuries), serve as a testimony to the contrary.

Block 494784. Since we don't know how quickly blocks will be mined we can only estimate. It's less than 2160 blocks out now so it should be less then 14 days, probably significantly so unless hashrate shifts dramatically. (There is an anomaly I'm trying to understand on that point, but no point in speculating yet.)
My best guess is Nov. 13, or maybe 14. Bashco has a clock at  that should converge towards the actual time as it gets closer. Keep in mind the BCH EDA is still making a mess of things on occasion, throwing all such estimates off.

I would agree that altcoin mining is a better idea than Bitcoin mining. If you seriously want to make a go of it I'd max out the number of GPU's rather than using just one. 
That's what I did. To learn as much as I could as fast as I could when I got started in crypto in Jan. 2014 I built a mining rig with four R9 290X's and mined for a year. So I definitely recommend it as a learning tool.

Question: Section 3.6 states that a selfish user is incentivized to avoid unnecessary TX on the main blockchain because they would share in the higher resulting costs. But what about an "attacker" (a operative on behalf of fiat currency or an altcoin, for example)? An attacker might be willing to incur the financial costs if they caused much greater costs throughout the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Has this been analyzed in any detail? What steps could be taken to mitigate this?
I have in mind a "vandal" or "spammer" who deliberately enters into many level 2 arrangements and then repeatedly crashes them by broadcasting to the blockchain. 
EDIT: The last sentence of the paper speaks to this: "Nevertheless this risk limits the usefulness of large groups."

You mean Bitfinex, or Garzik &amp; the NYA folks fixing the code? The latter may not happen as there is no incentive for them at this point. And Bitfinex could reasonably say that so long as there is a chance of someone forking with NYA code before December 31 they have to wait on converting the BT1 tokens. 
So whomever has futures tokens may be stuck until the December 31 expiration, unless someone besides Garzik is motivated to fix the code and then mine a fork. That was a risk I recognized when I bought into the BT1 tokens.

The December 31 futures expiration is from the Bitfinex Terms and Conditions (TOC) for the NYA hardfork futures market: 
(see sections 1.5 and 1.6)
Roger Ver wagered 250 Bitcoins/B2X coins each with several high profile bitcoiners, with the stipulation that the B2X fork had to achieve 100 blocks past the fork for the wager to be activated. See 
So if someone does launch B2X and it somehow manages to reach 100 blocks mined but remains basically unvalued, Ver is out millions of $ worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:23:55
The article has a couple minor errors:
1. You can't split BTC to sell B2X futures tokens on HitBTC, you can only buy them there.
2. The article states B2X is an upgrade to 2 Mb. blocks. That's incorrect since max blocksize is now based on weight, and could be up to 4 Mb. with the current chain and 8 Mb. under B2.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:53:19
Uhh, no. Consensus has been in favor of Segwit and against bigger blocks for a long time. That's why Bitcoin now has Segwit and no block size increase.

For those confused by Bitcoin's quick drop, let me point out that the altcoin markets deflated heavily as people bought Bitcoin ahead of the fork. I and many others expected a quick return to altcoins, and that is exactly what has been happening. It's nothing wrong with Bitcoin.

Yes, it's roughly a week. But there have been cases of someone thinking a TX got canceled, but some "helpful" node out there reintroduced the TX and it went thru (due to the lower fees over a week later) resulting in a "surprise" TX after they'd given up on it. So that's something to beware of.
Also keep in mind that there are Child Pays for Parent and Replace by Fee options that let you bump up the fee now from either end of the TX if it does get stuck. You can google those for more info or read the docs on your wallet to see if they support those functions.

B2X is the ticker for the fork being created by the NYA agreement, doubling max blocksize to 8 MB while retaining Segwit. It is also a downgrade from 0.15 to 0.14 version Bitcoin as it only had 1 part-time dev, so it is lacking bug fixes and optimizations. Futures markets still list it at around 14% the price of Bitcoin but without replay protection I don't expect it to survive long as people will be afraid to touch it. (One major backer, Roger Ver, will lose millions of $$ in wagered bitcoin if miners mine 100 blocks of B2X without it becoming dominant, so I expect him to exert pressure to kill it off by lobbying miners not to mine it.)

Yeah, basically. When Bitcoin Cash was born as an ideological splinter group and retained some value people perceived it as "free money." (In reality I think it just carved value from Bitcoin so it didn't create any value at all. This is because the BCH supporters were previously Bitcoin holders, not people new to crypto, so Bitcoin lost their support the minute BCH gained it.)
With Bitcoin Gold it is happening again on a more modest scale, because BTG doesn't really have any decent support group to speak of, just traders speculating on it. But it's enough to attract scammers looking to push more "Bitcoin look-alike" forks in the hopes of dumping pre-mined coins (like BTG is doing) for a quick fortune.
We've seen all this before when altcoins first arose. And copycats are not new - when Blackcoin was released and enjoyed some modest success, within weeks there was a coin named for every color you can think of, almost all of which were just pointless scamcoins. It was ridiculous.
It will be up to exchanges to squash this, since their support is needed to do a successful fork. If the exchanges refuse to hand out coins from a fork or create markets to trade it, the forks will wither and die. It's a fair bit of trouble for the exchanges and creates risk if replay protection is not done right, so after the NYA fork I think the mood among exchanges will be "No more forks, not for a long time and only for very good reason."

It is very prudent. The fork can still cause a lot of mayhem due to the lack of replay protection.

One problem: The miners are slitting their own throats. Destroying the investments of hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin users will create an army of embittered opponents who are used to evangelizing and (thanks to the scaling wars) fighting against centralized opponents. 
So the miners wind up with most all the BCH and pump it to high prices while BTC gets slaughtered. Then what? Are we all going to become slaves and lackeys of Fake Satoshi, Jihan Wu and Bitcoin Judas? Not likely.
Investors will be running scared from the crypto space. With additional BCH entering the market (either held in reserve in case it rose, or from Xapo/GBTC/Coinbase/etc.) their price will start sliding. Core will finally do a PoW change, and no need to wait since there's no longer any qualms about bricking malicious miners' equipment. 
Bitcoin slowly gets a rebirth - I won't pretend it will be easy. But it will have development that we can relentlessly point to, while the relatively small band of Bitcoin Cash users runs out of buyers for overpriced BCH and the coin begins retracing. It won't be long before they are panic selling. If Jihan Wu wants to wind up owning 100% of it, he can be my guest. Let him find buyers for his crap coin then while he goes bankrupt mining it.
Keep in mind that Bitcoin Cash is objectively the worst coin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin has it beat on fees and speed after all. It doesn't have smart contracts, it doesn't have anonymity. It's a rollback from the optimizations and bug fixes Core has been steadily introducing. At some point reality will set in, so just hang in there.

If you think a 50-60% crash is bad you are fairly new to Bitcoin. Or are you thinking that the new leveraging will help reduce the volatility fairly dramatically so that's as bad as it would get before buyers stepped in?
We've seen flash crashes in crypto from cascading margin calls that have wiped out order books entirely (for example the Coinbase Ethereum crash to $0.10 a few months ago). So newbies should beware, but veterans should not be surprised by any of this.

Which just means miners will be able to afford to buy more of them to mine the exact same amount of Bitcoin. 
For a Bitcoin price of P, the amount of money spent by miners on hardware, electricity and operations will always approach P for every bitcoin mined. Given operational costs (cost of buildings, employees, etc.) is a small piece of the pie, it boils down to how much the hardware costs relative to the electrical usage. 
You can reduce electrical incrementally by inventing expensive hardware that eats up more of miners profits, but the miners will only pay for it if the tradeoff is worthwhile. I'm not saying you cannot cut electricity consumption, but I expect the effect to be very marginal.

I don't like the forks, but insofar as part of the community split off to support them, that value would have been retained with Bitcoin if there had been no split, and so I'd expect the value of 1 unforked BTC to be roughly equal to 1 BTC + 1 BCH + 1 BTG. 
Besides, someone relying on his chart who hodl'd 1 BTC from 2014 would indeed have 1 BTC, 1 BTG and 1 BCH, so he'd have over $10K in value at this point. That it's technically split between 3 blockchains shouldn't dampen their pleasure at such an achievement.

I don't know enough on the technical side to say what's required to implement this. It could be a soft fork or it might require a hard fork, or maybe nothing at all.

Bitcoin futures markets (Bitfinex) give BT1 a value 84% that of Bitcoin. That's driven by the users. By contrast 84% of blocks are mined by NYA supporters (Segwit2X), a direct opposite of the user preference. (See coin.dance/blocks)

You might need to be patient, but at some point traders are going to look into diversifying or rebalancing and putting some of their profits into the beaten-down alts. Plus I've noticed that a number of incoming investment funds are talking about holding baskets of crypto, not just bitcoin. That should be good for the Top 10/20/30 altcoins. 
I've noticed Stellar is back down to barely being above where it was before the big IBM/banking transfer news a few weeks ago. Litecoin is what, just barely 1/2 of its ATH? And it is superior to Bitcoin Cash as a low-fee cash alternative to Bitcoin, having faster blocks, Segwit, LN development and the potential for atomic swaps. Not every alt is beaten down, but many are going to catch fire and soar at some point.

1. You'll have to ask Coinbase. Of course it takes weeks for them to reply, so..... sorry.
2. Starting price. We already have futures markets for B2X, so just look them up on exchanges like Bitfinex. B2X tokens are running around 15% of the price of Bitcoin.
3. B2X is trying to kill off Bitcoin, explicitly. The price of Bitcoin goes to 0 if B2X is successful. But since there is no reason for us to trust or invest in a centralized coin like B2X (we already have Ripple), there's no reason to think the price will rise from where it is now. Personally you'll find me in Litecoin if Bitcoin is destroyed.
4. Yes. Expect volatility if the fork is not quickly resolved.
5. Selling your coins is not the problem. _Moving_ them is the problem. If you have coins on an exchange you should be fine selling or buying them since the accounting for that is all internal to the exchange. 
The risk is with Replay Attacks. Since the chains have a common history and the NYA attackers have chosen to have zero replay protection any transaction broadcast on one chain initially will be just as valid on the other chain. So if you send someone 10 B2X, the same transaction will also send them 10 BTC on the Bitcoin chain if it leaks across nodes (or the recipient simply puts the transaction into the Bitcoin mempool). This can be prevented if you are an expert user.... but a lot of people won't know this.
6. Can't tell you what to do... personally.... I've sold a portion and am using them to hedge against a worst-case scenario.
7. It all depends on the miners and how centralized/unified they are. They can't make us value B2X, but they can destroy the Bitcoin blockchain with empty-block mining if they remain unified. I think this would ultimately lead to an emergency PoW change on Bitcoin, but the damage to Bitcoin's price might be massive. ("Trans-Goxian Event" is the term I've invented for this.)

You don't understand the mining process. GPU's are perfectly capable of mining and are in no way a bottleneck to TX capacity (which has nothing to do with hashrate). There will be 10 minute blocks either way, just as there were before 2013. GPU's just don't produce as many hashes as an ASIC for a specific algorithm, but that is compensated for with difficulty adjustments.
Bitcoin did not "upgrade" to ASICs. ASICs were designed to mine bitcoin because it was profitable, and in so doing led to inevitable and massive centralization of the mining process. 
This has been a problem. This is a problem. And this will continue to be a problem until it becomes disastrously so, even more than it already is. 
The problem with BTG is not GPUs but with the fact that it is just an opportunistic scamcoin by a couple no-name devs done without any consensus. I believe Bitcoin should transition away from ASIC based mining, but this should be done by consensus and competently supported by most or all of the development community.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:38:42
Up til the BTG snapshot (Oct. 23-24) I'd say yes. For some reason the % of Segwit TX nosedived at that point and hasn't recovered as of a few days ago. Not sure why.
A big part of the problem is that many of the very companies that complain we need bigger blocks have refused to implement Segwit in their wallets/exchanges/services. Segwit would give them bigger blocks (up to the 4 MB limit) but also reduce fees and undermine their argument that even bigger blocks are needed. Hopefully after the NYA fork fails they'll enable Segwit.

I've used it dozens of times without issue. You can cancel an order any time. You can restrict your buyers to only Prime members and go with a 5% discount to ensure immediate service (though I bet you could go twice that with little or no delay; I always go 15% off or higher). You can return items for exchange or a credit. (When I did so I got a higher price than I originally paid, since you get the highest price it's been listed at rather than the actual price since it was a gift).

The futures markets (there are at least 3 or 4 now) have all been very stable with B2X at 15% of the price of Bitcoin. (Every time some whale tries to drive the price up or down it reverts back, it's weird). You can check out the futures markets at Bitfinex and HitBTC, for example.
Miners are still signalling around 82% support, but ViaBTC is one of those signalling and yet they are saying they won't even offer miners the option of mining B2X when it forks.

Short term: Increasing Segwit adoption, which is still quite low. The next release of the Core client should make it easier to use Segwit by default, I believe. Some of this is out of the developers hands (ie., cajoling wallet and service providers to enable SW TX and make them default options. We can help by making our voices heard to businesses dragging their feet.)
Mid-term(?) Advances like Schnorr signatures and MAST should provide some further help, at least incrementally.
Long term: Lightning network and supporting layers to enable global off-chain scaling.

Blender... has been FUDDing against LN for a while. I suggest not further feeding the ant-BTC trolls.
They are filled with reasons why LN can't work, just like they were so certain Segwit would fail. The fact that devs are working hard to make this work rather than make it fail, and that users will use it in an efficient rather than inefficient manner, totally escapes them.

To clear up some confusion: BTC1 is the github repository for the NYA fork effort. So yes, NYA is signalling for that fork.
It is not to be confused with exchanges labeling. For example Bitfinex is listing BT1 as the futures token for current bitcoin and BT2 for the NYA coin. Other exchanges might be using the nomenclature BTC1 for current bitcoin and BTC2 for the NYA bitcoin, so it can get confusing.

Whatever you do, have backups. I would not consider a single paper copy in a safe deposit box adequately safe because I'd worry too much about something, over the course of my lifetime, happening to it. Even in a bank vault.
The trezor, if I recall correctly, should have a seed that you can use to recover funds with if and when the trezor is ever damaged/lost. Store that in a couple safe places (obscurely labeled so someone who happens upon it won't know the significance of it, but something that you or your loved ones will recall). Or you can get fancy and split the seed or paper wallet into multiple sections with multiple copies, so someone who finds any one of them can't do anything.

Well, one problem is that since these are futures markets every exchange has its own terms and conditions defining exactly how it is handling the tokens for B2X and Bitcoin. That's one reason why they can't be transferable. 
Imagine for example if one exchange specified that the fork had to happen at the exact published block height for the B2X fork, and that any fork at any other block height would not count as the B2X fork. Then imagine a coding or deployment issue leads to the NYA team delaying things for a week. If tokens were transferable it would result in traders gaming the system in such a circumstance, leaving one exchange or another holding the bag.

This is a wild guess based on coins that have never moved. But there's no telling how many are truly lost and how many are simply HODL'd. We simply don't know if Satoshi's fabled million coins are lost or if the keys are simply being kept secure for future use, for example.
As the article notes, future losses are going to be very low. Most losses will date from the earliest years of mining before they became worth a great deal.

On the contrary it is very sober, and the men who wrote it lived out its teachings and died for it. As have many of us since. 
Do you also claim Josephus's writings can be similarly dismissed, since he wrote in the same place and time? Do you see how silly this is?

Prevention of scaling was caused by miners refusing to incorporate consensus improvements for over a year. It is covered in the bottom section, Preventing Necessary Upgrades From Being Implemented.

So as I understand it:
1. Some bank stole $850 million from Bitfinex and tells them the feds seized it. Bitfinex says BS but can't do anything about getting the money back (why?)
2. So they decide to quietly use Tether reserves to cover their losses. Ironically this sort of proves the reserves were real, or at least a substantial portion of them.
3. So the NYAG catches on and calls them out on it, with the excuse that NY residents are trading on Bitfinex so they can get involved. (I think that excuse is flimsy - I had US personal and LLC accounts on Bitfinex myself that were shut down because of my US residency. I doubt Bitfinex was knowingly letting NY residents stay on.)
Have I more or less got it right? If so, a pox on thieving banks, a pox on Bitfinex for the ill-conceived cover-up attempt, and a pox on the NYAG for not relaying information to the proper authorities for action. Depressing all around.

A couple reasons:
1. They've had their share of bugs/hacks. Not lately, but it doesn't inspire confidence. Fortunately white hat hackers (google "Johoe") have done a good job stealing BTC from their users faster than the black hats.
2. It's just a bad idea in general to give your bitcoins to someone else and leave them vulnerable to hacking online. (Think Mt. Gox, or Allcrypt, or Mintpal, or Cryptsy, or Cryptorush, or any of the other depressing list of hacked wallets and exchanges online.) It's one thing for convenience to have a small spending account online, but why wouldn't you secure the vast majority of your funds offline like on the Trezor?

Careful. A free market will always win out in the end. But there is a real question of how "free" markets are in crypto. There is a lot of manipulation. 
We should not trust core. We should expect them to make their case in an open and free market (trying to break up any manipulation of the market), and let the chips fall where they may. If they are doing the best job (and I agree they are, by a huge margin), they get to keep their role.

It was a lightbulb moment for me when I realized that investing in Bitcoin was more like investing in a tech company stock then a fixed asset like gold. When you invest in a company you are giving money to people who are motivated and working hard to make more money; with Bitcoin you are investing in an ecosystem with thousands of developers and businesses trying to make it all more valuable.

You're right, it's basically for day trading. So you lend for margin traders. Only a few exchanges offer it. The upside is you can earn some interest. The downside:
1. You're leaving your coins on an exchange, and we all know the risks there.
2. While exchanges try to protect lenders, a bad crash (similar to the Coinbase Ethereum flash crash, though no customer lenders were involved there) could wipe out collateral and leave borrowers unable to pay back lenders.
3. When your coins are out on loan you have no control over them and can't trade with them. So if you trade much you should not use trading coins for lending or I guarantee you'll find yourself desperate to buy/sell based on an opportunity, and won't be able to because your coins are loaned out. (You can set a loan duration of 2-30 or 60 days, but then the borrower decides how long within that timeframe before they close out the position and repay you.)
So basically I wouldn't bother unless you can get very good rates (like at least 10% annualized) after the lending and bot fees. And I've noticed that when rates spike up it's often a sign a coin has spiked up and it's the right time to be selling it, not holding on to lend it.

I was wondering when they were going to release my ACH funds. This does not look good.
I was sitting at my computer last Monday plotting which stock/ETF investments I'd be selling to pour back into crypto once Bitcoin hit my trigger point of $4300. And so I got to watch it spike through my price target in a matter of minutes on that $1000 jump while I beat my head against the monitor. 
Of course I got my sell orders in that night, since I was (barely) ready. Now it's a week later and I've just barely begun moving funds into crypto. Despite using wire transfers (after the first ACH transfer I wised up) it's like watching molasses crawl across a slight incline. Not to mention all the wire fees and phone call checks to allow the electrons to move to the next stage.
All of which is to say, the fiat world looks ludicrous compared to the speed and efficiency of cryptocurrency. This next bull run is going to be awesome as the average investor begins to get in and realize how much better it is.

Liberal scholars talk about a "Q" proto-document from which 3 of the Gospels were derived. I don't believe there was ever a literal document equivalent to Q, but I do tend to believe that "Q" conceptually existed in the form of shared conversations, letters and other communications between the authors.
In any event all this conjecture ignores the declaration of II Tim 3:16 that all Scripture is "inspired" (literally "God-breathed") - and thus not subject to human forgetfulness.

Depends. If the fork is resolved quickly there will be a surge of buyers. But if things get ugly and drawn out the price will turn negative in a very volatile way as waves of buyers get overwhelmed by panicking newbies selling out belatedly. If the news cycle is negative and miners stay 51% or more with the NYA some buyers will be scared off and the rest will be guessing as to when it is best to get back in.

Anyone who puts any money into BCH is basically playing with fire. Not just risking losses in a pump and dump, but encouraging the notion that Bitcoin can be replaced with a centralized, miner-controlled scamcoin with no real consequences to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. That has the potential to burn the entire cryptocurrency market down in a Mt. Gox-like event if BCH "won" the market cap competition. 
Then we'd be treated to daily headlines in crypto and general media about the lovely leadership of Ver, Wu and Wright and all their plans for the things they want to do to us poor unenlightened cryptocurrency users. Don't play with this fire. Just don't. There are literally a thousand other cryptocurrencies to trade with and speculate in without the toxicity and risk associated with BCH.

That's not to say it's all saints and roses here, but the difference is after you wash away the crud here there's something left, whereas in months of reading (and compiling helpful links on various topics) I get virtually nothing from the BCH apologetics once I clear away the FUD.

It "makes sense" that the NSA would have taken an interest in IDing Satoshi at some point (the idea that they've studiously ignored the whole subject seems difficult to swallow). So this story appears credible. Unfortunately it's also just a story, with no sources or evidence to corroborate it.

Unfortunately there is no way to arbitrage since you are using non-transferable futures tokens specific to each exchange. HitBTC has been flaky on the subject of big blocker fork activity since this spring, I wouldn't trust them or their numbers.

@_date: 2017-11-08 15:48:16
Once B2X fails the NYA parties will have no excuses to delay implementing Segwit in their own exchanges and services. That will help keep fees down as segwit adoption increases. In the meantime learn to set your own fee based on fee market data.

Anyone already can afford mining equipment. That's not the issue. Economies of scale with low cost power is a bigger problem for anyone wanting to mine profitably. But the other side of the problem is that ASICs cost a fair bit to design and manufacture, and centralization is inevitable on that side.
The only solution is PoW changes to destroy the risk of ASIC mining by keeping it to GPU/CPU mining. To me this is a boringly obvious prediction/prophecy. It's just a question of how long this drags out before the obvious solution is implemented.

There are already futures markets at exchanges like Bitfinex and HitBTC. The Bitfinex price of B2X is around .13 BTC at the moment. It's all market-based.
A lot of people perceive these forks as "free money" but I don't see how that can be the case unless they were somehow attracting new people into crypto. Since that doesn't seem to be the case it's fair to say that any forks that attract significant support are taking that that community and their purchasing power away from Bitcoin. 
I expect such an effect to be temporary in the case of the B2X hardfork though, since I do not expect it to survive. Then it is just a question of whether the losers are so bent out of shape that they drop out of Bitcoin entirely.
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:28:45
OK, I'm going to take a stab at this myself. A few weeks ago on Bitcointalk I described a government model in which a coin would pay out funds (in addition to the mining reward) to a dev group. The payout would be variable, each miner being able to set the number of coins created with each block they mined that would go to the dev group, within a fixed range.
The miners would be incentivized to fund the dev group adequately to keep the coin innovating and healthy, but would also be incentivized to not fund it too lavishly as that would dilute the value of their mined coins. (The block payout to the dev group would be independent of the normal mining block payout). 
Further, competing dev groups could arise, such that the community would vote (based on # of coins held) for which dev group they prefer, based on public keys submitted by each dev team. The most popular team would receive the payouts from the miners. Thus in the case of obvious corruption or poor performance the community could cut off one team in favor of a new one.
As far as that proposal went it did not address how to cajole miners into implementing updates provided by the  elected dev team. That could lead to the same situation we have now - Dev team puts forth Segwit, miners reject it, community votes to keep dev team, but miners do what they want. How to fix this?
I propose that the elected dev team have the ability to restrict miners' payouts in some fashion, based on code placed in the protocol from the start. Payouts to recalcitrant miners could be delayed, reduced or otherwise restricted. This would  keep the miners accountable to the elected dev team, itself accountable to the community. 
What I'm getting at is a system of checks and balances, with the democratic expression of the community as the ultimate power. It needs refining, but hopefully this inspires others to carry the idea forward. Because what we have is not going to work much longer.

It is if your fee is too low. Or if blocks are slow - 10 minutes is just average, which means sometimes we go an hour with no new block.

When I get involved with bitcoin at the start of 2014 my understanding is that fees were a pittance. Now they are running around 1-2 BTC/block is my understanding. Assuming some continued growth in adoption, even if TX congestion drops off  the fees should be sufficient to maintain a substantial mining effort. 
I think decentralization is by far the more pressing issue on this point, compared with the level of rewards or hashpower. A cryptocurrency secured by a million graphing calculators is safer than one secured by a handful of massive ASIC farms if the latter becomes dominated by a cartel.

I didn't realize he was the one who put that forward.

It's a project by Jihan Wu and Roger Ver to monopolize bitcoin mining, and by extension mining fees, by maintaining their covert use of ASICBoost. (The whole point of BU is to block Segwit, which fixes an exploit they are using to gain advantage over other miners). 
When Litecoin began signalling for Segwit, they attacked it as well to try to prevent people from seeing that it is safe and works as intended. They are basically trying to prevent Bitcoin from moving forward with offchain solutions like SW/LN by forcing everyone to keep paying miners fees while they use their edge in mining to drive out the competition. The frustrating thing is that it looks to be working quite effectively.

And those were even earlier when Bitcoin was volatile and basically useless outside Silk Road. There's far too much investor interest now buying in on every dip. 
Not saying it can't have a crash that would be savage by normal stock market standards, but it will take some pretty huge events. No exchange dominates like Gox once did so a exchange hack wouldn't do it, and we've seen what happened when China shut down its exchanges (ie., not much). The fork was the last big risk that I saw potentially causing chaos but that looks like a dim possibility now.

You will need to wait for the transaction to be logged in a block with several blocks built atop it - I think Electrum uses 3 confirmations.

Here's an even better approach:
After you get your funds on Coinbase, transfer the $$ to GDAX and place a limit order right at the current buy/sell price. Hopefully it will be taken in moments. Why do this? Because limit orders are free - no fee at all. Then withdraw to your wallet, which is also completely free. Since ACH transfers are free too this means you can do the entire cycle from bank to Bitcoins in your wallet without spending one satoshi.

People who run computers to secure a blockchain, collecting transactions and adding them in blocks to the blockchain ledger. In return they receive payouts of the coin being mined when they successfully solve the puzzle to add each block. The computers may be normal systems with powerful GPU's, or specialized ASICs, depending on the algorithms used for each cryptocurrency. In the latter case it is generally an industrial-scale enterprise, as hobbyist miners cannot compete with warehouses full of ASICs in locations where they can get free/cheap electricity.

Careful - I would not buy Amazon gift cards through Purse.io.  ~2 years ago I did about a dozen times, all with different people on the other end of the Purse transaction, for amounts ranging from $25-200. Things went well for a while, then suddenly one day Amazon cancelled EVERYTHING without warning.
Didn't even send me a notification of any kind so I had to discover it on my own. I contacted Amazon several times, got nowhere. Started a big long thread on Bitcointalk about it, and made sure Amazon knew about that too. 
Ultimately it was Purse.io itself that came through and refunded me the BTC. Which was really awesome of them, but left me with a very sour taste in my mouth towards Amazon. Amazon never explained themselves or lifted a finger in any useful way. I still use Purse with them, but I would never trust an Amazon gift card after they decided to steal $650 from me, over gift cards I provably had paid for in every case.

Keep in mind there will be 3 more halvings before 2030. The price is not governed by the electricity consumed but rather the opposite: Mining will tend to expand or contract based on the value of the bitcoins being mined.
Since only 1/8 as many bitcoins will be getting mined in 2030 compared to today the amount of electricity needed will be equivalent to what would be used today if the price of bitcoin was around $62,500. Which is a lot - 50X as much as right now. But not enough to melt ice caps.

Decentralization could be enforced by Core updating the PoW algorithm such that it would go back to CPU and/or GPU mining. This could be done with a long enough timeframe to allow the current mining industry to ROI (say 12+ months). 
Core could further make it clear that it would change the algorithm again and again as necessary to prevent specialized hardware from being used to centralize mining. (It would be a hassle, but I'd go so far as to _plan_ to change the algorithm or other aspects of the protocol on a somewhat frequent basis, to prevent a covert implementation of ASICs from hijacking mining.)
This might not totally prevent centralization or level the playing field. People with cheaper electricity would still have an advantage, and people could still build mining farms of CPU's and GPU's. But it would help widen the based of people who could be involved. A million hobbyist miners could offset the mining farms that today are unchallenged.

OK, so if your goal is not to promote drug use, then I don't really understand what you are doing. What do you hope to accomplish?
Let's say you get virtually all of us to agree that Bitcoin should not be used to buy drugs. (I agree with that statement, BTW). Do you have a BIP submitted that will somehow put "Thou shalt not buy drugs with Bitcoin" in the protocol? How would that even work exactly? Do you understand the absurdity here? You can't ban Bitcoin from being used to buy drugs any more than you can ban using it to buy milk or Cheetos or a car.
Now, as far as your efforts to increase drug use go: People use drugs largely as an escape mechanism from stress and abuse in their life. When you go around abusing people you are thus part of the problem, driving people to drugs/alcohol rather than away.
I'll give an example of what does work. When I was a young man I was elected to my church council, which my father was already on. We had called a new pastor, who turned out to be a smoker. At one of the council meetings someone mentioned it, and he mumbled something about the science not really being settled about the health impact of smoking.
That was too much for my father, a quiet man who's own father had died from smoking-induced throat cancer when I was a toddler. And he was a professor who taught health and human anatomy at a major university. And so with earnest conviction he told the pastor that he was wrong, and that the evidence was clear, and he laid out for him right there. Not abusing or sneering at him or treating him like a fool, but making a case based on both science and personal conviction. 
And you know what? Whatever cigarette that pastor had before the meeting, was the last cigarette he ever had.

If bitcoin is unable to scale because of the current impasse, it does not mean it will die. It does mean it will be throttled and lose potential growth. 
Currently bitcoin can best be described as "digital gold" - that is, a store of value - rather than online cash or optimized for privacy or smart contracts or any of the other things alts are working on. That's a very valid niche, and it doesn't require high transaction volumes. So I think it has more growth potential than some may think.
Don't get me wrong, I think it will be hobbled if there is no scaling solution. I just don't think it will be fatal in the short run. It could continue to grow in value for some years yet, though it's pre-eminence over other alts would gradually fade away until others matched its market cap. At that point if a viable competitor for the digital gold niche was available, I'd expect to see it fade.
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:55:24
1. It incentivizes miners to mine empty blocks. BU has been completely hypocritical about this, shrieking about high fees created by their own mining practices.
2. It is incompatible with SW/LN, so BU has been fighting progress tooth and nail and now we see why. Now it all makes sense why they've fought SW to the death despite being unable to marshal serious reasons when asked to justify their hostility.
3. It centralizes bitcoin mining. My understanding is that they didn't share this 30% advantage with their customers, at least not most of them. And it's such a huge advantage that it runs competition (such as KnC) into the ground, driving them out of business. BU/ASICBOOST was nothing less than a scheme to centralize all bitcoin mining under the monopoly control of Wu and his associates.
The thing is, what happens now? Something has to _make_ Bitmain stop holding this advantage. Until that happens this mess is still unfolding. It doesn't go away just because it has been exposed.
I didn't like the UASF when first proposed because it seemed radical and a bad precedent. But given the crisis if Bitmain can't be stopped in short order, to save the rest of the mining industry I'd favor the UASF as an emergency measure ASAP.
@_date: 2017-04-20 03:17:07
If his goal is blocking Segwit so he can keep using covert ASICBoost, then yes he has gotten his way.
If you had asked me a few months ago at what point I should panic when it comes to the centralization of mining hardware production and distribution, in my ignorance I would have suggested a level far below what Bitmain has already achieved. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:14:14
Ugh.... what this  all looks to me is that we have traded committees like the Federal Reserve Board and other central bank boards, for a board of miners. How exactly is that an improvement?
At least the central bank boards have a publicly stated goal of acting for the public good, and could be subject to political acts to be replaced if they ever strayed too obviously from that goal.
By contrast, who has the power to fire the mining cartels now forming? The only answer is the market as a whole, by dumping one coin for others. That will keep the miners from getting too obviously rapacious, but it leaves them a lot of leeway to rip off the public when a coin is doing well.
I wish I had something better to suggest rather than just vent my anxiety, but I don't. At least bankers are economically astute, with the miners in charge the question of basic competence regarding economic matters outside their enterprise becomes a serious issue. Be glad there are a lot of altcoins out there - we are going to need them, is my prediction. Hopefully some of them will come up with governance models that work better and are more accountable.

There are quantum resistant algorithms; at least one cryptocurrency's name says as much, I've noticed.
My understanding is Bitcoin has multiple levels of encryption such that QC's would not immediately break the overall security of Bitcoin so long as you don't reuse public keys.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:42:07
1. Miners earn fees from transactions as well as the block reward. So there is no point at which "it is no longer profitable to mine" so long as anyone is using it.
2. Bitcoin cannot be cracked. Even if the entire universe were composed of computers trying to crack it they would fail, so there's no concern that faster processors will be a problem in the future.
If you fail to follow best practices there is a possibility that someday in the future quantum computers could be invented that could crack a reused key, but that can be easily addressed in several ways. The algorithms can be updated to be more QC-resistant, and wallet software could be updated to more robustly discourage reuse of keys (which makes this attack vector possible), for example.

Congratulations on a nice problem to have.
$1.8 million is enough to retire on, if you invest it "reasonably" and live off the income. For example if you put it into a stock index fund that earned 8% (a reasonable expectation), that would net you $144,000/year. You'd want to reinvest at least 1/3 of that to counter the effects of inflation, but that still leaves over $90,000 to live on each year, which is more than you have now.
Such a plan isn't bulletproof, so if you like your work by all means keep at it. Even just a few years of further income will make a huge difference in how safe it is to retire. The biggest risk is that your investment tanks the minute you retire. This is a bigger risk in Bitcoin but also true for other investments.
That said, if you want to begin living off this fortune now I'd advise converting at least a portion of it to fairly stable investments - maybe 2-3 years of cash and another 3-5 years worth of mutual funds for example. That way you could ride out a recession or bitcoin crash without any immediate pain while waiting for things to recover. But it still lets you keep a lot invested in Bitcoin or other more aggressive investments like stocks. 
By all means if your wife wants to cut back, this would be a wonderful gift for her. But it would be to her own benefit and good for your marriage to work out what she'll do with herself with all the free time. Will she stay home and pick up more of the chores since you're still working? Focus on caring for your child(ren)? Talk things through so you both understand one another.
And yes, do tell her. There's a lot of awful advice here to hide things from your spouse. Some of it is understandable given people's experiences, but it is still terrible advice. You should be trying to make your marriage work, not plotting how to win if it fails. If you cultivate that mindset it likely will fail, and the money is trivial compared to the grief of a broken marriage, especially where kids are involved. A good marriage is something you need to work at - it does not come naturally. 
Given you mention being married three years, I'd suggest giving this some attention. You're past the honeymoon period, and into the point where strife can become a real problem. Work to build your marriage up and not tear it down.
You mention your wife is not tech savvy; what about interest or competency in investing? If she is then you'll want to talk about how to disposition your bitcoin windfall and agree on a plan together. If (as I'm guessing) she's not and doesn't feel up to the challenge, still keep her in the loop on what you are doing and the reasoning for doing it so she understands and can give her own feedback.
For example, she may well want to pay for a house outright. But if you explain that mortgages are very cheap and provide tax deductions, and that you are investing a larger amount than the mortgage in fairly conservative investments (corporate bonds, utility mutual funds, etc.), you can show how you come out ahead by having a mortgage. So long as she trusts you and understands (basically) what you're doing it will stress her less than if she feels she has to make decisions.
Also: Don't plan any big changes in your lifestyle! Take any "upgrades" slow. You'll be happier living within your means and then gradually getting luxuries you can justify than going nuts on an expensive lifestyle and then watching your investments crash. 
This will also be a key topic if your wife tends to spend without a budget. Learn to budget together if needed and agree together on spending on discretionary things, especially his/her toys that the other spouse might resent if they are not spending as much on themselves.
(Side note: It would be great to splurge just a little to celebrate - say by taking a special vacation or even just treating her to a very nice night out - and that's where you can share the news of the 200 BTC.)
TL/DR: Communicate, communicate, communicate. Don't hide things. You'll be surprised how much it helps to talk through and get her input, even if she's not "sophisticated" about bitcoin or investing. Make this a blessing for your marriage, not a curse. And be willing to accommodate her concerns and hopes with your own planning on how to handle your BTC.)

Sounds like someone somewhere re-inserted your TX to the mempool and this time it confirmed. That can happen accidently or due to some node trying to be "helpful." 
As to why you are not seeing it on the receiving end I have no idea. But it cannot be redirected - if you sent it to "X" originally, then it went to "X" whether any services are seeing it correctly or not. I'd recheck your GDAX and Coinbase accounts (if you have more than one is it possible you checked the wrong one(s)?) Since you say you got an email from Coinbase about it they must be seeing it, so it may just be a glitch in getting it to appear correctly on your account.

Bitcoin mining has rather short ROI's and so I'd propose that Core (that is, everyone) start looking at a plan to transition away from ASIC-based mining back to a CPU/GPU based paradigm over a timescale of several years. That would allow the current mining industry to ROI and wrap up with a profit while escaping this centralization trap.

But it seems like the only choices today are failed states, dictatorships, and plantation-states.

Problem is, they are already easily available - aren't they? That's how you and your friends got them. So if drugs are widely available now under the "War on Drugs", what are you really accomplishing?
I didn't say I was in favor of doing drugs. To clarify/emphasize, I'm against it, leading by personal example as mentioned. There's just terribly little evidence that drugs are being meaningfully restricted presently, and what it would take to do so would be a draconian police state that would be a nightmare to live under. So I encourage you to rethink your approach to the subject, because the costs of the "War on drugs" are vast, for virtually zero benefit.

Yes, this. 
1. Every bitcoin holder has been swindled by BU driving the price of bitcoin down with their attacks and obfuscation.
2. Every other miner has been robbed by Bitmain's covert advantage skewing the hashrate projection, and through use of ASICBoost.
3. Every bitcoin user has been shortchanged by BU's blocking of SW and the LN so they can keep building up their monopoly at the expense of mainstream adoption capacity. Not to mention paying extra fees due to TX congestion while Bitmain mined empty blocks.
This isn't BU versus Core. This is BitMain, Ver, and their stooges ripping all of us off.

If necessary, if the Chinese are so corrupt they won't lift a finger, I'd support Core taking steps to make their hardware incompatible with mining BTC.

This (or this period rather) is, hopefully, the "capitulation event" that marks the bottom of a bear market - a final sell-off that shakes out anyone who is not a hard-core HODLer. 
It last happened, IIRC, in Feb. 2015 after Bitcoin went from over $1000 to the low 200's for a while, then crashed down to under $180 before spiking right back up into the 200's. It then bounced around in the low 200's for another 6 months, but the spike down marked the bottom of the bear market, and we began moving up from there.
My advice: This is the worst time to sell. Good time to be buying if you have the funds. And just hang in there.

ASICBoost is a technique for mining more efficiently (something on the order of ~20%, which is huge if margins are thin). There has been a lot of controversy over allegations that Bitmain has been using a form known as covert ASICBoost that is difficult to detect, in their own mining operations. Their hardware was built for ASICBoost, but they did not enable it for customers. That and some quirky behavior (mining empty blocks and championing their right to do so at a time when fees were skyrocketing due to congestion) led to suspicion they were rigging the mining game to their own advantage. 
Noteworthy is that covert ASICBoost was incompatible with Segwit, and Bitmain was fiercely opposed to Segwit, holding up the critical scaling technology (and thus the Lightning Network) for months for reasons difficult to understand if they weren't using covert ASICBoost. They split off and created Bcash (which retains covert ASICBoost as an option so they could presumably continue milking their cash cow) when it became clear they couldn't stop Bitcoin from scaling with Segwit/LN.
Overt ASICBoost is now leveling the playing field as other miners take advantage and do so above board and transparently.

Sorry, but it's silly to imagine that the last 9 years will be undone and the universe of cryptocurrencies will just vanish into a puff of smoke. Bitcoin maximalism is as silly as nocoiner rubbish, and for very similar reasons.
Bitcoin is and can remain the pre-eminent store of value. But as a 1st-generation coin attempts to scale it are... complicated. Compare something like Nano to Bitcoin with a fully-developed LN and you'll see what I mean. 
Likewise, Bitcoin is not going to knock Ethereum or Stellar  or Monero etc. out of their niches, or even challenge them in their niches. Each of those is drawing new people into cryptocurrency, benefiting Bitcoin as well. If all we had was bitcoin we'd have a smaller pool of interested users and adoption/grown would suffer accordingly.
Yes, you can point to scams that are rife among altcoins. Scams are rife within the bitcoin ecosystem as well if you hadn't noticed. And just as the nocoiner emphasis on those scams is not a reasonable assessment of Bitcoin, it's not a reasonable way to view the entire crypto universe either.

No, he was surprised by it. But then he turned out right that there would be a capitulation, so he was just being premature in thinking 6K might be the bottom.
He had another conference call today (to reassure panicky investors no doubt) and he expected that while BTC may drop further and test 5K, overall he was thinking this is signaling the end of the bear market and that we'd see a rebound soon due to some upcoming news (ICE exchange or something like that opening in December). He surprised me by saying he guessed BTC would be in the ballpark of $8-9K at the end of the year.

Many government currencies have died in my lifetime, and there is no reason to suppose that will stop.

Being a superpower has nothing to do with it. That's just handwaving. The OP has given some good reasons not to trust in government currency, as have I. Look at the absence of a response besides insults and vulgarity and dismissal. 
That's why crypto is going to win. We have the arguments on our side. It doesn't matter whether I state them or not, or whether you believe them or not. Government currency will go to zero because politicians always find it easier to overspend rather than raise someone's taxes, until the debt load is unsustainable and no one will loan money to them. At that point the money printing accelerates. Cryptocurrency is free from this failure mode, which makes all the difference in the world.

Ma'am, you are being judgmental, and not sharing truth.
Cryptocurrency offers many good things, along with the misuse of it. It frees us from the manipulation of government-issued currency, which is readily deflated (causing everyone holding it to lose in favor of debtors who win when currency is inflated). It is also more efficient, eliminates fees and middlemen and waste in economic systems. 
While it can provide criminals an ability to move funds, it can do the same for dissidents such as Christians in countries where they face great persecution and close scrutiny of their fiat accounts. I volunteer with Voice of the Martyrs and keep encouraging them to use cryptocurrency where appropriate. The Foundation I started to fund Christian work in other countries is funded entirely with cryptocurrency, I might add.
Jesus has sent us to share the good news with people everywhere - that though they are slaves to sin and cannot stand before a holy and just God, they are forgiven if they repent and accept Christ's payment for their sins. It is not for us to judge the hearts or motives of men, but God alone.

We've gone through this before. I was listening to a investment manager a week or two ago say how weird it was that crypto was bottoming out quietly rather than with a capitulation event like we did in early 2015 last time. Well, it looks like we're having our capitulation event after all. 
If the stress is too much, just stop watching the numbers for a while. Recognize that crypto isn't just going to evaporate. When I got into crypto in 2014 I spent the first year asking "Am I missing something? Why does it keep falling?" And the answer was never that something was fundamentally broken. All the advantages and promises of crypto were intact. So I kept investing and sure enough it all turned around. HODL on.

Let me get this straight. You would prefer to hold dollars that are subject to inflation and have lost 95%+ of their value in the last century, rather than invest in Bitcoin that has gone from zero to thousands of dollars in nine years.
Have I got that straight?
You are completely missing/glossing over the fatal flaw of government-issued currency. Politicians are always finding ways to spend money, and it is always easier to run a deficit than to raise taxes and anger someone today. So governments run up huge debts that become manageable only by printing excess money to create inflation, reducing the value of the debt they hold (and stiffing the people who are owed that money). 
Sooner or later this gets out of hand, and people realize they are never going to be repaid if they make loans to the government (or will lose on the deal due to inflation). That leads to a hyperinflationary death spiral. It's happened many times before and will keep happening because of the basic dynamic outlined above. Human nature is not going to suddenly change.
Decentralized cryptocurrency is free from this fatal flaw. There is no one who has power and is motivated to print extra bitcoins to cause inflation. All the other issues you mention pale in comparison to that simple point.
Yes there are bugs, and the LN is not ready for prime time yet, and payment systems are not mature and so forth. All that can and will be fixed. But that's secondary stuff in relation to the core value proposition for Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies: They are scarce.
That's what this boils down to. Bitcoin is scarce, and it is secure. No government issued fiat can credibly say the same. And the next time we have a financial crisis and they run the printing presses the whole world will be reminded of it.
@_date: 2018-03-12 00:27:02
Lightning Network works as a 2nd layer built atop the existing infrastructure (blockchain). You can't remove the blockchain because that _is_ Bitcoin; LN just rides on it.
It might be conceivable to re-engineer Bitcoin into something different (like a DAG) without losing anything, but the complexity, risk and difficulty of doing so is unfathomable. If LN works it will take enough pressure off the blockchain itself to make it unnecessary to take such a radical step.

If it can break through it will "confirm" to the TA-voodoo folks that Bitcoin has broken out of the "descending channel" from 20K to 6K and is now in a confirmed bull run.

No. There are hundreds of possible financial niches to exploit. Bitcoin will only be optimized for one. If it tries to be a jack of all trades it will be out-competed by specialists in each niche it tries to cover. (Though I do think there will be some "utility coins" that cover a mix of niches in a mediocre fashion, I do not expect them to dominate.)
The long term trend has been for BTC's market share of cryptocurrency to drop. I expect that will continue as crypto matures.

Anyone with a significant amount of crypto owes it to their loved ones to figure out how they will be able to access your crypto funds if you get hit by a truck tomorrow.
In my case I gave one set of relatives information in a password protected file that would enable them to access the funds. Another relative has the password. You can develop more elaborate schemes (such as putting the file in a safe deposit box rather than in someone's hands, and covering it in your will) as appropriate to your situation.

Just to add a bit to what others have said - your old address will still work if someone sends bitcoin to you. So it's not like you need to worry about funds disappearing into a black hole. But address reuse is frowned upon so the exchange is doing you a favor buy giving you fresh addresses to use each time.

No, the risk is in staying entirely in dollars or other government currency while it deflates to nothing. 
There's always been the risk of a government currency being mismanaged to oblivion and every so often it happens. But part of what has propped them up is the lack of any real alternative. The next big bull run in crypto will come at a time when the Lightning Network is maturing and other highly scalable cryptos like Nano and Stellar will be fleshing out their own payments gateways.
I predict some of the weaker government currencies are going to come under severe stress as their citizens discover that crypto is more of a real alternative than ever. Whether they collapse in the next bull run, or survive (telling themselves crypto is all just a fad, no doubt) until the NEXT bull run arrives like a tsunami, I can't say. But if you look at the crypto charts, the next 2-3 bull runs promise to be monsters in terms of economic impact. And once government currencies start collapsing in the face of it hyperbitcoinization becomes a real possibility, and with it a permanent, high, plateau as Bitcoin settles into a dominant role.

I used to think this way too (and I agree with what you are saying). Money or gold just sits around, while investments in a company earn a return.
But then it occurred to me that when you invest in a cryptocurrency you are investing in a project that has developers working, typically very hard, to make it a success. When you buy a bitcoin you are buying into a project that has thousands of devs in many different organizations, all trying to make it a success. And typically they are far more motivated than an employee in a regular company, which translates into faster and further progress.
That was a light bulb moment for me when it came to investing in cryptocurrencies. And it has panned out as expected.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:04:23
You are conflating several things. Regulations, if done well, are a positive for cryptocurrency given the level of scams and criminal activity up until now. Governments regulating crypto with an eye towards protecting users and investors is a good thing, and is not banning cryptocurrency. 
As far as banning it goes, that's basically impossible. Between satellite blockchain downloads and radio mesh networks it is not plausible to prevent people from transacting on the blockchain. Heck, I could mail a postcard with a TX to a node operator if push came to shove.

It was reasonable to Bitcoin price to drop a bit on the understanding that a significant chunk of the global bitcoin buying community might lose their access to Bitcoin exchanges.
However, over time I expect even the most draconian attempts by China to ban bitcoin to leak like a large-holed sieve. Because even if they strictly censor and block Bitcoin websites from being accessible in China, nothing can stop Chinese citizens visiting nearby countries (Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, even Hong Kong) from buying/selling bitcoin while they are in their hotels there. "Bitcoin tourism" trips could become commonplace under such a ban, and I doubt the Chinese government could do much about it without closing their borders.
There are also innovations like the Blockstream satellite system to consider, not to mention encrypted messaging apps being used for OTC trading, and decentralized exchanges. The satellite in particular provides an end run around the Great Firewall of China, and similar developments could further empower Bitcoin users in China despite the best efforts of the Chinese government.

In general I'm learning to dread being out of the market because it's so easy to miss Bitcoin's upward moves. But I understand the sentiment fully and think it's prudent for the next month. Just keep a very close eye on how things are going because the moment some clarity occurs the market will begin moving sharply up. 
In fact, a sharp upward movement may presage the announcement of the NYA being abandoned as insiders take advantage prior to public announcement. That unfortunately is how things work in the crypto space, absent insider trading controls.

Well, it will help promote the development of anonymous decentralized exchanges, which would be a good thing. And while it will make it harder for Chinese to buy, it will also make it harder for them to sell their BTC. So I think the price impact will be mildly negative for a short while, but not long term.
Judging from the ICO news it makes tremendously more sense that a such "ban" would be temporary, basically a chance to increase regulatory oversight before allowing the exchanges to reopen. A solid and permanent ban would probably impair the Chinese mining industry, which is really shooting themselves in the foot.

I'm going to take an optimistic view here (at least for this post!): So far it is possible to interpret all of the Chinese government's actions at face value, as being a crackdown on criminal activity (unlawful capital flight, money laundering, illegal dark web purchases and the like) and dangerous, wild speculation by investors. Maybe clumsy, maybe ineffective, and maybe collateral-damaging-inducing, but just maybe that is all they are trying to accomplish, and after a strong regulatory framework is set up they will reopen the doors for cryptocurrency.
For example, it's possible that they first tried to get a handle on the situation months ago when they closed the exchanges and asked them to improve KYC/AML efforts. But they may have discovered that the measures taken by the exchanges were inadequate, and that criminals already grandfathered into the system were not rooted out.
In this case surgery might be required: Totally shut down the exchanges, close down all accounts. And only then do a restart - allow the exchanges to reopen, but with everyone applying for fresh accounts under stronger regulatory controls. 
The coming days and weeks should hopefully clarify whether this is the right interpretation of China's policy on cryptocurrency or not. Either they will continue cracking down in ways that are plainly hostile to the very _idea_ of non-government cryptocurrency, or we'll see new regulations released and a policy set forth on how cryptocurrency will be tolerated and under what conditions by the regime in Beijing.

There was an article I saw yesterday about how Isaac Newton threw his fortune away after watching a stock he'd sold early rise higher, until he could no longer stand it and bought back in. Right before it finally crashed. The risk is if you wait you might watch the price rise until it drives you nuts, and then you buy in at the worst time. So just buy in (or dollar-cost average over time), and hodl.

Personally I'd like to see many cryptocurrencies, optimized for every financial niche (and creating many new ones). And in general a world of highly optimized cryptocurrencies means that they will be specialized, not fulfilling multiple roles.
Bitcoin was originally envisioned as a cash replacement, but it has instead adopted the role of a store of value - digital gold. And I think that is the best role for the flagship cryptocurrency to have. 
I'm glad for the LN and Segwit and other improvements, but there are some inherent contradictions between being a store of value and being a convenient cash replacement, relating to the velocity of money and security. For that reason I believe it is a mistake to make it try to fill both roles. 
If you look at some of the newer architectures like Nano, I don't think Bitcoin would really be able to compete with them long term anyway. LN is great, but it's complex and complicated and not free. Nano, being free, scalable and as fast as LN and dedicated to the cash replacement role, would serve that role better. 
Let Bitcoin be digital gold. And if people want to pay with it, great. I just doubt it will ultimately win on both roles, and trying to do so may lead to mediocrity and defeat if choices favoring one role or another lead to unacceptable compromises. Just my 2 satoshis.

So it's big. It's a huge profit to anyone who buys OTC below the market price. So it will be bid up to the market price. 
Remember the Silk Road auction? Anyone remember what those coins went for compared to the market? My recollection is that based on failed bids it had to be over market value. If anyone today wanted to buy a large amount of BTC without massage slippage this would be an excellent opportunity.

Think it through OP. You can run the printing presses at the mint, announce tomorrow that everyone's job has been cancelled and that henceforth the government will pay them $1000/hour to dig ditches. So everyone goes and digs ditches and is rolling in money. The economics report shows wild economic growth and zero unemployment. An economic paradise!

It's easy to roll your eyes at this, but the immutable nature of a blockchain that is a great strength for some things is a real headache for others. 
Right now we have two alternatives: Open databases that can be edited by anyone with access, and blockchains that are theoretically immutable. 
The latter is arguably great for things like cryptocurrency, not so great for a huge range of business functions where the open database model is a problem, but so is the inability to fix errors. 
There's a reason why practically every decent sized company out there staffs help desks with people fielding internal and external complaints that they have to go in and fix manually. I don't know how many times I've rolled my eyes at some Ethereum-based ICO project and the "Code is law" mantra with this in mind. Code is law only works if you've got things _perfect_ - and that's not very often with most complex systems. 
So laugh if you want, but I suspect there will be a quite a few applications where this is invaluable. And I'll agree that we need to be vigilant that this doesn't creep into applications like decentralized cryptocurrency where it isn't wanted.

I don't fully agree. If a government keeps running large deficits there comes a point when it cannot pay its debts regardless of how rosy the economy looks. So I think people who imagine hyperinflation can't happen because they live in a prosperous country have a blind spot. 
If the central bank were willing to let the government financially implode, yes, the currency could survive. But I don't think that's realistic given their track record, and the fears statists have about such a situation. I think they'd try to save it like they did in 2008 as the lender of last resort to a government no one else is willing to loan money to. That would involve a lot of money printing. I know they talk about being able to shut it off, but in a bad situation it wouldn't be that simple. There's no magic way a government can erase monstrous debts (and interest payments) without either draconian confiscation of wealth or a severe impact to the currency.

Of course, you also discover that your coins are loaned out right when you really want to trade them for some reason. In addition to the risks mentioned above that's also a big annoyance with lending.

What do you mean "in what country"? The laws of economics don't stop at borders. The principles involved are universal.
Dismissing something ("paranoia") doesn't make it go away. The $1.3T deficit with the latest US budget deficit, for example, works out to $4,000 in added debt for every person in the U.S. That's $24K for my family in added debt for just one year. In my regular middle class job before I retired I didn't make enough over expenses to take on that much additional debt, nor do the vast majority of other people. These are unsustainable trajectories - unless the printing presses are run and the markets flooded with dollars at some point to reduce the value of the debt held by government. Once that starts and people lose faith in that currency it's hard to stop the stampede to the exits, hence the hyperinflationary death spiral.
It's no good saying some government currencies are "sound." That just means they haven't died yet. But look at their deficits to judge their health, not the fact that they haven't died yet.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:50:01
I do mean exactly hyperinflation. There is too much money printing going on to prop up government spending, and at some point things are going to come unglued with that. It will start as an uptick in inflation, but "with other things to worry about" that seem more pressing. No one wants hyperinflation, but once things go too far down that path it's extremely painful to stop. I don't see the US government or culture being willing to do what is needed to fix their problems.
Ironically, the USD can collapse now precisely because we have alternatives that we did not have in the past. Which means people who understand what is happening will have alternatives like Bitcoin to shift their wealth into. Yes it will be bad, but it will be the worst for those clinging to unbacked government currencies to the bitter end. 
It's been a long time since the US debt was mostly held by citizens. Do you really think the average American has anywhere near (Edit) $64,000 in T-Bills? That's $384,000 for my family's share if we are average. And that's just the federal debt. (

This is old recycled FUD. Peter Todd pointed out that the links are all dead. And accessing the illegal images requires a great deal of knowledge in how to extract the data and recreate an image file in order to get it to display. In other words, there is absolutely no chance of anyone accessing the objectionable content by accident. None whatsoever. 
By contrast, would you give a six year old child a smartphone for an hour and certify that they cannot get into something as bad from random clicking on links? Of course you can't be confident that this would not happen. 
In other words, anyone who thinks this is a problem for Bitcoin should IMMEDIATELY throw their phone in the river, take a sledgehammer to all their computers and insist that everyone else must do the same. Because you are literally infinitely more likely to access child porn (etc) with a standard web browser than you are with Bitcoin.

But let's say he did die soon after backing away from Bitcoin. If that's the case his keys could still be out there, hidden away on some old flash drive or hard drive sitting in a cardboard box inherited by some completely unaware relative. Odds are the box would ultimately be disposed without any thought to the contents, and they might be unrecoverable after a few decades in the back of a garage anyway.

No, the sort of leadership I'm talking about here is not market-based but power-based. If they succeed (by whatever means) in enforcing their will in defining the Bitcoin protocol then they have achieved a leadership position and will be correspondingly vulnerable in the manner I describe. 
I don't know how you arrived at your claim that they represent any kind of majority. How do you quantitatively do that? Have you assigned a value to every explicitly NO2X company, the neutral ones, and the remaining NYA supporters? 
Moreover, why should bitcoin be defined and controlled by businesses that exist to make money off users of it? That's a model sure to turn it into a cash cow for the benefit of the businesses at the expense of users. We already have such a system with government currency and banks.

I do find it odd that so many people think of bitcoin as being a replacement for gold in their investment fund. They are wildly different in their potential and risks.
The only thing they really share is their separation from government-issued fiat currency, which would protect them from a hyperinflationary collapse. But in terms of risk/reward they are opposites:
Gold, over a medium to long term is an extremely low risk. It may spike up and then decline a bit on occasion, but its real world buying power is going to stay about the same just like it has for thousands of years. If 1 oz. of gold buys 1000 loaves of bread, you can be sure it will never drop to only buying 100 loaves of bread in your lifetime - but it will also never buy you 10,000 loaves of bread.
Bitcoin is the opposite. It faces manifold risks - competition from alts, government/central bank/institutional hostility, hackers and more. And if it survives all those and doesn't go to zero, it quite possibly can change the world and become a major economic player in years to come. Five years from now one bitcoin that currently buys you 3,000 loaves of bread might buy you 100,000 loaves of bread. Or it might buy you zero. But I'll be astonished if it is still worth right around 3,000 loaves of bread in five years.

A fair point, and in, say, the year 2100 that will be pretty effective since fees will be &gt;&gt; than block rewards at that point. But bitcoin may not last that long if miners for the next dozen years make a habit of not processing TX.
I suppose we could say that if they do this consistently it will kill off bitcoin, destroying the value of the coins they mine. So we have here a bad actor in a tragedy of the commons scenario: If all miners behave like Antpool then bitcoin dies. So Antpool is counting on all the other mining pools being good actors who process TX so the system (mostly) runs well. That gives Antpool the leeway to be the bad guy without killing the golden goose.
I guess I can just keep calling them jerks.

I largely agree with this. There are no firewalls between currencies, so network effect is crucial. I would add as a caveat that Bitcoin must avoid any fatal technical missteps (a serious bug that can be exploited, a lack of scaling, or seriously longer confirmation times compared to competition, for example). If it is _seriously_ technically impaired compared to rivals then the rival with the greatest network effect and no fatal flaws would tend to replace it. For lesser flaws I would expect the network effect to overcome the limitations.

Once you split your BTC, the BT1 tokens represent the core BTC chain (current BTC), and the BT2 tokens represent the NYA's B2X hardfork.
1. So if the fork doesn't happen, BT1 becomes BTC and BT2 becomes worthless. (Bitfinex will have to make a determination of when to let the BT1 become BTC again and kill off BT2 - best to read the fine print on this in their T&amp;C.)
2. If the fork happens BT1 tokens become BTC and the BT2 tokens become the B2X coin. And then they can be traded or meet whatever fate awaits each of those chains.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:26
People are betting that the price will fall, and have borrowed BTC and sold it that they will have to buy back later to cover  what they've borrowed.
If the price drops to less than what they paid for it they win. But if the price rises instead they lose. If we push the price higher some of them will start getting nervous and start buying Bitcoin to limit their losses, which will drive the price higher, which will force more of them to buy Bitcoin before it gets worse, which will drive it higher, and so on until they've all capitulated and bought Bitcoin to cover their short positions.

I'll second this. There is a steep learning curve, and the best training is hands on. When I started at the beginning of 2014 I built a mining rig and mined altcoins largely to throw myself in neck deep and try to understand everything from the ground up. You can become competent in cryptocurrency without being a miner, but it's not as simple as getting into mutual funds and stocks, or even into puts and calls and options and margin trading. 
You want to start without a lot of stress so you don't start making stupid or disastrous mistakes when you do want to make more aggressive moves on a larger scale. Start playing around with it now.

HitBTC is charging $100 for a tether withdrawal, and Cryptopia was charging $40 for the same. And HitBTC also has heft deposit fees. So it's not just BTC. 
Obviously this is all way more than is needed to pay the miner TX. I suppose this is one way the exchanges are compensating for the low trading fees they have. For example Binance is only charging 0.03% right now if you use Binance coins to pay. They have to get their revenue somehow, the competition between the exchanges will force them to keep fees at reasonable levels in the long run.

Mining profitability constantly trends towards towards 0 for the most efficient miners because, as you point out, if there's profit to be made from mining people will just mine instead of buying. (Actually most people do not mine under ideal conditions and are at risk of losing money if the price does not keep moving up). 
But at any rate the price and value of bitcoin is not driven by the cost to mine a bitcoin. It is 100% the other way around. If Bitcoin crashes to $1, miners will drop out until it costs $1 to mine a bitcoin. And if the price goes to $1 million, miners will add hardware until it costs $1 million to mine a bitcoin.
The value of bitcoin is based on demand for it. We'd rather own an asset with a strictly fixed supply over government currency that is constantly diminishing in value (and inflation will be picking up in coming months, forecasters are saying). We'd rather have a currency that cannot be counterfeited, and that will soon be cheaper and faster to transact with than ever. $50,000 for Bitcoin will seem desperately cheap to later adopters in a few years as government currencies crumble before the competition.

They would be impossible to recover. The wallet is basically a tool enabling you to make a transaction entry on the bitcoin blockchain sending bitcoins you have received to another address. Without the wallet's private key any bitcoins sent to you just remain stuck at the last blockchain entry, unspendable by anyone.

Everyone will have the same coins on both forks, like BTG. But the similarities end there. 
Futures markets show B2X at a price of about .15 BTC. However this will not be a "free dividend" because this is a contentious fork, and the explicit intention is to destroy the minority fork. They've deliberately left out any form of replay protection, making movement of any coins on either blockchain risky if you don't know exactly what you are doing. As a result, one chain or the other should die a fairly quick death. (If not, I expect the continued conflict to be bad for Bitcoin, unlike the BCH fork.)

Coin.Dance shows the level of support and opposition for a hardfork to double the max blocksize of Bitcoin. This was the 2nd part of an agreement (the NYA), the first part being the implementation of Segwit. 
Problem is most of us don't want the blocksize doubled. It's unnecessary with Segwit already providing adequate near term scaling, and off-chain scaling is better to maintain decentralization and low fees. The hardfork is thus being pushed by miners (who earn fees from on-chain transactions), but opposed by users and devs. Businesses involved with bitcoin are split, though most of the "pro" camp appears to be under the control or influence of those who brokered the NYA. This implies most businesses with freedom to choose are against it.
No new businesses have come out in support of the hardfork for months to the best of my knowledge, while a small but significant stream of NYA signers have been backing out lately.

It's basic economics. Any "whale" (wealthy investor) can buy up a scarce resource and force the price to rise. So long as they don't put it back on the market for sale the remainder of the market has to fight over the remaining units of the resource. This causes the price to rise. 
Oversimplified example: If 5 people want 5 oranges, but a whale comes along and buys 3 oranges, then the 5 people bid up the price on the remaining 2 oranges until 3 of the people drop out of the bidding and only the last two get an orange.

Definitely against the NYA, because the members who signed it were never given authority over Bitcoin. It would be disastrous to allow such a precedent of a self-appointed faction dictating the terms of the Bitcoin protocol. 
As far as block size goes, it's the worst way to scale bitcoin due to increased latency, bloating of the blockchain, and resulting increased node costs and centralization tendency. As such it threatens Bitcoins censorship resistance and overall security.
If there were no other solutions it might be better than nothing, but with Segwit and off-chain solutions there's just no point in a blocksize increase at this point. Note that it has been pretty well established that the spikes in fees in the past have been due to malicious spam attacks by Bitmain's mining network, not real world use.

There are different phases. If you think Bitcoin was good in 2017, you missed the boat. I was up 7000% by being mostly in altcoins from March onwards, compared to 1400% for those who stuck to Bitcoin.

This is as good a write-up for confused/newbie questions as anything else I've seen. Though personally I'd tone down the rhetoric about the developers.

My take: The bottom will be when the bad news is done. There will be attempted corrections, but they will be knee-capped by more bad news as additional exchanges close. It's hard to believe the market will start pumping on news confirming OKcoin, Huobi, etc. are being shut down, for example. Once the closures actually happen, and if nothing terrible is happening on the SW2X side, we may see a real rally. Before that I'd say it's risky to jump back in prematurely.

Jihan (who controls Antpool) is a jerk. See:
The whole point of having miners is for them to process transactions. Mining is not meant to be a welfare system for geeks. So taking the block reward and not doing anything useful for the bitcoin ecosystem, while "allowed", is parasitic and counterproductive.

The TX are quick, it's just a question of confirmations to "bake in" the transaction to prevent a double-spend. That typically takes ~3 blocks before the recipient is confident the blockchain won't be reorg'd and the TX disappear because of malice on your part. 
Which is really only relevant to you if you are trying to go out and re-spend coins you just received. If someone sent you a bitcoin just now for example, and you immediately tried to pay for lunch with it at a restaurant accepting bitcoins, they'd probably catch on that you're trying to spend an unconfirmed bitcoin (if your wallet even let you make the TX), and object. (But if you had other older bitcoin in your wallet then the wallet should automatically use that bitcoin for the outbound TX, so the restaurant would be fine.)
Regarding  bitcoin is set to create 1 block every 10 minutes on average. If more miners join the network the higher hashrate will yield faster blocks for a while. But every 2016 blocks (14 days, nominally) the network looks back at the actual pace and readjusts the difficulty to get back to 10 minute blocks. 
China has about 2/3 of mining hashrate, so if that suddenly went offline after a difficulty adjustment the remaining miners would only get blocks every ~30 minutes instead of ~10. If nothing else changes we'd continue to see 30 minute blocks for the next 2016 blocks, which would be 6 weeks at 30 minutes/block. At that point the network would reassess the difficulty (up to maximum adjustment of 4X I believe) and things would get back to normal.
EDIT: I should also mention that the Lightning Network is coming soon, and will provide instant confirmations with minimal fees compared to on-chain TX. That will be a game-changer, and it is already active on Litecoin and Vertcoin.

No problem. A lot has been happening over the past year, so it's easy to get confused if you aren't following it literally daily. You're conflating the debates of about 6 months ago with what is currently happening. There is overlap in those debates but the specific proposals being advanced each have their own terminology.
BTU was shorthand for the coin advocated by the "Big Block" Bitcoin Unlimited faction, which does not exist any more under that name. I've no doubt many of the key people in BU are in the NYA agreement pushing for the "2X" half of the Segwit2X agreement, but no one has referred to the 2X hardfork as BTU. B2X  seems to be the accepted nomenclature for it.

So far I've noticed exactly zero articles in either mainstream or crypto media explaining just how contentious the Nov. hardfork could get. I suppose no one wants to spark a panic, but if nothing substantial changes between now and the fork things could get ugly. 
It will depend heavily on just how centralized the mining hashpower is under Ver and Wu's effective control. If it is then they have the power to virtually destroy Bitcoin in their hubris. (Granted I expect the Core devs could pull off an emergency PoW change or something of the sort if the main chain is completely dominated by hostile NYA empty-block mining, but the price will have cratered before BTC rises like a phoenix in that scenario, I believe.)

If you read the article it's asking people to get him the help he needs before he ruins himself. Nothing wrong with trying to help someone.

One of the problems with crypto's wild-west atmosphere is that there is surely a ton of insider-trading going on.

1. The 7 day transaction time is due to the time required for your fiat funds to wend their way through antiquated bank clearinghouse channels so Coinbase knows they've got your money, before they release your bitcoin to you. The bitcoin purchase confirms almost instantly by comparison.
2. Yes, that kind of transaction time for fiat currencies is unsustainable against the speed of cryptocurrency transfers.
3. If a sudden ban hits all of Chinese miners at the worst possible time we will see block times drop to around 30 minutes/block for a short time. At the worst case (no production of new miners anywhere in the world and zero smuggling/transfer of miners out of China, and no one turning back on old miners) this will resolve itself in 6 weeks.

So when will the 0.0008 fee be reduced on withdrawals? Even without segwit only a fraction of that is needed to ensure withdrawals go out on the next block ( 
And personally, I'd favor an exchange that has an option to withdraw at a very minimal few in exchange for the risk of having to wait a day or two. Sometimes it's just not a big rush and for small withdrawals being able to just do 1-5 sat/byte would make all the difference.

Most/all exchanges have set fees that rarely change, and are usually WAY higher than the fees charged to miners. So the only advice I can think of is to minimize the number of transactions by planning ahead as far as you can and sending everything at one go. 
Personally I don't see why it would be so hard for exchanges to have dynamic fees, or let you select your own fee so far as miners are concerned. But I suppose this is a profit center for them, and if they weren't profiting on withdraws they'd just have higher fees somewhere else.

Coinbase is one of the NYA signers. It's quite possible (and fully consistent with the lack of replay protection) that they will refuse to let you access your BTC and confiscate it instead, forcing you to accept B2X as the "real" bitcoin.
Keep in mind they still have not handed out their BCH from the August 1 fork. And don't plan to, supposedly, for months yet. So even if they don't take your BTC you might not see it for a _long_ time.

Actually, if it's over $10K I wouldn't do that as it triggers alerts in the banking system, causing attention you probably don't want.

It's utter trivia in the scheme of things. So long as you allow time for difficulty adjustments we could mine bitcoin with nothing more than smartphones if it came to that. So having a chunk of mining shut down, even a majority, is of little import and has only a brief impact on TX capacity.

You seem to have missed the fact that they are simply repeating the Caixin story from last Friday.
It is interesting that Monday has now passed in China without clarification. This makes the Chinese government look unacceptably sloppy and indifferent to its constituents and the world at large. Can anyone imagine a major rumor bursting forth about an entire class of securities being banned on Wall Street on a Friday afternoon, and not only does the SEC and entire Federal government lay low over the weekend, they manage to keep ignoring it the following Monday?
Come on PBOC, get a press conference organized and provide some clarity. Otherwise it really does look like a corrupt, cheesy "China bans Bitcoin" ploy by some cadre of officials looking to profit on the rumor-mongering.

One reason I've never liked investing in cash/precious metals is because they just sit there, doing nothing. Despite being attuned to the risk of hyperinflation, I could never stomach the risk of "investing" in a static investment that has little downside, but little upside as well (as measured against other commodities or basic goods).
So I invested in equities (never bonds) and did quite well over the years. A clone of me who had invested in silver/gold all along would be quite poor by comparison. 
When I invest in an equity, I'm giving money to a company that takes that money and actively tries to use it to earn more money. That gives it a huge advantage over buying silver/gold that just sits there.
When I first heart about bitcoin I was excited on an ideological level, but bothered because it seemed like another static investment. Bitcoin seemed _too much_ like silver/gold. 
Then one day it dawned on me that when I buy into bitcoin, I'm investing into a network of literally thousands of developers, businessmen and venture capitalists who are all working their tails off to make it a success. Instead of being static like a precious metal, it was more like buying stock in a for-profit firm. That eliminated one of my biggest hangups and helped me justify pouring more money into bitcoin in 2014-2016. Which turned out very well.

When I see charts that define "Early Adopter" they usually define it as the first 1%, or 2-3% of the population to adopt something. Bitcoin is used by maybe 10 million people, which is less than .15% of the global population. We are still very much in the early adoption stage.

You must be living in an alternate reality. B2X has zero dev support. It has close to zero real world support. Just a bunch of miner signaling (which means nothing since they will mine whatever has value regardless what they say now), and a couple businessmen trying to usurp bitcoin.
You watch what happens. Coinbase and Gemini are not going to destroy themselves supporting an altcoin with no serious support that risks creating chaos for bitcoin through no replay protect. They will never survive the lawsuits. They can't possibly be so stupid as to proceed with this.

Church donations are an area that could use more attention. 
To do it right (and make it more attractive to donors), the churches should make sure they are able to report the donations' cash value back to donors for itemization when doing taxes. Not sure how Canadian laws are for donations, but in the US if you itemize most charitable donations are tax deductible. 
The improved traceability of blockchain TX would be very helpful in an audit situation where a donor wanted to be able to prove they gave X amount of money to a charity. 
And on a side note, charitable contributions of Bitcoin make a fairly painless way to deal with all the headaches people have been having trying to figure their taxes on crypto investments. If you give it away and can itemize it all, up to certain limits you won't be hit with any taxes.

Oh, I'm holding a reserve just in case. Others should do likewise. But if someone blitzes them and the price can't recover it will shatter any remaining delusions about the viability of B2X, and the person doing it could be the last to earn a good profit off the BT2 tokens.

This is my situation - most of the early exchanges I used are long gone, and my early BTC was gained from mining dozens of altcoins with hundreds of trades between them and BTC.

If your interest in bitcoin is fairly recent and you've only been here 5 weeks, that means you didn't live through well over a year of certain miners and personalities subverting and obfuscating and FUDding against Segwit and making slanderous attacks on the development team. You didn't wake up to read about the lovely discovery known as ASICBoost, and then wake up and learn about Antbleed. You haven't endured months of ridiculous and bizarre twitter rants from the likes of Wu, Ver and Wright. You haven't enjoyed the lovely spectacle of spam attacks and empty blocks being used to drive TX fees through the roof by manipulators trying to coerce the bitcoin community that larger blocks and centralization under their control was the only solution. 
You've even missed the chaotic and disorganized way BCH was abruptly launched, forcing every bitcoin service and exchange out there to allocate resources and work overtime to cope with the mess they created, while bitcoin users wondered if someone would find a way to launch replay attacks. Or the people I dealt with on this sub who confused BCH with BCC or the BCC token on Bitfinex and sold at a big loss thinking they were getting a great deal, all because the Bitcoin Cash team didn't have enough sense or concern to pick a unique ticker symbol. Or the wild gyrations in mining hashpower after BCH launched because of their poorly conceived Emergency Difficulty Adjustment, affecting BTC users trying to transact in a timely manner.
So when you see someone who gets intemperate about BCH - cut them some slack. There are a ton of good reasons. It's been an extremely frustrating time dealing with them and the damage they have caused.

Yep, that was my thought: If you're going to quote Buffett on Bitcoin, the first quote that should be cited is his dictum to not invest in what you don't understand. And since he plainly doesn't understand it, it's worthless to quote his position on it whether pro or con.

I also have Szabo as the most likely candidate. Beyond his denial I've seen no strong reasons against him being Satoshi, and many things match up (educations/skills/interests, cryptography background, time zone, the odd absence of a reference to Bit Gold in the Bitcoin white paper, etc.)
And I agree with thieflar that Satoshi is one man. Not that he operated in a vacuum, but it took one mind to assemble all the pieces together conceptually to make Bitcoin work where so many other schemes had failed. It was not designed by committee.

Another thread here has a link to an article by one of the original code reviewers of Satoshi's work. A quote from it is fitting for this discussion:
" I was more aware than anyone (except maybe Satoshi and Hal) that literally scores of digital-cash systems had attempted to launch before then. And the road to progress, as Chuck Yeager observed, is marked by great smoking holes in the ground. The fact that you have probably never heard of any of those scores of launches should tell you how successful they were."

Not really. Are you looking at a different Coinmarketcap than I am?
The BTG (Bitcoin Gold) fork is probably a non-event, given the low profile of the backers. Why would anyone pump it by buying and support the price to any degree? We already have tons of alts including ASIC-resistant ones, so BTG is pointless. (If it were widely supported by Core and bitcoin businesses with promised post-fork development and use cases this would be different, but that's not the case.)
As for B2X, I predict it will not see the light of day. It's becoming too much of a risk and a burden for the NYA companies supporting it. Do they really want to face boycotts and possibly lawsuits and the mayhem of media reports of lost BTC due to replay attacks while supporting a coin with 1/3 the value of BTC and dropping already (which means no sensible miner will mine it, which means long block times, which means more price drops, repeat til dead)?

It occurs to me that Hyperbitcoinization is driven by fear rather than optimism. That is, right now people are getting into Bitcoin out of an optimistic hope that it will do well in the future. But the Hyperbitcoinization scenario is driven by the flip side of the equation: A gnawing fear by non-bitcoin users that the value of their fiat is dropping and will continue to drop.

These don't handle most of the cryptos on Bitfinex, nor do they have margin trading. We're losing a lot here that cannot be replaced by going to another exchange. 
Hopefully other exchanges expand and present new services (trading pairs and margin trading, futures markets and so forth) to fill the void. Poloniex has been pretty dead the last few months. I'm hoping they revive as traders migrate back to them.
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:45:44
The computing power is based on a couple factors. The number of coins already in circulation is not one of them. All else being equal, the hashrate (amount of mining firepower deployed) is a function of the value of the reward for mining a block. This is based on:
1. The price of bitcoin. If the price rises it makes sense for miners to buy more mining HW; if it falls the most marginal miners will drop out.
2. The block reward. This is the amount of new bitcoins created with each block. It cuts in 1/2 every 4 years, so this actually is becoming less of an issue over time.
3. The fees from transactions. As  becomes negligible over time this will be the major source of revenue for miners. As users we want the fees to be low for obvious reasons, HOWEVER there does need to be a non-trivial TX fee reward in the future as block rewards approach zero. This is because if the fees are trivial the amount of mining hardware will also drop, and the risks of a 51% attack being possible and actually happening increase. So users are ultimately incentivized to tolerate a decent TX fee in the long run to protect Bitcoin from attack.

The hashrate will follow value. The value of B2X has been holding at 1/3 the value of BCT in the futures market (remarkably stably so) since the market opened over a week ago. Miners in general are not going to mine the fork with only 1/3 the revenue. BCH proved that already.

You could list a thousand bits of good news over that time frame, but in my opinion it's better to step back and look at the big picture. I believe it is just a part of a price discovery process that has been going on since Day 1 of bitcoin (the last 9 months are not exceptional compared to the overall 8 years).
When bitcoin first launched it was quickly apparent that it had the potential to be a Very Big Deal - a censorship-resistant, fast, efficient, secure method of transferring value around the world and across any boundaries. A store of value more convenient and securable than physical gold. A scarce resource not subject to inflation (and thus value destruction) like government-controlled fiat. 
As such it _could_ be worth trillions of dollars. 
But what if it had bugs in it? What if governments worked overtime to destroy it before it could gain a following? What if it came under the control of manipulators akin to a central bank? What if it couldn't scale? What if someone came out with a better cryptocurrency and everyone flocked to it?
These and other risks had to be weighed in the balance when assessing what Bitcoin is and will be worth. In essence when you look at the price over time, yes, there's always the market froth of trading - exuberance one day, despair the next. But underneath that is the continuous assessment of the market in how well Bitcoin is achieving its potential versus how serious the obstacles are that are arrayed against it.
When you consider that Bitcoin's value is still only a tiny fraction of it's full potential, the market is saying it is still pessimistic that it will overcome all obstacles. Those of us who have bought in are more optimistic about the odds. I think many of the hurdles have already been crossed, and there is a pretty good roadmap for the remaining ones like scaling. So I think the future is bright - and the market, at least a little bit, has been agreeing with that.

Also no counterfeiting, no forged checks, no chargeback hassles. No fees for armored cars/physical security to transport cash to the bank, faster closure to settlement than checks or credit cards (that take days or months for final confirmations). 
There are a lot of advantages for merchants to use bitcoin, which is why, eventually, they should be offering discounts to users who pay with bitcoin compared to more expensive fiat/traditional methods.

As for their tricks, here's an example:
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:28:11
The futures markets are allowing us to split our BTC now and sell or keep whichever coins we want. In my case I've split some and sold the B2X, reinvesting the funds into more of the BTC token. So if the fork is called off I got free money and the buyers of the B2X token are left with nothing. Conversely if they destroy the Bitcoin blockchain I'm left with worthless tokens.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:51:46
Yeah, good point. 2014 is the year Bitcoiners don't like to talk about.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:12:26
That's meaningless signaling as we saw from the BCH fork. 
The Bitfinex futures market is showing the B2X token at 1/3 the value of the BTC token due to substantial whale support. Even assuming that holds up until the fork that means miners are only earning 1/3 as much on B2X if they stay with their signaling. 
There will be 1152 blocks they will need to solve to get to the next difficulty adjustment after the hardfork. Even assuming someone is dedicated enough to mine it at a substantial loss the blocks will be very slow and the chain vulnerable to a 51% attack. This will further weigh the price down as complaints spread post-fork. With no EDA and weeks or months of slow and unprofitable blocks B2X may simply be abandoned by the miners regardless of the current show of support.

Legal but still totally scuzzy and purely parasitic. If Core can come up with an effective way to prevent or punish miners who fail to validate TX - which is the point of mining - I'm all for it.
Bitcoin has miners to add transactions to the blockchain, not as a welfare system for well-capitalized geeks. If all they do is freeload by taking the block rewards while treating the entire bitcoin community with contempt by leaving our TX's hanging, they shouldn't be surprised if we come after them with pitchforks and torches.

There are too many parameters where optimizing for one of these two basic functions will conflict with the other goal, so they cannot coexist. You can either have maximum security or you can have maximum convenience, but you cannot have both. A coin that is fast/instant to transact with is a coin that is less secure, and so on. (Edit: And a coin with high velocity - inherent with cash usage - will have a lower value as a result and drive those who seek high value crazy.)
My personal opinion is that Bitcoin as the flagship of cryptocurrency should be a store of value. Let other coins linked by atomic swaps take over the role of digital cash and so forth. Let each be optimized for their purpose. Because in the long run any coin that is not optimized or tries to be a jack of all trades will end up being master of none and will be outcompeted.
I know this conflicts with what a lot of people have been thinking and assuming, especially with LN/off-chain scaling. But the conflict between cash and store of value is deep and intractable, in my opinion, so the debate will have to happen and be resolved.

Careful - historically there has always been a premium on the price of GBTC because it was about the only way for institutional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. That's changing now, and as a result the premium is fading away.

While it's possible to draw up a list of things they are not doing, it's rather more useful to look at what they are doing. NK is an extremely oppressive regime with a large labor/death camp system, extreme brainwashing of the citizenry, a repressive police state and so on. It had widespread starvation not so long ago due to the extreme emphasis on militarism without concern for individual liberty or well-being. 
The fanatical state cult of leader-worship makes it the most repressive state in the world as regards religious freedom. There is no reason to imagine that such a state with great wealth at its disposal would do a thing to help its own people, but rather use it to create mischief for surrounding nations and for grandoise monuments to honor the folly of its ruling caste. It would prop up that which ought to be pulled down and destroyed.

That doesn't sound right. Are you referring to the $31 to $2 cycle that was a few years earlier? From late 2013 to 2014 IIRC the price went from ~$1150 to $178 (flash crash, daily low was around $200), which is not -92%.

Probably this will get clarified in the next 12 hours as it hits business hours Monday in China. But I'm betting it was all hogwash. Most likely, as has been reported, China is putting in place regulations that will allow investors back into ICO's and will reopen those gates down the line. 
As for bitcoin exchanges themselves, with China dominating the mining of bitcoin, it makes very little sense for them to seriously trash bitcoin. They as a nation are profiting too much from bitcoin.

1. The Core scaling efforts are much more refined than the brute-force "double the blocksize" approach of the SW2X hard fork. See  for more info. See  for why the SW2X approach was a bad idea.
2. B2X is how we are all referring to the SW2X hard fork coin that would double the block size, favored by the NYA supporters. F2Pool was signaling for it (along with most other mining pools); their rejection of it now takes it below the level of support of being a "consensus" change, which is what all hard forks should be for safety and security reasons.
3. The BT1 and BT2 tokens are for a futures market on Bitfinex. At the hardfork BT1 tokens convert to regular BTC (what we have now), and BT2 tokens convert to the B2X coin. If the hard fork doesn't happen the BT2 token is worthless. If the fork happened and the NYA backers won and miners stopped mining the current protocol blockchain, the BT1 coin would be worthless.
The risks are receding, but news about the hardfork is something you should certainly be paying attention to. If you buy bitcoin be sure to move it to a wallet under your control (not on an exchange), and be aware of the risk of replay attacks when moving coins. (See  Note that the NYA team is still pushing a "replay protection" methodology that is obnoxious and requires some expertise on your part to safely utilize. (See

In other words, making threatening noises and appearing to exercise strong control over "lawless" crypto markets to ease the transition. That's plausible I guess, though I also think the original Caixin report may be a badly muddled account that refers more to the ICO ban than anything else.

If you look at the futures market the price support rests very heavily on a couple whale orders arrayed like lines of defensive entrenchment. It's been like that for a week. Someone dumped 400 BT2 tokens today and it overran their defenses around .25 and has driven them down to the .226 wall, which is 15% eaten through now. 
They have 200 BT2 walls at .215 and .2, and then a 500 token wall at .185. Once that defense is broken there will be little to prop it up. Anyone want to throw 1000+ BTC in to make about 200 BTC profit and smash this thing once and for all?

Two reasons:
1. Unless you are the sort of person who loses their keys on a weekly basis or constantly downloads malware, you are better off controlling your own Bitcoin keys. When you leave Bitcoin on an exchange you are trusting them not to abscond with it or get hacked. And many people have run afoul of Coinbase's Terms of Service (or Coinbase thought they did), and then have a real hassle getting access to their funds when they want them. A major point of Bitcoin is freedom, and you lose that if you find yourself in a horribly-drawn out argument with Coinbase Support over whether you once sent coins to an address associated with a casino, or whatever.
2. When the BCH fork happened Coinbase was slow to acknowledge it, leading to fears it would simply steal the BCH coins owed to customers who had BTC on account with them. Eventually they said they would distribute the BCH coins, but the distribution is still months in the future, which is ridiculous.
For the 2X fork they are openly trying to flat out destroy the legacy Bitcoin blockchain, so it would be inconsistent for them to tell customers they will distribute both coins. If you keep BTC on Coinbase you should expect they will only give you the B2X forked coin after the hardfork. It's not at all clear they will ever give you your legacy BTC even if the B2X fork becomes a minor altcoin like BCH or fails entirely.

Keep in mind that for months the Big Blocker crowd was crowing about how they had this imaginary majority support, all the miners were with them, etc. etc. and the UASF would never work. Then when BCH actually launched, surprise, surprise, miners simply mined what was profitable.
So when B2X launches and the price on it is only a tiny fraction of Bitcoin, why would you think the miners will react any differently? It's B2X that is going to wind up with 100 minute blocks, and no EDA to fix things. 
As for the notion of Core abandoning Bitcoin for this usurpation attempt, where is the evidence? It's certainly not here:
Maybe they can all jump ship to Litecoin, worst case. That's where I will be.

OK, now that I've read through it, Vinny seems terribly concerned at the poor miners and businesses who are being treated so roughly by the mean nasty users and developers. Those impoverished, tortured miners and businessmen are slaving away for us without due respect and decent treatment, and so they are rising in revolt and demanding that they have their say (and better working conditions no doubt).
Vinny, that's delusional!
First off, Bitcoin was designed to do away with centralized control and a favored group that controls transactions and siphons money into their own coffers. If miners take the place of banks in a new financial system then we've failed utterly in this project. They ought to be thankful for the tremendous profits they've earned and stop being so greedy for more.
Miners _should_ be powerless, so far as mining goes. As holders of bitcoin they should have a commensurate voice same as the rest of us. But the idea that they should be a power-wielding faction makes no sense. Mining is just a necessary evil to secure the network, not an end in itself and certainly not a welfare system we came up with to make certain people rich. 
Honestly, the mindset Vinny displays all through these messages is just terrible. The fact that it is being tolerated and apparently has support in other quarters frightens me even more.

You make a good point; now, let's brainstorm some solutions. Anyone have any ideas that would not be easily gamed or cause problems for well-behaved miners and users?
One obstacle that has been raised is that if you write code to, say, cancel the block reward for miners who mine an empty block more than X time after the prior block while leaving TX in the mempool, they can counter by just including a bunch of fake/spam TX. So we'd need a way to prioritize or distinguish between "real" user TX and spammed-up TX a miner introduces just to get around such a penalty system.

What is to stop miners from colluding to extort whatever prices they can from the market? 
Miners' job is to process TX. When they have space available and refuse to do so they are specifically failing in that job. Instead they are treating Bitcoin as their personal cash cow, at the expense of users.
Users either need to aggressively demonstrate that they will move funds off BTC to better alternatives (LTC, etc.), or tools need to be developed that punish miners for refusing to process TX.
Miners, if you want to destroy Bitcoin in favor of miner-free alternatives (POS coins, Byteball, IOTA etc.), this is the right way to do it.

Well, if B2X launches with 90% mining hashrate I think the mining hashrate advantage will be shortlived. So it would be "Bitcoin" for only a short while before miners defected to the legacy chain to maintain profitability once they realized users will not be so easily persuaded. 
The notion of a long-running split with miners trenchantly mining a low-value chain while users stuck to a different chain is extremely unlikely. So hopefully the dispute over which would "really" be Bitcoin is academic.

Miners have to follow economic  value. And they very obviously do, as we can see from the swinging hashrates between BCH and BTC. So when 2X forks off and is dumped like BCH (or worse, as a pointless intermediate), 90+% of those NYA miners will be gone back to BTC in a New York minute.
That's assuming B2X can even get listed on an exchange without replay protection. B2X is radioactive for exchanges because of the risks it creates for lost coins (and very angry customers). 
And then there's the little problem of nodes. The B2X network is likely to be so weak as to be very vulnerable to attack. 
I don't understand why Barry hasn't torn up the NYA in public. My best guess is he's shorting Bitcoin and intends to drag this out as an extension to the China news and FUD for the greatest profitability he can wring out of it. If so October could be bearish for BTC.

The  market will price each of the forks based on its assessment of the prospects for each (actually this is already happening on the Bitfinex futures market - BTC is worth about 3X the B2X token.)
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:52:54
You will get B2X if you have your Bitcoin in a wallet. But the B2X crew has deliberately abandoned any pretense at offering replay protection, which means if you don't know what you are doing you are very likely to lose Bitcoin or B2X first time you try to transact with it. 
That's why they suggest sending it to them. They presumably will manage things competently, allowing users to split and sell their B2X and Bitcoin safely.
Edit: Here's a good article covering Replay Protection, albeit a little out of date since the NYA dev has apparently decided against doing any replay protection at all.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:17:33
A lot of people have been talking about it, but the known effort put forth by the putative developers of it has been absolutely minimal.
Maybe they are doing some work to prep it for release on 10/25, but I wouldn't be surprised if 10/25 comes and goes with ... nothing. The absence of any firm information about the coin, about replay protection, and about exchanges and wallets to support it just 12 days out is ludicrous.

ASICs for mining are more efficient precisely because they are precisely tailored to the algorithm used in the mining, which makes them useless for anything else. Whereas supercomputers needs to be flexible enough to handle a range of problems within their intended research purpose. The difference is orders of magnitude in efficiency. These design contraints rule out the concept of any hardware being both an efficient miner and a "supercomputer" for any other purpose.

It's hard to say, absent a futures market or polling data. I don't see much sign of them having many people on board, but then I didn't think BCH would have much staying power either. My gut feeling is that they will have a harder time than BCH though, because they are fighting a 2-front war between BCH and BTC.

Bitfinex has a futures market where you can split your BTC into an equal number of BT1 and BT2 tokens. At the hardfork the BT1 tokens become current bitcoin and the BT2 becomes the B2X token. (I had it backwards in my post, sorry). 
So you can split your BTC now, keep the BT1 (will revert back to being Bitcoin), and sell your BT2 now for almost .25 BTC per BT2. I expect that is far better than anyone will get once the hardfork actually happens. And if it doesn't happen then those who sold BT2 tokens will have profited while everyone waiting for the fork to dump their B2X will have missed out.

If there is no God then there is nothing wrong with inflicting massive pain and suffering. It's all just atoms colliding without meaning. 
But you are right - the pain and suffering are real and meaningful, because there is a God who gives life meaning. Whether inflicted by a theist or an atheist suffering is a tragedy. But God himself died for us to save us from our self-inflicted tragedy of sin. You can't earn your way into His good graces because we are all sinners and guilty. But you are forgiven. Ephesians 2:8-9.
You've chosen to focus on hate. But the "religious zealotry" I'm familiar with are the innumerable Christians who sacrifice earthly pleasures and sometimes their lives ministering to others. Like the people in the mission my wife recently worked with in El Salvador, where atheists burst into a house worship service four days before she arrived and gunned down a mother of four children. Or the elder in the congregation they killed months earlier after raping his daughter. Now I use bitcoin to pay for a pastor to minister in the gang village where the attackers live, to reach them with the love of Christ.

But Bitcoin's antifragility is not based on magic. Part of its robustness is based on a community response to threats, including lots of yelling and shouting and rowdiness.

Zoom out on the charts. It's following a regular pattern. Either HODL or sit out, wait for the bottom and jump back in (the smart money, well smarter than me anyway, has been out for some time and is waiting for the bottom.)
All I've heard from various sources is that Wall Street and big investors have not given up on Bitcoin. Rather it's a belief that a correction off the 20K high was inevitable, and they are salivating to get back in - when the price is right. So once they feel a bottom has been reached you'll see a lot of investment money coming back in, slowly or quickly.

Take away all the welfare/vote buying/social security schemes and most of what is left is military spending in all its forms, and for its legitimate needs the military doesn't need to be 1/10 the size. 
I was with the Michigan Militia in the 90's, and I'd point out that a single armored division and a small force of infantry, backed by a revitalized militia, along with a small but robust navy and air force would be more than enough to secure our borders against all current adversaries. The skilled Mexican wehrmacht, the savage Canadian hordes, and the mighty Cuban high seas fleet are just not that much of a threat.

It's quite plain. The top level page says $133M now. If you drill down it gives the total supply (like you said, only 2% is released and thus part of the market cap calculation). But it's plain from the figures that Coinmarketcap is using the circulating supply for the market cap calculation. This is consistent with everything else - for example Bitcoin market cap is based on the coins mined, not the final coin supply in the year 2140.
You've picked an extreme example, and that's fine for making the point that market caps don't tell everything. But they are not useless. What else are we supposed to use to rank the economic impact of coins by?

Yes. They will have to get through another 1152 blocks to reach the next post-fork block adjustment.
If they have, say, 25% hashrate that will only take them ~5 weeks. But that's a lot of miners to be mining at a loss if they are only getting 1/3 or 1/4 the revenue. (Note that the futures market deteriorated over the last few hours for the B2X futures token). 
More likely it would just be diehard NYA supporters, willing to make such an effort. But if they are only 5-10% of current hashrate that means mining for months to reach the difficulty adjustment, during which the blocks will be terribly slow which will not help the price one bit. Realistically the fork will die off in such a scenario without something like an EDA or algorithm change.

1. Some people make transactions, meaning to only spend one set of forked coins (or not even knowing about the fork), only to find later the recipient has the coins from the other fork due to replay attacks (or even just accident). 
2. Word gets out that people are losing coins; scammers find ways to exploit the situation on anyone who is as yet unwary about the situation.
3. The prices of both forks start plummeting on exchanges. Off exchanges, almost no one feels safe moving their coins. Use of bitcoin plummets. Darknet TX shift entirely to dash/monero/zcash/whatever; legit businesses shift to litecoin. 
4. BCH supporters see an opening and pump their price. Miners flock back over to BCH, leaving the two hardfork chains languishing. Now the media is reporting (1) people are losing their money, (2) crypto users are abandoning bitcoin for alts, and (3) block times are soaring as miners embrace BCH. 
5. This scares the bejeebers even out of hodlers, who decide not to be bagholders and flee BTC in every direction - be it alts, litecoin, BCH, tether or fiat. The plummeting price puts more miners out of the game, block times rise to the point where the BTC forks are effectively non-functional, while NYA supporters and opponents bitterly blame each other.
6. Litecoin becomes ascendant, but only after a bit of a slugfest with the BCH cartel. Life goes on, but BTC hodlers are ruined.
OK, so that's my nightmare scenario...

The support is factional, not overwhelming.
Bitcoin's ecosystem can be understood as being composed of several different factions, such as:

3. Miners
4. Businesses
SW2X was cobbled together  between groups  and 4. But it is group 2 that ultimately decides the fate of anything in bitcoin, and group 1 is not insignificant.

I've been wargaming scenarios for the fork while everyone else was partying over the new ATH. One key question that emerged is: What role will BCH and the EDA have as the fork hits? Looks like the BCH/B2X forces are strategizing over that very question. 
Nov. 13 is the same date that I estimate the hardfork to hit, so this is no coincidence. By eliminating the EDA they are eliminating the temptation for miners to chase profits on BCH right when they need hashpower on B2X (and/or to attack the BTC chain).
I expect B2X to fail, but this is the sort of thing they have to be doing if they are serious and active in preparing to fight and win. Stay vigilant.

No, on August 1 you received an equal amount of BCH for your BTC - if you know how to separate it out safely in your wallet. If your BTC was on an exchange you'll need to see how each exchange handled the fork. Some made the BCH available very quickly, others are taking a lot of time to do so.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:11:26
My take: The bottom will be when the bad news is done. There will be attempted corrections, but they will be knee-capped by more bad news as additional exchanges close. It's hard to believe the market will start pumping on news confirming OKcoin, Huobi, etc. are being shut down, for example. Once the closures actually happen, and if nothing terrible is happening on the SW2X side, we may see a real rally. Before that I'd say it's risky to jump back in prematurely.

I've seen a couple comments lately about how BCH and Bitcoin can just peacefully coexist. It occurs to me that this does not appear likely so long as they share the same algorithm (and thus mining hardware). Shared hardware creates a risk of these sorts of "attacks" with resulting delays and congestion and spiking fees, which in turn impacts usability and price. 
Which means that significant competitors sharing Bitcoin's mining hardware are a risk, and there is incentive to destroy the competition (ie, eliminate it as an economically significant factor), or be harmed/destroyed itself. 
I think BCH supporters may want to consider that carefully going forward and consider an algorithm change. I don't mean this as a threat, but rather a prediction.

When exchanges are hacked customers lose their money. So customers have an incentive to use insured exchanges, and exchanges have an incentive to be insured.
Customer collectively lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the fall of Mt. Gox. Even if they are repaid "in full" in fiat they will have missed out on the price increase since then, which amounts to a ~billion dollars more.

It has always made sense to me because of the cost savings due to no counterfeiting, chargebacks, forgeries, credit card fees, bounced checks, etc. that merchants would ultimately want to offer a discount for paying with bitcoin. 
To be fair,  we need instant TX via the LN or similar techniques for this to work. But I am looking forward to this becoming a trend. Volatility is sometimes mentioned as an issue, but if the volatility is generally in the up direction I imagine some companies would figure it's a nice problem to have.

1. Coinbase has a lot of complaints about customer service, and this has been true a long time. I've tried their new phone support # and it was worthless as well. Gemini has offered much better service in this regard, as a point of comparison.
2. Coinbase has a reputation for going overboard when it comes to canceling accounts for any real or imagined violation of terms of service. So read them carefully and comply carefully. (There was one period where they had my account on hold for 6 months for no reason that made any sense, and they insisted on calling my personal checking account a "business account" despite there being no reason whatever that I could think of for them to ever imagine such a thing.)
3. Their handling of the BCH fork was awful - they don't plan on releasing customers' BCH coins from August 1 until next year (!) Given the death spiral BCH has been in, customers will have lost most of their potential profit from the fork by then. 
4. Likewise, Coinbase is a NYA supporter, and is likely to use their influence to cajole or coerce customers into supporting the B2X fork. They may refuse to allow customers to access their Bitcoins in favor of forked B2X coins, for example, after the fork, in an attempt to kill off the current chain.
Coinbase didn't gain their current significant role by being incompetent or horrible, but these red flags have put me off from using them where there is any comparable alternative. Just my 2 satoshis.

It wouldn't destroy bitcoin. Satoshi has every right to spend his coins. People are just afraid of the effect of suddenly having a million BTC dumped on the market at once. 
But there's no reason to suppose he would do something so rash anyway, even if he did have a purpose for trading some bitcoin. And even if he did dump it all the market would absorb the extra BTC as the rest of us bought on the dip, knowing that this would be to rest the uncertainty of those coins being dumped. With that possibility behind us Bitcoin would be stronger than ever moving forward.

Good point about a BCH-takeover push being less likely without the EDA as a tool to attract miners. But if that's true it means B2X is their primary tool if they are plotting to supplant BTC.

I  agree and have been making this argument for months. But it hinges heavily on how much control and influence Ver and Wu have, and how far they are willing to push things in their hubris. 
It seems to me that if this was the whole story the NYA would have been abandoned once the futures markets made it clear we don't want their fork. 
Yesterday the BCH team announced the EDA would be eliminated just ahead of the Bitcoin fork. I don't think the timing is a coincidence. This suggests to me that Wu and Ver have influence but not control over a portion of the NYA-signaling miners, and are trying to avoid losing some of their hashrate during the fork due to miners chasing after the BCH EDA profits.
For all my frustration with them, Wu strikes me as a very good strategist and this could be part of a plan to keep the miners focused on fighting to win this battle. The irony is that the NYA team cannot win in the long run. They can destroy the legacy chain, but that will just scare the market away from bitcoin and its resulting centralization. They can destroy Bitcoin but they cannot ride it to the moon if they win.

They can't send it to their Ethereum wallet, but if another altcoin uses the same public key/checksum arrangement it could produce an acceptable address. (In that case, wouldn't it be fixable by digging up the private key from the altcoin wallet and manually entering it into a bitcoin wallet?)

It's basic economics. Any "whale" (wealthy investor) can buy up a scarce resource and force the price to rise. So long as they don't put it back on the market for sale the remainder of the market has to fight over the remaining units of the resource. This causes the price to rise. 
Oversimplified example: If 5 people want 5 oranges, but a whale comes along and buys 3 oranges, then the 5 people bid up the price on the remaining 2 oranges until 3 of the people drop out of the bidding and only the last two get an orange.

Some of the offers are expired, but if you had coins the date of the airdrop and the offer is still open you can still claim them. 
In some cases like Byteball you had to register the BTC address beforehand so that would be out too. There's another Byteball airdrop on Nov. 4 but the rewards for BTC holders now are slim, as someone else mentioned. Mostly it's geared now towards HODLers of Byteball who buy in ahead of the airdrop.

The trajectory for BCH is downhill. The B2X fork, if it launches and survives for any length of time, is likely to cannibilize support from BCH.
Moreover, Coinbase is still holding its customers' BCH coins, and there may be others out there yet to be dumped. When Coinbase releases theirs that will cause another hit to the price.
BCH was a coin created by miners, for miners, to eke out some more profit from ASICBoost. It has no purpose from a user point of view that is not better served by other cryptos. I would not try to catch this falling knife, because I expect it to hit the ground.

Never heard of Remitano.
As far as being a bubble, that implies Bitcoin has a true value that is a good deal lower than the current market value. To assess this you need to think about where Bitcoin will be in 10 years. If you think it will be outcompeted or has a fatal flaw then its value is zero, and this is a bubble. But if it is the new digital gold and destined to take a prominent role in global finance then it is wildly undervalued. The current market price reflects the tension between these two viewpoints.

A rock solid way to prove your bitcoin reserves (and much better than a screenshot that can be obviously photoshopped) would be to move the coins to a wallet you control. 
Most wallets have the ability to generate a signature that lets you demonstrate unambiguously that you control the private key that allows spending of the bitcoin linked to the public key. You might need to explain that to the bank with some links or a tutorial, but it would be much better than methods banks currently accept to prove reserves.
You'd just deposit your bitcoin, open the Sign tool in the wallet, and enter a message like "I (NAME), control the the bitcoins at this address (PUBLIC KEY) and offer this as proof of my reserves for (BANK NAME) on (DATE)." This way no one else can copy/paste your signature and misuse it at a later date. You'll also want a link to blockchain.info or something similar showing the actual bitcoin balance for the bank to check.

Atheists in the past century have murdered tens of millions of theists in an orgy of hate. In recent years even in places like America mass-murdering atheists have repeatedly targeted churches or asked their victims "Do you believe in God?" before gunning them down. It is ironic that that who rail against "hate" and "religious violence" are the biggest haters and enactors of religious violence of all, and have chosen the one religious viewpoint that cannot coherently condemn that violence.
You see, if there is no God then there's nothing wrong with hating others. So your objection only holds up if your premise of no God is untrue. Hating others and doing ill to them are bad only if there is a God who says it is bad. Otherwise you can say one thing and I can say diametrically the opposite, and if there's no God it's all just because of atoms banging around in our craniums and means nothing either way.
We should love others because God loves them, and that's really the only foundation that works. And yes, we should hate the sin - don't steal, don't lie, be faithful to your spouse, don't kill - only because of what it does to the people that we should love. 
Don't believe the lie that this restricts choice. It grants freedom. When you cultivate sin in your life it takes over. I see too many people my age wallowing in gluttony (hard to have the choice to do things when you are morbidly obese), struggling with alcoholism and drugs (where's the freedom in an addiction), saddled with alimony and family discord (there goes financial freedom, not to mention juggling schedules on which nights you get the kids), or the grief of a burdened conscience (the ultimate slavery for imprisons your own mind). 
No, right living gives real freedom. I can see this easily enough through the years just by looking around me. And sharing that fact with others while they stuff their faces with food or chase orgasms or drugs or any other vice is love, not hate.

I don't know who is propping up the price at this point but they clearly aren't paying attention. If the price gets down around $1500 before the fork I could see myself buying back in, but not any higher.

Be careful. The clock is almost certainly overestimating the time remaining, so it will happen sooner than this. There was a 21% difficulty jump a few days ago, and there will be another a few days before the fork. The constant growth in hashrate means blocks are coming a good deal faster than 10 minutes.
When I mentioned this a few days ago Bashco said he assumed 10 minute blocks after rejecting the option of making a guess at the actual block rate. Now it looks like he's modified it,  but the BCH EDA has probably thrown it off. 
(At this moment it says 2243 blocks remaining with a target of Nov. 16 at 4:18 AM. But that's only 83 blocks more than 2160, which nominally takes exactly 14 days at 10 minute blocks. So if Bashco's clock was still using 10 minute blocks it should be reading about ~9 AM November 15 (UTC) by my napkin-math.)
Bottom line is I'm estimating the target to be November 13, +/- 1 day. Bashco's clock should converge towards it as we get closer, but beware the EDA throwing it off and keep count of the actual blocks remaining.

Some people learn to turn to God, and others rail against Him. The latter does not solve anything.
But you've made an interesting choice for a conversation in English - Allah. The deity of the Muslims. Like all other religions (including atheistic ones) it teaches that you are saved by following a bunch of rules. Only in Christianity do you find the obvious observation that no one keeps all the rules (whatever they may be) perfectly. We are saved by God's sacrifice not our own imperfect efforts.
So to those who complain about the state of things and demand that God fix it, I'd point out that He is. And to those who say He's to blame, although it was man that sinned, in his federal authority over man he took the blame and died on the cross for us. All that is left for us to do is lay down our arms against him and repent. Our good works henceforth are not to earn anything, but a reflection of thankfulness. 
As an engineer I do what works. I've found that repentance and faith in Christ work, and that rejection just leads to futility. May God's grace be upon you.

It's not a good analogy, because I could point out that you would still have the title to the car and could have the police arrest them for stealing the car at that point. 
Perhaps a better analogy would be to the days when people sent cash through the mail. A person might have occasionally stuffed cash in the wrong envelope. Intending to buy some garments from Sears, instead they stuffed $20 into an envelope along with a letter to the editor of a newspaper. 
In this case one could say the recipient has no legal obligation. But if it was clear-cut that the money was not intended to go to them, and it's a trivial effort to return it (I'm sure the sender would be happy to pay for the stamp or the TX fee), then it's really scuzzy of someone to hang onto the money.

The problem with that is you are claiming that a currency that can be and often is manipulated by one self-interested faction, will outcompete one whose coin supply and emission schedule is virtually impossible to change. That's very naive.
Look at the "gold standard" of fiat currencies, the US Dollar. It's lost virtually all of its value in the last hundred years. It is under the effective control of the U.S. government, which is perhaps the largest debtor on earth, and as such is _deeply_ motivated to artificially alter the money supply to keep interest rates low and steal from savers via inflation. 
Bitcoin frees us from such manipulation. As the population grasps this governments will be powerless to stop the flight out of their manipulated and abused currencies into quality money. (I'm sure they'll try, but every ban will leak with a thousand different holes, and lead another cohort of people to realize just why the government is doing it.)
The growth of Bitcoin's  value from zero to $6K is just a beginning to this process. If your claim of a government-backed currency had any merit we never would have gotten this far in the first place.

BCH was created by a splinter group offshoot from a splinter group of miners. It rejects Segwit and everything being built on Segwit (such as the Lightning Network) in favor of larger maximum block sizes. So transactions in BCH will all remain on the BCH blockchain, while many/most TX on Bitcoin in the future will be offchain on 2nd-layer payment channels.
BCH has a very thin dev team and is trying to scale purely through larger block sizes increases the cost of operating a node, increasing centralization of their network. For that reason I don't expect it to do well over time. There are many altcoins that offer more functionality and stronger support. (The one article I've seen covering BCH's plans for the future simply announced a readiness to keep making blocks larger as needed.) 
Note that the price is propped up so far largely by the fact that few people have bothered to dump the BCH coins they got when it was created as a fork on August 1. Many people have their BCH locked up on exchanges like Coinbase until the exchanges get around to releasing the coins. When that happens there will be more downward pressure on BCH.

The pattern has been for Bitcoin to grow over time at a rate much faster than normal investments. I'm not talking about the wild spikes, just the periods of strong growth such as prevailed from early 2015 through most of 2017. People watching see it going up and keep buying in, keeping it moving upwards.
Eventually so many people are doing this, and throwing additional money in, that the rate of increase ratchets up and the price starts climbing quickly. FOMO sets in and people start panic buying, not wanting to be left out. This is where the vertical spikes in the Bitcoin price chart appear. 
What follows is predictable: the panic buying tops out, everyone looks at the chart and can't stomach buying more after such a huge runup. Smart people (smarter than I) start selling, which causes the price to dip. With few willing to buy the price starts to tank quickly, fear takes over and you then see the stampede in the opposite direction as panic selling ensues. 
Just as the price overshot on the way up, now it overshoots on the way down. There's a  trendline you can draw along the long-term price charts that is pretty smooth, around which Bitcoin's actual price bobbles. Eyeballing it I'd say we should be at somewhere in the ballpark of $11-12,000 right now, and gradually growing from there.

Send your fiat from Coinbase to their in-house exchange GDAX (free/instant transfer). You can then buy without the Coinbase extra charge, either for .25% if you take an order or for 0% if you are the order maker on a limit order.
Or just go to Gemini for a flat .25% fee either way. I've been having a much better experience with Gemini support than Coinbase lately, and that's becoming the deciding factor quite apart from Coinbase's role in the NYA.

One catch is that there is no replay protection. This is a hostile fork meaning that the attackers are trying to actively destroy the existing blockchain. If people are losing coins due to replay attacks and hostile miners are empty-block mining the minority chain it's possible/likely that the price on both chains will suffer badly until it is all resolved. (Worst case this makes Mt. Gox look like a small-town bank heist in terms of impact.)

-Entire core development community is against it.
-Overly tight timing, with not nearly enough time to properly discuss, test and implement changes
-Missing opportunities to roll other changes requiring a hard fork into this one, since it is an 'outsider' effort. This means either other changes wait or we need to do another HF sooner than later.
-Severe absence of community support
-Bloating of UTXO and blockchain with larger blocks leading to higher node costs, leading to centralization

My question was related to the plausibility (technical feasibility and cost) of jamming the frequency(s) of the Blockstream satellite service, and how feasible it would for a hostile government to maintain that jamming most/all the time over most/all the population. 
Regarding communication channels, my understanding is that China is also moving to ban VPNs. I'm sure we can come up with 1001 ways a TX _could_ be sent out. Ideally there will be reliable, simple and robust services that Chinese bitcoiners can use for such a task that cannot easily be shut down or DDOS'd by the government, yet are easily accessible to any interested citizen.

Blockchain.info is an online wallet. You are trusting them not to get hacked and/or disappear tomorrow. 
As others mentioned, having a backup physically away from your home (in case a disaster destroys it) is a must.
The best wallet for you depends on your own situation, but it should be something under your control, not online. A paper wallet or hardware wallet may be best if you are not adept at securing your computer against virus/malware, but if physical theft is a concern (burglarly/mugging) then maybe a computer-based solution like Electrum is as good or better.

The last cycle we had the China frenzy in the fall of 2013 maxing out. But it really took Mt. Gox getting worse and worse and then totally collapsing to send the market into a death spiral. 
This time around I see a lot of bullishness based on new investors. After years of mentioning bitcoin to relatives and acquaintances and getting absolutely no positive response I've had 2 "going in, what do I need to know?" queries. People show up here many times every day saying they are getting into Bitcoin.
So I think people are still upbeat and jumping in at any sign of a dip. I believe it will take another strong shock like Mt. Gox to produce a severe bear market. I mean, even China closing all its exchanges was barely a blip by comparison. So we have to be talking something really severe.
The NYA hardfork turning into a real train wreck is about the only thing I see that is big enough to do this. If we get a contentious fork and miners keep killing the current chain by mining empty blocks and orphaning good ones, and reports spread of replay attacks and people losing serious money such that it fills the headlines in mainstream media, that could do it.
So could E.U. or U.S.A. regulators coming down on Bitcoin in a really bad way, but there's no sign of that happening. I think if we get past the fork in one piece things will keep moving up just based on limited supply and solid demand.

Miners are one faction within the bitcoin ecosystem, with economic incentives that in some ways are diametrically opposed to everyone else.
Bitcoin exists for the sake of users, not the businesses (including miners) that make money off the users by providing goods and services (such as securing and processing transactions). If we let the businesses govern Bitcoin we might as well slouch back to central banks as it puts us back into the same position.
And what about the poor businesses if users are in control? Well, if users want certain goods and services they need to pay for them. Businesses that do so efficiently will earn a profit and succeed. There is absolutely no need for them to have a say - any say at all - in the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin doesn't exist for them. It exists for us all.

I think cryptocurrency would have been achieved eventually, but from comments I've seen on the minimal interest level when Bitcoin launched (I mean at a deep technical level), it's clear only a few people were even close to having the requisite foundational knowledge to pull it off. 
Back studying aerospace engineering in college I was deeply impressed as I learned what it took for the Wright brothers to get airborne. I suppose many people just assume they were a couple talented grease monkeys in their bicycle shop who got lucky. In fact they were anything but.
The existing published literature on aeronautics was badly flawed, to the point that they had to build their own wind tunnel and conduct their own baseline experiments to reproduce a more accurate foundation for aerospace engineering. They had to solve problems that no one had ever solved before. They came up with key insights that the "great" minds before them had totally missed - such as the insight that a propeller is simply a wing mounted vertically, such that the lift it generates rotating through the air becomes thrust pulling the aircraft forward. This, along with their experimental data, allowed them to move past the naval propeller designs to the dramatically more effective propellers that got them airborne.
My point in this digression is that Satoshi's achievement is of a similar magnitude. Many people had come up with "digital cash" schemes that failed miserably (or more torturously and slowly) - akin to those silly old movie clips of people jumping off barns with wings strapped on. Satoshi had to work through all the failed ideas, identify the key ideas that did work, refine and re-engineer them, and compile them all together into a working whole that did not have even one single fatal flaw in it. 
Would someone else have done this eventually? I think so. But it was a non-trivial effort, and I suspect a few decades might have passed otherwise, or at least until the next financial crisis incentivized the small band of qualified cryptographers out there to make the effort.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:56
Yes; the point of the fork would have to be carefully considered given the exact circumstances of the attack.
One nice thing is that since the blockchain is fully transparent it is possible for exchanges and other entities to unwind transactions that may have happened post-fork, limiting the mayhem. This happened on Vericoin a few years ago after a hacker stole 30% of all Vericoin in existence from Mintpal, forcing just such a rollback.

1. That's a risk miners take. It should incentivize them to not collude in any such attacks at any rate.
2. This depends on the new algorithm and how easily people can get involved mining it. There's no direct relationship between hashrates of different algorithms; 1 megahash on one algorithm is more secure than 100 petahash on another if the former is distributed between 100 participants equally and the latter has only 3 miners on it. 
So what would be needed is a change to a PoW algorithm that would allow a lot of people to get involved with mining immediately, but which the government or other attacker could not easily overwhelm. Actually, until ASICs could be designed for it any new algorithm is going to be GPU or CPU based anyway, so I'm not sure it makes much of a difference.
But with the awareness of an attacker out there it might be necessary to keep changing algorithms to prevent them from designing and building ASICs for the new algorithm. That's why I favor a policy of semi-frequent PoW changes just as a matter of course. (With the caveat that I think we need a solution to botnets first, and I don't see a good one yet.)
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:31:31
And smarter people understand that the hash rate will follow the value, not the other way around. It's all just empty posturing at this point. Remember back in ~June when the anti-SW people kept insisting that the lack of hashrate committed to the UASF meant SW would never be implemented?

Central bankers in general are against bitcoin for the same reason postmasters were not too keen about email.
Goldbugs see Bitcoin as competition, though I would argue they are dramatically different in key ways. But both assets are seen as a hedge against fiat inflation and a safe haven in case of fiat collapse.
Some law enforcement is concerned about crime using bitcoin, though that is a complex topic. And some older folks will never adopt crypto because they are content with what they have and suspicious of anything risky. 
I suspect (though I don't have hard data) that nanny-state (big government) advocates in general are hostile to crypto because it undermines the power of the state and the ability of the state to maximize its confiscation of people's wealth.
Pretty much everyone else is either neutral/unaware or positively inclined to the benefits of cryptocurrency.

You can judge what fee to set by studying this: 
Most wallets let you set the fee manually one way or another. Be careful not to fat-finger it!
Fees go to the miner(s) that mine the block including your TX. Once all bitcoins have been mined this is how miners will be motivated to keep mining and secure the network. Miners generally choose the TX waiting in the mempool that give them the most profit, so you want to set your fee high enough to be selected for inclusion, without being wasteful.

Segwit2X is a 2-part agreement to enable (1) Segregated Witness, which provided limited scaling and is the best way to enable massive offchain scaling through what is known as the Lightning Network. And (2) to double the maximum block size to also improve scaling. The first part was achieved in August, the second is planned for mid-November.
Segwit2X is the brainchild of investor Barry Silbert and was pushed in what is called the New York Agreement via Bitcoin-related businesses he controls, some other businesses such as Shapeshift and Coinbase, and most miners. It was an attempt to save face by adopting Segwit before it was forced on the miners (who had fought it for a long time) via a user-activated soft fork (UASF).
The debate now is over the 2X block size increase, and whether it is legitimate for a self-interested faction of the entire bitcoin ecosystem to force a change on everyone. The 2X change provides scaling, but this is no longer needed in the near term thanks to SW and the expectation of LN improvements. It encourages centralization due to the increased costs associated with larger block sizes, a risk that is underappreciated by many. 
But it's the issue of governance that is perhaps the most objectionable. It represents an attempted usurpation, and lack of wisdom in fighting literally the entire core development team that has rejected the 2X hardfork as a bad idea. The way it is being done by the NYA group is exceptionally hostile and aggressive, indicating contempt for users concerned with the downsides or risks of the hardfork. For further reading:

1/100,000,000 currently (1 satoshi). But this can be changed with a painless soft fork. And some exchanges, I've noticed, already track it to more decimal places.

You could talk to Broad Financial about it. They handle self-directed IRAs where they work with Madison Trust to create an LLC for customers. The customer then invests their money into their own LLC and deploys it however they wish. No reason it couldn't be done with non-retirement funds as well. 
Unfortunately I can't give any guidance as far as taxes and liabilities and so forth. I figure one of these days someone might try to throw money at me just as your boss is doing, but I don't have the first clue where to start and would be scared to death of running afoul of a law (or 50), or how to handle disputes and so forth.

Miners do not decide (despite some delusions on this point). They either mine what is more profitable or go out of business. That means that regardless of what they say they are going to signal for, when push comes to shove they will mine the more highly valued coin. We saw this (and still are seeing it) with the BCH fork.
Bitfinex futures show Bitcoin at 3X the value of the B2X fork (what you call Seg2). Even Coinbase, an NYA signer, is hedging it's bets. Bitcoin.org is practically breathing fire and brimstone against B2X, and not a single Bitcoin community dev favors it (
So I'm not exactly worried that B2X will destroy Bitcoin. On the contrary it is a pointless compromise between BCH and BTC, fighting a 2-front war it is destined to lose. The only question is whether it will even happen at this point, or will they put it out of its agony now.

There is no evidence it is "the natural state of mind". I've seen reference to studies even in non-monotheistic cultures in which children instinctively recognize a Creator. Atheism itself correlates with societies in which there is an aggressive indoctrination system in the schools pushing it. (Such as Communist states and now in many western societies). And once that external and aggressive force is removed atheism begins to fade, as we see in the former Communist states, or the tendency of people to abandon atheism once they graduate.
One other noteworthy factor is the lack of a father figure or an abusive father figure, leading to hostility towards God as the ultimate father figure. I'm very sorry if you fall into this category, and hope you can look beyond it to God who loves you.

1. Belief in the technology/early adopters/gain access to new market (bitcoin users).
2. No chargebacks to deal with.

4. No counterfeits to worry about.
5. Near instant confirmations/settlement compared to checks and credit cards.
6. Lower fees than credit cards.
7. No need for armored cars/security guards to transport cash proceeds.
8. The volatility has been more up than down - very roughly .2% or .3% up daily over the last year, for example. That's a nice "risk" to bear if you are slow about converting it back to fiat.
What else have I missed?
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:01:38
I think you might have the best take on this. If the fork becomes contentious and the market tanks badly for (core) BTC, without B2X showing significant growth, that will be a sign to an independent miners that they are risking a train wreck. 
But they should be able to see this already with the futures markets, so why are more not shifting away from signaling NYA already?

Which bit do you need an explanation of?
Total bitcoins is how many have been mined out of the ~21 million ultimate total.
Height is how many blocks there are in the blockchain.
Difficulty is a reflection of how much mining hashpower is on the network. The difficulty adjusts up or down every 2016 blocks to recalibrate to a target of 10 minute blocks (on average).
# of blocks mined - 144 would be 1 block/10 minutes. In practice this usually runs high due to the growth of mining hashpower over time, which means halvenings happen a bit faster than the 4 years people usually state.
Bitcoins output - how many BTC have been sent in TX on the blockchain for the day.
Fees - how much miners have earned from Bitcoin transactions in addition to the 12.5 BTC/block reward of new coins.
Average time - self-explanatory.
Hashrate - Estimate of how much mining firepower is deployed for mining Bitcoin.
Price - self-explanatory.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:31:04

They are down under 85%. There's no magic number at which which they announce the fork will be abandoned. But at this point we can say that even if the 85% swore a blood oath to keep mining B2X, the 15% would be enough to keep producing a block an hour on Bitcoin. It would take ~6 weeks at that rate to reach the next difficulty adjustment (which is 1152 blocks after the fork).
But realistically more hashpower will peel off rather than mine an altcoin with only 13-15% the price of Bitcoin. In a standoff between users and miners, users win because we don't have power bills to pay while we wait for the other side to blink.
Once miners started switching the B2X price would tank further and remaining miners would face that much more pressure to accept the inevitable. I don't think miners will even start mining B2X at this point if the fork happens, but even if they make a go of it I expect it to fall apart in a matter of days. All we need to do is hold firm supporting Bitcoin and not buying into B2X.

It seems very experimental at this point. I have some Byteball just in case it turns out a better approach than blockchains, but I'd like to see a lot more testing and application before feeling comfortable that it is the future.
I confess I have a hard time understanding DAG as well. There hasn't been a lot that explains the system/network and where transactions and a transaction history actually reside if there is no blockchain. What do we lose or gain in terms of what block explorers (or the DAG equivalent) can show in a DAG currency verses a blockchain for example? How does anonymity (such as Blackbytes) work compared to Zcash/Monero/Dash/etc.?

I know they are "NYA" signalling, but common sense says they are not going to mine for a small fraction of the revenue they can get staying on Bitcoin.
Keep in mind there is no EDA, and over 1100 blocks from the fork to the next difficulty adjustment. Current futures place B2x at ~15% of the value of Bitcoin. That's a huge financial hit for the miners to take. And if other miners stay with Bitcoin, the ones who sacrifice to support B2X have to suffer that much longer before they can turn a profit again.
And if they do win by sticking together and mining B2X and destroy the Bitcoin chain, what have they accomplished? The market has clearly demonstrated they want to stay with Core. The NYA team can destroy Bitcoin, but they can't ride it to the moon. If they destroy the Core fork the rest of us leave crypto or switch to Litecoin or other cryptos, and they will have just destroyed their businesses and mining investments. Not exactly a smart move, though there is plenty of precedent for such hubris in history.

Evidence? Or if you don't have evidence, let's try logic. What logical reason would there be for anyone in the user community to favor the 2X HF?
1. Fees are back down since SW activated.
2. Dozens of devs vs. what, 1?
3. Passive aggressive coding to harm/destroy the legacy blockchain while subverting attempts to defend it.
4. Company after company abandoning the NYA. Zero companies signing on in reverse.
5. No announced support from exchanges outside the NYA (beyond a few saying they'll list B2X as an altcoin).
6. Absence of articles in news media regarding B2X as the replacement Bitcoin or explaining why it should be adopted.
7. NYA support concentrated among known bad actors in mining and business community.
8. Big blockers already have BCH, which broke need for and purpose of the NYA anyway.
I just do not see any reason why anyone would imagine there is a silent hidden pool of Bitcoin supporters who will give B2X the time of day, much less outright favor it.

Well, merchants who accept BTC don't have to worry about counterfeit cash, or bounced checks, or credit card fees, or chargebacks, or long delays depositing and moving their funds where they want.

Yes, at this point you just need to be patient. If you aren't seeing it because you are syncing the blockchain that makes sense. Even if your wallet file is properly loaded Core may not show it until the sync is complete, and there's a lot to download if you are years behind.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:14:36
The price is set by how the market (that is, all of us) values each set of coins. 
You can get some idea of the value by examining the futures market on Bitfinex, where we are already trading tokens that will be converted into Bitcoin and B2X coins when/if the fork happens. 
Keep in mind that the limited volumes on Bitfinex means the minority coin can be propped up better with limited resources than it will once it is being traded heavily everywhere after the fork. That's probably why the BT2 token (B2X) is still around .25 BTC when Bitcoin Cash is down to a third of that in general trading.

Over time tulips are not very scarce in the sense that they could be produced in greater and greater numbers. So even if demand had stayed high, at some point lovers of unique tulips would have been awash in tulips to pick from, and prices would have crashed.
Bitcoin truly is scarce, and while a bubble is possible, you cannot judge whether it is in a bubble by looking in the rear-view mirror at past performance. It is the _future potential_ that you need to evaluate in order to gauge whether it is in a bubble.
If Bitcoin really is "digital gold" and a platform for future securities markets, smart contracts, digital cash and more, then its future value is astronomically higher than the current value. So instead of judging it by how much it has gone up, it makes more sense to judge it by how far it has to go.

The language in their announcement is confusing because it says "withdrawals" will be turned off on November 9, but also says we won't be able to make new loans on that date. One would expect that they'd shut off our ability to offer loans way earlier than Nov. 9 if their intent is to bar us from withdrawing on Nov. 9!

This is not true, not if you make an effort and aren't lazy about your security.
Suffice to say without going into details, if someone kidnaps me expecting me to know my passwords for any significant accounts, it doesn't matter how much they beat me or whether I give in. They are going to fail in their aim because I won't be able to help them.
For people facing this kind of credible threat, it should not be too difficult for them to think this through and arrive at similar solutions. It's not pretty, and it may not save you from torture. But it will frustrate the criminals from their aims, keep your funds safe, and maybe save the next guy who would have been kidnapped if they had been successful with you.

I favor the store of value function, and I would argue that we should not try to make one cryptocurrency serve both functions. Currencies are meant to be used, which means a high velocity (rate at which money changes hands), compared to a store of value that is mostly HODL'd.
Velocity has a direct impact on the price of a given currency/asset (higher velocity = lower value; during hyperinflation the skyrocketing velocity directly plays into the constant loss of value of a currency). So someone using a crypto as a store of value will want it to NOT be used as a currency because that results in a lower value. 
Let Bitcoin, as the crypto flagship, be a pre-eminent store of value. But because usage as a currency will degrade that function we need to let other cryptos - Litecoin, Dash and so on - step up to serve the role of a daily currency. (With atomic swaps Litecoin may be well suited to be a daily currency joined to BTC's store of value function).
I realize this is controversial because so many Bitcoiners keep pushing for it to be used as a currency to encourage mainstream adoption. But the laws of economics say otherwise, and will not be denied.

I've never thought about this before, but currently it is said that the last satoshi will be mined around 2140. But if we need to add more decimal places to Bitcoin as it grows in value, wouldn't that extended the duration before the "last bitcoin" is completely mined out?
In other words, right now around 2140 miners will get .00000001 BTC per block reward. But add a couple more decimal places (down to, say, milli-satoshis) and the reward could drop to .000000005, then .0000000025 and so on. Kind of silly since fees will presumably be much more, but it means the oft-repeated declaration that "the last bitcoin will be mined by 2140" may not be precisely accurate.

I just got started with a self-directed IRA through Broad Financial. I'd suggest you look into it as it was better than some other options I looked at. You get complete control over your funds. 
Basically you get set up as the owner of your own investment company, and the custodian of your IRA mails you a check from your own IRA. Then you can do whatever you want with it, in line with the legal restrictions on what can be in an IRA. I can literally sink my whole IRA into Piggycoin if I want to at this point, and there is nothing to stop me.

Show us your math. Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, which takes 14 days at static 10 minute block times. Worst case they shut down the miners abruptly just after a difficulty adjustment, leaving non-Chinese hashrate to struggle thru the next 2016 blocks. 
Let's say China controls 75% of hashrate (inferred from  (EDIT: Looks more like 65%:  This means that if ZERO hashrate were transfered out of country or produced in the interim, it would only take 8 weeks (EDIT: 6 weeks) to reach the next difficulty adjustment, at which point it would be fully fixed.
In reality it's likely China would allow for the export of mining hardware (if outsiders buy them it means more $$$ flowing into Chinese coffers), or allow Chinese miners to take their equipment and set up shop across a border. Worst case smugglers move hardware out to start bootleg mines. 
Likewise, there are mining hardware producers outside China, and they'd be producing at full capacity in this scenario. (Not to mention the new Japanese efforts might be accelerated). So I think the 8 week "worst case" is unrealistic. Probably it would be no more than a month of 20 minute blocks. Not a big deal with segwit already making an impact.

Mining bitcoin is legal almost anywhere (with maybe a few obscure exceptions like Venezuela). But you need specialized hardware and free/cheap electricity. 
As far as investing it goes, holding bitcoin itself is an investment at this point. Just keep your wallet safe and secure. Note that blockchain.info is an online wallet. For small amounts of bitcoin that's practical, but for larger amounts you will want to secure your bitcoin under your own control on a mobile, desktop or paper wallet, or even a hardware wallet. See

It actually depends on the pool and their policy. For a long time I assumed the miners got the fees, but I ran across an article a month or two ago spelling it out, and I was stunned to learn that an awful lot of the pools were still, despite the huge rise in fees, not sharing the fees with miners. I expect that will change, maybe did change in the aftermath of that media coverage, but maybe not.

These are excellent questions. There has been a lot of discussion on each around here, on Bitcointalk, etc. and probably more in Github.

But I'd like it to happen on a non-emergency basis and be planned out with ample time. I'd also like to see consensus (apart from existing miners for obvious reasons).

My letter to Coinbase:
Hi, I'm concerned about an apparent contradiction in the latest Coinbase post on the threatened hard fork in November (
The statement contains the following:
1. "We are going to call the chain with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin."
2. "We believe that letting the market decide..."
The first statement refers to the preferences of miners. The second refers to the general market of all bitcoin users. The miners are a self-interested faction and should not unilaterally define or control bitcoin. 
It is obvious comparing mining NYA signaling with the futures markets at Bitfinex, Huobi, HitBTC, etc.) that the market preferences do not align with the miners preferences, creating a contradiction in your post.
Please resolve it (and the confusion of us customers) by specifying that the fork with the sustained higher price should be considered "Bitcoin." (In time it should be expected that miners will gravitate to that fork anyway, resolving the contradiction.) This will let us know that you are truly letting the market decide rather than trying to force something on us against our will.

It is humans that assign Bitcoin value. More specifically it is humans who buy bitcoin who give it value, as distinct from, say, the humans who mine it. So the humans who mine it must keep the humans who buy it happy, or the miners are wasting their time and money.
In this case the humans who buy bitcoin have strongly demonstrated through every available means - polls/surveys, dominance on forums, twitter, futures markets, news media, nodes - that they decisively reject your proposed hardfork. 
You can play the ideological fanatic and insist that Bitcoin is whatever the miners make it, but at the end of the day you'll just be mining a worthless altcoin if you don't follow the market.

I am curious about your logic. Why would you prefer to transact with a currency that:
1. Is centrally controlled by a small group.
2. Is constantly being deflated in value.
3. Is backed by nothing. ("The US government" means nothing. You can't get gold or silver or anything else for dollars since they delinked it.)
4. Is easily counterfeited.
5. Is expensive to transact with, being burdened with constant need for regulation and audits and other cross-checking due to the lack of a common, cryptographically secured ledger.
6. Takes hours or days to move between accounts due to  compared to seconds for crypto like Nano or Bitcoin with the LN.
Notice that none of the six concerns are theoretical, they are all quite practical and proven problems that have already been solved by cryptocurrencies. Nor are they minor issues. You can naysay, but the average person will be steadily won over by these sorts of comparisons, just as I once was. 
And this doesn't even get into advantages like smart contracts, optimization for manifold financial niches by hundreds of cryptocurrencies, tokens designed for ease of auditing, tokens designed for privacy, and so on. 20th century fiat currency can't hope to compete in this space any more than a Model T can go up against a Tesla.

If you have a bank account you can transfer fiat to Coinbase for 0%, then shift it to GDAX for free, then list a Maker order for 0%. You literally do the conversion for free.
So the issue is with the conversion back to fiat in target countries. But as bitcoin grows there will be more opportunities to spend it directly, and more competition and more branches of organizations that will convert it back to fiat efficiently. If Coinbase can do it one way for free I expect that ultimately the reverse will be true as well.

This is one of the best articles on this subject that I've read. The one improvement I would suggest is to spend more time on the subject of preventing accidental loss of your keys (or password). You do have one brief line on doing backups, but it's easily missed and needs to be expanded upon, since it's probably a problem on a similar scale to hacking/theft.
In particular I'd emphasize that backups should not all be under one roof. They should be geographically distributed so that no one disaster can take them all out. That may mean some kind of cloud backup (and how to best secure that!) And since a disaster that destroys some of your backups may well take your life, a bitcoin user should spend some thought on how their  loved ones will know about and be able to retrieve those backups. (I do like the explanation of M of N solutions for distributing keys/passwords.)

The next Byteball airdrop is Nov. 4. However they have cut back the airdrop to 1 Gbyte of byteball for every 160 BTC you hold in a wallet, which is not a huge amount (though maybe still worth the trouble). You get a 10% bonus on your existing Byteball though, so it's worth holding onto if you have some. 
I think they were trying to reach the whole bitcoin userbase with their earlier airdrops (to take advantage of Metcalfe's Law), while the current/next ones are designed more to get people to Hodl their byteball and boost the value.

Which bit do you need an explanation of?
Total bitcoins is how many have been mined out of the ~21 million ultimate total.
Height is how many blocks there are in the blockchain.
Difficulty is a reflection of how much mining hashpower is on the network. The difficulty adjusts up or down every 2016 blocks to recalibrate to a target of 10 minute blocks (on average).
Number of blocks mined - 144 would be 1 block/10 minutes. In practice this usually runs high due to the growth of mining hashpower over time, which means halvenings happen a bit faster than the 4 years people usually state.
Bitcoins output - how many BTC have been sent in TX on the blockchain for the day.
Fees - how much miners have earned from Bitcoin transactions in addition to the 12.5 BTC/block reward of new coins.
Average time - self-explanatory.
Hashrate - Estimate of how much mining firepower is deployed for mining Bitcoin.
Price - self-explanatory.

And calling it dumb when it is very well laid out with a multitude of good points is just stupid when it's obvious the author is unable to contest the points. Lamely complaining that the manifesto authors are not core developers is ridiculous. Throwing in red herrings like Bitcoin Gold doesn't rebut a single line of the manifesto. Reading through it, this response is literally just a pointless whine.

Something is in a bubble if it is far exceeding its value. How did you determine it's value?
I disagree with the notion that extreme volatility prevents it being used as a store of wealth. It's been an excellent store of wealth for us, because that "volatility" has mostly been up. Way up.
Amazon could hold BTC, same as Overstock, and reap the benefits like Overstock does.
Check out Purse.io sometime if you think we aren't shopping at Amazon all the time with BTC.
Volatility matters little if the method of exchange allows for rapid exchanges around the world in a matter of minutes.

Nope, no option for setting fees because GDAX pays the fees. You should see the coin(s) incoming after a couple confirmations (anywhere from a couple minutes to an hour or two). You can monitor this at Blockchain.info or other sites by searching for the TX ID (if you have it), or simply the public key you are sending to, and seeing what comes up.

It was obvious - people sold off alts for days leading up to the BTG fork. Now it's done and people are shifting funds back to the alts for a week or two at least until the next fork, if it isn't canceled.

Well said. One nice thing about this approach is they are developing a lifestyle that is not dependent on a high income to maintain. When people live like this as a baseline for long enough it becomes easier to cope with an influx of wealth because they don't feel pressure to spend to meet artificial "needs" or imagine that blowing a wad of cash on luxuries will make them feel better.
This will be especially helpful to the kids if they learn to be content without a lot of expensive toys. Tolkien once had someone say of Gimli something like "May your hands overflow with gold, but may gold have no power over you." Hopefully they get the chance to live that out.

Coinmarketcap.com will give you an idea what's out there. I haven't mined since the end of 2014 so I'm not much help, but in general if you have good GPUs (one is probably not worth the bother) and reasonable electric rates you can earn a little bit of income. Be careful not to overclock too hard or you'll burn out your GPUs like I did.
I'm sure there are how-to sites out there on building a rig, finding the right mining software for the coin(s) you want to mine and so forth. You will need to be comfortable messing with configuration files and settings for best results. 
I'd say it's fun as a hobby, and any profit is icing on the cake.

Absolutely, and good question. Bitcoin only really exists on the blockchain in the form of a ledger entry tied to your public key - which in turn can only be spent by proving you hold the corresponding private key. That is all the "wallet" really is - a tool for making transactions on the blockchain. Shut your computer down and life goes on at the thousands of nodes hosting copies of the blockchain recording your transactions.
Once you've broadcast your transaction out to other nodes and it's part of what is known as the mempool - a collection of all the transactions awaiting inclusion in a new block - it doesn't matter what you do.  You can't cancel it or lose it at that point. (You could attempt a double-spend on it, but let's not get into that.)
And if your transaction didn't make it onto a block for some reason - say for having no miners' fee - after a week or less it would be dropped from the mempool and the bitcoin you attempted to spend would show up available in your wallet again.

"Meanwhile, even if they adhere to the policy, it would needlessly bloat Bitcoin's UTXO set... it is an unambiguously hostile, disingenuous approach that doesn't really meaningfully represent actual replay protection."
Thus my comment on github that it should be incumbent on the innovator to provide full replay protection rather than burdening the legacy chain. If their fork survives they have absolutely no basis to complain in the future when every 2-bit altcoin project comes along forking off of them and doing the same thing to them (while scammers wait to prey upon their userbase the minute they slip up).

For every bitcoin purchased to get into altcoins, you then have to sell that same bitcoin to finish the process. So it is pretty much a neutral effect, except that someone money at any given moment in time is in the transition. So this "pipeline" effect pump exists, but is not huge.
Besides, it is possible to buy a number of the major alts directly, such as Ethereum and Litecoin at Coinbase. I think Dash and a number of others also have fiat gateways.

@_date: 2017-10-27 20:05:07
Coin.dance/blocks is showing few blocks being mined. I assumed it was the BCH EDA but their block rate looks pretty normal too.
I think a difficulty adjustment just hit because someone mentioned a 21% jump. That would reset the block rate to "normal" at 10 minutes, but if a lot of that new hashrate disappeared again it could explain this.
  is showing a big jump in TX waiting in the mempool, which no doubt means a spike in fees as well, caused by the slowdown in blocks.
This may be just the bad side of some random variance, or it could be hashrate going away. Any data/insights on the latter from anyone?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:46:28
If interest holds and institutional gateways continue to open, yes. At the latest the next halvening in 2020 will tighten up the growth in the supply of new bitcoins and that will drive the price higher.

is the refuge of a wide array of bitcoin discontents and disgruntled sorts of every stripe. Conspiracy theorists that hate the "core" development team, people who can't stand that their pet idea was implemented, gullible sorts who think Craig Wright is Satoshi (!), malicious trolls and so forth. And they are manipulated by Roger Ver (memorydealers) and Jihan Wu (owner of Bitmain) and their mining cartel into blocking anything that provides off-chain scaling on Bitcoin, since that reduces the control of the miners. Bitcoin Cash is their brainchild (used to eke out more profits from ASICBoost), and the NYA fork would put Bitcoin under their control as well.
I could deluge you with links and articles along these lines, but if you just keep your eyes open you'll see the point easily enough.
Bitcoin Cash doesn't have Segwit as that provides for offchain scaling via the Lightning Network, nor does it  have the fixes and improvements implemented on Bitcoin on 0.15 since it has no development team to speak of. 
It's not really a competitor in the long run but they've spoken often of pumping it ahead of the Bitcoin fork in a wild effort to supplant Bitcoin. Without development and off-chain scaling it's already a bit of a dinosaur, and under  centralized control there's just no reason to trust it.

If they really are meaning to attack bitcoin they won't care. But I think they'd only do that if they were rooting for BCH, or were under the control of the Chinese government (miners). I guess I can't rule those out, but that's not my read of things at this point.
So I think if they saw the futures market for B2X tank while Core BTC held up, they'd realize the futility of what they are doing. Conversely if Core BTC does poorly in futures trading I'll be very surprised - and be picking Zcash or Litecoin or something for future use. I won't tolerate a NYA takeover of BTC.

They are going to get an earful from me. I can't believe it. Coinbase is actually beating them in their handling of the fork.
"We have decided to use this existing policy for the upcoming hard fork, and we will be measuring total cumulative computational difficulty of the blockchain to determine what we will call Bitcoin and BTC and on the Gemini platform."
That's going to look really stupid for them if the hashrate oscillates wildly and switches back and forth immediately after the fork. Could they possibly have made a worse decision? If they had announced B2X was Bitcoin at least people would know what to expect. Now people literally won't be able to tell what they are getting on Gemini without tracking hashrate on another screen (and hoping Gemini is tracking it the same way).

November 8? Oh wow. 
Edit: I'm having a hard time believing that. 2882 blocks to go as I write, but I know offhand that difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, and this is supposed to take 14 days at 10 minute blocks. So unless there is a huge surge in hashrate right after the next difficulty adjustment I don't see how it can hit that date.
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:29:41
Nope. This is meaningless signaling. Far more relevant is the futures market on Bitfinex that shows the relative value of BTC to B2X. 
B2X is currently worth just under 1/3 the value of BTC, which means miners will earn only 1/3 as much if they mine it after the fork. We already know from BCH that miners will mine the most profitable chain. And that means that without an EDA the B2X fork will go into a vicious circle of slow blocks from lack of miners, causing the price to decline, driving miners away and leading to slower blocks and so on.

With the BCH EDA kicking in and out the math is quite a bit harder to work out. Under normal conditions a 94 minute block is unusual (though not astronomically so). With hashpower jumping to BCH for the EDA it's going to be more commonplace depending on just how much hashrate jumps off BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-01 05:18:30
Yes, but.... 
1. Make sure you learn all about Replay attacks and how to deal with them, or you'll be losing coins real fast. (
2. Keep in mind the goal of the NYA folks is the absolute destruction of Bitcoin and the forced replacement of it with their B2X chain. So you might buy BTC only to have it nuked by the NYA effort, losing that portion of your investment.
3. Likewise, I expect many of us on the Bitcoin side will be targeting the weak node infrastructure of the NYA effort. This could leave you unable to make transactions with the B2X coin. You could buy "cheap" on one exchange, than be stymied trying to move them to a "better" exchange. By the time they arrive the obvious problems experienced may well have tanked the price there too. 
Besides, if what I saw on the BCH fork is any guide, you'll be literally in a race down to the millisecond with many other people doing the same thing. Each block processed will find you in a mad dash with dozens of other traders to dump your coin on your target exchange when it arrives, because others will be seeing the same thing as you. If you aren't using a bot I don't see how you can win, and even then it will be dicey.
I'm not saying there won't be opportunities, but exploiting them without getting hurt will be challenging and risky. I've considered it and at this point I intend to just stay on the sidelines.

Thousands. Because there are thousands of different financial niches to be exploited. 
Stop imagining that one coin can or will do it all. That's like saying that the only form of currency we need are nickels. No quarters, pennies, dollar bills, and goodness no checks, credit cards, debit cards, wire transfers, smart contracts, futures markets, etc., etc.

Back at the start of August we had the BCH hardfork. BCH peaked at around .3 BTC, which means anyone fortunate enough to sell their free BCH got a bonus of 30% on their bitcoin investment at that point. 
So now people are looking ahead to the B2X hardfork in November and expecting a repeat. I'm skeptical. Reasons:
1. Big-blocker dissidents holding BCH have been burned and are not likely (or financially able) to repeat their mistake.
2. Bitfinex shows the B2X fork has weak economic support, with the B2X token (BT2) trading at .25 BTC or less currently. It is easier to prop it up in a limited futures market compared to when trading opens everywhere for it (if you look at the depth chart it's clear a few whale orders have been propping the price on BT2, and suppressing BT1, for the past week). So if you want a big windfall, you should be acting now on Bitfinex with the futures market, not waiting until the general dump in November after the fork.
3. Even if there is no deterioration between now and the fork, Miners will earn only 1/3 as much on B2X compared to Bitcoin after the fork. Without an EDA there will be no reason to mine it until after a difficulty adjustment. So expect blocks to be terribly slow on B2X, and B2X will be insecure and vulnerable to a 51% attack. Both these issues will weigh heavily on the price, making both problems worse.
4. The NYA backers face boycotts or worse if they do continue to conduct a "takeover" attempt on Bitcoin. Since they are mostly businesses that should want to survive, the cost of supporting a contentious fork is very high. Already a number of businesses have pulled out; each further pullout will increase the pressure on the remaining backers. 
TL/DR: I am now expecting the B2X fork will probably be abandoned as too much of a risk for the supporting companies. If it does survive to launch the price is likely to be much lower than BCH reached, so there is much less reason to dump alts just to hold Bitcoin for the B2X windfall. On the contrary this may be a smart time to stock up on depressed alts, if you don't care to hoard BT1 tokens while you can.

ASIC development costs a fair bit of money, so it is a barrier to entry and as such it is inherently centralizing.

The market is users (buyers and sellers of Bitcoin), not the exchanges (which merely enable the buying/selling)! Did you seriously think otherwise? jratcliffe's point is that if exchanges won't allow users to make the choice then they are usurping power from the free market.

It would but TX transmission times would be a pain and miners would not be able to mine from another planetary body (from where most miners are located) due to latency. 
What makes more sense is for every planetary body (and asteroid and satellite colonies, etc.) to have its own primary cryptocurrencies for everyday use. You could still send TX across to Earth-based (or other colony) blockchains, but the communication time would make it inconvenient for many purposes.

Why is everyone so concerned with whether the email is from Satoshi, while there is very little concern with whether the arguments in the email are valid or not?
Please folks, don't fall into idol-worship. If Satoshi reappears and proves himself he should not be followed blindly. If his arguments are good it matters little whether he makes them or a 12-yo autistic boy does; if they are bad then they are bad no matter who makes the argument.
(FWIW, I think the email is pretty reasonable in several ways. But even Satoshi doesn't have the authority to declare whether Bitcoin is a failed project or not, except in his own opinion.)

Don't do it folks. Standard scam is to buy someone's bitcoins then do a chargeback for the fiat. 
Paypal's effectively an accomplice in this scheme since they could easily require the public keys be shared with them before the TX to verify that it happened.

If Coinbase winds up supporting BTG by granting it to their customers they should have records of who owned BTC in their accounts at the exact time of the fork. You should get your BTG based on that record, and shouldn't need to keep your BTC there until Coinbase distributes it (which could be a _long_ time if their handling of BCH is any clue).

Very simply it just doubles the max blocksize from 4 MB to 8 MB, which would allow for twice as many transactions.
This has an array of downsides however, from latency issues (large blocks take longer to share globally) to growth of the UTXO. The overall effect is to make it more expensive and difficult to operate the nodes upon which Bitcoin depends. If people drop out of running nodes Bitcoin becomes more centralized, and more easily attacked or controlled by a hostile entity. 
Since Segwit activated there has been no need for greater scaling to handle transactions, and it is now apparent that past spikes were largely or entirely due to spam attacks from miners themselves.

Only one view of the world can be fully true. But even  views that are somewhat wrong can bring much good and don't deserve to be derided as a "cancer."
I support and volunteer with an organization that was founded by a man, Richard Wurmbrand, who was imprisoned and viciously tortured for 14 years by men who believe "religions are a cancer." When asked for evidence of his torture in a U.S. senate committee hearing, he responded by stripping to the waist.
Those who deride religion as a cancer have been the most vicious and evil in their self-righteous attempts to rid the world of their self-declared cancer. Millions have died and millions more suffer lives of oppression under their rule yet today. That's something for you to consider.
Besides, to call something a cancer implies a sense of good and evil. As the atheist C.S. Lewis came to realize, you cannot sustain the idea of good and evil except by acknowledging an authority and source for the standard of good/evil that has a will and transcends the universe. Otherwise it's just part of the universe and is itself meaningless. If there is no God, your negative opinion is just a meaningless result of deterministic atomic collisions and there is no reason for me or anyone else to acknowledge it.

I think they might be the only exchange signed on with the NYA (well, besides Shapeshift), so this puts them in a difficult position. They will get sued up the wazoo if B2X goes forward and replay attacks wreak havoc on Coinbase's user base. So an email like the OP speculates about makes perfect sense as a legal defense. I doubt it will hold up but it might help in an arbitration situation to tilt things a little bit.
It's still a dumb position they've put themselves in, and a better mass email would just be an announcement that they are following the other companies in pulling out of the NYA. With no exchanges it will be another nail in the coffin for B2X.

You can define literally anything as your standard frame of reference for value, and compare everything else to it. A dollar, a loaf of bread, an ounce of gold, or a bitcoin, etc.

It was always a zero-sum game in the end. That's why if you add the value of the BT1 and BT2 tokens on Bitfinex it's consistently been right at 1 Bitcoin. If this was going to be a "free money" scenario like with BCH the value of BT1 plus BT2 would be more than 1 bitcoin.

That is true. It's reasonable at this point to be hopeful, but not at all to be complacent. The key at this point is seeing miners abandon the NYA; until that happens we are not out of the woods no matter what polls, futures markets, business announcements or the state of BTC1 in github say.

My letter to Gemini support (I have an institutional account with them):
I was thunderstruck to read your blog post today on how you plan to handle the NYA hardfork effort in November. (
Contrary to virtually every other exchange out there you are saying you will potentially switch back and forth between separate chains in which one you call "Bitcoin." Even Coinbase - Coinbase! - got it right on this one, designating the NYA 2X chain "B2X."
It is not hard to envision scenarios where the hashrate could oscillate substantially as different factions make a variety of efforts to draw the greatest mining support in the days after the fork. If the miners hold together in supporting the NYA to begin it's downright likely you will be switching what you call "Bitcoin" twice - once at the fork and again after economic reality (as already reflected on the multiple futures markets at Bitfinex, HitBTC, Huobi and OK) forces them to switch back.
There is a serious error in the logic that leads you to define Bitcoin as the chain with the greatest proof of work. While technically simple and straightforward, it ignores the reality that Bitcoin only survives and thrives because it is useful as a store of value. The minute it becomes clear that Bitcoin is under the control of a self-interested faction (miners) against the clearly expressed wishes of the market consensus that confidence in Bitcoin is destroyed.
Please reconsider and provide a consistent naming scheme for the two forks through the period following the hardfork, one that meshes with the plans already being published by other exchanges and businesses insofar as possible.
Best wishes,

Speaking as someone not terribly technical I don't know that I would call this "easy". What happens when someone misinterprets this to mean that they need to manually put this blacklisted address into their "change address"  (after all, change addresses are for changes, right? I  could see someone thinking that.) So they send a TX and wind up dumping a big chunk of their BTC into this blacklisted address...
Which raises a question: Who controls that address and gets whatever BTC accumulates in it?

That would let everyone see the transaction on the blockchain. There are plenty of people here more skilled than I at interpreting it, but even I could likely spot the issue if there is anything odd about it. 
But basically if you have a TX ID and you can see your transaction on a site like Blockchain.info and it says confirmed, your bitcoin is moved. In that case your problem is solely with Coinbase/GDAX. If you can't come up with a TX ID or it shows as not confirmed on the blockchain then it means the coins have not moved, and you need to be talking to the service that's supposed to be sending it.
Edit: Just re-read your post - if Coinbase says they received it, either there was a bad case of orphaning (unlikely), or things are screwed up internally on their end (which, given their reputation...). The TX ID would helpful to rule out the former possibility.

Letting miners and/or businesses dictate what bitcoin is, opens the door to censorship and control of bitcoin. If we accept that a cartel or organized group of miners/businesses govern bitcoin, it will not be long before some government starts leaning on them to "fix" bitcoin according to their liking. Criminals, political dissidents, ICO entrepeneurs, taxpayers - whomever the government targets, will find themselves restricted or unable to utilize bitcoin. 
And not just governments - what about when the bitcoin cartel develops an agenda itself? What if a mafia organization puts a horse head in Barry Silbert's bed and "suggests" some adaptations to bitcoin?

Yep. But how many people uninformed enough to take BTG seriously will be informed enough to find a way to sell it? There's no sign BTG is even going to get listed on an exchange. Even if the scammers pay off some 4th-rate exchange to list it the price is going be near zero.
I guess if anyone is silly enough to try to sell BTG based on how things look now, it's quite likely they will be subject to a replay attack. That may be the whole point of this exercise from the scammers' viewpoint.

Not much chance of that at this point. Sure it's a risk but well worth the odds. You can still multiply your BTC by around 22% by splitting it for the tokens and repeatedly dumping the BT2 tokens and buying more BT1 with the proceeds.

No, at least not until 1-2 difficulty adjustments. Lacking an EDA the miners who go with the less valued chain will earn proportionately less, irregardless of the time to mine each block. And if they keep piling onto B2X and refusing to mine BTC despite the price staying skewed in favor of BTC, after the difficulty adjustments they'd still face the same situation of earning only a fraction of the revenue they'd earn on BTC.
The bottom line is that miners must follow value or they are throwing away revenue. The only exception is something like an EDA that pulls forward miners' profits at the expense of earlier halvenings (thus cutting into profits in the future).

Whoever told you it's up to the incumbent devs to do something is an idiot. (Remind me to announce I'm forking off BCH and they'd better implement replay protection as I've no idea what I'm doing.)
Garzik almost implemented a poorly conceived opt-in replay protection that would have put the burden on Bitcoin core users rather than on anyone using B2X. It got pulled back after a Core dev pointed out it would have caused B2X problems with LN implementation. Since then they've apparently decided against any replay protection at all. I see nothing to the contrary when I poke around in their github.

If it is a random sample several hundred responses will give an accurate answer to within a few percent. In other words a 97% support rate may reflect a real rate of 99% or 94%, but it's not going to turn out that the real rate was only 40% with a sample that large. 
It all hinges on whether the sample is skewed compared to the overall population. If it's skewed then the results will be off regardless of whether it was 0.1% or 10% that was sampled.

1. Cryptographic/QC breakthroughs make all conceivable cryptographic algorithms insecure (not likely).
2. A powerful nation-state somehow buys up Bitcoin en masse and somehow (I can't figure out how) turns most Bitcoin owners into Bitcoin debtors. If the average Bitcoin user _owes_ bitcoin rather than owning it, it becomes to their advantage to reduce the value of Bitcoin. Thus the community would be incentivized to reduce or destroy the value of bitcoin (such as by agreeing to increase the 21 million Bitcoin cap). I can't figure a realistic way this scenario could come to pass.
3. Nanotech camera/sensor drones with wifi become commonplace, such that basically everyone is under surveillance by someone such that you can't log into anything without a drone recording it. (Including biometric info, 2FA etc.) 
This is an "out there" problem but I rate it as somewhat more plausible based on current trends. A world in which someone, or multiple someones, is ALWAYS watching and you have no privacy short of extreme safeguards. The "good" news in this case is that everything that relies on security will be compromised, not just bitcoin. We'd be back to trading lumps of shiny metal or something.

Yes, AFAIK a given wallet will have one private key for all the public keys tied to it. Unless you've created multiple keys manually or imported keys or something unusual. If you can get your private key from this software you should be able to import it in Electrum or any other wallet that handles importing of keys.

It has nothing to do with miners. A replay attack simply posts the transaction you intended for one chain onto the other chain, such that both your Chain1 and Chain2 coins go to the recipient (when you only intended to pay them on Chain1). The recipient can do this, any random vandal who can see TX (which is everybody) can do this, or it can (and probably will if not prevented)) happen by accident as TX "leak" from one fork to the other via connected nodes.

That's why a good option for some not-highly-technical people (like me) may be to split their BTC into BT1 and BT2 on Bitfinex, dump the BT2, and just hold BT1 there thru any fork. Bitfinex seems to have an excellent handle on the situation (their announcements on the subject set a high bar for other exchanges to match) and I trust they won't lose any coins through replay attacks insofar as their exchange is concerned.
I think the remaining NYA supporters are in an extremely difficult situation right now.  It's clear they are a minority fork, and miners will earn only 1/3 as much on B2X even assuming no further price deterioration, for weeks/months after the fork. So the only hashrate that will have is from the fanatical hardcore support, not the general market of miners no matter how many are signaling "NYA". Plus the NYA companies are facing boycotts if they proceed, and that will only intensify as people lose money due to the lousy replay protection (or lack thereof) they are offering. Having extremely slow blocks won't exactly help with their post-fork price either.
If they cancel  the B2X fork now they can avoid the boycotts, possible lawsuits, lost investments trying to prop up B2X and be positioned for the surge in BTC growth that will result. So I think it very likely (just going by logic) that they should be close to abandoning the fork soon. The alternative is quite likely a lot of NYA companies may outright fold. Is the fork really worth that much risk to them? In which case those of us who dumped BT2 early are the big winners.

Bitcoin has no reason to go to 0 and is growing by leaps and bounds over its 9 year lifespan. Once we have scalability and convenient payment systems, why would anyone prefer dollars or euro or pounds to bitcoin?
Government currencies must be constantly inflated to reduce the debt burden of their host governments. When this gets out of hand you get hyperinflation and the death of that currency. It's happened many times, and if you look at the debt burden of Europe, the US, Japan and so on (not to mention the latest US budget deal) it's not hard to figure out the trajectory for the remaining government currencies. 
It's just a question of how fast they are dying - two or three percent a year, or much more rapidly in a hyperinflationary spiral?

A PoW change to avoid ASICs will be necessary at some point in the future. I came to that conclusion some time again, and all that has been happening since then is just confirming it (at least in my own opinion). 
ASIC development is costly so few firms will tend to do it. Some will be better than others, so there will be even less real competition, if any at all. The manufacturer will naturally be in a position to dominate and control mining itself. I don't see this changing. You can have a new player with deep pockets (such as the Japanese firms in 2018) come in and displace the leader, but that doesn't change the fact that it will remain centralized, just under a new leader. 
I don't have a warm fuzzy about GPU/CPU based mining. I just don't see it as an inherent disaster.

Who knows? I've $10,000 is a common estimate, but some say only $8000. Trace Mayer projected $27,000 by sometime in February. Nobody really knows. 
Bitcoin is being driven by adoption, which in turn is tempered by bad news and helped by technical advances and regulatory approvals. It's hard to predict much of that, especially the bad news like major hacks and legal shocks. Who guessed that China would finally shut down exchanges after years of fake "China bans bitcoins" rumors?
Clearly the trend is upwards. I was talking to my wife about it yesterday and gave the example of young millenials who put $20 into it a few years ago and asked her "Where do you think they are going to invest when they inherit $500,000?" Ironically you sound similar to this example. And my guess is there are a lot of people like you out there.

Not in comparison to other cryptos, no. Other cryptos have a variety of minor advantages (faster block times, lower fees, niche capabilities like smart contracts or prediction markets or messaging systems and so on), but nothing decisive or that outweighs the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.
To me the biggest ultimate risk is that of governance. I have yet to see what I think is a really solid and durable model for governance of a cryptocurrency, as regardings its technical features and any economic choices that might come up for a decision. Most altcoin governance is downright bad (developers having overwhelming influence or outright control), though some are trying to tackle this in some fashion with voting mechanisms. But all such efforts are in an early experimental stage.
Don't get me wrong, I think we can lurch along with the current "herd of cats" model and that may be good enough to be an improvement over central banks. Bitcoin's gone a long way in 8 years without this being a fatal flaw. So I wouldn't call this a "bright red" problem. But I'd code it "yellow" rather than green.

Best case it gets canceled and Bitcoin becomes unencumbered of a huge albatross that has been around its neck. But if the fork happens, how are people imagining that this will work to their advantage?
(And no, I don't agree that the BCH fork was "free money." Since BCH supporters are almost entirely former Bitcoiners (not new entrants to crypto), their peeling off did not create more value in the space. It's a safe bet Bitcoin would have just risen even more since August if BCH did not exist and they were still in the Bitcoin community.)

You can buy on Gemini now, but I would advise against leaving your coins on their exchange. Park them somewhere safe and don't make any transactions after the fork until it is resolved. 
Gemini has left itself waffle room (as have many exchanges). If the miners stay with the NYA Gemini has indicated they might take that as a signal to call B2X "Bitcoin." It would be better if they would clarify that it is market support, not miner support, that should define Bitcoin.

Still, I expect volatility as we get closer to the fork. It's not what we know that is the problem, it's what we don't know. What mechanizations may be in place, and what defenses may be prepared but not generally known, and how will bitcoin traders react in an actual battle for the fate of bitcoin?

Exchanges will allow trading pretty quickly, they just won't allow withdrawals (or process deposits) until one chain is dead or they've worked out the replay issues. So you will need your coins on an exchange if you want to sell them soon after the fork.

I'm not talking about the EDA. My point is that if the miners initially stick with the NYA for even a brief time, and bow to economic reality subsequently, this switching of which chain has the greatest proof of work will happen.
It's unlikely to happen more than twice (once if you don't count the fork itself), but if the miners make a final effort to put B2X into the spotlight by mining it we'll see this happen and Gemini will confuse a lot of people. Only if most miners concede before the fork will this be avoided. In which case, why bother proceeding with B2X at all? Keep in mind it has no replay protection.

1. There are many wallets out there, such as Core, Armory and Electrum, not to mention paper wallets and hardware wallets. Exchanges are just what you use to trade Bitcoin for something else, and you can do that without an exchange.
2. A bank account linked to an exchange is a convenient way to purchase bitcoin but there are many other ways. You can use Purse.io, or localbitcoins, or use Bitwage to be paid in bitcoin for example.
3. Depends on what you are trading Bitcoin for; Gemini, Kraken, HitBTC and so forth are exchanges for Bitcoin to Fiat. Or you can buy other cryptocurrencies on sites like Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex and Cryptopia. Or you can spend your Bitcoin at Purse.io or with vendors who accept Bitcoin directly.

Taxation for the just and right functions of government is fine. It becomes theft when it is taken for unjust purposes. In the case of the U.S. (and I imagine it's worse elsewhere) that would be about 90% of what government does. But there's a world of difference between a government shrunken to its proper role and no government at all.
If you really believe all taxation is theft then either you believe in a government that runs on pure charity or no government at all (anarchism).
The non-aggression principle is fine in theory. It breaks down in practice because people squabble endlessly like toddlers over who started any given fight. "You crossed the line first!" "Did not!" "Did too!" Suffice to say the non-aggression principle does not preclude good government, only bad government. 
Be sure to let all the crypto scammers out there know that they should not violate the non-aggression principle. That way we'll have no need of regulations and can all relax in our utopia...

For whatever reason alts seem to engage in more volatile swings when Bitcoin swings in the same direction. So if you think Bitcoin is going to pump, being in alts tends to work out even better.

I'm libertarian. But let's define libertarian. 
Folks in past times had two words, Liberty and License. Liberty referred to freedom to act within moral boundaries. License, by contrast referred to the freedom to act without moral boundaries. 
You can see this old distinction still in things like fishing licenses, drivers licenses, and so forth. Here you are being given a "license" to act without the state monitoring you every time you drive or catch a fish to see that you are only doing it for moral purposes. The phrase "James Bond, license to kill" is also a reflection of this idea - otherwise James Bond movies would mostly be about the grand juries and courtroom deliberations coming from each of his escapades - the idea being that he could do anything without legal repercussions.
By contrast a libertarian is not an anarchist. Your liberty can be taken by a mugger or kidnapper just as much as a repressive government. Because it is rather obvious that lots of people are scammers and crooks and will take advantage of people if given the chance, we do need good laws and good law enforcement to keep them in check and maximize our liberty. 
That's why "regulation" is not a dirty word. It depends on the specifics of each piece of regulation. Is it designed to maintain the power of central bankers and suppress cryptocurrency? Or is it designed to protect us from crypto scammers? Is it effective and not overbearing in doing so? Does it invite state surveillance of private transactions? Does it prohibit only wrong actions, or a whole class of actions most of which are not wrong in themselves?

Those Core developers were there as individuals. There are dozens in Core, so it's completely wrong (as a lot of FUDsters have been doing ever since) to claim that "Core" agreed to the HKA because of their presence.
One reason to delay a blocksize increase HF as long as practical is to package as many other changes requiring a HF in as can be safely arranged, to minimize the number of HFs in Bitcoin development. There is also the question of timing - the NYA was very unrealistic about the timeline for a safe HF, and we're seeing the reality of that played out now.

You need your coinbase account to transfer fiat in and then send it to GDAX. The two work together. At least, I've always assumed that was the case.
There is a significant counter-argument to using only GDAX, I've discovered: With bitcoin going up a significant amount on an average day, it can actually be cheaper to buy on Coinbase using a bank transfer. It takes a week for the funds to clear, but you get the current price plus ~1% fee. But if bitcoin goes up more than 1% in that week, you've come out ahead compared to waiting for the funds to clear and then buying at the later, higher price on GDAX.

I agree with you that to go mainstream Bitcoin needs to be _much_ safer and easier to use and resistant to accidental losses or hacking. When all is said and done I believe this will take the form of widespread (ie., universal for common purposes) escrow services that will work something like this:
1. You deposit your BTC with the escrow service in a multi-sig account.
2. You then spend with vendors like with a credit card. The escrow service gets a tiny cut (much less than credit cards) in return for the security they provide you and the vendor.
3. Chargebacks may be available, depending on the service and vendor policies.
4. Payments are time-locked so in the event of honest mistakes, fraud or hacking of your account the funds can be clawed back as per the escrow service policy.
So long as we are not forced into such arrangements, having the option to use such services does not bother me, and I suspect something like this will be necessary to get a handle on all the hacking and accidental losses suffered by crypto users to this point. It's the cost of mainstream adoption.

I think this just killed the B2X fork.
To explain, the terms state that B2X has to fork and has to survive for 100 blocks for the deal to go through. So this gives Roger an out - if we get to the point of the fork and things look bleak like they do today, or look bleak after 50 blocks and things are not going their way, all he has to do is call his mining buddies and everyone pulls the plug on mining B2X.
Alternatively, Garzik's code has (another) bug in it and their blockchain locks up before 100 blocks anyway. :-D

When I was a pre-teen and became aware of the diversity of religious faiths out there I asked myself that very question - "If there are 10,000 religions, what are the odds I was born into the best one?" That set off years (actually decades) of study. 
The people who rail against "religion" are being anti-intellectual and painfully stupid. It's like railing against "politics" or "economics" because every single person invariably takes a certain political or economic stance. And they have a religious position as well, one of the 10,000. It's just that they arrive at it by blind prejudice, the absence of critical thinking and, conveniently, it matches up with the dominant teaching of their schools/entertainment media/news media. Imagine that. 
And then they can't figure out why I collapse in gales of laughter when they start preaching about being an independent critical thinker and not blindly following some dumb superstition.

I don't know about an altcoin dump (they've been left behind for a while). But if there is no further loss of mining hashpower signalling NYA at some point that will create a lot of anxiety. So long as the B2X futures stay in the dumps at 15% of BTC I think it will be OK, but once general media articles start spelling out what no replay protection means I think the new money flowing in will dry up at least until things are resolved.

The 2X attack is being pushed by a narrow, self-interested faction that profits off the bitcoin community and has a vested interest in holding it hostage, and in preventing scaling methods that weaken their control over us.

If nothing else you can compare it to everyday goods like a loaf of bread.
If Bitcoin "wins," people will use IT as the frame of reference for the cost of everything else. You won't hear people talk about "what is a bitcoin worth" for the same reason you don't often hear people ask "what is a dollar worth?" The answer will be that a bitcoin is worth 1 bitcoin.

It's legit, but it is a good idea to read the T&amp;C carefully. I'm selling my BT2 and holding BT1 from the split (actually buying more with the proceeds from the BT1 sales), and this means my BT1/BTC is basically locked up with Bitfinex until they convert BT1 into BTC and release it. 
If the hardfork happens as planned that should happen shortly thereafter. But if the fork is canceled, ironically I think I might have to wait until the end of the year or something like that, because BF may not want to take the risk of releasing the tokens (and canceling all value of the BT2 tokens) only to have someone resurrect the NYA fork a few weeks later.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:14:19
It is already priced in. What would not be priced in are future changes/surprises related to the 2X fork, such as:
1. A sudden announcement they are abandoning the effort before the hard fork date.
2. Future changes in replay protection. This is a big  deal, and I have no clue what their next step will be related to replay protection since they scrapped their first, ill-conceived effort.
3. Whale manipulation on the Bitfinex futures market. All along I've seen a few large (200/500/1000 tokens) orders supporting the 2X effort, making me think even the current weak pricing for B2X is the result of whales propping it up. Those large orders shift around a bit, careful to always stay deep enough to not be easily hit. But they've been there every time I've looked for a week. So watch for more active manipulation and beware.

The standard advice is that the best time to buy was several years ago, and the next best time is now. 
No one knows what the price will do, but it's been moving up at a rate of 0.2-0.3% a day on average for a year or more now. So either buy in now, or set a timeline and use dollar-cost averaging to start buying in.
Best wishes and don't forget to Hodl!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:48:25
False. 
The fee is based on how large (in bytes) your transaction is. Actually, a larger transaction may tend to be more expensive because it is more likely to incorporate multiple inputs (assuming your accumulated bitcoin is the result of multiple incoming TX). 
Most of the time you won't see this, but if you try emptying your wallet and have a lot of dust (small inputs) in it, you can see the effect pretty dramatically.
EDIT: To clarify, like others say, the fee you pay declines as a _percentage_ the more you send (until you hit dust as I mentioned above). In most cases you'll find yourself paying "X" fee whether sending 0.1 or 1000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:03:57
How would it condition anyone to anything? I think that's a bit over the top. 
As for corrupting the pipeline, that's an interesting thought. Someone could design an ASIC, then try to plant an algorithm that is compatible with it. In response I'd say:
1. A new algorithm could be quickly introduced as soon as there was significant suspicion of ASIC use, bricking their investment.
2. The algorithm selection process could be arranged so that no one knows what the new algorithm would be until shortly before implementation. For example by having several algorithms from which one is randomly selected or by randomly altering secondary parameters late in the process. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:01:44
Possibly. Or possibly the NYA team will give up and announce the fork is off in 2 weeks and BTC soars on the elimination of uncertainty and an end to the scaling wars and ReformedUnicorn has to buy in much higher.

You can't just switch algorithms at some arbitrary point. Who'd be ready to jump in and mine with everything properly configured at any random instant? That would create bigger risks than it would solve. 
I favor a PoW change with a stated policy that changes will be pursued as needed to prevent specialized mining hardware (i.e., ASICS and FPGAs) from gaining an advantage. However the issue of botnets should be addressed if possible, and the change should take place far enough out to allow honest miners a chance to ROI before we pretty much brick their equipment. (Some can go mine BCH, but there's not enough profit in that to go around.)

It's always risky, but the timing is as good as any time and the upside is huge. 
If I'm reading the tea leaves correctly, the NYA folks are revisiting replay protection on their hardfork in a way that makes it more likely the B2X fork will either be abandoned or introduced as a non-destructive altcoin. In which case we will see clarification soon on Bitcoins path forward and a resulting surge in the market.

Edit: OK, sorry, so far as I know no one has indicated they will support BTG. But Bitfinex only handles about a dozen major alts, so I'd be very surprised if they announced support for it.
I think you are confusing Bitcoin Gold (BTG) with the NYA 2X effort. The latter is what Bitfinex announced they would support under the B2X ticker.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:35:00
They are related, and hashrate shifting around will directly impact greatest proof of work.
It's not hard to see how this could happen. If the 85% of miners signalling NYA did switch as planned at the hardfork Gemini would quickly be calling BTX "Bitcoin." But with all the other exchanges listing it as an alt and the futures markets transitioning to regular markets with B2X at 13-15% the value of bitcoin, the miners will only be earning 1/7 of the revenue they could with real Bitcoin.
So pretty quickly some will start peeling off and before long most hashpower will be back to mining real Bitcoin. At some point then the total proof of work on it exceeds the B2X fork. Then Gemini will switch gears again and change what fork they are calling "Bitcoin". 
Keeping in mind that most other exchanges won't be changing names, Gemini is going to be causing mass confusion as their customers look at other exchanges and compare it with theirs. Just as with BCH, we're bound to get a few knuckleheads showing up here screaming about how they just made a killing buying Bitcoin for a fraction of the price on Gemini.

What gives a cryptocurrency value? The fact that people want them and are willing to trade other items of value (such as dollars) for them. Why do they value them? There are a myriad of answers to that question, given the diversity of financial niches and projects being explored by cryptocurrencies. 
Don't get hung up on the lack of government sanction for crypto. It's absurd to think something only has value if government sanctions it. Does food only have value if a government says it does? Did gold only obtain value when some king said it did? The current reliance on government-issued fiat for money is a historical anomaly. Value is ultimately given by the wants and needs of humanity at large, not by edict from a centralized power.

BT1 converts to the current Bitcoin (SW1X) at the point of the November hardfork. If the hardfork is called off we'll have to read the fine print on when we'll get our BTC back, but the point is BT1 is Bitcoin as it exists today. (A fellow redditor pointed out that if the hardfork collapses you'll likely be able to buy BT2 back for almost nothing, at which point you can recombine tokens and get your bitcoin back immediately.)

Which is  why Coinmarketcap uses some judgement in how it calculates market cap - right now it lists Veritaseum at $132M, not $6B. 
I agree that market cap can be gamed, but it's a helpful way of comparing coins. Paying attention to only the cost of a coin without considering the # in circulation is obviously no improvement. Just do enough research before investing in a given coin to understand how the coin supply is calculated and the future emissions rate.

So long as anyone is mining it enough to generate a block and people are paying attention, the system is working. 
The 10 minute block time is only an average. It's downright common for there to be a 60 minute or even 90 minute block just from statistical variance. 
Moreover, since BCH launched with their EDA periodically sucking up to half of miners off Bitcoin to mine it we've seen the block time of bitcoin skyrocket regularly. It's a bit of a hassle and can cause the mempool to start backing up and fees to spike, but it's been an annoyance more than a serious issue.

1. Congratulations.
2. First order of business is to take steps to safeguard the wallets/passwords. Get copies of everything onto a USB flash drive and get a safe deposit box. Or two. It's a small price to pay at this point. Guard what you have with you are best as you can. (EDIT: Like someone else said - be EXTREMELY careful to not do anything with your computer that could introduce bitcoin malware at this point - use another computer even just to research step 3.)
3. From the comments you've made here you don't know much (or have forgotten much, and at any rate a lot has changed). Take the time to do a LOT of research to catch yourself up. Once you've done step 2, it's more important to figure out what to do and how to do it right than rush anything and screw it up.
4. Don't trust anyone - you are going to be targeted by phishing, by anyone offering help here, etc. (I don't mean to offend/insult/accuse anyone here who has offered help, but he can't afford to be making new friends at this point if you know what I mean. It's nothing personal.) If you take the time to do your research in step 3, you really shouldn't _need_ help. If you do, find help from someone who doesn't know your story and what you have.
5. Consider starting new social media accounts to cover your tracks as you pursue step 3. Consider this one tainted. Same goes for email addresses and so forth. You've just taken on a huge risk and made yourself a big target (sorry). 
6. Remember money doesn't buy happiness (though it does eliminate some worries). Don't let it become a burden. You can always put it out of your mind for a while once step 2 is complete if it is weighing too heavily on you.
My sincere best wishes to you, and may this be a blessing for you and not a curse.

Localbitcoins or homegrown variants will proliferate.

My wife (who's going down twice this year on mission trips) would like to start a school and/or orphanage down there... it would be nice if I could ultimately fund it.

There has not been any hardfork. The Segwit activation was via softfork. It is gradually being adopted and that is helping, but during busy periods (like right now before the BTG fork) you can expect to see spikes. 
One problem with the fee estimation tools is that they don't anticipate, they are only looking at historical fees and the existing mempool. So if you know you are about to hit a busy time (like right now) you may want to manually go high with the fee. 
Conversely, if you can wait for the weekend you can set a lower fee since TX activity pretty consistently drops over the weekend.

That's a sadly incoherent emotion. If there is no God then there is no such thing as "doing something useful." It's all futile, just atoms bouncing off atoms with no meaning to it all. I could feed a child or I could beat a child and there's nothing in atheism to say one is better than the other. (Since caring for orphans is something you sneer at as "pollution" what do you consider useful? The opposite?)
But you are right at the deeper level, there are useful things to be done because there is meaning to the universe because there is a Will superintending it. I cannot justify myself before God, but I can reflect His love because He first loved me.

Wait a year for when it crashes to $1200. Except, it doesn't really work that way does it? It might go to $30,000 instead. 
And the reality is, if you watched Bitcoin tank from $6000 to $1200 you'd probably get sick to your stomach just thinking about investing in it. Only those who have strong faith in Bitcoin would be buying in at that point. And those are precisely the people who have already invested and are not standing on the sidelines asking if they should buy in.
I know because I was one of those people. Started in January 2014 just after the first peak over $1000. Watched it slide to a flash crash low of $178 a year later. Doubled down and invested more in the low 200's. That took a strong act of faith and will. I just kept reasoning it out and the answer was that Bitcoin was still an awesome opportunity. Nothing was fundamentally broken. 
So don't sit around dithering. Don't rush and make a mistake. Do your homework on how to safely store your coins, but dollar-cost average or make your first buys as you wish and then just hodl and don't worry about the gyrations. Over the long run they don't matter.

They both have the same segwit. Only difference is that the NYA folks wanted to double the block size.
Virtually the entire Dev community backs core ( as do users, exchanges, etc. All the NYA faction has are a majority of miners and a few large businesses, with daily defections now and no one joining.
That's why the futures market for the NYA coin has collapsed to just over .1 BTC per their token. 
The hired guns doing the coding for the NYA effort have proven entirely unable to even manage the "simple" changes required for the hardfork, such as managing decent replay protection (

They chose to invest their capital in a risky venture. That doesn't change anything or mean they should control the rest of us. By this logic we should just go back to central banks and letting them run things unilaterally because they are the ones providing capital. 
Miners should have a voice based on their holdings of BTC, same as the rest of us. But no more than that. Bitcoin became broken the day a miner realized he could hold the system hostage by blocking upgrades until his pet demands were met.

Futures markets.  Not to mention the various bitcoin groups that have been publishing statements against B2X and the lack of support noted at Bitcoin conferences and online surveys. I'm being conservative with the 80% figure as it seems the support comes predominantly from powerful mining pool operators and businesses with overweight influence in the futures markets. My guess is it's really closer to 5-10%. Knock out the newbies who support it out of simple naivety (2 must be better than 1?) and my guess is we're talking like 1%.

There has been a noticeable absence of major hacks in the past year - I think the surviving exchanges are finally getting their act together. I doubt we've read of the last one, but it's far different from when I started in crypto almost 4 years ago.
Of course that still leaves a bunch of other risks - it's still volatile, repressive governments still make threats at it, and there is the greatest issue, that of corruption from within as exemplified by the B2X hardfork. 
Bitcoin will never be risk-free. But it's riskier to avoid it and stay 100% vulnerable to a fiat collapse than to start investing in it, IMO.

If there is a split there will be two blockchain ledgers. Anyone who owned bitcoin before the split will own the same number of coins on each of the ledgers after the split. 
This can be a financial bonus, but it also creates risks. The NYA group is refusing to implement replay protection (and even working to subvert efforts to protect the Core chain), which means you may very well spend coins on both chains after the split when you only intended to spend one set of coins. If both forks have some value such events will be extremely upsetting to users, and they are making it very hard to prevent it from happening on a large scale.

It's not a terrible article (especially coming from a non-bitcoiner), but it does have a few flaws. I do agree with his basic thesis that if neither side backs down things will likely get ugly in November. I'd offer the following points.
1. The NYA dates back to May, not August, and triggered Segwit in late July (such that it activated in August). 
2. He doesn't mention checkpoints, which I presume could be used to define the preferred chain for the minority-hashrate chain and preserve it if needed. I haven't seen any mention of this from Core but presume it will be employed if things start to look dicey.
3. As I mention above, his implied argument that the scarcity of Bitcoin can be changed as easily as the block size does not acknowledge the lack of incentive to do so. Only non-bitcoiners would have an incentive to attack bitcoin in this manner, and it's hard to see how they could mount a credible attack without multi-billion dollar investment into the very thing they are trying to subvert.
4. He doesn't really get into it, but if he wanted to extend his discussion into currency vs. commodity (which I thought was pretty good) he'd do well to investigate the Lightning Network and similar work going on in Bitcoin. (For the record I believe a successful coin must be optimized for a single role, and this issue of currency or store of value will be the single greatest and most significant debate that Bitcoin has yet to really face. My preferred solution is for Bitcoin to remain the premier store of value, and Litecoin or other options to serve as digital cash.)

What percentage of the population has adopted cryptocurrency? How thoroughly have they transitioned to it and out of old fiat? These are still the early days of adoption.

They promptly replied within 3 hours to the second ticket with instructions on how to upgrade to an Institutional account.

Given how messed up their replay protection efforts (or lack thereof) are, it would be better if the fork was called off. Otherwise I'm afraid there will be a lot of confusion and some cases of lost bitcoins that will lead to a wave of negative news stories.
The flow of news continues to hammer the NYA effort though. For example, this morning we have:
1. Coindesk article explaining that Core is plowing forward with future scaling enhancements (MAST and Schnorr signatures), giving the lie to anti-bitcoin FUD about Core not working on scaling.
2. F2Pool ending signaling for B2X.
3. The buy wall at 0.2 on the Bitfinex futures market for BT2 (B2X token) is now being eaten into and is mostly gone, after the retreat from the 0.25 baseline of the first week of trading. (I've also noticed the whale orders below 0.2 are being adjusted down.)

I've noticed (who is still quite active here) features pretty highly in the link you gave, so you might get his 2 satoshis on the subject.
For me Proverbs 18:17 applies - this link gives one side, without providing for cross-examination. For example, the link gives a litany of examples of users being banned or censored after making seemingly trivial or mundane posts cited by the author. I smell a rat. I suspect that on further investigation we'd find in many cases that the examples cited by the author were not the reason for the ban, but something else much more egregious.
Of course it's also possible that the mods have made some bad calls. They've clearly had a busy time of it. And it might be hard to be perfectly consistent in detecting when someone is broaching a subject honestly vs. malicious trolling. (~20 years ago I was a moderator on a message board devoted to a minority viewpoint on a controversial subject, and I'm thankful I didn't have to deal with 90% of the issues mods today deal with.)

It could be managed more adroitly than that (and I'm guessing Satoshi, as intelligent as he is, would manage it that way).
For example, he could publish a signature proof that he's out there, along with a statement that he will not be dumping but is planning an auction of X amount of his holdings not before Y date.
By doing it as an off-exchange trade he avoids dumping into the order book of an exchange. 
So wouldn't he still get a lower price because of the large magnitude (presumably) of his sale? Not at all, because this would also be an opportunity for whales out there to buy up large amounts of BTC without massive slippage themselves. We saw this with the Silk Road auction and there's no reason to think it would be different this time around.

It's predictable - as BTC balloons traders start looking to rebalance their gains and reduce their exposure to BTC at the new highs. But they don't want to be out of a market like this (to fiat), so they start flowing into the higher quality alts. 
If the boom continues, with fiat flowing into BTC, traders will keep pumping, working down the scale until they are massively pumping the sketchy stuff. This is how things went back in March after BTC had broken through to new ATH; the overall alt market cap exploded in April/May.

The hardfork will not happen until mid-November. The only way to sell your B2X right now is to sent your BTC to Bitfinex, split it using their token split tool, and then sell the BT2 futures tokens, which convert to B2X if the fork does happen.

Don't bother with the mining (most are scams or at least an inefficient way to get bitcoin), just buy bitcoins directly from an exchange like Gemini, Kraken or Coinbase.

BTG forks on Oct. 25 according to their timeline. B2X splits around Nov. 17-18 if they follow through. You don't need to do anything beforehand for the latter if you have a HW wallet. Afterwards you'll need to learn how to safely split your coins. Since the NYA team is back at square 1 on the subject of replay protection I have no clue what that is going to entail.
With BTG I also have no idea, because it's not clear if they are forking properly or doing some premine scam and allocation of BTG coins based on a past fork date. Their promotion and response/handling of questions/allegations has been incredibly inept so I've written off taking them seriously.

Bitcoin can be divided into additional decimal places beyond 1 satoshi (and already is in some exchanges and the Lightning Network). 
As far as adjusting for inflation - what do you mean? Inflation with dollars, yen, etc. is caused by central banks printing money excessively to dilute the value of existing money (hurting savers and helping debtors, of which the governments are the biggest). That form of corruption doesn't apply to bitcoin with its fixed supply and schedule of mining.

When they set the Block # at which it would occur they probably forgot to account for the fact that continuous growth in mining hashpower means we are typically finding blocks faster than 1/10 minutes. It's enough of a difference to chop a day or two off, which is what happened.
So everyone got "October 25" in their head, and we got caught off guard when the fork happened last night. (I missed out on a fair amount due to having BTC on loan until today - a lesson learned for future forks.)

The fork won't happen that quickly unless there is a massive leap in hashrate right away. Bashco's clock got set back by the latest BCH EDA but I'm sticking with my estimate of November 13. His clock should converge towards the true date the closer we get.

Bitcoin critics keep claiming it costs some astronomical amount of money to process a bitcoin transaction. This is false/misleading, because it ignores that role of the block reward in mining. 
Once block rewards become negligible we will see the actual relationship between transactions and mining electricity use emerge. Assuming volatility goes down and mining remains decentralized and competitive the formula will look like this:
Average Electricity Cost/TX = (Average Bitcoin TX fee - (Mining Hardware Purchase Costs/TX) - (Rent, Operations and Other Mining Expenses/TX) - (Miners profit/TX))
In other words if the average bitcoin fee is $1, and miners spend half their expenses on electricity and half on everything else, then the electricity cost/TX will be 50 cents. 
Keep in mind that with LN and other off-chain solutions we should eventually reach a point where only major bitcoin transactions (such as intra-bank transfers, corporate purchases and the wealthiest investors moving their assets around) are posted on the blockchain. The rest of us will be dealing off-chain with very low TX fees.

I mean that you can multiply your BTC by splitting them for BT1 and BT2 tokens, and sell the BT2 to the whale(s) propping up the BT2 price. With the current .25/.75 split you can get ~1.333 BT1 for every BTC split.
Of course this carries the risk of BTC somehow being driven below the B2X price and no miners supporting it such that it dies, but the flow of news I'm seeing points entirely in the opposite direction. So only invest what you can afford to lose and all that.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:59:18
In fairness, it's not the banks' fault.
If you try to run, expect that this will catch up with you in one form or another. There's a reason systems like credit reporting exist, and you can assume that any new banks will sooner or later, probably sooner, find out.
I suggest a better solution: Present your side of things to the bank to appeal in case there are any judgment calls they have to make about the funds. (Or be ready to, at any rate.) Accept the loss if it turns out the bitcoin buyer was using stolen funds. And improve your own procedures to vet customers so this doesn't happen again.

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:55:30
If you look at the price of the BT1 and BT2 tokens together they add up together to the price of Bitcoin itself. (Or would if the market would slow down). 
So insofar as the B2X fork has any support, the market discounts that from the BTC futures token. The lower price is based on the risk of B2X winning and eliminating the BTC fork. I don't see a realistic chance of that happening now.

A few years ago there were ~700 functional cryptos. Today that's gradually expanded to ~850. Expect there to be over 1,000 in ten years (but not wildly more).

For all our disagreements I think one of the bedrock beliefs all factions in cryptocurrency agree on is that central bank currencies are bad/corrupt because they dilute the value of money held by people by issuing more of that same currency. For a cryptocurrency team to monkey expand the coin supply would thus be extraordinarily hypocritical.
Moreover, it would be against the best interests of literally the entire userbase of that coin. So it is difficult to come up with a scenario where such an idea could even get traction - and not surprisingly I've never seen such a proposal acted upon amongst any mined (PoW) cryptocurrency. The nearest I can think of was dogecoin adopting a PoS interest rate, but I'm vague on the background/details of that.
(I have seen a few minor alts jack with the coin supply in the opposite direction - reducing future mining rewards to increase the value of existing coins.)
I think such a proposal to increase the coin supply would be dismissed outright as a joke by bitcoiners. If it were pushed by a powerful outside source I believe it would make all our scaling debates to date look like a tea party, so ferocious would the response be. I don't want anyone diluting my bitcoins.

If you used faucets and got a lot of dust (very small payments), then you have a challenge. I had this and was able to address it right at the BCH fork when transaction activity plummeted. You might be able to do the same thing on the eve of the B2X hardfork ~Nov. 13. 
Otherwise, you can manually set a low fee (hopefully, I am not familiar with Copay) and see if it goes through on the weekend when activity is lower. Or just be patient and wait for segwit adoption to increase and try to catch a quiet period (maybe over Christmas?)

Some whale decided to pump the price until shorts started getting liquidated, forcing them to buy BTC to cover their short position. Which forces the price higher (since this is all happening in milliseconds on computers), which liquidates more short positions, which causes the cycle to keep going. It can cause a massive price spike very quickly, and ruin the day for a lot of margin traders who were betting on BTC price going down. The whale sells at the top and makes a fortune.

@_date: 2018-04-07 20:41:25
No, everyone thinks that but it is only vaguely close to accurate. Due to the fact that difficulty adjustments only happen every 2016 blocks and the constant and fairly steep growth in mining hashpower, blocks tend to average a good deal less - maybe 9 or 9 1/2 minutes average over the long run. So the actual halvening is going to happen significantly faster (by a factor of a couple weeks or months) than a simple projection would give.
It also means that if this kept up long term we'd see the last satoshi mined years earlier than 2140.
EDIT 2 (corrected, I had the wrong start date by a year): At the block height reported above it would take 3591 days to reach 517087 blocks at 144 blocks/day. Instead it has taken 3375 days (counting from the day of the 2nd block, as Satoshi was slow in producing it nearly a week after the genesis block). That shows how increasing hashrate has accelerated the mining schedule by over 215 days (~7 months) so far.
EDIT: Per   the first halvening was 11/28/12 and the second was 7/9/16, a pull-in of over 4 months from the typically-quoted figure of 4 years (as cited in that link).  projects the next halvening is 5/30/20, a more modest pull-in. But since the latter link doesn't seem to be adjusting for future increases I bet it is also late by a month or more at this point in its estimation.

I mistakenly used 2008 rather than 2009 for the start date at first. Other than that I don't understand why others are being so boneheaded about this. Maybe vague statements about 10 minute blocks are OK for them, but that's wildly inaccurate when it comes down to specifics. 
Personally I find it noteworthy that estimates of the halvening date are weeks or months off in virtually all articles, and years off for the likely date of the last satoshi mined. I guess maybe I'm the only one.

Your statement is incoherent. A (real) libertarian, by definition, believes in voluntary transactions freed of coercion. Whereas you speak of someone "tak[ing] your money" as if implying they are manipulating or coercing you short of violence. If they are then they aren't being libertarians, pure and simple. And if you are engaging in a voluntary transaction then what cause have you to complain?
The only alternative to a free market is an unfree market, where one side is coerced into making transactions they would otherwise not make. I find it ironic and troubling that so many people speak against "free markets" by giving examples that are precisely _not_ free markets, and their solution is the very thing they are decrying - the implementation of coercive forces via government or other entities to force their own personal idea of "fairness" on other people.

With fees as low as they are now Bitcoin is certainly better for merchants than credit cards. Credit cards run around ~3% fees for the merchant (or so I'm told), and they have to deal with the hassles of chargebacks. 
With cash there is the cost of counting, processing and getting it to the bank safely, as well as the issue of counterfeiting. Again for merchants it's a win from that standpoint. With the LN the time to confirm a TX will be shorter than a credit card TX, so that's the point at which it becomes a viable alternative for real-life TX. But even now it's quite viable for most online purchases.
The real competition for Bitcoin isn't from the 20th-century dinosaurs like credit cards, but from the 2nd and 3rd generation cryptocurrencies like Nano. Personally I'd like to see Bitcoin focus on being a store of value, with only secondary use as an actual currency, but I'm sure I'm in the minority around here.

I realize you are just representing the "mainstream" viewpoint, but notice you do so by imputing "horrifying boogeyman" interpretations on anyone who dissents. But one need not be an extremist to dispute a position that, while widespread in the halls of power, is nonetheless extremist itself in its record of spectacular failures in the end of each fiat currency.
People only partially account for inflation in their mental estimation of the value of things. Insofar as it is not always kept in mind, and insofar as it is variable, it creates losses and risks that are undesirable. In any event, the toleration of "some" inflation is always risky because it puts governments on a slippery slope - when there is a crisis or irresponsible spending, the temptation is always there to just let inflation kick in a little higher to make tax the savers and relieve the debt load on government. And things ratchet another notch, and then another, until it begins to spiral, and you know the drill from there.
I would prefer a currency that is not "managed" for the "benefit", supposedly, of me or anyone else. It encourages dependency on the government, and an irresponsible attitude towards life with a lack of preparation to deal with issues as they arise. Viewed over the long term this has been disastrous on the character of nations thus controlled.

Since governments are the biggest debtors and just happen to also control (indirectly or not) the currency, this is a fox-guarding-the-henhouse situation. This is why trusting government currency is a foolish thing to do, and why decentralized currencies like Bitcoin will become preferred as a more trustworthy alternative.

"doesn't mean a free market can't be coercive as well
I admit, I'm utterly lost on what the younger generation means, or thinks it means, when it uses lines like this one. If there is coercion involved then it ceases to be a free market, doesn't it? If you mean that private parties can corrupt free markets into unfree markets then of course I agree with you, but the problem there is with the loss of a free market, not the free market itself.

I have one foot plant pretty equally between social conservatism and a libertarian ideology. Anarchists are as far removed from real libertarianism as the latter is from statists, as liberty can only be maintained in a fallen world through a government that has the necessary powers to safeguard our rights. But not one iota more power than that. (Many today who call themselves "libertarians" are just licensarians, such as the anarchists you declaim.)
But, you come from a statist worldview that is just as extreme as that of the ancaps. Both have a track record of creating hells on earth, because both too much government and too little lead to unchecked abuses by ambitious men, either outside the government or within it. 
You may be happy with your society, but as a dissident I resent my status as a slave, in which virtually the totality of government activities are oriented not towards preserving my rights, but trampling them to spend the money taxed from me on all manner of personal agendas contrary to my own designs and searing my conscience. If that is extreme, so be it.

The ASICBoost scandal involves these elements:
1. Patent infringement.
2. Incompatible with Segwit, which strongly incentivizes those using it to block an excellent technical advance for Bitcoin.
3. It was implemented secretly. Not that this is illegal, but it hurts the Bitcoin mining ecosystem when participants cannot plan effectively. KNCMiner (a competitor) went bankrupt a while back and publicly stated that they couldn't figure out how the Chinese were outcompeting them without some secret advantage. ASICBoost would explain that. Also note that Bitmain is potentially using ASICBoost in their own mining facilities while denying it to their customers, which is a rotten way to treat your customers.
4. Tied to  is the issue of centralization. It's not healthy for Bitcoin to be dependent on just one ASIC manufacturer or a small mining cartel - in fact it could be fatal to Bitcoin. On this point look up the Antbleed scandal that Bitmain was also embroiled in. Again, this is not a matter of breaking the law, but it is really, really bad for Bitcoin to have mining centralization, even if it was done through entirely legal and honest means.

Long term, centralized currencies cannot compete with decentralized currencies because of the trust issue and historical experience. Governments and central banks have a long history of either financial mismanagement or printing money as a solution to their overspending. So when you talk about a lot of people getting hurt, that's what I picture - all the people complacently sitting in their fiat (and telling me "it can never happen to my currency" when I point out the risk of what they are doing.)
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:07:54
If this is accurate it sets up Bitmain for a fall. Dedicated ASICS will invariably be more efficient than a jack-of-all-trades device like this may be. So if a coin's community is OK with ASICs or just wants to kick Bitmain in the face it just allows ASICs and these devices are inefficient and unprofitable.
On the flip side I doubt these devices will be perfectly adaptable, which means anyone inclined against them should be able to develop algorithms or mining protocols that are incompatable with these devices. Again, Bitcoin and any customers for this lose out.
What Bitmain must really be terrified about is Nano. It's a direct competitor to bcash as a cash replacement coin, but gets rid of miners entirely. Not to mention beating bcash in every key category (free, more scalable, no environmental issues, faster, not controlled by mining cartels) (I consider bitcoin a store of value (digital gold) and thus not a direct competitor IMHO).

It's the dumbest pump and dump ever. A rise for an increase to 32 MB blocks on a chain that doesn't need 100 kb. blocks. So that's just an open invitation to a spam attack. That and an embarassingly stunted form of smart contracts that pales in comparison to what a plethora of other cryptos already have. 
If they actually had some innovation going on we could say the rise was based on that. But there's nothing there (or worse than nothing so far as the spam attack vector goes), so it's just a run-of-the-mill crypto scammer pump-and-dump going on.

Liberty = freedom to act within moral bounds. 
License = freedom  to act without moral bounds.
This is forgotten today, but can still be seen in phrases like "James Bond, license to kill." We all have liberty to kill (i.e., in self-defence under appropriate circumstances). 
One never has liberty to do evil. 
There's no issue with forking off to create your own coin. But relying on a perpetual campaign of deceit and identity theft to market it, they need to face the consequences. "Libertarian" Ver makes a mockery of his claim to that title with his blatant rejection of Bitcoin's consensus mechanism in marketing his altcoin as something it is not. If he respected consensus he would not be lying and carrying on like this.

First, consider what your goals are for your money. What short and mid-term needs will you have, apart from a long term retirement goal? A new car in a couple years? A house someday? A family? (That last one is expensive ;-)
Now, also consider emergency needs - if you have a car and it died today, how would you manage? Bad stuff does happen over the course of a lifetime, so have a very safe/conservative fund for "rainy days." That's your foundation.
Above the foundation make sure you have your short-term goals funded conservatively as well. If you are planning a new car in 3 years and need to save up for it, don't have it invested in bitcoin or other risky option.
If saving something for a down payment on a house in 10 years, you can take somewhat more risk but still want to be fairly sane about it. Something like a mutual fund for example.
At your age, if you really don't need the money for anything else, an investment in bitcoin for long-term holding does make sense if you can handle the risk mentally. Personally I'd suggest buying into a couple other cryptocurrencies as well so you are not totally tied to just one. (See Coinmarketcap.com for leading options, for starters). Take the time to think through how you will hold any cryptocurrency safely and securely. You want to be safe both from hackers and from risks like a computer crash or flood/fire/tornado for example.
Best wishes and hope this helps...

"At some point, you're going to want to get your money from btc right?"
Let me put it this way: If Bitcoin goes to a million dollars a coin, it won't just be because Bitcoin is a success. It will be because Fiat currencies are dying.

Anything ASIC resistant - more to the point, with a policy that the algorithm will be changed as often as necessary to prevent specialized mining hardware from being developed to centralize mining. 
I'm not naïve. Even with CPU/GPU mining there is significant potential for economies of scale with mining farms using cheap electricity. But at least it gives a PoW coin like Bitcoin a fighting chance. With things like ASICBoost and Antbleed already coming up I don't believe the mining status quo is something Bitcoin can live with very long.

Bitcoin is defined by consensus. The consensus chose Segwit/LN (and was actually held up for a long time by Ver and company's shenanigans). They have chosen to blatantly disregard the consensus rule for defining Bitcoin and are pushing their own private personal altcoin in a case of identity theft. 
Quite apart from the legal fraud issues, Ver's actions show a contempt for the wishes of the Bitcoin community and the consensus mechanism that governs it. It makes a mockery of his claim to be libertarian. He's an autocratic scammer, pure and simple.

Seems like Paypal should be able to come up with a simple procedure for everyone to follow to eliminate these scams. For example, the buyer of the bitcoins has to post and sign a message proving ownership of the address they will take receipt of the BTC in. 
That way when they claim they didn't receive their coins it would be a trivial matter for the BTC seller and Paypal itself to check the blockchain and see that it did indeed receive the BTC. (Augmented by the BTC seller signing a message proving they control the sending address, if Paypal wanted to take it that far.)

Once in a while some random altcoin will surge like 10,000% because someone spends a few hundred dollars pumping it on a thinly traded market.

This debate has been dragging on for years before it came to a head this year as network capacity was reached and the fees started spiking way up. August 1 allowed enough time for people to get ready (one hopes), while not kicking the can down the road in perpetuity. 
The miners are not monolithic but mostly oppose segwit. Pretty much everyone else wants it. You can see the evidence for both these statements at:

That's not libertarianism. That's anarchism. The two are as different as statism is from libertarianism. The latter is simply the middle road between the extremes of no government and totalitarian government. It sounds like you are a libertarian yourself (more or less), but have become prejudiced against it by licensarians who don't understand what liberty is. Real liberty is the freedom to act within moral bounds (whereas license is the freedom to act immorally as well as morally). So when I speak of liberty (with this definition in mind) it automatically precludes the sorts free market distortions you speak of. But few who call themselves libertarians today appreciate this distinction grounded in the biblical worldview.
I'm sorry I sound like a jerk. I'll admit to being fierce in defense of what I see as right, because it seems like the western world has turned to autocracy and statism and that horrifies me. If anarchists had the upper hand they'd be calling me a jerk and I'd be focusing on them, no doubt.

It would be trivial to make PoW changes with variables that cannot be predicted, so that's not a concern. ASIC design, testing and production takes a good while, and ASIC-resistant PoW algorithms are already widely discussed.
More important is treating the mining community fairly. I criticize miners as a group a lot for how I perceive they are treating bitcoin users, but I think they should be treated fairly in any PoW change. 
In particular I would advocate making the change away from the current PoW at least a year out, on a fixed date. That would provide an opportunity to ROI with existing hardware (and hardware in the pipeline already), while enabling them to plan the transition in an orderly manner.

About 1/3 of that investment was in a mining rig in early 2014, the earnings of which roughly matched what I spent on the rig by the end of the year (when I stopped mining). Another third (roughly) when I doubled down and bought bitcoin directly while it was in the 200's in 2015, and the last third on more BTC since then. 
But that won't get you to 1000%. The biggest factor was realizing early this year that the scaling debate would not be resolved any time soon, but that there was pent up demand for crypto. Therefore, it would flow into the altcoin markets. I wish I had moved more aggressively, but even so I did it early enough to reap the benefit of the soaring alt markets.

I'm not sure I get your point. Tomorrow (etc) there will be a backlog again, so what has been gained? More to the point why would miners engage in such charity? Not just forgoing the reward, but by trying to clear the backlog they'd temporarily reduce profits from fees for all other miners on following blocks.

Empty blocks may be unrelated to ASICBoost, if for example someone mines a block seconds after the prior block was mined. But empty blocks are also an indicator of ASICBoost at work:
"the technique is easier to pull off when empty or nearly empty blocks are mined."

If you read Crypto news sites over the past months, relatively little is said about Bitcoin. It's mostly news of innovations, partnerships and new tech in a plethora of other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is now merely the flagship of a growing fleet, not a lone ship surrounded by rowboats.
That's why the alt markets have been soaring so much faster than bitcoin. There's been a lot of pent up demand for crypto, and the frustrations of the scaling debate plus the promise of all the new tech is sucking people in.

I like Electrum. I also have used MultiBit, but prefer Electrum. For ETH I just use Jaxx, but don't know how it compares. No complaints though.
I would NOT use a USB stick for long term storage. I've noticed they tend to become corrupted/unreadable after lying around a year or two without being plugged in. (So it is a good practice to plug them in every few months IMO. But I wouldn't trust them for long-term storage.) I'd suggest CD/DVD's kept in decent (climate-controlled) conditions - like in your house as opposed to the garage or attic, or else a hard drive.
Paper is good and a lot of people will advise it. My thought is that paper wallets are vulnerable to physical theft just as online ones can be hacked, and paper wallets can be destroyed (fire, flood, spilled coffee) just as computers can crash and lose online wallets. So it's more a personal preference than an absolute advantage one way or another.

@_date: 2017-05-08 04:10:49
Good question. I don't, and let me think about what would be different between these two cases....
In the case of bitcoin, because I habitually am thinking about bitcoin in BTC, the occasional time I run across mBTC forces me to do a mental conversion to relate it back to what I'm doing with everything else bitcoin-related. So every time I see mBTC, it leads me to doing mental operations, cross-checking myself, just so I can analyze the numbers that they could have just reported in BTC in the first place.
Whereas with mm. and meters... I use one set for some things, and another set for others things (and km. for a 3rd set of things). I don't convert between the scales (except in rare circumstances). If I'm looking at a blueprint at work it has everything in mm., and I'm comparing it to parts and other prints also using mm. If I'm measuring things around my property I would use meters, and be comparing my results with other things in meters. I really don't care how the distance between my house and barn relates to the dimensions of an airbag control module at work. So I don't struggle with a need to convert mm. to meters in these cases.
Hope this helps and gives some insight into the issue....

I think given his position/role in BTC, he understands it would be impolitic of him to do otherwise. The UASF truly needs to be a grassroots effort, or as near to that as possible - not a tool wielded by (perceived) overlords against a competitor. I say this because it runs roughshod over any hardcore anti-SW holdouts, without meeting the 95% consensus threshold. Having said that, I strongly favor the UASF and hope the bitcoin economy can hold together until August. It's going to be a tough couple of months.

It's just bad _in principle_ to be leaving your bitcoin in someone else's care and control. That's why we as a community never advise you to use something like Blockchain. Well, that and some nasty bugs that they've had the past few years. But most people were not affected by them.

That has nothing to do with the value of each dollar. If you sat on a stash of dollars from a hundred years ago until now their purchasing power would have dropped, what, 98%? In effect a near total loss. The best you could hope for is that they'd have some numismatic value.
That's why anyone sensible invests in assets that have a chance to appreciate in value. Holding government currency is pretty much guaranteed to be the worst investment you can make over time.

This is true. No way am I going to be able to stay with an exchange that refuses to accommodate the activation of BIP148. They are doing a disservice to their customers regardless how things turn out.
@_date: 2017-05-19 04:15:08
Why do you say it has a low probability? It sounds like BIP148 is structured to place miners in a difficult position: They lose nothing by mining the SW-fork if it activates, but if they mine the non-SW chain and the SW version EVER gets longer, their work is wasted (barring some other mechanizations, assuming there was time to deploy them). 
Moreover, if people simply support the SW version, as bitcoin users are strongly doing in poll after poll, the non-SW chain's value will tank, which will force the miners to mine on the profitable chain. So it looks to me like BIP148 is actually very powerful, if people simple follow through and favor it economically.

Without a widespread Lightning Network infrastructure (or similar offchain TX systems) Bitcoin would be hopelessly overwhelmed 5 minutes into a serious financial crisis.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:51:47
That's why there are fees for transactions. Fees were meant to supplement and ultimately replace the block rewards from mining.
The fees don't "have" to increase - they just need to be enough to pay for enough hashpower in a decentralized environment to secure the network. The fees we have today are plenty high for that, if mining decentralization could be maintained. That's the real issue.

Best wishes with it. As the standard rule goes, this being high risk you should only do so if your other savings are sufficient for your short and long term needs. (You can find various formula for checking this based on your age and anticipated income goals in many places online). 
Be sure to diversify within crypto, keeping the large majority in "large cap" crypto. Avoid FOMO. Don't trade often, and only with clear intent. (I have a rule that I have to be able to write a statement explaining why I take each position I do.) Have an exit strategy for investments that don't perform well. Make sure you know how to secure all your coins against both theft and loss (such as from house fires, floods, tornado, etc.). Pay attention to the news, but don't obsess over it.

It's apples and oranges. Ethereum is more centralized in governance, has an open-ended coin supply and a willingness to do bailouts as needed. (Granted, ETC fixes all these flaws.) Ethereum is designed around smart contracts, bitcoin is for now a store of value. While each may see some cross-over in usage, I expect the general trend to be the opposite: Coins will be optimized to specialize in certain niches rather than be a jack-of-all-trades-and-master-of-none.

Most people can easily earn more than 3.75% even without being in crypto. My utility company stock pays more than that in dividends for example, not even counting the steady appreciation in the price of the utility stock.

TX = transaction
Fee refers to the fee paid to the miners to process your bitcoin transaction, adding it to the blockchain. Used to be you could get away with doing TX without fees if you were patient, but now the opposite is true: TX fees are spiking up badly due to the congestion and lack of transaction capacity. We really need the UASF immediately, not months from now.

Anyway... point being, I celebrated being up 10X over my fiat investment last Friday, and I'm up another 20% since then. Granted a lot of this was from fiat purchases of BTC in 2015 when the price was much lower, but the point is.... just get started. Dollar cost average or just buy when you have funds available.

They are two different coins with two different niches - like comparing apples and oranges. While Bitcoin maximalists may imagine a world in which people only use bitcoin, the reality is that there are diverse financial niches which need customized cryptocurrencies optimized for each niche. 
Bitcoin currently is the leader in the "Digital gold" (AKA Store of Value) niche, which is very, very significant. And as such it is the flagship for cryptocurrency in general. But it is poorly suited at the moment for use as digital cash, for example, due to slow confirmation times, high fees and lack of privacy, in comparison with competitors.
By contrast Ethereum is the market leader in the Smart Contracts niche. This is also a huge deal, and over time the market will decide which is the larger niche so far as financial value is concerned. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:45:13
User Activated Soft Fork. A tool to defeat the mining cartel (Bitcoin Unlimited, which is apparently a reference to where fees are headed if they win) that is holding Bitcoin hostage. 
The cartel is trying to delay any upgrades because they are growing rich off the current fee situation (also, google ASICBOOST). They advocate a doubling of the block size, which has its own problems and would only be a short term solution. More importantly it keeps all fees flowing to them.
The development and user community favors Segwit followed by offchain solutions like Lightning Networks - you'll have to google those yourself please ;-) - to dramatically increase scaling. Litecoin has adopted them without issue so there is little risk. But the initial proposal to adopt Segwit was based on 95% miner acceptance, which was hopelessly naïve in hindsight. Thus the UASF, a tool by which the community can force the issue despite miner recalcitrance.
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:36:28
The risk of theft has to be balanced against the risk of loss. Making multiple backups increases risk of theft, but not doing backups increases risk of loss due to natural disaster, HD failure, etc. 
Best practices are to encrypt/password-protect the backup with a password you won't lose/forget, obscure it so it isn't easily recognized as an important file (for example, a zip file labeled "Church picnic pics" housing your wallet file), and using M of N multi-sig wallets with the keys distributed. (The latter is tedious for everyday use, but if you had a major stash of bitcoin you'd want to look into it.)
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:38:19
You need to read up on sidechains, Segwit and the Lightning Network, among other things.
That said, yes, on-chain there is definitely a scaling issue. I noticed this in an anecdotal way listening to altcoiners coping with multiple wallets on their laptops some months ago.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:02:00
Yes a 2 MB blocksize would help. Until adoption continues and creates the same situation in a matter of months. 
It is unrealistic to expect the miners will truly fork to 2 MB (even though that's what they publically favor) unless Bitcoin is truly threatened by a competitor such as Litecoin approaching it in popularity and market cap. That's the conclusion I've reached after following this situation for months.
The only other option is to force a scaling increase through against the defiance of the miners - that is where you need to read up on Segwit with UASF on BIP148:
Segwit provides the best way to enable Lightning Network scaling on a massive scale. This will drive fees way down, making the miners compete with anyone who wants to run a Lightning channel.

I agree. From what I'm reading there is no way software will be written, tested and deployed in time, which means they will start with a string of excuses and delays from their September timing. 2018 will roll around, newbies will still be screaming about the fees until there are no more newbies because they will all be going to another crypto instead.
Even waiting until August 2017 is going to make for a very painful couple of months. The miners need to stop considering the bitcoin community or developers as their enemy/rivals, and recognize that the soaring alt market is their real problem. The only way the miners are going to survive the onslaught of the alts is if they provide better service to the bitcoin community, enticing us to stay with them. Otherwise we can be perfectly happy using Ether/Zcash/Litecoin/Dogecoin/etc.

Well, I can't see the Imgur image (firewall), so I might be misunderstanding something on your end. I was just going by what nter said. But no, change addresses are handled automatically by the wallets. You only see them if you are looking up transaction details on the blockchain. 
It does tend to alarm new users, because they see more than they were intended sent out by their wallet when doing a transaction.... but the extra amount (besides TX fee and the intended spend) in the change address just stays with them in the wallet. That's what you get for looking under the hood and being curious. ;-)

No, simpler explanation: Kleinman died from the MRSA that was already killing him, and that he'd given up being treated for. The bullet hole in the mattress (if that's even what it was - could it have just been poked by some other sharp object in the past?) could have occurred years earlier for all we know. 
In this case the mention of a loaded gun is just a red herring. Kleinman was a military vet, an ex-police officer, and confined to a wheelchair. I'd be rather surprised if such a person _didn't_ keep a handgun for self-protection, even if he wasn't sitting on Satoshi's keys. The media  tends to fixate on guns, but the absence of a casing or any other evidence of a gunshot wound suggests that's not relevant here.

I have an Electrum wallet myself that only has dust left in it, leaving me in a similar situation. Yeah, I'm just sitting on it at this point waiting for a scaling solution. Start praying and working for implementation of BIP148 (and then Lightning Networks) would be my advice. It will be August at the earliest before we get some relief, but it's the best option IMO. 
In the meantime, the market for cryptocurrency is going gangbusters which is why we are in this mess in the first place. But the real action is in the alt markets like Litecoin, which already has Segwit+Lighting Network support. So I'd suggest directing your attention there in the time being with any investing.

BU is running out of excuses fast. Time for Roger and Jihan to drop the charades and admit to their useful idiot followers that the whole point all along was to block any scaling from happening so that mining fees would spike up and line their pockets.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:47:18
Sounds about right (you are not the first to recognize this). 
1. Keep in mind that with each halving the shrinking block reward would tend to drive this down (admittedly other factors like the fee market will drive it up).
2. This is why we need scaling, and in particular off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network.

Mark had a thread here not too long ago announcing his intention to give away the 140K of BTC to Mt. Gox customers/creditors rather than keeping it for himself (via "civil rehabilitation" or some such phrase). If he can follow through (there are legal/tax issues, sigh) this would be pretty spectacular of him as it's not required.
So I know a lot of people still have a lousy view of him, but I wonder here if Bashco's not out too far on a limb in making a connection between Ver and Karpeles' hiring based on Ver being on the board back in 2016. One could wish for better corroboration of a link at any rate.

Coinbase is the easiest onramp (and most efficient using the GDAX route), but you should probably find a few alternatives for if/when they screw something up and cut off your access. It's really frustrating (or worse) when you only have one account with one service and then they freeze it or have problems on their end that leave you without an alternative. Itbit, Bitstamp, Kraken and Coinflyer are alternatives in the US market. I'm sure there are a bunch more smaller ones that may be hungry for business as well. 
And don't store your coins on an exchange. Just don't.

That's my take as well. Antbleed. ASICBoost. Mining centralization. Altcoins getting Segwit and LN while Bitcoin gets dysfunctional scaling proposals. Don't get me wrong, it's still 30% of my crypto portfolio. But it's ridiculous, like watching passengers rave about the hot new sports car they are in, while you know that under the hood steam is outgassing madly and the gremlins in charge of fixing it are throttling each other or stuffing potatoes in the exhaust.

The UASF puts everything into the hands of the free market. You dump the coins you don't want, hodl and buy the ones you do. The miners choose the same, bearing in mind that mining worthless coins is not profitable in the long run. 
All we are asking is for the exchanges to give BIP148 a chance. They will NOT decide what happens - we as a community will do that with our buying and selling preferences.
Ironically your post is backwards - the only way Exchanges act as a cartel is if they collectively act to block BIP148, effectively collaborating with the miners to keep bitcoin throttled and under their veto control. The exchanges can only allow the possibility of change, they cannot force it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:34:03
So even if BIP148 only has, say, 25% of the hashrate on August 1, if it has economic support and "old" bitcoin does not, we will begin to see a divergence in the price of SW-bitcoin and Old-bitcoin. The miners will see this and mine on the chain giving them greater profit. 
So even if it is well below 50% hashrate, if the community wants Segwit and acts based on that preference (support the SW-BTC price while the old-BTC price declines), then it is going to get SW. The old chain will be driven from existence once 51% of mining hashrate switches to the side with greater economic support, no matter how long it takes. Do I have that all right?
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:42:45
The problem I have with this is the notion that any existing supercomputer would be capable of hacking Satoshi's files. Given that bitcoin encryption itself is too strong to be hacked by a universe-sized computer ( would we expect anything less of Satoshi's personal data, wallets, etc.? In which case a supercomputer is a waste of time. Better to buy up the property Kleiman lived at and spend the next ten years looking for a post-it note underneath the kitchen counter or something, with a passphrase on it.

Increasingly common. If you can share the TXID it will help folks diagnose your problem. Mostly it's due to fees being too low on your TX. See  for advice on setting the right fee.

I bought into Stellar a few weeks ago based on the upcoming airdrop to Bitcoin holders coming in June. At one point yesterday I was talking to my wife "OK, we're up another $10,000 since lunch... whoops, no another $3,000..." Then another $10K before I left the computer to get some work done outside.  Then when we sat down to dinner I checked my phone and casually mentioned we'd just lost $30,000 in a few minutes. Makes me feel like a whale, all on a $3K initial investment :-)
I've almost doubled my "BTC-Equivalent" holdings in crypto since February, even as the price of BTC has been rising. Just wish I'd moved even more forcefully when I saw this coming. I expect when BTC drops below 50% of total Crypto market cap it will drive a further shift to alts.

I know with my electrum wallet there is now a Replace by Fee option that lets you add to the fee if it is sitting too long. But it is not enabled by default! Maybe blockchain has it enabled?

Anyone in a free market has a say, as it should be. That is the power of the UASF. Saying only miners should have a vote in Bitcoin is like saying only bankers should be allowed a vote on financial matters for the entire populace.

That is an issue, but there is still a lot of time to get enough miners on board to start with. Once some miners sign on, and the others see the risk of staying with the fork rejected by the economic majority, they will feel the pressure. Keep in mind that if the SW fork ever grows longer it will cause the non-SW fork to evaporate.
And to get the ball rolling, there's always the option of rented hashpower, just to insure that there is some significant hashpower at activation of BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:42:45
So HODL your BIP148 segwit coins, and dump the non-SW coins ASAP. Got it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:49:38
Miners will have to follow the money. If they want to keep mining the old unchanged, 'bitcoin classic' with no scaling in sight after we've dumped it to oblivion, they have that freedom (until they declare bankruptcy). 
Everyone is going to have the same choice: favor the scaled up bitcoin with segwit (which pretty much everyone says they want) and LN capability, or stay with a coin that literally has no prospects beyond years more of empty promises and obfuscation and delays. This isn't hard to work out.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:17:43
If hashrate is close I agree. So if BIP 148 gets to around 40% (or starts close to that), they'll be switching to hedge against such losses and that will force the issue real quick. But if the hashrate is only 10% or 20% they might be more comfortable thinking they can outlast the minority chain, particularly since it will be struggling with blocks far above 10 minutes until the next difficulty adjustment.
So timing relative to difficulty adjustments may be key, and economic support will definitely be key. I'm confident most BTC users want segwit - but are they willing to actively support this particular effort on behalf of segwit? My gut says yes, but I'd like to see data, in particular are their people with cold feet who say they are pro-SW but can't support it in this form?
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:00:36
The relationship between bitcoin users and miners is like that between customers and a store. In the event of a conflict over the service being provided by the merchant, why should the customers have to compromise? When they can just go next door and find better service elsewhere?
Why should I put up with $2 fees and slow confirmation times (and multi-day delays if I go short on the fees), when I can go next door to Dogecoin and get much faster confirmations for less than a penny? 
"Well, because EVERYONE shops with us!" huffs the Bitcoin store owner. And that's a really lousy answer. Because every day it's becoming less true, and it begs the question - why should everyone keep shopping where the service is lousy?
Miners, stop thinking of yourself as an aggrieved party and start thinking in terms of customer service, before we customers go shopping elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:47:17
In hindsight it was obvious we were due for a correction. Just a question of when. Kudos to those who called it, and to those who just bought in before the drop or sold low, you have my condolences. But the bagholders can HODL with the knowledge that Bitcoin has a way of rewarding patience.

I paid $30 back when BTC was around $230* in mid 2015, so the premium has remained roughly the same over all this time. I had assumed it would vanish, but for whatever reason it is persisting pretty consistently.
*For readers, a share of GBTC is supposed to equate to 1/10 of a bitcoin IIRC.
@_date: 2017-05-08 17:22:24
It is probably largely random variation, but the lack of decline in BU's hashrate should be cause for concern. They can continue to hold Bitcoin hostage, and if they can come up with a bit more hashrate they could attempt a hostile forking action. 
I could see such an attempt being made if BTC's dominance drops below 50% and the price begins declining, and if BU really is dumb enough to imagine they are the solution. This could happen pretty quickly at this point. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 05:30:37
Letting a mining cartel dictate everything is what violates the spirit of Bitcoin. A UASF only works if it has majority economic support.

Very good. I just wish  this could be happening much faster, but as you point out there are things that cannot be rushed. 
Do you have any suggestions or ideas of what could be done in the following scenario? I'm not predicting it will occur, but I don't think it's that wild of a scenario either:
1. LTC activates LN and doubles or triples in value again in the next week.
2. Ethereum and Ripple likewise rise as the BTC Dominance index drops below 50%. Passive BTC holders see the headlines about this, and they and remaining BTC maximalists shift funds into Alts also as a hedge - thus accelerating the downtrend.
3. Additional Fiat-altcoin gateways for Top 10 alts continue to proliferate; exchanges begin offering Alt markets involving Ethereum, LTC, and other alts as base pairs in place of BTC. So BTC is no longer needed to buy Alts.
4. This dries up the BTC pipeline to the alts, leading to a price crash and further accelerating the shift from BTC to alt markets. BTC begins to plummet...
I could see this crisis unfolding in a matter of days now, based on how things have run the last few months. In this case, if there was a willingness to talk and consider emergency options by all parties, what might be done on a very short notice if BU remained unwilling to accept SW? (Or even if they did and it was apparent that 95% was still out of reach?)

None of the exchanges have publicly announced their plans for BIP148 so far as I can recall. Keep in mind it is easy for individuals to voice support. Businesses that need to rewrite code and actually do stuff to be sure they are ready will need weeks more time.

I'd say the UASF is our only hope. If you are pinning your hopes on bigger blocks you had best hope years of industry stagnation on storage and bandwidth improvements come to an end and Mooore's law comes back alive. I don't see that happening.
Plus big blocks just keeps everything under the control of increasingly centralized miners. That will be the death of Bitcoin if it is not countered with a PoW change. So I guess I'd agree to a block size increase only if it was done in conjunction with a PoW change.

There will only be 2 coins if there is sufficient economic support for the non-SW fork. Other than nostalgia what reason would there be to stick with "Bitcoin Classic" and its lack of scalability?
I suppose Bitcoin Classic could announce bigger blocks and so forth, but then they'd just discover the arguments against bigger blocks were based on real reasons and they'd lose more ground. Unlike ETC, which survives based on adherence to an arguably critical principle, Bitcoin Classic would just be a rump of anti-Core sentiment and conspiracy without any point to it after a while.

There are actually a number of issues that need to be resolved, not just the scaling issue everyone has on their mind. Other hurdles:
1. 10 minute confirmation times (0-confirm techniques exist, but are not widely used)
2. Lack of simple interfaces for paying at checkout with bitcoin (there has been some progress with this, but few bitcoin users can whip out a smartphone and pay with a mobil wallet at the moment, and few merchants are set up to receive payment easily as well.)
3. Need more widely available invoicing software and other back end systems for tracking BTC payments, issuing receipts and so on. Again, there has been some work here, but it's a chicken-and-egg problem. Once the scaling issue is resolved hopefully more progress will be made on stuff like this.

Can someone explain how Barry Silbert's agreement interferes with or challenges implementation of BIP148? It seems to me the community should just shrug off the backroom deal and keep pushing exchanges and other major players to announce support for BIP148.
@_date: 2017-05-18 03:23:43
I doubt it. According to Coin.Dance it was from an anonymous pool not ViaBTC or Antpool or other known Bitmain affiliates. Nor was it signaling for anything - neither Segwit nor BU. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:03:35
Thus the need to keep pressure on. I see no advantage to Barry's proposal over the UASF. A 2 MB or other blocksize change can still be considered as needed down the road, and BIP148 can't be held hostage or altered based on one excuse or another the way this agreement can. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:43:41
If you run a full node you can signal for it.
If you don't, you can upvote threads here, spread the word, ask exchanges to support it and so on. 
And when the time comes, if there is a fork you can HODL your BIP148 coins and buy more of the same, and dump your non-BIP148 coins. That's what I mean by putting our money where our mouth is.

BIP148 or bust. Because come August and beyond, I'm not supporting these greedy miners any more one way or another. I've no problem with making an honest buck and miners who behave honestly, but this manipulation and attempts to control bitcoin for their own personal gain have got to be defeated.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:39:34
What is the evidence that Segwit will actually be activated with this agreement? It lowers the threshold from 95% to 80%, but we all know this means Jihan can continue to hold veto power over it. Moreover the agreement says nothing about blocking covert ASICBoost.
BIP148 addresses these issues, and much faster than the agreement does. Why should we be forced to wait and trust in the promises of those who have been stalling Segwit for a year when we can have Segwit sooner and block covert ASICBoost sooner?

No discussion of smart contracts. Dismissive of any purpose for money besides as a store of value. Is this what Bitcoin maximalism has devolved to? Repeating the platitudes of 2014? Just sticking a head in the sand while shouting "HODL!" and "Network effect!" and trying to ignore the shrinking number on the Bitcoin Dominance Index?
I'll grant that Bitcoin has proved more resilient in the face of the scaling impasse than I guessed a few months ago. But there is still no light at the end of that tunnel, and every day brings news of progress among the alts that is lacking in Bitcoin.

We are seeing a constant barrage of complaints about high fees from both new users and older users who haven't been paying attention, while billions of dollars are flowing thru bitcoin straight into anything that breathes in the altcoin market. Bitcoin is now pretty much worthless except as a rarely traded store of value for significant amounts, and for trading into altcoins - if you can get your BTC into an exchange and the exchange isn't crashing due to high volumes.
I shifted heavily out of BTC in favor of alts several months ago. Insofar as others saw the same thing (that the scaling debate would drag on for months at least), such a shift would inherently depress the price of BTC and raise the alt market. 
BTC has done well, but consider this - about two months ago I noted that the 100th coin on Coinmarketcap had a market cap of $900,000. Today the 100th coin has a market cap of $7 million. People are literally throwing their bitcoin funds at anything that moves in the  alt market in preference to staying with bitcoin.

Try looking for a "Coin Control" feature with your wallet. Coin Control lets you select specific inputs for a given transaction. In my experience with Electrum it always tries to pick the most efficient ones available though, so what you are describing surprises me.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:13:13
We've waited years already, and the miners (or at least Wu and his associates) will find new excuses and reasons to delay. That's how we got into this mess in the first place. They have no incentive to increase network capacity while enjoying the high fee market, so long as they have suckers propping up the price with the promise that they will "do something"... eventually...

I'm not familiar with Armory, but other wallets provide a seed (set of 12 words for example) that you should store somewhere safe, from which a wallet can be restored in the event of a HD failure. Did Armory provide a seed when you were setting it up? You can also backup the wallet file itself somewhere safe.

I would ask how the topic of procuring a fresh computer came up, and ask him to think about it very carefully. Did Gavin think to ask for a new computer all by himself, without any prompting whatsoever? Or did Craig or an associate casually mention or bring up this topic in any fashion whatsoever, planting the idea of it in your mind?
It would be a typical scammer trick to do so, so subtly that the victim thinks it was their own idea, and that by demanding a new computer he's somehow guaranteeing an un-hacked system.
Shrink-wrapping would mean almost nothing. I've got a roll lying around from when I used to sell firewood to campers near my old house. Could probably use a hair dryer or something equally simple to apply it and make a tampered computer look "factory-sealed".

Sorry to hear about the untimely death. :-(
You will need to try to identify where the bitcoins were held. Their computer, if accessible, should provide clues.(Side note: Everyone should leave instructions with their will for this kind of stuff to save their loved ones a LOT of trouble later on.)
Look for wallet software on their computer, or check email for emails from online bitcoin exchanges or wallet services that will provide clues as to their activities. Have someone you can trust who is knowledgeable about bitcoin help search the computer and email. Perhaps you will find a spreadsheet or other log where they tracked their bitcoin finances that will help spell it out as well. Also - check their browsing history on their phone/computer for clues as well.
Also note that bitcoin may be held in physical form as a "paper wallet" containing public/private keys (long strings of text/numbers). They would have kept this in a safe place. 
Once you find the wallets or know what online wallets/exchanges were used, you'll need to know their password to access the funds and transact them. Your guess is good as mine as to where to find such passwords. A paper wallet will enable you to directly transact though without needing any other information, once you loaded the keys from it into a software wallet you set up.
Hope this helps or at least provides some clues. Best wishes with it...

No sarcasm. Think it through. After years of stagnation, people will have a choice: an actual bitcoin with Segwit and ready for the Lightning Network, or nothing. Which do you think people will go for overwhelmingly after months of high fees and delayed confirmations?
Ironically, if miners fail to switch to the SW fork, we'll be left with the status quo of low support for SW among the miners, but also low support for BU/larger blocks - too low to activate. So the alternative really looks like _nothing_ at this point if BIP148 fails (as is already clear from how things are going since the Barry Silbert announcement on that front).

I prefer Electrum personally.
Correct, you don't need to back up the wallet after every transaction. The wallet is basically a tool enabling you to make transactions and post them to the blockchain, which is where your bitcoins truly reside. Bitcoins don't sit "in" your wallet. 
I would strongly suggest backing up to something beyond a USB though. I've had bad experiences with them getting corrupted or just going dead after a year or so of disuse. Cloud storage (with encryption) is a good option, or maybe DVD's or a HD that is stowed offsite in a secure location. (I always tell people not to keep all their backups in the same physical location. Having 5 backups in your house is no good if the house burns down, for example.)

That really doesn't make sense, given they are physically invested in hardware for mining bitcoin. Why would they invest in a competitor to their own hardware investment and daily revenue?
What I believe they are trying to do is keep the price propped up by always having some solution in sight, but not actually implementing any scaling increase. That keeps the fee markets elevated so they rake in the TX fees on top of the base block reward. It's parasitism and it works, unless/until they kill the host.

In the short run. I use Coinbase myself and used to store some coins with them. HOWEVER, you are taking the following risks:
1. Risk of a major hack of Coinbase - they no doubt have great security, but are also a great big juicy target.
2. Risk of your account/PW being hacked.
3. Risk of Coinbase rightly or wrongly thinking you have violated terms of service. This is a much bigger deal than you might think. People are getting banned from coinbase for gambling, but even for buying gift cards with coins from Coinbase. Or they might list your personal checking account as a business account (which is what happened to me, and they never did fix it until I closed the account entirely), which can lead to hassles.
There's also the long period in which my account was locked down because supposedly someone from my household had called to dispute a BTC buy I had made at one point. I'm quite certain neither my wife nor I made any such call so I'm mystified how they came up with this, and it eventually got fixed, but it was a real hassle.
4. DDOS or other attacks on Coinbase rendering you unable to access your account (probably at the worst possible time). 
The point being, they aren't likely to pull an exit scam and disappear with your money, but the odds of some headaches and hassles are higher than you might think. Thus the emphasis on taking control of your own coins. I really only mention the alternative of leaving coins with them because some people need time to research how to safely store their own coins without screwing it up, and some people are inept enough (and know it) that they just can't trust themselves with managing their own coins.

It occurs to me with the rapid increase of the price of bitcoin, there are probably some people out there who have invested "X" dollars or euros, etc., in a cloud mining scheme and are getting a profit as measured in fiat. But if they'd just bought bitcoin directly they'd have been even better off. Cloud mining is profitable for the operators selling the hashrate, not the buyers. If it were otherwise they'd stop selling.

ASICBoost gives Jihan a huge advantage that fills his coffers while driving other miners out of business if nothing changes, leading to centralized mining under his domination.

I suggest you actually read up on segwit and the downsides to a blocksize increase. A blocksize increase sounds like the simple solution and so newbies and naive users tend to favor it, but the community rejected it a long time ago in favor of segwit. Now it's just a mining cartel along with occasional shills and newbies holding things up.
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:54:54
I suspect you are in a shrinking minority. I've used them since 2014, but they make things a pain with their inaccurate harassment. They kept insisting my personal checking account was a "business account" despite my telling them it is not. I don't have a business and never have! There's no sane reason for anyone with accurate info to think otherwise if they had looked at the transactions - just salary deposits, HSA transfers, checks to church weekly, credit card payments and a little miscellaneous stuff like a normal person has.
Then there is the time I was locked out for months because they claimed someone contacted them using my phone to dispute a transaction. When I denied it they said it must have been my wife. My wife hates computers (and they hate her back) so she leaves all this crypto stuff to me and would never have done any such thing without talking to me, and confirmed that was the case.
So I still have an account with them, but I really can't trust them and am glad to see competition springing up. Now if Gemini just had a referral program that matched Coinbase...

This isn't quite the same thing, but my understanding is that Bitmain does produce 70% of mining ASICs. 
Whether it is Jihan alone or with a cartel of miners, the salient fact is that the miners are blocking any and all scaling progress so that they can continue enjoying the spiked up fee market. 
A UASF provides a means for non-miners (who after all are 99% of the bitcoin community) to have a voice in this process. The only other option is for bitcoin users to leave _en masse_ for other crypto that is providing dramatically better service until the miners come to their senses. (I've gotten in the habit of shifting funds between exchanges in Dogecoin and Litecoin because it is just so much faster and cheaper.)

Your PSA is good but only tells half the story! You should balance it by including Risk of Loss in addition to the risk of theft you cover:

2. Lost software wallet (crashed computer/hard drive, accidentally deleted or sold, etc.).
3. Physical destruction of computer, storage media or paper wallet from flood/fire/tornado/war/etc.

OK, if you want to make a "blockchain" that is only found in a centralized massive data center processing multi-terabyte blocks then you can have a "global on chain" scaling solution - but not one that anyone here is interested in.

Right.

I don't see why that should be the case. If all the craziness we've been through in years past didn't finish off Bitcoin, I doubt another UASF for a popular feature will do the trick.
At any rate, if the UASF fails, I don't see myself holding any significant quantity of bitcoin in the future. I did very well for myself predicting the rise of the altcoins in early March  ( and predict that a failure to enact BIP148 will essentially finish Bitcoin off.
EDIT: It may seem strange for me to predict BTC's demise after noting its robustness up til now. But the reasoning is simple: Bitcoin survived earlier turmoil because despite its problems it was a better alternative to fiat and had no serious competition. But now the serious competition is arriving, and it must improve scaling or the competition will kill it off - and such events do not take long in cryptocurrency.

Yes, all three (Trump, Sanders, Clinton) favor larger, more intrusive government entailing higher government spending. They only differ on the details. And none are willing to commit political suicide by jacking taxes to the moon to cover their spending. So all of them will be going down this path of printing fiat to cover their budget, enslaving future generations with debt to keep the party going now.
I often hear bitcoiners look forward to "cashing out" of their bitcoin after a big increase in the price of bitcoin. But if bitcoin does spike massively, it will be because fiat is dying. At that point, no matter what the price you'd be throwing away something valuable (bitcoin) for something fast becoming worthless (fiat) if you sold.
To paraphrase the Russian scientist in the movie Firefox... you must learn to _think_ in bitcoin. Not fiat. _Think_ in bitcoin, using it as your mental standard. Even among bitcoiners very few do this.

The fees are high now because Bitcoin is currently limited to 3-4 transactions/second (around 300K/day). We've been hitting that limit for months now, meaning that if you want your  transaction to go through, you need to outbid someone else whose transaction is delayed or doesn't go through at all.
The UASF implements Segwit which gives a boost to capacity around 2X as people begin using wallets that make use of the segwit transaction upgrade. So that increases transaction capacity, reducing the congestion and letting fees decline to where they were a year or so ago.
Moreover Segwit paves the way for the best implementation of the Lightning Network, which will be ready soon. It provides for off-chain transactions that boost network capacity by hundreds or thousands of times --  thus ensuring fees will stay low in the future.
That's why if you want low fees (ie., bitcoin users) you want BIP148. And if you want high fees (ie., bitcoin miners) you want the current legacy chain with no changes. Hope this makes sense.

Short answer yes, if you follow the directions for what to do when you lose or break the hardware wallet. The odds of which are fairly high over a lifetime. Being your own bank is liberating but some people have trouble adjusting to the responsibility and not having an 800 number to call and save them when they screw up.
If you candidly admit to yourself that you would have trouble with this (for example, someone who loses their keys every other week or has shady friends around the house a lot), you may need an alternate strategy for securing your bitcoins. While keeping your bitcoins offline on properly secured and backed up hardware, paper or offline wallets is undoubtedly best for most people, some people probably really are best off just using a professional online service and just keeping their password secure (with 2FA).

The potential exists today, and every day. Why should the unveiling of Satoshi lead to an expectation of imminent sale of most/all of the coins? Those are two logically unrelated events. Satoshi could sell the coins at any time without any warning. Or he could come forward and unveil himself without selling any coins. At best there is a correlation, but a weak one.
So people might react to news of a Satoshi identification with this fear, but I don't think their reaction would be very reasonable.

It's a horrible "investment". Why on earth would someone let you use their mining equipment when they could just mine at a profit themselves? The only real answer: Because they can sucker you into paying more for the rental then the equipment will make. They win, you lose.
Just buy the crypto you want on an exchange. Boring, but cheaper. If you want to mine so you learn more about crypto along the way (which is what I did in 2014), build your own rig and do it as a hobby, because you will make little if any money on it.

Totally different situation, and I say that as someone who has held ETC in preference to ETH (though I now am bearish on the whole smart contract thing). 
ETC offered immutability in the wake of The DAO welfare bailout, decentralized governance rather than "king" Buterin, and a coin cap in place of Ethereum's open-ended coin inflation. This makes ETC frankly superior in its fundamentals. 
By comparison BitcoinCash offers _nothing_. An 8 MB blocksize for a coin that won't need it, authored in a mad rush by a 3rd rate dev team splintered from a faction that has been trying to stall development on bitcoin ever since SW put covert ASICboost at risk. It's just an attack on Bitcoin and nothing more.

The wallet is probably doing its best automatically. There are probably a lot of people with dust in their wallets who don't realize it, because they've never emptied it.

True story:
My wife has been asking about cashing some crypto out. My intention is to live off fiat investments, with 100% of my crypto portfolio being for charity. So I thought to cash out an amount equal to my total fiat investment into crypto + $1000 last night for a first round of charity. That way even if all crypto evaporated overnight, we'd never regret it. 
I prayed about it and went to bed. Woke up 6 hours later and checked my crypto portfolio value. It was up by an amount equal to my intended withdrawal + another $1000. I'm taking that as confirmation to follow through. ;-)

Merchants need to start offering a 2-3% discount to people paying with bitcoin. It's ridiculous that they don't have to pay credit card fees or mess with bounced checks, counterfeit cash, forgeries, expired credit cards, armored cars for cash deposit, and so on, with bitcoin, but they charge bitcoiners as much as fiat users.
Bitcoin will catch on once merchants give consumers a reason to use it. But so long as merchants prefer paying credit card fees and messing with bounced and forged checks and counterfeit money and so on, bitcoin adoption will languish.

To explain, when a Bitcoin transaction occurs the ledger needs to track where the bitcoins are coming from and where they are going. There has to be complete traceability for every bitcoin back to when it was first mined.
So it says in effect "Sending 10 bitcoins from this old transaction to the sending address, on to the new address." Except that usually the prior transaction it is drawing from didn't have exactly 10 bitoins in it. Maybe it had 12. So the new transaction actually says "From this old transaction to the sending address, taken 10 bitcoins and send it to the recipient, and take the other 2 and send them back to myself at this new address." That latter one is the change address, and those funds stay with the wallet sending the coins.
If someone steals your private key, it's a safe bet they'll take everything in one go.

I've used it 40+ times and it's an excellent service. Like anything else there are quirks and headaches, but I really do save 15-20% per order so that makes it all worthwhile. 
If you are in a hurry, do the instant purchase option of 5% or whatever. With experience you'll learn what you can get away with at higher savings. My last couple 15-18% orders were picked up within a few hours. Since many buyers are Amazon Prime members, you can actually get your order faster than you would have gotten it buying it yourself.
Just keep in mind to communicate proactively, if for example you'll be away from home when the order arrives. Keeps the bitcoin buyers from getting antsy when they can see the order has arrived but you still haven't confirmed it...

ASIC = Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. Pretty much by definition a bitcoin mining ASIC is going to be the best for this particular function, because they are custom-designed to do that with maximum efficiency. A general purpose chip will never be as efficient.
(Side note: Folks like me favor a policy (PoW change) of hostility towards ASICs in favor of returning mining to CPU/GPU based paradigms. This doesn't mean picking a new algorithm and then forgetting about it. It means being ready and willing as a community to keep changing the algorithm in a non-predictable manner at whatever frequency is needed to prevent anyone from designing, testing and deploying ASICs for bitcoin mining.)

Do what FluxSeer suggests - note that you have to check the Replace By Fee box in the options before you do the TX. Your money is not stuck permanently, after the TX is dropped from the mempool Blockchain should show it again.

The miners will only budge if forced by market conditions. Right now bitcoin price is growing well despite the congestion. Given the TX fee was 5 cents not so long ago, I suspect the miners know even a fairly dramatic growth in volume would not make up for the current fee earnings if congestion were eased and the fee went back to a few pennies.
I think we need to see Litecoin (the obvious alternative in my view) start taking chunks of Bitcoin's market share and have the BTC price falter to really force the issue.

Right, the burden of proof will be on the account owners. And since BTC-e is identified as a money laundering organization they will basically be assuming you are a criminal and it will be up to you to prove otherwise. So it will be very expensive (legal costs), very time consuming (years), and you'd better have a way to prove your coins were obtained from legit activities from A to Z.

I refunded the Ebay customers, and then spent months arguing with Amazon before Purse stepped in with a resolution. 
I had gotten the gifts cards from all different purchasers so even if one was using a stolen CC or similar, it was over the top to cancel them all.

A couple points:
1. A TX only lets you see how much BTC a spender and recipient have associated with one public key. So their statement is inaccurate, akin to saying you know how much money a person has because you got a peak in their wallet (never minding their bank account, investment accounts etc.)
2. There's no sane reason to believe the network will stop functioning when the last bitcoin is mined. Who came up with that??
3. It fails to mention SW/LN even as an aside.

Simply moving the bitcoins does not constitute a transaction, so no, there are no taxable events with taking control of your own bitcoins. It's when you sell them that taxes are due.

Diversify using the altcoin markets (Poloniex is best). They've enjoyed a dramatically stronger run than bitcoin, and as bitcoin owners feel wealthy they will keep driving alts up as they try to diversify a little themselves.

The real risk as I see it is the competition from other cryptos overwhelming Bitcoin such that it loses the much-ballyhooed "Network effect" advantage. This could happen pretty much any time now with ETH at 60% of BTC's market cap and neck-and-neck in daily volume.
Once Bitcoin loses its mystique, some problems come up:
1. 10 minute block times make it the slowest cryptocurrency out there that I can think of, even if TX backlogs vanish completely.
2. Until BTC actually gets segwit and doesn't die off, the fees are also the worst out there AFAIK compared to any other crypto.
Yes Bitcoin has great mining hashrate, a deep dev team, name recognition and so on. But if it is the slowest and most expensive option out there, it's going to be hard for the average user to choose to use it as exchanges add ETH and LTC and so on for direct fiat purchases and as basemarket coins for trading with other alts. 
I believe this is largely what lies behind the rise of the alt markets the last couple months. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:45:09
Your bitcoins will not become obsolete, but worst case a fork could occur in which you have bitcoins on each fork. The dominant fork would remain known as "bitcoin"; if the lesser fork somehow survived because it had adequate miner and economic support you would also have coins on it, known by some new name.
This happened with Ethereum in the aftermath of The DAO hack last year - owners of Ethereum wound up also owning Ethereum Classic. It is unlikely this will happen with Bitcoin but it is possible. In such a case you'll need to read up quite a bit more once it happens to figure out what to do.

The first BIP148 mining pool was just announced here a few minutes ago and is running. So there will be some hashrate for sure from supporters. 
But if it is very low, blocks will take a very long time (100 minutes average at 10% hashrate for example), which will cause a major short-term headache. The other chain will also suffer to a corresponding degree. So best not to be planning TX in early August if you can avoid it.
Eventually both chains will reach the next difficulty adjustment point (every 2016 blocks), which will shift things to make blocks come a lot closer to every 10 minutes. Getting to that point may be the challenge.
So why would a miner choose the BIP148 chain? Consider if the BIP148 coin is valued at $2000, but the legacy chain is dumped to $200 dollars. If most hashrate stays with the legacy chain it has near-normal block times, but the miners are far below breakeven in terms of their mining costs. They are losing money leaving their miners turned on if nothing changes.
If they switch over, until the next difficulty adjustment they will earn money at the higher price value. Blocks will be slower, but they will have less competition so that will balance out.
The turning point comes when the difficulty adjusts down. Miners from the legacy chain will flood onto the segwit chain because (1) the coin value is much higher, and (2) the lower difficulty means they can mine a LOT more blocks until difficulty adjusts again. Instead of blocks every 100 minutes, we'll have the opposite happening - blocks every 2-3 minutes for example.
By the point of the next difficulty adjustment I think it will be all over, because when the miners switched over, the remainder were left mining a still-unvalued coin, with slow block times that kill off any residual interest in maintaining it. (Note that without checkpointing the old chain will cease to exist anyway once it is surpassed in amount of proof of work.)

What objection can they possibly have now that seven altcoins have already adopted Segwith with no issues? (Unless you count major increases in their value to be an "issue.")
I've seen no evidence that anyone can object to Segwit now except on the grounds that it cuts into the miners outrageous profits.

He's playing people for fools and keeps moving the goalposts. Check out Eric Lombrozo's article on this point:
If I were a miner (and had no conscience) I'd be doing just what Wu is doing: dangle carrots like 2MB blocks to convince people I really want to scale and that a deal is possible. That way people don't panic and leave, tanking the price. But in reality I'd make sure no scaling happens so the fee market kept spiking up, lining my pockets until people figured it out.

Seems reasonable to me. I always advise to beware two risks: the risk of theft, and the risk of loss.
Using a Trezor as you describe protects you from risk of theft IF you keep the seeds safe. Is the book they provide unobtrusive? Or is it titled in big gold letters "MY SECRET BITCOIN SEED. TOP SECRET!!!" If remotely like the latter, I'd write the seed on a scrap piece of paper, title it in a way that you will remember how important it is but that is not clear to a burglar going through your stuff, and stow it in your safe place.
That way you are protected. Even if a meteor smashes your bank you still have the seed. Only a disaster that takes out both your bank and your home would risk your bitcoins. If you consider that a significant risk (and think on the timescale of your whole life), you might also put the seed in secured cloud storage in a similarly obscure way that no one would be able to guess what it was.

Bitmain has been screwing users by blocking progress on scaling, so they can force higher fees on us - and that's in addition to ASICBoost and whatever they had in mind for Antbleed. I'd sooner compromise with a mugger.
I'm not against miners in general, but Bitmain is playing dirty and the idea that they should be rewarded through some kind of compromise is garbage. They are a blight on Bitcoin and we'll all be better off if they can somehow be run off.

Transaction capacity has been maxed out for months, leading to spiking mining fees (to move your bitcoin) and a constant stream of complaints here from new or even experienced users who set the fee too low. Then they panic as their TX gets hung up for up to a week in limbo. 
It's ruined the plans of companies wanting to offer services payable in bitcoin, since no one wants to buy coffee or a typical retail purchase if they have to pay $2 for a transaction fee on top of the purchase price. This is why Bitcoin has been lagging the altcoin market so badly, as people get into bitcoin, and then move on to alts with lower fees and faster confirmation times and less congestion.
@_date: 2017-05-17 14:22:04
I said the same thing a year ago when people were reversing their 5 cent TX fee and the payment they were trying to make. The idea still makes sense, but the max cap probably does need to be able to adjust due to market conditions. 
I'm worried now that the real crisis is only beginning due to continued on-boarding by Japanese and by all the attention brought by the ransomware news. A lot of new people oblivious to the fees issue flooding in and then trying to move their BTC, on top of continued bullishness, could have us all wishing fees were as low as they are now in another week.

I agree with Maegfaer - doing nothing is the riskier option so far as economic failure goes. Bitcoin is currently being propped up by hordes of naive new investors. What happens as they gradually learn about the mess going on under the hood? 
I figure by August if BIP148 doesn't take hold, it's time to bail for Litecoin. Let Wu and his shills ride bitcoin down into oblivion. But I'm not going to line their pockets any more while they sneer at me over twitter.

I don't necessarily disagree, but I would point out that with Segwit now on Litecoin and other coins, all their other excuses about SW have been debunked anyway. Not that that will stop them. The whole point of BU is to block scaling to keep the fee market spiking up as long as possible. Any "useful idiot" BU supporters who think their mining cartel really wants to provide a scalability solution to reduce fees is not thinking it through.
That means we just need to push this through as quickly as may be done without compromising the security of Bitcoin, ignoring the smoke and mirrors offered by BU.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:02:04
That would be funny if after all the shouting, a minority hashrate chain just had the good fortune to reorg the non-SW chain after the first couple of blocks. (It will take more than 1, orphans happen all the time. But after 3-6 blocks things a reorg would be rather painful for the legacy chain.)

Seems to me that if a customer  has verified their identity and home address with Coinbase, then it should not matter if they are traveling. 
Coinbase seems to be going way too far in being an active enforcer of laws, rather than trying to comply with them. Law enforcement/regulatory agencies should be careful not to push companies into such a cumbersome and hostile relationship with the public. 
It's not a private businesses' job to make sure that everything a customer does is legal, or shouldn't be. Especially when it doesn't really have the ability to accurately identify what customers are doing and ends up making sweeping prohibitions of all kinds of harmless activity.

This. But insofar as the white paper is still a key document, I'd also offer the following:

2. A clear identification of hurdles and challenges to be overcome in implementation. What things are involved that "have never been done before?" What are the unknowns?
3. Merits of the project - a clear definition and discussion of what the project can do that is useful, and how it compares to competing ideas/implementations. What problem is the paper trying to solve? Why is it important?

Nope. Google "End of Moore's Law." Or just look at the specs of the computers you've bought over the last ten years. I can't figure out why people keep thinking their systems are rapidly getting better.

They can try to regulate the interfaces between bitcoin and fiat currency, but good luck trying to regulate transactions within digital currency itself.

If that were true... explain Ethereum's primacy over Ethereum Classic. Explain Ripple. 
And explain how a UASF is an example of centralization - it looks like the exact opposite to me. What we have now with a handful of miners blocking progress, that's centralization.
BIP does not impact immutability, unless you have in mind that someone may trade on the legacy chain and have their trades get reorg'd out of existence if no checkpoint is made. But we have 3 months to get the word out and alert people so they don't make such mistakes. And this is exactly why we are trying to get exchanges and businesses to be clear with their customers about how they will be handling BIP148.

There has been a tremendous amount of global buildup in interest in Bitcoin, and this drop was just profit-taking not driven by any real shock like Mt. Gox. In hindsight it was terribly obvious: the steady growth accelerated as media exposure picked up, peaking with the Consensus conference. With a lot of people talking about Bitcoin maybe reaching $3000, a wave of profit-taking just short of that potential peak in the aftermath of the excitement made perfect sense. I feel like an idiot for not expecting it.
Anyway... given the lack of a real shock event and the growth pattern the last couple months, I'm basically expecting a return to 1-3% daily growth again, which means we'll be at a new all time high in less than 2 weeks. All else being equal....

People would start making SW transactions, so the additional load would start immediately decreasing. This would allow the backlog to work itself off. Maybe not quite as fast as 2 MB blocks, but it would still happen in a matter of days as people took advantage of SW.

So I suppose I shouldn't mention this:
The last couple years I've spent roughly $6000 on Amazon purchases using Purse.io. Conservatively I've saved 15% after fees. My habit has always been to immediately spend as much buying more bitcoin as I would have spent in fiat on the Amazon goods themselves. (So if I bought a $100 item with $85 in bitcoin, I buy $100 in bitcoin back, gaining at extra $15 in bitcoin.)
So... that means I bought ~$900 in BTC with my 15% savings, which I've gained 1000% on all else being equal, taking me to $9000 earned versus the $6000 I spent. In other words, I've gotten all my Amazon stuff for free and $3000 on top of it, all because I used Purse/bitcoin! 
Wheee! :-D
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:26:18

This is a battle of bitcoin users versus miners. The miners are incentivized to keep the fee market elevated by choking off scaling, while always promising in some fashion that they have a plan to move forward so the price doesn't tank. (But then notice that nothing ever does actually happen). 
So the whole point of the UASF is to force economic reality on the miners, short of everyone dumping their bitcoin and leaving in disgust. But it will take some time for most miners to admit defeat and adopt the UASF. In that interim blocks will be very slow (for example 100 minutes/block at 10% hashrate) on the UASF chain.
I don't think this will stop the UASF, but it will drag things out. Finding hashrate for the August 1 activation should be somewhat of a priority to help with the initial blocktime hit.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:28:21
NY Times has got to be among the most incompetent news organizations out there.
1. Follows a narrative years out of date in painting bitcoin as nothing more than a tool for criminals.
2. Get Bitcoin and bitcoin (capitalization) usage backwards.
3. No attempt to distinguish between nodes and mining ASICS, giving readers the clear impression that you still mine with ordinary computers; also no mention of mining pools - instead they say "one of the computers" gets the block reward every 10 minutes.
The overall tone of the article is very dark - the NYT clearly wants to send a message to its "sophisticated" readers: Bitcoin is beneath you. It's dirty, leave it alone.
Their loss.
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:44:25
This was inevitable as the cryptocurrency industry pursues more niches, but BU certainly has accelerated it by stalling bitcoin and forcing people to look for opportunities elsewhere when it comes to scaling. 
That said, I'm surprised that Litecoin is tumbling. It is the nearest to Bitcoin functionally - indeed, I now call Litecoin "what Bitcoin should have been." I would expect a shift to it before seeing people flock to Ripple of all things.

Are you new here and unfamiliar with what has been happening the last two years with Bitcoin?
On the assumption that you are, or need a refresher, let me point out that it was long ago recognized that Bitcoin needed to scale before transactions became bottlenecked. After a good deal of discussion and exploring alternatives the software development community chose Segwit at the best option for scaling (while also providing bug fixes and preparing the way for off-chain scaling). 
Now we have Bitmain and Ver and Wright, who have been delaying Segwit for many months. Fees have skyrocketed enriching their mining operations. It's very likely they are using ASICboost via patent infringement to gain a dramatic advantage in mining profitability, which provides further incentive to block SW at all costs. Now we see them continuing to make credible threats to derail scaling except under terms that they will control the protocol and keep all TX on-chain to prevent competition.
The upshot is the Bitcoin community is being ripped off with high fees, not due to some unfortunate set of coincidences but due a centralized power exerting control over the ecosystem. And that's just what's happened already.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:23:42
If it was an average sized transaction then my best guess is that you'll see it go through on ~Saturday with a $2.50 fee. The pool of waiting transactions balloons through the week and then gets partly emptied on the weekends.

It is an option, but also keep in mind that it locks your bitcoins up for some period of time - and generally it's just when you are in a hurry to spend or sell them that someone decides to borrow them for margin trading.
You can manage this by keeping the maximum duration at the minimum limit of 2 days, but 2 days can be an eternity in crypto. Once someone borrows your funds, you have no control over when you will get them back up to that maximum date limit you set.

Well, at the moment:
1. BitMixer, a popular tool for bitcoin anonymity, just went down permanently with an out of the blue announcement.
2. Technical analysis by a prominent Goldman Sachs analyst is predicting a sharp correction. 
3. BTC-e, a major exchange, is down and from all appearances it is for good - it was ID'd as a money laundering outfit yesterday and today a Russian who may be the head of it has been arrested.
4. BitcoinCash is forking with a highly compressed timeframe on August 1 that leaves exchanges and wallets no time to properly prepare, creating confusion and possible vulnerabilities for theft of BTC.
5. The SEC is basically saying ICO's are securities and making ominous noises. Although ETH is the leader in this area a lot of investing in ICO's is also done with BTC, and in any case this could chill the overall crypto market.
There is some minor good news but each of these alone would be enough to cause a significant dip. Taken together I'd say we'll see Bitcoin under $2K soon, maybe a lot lower for a short time. And if there is more bad news (such as other exchanges being fingered by the Feds, more aggressive actions from the SEC, BTC thefts related to BitcoinCash coming to fruition), then all bets are off.

There could be nasty problems with exchanges and wallets trying to cope with the short timing to prepare, but the idea is simple: Find everyone who owns bitcoin, and given them the same amount of a new coin.
Actually anyone can do this (fork off the Bitcoin blockchain); the trick lies in getting anyone to value such an effort. If someone walked up to me in the street and asked how much cash I had in my wallet, and then gave me the same amount in some made-up denomination they had just created, would I really be any wealthier?

Uh no. The issue is not that it is physically impossible to have created the keys. The issue was the method used to create the keys was a standard method at a later date in time (I think 2011 or thereabouts), but a completely different method was standard in 2008. So we can choose to believe:
1. That Wright oddly chose a unique method of key generation that just happened to become standard a few years later.
2. Or that Wright backdated his documents after creating them in a normal manner at a later date.

Except that it means we get to try activating segwit thru BIP148 on August 1 (likely resulting in a fork), and then we find out if Bitmain is bluffing about their Bitcoin ABC hardfork on August 4, and then we find out if the August 15 PoW change comes to fruition. So I think you're rather underestimating the consequences of SW2X not activating on their original schedule.

Years ago Bitcoin was the only meaningful crypto, serving the function of a store of value but not ready for other purposes. Fast forward to 2017 and that is still where things stand for Bitcoin, but there are now dozens of altcoins devoted to smart contracts, faster and more private use as currency, banking settlement and business-to-business transactions, storage applications, gaming, prediction markets and more.
Bitcoin maximalists who pretend the world will go back to revolving around Bitcoin are kidding themselves. Even if Bitcoin gets fixed - and there is still no light at the end of the tunnel on that - we can expect it to drop below 50% of the market soon, and I doubt it will ever see that mark again.

This is bad. Look at the wording - the 2 MB hardfork is automatic, but Segwit is dependent on a 80% threshold. So Jihan can block it and keep his covert ASICBoost indefinitely while still getting BU's 2 MB hard fork. 
This makes it a no-brainer for anyone who has learned to distrust Bitmain and their shenanigans, and for anyone who wants Segwit. No more empty promises. UASF BIP148.
Plus, there is the question of who is going to code the software, concerns over whether it will be stable and safe. Given BU's track record and the "rush job" attitude of the announcement I have a sick feeling on that point as well.

I would suggest trying Gemini. Coinbase is an option but a lot of people have trouble with them. Don't leave your coins on the exchange unless trading them.
Hardware wallets are good, if you don't mind paying for one. If you rely on a wallet on your computer  be sure to have backups in secure locations and don't do stupid things with that computer that could result in malware. Keep in mind you need to prevent theft/hacking, but also prevent loss due to flood/fire/tornado/etc. (I always recommend having a backup offsite from your home in a secure location).
If your investment is significant, I would agree with the suggestion to invest in a basket of cryptocurrencies. Check out Coinmarketcap.com and exchanges like Poloniex to start learning about them. They have much more upside potential than even bitcoin. 
Best wishes and welcome aboard!

In the philosophy of science there is a pretty sound rule that says that for something to be "science" it has to be testable. No fuzzy, ambiguous or retrodictive criteria.

It would give the scammers a harder time, and sticking to your guns could throw them off their game at critical points.

1. There is a fee to move bitcoin from one address to another. It is paid to miners not exchanges (though exchanges may charge their own fee I suppose). You can check out the fee situation at 
2. Yes, see above. There is less congestion on weekends so the fees can be a little lower then. 
3. In the event of a fork you will have the same amount of coins on both forks. More than that I can't say without knowing the particulars of the situation.
4. Definitely offline, with 2+ backups in secure locations. (Not all in 1 place such as your house in the event of a housefire/tornado/etc.)

Do we know he really has that supercomputer? There seems to be no hard evidence of it.
I was just reviewing some of the material from the December 2015 media frenzy. It seems to indicate Craig Wright was dropping hints and breadcrumbs about being Satoshi or his associate Dave Kleiman being Satoshi all over the place, such that the media was sure to pick up on one of them at some point. 
But my notion in the OP aside, I don't see what the motivation would be. And I can't quite take my own OP theory seriously. Wright is in for an exhausting and miserable time for the foreseeable future, between tax evasion investigations and media frenzies and a bipolar bitcoin community on his case.

BIP148 activates on August 1. In essence we will have a choice between bitcoin staying as it is now, or enabling Segwit which provides increased transaction capacity, fixes transaction malleability, and paves the way for massive scaling with Lightning networks.
The effort is known as a UASF, User Activated Soft Fork, because it does not rely on miners to succeed. In a nutshell if most bitcoin users prefer the Segwit version, miners will be forced to switch over and mine it, because otherwise they will be losing money mining unvalued coins on the other fork. 
The whole point is to let the free market decide whether to adopt SegWit or not, rather than letting any group of miners with 6% of hashpower or more to hold it up forever. (They are holding it up because lack of scaling creates transaction congestion, causing a major spike in the transaction fees they earn. Also because Segwit leads to Lightning Network off-chain transactions that they would earn no fees on.)
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:10:30
For the umpteenth time today... nothing is going to happen on August 1. SW is locking in within a few hours, so the UASF will not be needed.
EDIT: OK, I just read the Coinbase announcement. Boneheaded timing... I expect they will be retracting it tomorrow following SW lock-in in a few hours. Unless Jihan goes on a bender and declares he's still going to fork off despite SW2X activating per plan, but that should be a non-issue for Coinbase (and for everyone else, quite frankly.)

Alts soared two days ago, then crashed yesterday. Now they look mighty attractive again. 
My guess is that about any time now traders will look at the BTC gains, realize the risk of the inevitable pullback, and light a fire under the Alt prices again.

Anyone not using Bitmain hardware is not using covert ASICBoost. And there is no reason to believe miners with Bitmain hardware knew about and were using covert ASICBoost unless they were part of Jihan's inner circle.
Basically anyone who isn't using covert ASICBoost is at a severe disadvantage and would be much better off seeing it blocked.

You will have BitcoinCash but will need software to transact with it.

I don't have any solutions/advice at this point on how to trust any offered software.

@_date: 2017-07-01 04:59:33
I think I understand now, and have reconciled what you are saying with what Luke is saying. So the HF cannot activate unless SW activates, but SW can activate either from the SW2X effort or (if Bitmain blocks it) from the BIP148 effort.
So basically Bitmain can veto/block the SW activation on SW2X. But since they can't block BIP148, the latter will still trigger a countdown to HF on the BIP148 chain (regardless of what Bitmain is doing at that point). 
So Bitmain can then go fork off like they were threatening, and if their effort fails they have the solace of being able to come back to the BIP148 chain knowing they still get their hardfork despite having fought SW every step of the way. Clever of them.

Smaller blocks only cause higher fees if full (such as from the spam attack earlier this year). And larger blocks can be spammed as well, which may give a reason to have off-chain channels that cannot as easily be spammed (at least not with the same method) as an alternative.

So when will it be safe to send our BTC on to whatever we have planned (i.e., to a destination that may not be supporting the split). I was assuming that it would be safe to move BTC immediately after 12:20 UTC, any reason to think otherwise?
EDIT: I see from the link that the next six blocks after 12:20 will remain in common; but does that mean that the "snapshot" documenting who gets BCH is taken on the state of the blockchain at 12:20... or 6 blocks later? (6 blocks of BCH or BTC??? Because that makes a heck of a difference too.) I've been trying to keep up on this stuff and it's crazy that such a fundamental detail is hard to pin down.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:48:13
Yes (I should clarify that I am bullish on cryptocurrency, I am definitely NOT a Bitcoin maximalist); strategically Bitcoin as market leader is in a challenging situation: 
1. It has hundreds of competitors, and it only takes one to make a series of good decisions/executions to surpass Bitcoin.
2. But if Bitcoin makes rapid changes in an effort to stay ahead of all competition there is a high risk that one or more of the changes will blow up and severely damage the bitcoin brand/protocol/ecosystem.
So it needs to execute fairly swiftly, but with exceeding care on each change, and in a strategically intelligent manner. In its favor Bitcoin still has a major network effect advantage, the best devs in crypto and a large userbase that is committed to it. I wouldn't bet against it to easily.

Are you going to try to claim SW doesn't have dominant and widespread support? Or that it is dangerous? (We used to get that a lot, and still do by the boldest or most clueless trolls after it activated on LTC). 
Or do you have an alternate history of the Hong Kong agreement or Bitmain's reneging on agreements? Or alternative logic on why miners should be the selfless heroes (despite financial incentive to maximize fee revenue) while the development community (who gain nothing directly from the bitcoin ecosystem for their work) are villains? 
How about the patent infringement with ASICBoost? Are we really to believe the excuses about Antbleed? Do you have a reasonable explanation for Wrights rants and threats? Is there some way that his patent trolling could be good rather than awful for the cryptocurrency ecosystem? What about Wu and Ver's tweets discouraging people from running nodes so they can centralize their control?

Since they are hardly a traditional organization with a standard corporate structure (I assume), it would be easy to say he "wasn't an employee"  - instead perhaps more like an independent contractor.

Altcoins like Dash are moving towards cash replacement capability. One problem here is that cash-replacement coins will tend to have a high velocity, driving down the value of their coins. Whereas the current use case for Bitcoin is as a store of value (digital gold), where you want the exact opposite.
I haven't wanted to bring this up while the Segwit conflict was still ongoing, but insofar as there are a lot of businesses and investments into Bitcoin as a cash replacement, I think we may indeed need to have an amicable divorce someday. That is, a hardfork in which one fork is understood to be the store of value coin going forward, and the other is optimized for use as a cash replacement. I believe there are too many fundamental conflicts between the two visions (involving practically every parameter) to keep the two sides on one blockchain.

That's one irony to Bitcoin Cash. They manage to launch it right as it becomes clear, thanks to the end of the spam attacks, that 1 MB is still fine even without Segwit. 
They are throwing away all the benefits of Segwit for additional capacity that is completely unnecessary for Bitcoin, much less for a minor altcoin, so they can enjoy the network latency and blockchain bloat problems of the big block paradigm if and when they do get spammed. How do they manage to be this wrong? It amazes me.

Consider the financial niche of "digital gold" versus that of smart contracts. A crypto optimized as a store of value would value security and price stability, whereas transaction fees would be a much lower priority, as would slow confirmation times. On the contrary, those very characteristics of Bitcoin currently are directly related to the high level of security against 51% attacks and such that Bitcoin provides.
Now consider the DAO hack and its effect on the price of Ethereum. A coin optimized as a store of value (digital gold) would want to avoid such events at all costs - in other words, no smart contracts or other funky risks that could rock the price in a negative way.
I'm not saying there is anything that officially says bitcoin belongs in this particular niche. It may turn out otherwise. But it seems to me that ultimately we'll see the kind of diversification I'm hinting at here - that there will be coins that embrace smart contracts and those that very pointedly avoid them, coins that feature privacy and coins for transparency, coins meant to be fast and convenient and coins with high security such as time-locked vaults and even clawback protocols.

It doesn't work like that, or won't if we ever get some scaling. With Segwit and Lightning Network, etc., fees will be negligible again. Otherwise, yes, we will be priced out of bitcoin transfers, which will only be done by banking conglomerates and billionaires buying their latest megacorporation with it. The rest of us will be using Litecoin and Dogecoin (which is basically what I'm already doing for TX between exchanges.)

I think carderz refers to people using stolen credit cards. It's easy for people to imagine this, but Purse has been around a couple years now and is flourishing. It wouldn't if a significant number of people were running into any sort of legal trouble. Purse even offered to pay legal bills to anyone who had an issue a while back after one customer in Germany was raided by police, but that's the only case I've heard of that sort.
I had a problem with Amazon cancelling about a dozen gift cards I'd bought on Purse, without warning or explanation, in 2014. All from different bitcoin buyers. Amazon was completely uncooperative and uncommunicative and unhelpful despite my loud, repeated and public efforts to get them to restore my balance. In the end Purse made me a full refund. 
I won't say scammers aren't operating on Purse, but they are clearly the exception rather than the rule. In several dozen other transactions I've had no trouble, excepting the latest where the buyer tried shipping one item overseas rather than to my address, and then started sending me weird emails about it. But that got resolved by simply pro-rating the total based on the items I did receive, and so the only harm done was my first "negative" rating. I'm still pondering if I should appeal that one to the Purse admins, as I can't see that I did anything wrong and suspect the buyer was pulling some kind of scam.

Mining does not create value. They can do what you just said and it won't stop us dumping it to oblivion.  Besides, since Antbleed was exposed few miners are still vulnerable.

According to other reports/rumors the backup administrator(s) at BTC-e are in negotiations to bring the site back up with law enforcement authorities. I'm skeptical. I suspect that said law enforcement will want to vet customers/funds and freeze any they suspect are related to money laundering, in which case it may be a long and difficult path for customers to be able to withdraw their funds.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:42:24
That would thin out the ranks of the Core software developers a bit, as well as many of the leading bitcoin businesses, exchanges and wallets. And do you really want the Chinese becoming even more dominant?

A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Each block consists of transactions between bitcoin users. In essence it is a ledger, but the cryptography behind it prevents anyone from altering it and having it be accepted by anyone else.
Hardfork is a software change that is incompatible with the previous implementation. Softfork is a change that is backwards compatible. I think I have that right, but will welcome refinement/correction on the distinction.
Nodes gather bitcoin transactions from users around the world and pass them on to miners to be included in blocks.
UASF is a User Activated Soft Fork. A technique for making a change to bitcoin based on the bitcoin community driving the change, rather than miners controlling what code is used.

My thought is that Litecoin is the "drop-in replacement" to Bitcoin, if it comes to that point for the community (the Yours announcement and their thought process behind it is a case in point). Not sure what you had in mind. (Ethereum?)
Edit: Never mind - read my own post above! Yes, I think Ethereum has potential, and risks if it runs afoul of the weaknesses you mention. 
It is interesting that this morning I was reading through the investment materials for the ETC investment trust, and they point out that ETC has none of those weaknesses. They seem to have grasped exactly these issues and are trying to avoid them. I had thought of ETC as just a principled but oddball bunch of holdouts, but I've going to have to raise my assessment of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:37:58
This is the kind of backing we need. An economic majority _will_ carry the day with BIP148.
1. Users are not going to prefer the old chain with its lack of scaling once they have a clear choice upon August 1. Given a chance to finally have Segwit and the LN or get more of the same, they'll favor the SW chain.
2. That means even if miners hate it, they'll have a choice: mine an unprofitable chain or switch to the SW chain. The "worse" things are for the SW chain initially (in terms of lack of hashrate), the greater the incentive for the first miners to switch over, which will help alleviate the block time issue.
So the real key to this is patience at the point of implementation with regards to TX transfers. It will be worse on both chains to the extent the miners split between the chains. Be prepared by trying to pre-plan your BTC allocations and minimize any need to move BTC around immediately after BIP148 activates. And dump the  Jihancoins before the rest of us do. ;-)

It's conceivable one or more companies a core dev is employed by is engaging in some kind of private conspiracy. But you need some evidence for such a speculation to be worth anything. The protocol is open source as is the public debate. Fantasizing about sinister possibilities with no evidence and ignoring a great deal of accrued evidence that the opposing camp run by bad actors who have been, are, and plan to be abusing Bitcoin and its users for selfish ends is not reasonable.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:14:25
So what are the implications for the end of July? Can SW2X supporters get segwit activated without requiring miners to run this software at that point in time?
Because if getting SW activated prior to BIP148 requires trusting in and running this code... it ain't gonna happen. Enough miners will have sense or anxiety enough to not use it to drop below the 80% threshold. In which case it's up to BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-09 21:44:02
Why would someone want to buy a large amount of bitcoin on the eve of a potential collapse in the price? This looks like a belated attempt by a whale to prop up the market while they unload their coins.

I'm just making up the $2000 and $200 numbers, so don't put any stock in them. My basic point was that the version with scaling should be valued a great deal more than the version without scaling. ETH and ETC have had about a 10:1 ratio at times and that's the nearest analogy so I went with that.
The mining pool was just announced yesterday, so yeah, I expect it won't amount to much soon, and maybe not ever. We'll see.

LOL. Talk an altcoin into allowing multi-megabyte blocks and then arrange to have them filled (with spam TX or whatever) as a demonstration. Watch the price tank as anyone with a node asks why put up with the increased demands on their system when better alternatives are available and they bail out. 
I've chatted with enough "regular folks" using altcoin full wallets and nodes the last few months to know that blockchain and block size are becoming a real issue for them. The "Big Block" folks seem oblivious to this - maybe it's not an issue for enterprise-class data centers and high end equipment, but I'm seeing increasing evidence of crypto users being pushed into relying on exchanges, or at least lightweight clients, to hold their coins.

True both for this and the PSA. There's a wholesale lack of good information available so far in crypto media and blogs and so forth because this is all so new and things are changing so fast. Here we are less than a week out and the Bitcoincash (we should avoid using "BCC" after the confusion already demonstrated with it) website doesn't have a working wallet to offer, and no assurance even that will not be malware.

Thanks for bringing a smile to some of us... I spent over $4K building an altcoin mining rig at the start of 2014. Even that isn't economical any more. Today bitcoin mining is an industrial scale enterprise - you need a reliable source of free or extremely cheap electricity, all-year cold temperatures (think Iceland, Siberia or the Himalayas), and a budget large enough to reach economies of scale.
In other words, you're a bit like an earnest fellow showing up with a pickaxe and a shovel wondering where the gold rush is, after it has transitioned to strip-mining with heavy industrial equipment. ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:52:38
Why would miners adopt a change that reduces congestion and as a result dramatically reduces the fees they are earning? Not to ignore ASICBoost, but for the mining community as a whole that is the problem. Until everyone starts using Litecoin or Dogecoin or something to move funds around they have no competition and thus no incentive to adopt Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:42:16
Well, we have the Bearwhale for one. And Silbert wants Segwit. Judging by the tweeting he will probably realize by August that supporting BIP148 is the only way to get it. I bet there are many more like him out there. They may not publicly support a grassroots effort like the UASF, but when the time comes and they have to choose.... they are not going to consign Bitcoin to further stagnation. (Unless they decide to short it and load up on alts?)

Imagine if BCH has 1% hash power. And now imagine one of the mining pools that has been annoyed with Jihan's antics decides to dedicate 1.1% hashpower to mining the BCH fork, but cuts their connections so they are mining a private chain.
The fork occurs and for the first couple days everything looks OK; blocks are slow but things start to pick up and it looks like a viable coin. Then the secret chain, with more proof-of-work and a bunch of empty blocks is released. The "public" chain instantly ceases to exist and all the transactions with it. Chaos ensues. The coin will be for all intents dead at that point as no one will trust it.
If they really only have a small hashrate, I don't know if having _any_ number of confirmations is going to work to protect against such a possibility.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:20:39

@_date: 2017-07-05 13:47:36
It seems to me that it would be easy to require bitcoin buyers on ebay to post their public key within EBay's message system that they want the bitcoin sent to. Then when the scammers run to Ebay/Paypal, the latter should be able to look up the message (that you can direct them to) with the recipient's public key. Then you just share the TX ID proving you sent the bitcoin, and sign a message proving you control the sending address.
This isn't rocket science. Well, maybe it is, but it's downright simple and Paypal should get a clue.

I'd have no problem with Bitmain if they were merely trying to make a buck in a competitive free market environment.

If by getting into mining you mean some cloud mining scam, just don't. It's a pure waste of money. Just buy your bitcoins on an exchange like any sane person.
Things may be volatile, but I expect the impact of August 1 will be short-lived. Just do dollar-cost averaging and start buying in based on a budgeted amount without trying to time the market. If you try to time your trades, guess at dips and so on, understand you're swimming with sharks and there are few rules in the wild west of cryptocurrency markets (and manipulation thereof). (Apologies for the mixed metaphors...)

Well, do you like paying $2 fees on every TX and having your transactions get stuck for days on end if you go a little short on the fee? 
A lot of us remember when fees were a few cents and never got stuck. There's no reason we can't have that again.
That's the difference.

Well, first you buy the wallet ;-)
The hardware wallet (or any other wallet out there) will provide you with a public key (string of text/numbers). You just go to your Coinbase account, choose Send Bitcoin, and paste the public key into the address field along with the amount you are sending. Coinbase then posts the transaction to the Bitcoin network, where miners include the transaction in a block and add it to the blockchain. Once this is done the blockchain ledger shows those bitcoin(s) are held by your wallet, and your wallet will show the same once it sees the transaction on the blockchain.

The 12-word seed is used to generate the private key when your wallet is set up, it is not the key itself.

Fairness has nothing to do with it. It's a technical limitation. Dogecoin would be a better choice for the lemonade stand in your example. 
Eventually if we can get Segwit implemented and Lightning Network and other off-chain solutions working you will see fees plummet. That's why (at least partly) miners have been working so hard to stall SW implementation.

BitcoinCash is down to .135 BTC on ViaBTC, so he could get over 14,000 BitcoinCash for 2000 BTC now. By the time August 1 rolls around they'll be pretty worthless. But the damage (albeit temporary) will have been done - especially if it's all a scam to steal BTC using malware "splitting" tools. They only need to prop the price up enough for people to think it's worth the bother of dumping their Bitcoincash for the malware angle to work.

Oh, I'll certainly be dumping it, if I can figure out how to do it safely (not a trivial concern). 
You're right that all competition affects BTC price. But this is a targeted attack and is affecting BTC users directly (as in the example I gave) who didn't intend to put their BTC at risk. That's what is galling.

No single exchange handles everything, nor would you want them to. There are around 800+ viable cryptocurrencies at the moment so it's kind of overwhelming. Poloniex has the largest volumes in trading but is fairly selective in limiting how many altcoins they support, Bittrex has a larger number but they don't fully overlap. Cryptopia and NovaExchange seem to have large numbers of coins including many that have low value and low volumes. Other exchanges I've used have disappeared either from exit scams or hacking. There are quite a few others out there as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:38:02
Except this time around the market is refusing to react, by and large. (BTC is actually up .81% over 24 hours in USD as I write). As if the market is cocking its head and glaring at the miners "who do you think you are kidding? Get on with it."

Actually we are going to need enough hashpower or block times will skyrocket and disaster will ensue. I'm very pro-BIP148 and see this as the critical weak point in the plan right now. I wonder how  much hashpower is available for rental? We don't need 51%, but we need enough to muddle along until the difficulty adjusts or we are close enough to 51% to scare miners on the fence into joining it out of concern that mining the other fork will be a waste of time (since it evaporates once it is outrun). Hopefully heads better than mine are wargaming this and have some solutions.

Lukejr expressed support for a POW change the other day, and I've been serious for a while (not that I am anybody special) in saying it needs to happen. I believe ASIC-based mining has already gone well past the decentralization threshold at which we should be alarmed, and the fact that we're already reacting to shocks like Antbleed and ASICBoost makes me wonder how long we can dodge these bullets. 
I'd like to see a roadmap with a POW change far enough out that miners can plan accordingly and ROI with current gear, but eventually get back to CPU-based mining and a firm policy that this will be maintained by future POW changes if necessary. 
I know it's a huge mess and will seem scary - but not changing and leaving things as they are simply scares me worse.

On the one hand we do want to be empathetic. But it also serves as a warning to others - you really are playing with fire in the long run keeping your funds on exchanges and not under your control. To some extent it's unavoidable until decentralized exchanges become more widespread, but it needs to be kept firmly in mind.

What about ASICBoost, Antbleed, months of FUD over Segwit and holding it hostage? And now a rashly timed and implemented hardfork. There is no equivalence from Core, which has actually helped them several times with their miserable coding. They've earned the hostility far more than anything in reverse. 
I wish I could see something good in their efforts because it would enable me to describe their work in terms that don't make me sound like an extremist. But I literally cannot. There is just no sane, ethical case for what they have been doing and are trying to do. So if I sound extreme, it's only because I find them to be extreme.

Let me ask both sides: what is the evidence for and against Jihan controlling or exerting strong influence over each of the named pools?
Hayo - what would you suggest as a threshhold at which we should be concerned? I think it is mistake to wait until someone has already won at 51% - we need to be very, very concerned well before that point. Heck, there should be no _dozen_ people who can collude with 51% of the hashrate, much less one person. IMO.

The problem is with theft of BCC, not BTC (unless I'm missing something). Legacy holders of BTC should be receiving their corresponding BCC and it should be under their control. As it appeared yesterday (and if not resolved by the action Peter Todd notes above), dishonest miners and other scammers will be able to steal the BCC assigned to legacy BTC holders on a widespread scale after the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:02:53
Why would it retain any value? What does it do better than a horde of other altcoins? 8 MB blocks on an underutilized chain without offchain scaling via SW is a meaningless gesture.
5% would give it a market cap just under Litecoin. There are already a bunch of coins named "Bitcoin____". None of them are worth more than a drop in the bucket compared to Litecoin, much less Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:02:04
Miners will go out of business supporting a coin that is designed to maximize miner profits at the expense of users. We can reasonably expect the BIP148 coin to maintain value much better than one under Bitmain's control or influence.
So miners will have a choice - they can mine a coin whose value is plummeting or the one retaining value. If there are few miners on the BIP148 chain that just increases the potential profits for miners who make the switch, particularly once difficulty adjusts. Assuming miners are ultimately acting for profit, the hashrate on the BIP148 chain will eventually be proportional to any other forks based on relative value of each coin - with the caveat that once BIP148 proves viable the wipeout risk will grow as hashrate shifts until the legacy chain is too risky to mine.

I haven't seen any futures markets yet. I suspect the situation is so fluid and there are so many possibilities that anyone who has seriously  sat down at an exchange and tried to figure out how to structure one has failed.
Edit: I've pulled out to litecoin for the month. I thought things looked pretty good a few days ago, but it seems like the straightforward path is coming unglued and I think we are in for a rocky month. My logic:
1. If BTC does well, the alts tend to do better. So I should be fine in LTC.
2. If BTC craters or there is uncertainly and BIP148 activates without consensus people will be fleeing in 3 main directions: Back to fiat, into Ethereum, and into Litecoin. The latter will get the biggest bump as it has the smalled market cap relative to funds that may be pointed at it, and it is the clearest alternative to BTC if BTC remains crippled or subject to the Bitmain coup.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:45:46

@_date: 2017-05-30 14:08:02
Watch for Litecoin to gain at BTC's expense. I know people tend to focus on Ethereum, but ultimately the latter is too different in structure, governance, usages and orientation from Bitcoin. Whereas litecoin is more of a "drop-in replacement" to Bitcoin as the latter stagnates.
(Don't get me wrong, I hold comparable amounts of both Ethereum and LTC in addition to BTC. But with SW and the LN already on Litecoin, it is becoming or has become what Bitcoin ought to be.)

@_date: 2017-07-11 13:54:06
August 1 is for BIP148, which is completely separate from Segwit2X. I'd say this increases the chances that SW will not be activated prior to August 1 via the SW2X roadmap, and therefore it is more likely that BIP148 will be activated (and the Bitmain will retaliate on August 4 as threatened).

Yikes....I assume you got that bitcoin from faucets? That's your problem right there. 
Your problem is that having many inputs means the outbound transaction has to reference ALL the inputs, making the TX very large. You pay by the byte (not by transaction amount), so having a large TX that takes up a lot of space on the blockchain gets expensive.
You shouldn't have had to pay such a large fee right now, but up until recently there was a major spam attack causing a lot of congestion and forcing fees to go very high. A lot of wallets and fee estimation sites are doing a bad job of reacting to the fact that the spam has stopped and fees SHOULD be much lower again - so basically because you didn't know any better you ended up badly overpaying (though with the size of the TX it would have been kinda expensive regardless). 
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:41:24
The key is what happens with SW2X's attempt to activate SW in less than 2 weeks. If it does, BIP148 is a non-issue and the next point of contention will be over the 2nd part of the SW2X program, but that won't hit hammer time for a couple months.
If SW2X fails to activate SW it will be for one of 2 reasons:
1. Their software blows up.
2. A major mining pool or pools yanks their support (surprise!)
1 may not be a big deal; if the SW support is sincere among the miners supporting SW2X they can just back SW via BIP148 on August 1 while waiting for SW2X development to get its act together. 
2 is the big deal. It will mean the anti-SW opposition is going to force the issue, and it will get ugly. If that's the case, yes, batten down the hatches and prepare for some wild volatility.

Whether by PoW changes to ASIC-resistant algorithms or something else, the power of miners to essentially dictate terms to all bitcoin users must be broken. 
It's as if all the Walmart cashiers got together and decided to start imposing a $5 surcharge on everyone coming through their checkout.

You see, after 16+ years of brainwashing in the secular humanist fundamentalism of the government indoctrination camps, I ran across "heretical" literature (of the sort entirely censored in my schools) that led me to deprogram myself and adopt a much more empirical and reasonable worldview.

They could make a reasonable guess, and say they plan to support it if it is above "X" level of support (subject to change). Or they could at least reassure people that they will be able to obtain their BCC and send them offsite after the split.

Very good point; when I invested into GBTC it was with less than 1% of my total portfolio.
Despite the potential for high profits in crypto I would counsel investors to first use traditional and more conservative investment options, up to the point where their retirement (and other) goals are fully funded. Then anything beyond that point can be invested in more speculative high risk/reward options like cryptocurrency. That's basically been my approach in fact.
It's just too risky to assume the future is as rosy as the past 8 years, particularly since one cryptocurrency can supplant another. If investments were plotted on an old map in terms of risk/reward, out on the margin of the map would be Bitcoin (and altcoins beyond it), along with the notation "Here be monsters." And their treasure.

He's been shilling 24/7 for BU on Bitcointalk for months, trying his best to shut down any progress on scaling. Thus my assumption is that he's a miner himself or paid by them, to keep the fee market as congested as possible short of killing off bitcoin.
Big blocks won't allow serious scaling to occur like off-chain solutions, but off-chain solutions mean the miners will actually have competition from other TX handlers. Thus they "favor" big blocks, but drag their feet about actually implementing such a solution (i.e., the BU model) because it would resolve the fee market situation for a short time.

Bitcoin value is dropping now in anticipation of the split, since some people think some of the value will go to BCC. This will be short-lived (assuming the software for BCC does not crash and burn right at the fork, which I give 50/50 odds on), but in the meantime the price of BTC may be impaired from this siphoning effect.

Bugs and reorgs should only be hitting BCH. What I'm concerned about is trying to rush my BTC back to my favored exchanges to execute a plan I have in mind.

No, I would never agree to changing the money supply of bitcoin. Period.
Bitcoin is more a store of value at this point than a currency. I have always been firm in my belief that there will be many successful cryptocurrencies in the future occupying all manner of financial niches. Coins like Dash or Litecoin are more likely to take on the role of digital cash. If modest inflation is recognized as desirable by the general community than it will migrate to a PoS coin with a permanent inflation rate in some form.

Hogwash. BIP148 was created prior to SW2X and is in no way reliant on it. 
Miners can say they don't support it all they want... until August 1 and the legacy coin price plummets. Then they can enjoy mining a worthless coin, or actually mine the coin that retains value. 
You may enjoy the thought of sticking with a legacy coin that offers no scaling. We'll go with the scaled coin that has Segwit and is ready for LN and other offchain solutions to keep fees low and Bitcoin growing.
Miners can stick their heads in the sand all they want. Come August 1 they either choose to remain in business serving customers or go out of business serving themselves.

BCC launch is being designed as a well-coordinated attack on BTC. Not only will there be a flood of FUD from the usual suspects, scammers may be having a field day advertising new wallets to supposedly let you split your BitcoinCash out - but stealing your BTC instead.

I doubt it. When a coin splits it doesn't magically create wealth. All else being equal the market assigns a portion of the value of the original coin to each of the new coins. So you will see Bitcoin drop (I mean in addition to the pre-August 1 crashing) if BitcoinCash achieves/maintains any value. 
Otherwise, if every time a split like this occurred it was a free dividend, well by all means let's do a fork every day! Obviously it doesn't work like that.

I still think they are just burning bridges. Bitcoin already has a huge mining centralization problem - we wouldn't even be having these conflicts if it were not for this - and the latency problems associated with larger blocks just aggravate that problem. Which means it is all the more important to prevent larger blocks.

Unfortunately Jihan doesn't just vanish into a puddle or a puff of smoke if BIP148 is successful. He still has control of Bitmain ASIC manufacturing, still is a dominant miner, still has his ambitions. What can or needs to be done regarding the latter is still very far from answered IMO. 
I know people are talking about a POW change and I'm in favor of it in principle, but I also warn that it is not a panacea either, and carries a number of risks that need to be carefully considered in any implementation plan.

Apparently he gave Charlie $5K at some point in the past when he needed it. Probably without any paperwork spelling out whether it was gift or loan or any terms to go with it. So there was almost certainly some abiguity about it. Roger never asked for the money back and Charlie never repaid it. 
So then yesterday Roger decided to use it in what amounts to an extortion attempt via Twitter, demanding Charlie not criticize him since had accepted money from him. Charlie responded by offering to pay the money back pronto.

You are right that they are playing by the rules, so to speak. But that doesn't mean we cannot describe a minority effort to block improvements in negative terms. They are holding bitcoin hostage by preventing Segwit (and thus the Lightning Network in its best form) from activating, thus blocking the scaling path preferred by the large majority of users. 
Whether it is an irrational fear of Segwit or covert use of ASICBoost or a desire to pump alts or something else, they've succeeded in blocking bitcoin's progress for a long while now.

I'd only sell to fiat (or tether actually) if I thought I could buy back in lower. And I know I'm a lousy market timer so I don't do that.
The only thing worth selling BTC for is alts, until scaling is fixed, unless you need to put food on the table.

Could be the holdout pools are manipulating this for profit, as they know the market will dive/soar based on what they do right now. 
There is also the possibility that the issue nullc raised is causing them to hold off until resolved, but I would discount that. It hasn't led to any other pools pulling their support, so I see no reason why it would legitimately cause the holdouts to delay their support.

First, it is not "BCC". That is Bitconnect, a completely unrelated coin.
BitcoinCash is going to be based on a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. So anyone with private keys controlling an address with Bitcoin will also have control of the same amount of BitcoinCash on their forked/cloned blockchain on August 1. But you will need a wallet capable of safely splitting out the coins. 
If you have your BTC on Electrum you will have BitcoinCash as well. The trick is being able to transact it safely. (PSA:

Gold is valuable today without anyone using it for payments (pretty much). Again,  you are defining things too narrowly if the only thing that matters to you in the world is that something can be used as cash and everything else is a "failure."
Bitcoin scarcity is maintained by the simple fact that the users/market would have to agree to dilute their own coins in order to increase the supply. In what realistic scenario would that _ever_ happen? (Besides rounding up millions of people in concentration camps to force their vote against their own self-interest, which is about what it would take).  
This is why there has not been the slightest serious hint of a change in the block reward in 8+ years, compared to frequent and regular dilution of fiat currencies. If you want to see failure (from the perspective of users) - there it is, in the perpetually disintegrating value of government-issued fiat.

Welcome to the current state of Bitcoin, though something odd is going on to get that high a fee.
The fee is a function of the bitcoin mining process, it has nothing to do with Blockchain.info. They don't get any of it. Fees are spiking way up due to the success of Bitcoin creating a backlog of transactions until a scalability solution is implemented. (That's a huge topic in itself, just start reading here in this subreddit.)
Anyway... .059 is still a huge fee. Only way for that to happen is if someone sent a huge amount of dust (that is, your funds are made up of dozens of little transactions all bundled together). If so that was pretty lame on the part of the LBC seller to not warn you, and I would strongly avoid them in the future. You can see the current state of transactions at 
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:39:05
Mostly, but there are exceptions. You can buy some major cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin on exchanges like Coinbase. (They also handle Ethereum and Litecoin). In general though most currencies are handled on exchanges like Poloniex and Bittrex that don't directly handle fiat currencies.

Larger blocks increase latency (longer time to transmit the blocks), which makes it harder for marginal miners or miners who are not well-connected to compete. This increases mining centralization and the power of the dominant miners.
On a secondary level, larger blocks also reduce the need to move transactions to off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network. This keeps all the transaction fees in miners pockets rather than allowing competition from off-chain payment channels.

I'm no expert, but the sender has to sign their transaction proving that they own the bitcoins being sent. This enables the blockchain to accept their TX and deposit the bitcoins specified in the transaction with the new public key/address.
3rd parties cannot spoof that address because the digital signature is a hash of the private key used to prove ownership of the coins, along with the destination address (key) and amount (and maybe other things). Change one digit and the signature changes completely, so a hacker cannot redirect or steal funds from the sender. 
The receiver can use the received bitcoins by signing a transaction proving their ownership/control of the public key receiving the bitcoins from the prior transaction. They can only do this is they control the private key from which the public key is derived.
Hopefully I've got that basically right - someone correct me if I muffed any of it...

Companies that provide crappy customer service don't survive long. Even if they start by being the dominant company in their niche, the bad service drives people away until it is too late. This is PRECISELY what you are doing to Bitcoin.
I can get much faster confirmation times with much lower fees with dogecoin, litecoin, or just about anything else. Sneering that I have to use Bitcoin because everyone uses Bitcoin just motivates me to find ways around your obnoxious service. 
One of these days someone like Bittrex or Poloniex will announce Litecoin basemarkets for all their coins, allowing traders to skip the  hassle of dealing with BTC altogether. With LTC on Coinbase and other fiat gateways the BTC pipeline to the alts will deflate and Bitcoin maximalists will wonder what happened as the price goes into a terminal tailspin and miners are bankrupted.

No sane person would want to invest in BCC "over" BTC but you may want to dump it if you can find a safe way to do so.
BCC means one of three things:
1. Bitconnect - apparently an established altcoin that has original rights to "BCC".
2. "Bitcoin Core" BCC Token on Bitfinex - as opposed to Bitcoin Unlimited's proposed hardfork.
3. Bitcoin Cash - hardfork a splinter group of big block malcontents is launching August 1.
The last is what is causing all the fuss and confusion today.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:20:07
If they were just splitting off amicably it would be fine. (Frankly I'd be delirious with delight). But my opinion is that they are not doing so with the thought of leaving Bitcoin alone, but have constructed BitcoinCash as an active attack on the Bitcoin ecosystem:
1. There's no sane reason for an incredibly compressed timeframe, with no time for proper coding of any changes (such as upgraded replay protection) and testing, and no time for exchanges to react and prepare and communicate their plans to customers. A sincere big-block effort would not go out of its way to cause such chaos, and there's no reason for such urgency.
2. This may be an effort to steal BTC by offering malware that claims to split out BitcoinCash from BTC owner's funds, instead sending their private keys to scammers. 
3. If the software doesn't crash and burn at the point of the fork, and  does not come to fruition, we have the prospect of a splinter group claiming itself as the true inheritors of Satoshi's vision (LOL) and forever attacking Bitcoin and trying to supplant it and destroy it. Granted, other coins compete with Bitcoin, but in this case it will be much more aggressive and negative, hurting Bitcoins image continuously in the public as they pursue their agenda.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:04:59
LOL... sure. But they won't need 1 MB much less 8 since they are only a small fraction of Bitcoin users and their coin is stunted (bringing back transaction malleability, crippling off-chain scaling). That makes their move to 8 MB doubly ironic, and ill-conceived if their real intent was anything other than an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:08:55
Sounds (from the last paragraph) like they are confident they have a handle on the replay attack issue and that they can prevent losses from it. Going so far as to advise newbies to send them their funds to avoid BTC/Bitcoincash losses from the August 1 hardfork. As they say there will be "chaos". 
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:45:56
Your question is poorly worded - you mean to be asking if bitcoin is an alternative to stocks/mutual funds/bonds etc. in IRA's and 401K's, since in principle you can hold bitcoin within an IRA or 401K.
I'm not aware of any 401K plans yet that offer Bitcoin, but I've held GBTC (which is basically a Bitcoin vehicle) in an IRA. And self-directed IRA plans exist which allow you to invest directly into Bitcoin with your IRA funds.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:07:22
I've used Tether, but I suggest Litecoin as a better alternative.
1. Alts tend to rise more when Bitcoin rises, so LTC should gain if  you're wrong.
2. A lot of people are going to be pulling out of Bitcoin in the next few weeks. That money will flow 3 ways: (A) To fiat (or tether), which will be mostly stable but with almost no upside, (B) to Ether, which is volatile and may crash at some point, and (C) to Litecoin, which with Segwit and LN work in progress is what Bitcoin should and could be.
The latter is the smallest market cap so it will do the best as a result of these inflows. And if BTC does get taken over by Bitmain or is otherwise crippled, the remainder of folks using Bitcoin will mostly choose to (pardon the pun) man the liteboats and adopt LTC as their own. At least, that's my prediction/belief.

Nicehash is where you lease other people's mining rigs. They don't physically bring you their miner, you just direct what coin you want to mine and your address to receive earnings. 
Now, if you want to build your own mining rig and mine yourself (or lease it out on Nicehash), that's what would make sense if you have a fair amount of free time and enjoy technical minutae. It's a great way to get in neck deep learning about cryptocurrency in detail. That's how I started out (and leased my rig on Nicehash in the latter stages of my mining.)

The No-SW faction is merely (1) clueless or (2) miners using covert ASICboost. Bigger blocks are helpful only for scaling - but will not be needed on an altcoin like BCC, and aren't needed on Bitcoin since the spam attacks ended, much less with the scaling provided by SW and then LN, sidechains, etc. Bigger blocks will also encourage blockchain bloat, spam, latency issues leading to orphaning, etc. So it gives nothing positive in a real-world sense to an altcoin, only negatives.
So, no, I don't see any reason whatever to assign any value to BCC. Unless someone thinks supporting a miner using covert ASICBoost is somehow worthwhile.

If the next payout is middle of the month, then yes, that's  your next payout.
As you'll discover, it's cheaper to buy bitcoin on an exchange than rent someone's mining equipment. (I say this as a former miner who leased out his rig on Nicehash.) After all, why would the miner lease his rig to you unless you are paying him more than he can earn mining himself?

I haven't done a 0-fee TX this year, but from what I saw on  it looked plausible. (Please note that they keep listing a recommended fee that is way too high, unless you really are in a big hurry and can't afford any delay). 
Note that even here in the middle of the week there is a big bulge of confirmed transactions in the 21-40 sat/byte range. That's sufficient if not in a big rush.
Worst case if fees spike up is your TX just languishes and you wait about a week for it to fall out of the mempool. Then you can try again with a fresh TX.

I will be glad to see a fork, though I don't see it being permanent.

Trading is done on exchanges, with little or no need for TX over the short run. (Heck, Ethereum has been locked down on Polo since June 22 and they are still trading it just fine). So I think you are going to be surprised if BIP148 activates and you imagine only miners and businesses count. It is buyers of bitcoin who count, because they will set the price on each fork and miners will be dragged willingly or no to serve the winning fork.

Bitcoincash (not "BCC" that is Bitconnect) was disavowed by Jihan's Bitmain. It's some splinter group effort, I've seen nothing identifying who is actually leading it at this point, which is suspicious in itself.
They said they are doing it regardless of the SW activation. There's no sign of them standing down and I doubt the futures market on ViaBTC would have started if there was any plan to not fork it.

Old timers will tell you never leave your coins on an exchange. Many early exchanges were hacked or the owners fell to temptation at some point and ran off with their coins. 
I don't think the latter applies to Coinbase, but you have to judge whether you can do a better job of securing your funds than Coinbase. There is also the issue of them hassling customers or locking down funds for some reason - it does happen. Your coins are not ultimately under your control with them.
That said, if you take control of the coins yourself you need to beware two risks: Risk of theft and Risk of Loss. 
Risk of theft. 
This does not just include hacking, which is what everyone focuses on. You can print your wallet in hardcopy using an offline computer, etc., but then thieves can physically walk off with it. So you need to have a secure place to store your BTC whether in physical or digital form, with secure, long passwords and encryption.
If using a computer to store funds, don't visit sketchy websites, especially "too-good-to-be-true" bitcoin-related advertising. That's a good way to get hacked.
Risk of loss. 
It does you no good to have a super-secure computer with a great password if you then lose the password or your computer crashes and you have no backup. Across a human lifespan such events, not to mention things like a flood or house fire, are downright likely. So plan your bitcoin storage with that in mind.
Have backups of your wallet in several safe locations, and have your password/seed backed up in other safe locations. You can "hide" them by putting them in encrypted files (like a ZIP file with a simple, easily remembered password), and then giving them a name like "Vacation Pics 2009". No random thief/hacker will waste time going through stuff like that. So you can use cloud storage with techniques like that, in case your physical home location is destroyed by a tornado or something. A safe deposit box is also a good storage location, using media designed to last a long time. 
Also keep in mind that you may die suddenly - do you have loved ones you'd like to be able to inherit your bitcoin? If so let them know how they can gain access to your wallet, without putting your bitcoin at risk while you live. In my case I gave a password-protected file with instructions to one relative, while another relative who lives elsewhere has the password to access the file. A multi-sig wallet setup is also a good idea for cases like this.
Hope this helps - and welcome aboard!!

I guess this is one good side effect of the political debating. People are incentivized to support their viewpoint by running a node signaling their preferences.

Officially 12:20 UTC on August 1. I'm not sure how that plays out if they take a long time to actually mine a BCH block though. The fork can exist at 12:20, and I suppose exchanges can credit accounts and start trading, but it may quite a few hours before the first block is mined if the hashrate is low.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:02:49
You can't lose your bitcoin if you are not transacting. If replay protection is done properly by BitcoinCash (which seems iffy given the timeframe) then you should be safe transacting after the fork, but you may want to await further news both on the subject of replay protection and Electrum's own announcements relating to BitcoinCash.

I'm guessing they will scrape together 5-10% of the Bitcoin network hashrate. At that level they get a block every 100-200 minutes until things start adjusting after close to 12 hours in 20% increments. It will be a slow start.
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:05:43
I'm sorry to hear that. If you have no real need for it then I'd say do as others have suggested and dollar-cost average it into bitcoin or bitcoin and a couple other cryptocurrencies. Might want to wait to see what happens with segwit though.

Right... though I am concerned that opportunists will rush out a bunch of malware promoted as "tools" or "wallets" to split out BCC from BTC. And then a horde of unsuspecting mainstream Bitcoiners will happily load their private keys into the malware to get their "free" BCC... and you can guess how that will end. This could get ugly even if the BCC hardfork doesn't crash right off the bat (which wouldn't surprise me.)

I dunno, it looks like there's the possibility he will drag down Bitmain and Roger Ver if we give him enough rope and let things play out.

Hopefully the former wake up and realize the folly of trusting in Wu/Ver/Wright at this point.

It BTC fails because of a change it will make the most sense to go back to the cause of failure, correct it and restart (whatever that entails). BCH (not BCC - Bitconnectcoin) will have nothing to do with that.

Most altcoins are bought and sold with bitcoin, not directly to fiat. So, all else being equal, one would expect that an increase in bitcoin's value as measured in fiat ($, euro, yen, etc.) would yield an equivalent increase on average amongst the alts.
What I've noticed is more common is that there seems to be a magnification of this effect among alts. When bitcoin goes up, the alt market goes up more. And when bitcoin goes down, the alt market tanks even more. Of course there are exceptions but it seems to be the general trend, and I don't pretend to have it figured out yet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:06:57
This is looking more and more like a thinly disguised scamcoin.

2. BitConnectCoin is an established coin ( on Coinmarketcap) with the rights to BCC.

1. If bitcoincash does somehow maintain a price about 1/5 of BTC, it will siphon off that much value from Bitcoin. It's not a "free dividend" as some assume. 
2. If bitcoincash crashes from software bugs or other problems, it can create a fair amount of mayhem from BTC being locked on many exchanges, attempts to split going haywire, or even BCC and/or BTC being stolen from vulnerabilities, hackers offering malware "splitting tools" and so forth. 
BTC might navigate a path between these two possibilities, but the odds for continued decline right up through the fork are much higher IMHO.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:54:11
That's hopeful, but I'm not keen to entrust my private keys to some suddenly-appearing wallet claiming to offer BCC support in the next few days. Scammers are going to be having a field day with this, and that will entail loss of BTC as well as BCC funds. I hope there are some robust and well-publicized solutions to this mess in the next few days, because right now this looks like a very effective attack on Bitcoin that could do a lot of damage if scammers take advantage of the confusion.

They won't be stuck. The risk is that after the fork if you move your Bitcoin without the proper precautions, it could make the Bitcoincash that you rightfully hold on the cloned chain vulnerable to theft (and vice versa). 
And I wish I had solid advice about what to do to prevent that, but wallet providers have terribly little time to react so solutions are either going to be haphazard or delayed. It's likely that before well-vetted and tested solutions are available, there will first be a bunch of malware releases by scammers preying upon people trying to move their bitcoin and desperate for tools to "safely" do so.

Fast forward to 2016. NEM showed up on the Top 100 list on Coinmarketcap. Those 10,000 NEM were worth $10. Rats. After thinking it through, I went ahead and bought my 10,000 NEM back. Now it's worth $2,647.95...

You just have to keep trying... the backlog for using it only clears when Via wins a block, so my suggestion is to watch who is getting blocks at Coin.Dance/blocks - when you see Via just got one, that may mean their backlog has cleared and you can submit your TX for the next one they win.

BCC is BitConnectCoin
BCH is Bitcoin Cash, as noted on Bitfinex, NovaExchange and other exchanges and that seems to be the accepted designation now, a host of clueless redditors notwithstanding.

A week ago on bitcointalk I guessed:
60% to activate SW with SW2X
35% to activate SW with BIP148
5% no SW upgrade
I didn't consider the hardfork options.  Today I would say:
50% to get SW with SW2X
45% to get SW with BIP148
5% SW is blocked
This is just my swag of course.
I'm not too concerned about a split unless they both maintained strong support such that the minority coin holds &gt;25% of the market value of the majority coin. If one proves viable but at a smaller level it will be similar to the ETH/ETC split that hasn't done much to hurt Ethereum. 
And I don't see any minority forks surviving with the various Bitcoin split options because unlike the ETC faction having some good principles (immutability, freedom from "benevolent dictatorship" governance and a capped coin supply), the Bitmain/SW2X hardfork plans offer users no reason to adopt them.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:40:29
I tend to agree with this. It dramatically increases the vulnerabilities for cryptocurrencies with smart contract capability.
Personally, I'd like to see a firewall between smart contracts and "store of value" cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I know some people are excited by Rootstock, but I think Bitcoin will be better off if it never has direct vulnerability to a smart contract blowing up.

Very good, especially remembering the charity. In my case I've very modest personal wants (I can never come  up with a decent birthday list for example), and have traditional investments I expect are more than sufficient for my families' needs (nothing momentous, just I've always been a saver). So my hope and plan and expectation is that my crypto stash be 100% for charity. 
In May I pulled out an amount equal to $1000 more than the total I invested into cryptocurrencies for a first round of charity. That way even if it all goes bust tomorrow I'll have no reason to regret it. Most I'm holding until after my wife goes to El Salvador in a few weeks with SOS Hope ministries, and then soon after we have a weeklong family volunteer trip to Voice of the Martyrs HQ.  We want to see what needs we might be able to help with in each case. 
But I did give a special gift to a young missionary couple that is leaving for Hungary in a few days who I knew were short of support they needed. (Aside: the couple are the only people I've met in real life who own bitcoin, besides myself.) It was fun when a few days later my wife took a phone call from the couple saying there had to have been a mistake with our donation through the ministry website. No mistake - just the power of Bitcoin. They understood. :-)

As I write BTC is down about 2% and the alts generally are down a bit more. IOW the usual pattern of alts exaggerating the movements of bitcoin. It occurred to me the other day that margin trading in bitcoin was redundant because you get practically the same effect investing in a random basket of altcoins. Except that way we don't get margin calls... hmmm....

You're actually in good shape. But if you want to profit from the hardfork you should start reading up on how to safely split your BitcoinCash from your Bitcoin so that you can safely send the former to an exchange or whatever. Beware malware "splitting tools" that may be advertised after the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:15:04
And don't load your private keys into some new "wallet" software that appears promising to enable you to split your BCC and BTC. Yeah, it'll split (with) your BTC alright....
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:59:01
You can also buy Litecoin on Coinbase (and frankly that's what I'd suggest as the best option right now for investment, though not for trading). I think there are some exchanges out there that have additional altcoins but I don't use them. Practically speaking though, the exchanges that handle large numbers of altcoins - Poloniex, Bittrex, NovaExchange, Cryptopia and so on - none of them handle fiat currency like US dollars.
So if you want to trade in more than a few of the largest altcoins, you'll need to buy into bitcoin on a fiat exchange like Coinbase or Gemini or Kraken and then send your bitcoin to the altcoin exchange.

Miners can show support by signalling and then mining the BIP148 chain. Users can show support by dumping the non-SW chain and buying up bitcoins on the BIP148 chain. Businesses and exchanges can show support by announcing and the supporting the BIP148 chain in their operations.
Node operators can show support for BIP148, but one guy going and setting up 30 nodes doesn't mean much except to show he is highly motivated. That counts for something in one sense, but it won't win any battles.

I've used bitcoin for dozens of purchases in preference over any other form of payment. There, that was easy.
But it's also way too narrow. Bitcoin can succeed in many ways besides being a convenient method of payment - indeed, your criteria is precisely what I DO NOT want in the long run. My preferred vision is for Bitcoin to be "digital gold" and NOT a cash replacement. (I firmly believe the two cannot ultimately co-exist in the long run.) It is already succeeding quite handily in this regard. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:11:42
The BitcoinCash fork is just a private effort by a splinter group. That's something that can happen at any time. It's just that usually such efforts are better managed, over a reasonable timeframe, and attract less attention and only a few exchanges support such "airdrops". Edit: And most such efforts don't claim the name "Bitcoin" in them and claim to be the inheritors of Satoshi's Vision (tm).

You don't mine bitcoins with an nvidia GPU. You mine satoshis with an nvidia GPU. (A satoshi is 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin). Mind you, it will take you about a day to earn 1 satoshi.

ASICs are orders of magnitude more efficient than GPUs for mining. You are at least 5 years too late.

I hear you. Early this year I foresaw that the scaling debate had no easy or rapid solution and that alts would have a huge opportunity as a result.

With the UASF we are sure to get Segwit. With Barry's agreement we have to hope a lot of miners follow through, and some have a bad track record on that point. I have no confidence in that agreement at all.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:38:16
No. That's not how it works at all, as you can see simply by comparing Bitcoin TX two years ago to today. If you create plenty of transaction capacity then fees can drop to virtually zero. Miners won't like it, but will accept, say, a penny compared to rejecting a TX and getting nothing at all.
But if you keep transaction capacity tight people will pay a dollar or more if they must as is current the case. Even if you wind up with 1/10 the number of bitcoin users due to throttled adoption of BTC, you come out way ahead by keeping the fee market spiked way up. 
In the long run this drives people to other crypto and the Bitcoin TX market does dry up. But people tend not to think ahead that much, and Jihan may figure he can keep milking his cash cow for a long time before Bitcoin loses its flagship status.

This will be discouraging a segment of bitcoin users and give others cold feet. And while I don't expect it to be a lot, even 5% splintering off into BitcoinCash will cause a comparable drop for BTC. 
On the flip side some coins will be locked up and inaccessible that might otherwise be circulating. But I think on the whole this adds to the downside pressure as it reminds everyone of the risks of holding bitcoin on exchanges.

Either remaining BTC-e operators still have coins and are on the run (and probably not the least bit interested in getting BTC-e up and running again as if nothing has happened), or the US government has them now. 
The way I see it, (1) if the US government has control of the funds, and (2) if someone has deep pockets to pay the legal fees and (3) if they think they have a paper trail that can prove their crypto on BTC-e was obtained legally and (4) if they are willing to spend the next 5 years suing to get their coins back, they might just succeed. 
I think everyone else will get to appreciate US asset forfeiture laws once again. Sorry.

Insofar as the regulation is _reasonable_ and does not place a huge burden on those trying to comply, this would be a good way to reduce ICO scams.
I do think people should have the liberty to pursue  ICOs without any kind of government regulation/compliance burden - so long as they are plainly identified as such. There may be niches (such as very small projects) where it may not make sense to go through the expense and trouble, and if investors know what they are getting into I see no reason to disallow it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:32:46
My point is that the miners are a self-interested subset in the bitcoin ecosystem. If they act to control the Bitcoin protocol as some people seem to want (in effect taking on the role of central bank managers in fiat currency), they need to beware that cryptocurrency is a free market. None of us can be forced to keep buying the coins they mine like in fiat slave economies. If they do a poor job serving customers they will be fired directly (PoW change) or indirectly (migration to other alts).

OK, you have around 140 satoshi/byte fee, which would have been enough until a few days ago. Now it is way too low. That's the likely problem. Fees are spiking up badly and creating massive congestion due to all the activity in bitcoin these days.
You can check the link I gave for suggestions, or just sit tight and wait a few days. Either it may confirm this weekend when things ease up a little or the mempool will drop the TX at some point and you'll be able to try again.

It's not relevant in this case, but when people get impatient and ask questions like this it's always best to first check whether it is simply because there have been no blocks mined recently.

The rest are a motley array of anti-banking conspiracy theorists and naive newbies who imagine bigger blocks must be better because they are bigger who are being manipulated by the mining cartel behind BU.
Jihan and his cohorts were able to block things because they controlled enough hashpower. They never had credible arguments, they have been caught reneging on multiple agreements, infringing patents, installed trojans with their hardware, smearing Core and running troll armies to spread constant FUD in the absence of serious objections.

Do you mean faster block times? That's different from fast confirmations, since the one does not directly relate to the other. It would be good to clarify that.
I've heard it argued that having faster block times does nothing towards getting faster confirmations because you have to wait more blocks to achieve the same level of confidence that a TX is not going to be orphaned. And I know that the faster blocks are the more likely they are to generate orphans, which is why you don't see altcoins with block times below about 30 seconds.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:59:06
If you have Replace by Fee you could try bumping the fee up to expedite the transaction. (Or a Child pays for Parent TX) The only risk is that you are trying to move the BTC to a wallet or exchange supporting the split and you miss out.

I think it might depend on whether the public keys were derived using a deterministic wallet. That is, newer wallets use a method to generate public keys from a private key such that you will get the same public keys from two different copies of the wallet with the same private key on two different computers. This allows you to just save the private key. Older software didn't always do this, so you needed to keep your public keys as well as the private key.
That's my understanding anyhow - hopefully someone can correct any errors/misleading statements above.

Bitcoincash is causing maximum confusion. BCC currently has 3 common meanings in cryptocurrency:
1. Bitconnect - an established altcoin with rights to "BCC."
2. "Bitcoin Core" BCC Token on Bitfinex - as opposed to the "Bitcoin Unlimited" fork alternative.
3. Bitcoincash.
You must have split your Bitcoins at some time in the past to get your BCC tokens, and you just sold them away at a discount. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:34:40
That should be automatic 99% of the time. By default any exchange should be registering your account with the received bitcoins (or anything else) based on the blockchain transaction, and nothing more. The only exception I can think of would be where there is some question about a ToS violation or if things were seriously screwed up with the blockchain (like in a hardfork gone bad).

Sounds like you mined some other cryptocurrencies using your computer, on a mining pool, and they just did one of their periodic payouts. Edit: If you didn't set a wallet to pay out to, you have that amount of bitcoins in your account on the mining pool. You can either send it to a wallet you set up on your computer (or paper wallet, etc.) or to an exchange to trade or whatever.
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:47:55
No, exactly the opposite. I'm saying the PoW algorithm should be changed as often as necessary to prevent ASICs from being designed to mine Bitcoin. This keeps mining at the level of GPU/CPU mining, which anyone with a computer can in principle participate in. (Of course there would still be GPU farms areas with cheap electricity, but this would still be an order of magnitude better than what we have now with Bitmain controlling 70% of the market).

That made me a nice bit of money going into altcoins in early March. By June I was back into BTC mostly, but watching events very carefully. (And notice that I've fully changed positions on BIP148/UASF from what I expressed in the link). 
If these turkeys or anyone else continues to make a wreck of Bitcoin, I'm perfectly happy with many altcoins. They've already made me very happy. If we have to man the liteboats (pardon the pun), I hope you'll have enough sense to join us.

A public policy of PoW changes as needed to keep mining in the CPU/GPU realm would defend against ASIC-based centralization. Since the devs are decentralized by nature as an open group and no one is required to adopt their code I'm not concerned about "centralization" of devs.
Personally I expect that the policy I've stated will be implemented within the next 5 years. It's just a question of how bad things will get before the bitcoin community realizes it needs to be done. I'd prefer it be done sooner before an actual crisis (or worse crisis than we have now), as it would allow some time before the first PoW change which is more fair for miners trying to ROI on current equipment.  I'm not hostile to honest miners, just the centralization and abuse of power afforded by ASIC-based mining.
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:41:29
The miners claim to want a capacity increase while blocking and undermining it at every turn so as to jack up fees. They also only want an increase on their own terms, which means no off chain TX to compete with them. I suggest you read _both_ sides story on the Hong Kong agreement, because it's very apparent when you read both who's playing games with it. See for example 
You promise that SW2X will be activated? Because in case you haven't noticed Wright is raving about blocking it with lots of support from the anti-Core folks and the usual suspects. 
A lot of good stuff depends on Segwit. There's no need to apologize for any of that! The corporate "conspiracy" you see is just companies trying to get their foot in the door, while your monopolists keep them out. I'll worry about Blockstream when they start doing something actually bad, not because they want a chance to compete.

Why would anyone think he's Satoshi at this point?
He manipulated journalists with provably fraudulent evidence for his initial public claims, offered a clumsy and easily disproven "proof" to the public after tricking Gavin and Jon (with the former at least backpedaling rapidly when the public proof fell apart), and then offered an utterly lame "I can't do this" post on his website instead of actually providing simple proof that he had promised. 
And then there is the $50+ million in Australian tax rebates that he has scammed while conning the government and investors with this flim-flammery.
And then there's the fact that Wright's flamboyant personality is the exact opposite of Satoshi, and the fact that Satoshi's posting patterns showed he slept during the night-time of the Americas (~12-6 AM EST) - not Australia where Wright lived. 
And why would Satoshi, who gave us Bitcoin without any sign of greedily manipulating it for his own short-term profit, suddenly morph into a monstrous patent troll trying to drown cryptocurrency under a flood of johnny-come-lately patents? 
There's simply no serious evidence that Wright is anything but a con artist, unless you take Gavin and Jon's hearsay as "serious evidence." And as I mentioned, Gavin was befuddled and backpedaled when Wright's big proofs to be Satoshi fell apart so quickly in the public eye.
So what are Jon and Gavin really up to, consorting with a man who made them a laughingstock just a year ago? Something stinks to high heaven about all this.

Suffice to say I sell for short term tactical reasons, not because I am bearish on bitcoin. Maybe I should have stayed out of this thread, because by that statement I'm saying I'm not a hodler in the stronger sense of the term. 
I sold out of bitcoin into alts in March because of the stagnation in the scaling debate, and profited nicely from the resulting spike (though I now believe the spike in alts was a natural byproduct of bitcoins' rise, not a result of the scaling impasse). And then after going back to bitcoin I sold out again at the start of this month into LTC and tether in anticipation of BTC dropping as the deadlines approached for SW2X and BIP148. I'm back in now, having profited moderately again. My crystal ball for the future is cloudy now though...

I've read someone claim they had found a pattern. But as soon as enough people notice any pattern their attempt to profit off it cancels it out.

BIP148 stalls out because people are clueless or irrational and prefer Jihan Wu's control over bitcoin to a segwit upgrade. Miners stay on the legacy chain. Users become discouraged and rather than bolstering the BIP148 price they abandon both chains for fiat, litecoin or whatever. Both chains of bitcoin sag below ethereum... when they sag below litecoin in market cap it is recognized as the death knell of bitcoin and businesses who had not already done so port over to litecoin or other crypto and abandon bitcoin.
Bitcoin survives as a curiousity - antiquarians trade it or give it to their kids as a keepsake, kind of like giving someone an old silver dollar.

That's like saying if I create a paper bill and say it is worth $1 million dollars and photocopy a bunch and keep most for myself then it should be a success. It doesn't work that way. 
A coin will only succeed if people are willing to trade other forms of established value for it. A couple miners can buy up a coin like this, but if no one else finds a reason to buy in they are just bankrupting themselves because they will have no one to sell to.
BitcoinCash offers literally nothing (in contrast to ETC championing immutability, non-inflation and decentralization contra ETH) - it loses the benefits of Segwit, adds blockchain bloat and latency problems once spam fills the blocks, and the larger block is offers no benefit because even Bitcoin didn't need it once spam attacks ended. So a minor alt will come nowhere close to needing 8 MB. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:26:38
So you were leasing out your system on Nicehash?

Segwit is 90% of the bitcoin community forcing something down the throat of the other 10%, after putting up with 2 years of delays from the minority. And if you think that is still unfair, I suggest you google the terms ASICBoost and Antbleed as it relates to Bitmain and open your eyes.
A blocksize increase is the clumsiest, worst way to handle bitcoin scaling, and only to be done as a last resort if there were no other alternatives. But there are alternatives that work far better, so there is no good reason to still be talking about it in 2017.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:12:00
Plausible. At this point I'd like to think most of the market is desperate for credible alternatives to Bitmain. Do they really have the best equipment by a large margin? If not I doubt such a tactic will have much success.

Let the miners set the block size and you'll quickly see the bigger miners game this to run marginal miners out of business, leading to centralization and a migration to the best available altcoin alternatives.

Calm down. Anyone can take  a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, introduce some new rules and release it into the wild for miners to mine. Doing that has absolutely no impact on Bitcoin itself.
The confusion and risks come from the fact that it is being done on short notice, with significant interest in the new coin. That is making wallet providers and exchanges scramble to support the new coin, but that entails working out how to recognize and distinguish between the two blockchains (with their identical history up to August 1), and safely enable customers to make transactions and identify what coins they have of each type.
99% of this would not be an issue if they hadn't done it on such sudden tight timing (or if they had and everyone had ignored it).

Wow, just goes to show you can be an expert in something and be totally out of your depth in closely related subjects. 
Rogers comes off the best simply by being wise enough to admit he doesn't know about crypto and then shutting up. The 2nd naively brings up ransomware - which is about as relevant to the subject of investing in crypto as someone asking about buying Apple stock with $$ and getting an earful about drug dealers laundering their cash.
The 3rd manages to outdo the 2nd though, but claiming that the creation of additional cryptocurrencies constitutes inflation for bitcoin. This is nonsense - if an additional crypto is inflationary for bitcoin, then it is also inflationary for every fiat currency on the planet because they are all interconvertible. There's no magic firewall between fiat and crypto. Nor do additional cryptos magically obtain value without justifying themselves.
Or how about this howler: "And quite honestly, if you really think that bitcoin, once its last bit has been mined, is not going to reopen for further increases in supply, you're naïve; of course it will." 
Since bitcoin is based on user consensus - not a federal reserve board - please explain to me under what scenario a majority of users are going to agree to dilute the value of their own coins?

Well, the country I live in seizes several thousands dollars a year from me in taxes, using it to fund brainwashing against my beliefs. (I spent 16 years in the indoctrination camps myself, only to rebel when I found and began reading "heretical" literature in my last year.) If I don't pay they will seize my home. 
This practice is totally contrary to the original design and function of the government here when it was founded but is accepted as natural and unquestioned by the majority of the populace, even those targeted by the brainwashing.
Oh, by the way. I live in Illinois. I'm speaking of property taxes, used to fund government schools, used to preach a religious dogma of secular humanism with evangelical zeal. ISIS is more violent, but in some ways would be improvement over the American regime for Christians like myself.

I get this question so often I'm drafting a guide to address it, but it's not done... suffice to say you need to protect against two conflicting risks:
1. Risk of theft.
2. Risk of loss.
In other words, it doesn't do you any good to have your bitcoin on a super-secured computer in a steel vault, if the HD crashes or you forget the password. But having backups increases the opportunities for theft to occur. You need to balance these risks.
Have backups of your wallet seed/password/wallet, but in secure locations. Not labeling them as "MY LIFE SAVINGS IN BITCOIN" or password to it helps. You can put files in a ZIP file with a simple password you know and give it an innocuous name, storing it on a cloud service, to protect against a natural disaster destroying your home and everything in it.
(I don't support leaving your bitcoin online under the control of exchanges or other wallet services unless your home/computer is very insecure. You'd be surprised how often people have problems with that.)
You can store your bitcoin on a paper wallet by the way. Just google the subject for best practices on how to do this. And be aware that physical theft can still occur. Surprises me how many people seem to think that online hacking is the only way theft can happen...

Someone put $30,000,000 worth of Ethereum on a market order, which sells it immediately at whatever price is in the order books. This caused the price to plummet, which triggered stop-loss orders people had set (causing them to immediately sell their Ethereum at the best remaining price), as well as margin calls from anyone who was margin trading. That caused more automated sales, until all offers to buy Ethereum on the order book were filled and the price was basically zero.
Then the price rebounded almost instantly since other exchanges were unaffected and the price was soon back to "normal."
So some people got some very, very cheap Ethereum, and others lost their shirts. One story that came out last night tells of a wealthy trader with $120,000 in Ethereum on the exchange who had a tiny margin trade for 2.3 ETH (worth $800). When the crash hit and the margin call triggered his entire investment in Ethereum was sold off for pennies in an attempt to meet the call. He lost pretty much everything, as did the lenders to those traders. Caveat emptor!

We do need to gather our strength. It will split the chain if miners think users like high fees and congestion. (The irony is that many people here keep saying they want segwit but are opposed to BIP148 because of the risk of a chain split. THAT VERY ATTITUDE IS WHAT WILL CAUSE A CHAIN SPLIT! Show solid backing for the UASF and the miners will switch over at the point of activation if not before. Waffle and this will get dragged out and messy. But it's happening one way or another so stop surrendering to Jihan before a shot is fired.)

An ideal currency would have no transaction costs (yet with no spam). Mining fees are a necessary evil, not a good in itself. The idea that hashrate should count for votes over and against actual preferences of users is absurd.
To illustrate this, consider a scenario where miners vote to raise a TX fee on a coin to $100/TX. The miners all vote for it with hashrate while the users all reject it and dump the coin. You see, hashrate doesn't win in the end. You need to serve your customers instead of treating them as cows to be milked.

Just start googling. He's a fraud from beginning to end. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:17:05
Inflation in bitcoin is influenced by the coins released with each block reward. The block reward is cut in half every 4 years, which means that 1/2 of all bitcoins were issued in the first 4 years, 75% by the 8th year, and we'll reach 87.5% of total release by the end of the 12th year (actually a bit less than 12.0 years). 
For 2017, the block reward yields an increase in the coin supply of about 4%.
On the flip side, people regularly manage to lose the private keys to their coins. This permanently takes them off the market leading to deflation. I don't think anyone has an exact count of known lost coins but it is probably substantial. (For example, Satoshi may be dead and his coins lost, which amount to ~1 million or over 5% of the current total.)
EDIT: I should hasten to add that the changes in the amount of bitcoin in circulation is dwarfed by the changes in sentiment and demand for bitcoin over the course of the year.

You are already suffering from slow confirmation times every day here and it is getting worse. You are right that the Segwit chain will initially have slow block times, but after difficulty adjustments that will eventually be gone, and the increased scaling with the segwit chain will give it a major edge.
Of course the segwit chain will be more valued by users. Who is going to favor the high-fee, congested chain over the scaled chain that most people have been saying they want for a year or more? Only the miners. And they'll be forced to switch once the old chain is dumped to oblivion.

I went with Broad Financial (  - there are others out there but I've been happy enough with them. They help you set up an LLC - basically you create your own investment company. You have your current IRA custodian send your funds to their custodian (Madison Guaranty or something like that), who in turn sends your new LLC a check. At that point the IRA money is in your own company and you can do what you want with it. There are a few limitations from the IRS that they explain in their documentation, but it's really exhilarating how much freedom you have at that point. Not just crypto, but anything else you'd like to be investing in.

This guy gets it. He does not favor the UASF approach (I expressed reservations here myself the first days after it was publicized). But he realizes that it is the way forward.
The people who say they are pro-SW but oppose BIP148 are exhibiting very poor strategic sense. Jihan Wu has demonstrated the opposite. He is firm, shrewd and does not respect weakness. 
If you are pro-SW but concerned about a chain split, the logical thing to do is to voice support strongly for BIP148 now, 2 months ahead of time. This shows the strength of Segwit support without actually committing to anything. You're not causing a chain split by supporting BIP148 in early June!
If it comes to late July and things look shaky, THEN is the time to withdraw your support and warn against the dangers of a chain split if you are really concerned about it. But opposing BIP148 at the start of the effort is just showing weakness and dissension to Jihan. It tells him the Segwit folks aren't serious, and he can keep his stranglehold on bitcoin. 
Ironically, since many of us are dead set on supporting BIP148, showing this weakness is just creating the very conditions that make a chain split more likely. If every Segwit supporter showing support for BIP148 NOW, the overwhelming support would be decisive. The miners would know that it is useless to be mining the legacy chain come August 1 and would start switching over.
BIP148 is happening whether you like it or not. So if you want a chain split, go ahead and oppose BIP148. Because THAT is how you are going to get a chain split.

Maybe they know some things about BIP148 support that are not public yet. This is just speculation, but what if some other major mining pools are fed up with Bitmain's antics and strongarming them and have been privately threatening to throw their support behind BIP148. Then this response starts to make a lot more sense.
Simply put: If Bitmain's proposal here doesn't make any sense to us, it's either because (1) they're nuts, or (2) they have information that the rest of us don't have yet, that is bullish for BIP148 and scaring the bejeebers out of them.

I don't think this answers my question. My question is, at what precise point can I be confident that BCH has been created for the BTC I hold, so that I can then send the BTC off to some exchange that is not supporting BCH?
I don't want to wait until 12:20 UTC, send all my BTC off to an exchange like Poloniex, and then discover that the actual creation of the BCH occurred on/after the block moving my BTC to Polo. It sounds from the link above like I have to wait 6 blocks past 12:20 to be sure.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:36:19
Why do you say that?
It's critical to keep support up for BIP148 regardless of what "seems" to be happening. Right now it's all just signaling about signaling about signaling, which is a far cry from actually _getting_ scaling. 
My coach in HS always taught us to run our hardest _thru_ the finish line. That advice applies here. UASF!

Lots of excellent stuff in those tweets:
1. Futures market coming which will prove out the superiority of BIP148
2. Peter Todd saying he plans to dump his non-BIP148 BTC.
3. Samson's clear chain of logic as to why BIP148 will win.
4. Absence of any logic/argument from anti-BIP148 tweets as to how they will defeat BIP148 or that it will fail.
Throw in the BIP148 blocks already being mined today (!) and it looks like we have momentum for a scaling solution.

There was mention of a futures market a few days ago. I'm sure it takes a little planning to get it set up right, so hopefully in a week or less we'll have something.
To me the logic is simple: You'll be able to vote for a Bitcoin that has Segwit and the Lightning Network, or you'll be able to vote for a Bitcoin that has no scaling and no prospects for another year, just ever-increasing fees and confirmation times. Why anyone except a miner would favor the latter is beyond me.
Keep in mind, BIP148 is happening whether you like it or not. So if you want to avoid a messy fork and want segwit, support BIP148 now and make that support overwhelming. Because if you don't, that is what tells Jihan he can win this battle and you just guarantee a messy fork situation.

Then a lot of people will wind up letting banks control their crypto and we'll be deluged with a new flood of people complaining that they've been locked out of their crypto by their bank for some real or imagined infraction. Kinda undermines one of the big reasons crypto exists in the first place.

You'd think so, but Byteball had a similar airdrop on June 9 that did NOT result in a drop in value - which really surprised me because they were offering current Byteball owners an additional 20% as part of the airdrop.
So the market cap of Byteball jumped from $60M to $150 ahead of the airdrop (which didn't surprise me); then it was volatile around the airdrop... and then it actually held up afterwards. 
So I am no longer expecting a big dump for  Stellar, particularly since there is no incentive to stock up on it beforehand like there was for Byteball. Perhaps the recognition the airdrop brings really does work.

Thus the need for anyone who wants Segwit to show resolve and favor BIP148 NOW. If we get to late July and things look shakey you can always pull your support then. No one is asking anyone to sign in blood.
But showing weakness and indecision now may be disastrous for Segwit. Exchanges, miners and businesses need time to accommodate BIP148. But to do so they first need to agree it stands enough chance of success to spend time and resources right away to prepare. And that won't happen with people saying "I like Segwit but don't like controversy" or variations on that theme.
There's no neutral ground here, so for better or worse everyone has to pick a side. Core is currently siding with Jihan and his crew at this point unfortunately. I hope they will rethink that soon. 
Since BIP148 is happening with at least some significant support on August 1 the best way to ensure a messy outcome is to stand against it now, weakening the institutional preparations and pressure on miners. I think it will pull out a victory with 25% or more hashrate on August 1, but if it is around 15-20% things may drag out and get as messy as the author fears.

They will follow the coin with the most value. People are not going to stick with the legacy coin with high fees and slow confirmation times. They are going to go with the scaled coin with the lower fees that most have been asking for, for a long time.
That's.... logical.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:25:20
One comment: While it is rational for all miners to switch to BIP148, it is also rational for them to try to fool other miners into thinking there is no support for BIP148 so they keep mining the legacy chain for as long as possible. 
That could mean that we go into August 1 with virtually no announced support from the miners and everyone thinking BIP148 is DOA - only to be shocked by a rapid cutover among miners who were each privately prepared and want to waste no time in adopting it when it comes time.

Here is a starter article:
Coinbase is good - on a quiet day. (Tends to crash a lot lately when people get excited.) Avoid all the scams, HYIPs, cloud mining. If it sounds too good to be true it is. If you don't understand it, don't invest in it. 
Use dollar-cost averaging. Diversify (after doing some research) into other cryptos, but recognize that they largely still move in lockstep to one another most days. Study how to safely store your funds against both theft and loss due to fire/flood/computer failure, etc. Don't trust exchanges for long term storage. 
Pay attention to cryptocurrency news so you don't buy/sell at the worst times. (For example, do you understand what's happening with Segwit and the significance of August 1 and possible turmoil before and after that date?)
Best wishes with it!
Edit: As far as earning Bitcoin, this question comes up a lot. The answer is the same as anything else: Work for it. Or work for some other form of pay and then convert that to Bitcoin.

Too early IMO. August 1 is ages away in cryptocurrency terms (where one day is like one year of traditional investing horizons). I expect some FOMO from early departers like you and then you'll risk getting in when the rest of the market finally starts thinking about it and pulls out.

With Lightning Network maybe. But only if the LN is being rolled out in 2018 to give it time to mature. And that only happens if we get Segwit in 2017. And that only happens with BIP148.
Or, we could just rename Bitcoin to Jihancoin, and rename Litecoin to Bitcoin, and then maybe it could come true.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:19:27
The best way to put  someone like that on the defensive is with a question. Ask them why it is a scam. It's likely they will not have a coherent answer, which gives you a chance to explain after they fail and are forced to listen to you.
Or they do have some kind of argument, in which case now you know what their hangup is and can deal with it straightforwardly.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:21:52
This would be helpful for everyone. For example, a futures market could show whether BIP148 support is weak or strong. If strong, exchanges would be quicker to accommodate it and more miners might sign on in support, leading to a _fait accompli_ come August 1 rather than a messy fork and battle.
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:51:08
Up to a point. But then notice what happens when a technical innovation (Segwit) is introduced that is good for the community in general (leads to lower fees, fixes bugs), but bad for all/some miners (lower fees, breaks ASICBoost). This creates a conflict of interest between miners and everyone else.
Miners are not neutral players in the bitcoin ecosystem. Their role is provide security and process transactions. But because they also define bitcoin by choosing what software to run they risk destroying bitcoin through short-sighted greed, driving the users away. 
Wise miners will step back and reject the temptation to become dictators, leaving it to the community to define bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-01 03:59:26
Again, size is not the issue, decentralization is the issue. Consider 2 scenarios:
1. Hashrate goes up to 10X the current level, but is controlled by just 3 mining pools, with the largest at 55% of the total.
2. Due to a design and testing flaw, the next generation of mining chips begins breaking down after a few months in the field. With current chips wearing out at EOL and next generation hardware failing, miners drop back to whatever they can scrounge up. People pull old miners out of closets and turn them back on. New startups hastily put out new chips. The hashrate falls by 90%, but the turmoil results in new miners and the largest pool is less than 10% of the total.
In which of these settings is Bitcoin more secure?
Anonymousrev points out that something like a nation state could launch a 51% attack. But this just supports my point that decentralization is the real issue - after all, if some government obtains a large amount of mining hashrate then by definition we don't have decentralization.

The way that article is written is going to confuse people. The bottom line is that BIP148 needs to continue to receive full support until it is unambiguously clear that Segwit is locked in with the miners. And secondly, that the UASF effort is winning in its intention to achieve Segwit implementation on Bitcoin either directly or indirectly through the pressure it is causing.

Core did not write BIP148 and has been generally hostile to it, though that may be changing of late.
We don't "need" a hardfork. We need scaling. 
Core's job was to achieve consensus on the best scaling solution. They did this and provided Segwit. I don't blame all miners, but a key segment of miners have been successfully blockading it. It's not Core's fault the miners are fighting consensus.
It is apparent that Bitcoin is broken in this sense: Bitcoin is defined by the software that miners run. That means the miners fundamentally decide what Bitcoin "is." But miners are not neutral third parties in the Bitcoin ecosystem - they mine for profit, at the expense of those making transactions. This creates an inherent conflict of interest that will be a drag on Bitcoin and any other crypto that works on the same model. In the long run it must be resolved or Bitcoin will be outcompeted and fail.
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:55:20
Yes and no. My suspicion is that prices are coming down now in July and it is late in the rally, even as many people are rushing into mining. You might or might not break even buying and running an altcoin mining rig.
But you know what? It was exactly this environment when I got started in crypto in January 2014. I decided the best way to learn about crypto was to throw myself in neck deep and build my own mining rig. I ended up breaking even (barely), and with a powerful computer to replace my old desktop after a year of mining. And the knowledge gained was invaluable.
Just be prepared to spend a lot of time on it as a hobby, and to get used to the high-pitched whine of what sound like little jet engines if it's anything like my rig. And make good use of the heat - mine was the equivalent of two space heaters running 24/7.

Keep in mind the value would quickly go to zero if Bitcoin (as opposed to a personal account) were hacked.

Perhaps I should have clarified - if you want a cryptocurrency to remain decentralized and scale to this degree, off-chain TX are a must. Compression can only take you so far, and at this kind of scale the requirements would make nodes into substantial data centers, eliminating decentralization.

I'll be thrilled if we have 35% at the point of activation. If that many of the miners have acknowledged economic reality by that point the battle for segwit is practically won. Miners are not going to revert back at that point.
Keep in mind the legacy chain will also be struggling with confirmation times in your scenario. Buyers like me will be favoring the new chain while the old chain is dumped. It will be our chance to show that we favor scaling, not high fees, congestion and years of delays.

For other readers, the problem here is with the fiat payment, not the bitcoin itself. Coinbase has to sit on the trade until the funds from the OP's bank reach Coinbase so they can be sure they've got their money before they release the bitcoins to the customer. 
Am I correct in thinking you do not have a credit card account linked with them? That allows you to instantly have the bitcoin since they can just debit your card (with a penalty fee) if the bank transfer fails for some reason.

Poloniex is the dominant altcoin marketplace. Bittrex is also popular, and you can check out Cryptopia, Livecoin and NovaExchange as well. Bitfinex has some of the higher cap alts.

Because it's extremely difficult to do with an IRA, unless you want to pay a 11-13% fee for a customized IRA and jump thru all kinds of hoops and headaches to (sorta) self-manage an IRA with BTC you buy yourself. GBTC handles the security and technical side of buying and holding bitcoin so anyone with an IRA can be invested in it. Yes there's a fee but it's not out of line with other specialized IRA options. I have plenty of bitcoin in my non-IRA portfolio, but I also hold GBTC in my IRA (after getting out in June and buying back in after the dip).

Yes, but there are important differences:
1. The blocksize increase involves a hardfork; as such it takes a longer time to deploy safely so it is not done simultaneously with segwit activation. 
2. Segwit paves the way for the Lightning Network of offchain transactions. This will provide alternate routes for transactions and more competition to handle transactions resulting in lower fees. 
Item 2 is significant because while it can be argued that miners stand to earn more in the long run in a scaled up bitcoin where most TX are offchain due to increased overall volume (I believe this), some miners may fear what offchain TX due towards reducing their current fee rewards. So Bitmain (etc) have pushed hard for blocksize increases instead of Segwit.

Another factor to consider is variance in reaching the required number of confirmations.

Some reading:
Basically, come August 1 an upgrade to Bitcoin called Segwit will become available. It provides increased transaction capacity, some important fixes, and sets the stage for massive scaling with Lightning Networks. 
Many people are resisting this upgrade because they say it risks a fork (in which the old legacy version of Bitcoin continues to persist and you have duplicate coins on both chains). Ironically, their opposition to Segwit is helping ensure that such a messy situation emerges. Because the upgraded version is "baked in" to happen August 1 the only question is whether people will keep promoting and supporting the legacy chain with its  high fees and congestion and slow transactions.

The vision of the whitepaper did include decentralization, did it not? If a PoW change is the best way to maintain decentralization then so be it. My own opinion is that periodic PoW changes are likely to be needed over time.
This is an issue that will not just evaporate. A year from now things will be either more or less decentralized. I predict greater centralization unless there are new 3rd-party entrants from outside the traditional bitcoin space (the AMD/Nvidia angle). If the problem keeps getting worse it will need to be dealt with someday.

Every time someone says something this stupid another crypto comes into existence. 
I started mining in 2014, and have been hearing this all along. And the number of cryptocurrencies, and the niches being filled and the breadth of projects/technologies just keeps increasing. Saying only Bitcoin will survive is like saying only quarters will be used for payment in the future. It's just hilariously wrong. I wonder how long I'll keep hearing people say it.

It's not that it's not useful, but it's utility is limited to transactions where the $4 avg fee (per latest news) is reasonable. 
The distribution of transactions is probably like a pyramid - lots of small transactions at the bottom, fewer and fewer large transactions as we ascent. At the current fee level it doesn't make sense to use BTC except for the largest transactions. 
For remittances if you are competing with a 10% fee with Western Union that may mean a $40 transaction. For other circumstances it may mean more like $400 (1% cost to transfer). Either way, BTC is rendered useless for the Internet of Things and a host of other smaller TX. 
That's not to say it has failed or is worthless, just that it will need to coexist with other more capable and cost-efficient cryptos. There was a report I saw today that pointed out Dash and LTC have kept their TX cost down under 15 cents. (Monero and Ethereum are also getting hit with high fees.)

You can get .1% (for BTC and occasionally an alt), yes.

I don't know how it works (or if it is even possible) with a trezor. With most offline wallets though there is an option to "Sign/Verify Message" under Tools or a similar menu.
You paste the public key you want to sign with in one field and your message into another field and hit Sign. This produces a hash in the 3rd field that is your signature. It proves that you control the public key (and any funds in it) to anyone that you share the signature with, as they can use the same tool to Verify your key/message/hash signature.

No one is perfectly objective, and any honest person will admit that. 
That said, I was initially opposed to the UASF  (see

Someone did a market order for $30M worth of Ethereum, driving the price down from ~$340 to ~$225, which triggered a cascade of hundreds of margin calls and stop-loss orders that drove the price down to pennies. 
There was a report of one investor with $120,000 worth of Ether sitting on GDAX with a tiny (2.3 ETH) margin trade worth about $800. They got hit with the margin call and since their collateral was all in ETH (and thus worthless in that instant) their entire position was wiped out. $120K gone just like that.

@_date: 2017-06-26 00:06:37
I admit I'm curious. Can you explain what you think is going to happen and why?
The argument I laid out basically says that banks serve as financial middlemen, and that the existence of the internet and cryptocurrency together provide us with the tools to skip middlemen and do peer-to-peer loans, investments and so on (not to mention securely store money). I believe that even if this ultimately holds true banks will be around for a while and will linger indefinitely, just as email didn't challenge the postal service for many years, and the postal service is still around today.
So how would believing banks face competition (or worst case, extinction) lead to a financial error? Do you believe we should be heavily invested in the financial sector?

This is why I believe cryptocurrencies must ultimately be optimized for specific financial niches. A coin that is used as a _store of value_ should not be vulnerable to having its value rocked every time there is a bug in some smart contract with it. (In other words: Don't mix smart contracts with Store-of-value coins. Sorry Rootstock.)
I believe smart contracts have a very valuable place in crypto (and I hold significant amounts of ETH and ETC). But I cringe at the way people keep trying to shove all kinds of functionality into their favorite coin. A lot of it is going to backfire due to the risks created.

Bitcoin is currently limited to around 4 transactions/second. For several months now the system has been at capacity, meaning that not everyone that wants to transact is able to do so. Whoever pays the largest fee gets their transactions through. As a result what used to cost a few pennies is now costing ~100 times as much. Miners are earning these fees in addition to the base block reward which is a windfall for them.
The technical solution preferred by bitcoin software developers and users is Segwit, which roughly doubles TX capacity and provides a foundation for Lightning Networks, which will dramatically increase transaction capacity.
Some miners don't like a solution to the bottleneck as it will reduce fees they earn. So they've been fighting it openly and covertly for months now. Today the dominant miner announced plans to split off from Bitcoin in an attempt to control what they are calling "Bitcoin." This means the scaling attempt known as BIP148 is likely succeeding, and they are trying to intimidate/cajole/fool enough people into following them to ensure their version of Bitcoin enjoys some kind of economic support. Why anyone would prefer a coin controlled by a miner with high fees over the current decentralized coin scaled to ensure lower fees is beyond me, so I expect their effort to fall flat.

No, that is still too tied to a computer rather than a human identity. Think how easy it would be to create bots that browse the web to create false browsing histories, for example.
EDIT: So to explain, my thoughts thus far:
1. Decentralization means preventing the concentration of mining power in the hands of one or a small number of individuals. (This definition needs a lot more attention - you can't solve a problem without first defining it precisely and accurately. But here's what I'm starting with.)
2. How does a computer/digital system detect the existence of a unique human life, in a secure, accurate and unspoofable way? This is an essential problem to solve.
3. Related issue: How well can computers mimic humans? If a computer could perfectly mimic a human in all ways this problem cannot be solved. However, I think we are not at this point, and contra AI enthusiasts, I am hopeful that will remain true, perhaps permanently.
4. Assuming there is a way for a computer to reliably detect human activity (that cannot be replicated by AI), how can it be established that _different_ humans are acting? How can a digitial system prove to itself that it is receiving input from multiple human actors rather than one?
This is going to be non-trivial to solve...

Don't ever actually buy from Coinbase (or sell); they mark up the price that is set on their own exchange, GDAX. It literally only takes you seconds and zero cost to transfer your funds from Coinbase over to GDAX to trade yourself at a better rate, so there's no reason to take the Coinbase markup.
Edit: 
You are paying a 1.5-4% markup for the convenience of Coinbase compared to using GDAX.

It's a reasonable risk, at least for those buying currently. BTC could go to $10K in short order, for example, if it gets scaling. Or it could drop to (near) nothing if the BIPs fail or take too long and other cryptos overtake it.
Let's say you assess a 50/50 chance on these two possibilities. At that assessment buying bitcoin for $2500 would be a reasonable gamble.
Oh, and many investors are probably completely clueless about the scaling debate.

Yes. One caveat since you mention GDAX: It is linked with Coinbase in some fashion (I believe the latter basically owns the former), so you can expect an inherent link in prices between the two. GDAX is the better place to buy/sell though as Coinbase seems to add an excessive fee for the "convenience" of saving a few seconds through their interface.

Looks like it - using an algorithm that requires massive RAM would make ASICs a minor factor. It's worth close investigation. The big problem I see with it offhand is that it creates an incentive for hackers to create botnets for mining again, which is a bad thing. But there would be incentives to solving that problem - honest miners would have a financial incentive to help hunt down/prevent hacker botnets in cooperation with the anti-malware industry.

Granted about the forking risk, though I think that's only a concern if bad actors with resources commit to perpetually attacking bitcoin. I hope even Bitmain doesn't go that route.

Bitmain (headed by Jihan Wu) is the dominant manufacturer of ASICs used in mining bitcoin, and also controls a major share of bitcoin mining directly. As such they have a vested interest in maximizing revenue from mining - that means keeping the price of bitcoin up, but also maximizing the revenue from transaction fees.
That last point puts them in direct conflict with the rest of us, who as users naturally want low transaction fees. 
Bitmain also implemented a patented technology called ASICBoost that makes their chips more efficient. They deny using it, but it makes sense since they spent the time and money to implement it that they are using it in a covert form within their own mining pools.
ASICBoost is broken by Segwit, the scaling solution favored by the bitcoin community and provided by the development community ("Core"). As such Bitmain has been undermining and fighting deployment of Segwit all along. This keeps ASICBoost, and keeps Bitcoin from scaling which is causing TX fees to spike up. 
But they can't be obvious about it, because a bad actor choking off bitcoin would cause the price to tank. So they keep making noises and offering "agreements" (always later reneged upon) to make it look like they are agreeable to scaling, so people keep buying into bitcoin thinking a scaling solution is just around the corner. 
The problem here is that we have an entity in a veto position over changes to bitcoin, whose interests conflict rather badly with the rest of the community (even including other miners so far as ASICBoost goes). 
TL/DR: Support BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:27:54
"Ready" involves at least lukewarm support since it means they have evaluated it, taken any action needed to accommodate it and are ready for it. Otherwise an organization could just pick neutral.
That leaves the comparatively small slice that are against it (mostly some miners and those under their influence/control), and those asleep at the wheel or staying aloof for some reason.
Again, if there was a valid case against Segwit - which there wasn't - it evaporated when Litecoin and a half dozen other coins adopted it without issue. This is just miners ripping people off at this point.

@_date: 2017-06-16 14:55:33
My belief is that they (not all miners, but Bitmain's cartel) just say they want bigger block sizes to make people believe that a scaling solution will happen. That way they keep the price from tanking. But then they renege on any agreements before a change actually takes place.
EDIT: Larger block sizes is also a way to distract from off-chain scaling solutions, keeping all the TX flowing through the miners so they prevent competition for fees from other channels.

We really don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. There are any number of guesses, but none of them are very good at this point. (I would put the odds on my two leading contenders under 20%, for example.)
Several of the likely candidates are deceased. (Hal Finney, David Kleiman)  Satoshi seems to have been motivated by ideological/philophical concerns in my opinion - he was not acting out of avarice. If he has enough money to live comfortably such a person may leave things well enough alone until they have good and sufficient reason to act - all the more so, knowing that the minute he acts the market will go bonkers. 
The exact amount he owns is not known but I think people who study it have a pretty good handle on it. It's around 1 million BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:59:01
The only way to get Segwit within 12 months at this point is with BIP148, so I hope you are supporting it. Gregory Maxwell was saying something the other day about a compressed timeframe for BIP149, but that's probably still on the order of a year out even if some compression does occur.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:36:45
The only answer I can think of is that major pools that they've been pressuring into following their lead are sick of it, threatening to break ranks and support BIP148. We'll see if we start seeing some breakthroughs in that area in the days ahead. If/when it starts I expect it to become a flood.

"_Blockchain: Blocks needs to be done every 10seconds or so, it needs to be fast. Preferrably even every 5 seconds, as not to cause any undue delay._"
I don't think this is feasible due to orphan block rates. My understanding is that cryptocurrencies can't go less than about 30 seconds/block without orphaning becoming unmanageable. Perhaps some folks have a solution to this, I'm open to suggestions.

(He should probably be in prison for scamming tens of millions of AUS $ in a tax fraud, among other things.)
There's a somewhat longshot theory that he was not Satoshi but knows that a deceased American programmer named David Kleiman was Satoshi, and has been putting forth a complicated story about Kleiman and him collaborating and the latter having his BTC in a time-locked trust; the idea would be to scam the judicial system into forcing Kleiman's estate to hand over computers/USB drives to Wright so he can claim Satoshi's fabled stash of a million BTC. 
And then there is the way Wright's front companies have been trying to claim hundreds of patents over anything related to cryptocurrency. I wish the guy would just go away, he's a cancer on the whole ecosystem at this point.

You keep making claims without defending or explaining them, so your responses are worthless. You keep insisting that miners should dictate terms to the rest of us and we should just accept it. That's flat out absurd. Bitcoin is supposed to be a balanced ecosystem, and it is the entire userbase of millions of bitcoin owners who should be establishing policy through consensus - not just the miners handling the transactions.
Again, your position is as absurd as saying that bank tellers should, by themselves, be establishing banking policy, or that Walmart cashiers should be dictating terms to both management and customers. Miners actually ought to be fairly powerless against the entire market's opinion on matters. They should be glad to earn an honest bitcoin and have no expectation of being able to get rich ripping people off by manipulating and sabotaging the system.

He has it exactly backwards: mining costs chase the market value of bitcoin, not the other way around. If it costs $10,000 to mine a bitcoin and the market value is $15,000 then more miners will enter the market, increasing difficulty until it catches up; and the reverse in a bear market.

Yes, a bitcoin exchange would be pretty worthless if you couldn't send the bitcoins anywhere. It's pretty simple on any exchange. Just look for the Withdraw button (or Send or similar) and plug in the public key/address the seller gives you and the amount. (Make sure the exchange doesn't deduct the transaction fee from the amount. Some are kinda boneheaded about that, in which case you may need to manually adjust it.)

Or educate people on the risks of what can happen when a mix of limit orders and margin calls blows up. It's not the fault of people who laid out orders to buy ETH at 10 cents. It's the fault of people who chose to buy on margin, or placed stop-loss orders, and didn't consider the downside risks adequately. I say let it play out and let people learn their lesson. That's the best way to avoid a repeat.

The rates are daily. I see a lot of funds being loaned there at insanely low rates (like less than 1% annually), which makes no sense when you consider (1) there is some risk involved and (2) it means your money is tied up and unavailable for you to sell until the person who takes it is done with it (subject to the duration you set). The latter point tends to be especially frustrating if you want to be able to trade due to a spike or drop or other news.

Color me confused (I can't view the video) - since when is Segwit2X implementing SW via a hardfork?

Thanks to the author for sharing this lesson. 
When are phone companies going to realize they are gatekeepers to most people's wealth and identity and get serious about it? I tend to think we need several phone companies destroyed - literally - by multi-billion dollar fines and lawsuits, to scare the bejeebers out of the rest of them so they get serious about this and offer robust protocols for SIM porting.
If someone willingly signs a waiver saying they don't want to submit to the enhanced protocols, fine, that's on them. But it ought to be standard for everyone else. 
Other thoughts:
1. Shame on any organizations that are STILL offering SMS-based 2FA. In 2019??? That's insane given all the criminals exploiting it and the false sense of security it offers.
2. No one "deserves to get hacked." Criminals have no right to others' property, even if it is left alone in an open field.

I've made dozens of purchases with it, booked hotel rooms, paid for plumbing advice and made various other online purchases with it. People have demonstrated over and over that it's possible to live solely or almost solely on bitcoin, even years ago.
Meanwhile the value of the dollar keeps deflating. The dollar has lost ~95% of its value of the past century and will keep collapsing. USD has no limits on how much will be printed unlike Bitcoin, whose rate of increase will drop below even best-case USD money supply growth with the next halvening.
I can send Bitcoin around the world for pennies and minutes. With Nano it's free and instant. By contrast when my employer sends money around the world it takes days (often over a week), costs dozens of dollars (at least) and we often end up using couriers. 
This doesn't even get into issues like the absence of counterfeit bills, forged checks and chargebacks. Yes, BTC and crypto have issues, but they also have huge teams with tremendous talent mitigating those issues. Centralized fiat is dead in the water by comparison.

If you don't have trading experience, consider just diversifying into a basket of cryptocurrencies and HODLing them.

I'm just pointing out that if the dollar collapses so easily because bitcoin came along, then it was weak and going to collapse anyway. There's no reason a sensible, well-managed currency should collapse just because another good currency exists. (And given a bit of time, whatever order the USD provided could be replaced by order provided by BTC, I think.)
While I have some very different views than Bitcoin-Yoda, I do agree with him that the US has been a tremendous destabilizing force the last 25 years or so. Much of the collapse of order across the Middle East can be laid at the door of their policies, and it's not like it was unforeseen because I foresaw it and was condemning it 15 years ago (the only website to ever ban me did so because of it, not because of any vulgarity etc. on my part but simply because people didn't want to hear what I had to say - but on this instance events proved me dead right.)

I think this would require a hardfork, which is not a preferred solution. I'm sure a dev can chime in to explain the problems with this approach if they see this.
The seemingly easy, obvious solutions to scaling have not been overlooked by the development community. Turns out they are not nearly as good an idea or simple to implement as non-programmers like us tend to assume.

It's widely used/accepted and enables me to move funds around the world much faster than traditional banking systems. The transparency allows me to check on my TX coming and going with perfect detail, as opposed to the minimal or non-existent information on TX in process in bank transfers. 
The lack of clawbacks is good as well as bad, and can be mitigated using escrow agents or trusted 3rd parties where necessary. The currency has a fixed supply not subject to either controlled or uncontrolled inflation that destroys its value each year.
These are a few of the reasons I value Bitcoin. I've never done/bought anything illegal with it either (nor gambling whether legal or not).

As Tulip-Stefan says, congestion has driven fees sky-high. Reduce the congestion and the fee drops dramatically - not by 50%. 
Imagine 100 people fighting for 50 parking spaces that normally cost $0.25 to attend an event that they are paying $50-$200 to attend. They won't bid the price up to $0.50. They will keep bidding it much higher depending on much they value the event and urgently need to attend it, until 50 of them are forced to drop out. 
It's the same principle at work here. The fees keep shooting skyward until enough people literally give up and drop out of trying to do a transaction.

FWIW, here's a link to a draft presentation I had started back when I was working hard on my idea. It focuses on the surface level stuff (for the average person to give me feedback) rather than how it would all work at the technical level, so that bit is lacking.
I was trying to create a system with the right incentives for each person in the system (email senders, recipients, providers, devs, registrars and miners if PoW). If anything isn't clear or you have questions feel free to ask.

In itself SW has had a very positive price impact on other coins that didn't really need it. And they have reported zero negative effects from SW activation. So one would imagine that a scaling solution would provide a major force pushing the price up on Bitcoin.
Conversely, a messy fork due to inadequate BIP148 support would tend to scare people away from Bitcoin; if BIP148 is too weak to activate come August 1 and (as I expect) all other scaling solutions are either not happening or greatly delayed, one would expect a bearish price impact.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:41:55
Probably not - the prior block is only 6 seconds earlier.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:49:03
The good news is this does not kill bitcoin, because it is a self-solving problem. If enough people leave bitcoin, the TX drop, the fees drop, and the problem goes away. Until the price goes back up. So it throttles Bitcoin but doesn't quite kill it.
The bad news is that this gives a chance for other alts to overtake bitcoin. And that's what could kill it. If Bitcoin is just another crypto the 10 minute confirmation times will suck when virtually everything else is faster.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:03:04
The stupid thing about their effort is that if BIP148 has enough hashrate to reorg the main chain it's a signal that even miners have capitulated to segwit. And they are the last group to do so, so at that point there is going to be almost zero economic interest in maintaining the old chain. All Bitmain is doing with this proposal is reminding us of how bad an actor they are.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:20:19
No, very few altcoins use the same algorithm, at least among those with a [edit] significant market cap. If Bitcoin goes bust, 99% of the mining industry tied to it will die off as well, all else being equal.

What makes you think the price will ever recover from that &lt;$1000 mark if you defeat Segwit once again?
BTC had 85% market share a few months ago. Today we see it below 45%. Think about where it will be come August 1. Then think about what happens to it afterwards, if it is still congested, slow and expensive. 
For me it's BIP148 or bust. I doubt there will be any reason to hold BTC in the aftermath without it. Even now we're counting on Mrs. Watanabe to not be paying too close attention yet.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:35:34
That's exactly what big blockers have been doing - stalling the majority/consensus decision in favor of segwit and the lightning network. 
Big blocks are not "innovation". The do not provide meaningful scaling like offchain solutions do. They are favored only by miners (and that only superficially) and the naive. This whole line of argument by the miners and their shills has gotten pathetic. You've been blocking progress for two years and you have the chutzpah to blame the majority?

Do you expect to be able to drive down the road with zero fuel cost? All financial transactions cost something, whether it is you or something else bearing the cost. 
There was a time when you could move bitcoins for 0 fee (freeloading off the miners), but that time is long gone and presumably never returning.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:34:36
Yes, it is time, and is the least risky path forward at this point when you consider the alternatives.
The main argument I keep seeing against BIP148 is that it doesn't have community consensus. But if each person saying that would provide qualified support ("I'll support it for now with the understanding that I may pull it before August 1 if support does not grow enough") then we'd be that much closer to consensus wouldn't we?
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:56:16
Except I don't think they'd actually follow through with a HF to 2 MB unless intensely pressured, because reducing congestion will reduce fees far more than the 2X volume would compensate them for. (I.e., fees were 5 cents a few years ago versus over $2 today). 
But I agree that they'd try to push the 2 MB option over segwit all along the way.

Segwit is by far the preferred solution as the community has agreed (coin.dance/poli). The miners are being obstructions per and simple.

Bitcoin and other SHA256 coins are mined with ASICs. Scrypt (Litecoin and some others) also has ASICs I believe. Everything else (excepting PoS coins) is mined with computers equipped with good GPUs. That's the difference. 
If you want to learn a lot about crypto, GPU mining is a good way to throw yourself in neck deep and force yourself to learn a lot. That's how I started in 2014. Profitability will be iffy (depends on whether the altcoin market keeps going up), but you'll be a much more informed cryptocurrency user when all is said and done.

You're setting yourself up for headaches spending unconfirmed inputs. I know if I was on the receiving end and saw a TX to me with unconfirmed inputs it would raise a huge red flag. You won't get confirmations on your downstream TX if they are based on unconfirmed TX, which means no exchange or merchant is going to credit your funds to you until they get confirmed.

Here's my problem with conspiracy theories like this: I have no doubt at all that collusion and conspiracy occurs in backroom deals between bankers, politicians and used-car salesmen. The problem is that by definition conspiracies are hidden from the public eye, such that at best we get only bits and pieces of evidence that can be interpreted in many ways.
That means that 90% of the time conspiracy theorists will see conspiracies where none exist. And even if they do happen upon a conspiracy, they are bound to be 90% wrong in the particulars about it. We learn more about the prejudices of the conspiracy theorists than we do about the actual conspiracies from their writings.
What this all means is that people who obsess about conspiracies wind up making decisions and taking actions that are overwhelmingly not reality-based. More simply, they will generally be wrong if they act on their beliefs. Like the guy who shot up the pizza joint in Washington believing it was a gateway to a pedophilia ring involving the Clintons. 
Since I prefer to behave in ways that conform to reality, that means I'll almost always ignore the conspiracy theories and act on more solid evidence. That's not perfect, but at least I won't be guessing wrong 99% of the time.

Look again - that graph charts 7 days, and signaling for SW2X is just starting for most of these pools. For the last 24 hours it has SW2X at 37% at the moment. The 65% value is a measure of the mining pools hashrate.
Interestingly, the Emergent Consensus 24-hour measure has plummeted to 20%. Is this because it is incompatible with SW2X, or a demonstration by BU that they are accepting SW2X and laying down their arms, so to speak?

He lived in the right time zone compared to the timing of Satoshi's posting history (Satoshi seemingly slept consistently from midnight-6 AM EST(US). Not that this proves he lived in that time zone, but either he had weird sleep habits or he was at least close to the EST time zone.)
Along with Nick Szabo who flatly denies being Satoshi, Dave is one of my leading candidates. But I'd rank the odds no higher than 20% for either of them. Satoshi covered his tracks well.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:05:35
He used some British spelling, but that is not conclusive. I agree with highintensitycanada, he apparently slept during roughly midnight-6 AM EST (US) - which would be from like 5 AM - 11 AM in the UK/Europe, which would be unusual. And as far as Wright himself goes in Australia, it would be really weird if he was Satoshi and kept such a sleep pattern.

Assume the UASF is still needed. There is no safe/good reason to pull back on support of it until SW is locked in for activation.
@_date: 2017-06-08 05:15:37
I'm strongly in favor of BIP148 as I don't believe the miners will activate it in any other scenario (if they say they will, I believe they will find an excuse to back out).
If BIP148 fails to activate, I see no reason to hold BTC in the future as the slow confirmation times, congestion and high fees make it an inferior functional alternative to virtually every other cryptocurrency out there. As such I expect that many other cryptocurrencies will outcompete it in value over time. This is already reflected in the plummet from 85% market dominance to 45% today in the last few months.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:59:14
My expectation/belief is that the miners do not want any scaling because it reduces fees. But if people knew that it would tank the price, reducing the value of their block rewards. So they continually make it look like they are involved and willing to scale, but will never willingly do so. Thus agreements like segwit2X will just lead to more reneging and delays and excuses, is my belief.
This is why I have come to favor the UASF as the only viable method for scaling - because of my conviction that the miners will never actually do so without direct and powerful pressure to do so. Eric Lombrozo's experiences reflect my thinking, though I came to it independently:
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:27:48
No. You've managed to completely ignore the debate of the past couple of years and the reasons for rejecting larger blocks, which would not provide significant scaling to cover things like everyday purchases anyway.

I always appreciate his articles, but he's way too complacent on this subject.
If Bitcoin loses it's flagship status it begins to be evaluated more on its primary characteristics - things like block time and TX fees. While it may still rank first or near first on things like network security, infrastructure built around it and merchant/exchange acceptance, ranking dead last in several categories is going to hurt. People won't be overlooking those things any more when selecting a coin to use or HODL. And the longer it is Just Another Coin, the more merchants will accept alternatives, the more exchanges will add new basemarkets and so on.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:55:29
You're right. Ironically I believe the primary reason major fiat currencies have not crashed before now is because the alternatives were all equally rotten. But as cryptocurrency becomes a viable alternative to fiat the risks of fiat failing will rise dramatically. Once it starts anyone with money and sense will not want to be a bagholder in $, yen, euros, etc., and will rush to the new standard.

1. If you're a miner, it reduces congestion and thus reduces their earnings from spiked up fees.
2. If you are a user, BIP148 creates a Segwit-activated fork of Bitcoin. If miners follow users in adopting it, great, no issues. If either users fail to favor it, or users favor it but miners resist, then we have a fork that gets very messy very fast.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:45:00

Look, we have a classical Marxist in our midst.
The sort that imagines that if you value your time at $10/hour and spend ten hours sculpting a figure that is a worthless mess by anyone else's measure, it is nonetheless worth $100.
The reality is the market sets the value, not the worker. Miners can spend as much  as they want on mining but that does not set the price. Rather it is the other way round: miners expand or reduce mining expenditures based on what the market is deciding about the price.

I don't have any articles handy, but my cautions would include:
1. There is no one to save you when you screw up and send your crypto off to the wrong address.
2. Software bugs, hacks and exploits create vulnerabilities that have proven to be an ongoing problem.
3. Governance is emerging as a huge issue for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is in danger of being run into the ground by a mining cartel. Ethereum is effectively run by a 22-year old wunderkind. The "herd of cats" model of governance isn't so much better than a committee of bankers in practice. (I'm hopeful there are solutions, but I think there will be a lot of trial and a lot of error before good governance is commonplace.)
4. Scaling to fiat-level systems like VISA is still based on drawing-board models and may face unanticipated problems on the way to implementation.

Well, a question was asked, and Litecoin was the answer up above... as far as my own post I didn't even mention Litecoin, and my comment applies equally well to _any_ cryptocurrency with a shorter block time than Bitcoin (i.e, pretty much all of them).

Ultimately the users (the overall market of Bitcoin buyers and sellers) _are_ the consensus mechanism. Because if they don't like the changes proposed by Core (software developers) and implemented by the miners, the price will tank and devs/miners will either need to fix things or it all dies out.

I'm saying you and everyone else should support it so the momentum becomes overwhelming, not that it already is. I see it in danger of stagnating (though there is some small growth currently), in which case it will fail.
If it fails I'm not going to wait around to turn out the lights. With no prospects for scaling until deep into 2018 Bitcoin will be continuously shedding users fleeing the congestion and high fees and will be overtaken long before then by other crypto with lower fees and faster confirmations and capacity. My guess is litecoin will be the major beneficiary, as organizations like Yours and the CryptoAnarchy institute are already signaling.

They said they wouldn't start for ~12 hours after the BIP148 chain activates, correct? So they'd lose 12 hours in their attempt to outrun the BIP148 chain. Given the snowball-effect for BIP148 in the meantime this would be a risky maneuver.

Keep in mind hashrate will keep leaping upwards so long as the price is increasing (indeed, it is probably playing catch-up to the growth of the last few months). So within a few months or less your earning of BTC will drop off dramatically, is my guess.

Hash rate follows value. If there is a fork the miners have to follow the fork with the most value unless they care to go bankrupt. So it is the market that matters, not hashrate. 
And what this shows is the market is continuing to swing behind BIP148. The miners will be the last to do so of course, but in the end they will follow the market.

That's an interesting take. I had had a grimmer assessment of Bitcoin if BIP148 fails, but also regarded Litecoin as the "dropin replacement" or plan B for the community if it fails. 
But adopting litecoin for merchant payments, shifting funds between exchanges and other high-frequency TX could take enough of a load off BTC to allow it to thrive despite hordes of new investors, if they just HODL their bitcoin for the most part. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:14:35
Coinbase has been a traditional answer but they've gone down many times lately due to high volumes. They also have a bad habit of trying too hard to keep the government and regulators happy by enforcing their terms of service very aggressively. So look at alternatives like Gemini or Bitfinex or try Localbitcoins if you want.
Once you have bought your bitcoins, please take the time to secure them properly This means having them under your own control (not on an exchange that can be hacked or deny you service at their whim). Be careful to have securely stored wallet/seed backups in case of fire/flood/computer crashing, while also being careful about hacking or physical theft.

This is garbage being peddled by unscrupulous miners who are trying to monopolize BTC. Why  would you imagine the government would have any more power over LN channels than over basic bitcoin TX?

Let's hope it can hold out til August 1 (and the resurgence I expect shortly thereafter). 
Due to the latent strength of Bitcoin in terms of existing merchant acceptance, fiat gateways, announced projects and so on, I think it can survive being dethroned as the  crypto for a short time, and then come back when it has scaled. But that window will be pretty short since things can change so quickly in crypto.

There are still a ton of people and organizations in the gap between Segwit support generally, and BIP148 support. 
I've heard them argue why they don't want to support BIP148 because they don't want to get a chain split. But since BIP148 IS happening, their opposition to BIP148 is precisely what will lead to a chain split. So stop fighting BIP148 and support it so the momentum is overwhelming. That's the _only_ way you don't get a chain split at this point.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:37:48
I understand your motivation, but I'd rather they did process the TX so it could be tracked and eventually linked to real-world identities. Perhaps a better suggestion would be to only block TX to mixing services from this address.
That doesn't address the whole slippery slope issue, but this is a voluntary call for action anyway, and miners can do what they want.

This concern about a market dump is stupid, to  be blunt. Let's assume Satoshi (or a usurper) wants to liquidate his hoard. The sensible thing to do in such a case is to manage the sale without rocking the market. How do you plan to sell off a huge amount of bitcoin without rocking the market? Gee, turns out we've faced this exact situation before: The US Federal Marshall's auctioning off the Silk Road bitcoin.
Satoshi's not going to be a complete idiot and crash the markets, earning pennies on the dollar while he trashes his creation. He'd arrange to have it auctioned off in lots over a suitable timespan, perhaps even with a requirement that the purchased coins be held for minimum periods during which they could not be resold.
The fable of Satoshi tanking the market with a sudden sale of a million BTC is just that, a children's fantasy. Let's get over it.

Short answer is, I don't know. If you get the timing wrong it could cost a lot.
I have reasons to believe Bitcoin will do well in the near term (say, through June), so I wouldn't rush to pull out now. I'd say wait and see how things play out for the next month at least. 
Even if I were to pull out early, I could see myself scooping up cheap BTC in the last day(s) of July if they went down wildly, and just coping with the potential disruption on August 1 as best I could.
If I do pull from Bitcoin it would be to another Crypto, because they are the potential beneficiaries of Bitcoin stumbling. Ethereum would be one option (or ETC), but Litecoin I think would be the biggest potential winner, particularly from a % change standpoint. Litecoin has Segwit and the Lightning Network, and as such is the nearest thing to a "Plan B" if Bitcoin cannot scale. (I also note with interest that Shaolinfry, the author of BIP148 and BIP149, just signed on as the 1st full-time dev for Litecoin. That may be a big deal.)

I think you are right, but with this addition:
1. The value of Jihancoins will plummet. Absolutely plummet. Why would anyone want one? (Not just a shill saying they will support it, but actually buying one when the time comes?)
2. Legacy coins will also plummet. Reasons: Block times get even worse (granted all 3 will have this issue), no scaling, caught between miners and users with no particular camp of supporters left propping it up.
3. UASF coin - maybe a rocky start, but then gaining traction. The rebound will start when the community sees that the only real competition - the Legacy coin - is failing both in hashrate and price. _It does not matter what is happening with the Jihancoin at that point since it is a non-starter for the community._
Once the price starts to rebound on the UASFcoin simply on recognition that the Legacy coin is struggling miners will begin moving to it, creating a virtuous circle feedback loop. It will all be over within a few days.

It's all very reasonable, I agree. But I've learned to be skeptical of ideas that don't have evidence to support them just because they "make sense".
For example, I take notice when I see an article about a person who was convicted and served many years in prison, and then it gets proven they were innocent after all. Invariably the jury was bamboozled by an aggressive prosecuting attorney who spun a story that made it all look very reasonable that the defendant committed the crime - but without actual witnesses and hard evidence. And often there is prejudice, a racial angle, that fits into the story.
That's why I'm not going to buy this line without hard evidence, even if it does fit my prejudices.

We (i.e., the public) back it by valuing it. As more people adopt it and value it more, the price of bitcoin rises relative to the old dying currencies. For example your dollar bills (or yen/euro/whatever) are worth less and less each year. This is partly due to the "backers" of those currencies continually undermining them for the sake of debtors (i.e., the government), but increasingly because with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency we finally have an alternative.

Depends who you are listening to. BIP148 is an upstart effort. One irony to it is that it only causes a chain split if it is resisted. (Because if it enjoys majority support then there will be no split.)So the people who complain that it is risky because it creates the risk of a chain split and thus reject it, and basically creating the very condition they are worried about.
Game theory (
) suggests that (1) miners won't admit to anyone ahead of time that they'll support BIP148, and (2) that once the time comes, they'll mine it anyway because it will win. I mean, think about it. You finally get scaling which the market wants, or you reject it for continued stagnation and broken promises.

There was a dev chat about BIP148 the other day that got a little heated. Luke was pretty much alone in standing up for BIP148. The core devs as a whole see it as too reckless.
I understand their viewpoint, and the role they are playing (consciously or unconsciously). Nobody in bitcoin wants a bunch of core devs who are reckless or given to making risky changes at the drop of a hat.
But on the other hand, I think the strategic situation is dire. I liken Bitcoin to a strong kingdom riven by civil war. Many miners (upon whom the kingdom's economy depends) have risen in revolt against the legislators/rulers (core devs), leading to skirmishing and limited conflict. The miners have an economic chokehold, enriching themselves with tolls at the expense of the citizenry.
in the meantime potential enemies - the kingdoms of Ripple, NEM, etc. and especially the Ethereum Alliance have taken note, and threaten to attack and defeat the Bitcoin kingdom while it is riven by civil war. 
While some discouraged Bitcoin citizens contemplate fleeing to the friendly nearby kingdom of Litecoin or even Dogecoin, the unrest in the militia over the situation has given rise to a plan: Operation BIP148. The goal is to defeat the revolting miners by frontal assault, end the civil war and restore prosperity before the rival kingdoms can gain preeminence.
The leaders (core devs) mostly speak out against the rashness of the plan - though a few in their ranks are with the militia in this matter. But the Core majority are powerless to stop them as the militia breaks camp and marches off for their date with destiny...

There is lots of room for improvement here by everyone involved - Coinbase (and other exchanges), Verizon (and other phone companies), and users like yourself. (Lots of good suggestions in the article, BTW)
I'm especially upset at how phone companies are making it easy for thieves to operate. They need to stop thinking of themselves as simply phone providers and understand that phones are now a gateway to people's finances, and they need to take that absolutely seriously even if people whine about it when they call customer service with an issue. IMHO they ought to be on the hook financially for screw-ups like in this case.

I think a lot of long-term bitcoiners have become complacent and naive. They imagine that bitcoin will always be  just because. The fact that their favorite coin has primary characteristics (confirmation/block time and fees) that are _pathetically_ bad compared to the competition doesn't seem to faze them like it should.
I'm not waiting around for the final stand in the last bunker after August 1 if BIP148 fails. If we don't have segwit at that point I see no point in using or holding bitcoin. There is a perfectly logical basis to believe it will succeed (scaling&gt;&gt;users favor it&gt;&gt;organizations favor it&gt;&gt;miners forced to switch to it), but if irrational conservatism rules the day and the userbase sticks with the legacy chain, it will be a clear signal to me that bitcoin cannot survive long term because it is unwilling to take any "risks" (which is the greatest risk of all).

Rising interest rates makes the government debt difficult to service and thus puts pressure on the Fed to print money to dilute the value of the debt. I know the Fed would strenuously deny that's how it works, but when push comes to shove that's how it will play out if the alternative is a US government default.
So given the choice between holding dollars whose value is steadily eroded and may hyperinflate at pretty much any time, and Bitcoin with a scarcity that is locked in with no real-world chance of changing, I know which one I consider risky in turbulent times.

It's on 7 other cryptos last I heard, and I've not heard a smidgen of any issues with it. Before it activated on any there was a thread on this exact subject on Bitcointalk in which anti-segwit folks tried to convince people there was something wrong with segwit. But they failed to provide any evidence, just a lot of vague theoretical concerns or secondary type complaints about supposed lack of testing or wrong test methodology, that sort of thing. Nothing about segwit in and of itself, no hard examples of problems with it.
Doesn't mean there can never be a problem with it, but at this point it just doesn't seem like it's worth losing any sleep over.

You are not making much sense I'm afraid, but I'll try to respond: 
1. There's zero reason for miners or users of a coin to favor inflating the coin supply as that just dilutes the existing value of coins. That's why it never happens. (Occasionally I see an alt do the opposite, cutting future mining rewards to reduce coin supply, but never the opposite. And no serious coin has done that AFAIK.)
2. "being limited in it's division." If you mean adding more decimals to the maximum divisibility of a coin, that doesn't directly impact the value per coin. It just means that value can be more finely divvied up someday if ever needed. 
3. If there is more adoption and higher value per coin then yes, the transaction fees for on-chain transactions will increase. That's why the community has been working hard for OFF-CHAIN transactions like sidechains, lightning networks, merchant-exchange agreements and so forth. In the future it is anticipated that most transactions will be offchain and at much lower fee levels.

Exchanges will offer both coins in the event of a BIP148 fork because that's what exchanges do, make money off people exchanging coins. They aren't going to just pass this up and let their competition monopolize it.
So at that point you have a choice: You can prefer the centralized minercoin with no scaling, or the Segwit scaled coin that almost everyone says they want. This is not hard to figure out. And note that even if blocks are coming slow on one or both chains that won't matter because plenty of coins will already be on exchanges getting traded.
Once the legacy coins start dumping while the Segwit coins hold up better the miners will be forced to switch. You are right that you should not back a horse that is dead from the starting gate - and in this race that horse is the unscaled legacy chain. Why would you or anyone else favor it, unless your name is Jihan Wu?

I agree about the biometrics thing. I'm trying to think of something very fundamental. 
Let me think out loud for a second here... what if mining had a "pre-authentification" element to it that determined whether an entity could mine the next block? Roughly it might work like this:
1. Upon solution of the prior block, (human) miners/representatives are presented with a challenge meant to validate that they are humans - something as basic as a captcha for example, or a more elegant methodology. 
2. Miners who succeed in passing the challenge (note that this means actually having someone do so in real-time) are then validated for the current round. Without such validation their block will not be accepted by the network.
3. Issue: Could there be a way to limit the hashpower tied to such a validation event? By setting a limit on how much hashpower the network allows to be employed by a given miner decentralization could be achieved.

Not that I have a lot of Ethereum, but the fact that it bounced back so effortlessly shows the support for it is rock solid at this point. 
The crash was a combination of a naive or cunning bearwhale dumping $30M in ETH on a thin orderbook, causing a cascade in margin calls and stop-loss orders. GDAX is at fault for not compartmentalizing margin trading collateral, and the margin traders and limit sellers are at fault for not recognizing the risk and vulnerability of their situation (granted, this is not something most of us can spot very readily). It's not the fault of ETH as a currency though.

Wow, talk about dangerous advice. Railing against diversification in your investments is spectacularly bad thinking. Notice that he wrote this in 2016. Anyone paying attention to it missed out on the 1000% rise in market cap of altcoins this spring. And what if people blindly hold their BTC and it turns out not to scale and withers and dies over the next year amidst an otherwise booming cryptocurrency market?
Of course there are lots of scamcoins. Of course people are throwing money blindly at anything on Coinmarketcap at the moment (and will get savaged once people start doing hard thinking about likely winners and losers). But what the author misses is that finance has many niches and usages, and therefore there will need to be many difference cryptocurrencies with different optimizations tailored for each. I fully expect there will be dozens or hundreds of successful cryptos in the long run. Stores of value, convenient purchasing, smart contracts, prediction markets, asset markets, anonymous currencies, B2B currencies and many more will all have their place.

I don't think a limit price would have saved them, because what sucked all the collateral out was a margin call trying to restore the funds the lenders had provided. Unless the limit price had kicked in before the massive cascade of selloffs I think it would have been useless.
I'm not an expert in margin trading so I'm sorry if I can't answer your questions well enough. I actually lost about $3K last month making a newbie mistake margin trading myself, when I used the same funds (LTC) as the margin trade involved on Polo. This caused a margin call after about a 10% decline since the collateral was losing value at the same time as the loan itself. Moral: Never ever ever margin trade using the same currency for both collateral and for the trade itself....

1. Users will establish value.
2. "Economically important nodes" will jump to where the value goes, or become "Economically unimportant nodes."
3. Miners will mine the chain that is profitable, or go bankrupt mining the unvalued chain.
The users/market is in the drivers seat now. The choice is between a Segwit-upgraded Bitcoin ready for the Lightning Network, or an unscaled Bitcoin with congestion, high fees, slow confirmations, and just promises that have so far been empty that it will all be fixed someday. I predict it will be easy for the market to decide between the two.

Not only are they not the same thing, they shouldn't be the same thing. 
Velocity of money is high for a payment token, which reduces its value. Velocity of money for a store of value is low, enhancing its value. (This is basic economics.) Trying to do both with the same thing, like the Bitcoin community keeps trying to do, is a fundamental error.
My 2 satoshis is that we focus on maintaining Bitcoin as the most secure store of value on the planet. Digital gold for the future. For payments something like Nano (instant, and free) is a better alternative. Even in a best case scenario for the LN it is not free, extremely complex and requires locking up coins that could otherwise be deployed in more economically productive ways.

No. No, no no. 2 MB will not provide double the fee revenue. It will provide maybe 1/10 the fee revenue compared to right now. 
When there is more capacity than needed for TX, the fees can drop off to essentially zero. For example, let's say you go to 2 MB while only 1.5 MB blocks are needed. In that case I can put my TX out there with a fee of 1 penny. Since there is excess capacity a miner knows that if he doesn't include it in his block the next miner will, so he takes the 1 penny instead of losing it. Better than nothing.
By contrast when there are more TX than capacity a bidding war develops. The prices rise until enough people flat out give up. That is what is happening now, as people are (1) giving up on emptying wallets with dust TX, (2) switching to litecoin, dogecoin, etc., (3) delaying or canceling transactions, (4) making fiat payments with merchants who accept bitcoin, etc.
Granted, spam use of the blockchain for advertising etc. will keep the fees from going to zero when there is excess TX capacity available. But as we can see from the prices when there was excess capacity before last year, compared to now, the miners will not make more money with larger blocks. It won't even be close. At least not until TX volumes rise so much that much more than 2 MB is needed and they can repeat this.

With BIP148 if the non-Segwit side does not capitulate (in terms of mining hashrate), there will be a fork into a segwit and non-segwit (or legacy) forks. 
So long as the legacy fork has more Proof of Work it will survive. Once the Segwit fork surpasses it in PoW the legacy chain will cease to exist, unless a special effort (checkpointing) is made to preserve it. However, I would not expect such a chain to be economically viable, because miners are the last to support Segwit. If they've switched away from the legacy chain it's because the user community has forced them to do so, making the legacy chain fairly worthless at that point.
It is likely that there will be turmoil as we approach August 1 if neither side is showing decisive strength. In such a case many people may adopt the simplest solution of selling their coins and sitting it out. Others will be buying and selling tactically, with an eye towards dumping their coins to depress prices on the chain they do not favor. We can expect some wild volatility until a resolution is reached in that case.
If BIP148 succeeds I would expect a resurgence as it will mean bitcoin has finally scaled and will be ready for Lightning Network scaling shortly thereafter. Failure will mean it has to wait until 2018 at the earliest for further attempts to adopt Segwit. But with the rise of many altcoins and the severity of the fee crisis that may be too late for Bitcoin to retain its position as the flagship of cryptocurrency.
Thus, for many of us, August 1 is Bitcoin Independence Day, come what may.

There are a number of reasons that have been hashed and rehashed many times. It's not a long term scaling solution on the scale of mainstream adoption so offchain solutions are going to be needed anyway.

You can split blockchains just like you can "split" money by printing more of it. But a split blockchain will involve two difference development communities and protocols and parameters to each coin. This is comparable to two different fiat currencies. 
And so just as fiat currencies are valued differently, each blockchain is valued uniquely by the market. If Bitcoin's value could be drowned in a sea of forking blockchains it would have already happened - just look at the hundreds of cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com - it's been that way for years. Yet the major cryptos dominate the market, not arbitrarily but for fundamentally rational reasons.

Use GDAX directly, not Coinbase. Or use Gemini. Then you are getting the market price directly. If you fund from your bank account (ACH) there is no fee beyond the exchange fee (and that's 0% for a maker order on GDAX).

I sure wish exchanges would charge the actual fee for bitcoin withdrawals. It's annoying getting hit with a bunch of .001 or .0008 BTC fees when you know their cost is lower due to batched transactions. (Kudos to Poloniex on this score at least.)

I'm surprised how many people resist this reality. If a significant enough minority sticks with BIP148/Segwit it _will_ win in the end. 
I'm even thinking through a scenario where it may take years (imagine a ETH/ETC style long term division), where the superiority of the BIP148 chain eventually catches up and crushes the legacy chain despite a horribly slow start. The key in this case is simply that people don't give up. After a few difficulty adjustments such a chain could start thriving and attracting a stable share of ideologically unaligned miners. The similarity to the legacy chain means it is easy for businesses and exchanges to add it as an option, and the failure of the legacy chain to scale creates continuous significant incentives for people to switch over. Maybe even a few of the businesses that have been switching to Litecoin switch back to the SW-Bitcoin chain. Eventually the chain picks up steam based on this superiority and popularity and pulls ahead. (Even if the only chain is preserved via checkpointing, at that point it's economically dead since there is no point for anyone to be using it any more, except maybe as the digital version of an antique.)
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:38:44
What evidence do you have? I'm as pro-BIP148 as anyone, but I keep seeing this claim without any supporting evidence. And miners would have a vested interest in supporting their own coin, not displacing it with another.

One important thing to keep in mind with those charts is that back around the end of 2013 when the price exploded, the recommended default price per TX was dropped in the dominant wallet implementations. I think it was .001 BTC/TX, and was dropped to .0001 or something like that. (I can't remember exactly, but I was just getting started in Jan. 2014 and it was a big deal at the time). 
The rollout took some time and people were manually making changes in an uneven fashion all through 2014. So basically the earlier data is messy to use because overwhelmingly fees were NOT being dynamically calculated, they were just left at a default most of the time in many wallets. People who knew better would adjust them down to various values, but without the tools we have today they had no conception of a fee market or what was competitive, and since free transactions went thru regularly it didn't really matter. It was more a goodwill donation to miners than a necessity.
EDIT: I can remember when people started to complain about "stuck" free transactions after waiting a much shorter time than people are often waiting today, and people would berate them for not giving anything to the miners and just pay the $0.02 or whatever it was at the time. Times have changed...

Indirectly. It was only on GDAX, where a $30M market order dropped the price about 30%, which triggered a torrent of margin calls and stop-loss orders. The order book was thin enough beyond that point that it fell to 10 cents before almost instantly recovering.
GDAX came out today saying they would reimburse everyone who was hit by a stop-loss or margin call, which I think is a huge mistake. But I guess it's their money, so it's not quite the same thing as The DAO bailout.

I don't have a perfect solution either. Changing PoW at some frequency could be done to prevent ASIC development. This would keep mining at the CPU/GPU level allowing anyone to participate. But large CPU/GPU farms would still be most efficient and would tend to dominate mining, so even this is not a final solution.
Resolving this needs to be an ongoing priority until we are successful though. If someone had asked me when I think we should panic regarding centralization I would have said something like having 40% of ASICs from a single source would be a threshhold for panic. Then I heard that Bitmain's share was more like 70%...

I'd say you are a polite bitcoin maximalist.
As a way of contrast I'd say of myself:
1. The flagship coin need not be a petrified fossil - if other coins earn their way to the top, the very fact that they've done so means they will have earned the trust of the market.
2. *shrug* Not sure this is a significant distinction.
3. I agree about smart contracts. They introduce an element of risk which is why I believe their use _must_ be minimized with a coin meant to be a store of value (sorry Rootstock). 
4. I believe there are many financial niches, not just a few, and that the optimization of coins for each niche means we will ultimately see dozens (at least) of successful coins, even allowing for adaptations within a given cryptocurrency. Even "store of value" may become broken down into multiple layers - do you value stability most? Or security? Or fungibility? There may be a distinct store of value coin for each flavor someday. Bitcoin may remain fully "successful" but ultimately be only a small fraction of the total crypto market cap.

I can't find a link now (I saw two separate accounts of it last night, one was on r/bitcoinmarkets). Here's what happened:
1. Investor has $120,000 worth of Ethereum on GDAX, and no other funds in other crypto/fiat.
2. GDAX does not compartmentalize your margin collateral, so all your funds are potentially available to be used in the event of a margin call.
3. Investor opened a small margin trade for 2.3 ETH (value $800).
4. A bearwhale decides to dump $30M worth of Ethereum with a Market order.
5. This drives the price of Ethereum down as mentioned, triggering margin calls and stop-loss orders that cascade down the order book; there are not enough Buy orders to cover the flood of orders so the price flashes down to pennies.
6. The hapless investor's margin call is part of the flood; the collateral is sold off to USD by the system to try to meet the call, but at only pennies per ETH their entire amount of what was $120,000 worth of Ethereum is unable to generate a few hundred USD at the "new" price. As a result they are wiped out.
Hopefully GDAX/Coinbase will make some changes after this, such as compartmentalizing margin trading funds like Poloniex does. Also, if this guy had just had $1000 in USD (or maybe BTC if the system was smart enough to use it) in his account, he would only have lost a few hundred dollars.

I like your ideas! The main difference between them is that I wanted Email 2.0 to be a "blank slate" implementation so that any other ideas that email protocol experts have wanted to implement, but couldn't due to backwards-compatibility concerns, would be incentivized to support it. I'll grant that it also makes my project more complex and yours more likely to see the light of day, at least in the short run.
If you don't mind I'll dust off an old powerpoint I developed to share my ideas tonight and put a dropbox link here if you wanted to take a look at it. You might find some ideas worth considering even if the overall architecture is too different to merge them.
Also, while I haven't shared my overall idea outside my family before now, I did propose one element of it on Bitcointalk a while back as a standalone idea. My "aliascoin" concept was meant to provide a secure way to replace public keys with easily remembered ASCI text, so that you could just send funds - or an email - to "JoeSmith" instead of "1Ayena83c..." or "Joe.Smith123 I think this is a vital improvement needed for mainstreaming cryptocurrency, and would be a very worthwhile improvement for email as well.
Here's the aliascoin link:
PS: I think you have the right idea with _"Most likely solution is that the header contains the encrypted private key, and chain TX contains the key to decrypt that private key to claim the coins, or vice-versa?"_ My concept involved an encrypted header that the email provider (only) could read, along with the encrypted email itself. In my model the email provider as well as the recipient are paid, with the recipient needing to provide data (encrypted in the email itself) back to the provider to enable the provider to post the transaction paying both of them for the email. This way people couldn't game the system - the provider can't get paid without delivering emails, and the recipients can't stiff the providers without losing their own payment. (This model provides providers an income stream so they don't need to earn a living spying on email users, which would be eliminated anyway due to the encryption used.)

Back in March I predicted the rise of the Altcoin markets ( due to the lack of scaling in a reasonable timeframe. So yes, I would expect that Litecoin would deflate somewhat in the aftermath of bitcoin scaling. I expect this would be true of most other alts as well, though some with specific use cases (smart contracts, prediction markets, Zcash and so on) would fare better than others.
Diversification is a good idea in any case, so I'd say go beyond what you suggest and take a look at ETH/ETC (I hold both but am more bullish on ETC), NEM, Stellar, Zcash, Dash, Gnosis/Augur and so on as well.

By heretical literature I simply mean fairly traditional Christian apologetics. As a dissident I recognize what seems very hard for the average person to grasp: that rather than being "neutral" or "irreligious" the American state and culture are extremely religious indeed. (One easy way to prove secular humanism is effectively the state religion of America is to point out how little would change if a law were passed openly establishing it as such. Apart from a few small points regarding chaplains nothing else would change. Edit: And two words in the Pledge of Allegiance and on some coinage, someone once pointed out to me.)
As a Christian, ISIS would be an improvement insofar as their opposition is overt and not covert - open persecution and not the petty harassment and death by a thousand cuts of American government. Both have the same ends - America since at least the early 90's has had a steady policy of breaking down bulwarks against Islamic aggression worldwide, breeding jihadists in as many countries and possible and driving genocide and mass exodus of Christians in areas thus affected from the Balkans and North Africa, across the Middle East and on to Indonesia and the Phillipines.
While ISIS demands taxation of Christians when it isn't murdering them, I've not noticed any reports that they use the taxes in a targeted manner to attack Christian or seize their children and train them as janissaries. (Though I wouldn't be surprised on the latter.) In this one respect ISIS is frankly preferable to the American practice where Christians are taxed to fund the indoctrination camps to which their own children are sent to be trained against Christian teaching and faith, as I experienced.
(Note that under the original plan of the American republic schools were strongly encouraged - see the Northwest Ordinance for example - but no government or "public" schools existed, so the centralized preaching and teaching of a State dogma cannot have been the Founders intent. Thus per the 9th and 10th amendments all funding for such government institutions and related activities by the Federal government are unconstitutional. )

Decentralization is always a good thing, but if you are paying more for electricity and overhead in the long run the more efficient miner wins in the end anyway. 
Keep in mind that fundamentally the market is in control, because if the miners get too stupid milking their cash cow the market will tank as people find a better cryptocurrency, and the miners will be bankrupt with a pile of useless equipment and worthless coins.

"Miners" collect transactions and compete in a cryptographic puzzle in which the winner assembles a block of transactions and is awarded some new bitcoins with each new block. The block reward was originally 50 bitcoins in 2009 and is halved every 4 years, so we are currently at 12.5 bitcoins/block. Each block occurs every 10 minutes on average (exact time is random). A total of 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined. And on the flip size, many have already been permanently lost. This scarcity is what is driving the price up, combined with the demand.

I know there is an argument that spam will fill blocks regardless of size, but I'd simply point back to our experience circa 2015 when blocks were not full yet. We had 5 cent TX because when there is space available you can set a very low fee and a miner will still accept it, because the alternative is they skip it and the next miner  gets it. So it's better to take it than get nothing. Unless the miners start colluding that would be the expected result.

Please don't be naive. The miners just threw out the blocksize increase as a way to distract and create dissension from the community consensus, and make it appear the miners are also interested in scaling. If the community had said "OK!" the miners would have immediately found some excuse as to why a block size increase couldn't be done. Because such an increase would have ended the congestion and reduced the fees the miners are earning.
The miners will never willingly scale except as a last resort. So long as they have people doing their bidding in undermining the community they can keep laughing all the way to the bank.

Is Civic designed to robustly prevent the establishment of false identities/aliases?

Litecoin is an obvious choice. Bitcoin miners who think users have no alternatives could consider that many alts today have market caps as large as bitcoin a few years ago. There's a reason bitcoin has declined to 40% market share, and no reason why it cannot plunge further.
The commercial infrastructure behind bitcoin is significant, but recreating it for other coins can be done in a fraction of the cost and time since bitcoin blazed the trail. If enough miners keep mistreating users we may find out just how fast.

I think you mean bitcoin maximalists in that least sentence?
Personally, I reject both BU and bitcoin maximalism. From an investment standpoint diversification is just prudent common sense. And from a technology standpoint, I've been a firm believer from my earliest days in bitcoin that coins would necessarily become optimized for specific different financial niches. Originally I spoke of 4-5 dominant and successful coins, then dozens. More recently a journalist using the same logic spoke of hundreds of thriving cryptocurrencies, and I think she was right. 
There will be some multi-purposes utility coins, but in general coins that try to do too much will be outcompeted by coins that optimize to serve a specific niche as well as possible, IMO.

If you are a merchant trying to support cryptocurrency you can't expect people to shell out $4 in fees to buy a $50 widget. Litecoin has fees still down around 10-15 cents by comparison and is the nearest thing to a drop-in replacement due to its historical similarities with bitcoin.

This is why you need Segwit. And you need to plead this case to the miners.

I'd suggest Gemini or (on a quiet day) Coinbase.

As I mention above, you could consider the email providers being paid as well as the email recipients. The cost could be based in whole or in part on the size of the email. This would help eliminate any restrictions on email size that are currently in force, and incentivize email providers to deliver emails.

FOMO. There has been a lot of positive news coverage about bitcoin being the new "digital gold" and rising in value. So now we have lots of new, fairly clueless investors rushing in.
An alternative explanation that I tend to favor as well is that bitcoin is being inflated simply by people buying it so they can get to exchanges where they can buy other cryptocurrencies that are rising in value much faster. Most of those smaller cryptos have few or no direct ways to purchase from fiat yet, so as long as they are growing it helps bitcoin indirectly.

Most wallets have an option to let you view the details of the transaction (see "Preview" in Electrum for example), including the number of bytes. From that you can multiply out the amount in satoshis required, and set your fee accordingly.
Note that the backlog reduces somewhat over the weekend.

The same as for any other bitcoin transaction. Blocks occur on average about 10 minutes apart (actually slightly less than that when hashrate is being added which is normally the case, if you want to get precise about it.)
Anyway, that is an AVERAGE. Sometimes you get 2 or 3 blocks within a few seconds of each other. Sometimes an hour or more can pass before a new block is mined. Since you typically need 3 confirmations for a TX to be considered as received this means you might wait less than a minute, or you could be waiting a couple hours.
You can check if the holdup is with the service you are using not sending the TX by looking for TX details on their website, and by watching the propagation of blocks at coin.dance/blocks (bottom of the page). Once they provide a TX though, it's out of their hands and just a matter of statistics...

If a bunch of bitcoin is invested in a Rootstock contract like Ethereum was in the DAO, it would rock the bitcoin market if a hacker stole it or a bug caused it to go into a black hole like we have here.

No one forced anyone else to participate in these trades. Every trader chose to place their orders of their own free will. Whether the $30M dump was calculated to cause the cascade or was due to the naivity of an early adopter, no one was tricked or forced into this situation. 
Whereas if someone starts saying this wasn't fair and that trades should be reversed or losers reimbursed, then you are very dramatically attacking people's liberty and forcing them into transactions they totally oppose. Plus there is no end once you start the bailouts if you are consistent. If it's not fair for someone to lose 99% of their investment then it's not fair to lose 90%, or 50%, or 10%. 
I know you mean well, but the road to Hell is paved with such good intentions. I was only a spectator to this event but like most people here a few years I've got my share of shrapnel from other events. You live and learn, and most of all you appreciate the responsibilities that come along with liberty in cryptocurrency, unlike the bailout culture of the welfare states.

The crazy thing is, that expensive overkill calculator I bought back in high school in the 80's still works. On the original battery. (I pull it out every few years and fire it up.)

Yeah, I found the same thread too. It's too bad the original Sourceforge forum it references is no longer available.

My reasons for thinking of Litecoin as the best alternative in the aftermath of a Bitcoin implosion would include the following:
1. Ethereum has the next largest market cap, but is geared to a totally different purpose and is far too centralized under Vitalik Buterin's guidance. As a store of value it's too vulnerable to being rocked by poorly implemented smart contracts blowing up on a regular basis. So it's out.
2. Bitcoin Cash was created by miners and for miners. It rejects scaling solutions for mainstream adoption (Segwit and the Lightning Network) in favor of keeping all TX on-chain so miners will monopolize fees. It's leaders have openly advocated massive centralization of nodes in a massive data-center model, making it vulnerable to government coercion and control. So it's out. 
3. Beyond Litecoin you have either coins with specialized purposes/use cases (which is perfectly fine, but not a Bitcoin replacement) or too small and narrowly held. Mass adoption of the smaller ones would certainly enrich the current holders but a lot of scrambling work would need to be done by devs to make it more capable (excepting maybe a few like decred and vertcoin) to get Segwit and other upgrades implemented. It's unlikely the Bitcoin userbase would all agree on one smaller coin out of hundreds anyway.
4. Litecoin is an older coin and comparitively widely held with a market cap almost as large as bitcoin was not so long ago. It shares a common history and technologies like Segwit and Lightning Network development that would make it philosophically and practically easy for Bitcoin devs and businesses to adopt it. Charlie Lee has always impressed me as a very level-headed guy, and the first regular Litecoin dev, Shaolin Fry, was the dev behind the UASF effort. It just strikes me as the natural liteboat... erhhh, lifeboat... should one be needed.

A day ago it had basically zero hashrate. I wasn't expecting it to be winning blocks already, but it is. But even if it is still very low hashrate come August 1 people can still trade with it on exchanges. That will signal to the miners what they need to do.

Yes, I don't like how their Markets tab shows they are heavily weighting the calculations based on BTC/ETH and other altcoin trading. The USD price should be based on USD trading alone, not trading in other currencies that have a volatile price in USD themselves.

I would not expect it to simply mathematically repeat earlier cycles, but if it somehow did we should see it rise to around $6K or a bit higher, and then plummet to around $1000-1500 before starting a new run for $25K in a few years. 
But such predictions ignore real-world factors so I can't take them too seriously. I can give you a scenario for Bitcoin at $500 in two months or at over $10K. Probably better just to hodl.

r/btc is a lovely place for learning things that are true in an irrelevant sense and quite false in the ways that matter. If no other exchange covered it, whom do you think would subsequently get all the volume? (And by the same token, what do you suppose other exchanges would do once they saw Bitsquare earning large amounts on such a market all by itself?)
