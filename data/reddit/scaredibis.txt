No i am saying that if each block on the bitcoin blockchain was 8 times bigger, they could hold 8 times as much transaction history. Therefore the amount of blocks created AS OF NOW would be less because we would be able to store 8 current blocks worth of transaction history on one 8mb block. The number of completed transactions wouldn't change, just the number of blocks required to store them all.

wouldn't there be 8 times as many transactions per block, meaning that the block chain would only contain 1/8 of the total amount of blocks? (making it the same size)

no im not trying to confuse anyone, my intuition just tells me that since each block is 8 times bigger, it could hold 8 times as many transactions. Thus only 1/8 of the total number of blocks would be required to store the same transaction history that is being stored now.

your argument is assuming that the devs convert all blocks to 8mb and leave 7mb empty on every block (instead of condensing the transaction history and filling up all the converted blocks. I know it would be super difficult for them to figure out how to condense the blockchain so that all blocks were full, but I'm fairly sure that they wouldn't just leave the converted blocks with 7mb of empty space if they were to make a change that drastic

How about going and contributing to a sub you actually like

At first it would cause a lot of fud and the prices of all coins would probably crash even harder than it has been recently. The devs and other members of the crypto community that genuinely want a new financial system would be rallied up and mid-long term progress on implementing this could potentially be accelerated. Then everyone else would eventually die off and the newer generations would all adopt cryptocurrencies.

It wont go negative, it will just reduce by the same percentage that the bitcoin price does.
So if you have some amount of bitcoin worth $20 and the bitcoin price drops by 50%, you have the same amount of bitcoin, its just worth $10 now. 
The lowest it will be able to go is $0 (100% decrease)
