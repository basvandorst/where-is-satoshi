You know what will happen, technological superiority will prevail (lightning, schnorr, simplicity, confidential transactions).
Bitcoin, thanks to UASF and incorruptible world class developers has put itself at the forefront of cryptocurrency technology and quality.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:55:33
I'm just saying they have proven themselves incorruptible, besides I'm not talking just about the bitcoin core software developers, but also about a significant number of developers in the community.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:12
Bitcoin is still superior that's why it takes time to implement things, because they are done well.
The proper solutions are in final stages of development/deployment, and puts bitcoin at the forefront of technology, I'm sure you have heard about all of these: lightning, MAST, sidechains, simplicity.
Segwit was implanted on the network just a few months ago (in august), that open the door for all the improvements, this will, in time leave others behind specially if they fail to follow on bitcoin development.
Anyways, it's always a bad or a good time, it all depends if you can hodl while weak hands fall to the panic.

About percentage of volume it's difficult to say, but I'd say an often overlooked use is services payment, specially for programmers, the kind where you get paid every month, I know a some in this situation for some time.
About what you can buy, you tcan probably buy most of the things you can get with btc using fiat, but you don't need permission to use cryptocurrency, getting bank account, visa etc can be a hassle.
About who owns what part of btc I wouldn't say is so crystal clear, many people have btc on exchanges that have huge accounts, but it's not their money really.
It's better than a bank because "they" can't close your account at whim. Also, the money policy is dictated in code, not behind closed curtains.

I think they are incorruptible because the work for bitcoin, not for external forces. They are much more interested on technology itself than on short term gains, and even in the face of attacks they will never compromise the long term for short term gains, which is why we're seeing safe efficiency gains being implemented first, deploying those first to then think about what's best for the next steps. 
As an example [electrum]( developers have only implemented final segwit support with new style bech32 addresses instead of going with the more short term p2sh backwards compatible addresses. It's not helping short term that much, but you have to respect them for thinking in the long term in what's best for the network.
Bitcoin itself has favoured improving byte efficiency first and kept block increase within safe limits (up to 4mb), as well as pushing for 2nd layer technology with potential for increasing the throughput of the network at least one order of magnitude (and possibly 2 or more) without compromising it's base resilence.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:12:10
Agree 100% with that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:31:06
This is about Bitcoin, and generally not the place for alt discussion or promoting otherwise would get filled up pretty fast.
Note Bitcoin is also past the 1MB but to take more of the block you know also services need to be upgraded and some are taking their time also I think bitcoin core version with segwit wallet will help services a lot since many probably depend on it.

He's arguing fees have a role but not necessarily advocating high fees, since he's advocating LN as a solution for low fee txs.
Cryptocurrency is about decentralization, other alternative currencies where created in the past and got taken down due to being centralized.
With the level of growth we're experimenting it's normal solid solutions are taking time to be implemented, but that's what will make it big but still having the qualities we love about cryptocurrency. Take it easy, good engineering takes its time :) It's like if you have a bridge and too much people is trying to go over it risking taking it down, you can say, let them all in at once! Keeping people at the doors is against the whole idea of bridges, but you know, engineers are building better pillars to make the bridge bigger and still solid. Take your time to savour the process, since it's all open and welcoming for people wanting to help in building.

Growing pains. Technology is already on the way don't despair. Meanwhile bitcoin is resisting where others would already have collapsed or sold off, it's taking a bit to implement the changes with the needed testing, but everyone can help and this is surely going forward since there's a ton of changes in the pipeline.

To speed it up you would need to spend the unconfirmed output with a higher fee to make both confirm, depending on your wallet it might be possible but not on exchanges.
The fee itself doesn't seem that bad, you are around 600 sat/byte, currently higher than 800 are confirming, a lucky block streak could get it confirmed in some hours, otherwise if the network saturation continues it could take days but I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:18
Short term stop gap is services and wallets striving to implement segwit earlier.
The problem with short term patches that will weight for life is that you can't undo them later compromising the resistance of the system. Afaics development is advancing at good pace and it's a good moment to lead a hand and learn!

Bitcoin is leading the path forward. Don't get me wrong I like Monero but in no way does it have the tech to become world class due to scalability issues. As other altcoins it was born on the ideas that wouldn't make it to bitcoin due to lack of quality in those features. 
[Properly designed features]( take time and lots of work, but they are coming to Bitcoin and others will follow.
Also, I think you can advertise your alt without bashing others... cheers.

@_date: 2017-12-01 09:15:41
That's just part of a social attack. Bitcoin is right now implementing [game changing features]( and the [protocol was upgraded]( around august after resisting multi-million dollar attacks thanks to incorruptible devs and a great community.
Bitcoin will remain top cryptocurrency and any altcoins not able to keep the pace of development will fall behind.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:19:17
The debate is but a farce (or a part of a multi million dollar attack depending how you want to see it). Bitcoin is leading the way forward with features implemented in the right way with the biggest group of world class developers.
Altcoins in general have mostly born from features that where discarded in Bitcoin due to those features lacking in quality and resilence.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:12:20
I'll try to explain a bit, every altcoin has always implemented those features that Bitcoin would not pick up due to lack of quality and resilence, things they don't have to worry much about since not leading they don't have to resist attacks like Bitcoin is doing, would any of them "take the lead" those bad features would come back to bite them (actually all of us) in the ass and they know it, also the market knows that.
Good features take time to design and implement but right now Bitcoin has a good number of them on the pipeline (MAST, lightning, sidechains, simplicity, confidential transactions), aiming to solve some of cryptocurrency historical weaknesses (will bring increased base block byte efficiency, instant cheaper transactions, much increased throughput, increased privacy, provable contract development...), all carefully designed with the best engineering process.
This year things have been delayed due to social and high profile attacks designed to generate confusion and delays, but even in the face of that, finally the protocol was upgraded after 1 august thanks to a community based movement called UASF. That is, Bitcoin has resisted multi-million dollar attacks (probably attacks spending hundreds of millions). Now the protocol is ready to start deploying at least some of those features.
You can read a bit more about advances in the pipeline here: 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:29:48
It does because multimillion dollar attacks would be coming to those as well and they are much less well prepared to resist.
You can see it this way: During this year Bitcoin has resisted and even advanced against incredible forces trying to undermine cryptocurrency. It's not just defending itself, but it's defending also the ones behind it. Respect.

If unsure the best is buy in small parts the target amount you've decided, like a bit every week or every month (that's called cost averaging), this way if it goes up you already are in, if it goes down next time will be cheaper.
That said, never invest more than you can afford to lose, and also don't invest on something you don't understand.

Awesome, thnx for the info, had been looking for that pull request but only found [PR11177]( XD.
Still I believe since that's a big pull request with lots of changes atm just wallet.cpp part from 11177 can be the way to go for small services or everyone that already implemented segwit addresses using current rpc, but lacks segwit change...
Anyways will be reviewing and testing [PR11403]( to the best of my skills.

In the early days even you and me could mine on our laptops, hardly is it more decentralized now with one company almost having a monopoly on miner equipment and keeping most other miners by the balls... mining centralization is the one weakness left and hopefully capitalism will solve it bringing some competition otherwise we're royally f*c**d. If mining ends up being centralized, so.. the whole thing would have failed that's it.
About Gavin he never really understood bitcoin's adversarial conditions so well and doesn't have much in the way of cryptography or security (just see [how Gavin eat false proof by fake satoshi]( cmon one doesn't need to be Satoshi to know better, just have some basic notions of computer security). Thanks to people that care about bitcoin and it's ideals we have so far avoided a year of attacks and come out stronger and more technically sound. Sadly Gavin is not one of those persons.
About blockstream... cmon. About people in it, i'll just say [simplicity]( [confidential transactions]( [elements project]( Wrap your head around that and share the awesomeness with me :)... Think for yourself and contrast information and you will see we're going something incredible... if mining centralization doesn't kill us before.

It is being implemented by different teams of developers working on their own.
Typically it goes like this: first someone writes some paper about the idea, then it is discussed, then developers will go on implementing it on the different wallet softwares.

Chart price is weighted among different exchanges by volume so you are likely buying in a more expensive exchange.
Prices among exchanges differ because of difficulty to get money in or out of the exchange thus making arbitrage more or less difficult.
Also if more people is buying in one particular exchange the price on that exchange can be higher but will be correcting to level with other exchanges, except in extreme cases.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:07:16

Cmon, Bitcoin has always been free software... about the original developer (Satoshi) looks like he disapeared for "some reason". If you talk about Gavin, looks like he quit because he could not understand, nor produce, quality.
You can check and see who has been working on bitcoin:  to me it looks like there's more people contributing more recently... it's just standards have also gone up.
About centralization I mean if the whole network would be in the hands of a few miners, then external actors can control the network to censor transactions as an example. It's not about what miners can do, it's about what others can do to miners when they are just a few, same could happen to developers but know what, the code is out there and developers don't need much resources to work, miners need huge computing farms easily controllable. Miner centralization has already been a big problem (arguably bitcoin's biggest unsolved problem, since at least for scalability there are good plans), and increasing the odds in it's favour would not be a good idea while there are other, far better alternatives.
Is all of this a reason for trying to increase scalability in orders of magnitude while maintaining decentralization? Not really... that's called excellence, bitcoin could let go but then, another project would have to deliver on the original promise of an uncensorable, decentralized financial system.

Just make sure you use some legit software that runs locally on your computer and never use web paperwallet services that always risk getting your "paperwallet" stolen or generated in a weak way that can be stolen.
I would recommend to use [electrum]( and keep the seed in paper if that's what you want, just make sure you generate the wallet in a totally safe computer.

there is only one bitcoin, most other altcoins have forked from bitcoin by cloning their source code which is free, thus creating other (alternative) currencies, such as litecoin, decred etc.
bitcoin just implemented a number of improvements to unblock most of the historical problems from the protocol (difficult to scale, lack of privacy, confirmations take minutes...), but some scammers took the occassion to scam, and created another altcoin, but calling it "bitcoin cash" as well and having control of the bitcoin.com domain are trying to mislead people in a huge pump and dump scheme by hijacking the brand.

Any big selloff tied with any kind of FUD will trigger your fears, that's how it works, this year alone we have had these examples:
* Selloff because of FUD because segwit was delayed and fud about miners hard forking on their own
* Selloff also because of FUD with tech delay and "raise of alts" specially the ethereum flippening that never happened.
* Selloff tied to (fake) news from china
* Selloff tied to segwit2x attack cancellation and bch pump and dump
* Problably some other i'm forgetting about right now :P
If you want to hodl the best is just avoid the news altogether, because they will get you XD
Right now there are some narratives running like the scammy bch "operation dragonslayer", tether fud, brand fud, futures markets opening around 10 dec fud-nonfud.
Even apparently good or neutral news can serve to trigger panic when coupled with a good dump, like what happened when segwit2x attack was "cancelled".
About a full-on crash you never know what narrative could be used but seems like the situation is different from 2011 (mtgox) or 2013 (mtgox+china) but I can tell you in a real crash you likely wouldn't be thinking about selling in the first moment (denial) since then you would benefit from being able to buy the bitcoins cheaper later. In a small dump you will be slightly worried and then dump at the bottom thinking it might be a total crash.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:48:27
It is somehow expected since bitcoin this year implemented changes that will solve some of cryptocurrency historical weaknesses, this changes are already present in the protocol but still unrealized on user facing software (wallets).
Also, multi-million attacks trying to hijack the currency have been fended off (1 aug with UASF that got segwit activated) and lately when segwit2x attack was called off (and also failed due to software bugs anyway).
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:46:22

When you're sending bitcoin the wallet will send "change" to a new address, so to not risk losing any money you should backup the whole wallet.dat after any spends, or else be very careful about saving privkeys for all addresses holding funds (not just the ones where you received them).
To import private keys into bitcoin core you can use the [importprivkey]( rpc/cli command. (you can use it either from the console bitcoin-cli tool or from the debug console in the gui application). Other wallet softwares usually have some way to import or "sweep" a private key (like electrum has "sweep" that will send all your funds to a new address).
Note wallets in the old days where generating new addresses "from scratch", but nowadays there is a standard called [hd wallet]( aka "deterministic wallet" that will generate lots of addresses from just one code (the seed) that you can store and be sure your funds are backed up even if you send and coins go to change addresses and so on. This mode can be enabled in bitcoin core and is default in other wallet software like electrum.

Even if electricity will be free doesn't sound like a very good way since to even remotely hope to recover your investment into mining equipment you would want to run it 24x7.

4$ is not a low fee, but it's worth noting that migrating to segwit addresses makes fees lower since you can tap on the still mostly unused witness space.
still tricky though, since electrum just released segwit address support but to get backwards compatible addresses you need to initialize from a bip39 seed which itself is not producing... so it gets pretty technical.
atm biggest improvement can be made by service providers including the following patch on their bitcoin core nodes:  (the wallet.cpp without the flag switch is enough to get p2sh segwit change addresses)

The problem with electrum 3 is it's segwit support is using a new kind of address (bech32) that still is not supported in most services or even bitcoin core. Otherwise it's easy as before, just start it and select "segwit" on the initial screens but I wouldn't recommend it yet.
We now need bitcoin core to add support for sending to bech32 and also to send change to segwit addresses before this thing can fly. That's the main blocker.

Bitcoin is still where the whole team is: 
Really don't worry bitcoin has now included segwit which is a real upgrade that will move us past the historical weaknesses of the protocol, this will take some time to be implemented but imho currencies without segwit and thus unable to properly implement lightning channels and follow on bitcoin development are dead on the water.
We have also survived and come out stronger from two multi million dollar attacks and the future looks brighter than ever.
If anything a flippening would have to come from a radically new perspective like mimble wimble, but so far this will be implemented in bitcoin since the technology allowing that (segwit) is now in place.

For people that want to do something and some technical knowledge, there are two best ways I know of:

* Use bitcoin core and add the following pull request yourself:

We just need a bitcoin-core branch that has a simple segwit wallet implementation that can be used until core releases a final version that has this feature. IMO atm lots of transactions are not segwit simply because it's not even supported on the reference client's wallet, likely used by most big services.
(I know you have instead argued for better waiting for LN, and even better than just simple segwit wallet would be that it'd have also the necessary rpc for interacting with LN daemons in the branch... the btc1000x branch -one can dream-)

Bitcoin cash taking over is still not a factor, it's an obsolete currency before it was born, it's just getting pumped like many coins before it, but it's all just to get the true holders to let go of bitcoins. Don't eat the fud.

Yes you will first buy the bitcoins at any exchange like coinbase and then transfer to your own wallet, be it a hardware wallet or just something like electrum (you are recommended to use a hardware wallet if you don't know if your computer is secure).
Your bitcoins can be reasonably secure for some time on an exchange, only if enabling 2fa and any protections available (like with google authenticator), but you never know when the money will dissapear.
They will only be safe on your hardware wallet or a safe computer (ie: in your hands).

Bitcoin just implemented (back in august) a number of technological improvements directed at eliminating it's historical weaknesses (lack of privacy, lack of scalability, transactions take minutes...).
BCH is an attempt by [a number]( of [people]( to hijack the brand or at least damage its reputation while benefiting from pump and dump schemes.
They have been endlessly bashing the group of developers behind the core client, with weak technical arguments, like "we can solve this with 1GB blocks".
The truth is the developers are doing a great job, the best in the cryptocurrency space, and they are hugely respected by the community. They have kept incorruptible, all while pushing next-gen changes that will soon transform the whole of the cryptocurrency space (you can google for "lightning", "simplicity", "confidential transactions", "elements project").
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:38:46
on electrum you can go to settings and set it on "edit fees manually", then you get a text input instead of that slider where you can write whatever fee you want.
just be careful since you could be underpaying and taking long to confirm, but sometimes you don't mind so.. gives you the most control imo.

The problem with electrum is they've gone straight to the future, supporting only new addresses which are not backwards compatible with older software.
Let's hope they will address this in an upcoming release so segwit usage will go faster.
Otherwise, yes, there is a technical complicated way to get it working both with segwit and backwards compatible addresses.
As you see, wallet development is not really getting rushed, quality standards are being kept high as usual so things are taking some time... but we'll eventually get there.

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:07:03


It's not about miners being bad... they're supposed to work on their self-interest. the problem is about centralization.
if the system becomes centralized then we're back to trusted parties handling the transactions, to quote the white paper: 
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.   While the  system works  well enough for
most   transactions,   it   still   suffers   from   the   inherent   weaknesses   of   the   trust   based   model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid   mediating   disputes. "
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:23:30
Answering your other question, I believe if you just run Electrum 3.0 with your old wallet file you'll get your old non-segwit wallet.
If you want a segwit wallet you will need to create a new one, and select the "segwit" option on the wallet creation wizard, but that will be using the new bech32 format, that few other wallets can send to at this moment.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:31:11
I think hardware wallet is more for non-security minded people so they can keep the coins safe, you're right, since they won't depend on the computer that much, which would full full of viruses etc.
Security minded might trust more their computer than some random usb gadget designed for bitcoin users.
Anyways yeah, just explained from my pov i'm sure there are many more combos out there, like you can use electrum with multisig with hardware wallets so you can get best of both worlds.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:32:15
You should focus on the ones not implementing segwit since the fees will go down when everyone is using it more.
For wallet providers/services it's tricky because performing the fee estimate is tricky and they also can't risk getting transactions stuck for hours because then hotwallets become stuck without fresh inputs as well. Of course segwit implementation cuts the fees and as soon as it's possible lighting will hopefully offload a lot of weight from the blockchain.

Bitcoin is just getting developed, not waging any wars.. in any case the community has had to stick together against all these attacks, but really, now that we have segwit and a ton of technology in the pipeline the prospects are very bright.
Besides, probably all the drama is just some kind of huge market manipulation plus maybe some kind of trick to get rid of Roger who knows.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:40:58
Yeah that's what I think but I was talking more about a user supported effort to have a bleeding edge version while "endgame" 0.16 reaches our servers, if people want to risk it that seems more like the way than any kind of uasf that is, imo, useless in the current situation (would be to forcing people to jump on the bus, when the wheels haven't been fitted and there are no seats).

@_date: 2017-05-09 13:15:53
Ok thank for your response!
About bitcoin.com you can see for example the following as proof they exploit their domain name to push their own agenda:
Also, among their full node wallet recommendations they're still pushing for bu, xt, etc, even worse among their full node "featured wallet" feature: i keep refreshing the page but just get those, never get the true software running the bitcoin network: bitcoin core. you just need to check the front page today about bu nodes crashing time and time again. Can't see this as anything else than plain malicious behaviour for a site carrying one of the main bitcoin dns names.
About the links being old, I understand that's true for the blog post, but the other one seems to be a current endorsement. to me it detracts a lot from your offering knowing it will help Ver in getting more income. As a user (and companies) on the current scaling debate i can see few options but informing other users and boicotting companies endorsing bad players.
Again, thanks for your response, and hoping you will one day become truly neutral, then I can recommend your site.

I did read it, but I don't see how the network would grow since everything points to the network decentralization would suffer as well due to for example bigger and bigger blockchain and bigger and bigger blocks.
Also, an additional problem is hf is easier to exploit to further attack bitcoin.

The problem with UASF is it needs more than 50% miner support to be safe (or else close to 100% economic majority support, like exchanges, wallets, all of main bitcoin actors).
I wish we could UASF right now, but we really need either of those two to be true for it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:31:07
there is virtually no user support for hardforking if no real improvements to the protocol are implemented at the same time. sw+2mb is only good to create even more confusion  (classic, xt, bu, extblock, now sw+2m, yeah.) since it would require hf and long time to deploy without major issues. there is not even any code written for it yet.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:14:19
Yes sure, it's not bitmain who is keeping the network at ransom by exploiting miner centralization.

If they don't want just fucking all bitcoin users over, why don't activate segwit already and let the progress continue?
It's a no brainer really.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:51:49
the biggest obstacle is just miners not activating it already
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:00:10
Miners can still signal before, also with enough miner support there will be no split at all. I think it's in our hands to avoid any splits.

@_date: 2017-05-14 15:38:30
Well, once a majority of miners would be signalling it would be safer to consider a UASF option, so still important to get more miners on board.
Atm first step seems to be blocking asicboost since everyone seems on board with this and will clarify the discussion a bit.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:04:11
I think everyone would rather the miners activate segwit, but if bip148 is going to happen we shall better all stick together in this.
Waiting long is a dangerous game since we know miners are getting more and more funding with fees to play their games.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:11:15
miners seem to be enjoying high fees and pouring lots of money into stalling tactics.
they/we can have bigger blocks in 1 months if segwit is signalled for, and we will see what is needed for a future hf with more of a calm head, and scaling improvements from sw + 2nd layer already in place.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:03:10
Altcoins also have their role, but what you say is true, besides most altcoins fork bitcoin and merge to keep up to date.

Any stats you can look, and investigate a bit you will see it's just Jihan, Roger Ver and companies they have given money to (bought).

Internet connectivity can be a big factor, check this besides your cpu usage

triggering on soft fork with 95% is as good as it gets (it's the safest option when it's possible to do it). failing to do that, uasf is possible with a lower consensus percentage.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:19:24
Then UASF can be deactivated and join the merry segwit chain.
But truth is Silbert accord doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.
The "consensus" being just a handful of companies with a lot of big names missing (and most already where under the bitmain umbrella -bought-). Most of the ones who [voiced support for segwit]( are missing. Wallets developers not invited, big exchanges missing, bitcoin developers not invited.
Even the ones present in the consensus don't seem to make up their mind:
Silbert "Agreement" says: "Segwit ASAP and HF 2MB in 6 months"
Roger Ver says: "my understanding is that the two MB hard fork must come first"
Jihan says: "SegWit and HF will be locked-in at the same time at bit4"
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:21:15
bitcoin developers have created the most astonishing improvement to the network you could dream of (segwit), there's just the miners who need signalling it now. go miners! :)
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:16:44
It's a very good idea.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:52:53
uasf means "user activated soft fork", it means nodes will enforce activating of protocol improvements. the other way of doing the soft fork is masf, miner activated soft fork.
about uasf for segwit, which is the improvements to be activated, there are several schemes that have been proposed, the more relevant being bip148, bip149 and bip8. bip148 is the one getting more traction at the moment, and aims at activating in august. bip149 and bip8 would start the earliest in november.

he explained it, praising them because they not just coded the best possible solution you could think of to bitcoin problems, but in the face of powerful adversaries blocking development, they are still coding even more great solutions to us.
I personally am very thankful too, this is hero's we're talking about.
about the 2$ fee, they could be gone in 1 month if the miners signal. who benefits more from the high fees? ... the miners!
anyways they would benefit from the moon shot once segwit is activated.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:19:54
Also, to be fair, I like your blog post about the scaling debate and honestly on all light seems to imply you support segwit and conservative block size increase more than reckless block size increase. thanks for that!

@_date: 2017-05-06 01:59:55
about asicboost, you can just google it for a longer answer but in short its an efficiency improvement for mining that favours empty blocks and disfavours some bitcoin improvements that affect it, there is now work on fixing this in the protocol
about segwit, well we're waiting for some of the miners to activate it (specially bitmain). it's not clear why they don't activate yet since the benefits will be huge. one theory is they use asicboost so they don't want to activate it since segwit will disallow it as a side effect, but this is likely just a part of the picture.
the best we, the users can do, is read up on uasf alternatives and try to gently pressure miners as well as educate ppl about the benefits of segwit (there's a lot of misinformation aimed at newbs).

@_date: 2017-05-18 22:36:20
no, rbf (replace by fee) means you replace your transaction by another having a higher fee.
The trick is you need to enable rbf on your transaction beforehand (you can do it on clients like electrum), while you can always do cpfp.
rbf is more efficient since it doesn't need a second transaction, but I don't think you can do it if you didn't signal for it on your tx on the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:58:54
Not sure what they said a year ago, but they've been delaying segwit for months now, and it's the first step to see when bigger blocks are needed.
When they are the hard fork will likely come with beefier upgrades. I believe the miners are getting what they want unless you want to nit pick. They get segwit and bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:00:56
Well, it actually makes block bigger but by extending it with a new area the old nodes won't see, the "witness". Signatures go there and data that goes in this area is cheaper in the calculation for fees. To make use of this new area new style transactions are used, so the witness area will be more and more used as the network upgrades to benefit from lower fees and less congestion.
So, the non-witness area will be limited to 1 MB but there's up to 2.7 more MB, although for normal usage the size will be around 1.7-2.1MB.

@_date: 2017-05-14 01:42:02
big blocks can't happen without something like segwit because of quadratic signature verification, making bigger blocks dangerous for the network unless using some mechanism like segwit does.
this way it manages to make big blocks possible without risking "death blocks" that would take too long to verify thus ddosing the network.

@_date: 2017-05-25 00:07:08
They'd go with anything they can get as long as they can make it like bitcoin developers are on the other side, so they can have it run by their team. There is no hard fork crowd, there is just the bitmain crowd, and they want a hard fork so they can have their own bitcoin.

Hmm, doesn't seem too much of an argument to me (fear of an hypotetical possibility that would easily rally the community behind them if it was demonstrated to be true in the future).
From some of the published miner conversations, I think they imply a soft fork would be too costly to them, but why? Hey I know they just make statements to keep the thing going, without any real depth behind them.
Maybe first we should aim for blocking of asicboost at least will make things a bit clearer and seems to be a broad consensus for that.

Good manners and educative posts goes a long way anywhere.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:15:12
why is it not acceptable?
segwit is a very intelligent solution that avoids hard forking bitcoin while making a huge number of improvements to the bitcoin protocl.
this protects us from dividing bitcoin while upgrading, and also makes it safer while upgrading, all at the same time as bringing us:
* block size increase without quadratic signature checking increase
* confidential transactions
* lighting transactions
* safer upgrade path for the future
* possibility to implement schnorr signatures making unlimited multisig possible (addresses validated by 1000s of actors)
what's not to like, let's do it!
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:47:27

You can be sure ThomasV knows about the whole situation and knows what he's doing.
Think about it, if segwit gets activated, then what control does it bring the bitcoin developers? Yeah... they already have been coding it for long and bringing it to where it is.
If the situation continues to the point where miner centralization keeps progressing, who will control bitcoin?

Yes Jihan buying up the economic actors and piling up fees is pretty worrying...
Btw, besides signalling yourself perhaps most important is reaching out to economic nodes that might be not aware of the scaling issues and UASF.

1-I care about the fees specially when they go to the one keeping the network at ransom in the first place
2-Have you thought maybe it's users and developers fed up with the whole "do my bidding" stance from bitmain?
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:03:55
about the empty blocks, it can be either because of asicboost or simply because of other simplified mining method (some kind of efficiency gain)
antpool, owned by bitmain, one of the majority miners is sometimes mining empty blocks, but it's also not the only one.
bitcoin itself doesn't enforce filling of the blocks, it's just the miner is forfeiting fees that could be included in the block

That won't work if you're copying the address among different computers.
Using cameras and qrs can work but that have a lot more security minded auditing to be considered safe for bitcoin... a lot of the time you're better served by manual typing.

We need to reach everyone running nodes, and specially miners. Miner support will be critical.
About support, think a lot of bitcoin running companies don't read reddit or bitcointalk everyday, they might still have a very fuzzy idea about what's going on.

I don't see how you can avoid problems with DCS3, wouldn't it just deny blocks if any of the implementations fail to validate it?
DCS2 falls back to Europa, but what is DCS3 falling back to? libconsensus?

They have no base, while it's obvious jihan/bitmain is benefiting from the situation in several ways (aiscboost, high fees, miner centralization). It's not clear what Jihan's desired goal is, you can bet it's nothing good for the bitcoin we all know and love (he's either out to destroy or control bitcoin).
Miner centralization is a disgrace.

probably for long as they don't seem ethically motivated, but we should keep our manners

This is not only about economically significant actors, we need every wallet/service developer to voice support for uasf/segwit/bitcoin developers.
Also we need to figure out how we can get mining power, not only by getting existing miners/pools to support, but finding out how uasf supporters can buy/rent hashrate to power this.

you would just need a few of these:

If you've been for long into bitcoin you know segwit is best, comes from cypherpunks who think about adversarial conditions and always have defended our privacy and decentralization of the network. This is what sets bitcoin apart from other alts, it has highest standards in code review and protection.
Just look at who coded most of it:

Thanks again for your effort! It's definitely a step in the right direction, by providing some real (while simplified) analysis of the situation.
About the simulation, I'd like to see one where the transaction count grows exponentially, you have taken the linear trend from the last two years, but comparing to the years before, the trend has grown. A simulation accounting for this growth would show a better number of years for a worst case for all scenarios. Ie, make the tx/min² growth higher every two years for example.
While the simulations are simple and good to give some rough figures about hd usage, I agree with other posters here that jumping to conclusions about the proposals being safe'n'good should take into account network latency, throughput... you can check the following study to have an idea of other parameters: 
Also, about segwit max block being 3.7MB that might be a bit optimistic since to reach that size transaction building would have to be optimized to the maximum. Anyways, you're not taking into account other factors that can reduce usage in segwit case like LN or schnorr sigs, so maybe your assumptions, while simple, can be good enough so I just think a higher level of growth should be simulated as stated on the first paragraph in this comment.
Again, thanks for your effort and for providing the sources as well for other people to further your analysis.

Maybe write to them politely :)

segwit brings larger blocks and further scaling improvements.
we can have it in 1 month (by beginning of july) if the miners signal now, otherwise it will get activated by uasf around september (at least 1 month after uasf starts)

Child pays for parent. It means you send another transaction after the unconfirmed one with a higher fee, this way miners will want to pick up your second (child) transaction, confirming the first one too (parent).
It's one of the ways of bumping the fee of a transaction.

the problem is none of the dynamic group consensus schemes have been deemed safe for avoiding total control of the blockchain by the biggest/most powerful miners.

Hard fork are dangerous since they risk splitting the network. If you lose 10% of the network on every hf upgrade, think where we are after 5 upgrades.
Soft fork upgrade (backwards compatible) keeps all nodes on board and bitcoin strong. Even the nodes that "don't care" stay onboard. With a hard fork a percentage will always split, and any small amount of malicious acting can make this split bigger.

I still think it would be better to remove it alltogether or rephase as it looks spooky (We are happy to be associated with the following organizations) and easy enough to find by googling for "spendabit friends"
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:08:25
You can put it any way you want but it's up to the miners, they signal it, we get it in 1 month.
Developers have made a great job and the development process have been long enough to give time for everyone comment on it... also it's open source it's not like you can't also participate.
Blame? Blame it on the adversaries, and learn for the future. We all know current signal mechanism is done for, and maybe even pow, time will tell.

bitcoin is under attack because we're about to enter next level, don't despair, unite.

it'll come sooner or later
