Well, somebody had to mine the initial coins.   Keep in mind that as a first adopter, he would get a large sum very quickly/easily (this applies to any new crypto also).    However, anyone else involved early on would also quickly get a large sum.  So in essence, there wash't really a need to spread his coins around very early.  Later on, it is difficult to say ... many factors at play.     If you believe his intentions were altruistic, maybe he destroyed them.   Maybe something happened to him, before he had to chance to spread them in the later stages.

OK.  I wish I could do more to help remotely as well.  However, due to the capital controls / foreign currency exchange restrictions,  I now understand why the rate is so high.

Your question doesn't really make any sense, but I am going to go out on a limb and say no.

OK, here is my take on this.   Substitute Bitcoin for widgets, and include the case against Shrem.   If you facilitate the trade widgets for some monetary value,  knowing that they will be used for bad purposes, then you are going to be in trouble.   The only reason bitcoin is involved, is because bitcoin is a widget with value that was used in this scenario.   Is it a problem with Bitcoin?  No, not really.   This is from the Bitcoin Foundation's blog after the arrest of Charlie
"It is also worth noting that the indictment itself is not against Bitcoin or the community at large. Indeed, the complaint acknowledges, “Bitcoin are not inherently illegal and have known legitimate uses.”
In their press release, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara also states, “Truly innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”

Yes, Coinbase is solid.   Make sure you enable 2 factor authentication at a minimum from a security standpoint.   There are some additional security features/precautions you can take with Coinbase as well.   Most folks will tell you not to store your bitcoins online, but you need to be well versed in securing your own coins if you want to do better than Coinbase can provide.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:51:39
Not the same thing.   Protecting your source code is one thing, but one of the guiding principles of security is that "hiding secrets is hard".  What that means is that if you are relying on obscurity, you are doing it wrong.

As much as I love Andreas, I think he is sitting pretty well nowadays, with his investments and job security.   I am wondering if my bitcoin tips would be better spent in other ways.  I know he is an evangelist for many causes.  My preference at this point, would be for him to recommend other causes for me to tip my btc towards.   
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:21:16
Once a block is solved, it is pretty much known by everyone in real time.   You can choose to try to "re-solve" that block, but your resources would be better spent on solving the next block.  The reason is that you would have to be lucky enough to both re-solve the initial block AND solve the next block faster than everyone else could solve the next block to have a chance to get the dominant branch,  and everyone else already has a head start over you, because they are working off the 1st solved block before you have had a chance to "re-solve" it.  Does that make sense?
@_date: 2014-01-23 07:36:46
You are on the right track.   As a young investor, putting a small amount of your overall portfolio in a high risk area such as BTC is a sound/acceptable practice.  Coinbase has a recurring buy option also, if you want to automatically put a little bit of savings away of from any income.   There is some risk keeping your coins stored online with Coinbase, rather than holding them yourself, but once again, you need to really understand security and backup procedures if you are going to take that risk on yourself.

I know someone who bought at that price, but it wasn't their initial investment.

His webpage may be out of date.  I would prefer that he make a recent statement with regard to btc tips.  In other words, what causes he thinks we should tip to.  If he says tip me, as I give them away, then so be it.  However, he may make another suggestion.

Your concern is somewhat valid, but not an urgent issue with the current state of things.  It is a growing pain.   The workaround is to use a trusted lightweight wallet, like electrum, which doesn't need to download the full blockchain.   There are other lightweight wallets as well, but they all require offloading a bit of trust.

Something you know , and something you have.   The something you know is a password like any site, the something you have is a like a google authenticator app on your mobile device (sometimes referred to as a OTP, or one time password).   BTW, you should use 2FA for your banking site also, if you do online banking.

You cannot pay with Visa.   The reason is that BTC transactions are irreversible.    If you are in the US,  the best option is probably Coinbase, although some folks prefer localbitcoins.com.     Keep in mind that most of the friction and/or difficulty with buying bitcoin through the traditional banking system is caused by the traditional banking system itself, and not bitcoin.  In other words, bitcoin actually solves many of the problems with the traditional banking system.

In all seriousness, it may take more than a day to download the full blockchain with a qt client.   However, if you don't want the full blockchain, use a lightweight wallet.

Go with Coinbase, and don't worry about $70USD in fees.   You obviously believe that it will appreciate if you are investing, and $70 USD is small compared to $6K USD.  Keep in mind that this fee is potentially one-time and mostly due to the friction of the converting from legacy banking system / currency.   Going forward, you may not need to convert back, and spending BTC is practically frictionless.

Bearish opinions are healthy, and I am OK with that.   If I could offer some advice ... you could get your point across better with a smarter approach.  Instead of spewing FUD,  look at some of the posts in from the bears.

So localbitcoins in argentina looks to be ~10k pesos / btc.  10k pesos ~ 1250 USD.    So, buying 2 BTC in US, and selling there, would probably pay for a flight.   A few more could pay for a short vacation.   Anything wrong with my quick math?  I am not sure how I feel about this.   On one hand, I don't want to take advantage of the Argentinian people.   On the other hand, if this encourages people to travel there, and also helps out the locals with converting their savings, then maybe it is a win win for everyone.   I suppose if you can afford to travel from US to Argentina on your own (without BTC profits), then maybe you should sell some BTC for lower amounts?  However, that has its own complications as well.   I think there is some risk involved in being a foreigner selling on localbitcoins in Argentina.  You may need to pay for some personal security as well?

They are not simply a wallet.  They are a proprietary business.   Releasing their code would make them more vulnerable to attack.   You don't have to trust them.   I do trust them for purchasing, but I would never hold my coins in an online wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-31 06:16:25
OK, that makes more sense.  Why would you need to swap back though?  I wasn't looking for a net profit, but just to pay for the vacation itself.  I guess to recoup your flight price maybe?  Everything else you should be able to pay for with local currency.   My other worry would be getting fake bills on the black market.

I think I know where you are coming from.  Your 401k "high risk" options are relatively low risk for you.  If you want to invest in more high risk options that your 401k provider is not offering, take a 10% loan from your 401K and invest in BTC.   You will have to pay back your 401K loan gradually, but it may work out for you in the long run.   I would not recommend to loan out more than 10-20%.   Also, you need to have some discipline, in that your BTC investment is easily spendable.   If you take from your 401k,  don't treat the BTC as spendable income, but hold as an investment for long term.

Old hand me down laptop with wireless card removed, install Ubuntu, create armory offline wallet, 2 paper backups,  one in fire/water proof safe onsite, one offsite.  Instructions on how to recover to both my significant other and brother, in case I get hit by a bus.

OK,  I think I understand the misconception.   You are coming from the mindset of high frequency trading ... the closer my trading server is the to exchange server,  a half meter of fibre and/or nanoseconds make a difference.    That is not an issue.   Network latency has little / no effect.  Blocks are being solved with a frequency on average of every 10 minutes.   The network latency for a roundtrip from US to AUS is sub-second, so a totally different scale (i.e., not a factor).

Armory lets you split into cold/hot wallets on separate computers.   You create a tx with the hot wallet comp, sign it offline, and then broadcast it online.  If you watch the tutorial on their website, it is pretty easy.  The only possible risk I see is transferring a "dirty" usb drive to the offline computer, but my online wallet computer is Ubuntu also, so hopefully safe from most usb viruses.
Edit: "hot wallet" may be the wrong term b/c there are no coins stored there.  Armory lets you split into online/offline wallets

based on your response, I think there still may be a bit of confusion.   Open source has its place ... Bitcoin code itself, an android wallet, etc.   Coinbase is something different entirely.  Your trust in them should be analogous to trusting any business with your money.  For example, an exchange or a poker site.   Of course, don't do business with someone you don't trust.  Coinbase has built trust because they have been around for awhile, many people have used them with no issues, etc.

Thanks, sorry if my initial post was misunderstood.  I am definitely not interested in profit making.   I still have some conflicting thoughts though from an ethics standpoint.   Let me rephrase the thought experiment.   If I were to do this trip as suggested (swap BTC bought in US and sold in Argentina),  would that ultimately help out the locals by providing them an avenue to convert their devaluing pesos to BTC?   Is there anything I a missing?   I am not just looking for a free trip.  I want to help people.
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:53:23
I am just trying to help you out.   If you want to be taken more seriously, then you need to express your thoughts in a different manner.   Otherwise, everyone will consider you a troll.    However, based on your disposition, I am inclined to believe that you really have no interest in an open/honest debate.

Protecting your source code is not "security by obscurity".   From the wikipedia entry "Security through obscurity has never achieved engineering acceptance as an approach to securing a system, as it contradicts the principle of simplicity. The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specifically recommends against security through obscurity in more than one document. Quoting from one, "System security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components."[1]
It is analogous to a homeowner leaving the rear door open, because it cannot be seen by a would-be burglar."
