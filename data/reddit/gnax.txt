Your net worth

Yes, obviously, since the price went down?
@_date: 2018-09-04 13:34:47
What? It’s exactly the opposite. A 10% drop at +2000% is a 20 times bigger deal...

Do you understand in what thread you’re posting in? OP is implying that gov can’t have an impact on your bitcoin investment. Clearly they can as history has shown us.

No, I have no such expectations. Why do you ask?

I think you are confusing investing with saving money. Investing is a risk, you’re risking losing all of your money. There is a reason you have to agree that you understand you can lose all of your money before you are allowed to buy a stock on the stock exchange for example.

They would not swap because he has less time left to live. No money will change that. You can’t buy time. Most people would rather live poor than spend most of their life with excel sheets and news updates. It’s a different thing if you actually enjoy investing like you and me.

Exactly my point. Most people don’t know how to invest wisely. So the best they can do is to not participate unless they want to dedicate a big part of their life learning about investing in which case they lose out on something that is more valuable to them than money (time).
Nobody in their 20’s would want to swap places with warren buffett.

No, that is because most people are average. You have to be the best to be the best, whether that’s investing or starting your own company or something else. A bad investor can’t just invest all their money and expect to be sucessful.

Yeah, if the fed print 600 trillion USD it will be worth that.
