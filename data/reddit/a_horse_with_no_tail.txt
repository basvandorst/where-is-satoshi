reminds me a lot of the current e-cigarette regulation battle.

I *think* I saw a thread the other day where Dwolla cancelled someone's account for using bitcoin.

Well, I know it was possible to get in and get your coins yesterday if you hit it at the right time, but his wording about being charged on Monday made me think he didn't.

Why doesn't he want his identity discovered?  I've always wondered that. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:46:57
yeah, but since he said coinbase wouldn't be *charging* him until Monday, I'm inclined to think he bought during one of the delayed times.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:35:57
it should, but it's probably better to do a weekly transaction to save on fees.

Normally when you buy from Coinbase, you get the amount of coins you bought, for the current price. It'll show up in like 4 days and even if the price has gone up by $500, you get the price from the day you bought.
Since you bought when Coinbase was out of coins, they won't process your buy until Monday and you'll get the Monday price. So, $531 worth of coins at Monday's price, which could be either higher or lower than it is now.

Would love to, but they don't seem to be accepting usa people.

Coinbase will still get their .1 and the bank will still get their .15, before you get anything. So yeah, I'd say it will go through.

The delay is not happening anymore for new orders. You can buy from coinbase right now and lock in the price that shows right now. If you bought yesterday during the delay, they won't charge you till Friday (or Monday, depending), and you'll get Friday's rate. I *assume* that when they make the purchase for you on Friday, you will then get the normal 4ish day delay until you actually recieve your coins, but you're then locked in at Friday's rate.

I don't know anything about cancelling, sorry.

no, he bought yesterday, which should mean that he bought when Coinbase was out of coins. During that period, people who bought had to check a box that agreed they'd get the monday price instead.

The coinbase stuff looks correct. It's a 4-day delay for me with the money being taken out pretty much immediately, and I don't get any notification that the coins are there. Of course this all goes out the window when coinbase is out of coins, as they were yesterday.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:48:29
true, I probably wasn't clear with my assumption.
