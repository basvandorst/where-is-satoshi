Gizmodo just picked up on it. The more this spreads, the better!

LOL ok there BCash cowboy. At least make your insult somewhat believable. Maybe start with the slow transaction times right now? There you go. That's a much better argument for you.

Ok, just used it. IF this is how Lightning transactions will work in a production environment, we should be pumping pure Oxygen and Meth into every office of every Core Dev out there SO THEY GET THIS GOING NOW. That was entirely too fast. NICE.

I'd say the minimum is at least the cost of a Trezor or Ledger. I'm no mathematician though.

This is how the US Tax code works. I have no issue with it. You pay capital gains. Taxes are what keep this country moving.

I was careful about this in my initial borrow. It was only 6% of my total 401k portfolio, and the loan is satisfied in 5 years. My brain tells me that in a worst case scenario, I lose out on those compounding gains in the 401k on the loan amount (initially) but that is slowly fed back into my portfolio with my monthly loan payments, so I'm never going to miss all 8% of my portfolio getting earnings since I'm reinvesting into it with every payment (minus the 5.25% APR). With what I've made in just the last 3 months in BTC I could pay the loan off and still have 15K left over as profit (which is already insane to me), but I really want to ride this out for the long haul. It would be crazy to see what BTC is at in 20+ years when I can actually cash my 401K out and have mt BTC as additional income.

Preach on. I picked mine up almost 2 years ago and I actually welcomed the fallout. I went from checking damn near every hour for 2 months when it spiked to 20K. to maybe once a month at this point. Only came here today because all the tech blogs I look at have some article about how Bitcoin is back  yada-yada-yada. Maybe when I retire I'll see if this is still a thing. Kind of like a "barn find" moment when I'm old and gray.

I'll actually shit out a bull if that happens

Went ahead and bought .75  and will wait until Friday to spend the rest. I just want to get it all invested and let it ride.

BCwut? I don't think you meant to use that 3 letter term with the $8,000 level you typed.

I would normally agree just looking at the past trending, but BTC has finally broken through to the massive social marketing audiences along with major corporations and major financial sector players. It is being adopted/purchased at such greater numbers now that although I can see a correction, I can't fathom it having the kind of bottom line from 2+ years ago. The word isn't out on the street anymore. The word is out on the World.

I took the gamble by borrowing against my 401k at 5.25% over 5 years back in early August. I'm up over 100% so right now I AM ARVIND lol.

Would you go so far as to say "in 2 weeks"?

At least they'll run out of catchy names to lure people in. I mean, Bronze already? Remind me in 1 year when "Bitcoin Foil" is Forked. Screw these people.
