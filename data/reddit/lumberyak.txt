I highly doubt the US will invade. I believe any military action would be the spark that ignites the power keg. Trump can't even get his wall built. He isn't going to have support for any foreign invasions

Where do I even start with you? There are no homeless people in rural areas because rural areas provide few/no services for the homeless. It's much easier to be homeless in a city. Your fear mongering won't work on me, so take it someplace else. Blue states are bankrupt? Then why the hell are blue states subsidizing red states? Let each state bootstrap itself. I thought Republicans believed in self-reliance.

So you're complaining about a carbon tax that should have been higher a long time ago and will benefit the planet, a sugar tax that should have been higher a long time ago and will benefit the general health of the population. And a luxury tax on a good that you can easily live without if you hate the tax that much?
Find your bootstraps and pull yourself up. You sound entitled as hell.

Red states also like to act like big toughies, you went to war against the blue states once and got absolutely wrecked. So maybe drop the cowboy routine. You act like your crops are absolutely vital. You grow shit like soy and corn man. California grows the produce that we actually eat. Washington produces enough wheat. You know who else grows what? Fucking everybody. Wheat grows anywhere. What the actual fuck would a red state do without access to the banking industry? The tech sector? Industry and manufacturing? Bud rural america has been dying for 80 years. You absolutely needs the dems more than the dems need you.

You mean like every red state and rural area receiving more in federal tax dollars than they pay?

You're a grade A moron is what you are. You honestly think anybody here believes you are a random crypto millionaire and give a shit about a soda tax? And you are staying put in rural Illinois? You're so obviously full of shit.

I understand why agriculture gets subsidized. Red states would not survive without blue money though. That's asinine. Where do you think they sell their produce? Most blue states also have enough land to grow their own food. Red states are the weights on the ankles of the nation man. 
And before you think I'm some heartless snob, I fully support supporting my fellow countrymen and I am happy that we subsidize agriculture. I'm tired of offering a helping hand only to get spit on and told what an asshole I am - after they have taken the help.
