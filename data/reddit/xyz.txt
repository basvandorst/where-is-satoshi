BFX hit $0.18 and 0.45ish. It's been at 0.3 pretty consistently today. (1-0.3) * 36% = 25% loss. must have sold just above 0.4 to consider it 20%. (unless of course, he means he sold at 0.2 lol).

China did not 'ban bitcoin'. Stop it. Why is this upvoted? 
A number of Chinese banks on the non-public guidance of the People's Bank of China are suspending exchange accounts which allow the deposit of onshore RMB into the exchange. I'll copy and paste what I wrote because this is getting really frustrating, combating misinformation...
To understand the complexity of the situation, everyone should read this statement by Huobi regarding the latest account suspensions:


Not everything is black and white, 'banned'/not banned, allowed / not allowed to deposit. People are blaming China for misinformation and manipulation, but the current information is out there if you take a moment to wade through all of the ridiculous comments and headlines. The fact that people were debating in no uncertain terms whether btc would be "banned", as in completely not allowed to be used, just goes to show you the state of information and comprehension around these parts.
...and yes, back to the article at hand, exchanges will continue to find work-arounds. The panic and negativity lately is disturbing.

I doubt it'll catch on right away. Rather, it's the exposure that makes it easier to get into further down the line. I was exposed to bitcoin in April of last year, didn't do much with it, didn't even know there was a bubble. November came around and I've since invested 10k in hardware. Had I not been exposed earlier, I would have just looked at it cursory as I did it April.

It's not a mind change or a dump or a mass buy, it's manipulation.

Ha, no *contradiction there. Indeed 'you being controlled' referred to the husband. It doesn't require the inverse however. If the man is too controlling, there's an issue, like you implied with the tone of your example. No. A husband leading a relationship would allow him to say 'hey, make me a sandwich I'm hungry' and the wife would be happy about it. She does things to make him happy of her own volition, he likes her for it and wants to keep her around, she's happy he's happy, and everything is roses. If a wife isn't willing to make a sandwich for their partner, there's an issue.
And there you have it. Healthy relationships explained via sandwich.

The rationale is that people who lost a great deal were idiotic in not doing more research. When investing such large sums, it should be a responsibility to do the research which would have led to the obvious choice (avoiding/ejecting from gox). If such research wasn't done, the thought is that there was very little care for the money invested, and they *deserve* the fruits of such frivolity. For all the people who had been in gox, did that research, and then genuinely struggled, there is much sympathy.

The comments in here are absolutely terrible. All so negative. Bitcoin isn't socialism. The '1%' could completely take over bitcoin. This is part of growing up. We see people with significant fiat start to care and they could hold a significant portion of BTC. Now, there is an establishment of rules for companies of a new type to operate... A business has to follow guidelines for operation. You didn't think this would happen? This is good news. This is big news. This is bitcoin fitting in, finding its place, and working its way in *actual* society.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:32:07
They clearly stated that bitcoin isn't 'banned' and, at present, we can deduce that *some* banks aren't comfortable with BTC, likely because of non-public guidance given to them by the PBOC. To quote Huobi from the other day:

I was originally for the idea. Now I'm not. People *don't* think you can only buy one bitcoin, or if they do, they abandon that idea pretty quickly. Because, you know, we all learned about division and decimal places when we were children.
Bits is seemingly arbitrary and, with the varying price who knows how it'll look in a year from now; atm there are too many digits for it to look pretty--something that we were going for to make it more palatable.

For an example of something that didn't fit in, see: the electric car. That would have shaken things up, but the big players didn't let it in. Bitcoin is being let in. Again, this is good news.

OP, serious question, are you...a child? The fluctuations of the dollar/bitcoin charts look the same as any major currency: euro, yuan, etc. Bitcoin is the volatile entity here. It is the dominating variable. There is a long term decline in the USD, but it's *long*, so long that it's negligible when comparing it to BTC. Therefore, USD is *relatively* stable.

Here's [xiefeilaga]( personal translation:
Announcement on the Temporary Cessation of Deposits via ICBC Cards on Huobi
Dear Huobi users:
Latest news from Huobi:
At roughly 10:00am today, we received notice from the Zhongguancun Branch of ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank) that they had been notified by operations management to cease providing service to Huobi, and would be closing Huobi's ICBC account by April 18.
At roughly 10:30, several of the Huobi partners rushed to the Zhongguancun Branch of Huobi to communicate with the Customer Manager.
The situation is as follows:
1. They did truly receive notice from higher up at the bank, requesting a halt to our ICBC Zhongguancun Account, effective April 18
2. The notice was an oral notice. The branch has not received anything in writing
3. When asked why other banks had not sent out the same notice, the response was that different banks may be interpreting policies in different ways, and may have different levels of sensitivity
4. When asked if there was any room for maneuvering, the answer was that there was none. The order had come from above, and there was nothing to discuss
5. When asked how to handle user funds in the future, the answer was that we could shift our funds to a different commercial bank, but not ICBC.
We asked the Customer Manager to provide his views on the Bitcoin policy and related matters, but since they did not represent ICBC's views, and had little direct bearing on Huobi's operations, they will not be explained point-by-point in this notice.
Today at 12:00, we rushed back to the office to release this notice. Before release of this notice, we did not notify any users or organizations in advance. Please keep an eye on this.
Huobi will officially suspend deposits through its ICBC Zhongguancun Branch account next Monday (April 14)(this will not affect users withdrawing cash from ICBC. **We will use accounts at other banks to transfer the funds to your account). At present, this does not affect other banks.** Huobi will release any new information immediately.

@_date: 2014-07-15 06:35:33
Yes, correct. This is why I'm bullish on BTC. But we were assessing risk. Assessing worst case scenarios, given two options: USD collapse vs BTC collapse, the demise of BTC is more likely in this lifetime. And, because of the lack of adoption / resultant volatility, the height it falls from would be higher.
It's safe to leave your money in USD and watch it decline over the years as a result of inflation. It's safe. It's not risky. You'll still have a significant portion of it. BTC is uncharted and volatile. I'm willing to take that risk. But not understanding the risk is folly.

....Circuit City. Best Buy struggling. Hard. It's "an Amazon showroom." That's why we price matched. I'm a former bby employee, all in on bitcoin, but as a former salesman, I understand demographics. Brick &amp; mortar does not meet well with digital. Digital is the future. Digital is now.

You expect far too much from them.

You just pulled that out of your ass, no? Because, they actually said they were undecided on publicly announcing the results.

First off, China did not 'ban bitcoin'. People are spreading misinformation out of ignorance or maliciousness and people who're hoping BTC fails for a cheap laugh or to make themselves feel better are propagating ~~bull~~bearshit.
A number of Chinese banks on the non-public guidance of the People's Bank of China are suspending exchange accounts which allow the deposit of onshore RMB into the exchange. I'll copy and paste what I wrote because this is getting really frustrating, combating misinformation...
To understand the complexity of the situation, everyone should read this statement by Huobi regarding the latest account suspensions:


Not everything is black and white, 'banned'/not banned, allowed / not allowed to deposit. People are blaming China for misinformation and manipulation, but the current information is out there if you take a moment to wade through all of the ridiculous comments and headlines. The fact that people were debating in no uncertain terms whether btc would be "banned", as in completely not allowed to be used, just goes to show you the state of information and comprehension around these parts.
...and yes, back to the article at hand, exchanges will continue to find work-arounds. The panic and negativity lately is disturbing.

If you're American (Read:USA), there's very little knowledge of 'the outside world'. You would have been better off citing a foreign market (which, is a more apropos analogy to bitcoin).

"CONFIRMED" -- such sensationalism
Can we get a sensible translation please? What exactly are they doing at 0:00 on the 15th? What's still available and what's not?
What did they say about what they're going to do in the future, because they seem to end on a positive note, but I can't make sense of it.

Like it's mentioned in every time people think this is clever (to cover up 'In God We Trust'), this isn't a positive thing to do. You're not thinking about the public as a whole and would fail a course in marketing. You're like teenagers sticking your skateboard stickers everywhere. Get off my lawn.
I'm into bitcoin and this makes me cringe. Now imagine what people who have little idea of it will think. They're already likely biased negatively toward something new like this or developed that view based off of the media. Now it's in their face, courtesy of immature teenagers and activists. That's the perception given off.

Bitcorn's ideas about volatility are ridiculous. It's good to see our representatives seem to get it and understand statistical variance.

Not a choice, just valid mathematical notation.

I'll only comment on the latter... What's your point? 50 Cent is a great example of entrepreneurial success regardless of his fame. See: *50 Laws of Power*
Btw, from the article that you didn't read:

There actually was a Chinese alt (amusingly) called Junkcoin.

LOL, apparently &lt;5% of a drop is now considered 'tanking' for BTC.

At present, the bitcoin economy in its infancy isn't practically suited for everyday basic buying and spending. The common idea is to buy more/replenish the funds after a purchase, but, that's not sensible relative to just handing over a debit card. There's no practical reason to add in a middle man. Add in the fact that a middle man would include fees and you're subject to volatility, and you could easily end up paying more with a process less practical.
There's only two reasons to often spend BTC on everyday things:
Incentive: Sufficient discounts for using BTC that make up for the additional fees and volatility
Idealist vision: Using BTC at the grassroots level to help spread BTC use, knowledge, and adoption. This vision is valued more importantly than cost of fees and hassle.

can you explain this strikethrough?
