The price *has* always been relatively volatile, but there is a huge difference between boping up and down a few bucks or so over a 5 month time period, and the ridiculous swings of 10's and even hundreds of dollars we have been seeing over the last couple weeks.  If you go back and look at the monthly charts from last year, the price hovers around $4-$6 for the first half of the year, before slowly rising to around $13 by the end of the year.  Yes, by percentage that is a pretty big swing.  But it did not happen over a few weeks, and again, there is a huge difference between going from $4 to $12, and going from $40 to $250.  I could do something similar to what you've shown and demonstrate [remarkable stability](
So, discounting the bubble in mid 2001, it took nearly two and a half years to hit $20.  From there, it only took a couple months to hit $40.  And from there a bit over a month to hit $250.  In the few weeks since we've seen a drop to $50, back to $150, back to $70, back to $100...That's quite a bit more volatile than bouncing up or down a couple bucks or so, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:58:28


Has inflation negatively impacted your life somehow?  Has it been so awful that the money you have in the bank becomes worthless over a short period of time?  Does it really concern you *that much?*


I'm curious as to where you live that you believe your wealth is at risk of seizure by any means other than taxation.


You're taxed on the money you have in your savings account?  Or cash you have in your wallet?


I don't really understand what you're trying to say here.


I'm guessing the shift is *extremely* gradual, since bitcoins are nearly useless in one's day to day life.

What's your point?  You can deal with fractions of a cent as well.  We're not talking denominations.  We're talking the minimum value of a Bitcoin in today's dollars if it were to become a world currency.  Or even were to take over for the dollar.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:49:02
Of course I see benefits.  If I didn't I wouldn't have bought coins in the past.  But it is not a tangible product.  Apple was successful because it produced revolutionary products that people around the world wanted.  The ipod allowed people to take their entire music collections with them, in a unique and stylish player.  The iphone was arguably the most important personal  electronic device of the century, completely changing the mobile world and kickstarting mainstream usage of smartphones.  BitCoins are difficult for your average person to get, if they even know about them.  You can't use them as you would a tangible product, or physical fiat currency.  And you aren't going on Amazon to buy shit with BitCoins any time soon.  
The value of BitCoins is going to come back down to Earth, and this bubble is probably the worst possible thing that could happen to it.  Once the price starts to plunge, more and more people are going to bail, and confidence in the currency will disappear.  It could become a joke to those who don't use them.  Similar to dot.com companies like e.Digital.  I'm hoping it doesn't completely implode, because I like what it offers *me*.  Unfortunately, what I use them for has no use to the average person.  Which is why it's about to come crashing down.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:55:52
Not when exchange rates were over $200 and incredible attention was being heaped on the currency. So many people are trying to hop on the train, and if the newcomers were told that the system could be gamed to easily drop the value by over half, do you think they would stick around and give Mt the ridiculous transactions they've been seeing?

At least you're honest.  And, despite what the circlejerk here would have you believe, you're most likely the epitome of the new buyers into BitCoins.  I've used them for a couple years, and bought a bunch when they were at $4.  I sold off the coins I had at $163.  I'd have been stupid not to, with everyone throwing their money at it trying to make a quick buck.  Now I'm just hoping it doesn't hit the floor so I can buy back in when the hysteria has passed and go on as usual.

Why the hell would this post be downvoted?  This is a legitimate concern,especially considering how the bitcoin community is trying to pump the currency as a world-beater and superior to fiat.  The perfect cash alternative.  These details are not trivial, and when people learn about them, as OP just has, they are not going to be happy.  Hell, I'm not happy with a transaction fee period, but at least I'm aware of them.
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:40:58
The plateau has lasted a bit longer than I thought.  I had a good time with the $50-$90 fluctuations of the past week or so, but I expected it to drop much more than it has.   Someone(s) has really been manipulating the price, so it's tough to figure out where the price is going to go.  I still see it eventually settling around $30 or so, but with artificial manipulation of the market it's really hard to tell.  Good thing my last buy was at $72 huh?  I'll give this level a couple days at most, but obviously don't quote me on that. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:53:16

And then drop to 90, then back to 140, then to 70, then...
Point being bitcoins are not going to supplant banks for those who want to save.  Nor should they.




I don't think you understand the point of my comment.  We're not talking about trading.  We're talking about banks being afraid of BTC.  Speculating on bitcoins is not something that the banks give a shit about.  The only business they're losing out on in that case is money that could be put into a savings account instead.  That's akin to saying banks are scared of casinos because it takes away money that could be in savings accounts.

Whoa, cool your jets bud.  Who said anything about laws *eliminating* illegal behavior?  You said the result of legalizing DWI would simply be "stupid people who drive unsafe vehicles" being "removed from our society".  And you didn't see the negative.  I reminded you that, along with those drivers possibly killing themselves, they'd be taking a lot of others with them.  


Go ahead and posit whatever you want.  The truth is that since the early 80's, with an increased emphasis on curbing drinking and driving, [the percentage of drivers involved in fatal car crashes under the influence of alcohol has dropped dramatically.](  It would seen that stricter law enforcement is having an affect, wouldn't you say?


I wouldn't say they would jump at the chance, but you're being obtuse if you're trying to believe that the threat of a DUI isn't a deterrent to driving while intoxicated.

Both were bought and sold to make a quick buck.  It doesn't matter that they are entirely different.  The trading values within the bubble and including the crash, are subject to the same market forces and will most likely suffer the same fates.

The largest exchange basically shut its doors because the price fell too far.  Although they didn't have a problem saying the price rose too high too fast.  I'm sure that'll instill a lot of confidence in the market.  At least those who have their coins tied up there won't be fucked by panicking and selling off, since they're pretty much stuck.

Oh, I wholeheartedly agree.  However, if somehow someone were able to break into my home and rape my wife...hell, let's say rape, torture and murder my wife, I'd love to have that person held accountable for that.  Seeing as how I'm only one man, it would be very hard for me to track down and find this man and bring him to justice.  I'd probably hire people to help me do it.  I'd have to call them something, so I'd nickname them the Police.  Hopefully these people would track down the person who, apparently legally, raped, tortured, and murdered my wife.  I'd want that person to pay, and pay *dearly* for what he did.  But I'd want to make sure that it was the right person.  After all, I wouldn't want to kill an innocent person by mistake, letting the realy asshole off.  So I'd make sure in this police group there were smart people looking for evidence.  I'd call them Investigators.  And after they had accumulated enough evidence against the man they caught, I'd want him to pay.  Although, in my fucked up state I may not be the best judge of the evidence, so I might grab some people, let's call them Peers, and present the evidence to them in something I'd call a trial.
You know...that thought experiment really has me thinking.  Maybe I'll get a group of people together and, instead of having everything be legal, we can make certain guidelines of behavior we'll call Laws.  Whenever these Laws are broken, I can have the Police arrest the person who broke them, and we can follow the above thought experiment.  It's so crazy it might even work!  We could call it SOCIETY!

Why is it not likely?  This is a bubble, and it is bursting.  That's what bubbles *do*.  The fact that the price went so ridiculously high this time could make the fall that much worse.  People are not losing hundreds of dollars.  They're losing thousands, and even tens of thousands.  Do you really think those people are going to come back and give it another try?  Or that a bunch of people will buy in so prepare for the next ride?  Credibility for the currency is disappearing, and it will get an even worse reputation once the mainstream media highlights the fact that over a billion dollars were basically obliterated in the crash.
I was hoping for a gradual increase in value and adoption of BitCoins.  Instead we got this.  In the short-term I don't want to complain because I made a good bit of money off it by selling high.  But in the long run, it's going to be a very big blow to the currency.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:44:48
Yep.  There are no fees involved whatsoever with Bitcoins.  None.  Nadal.  You want $100 in coins?  You just use $100 to buy that $100 in coins.

@_date: 2013-04-11 17:04:27
We should not be looking at BitCoins as an "investment" which will make you dollars.  It is meant to be a currency or anonymous store of fiat to protect it and move it anonymously.  "Investors" are driving the volatility, not the value or usefulness of the coins themselves.  People are like you.  Buying them to sell them later.  You *are* going to see them come floating down to earth after a few more crashes.  It will probably rebound to $100, maybe a bit higher, for a bit, then will crash again before gently floating down to around $15-$20.  At least I hope that's what happens, instead of the currency dropping to the floor.
There is a use in BitCoins, so their value will most likely never go to zero.  But this bubble has cost people thousands and even tens of thousands of dollars.  Over a billion dollars washed away like that.  The amount of credibility that is going to be lost over this bubble will dwarf the last one, and you're fooling yourself if you think people are going to come back and risk getting severely burned again.  And when the mainstream media shines a spotlight on the enormous loss of money people have suffered, how many new people do you think are going to jump in to start buying them?
If you only have $100 to invest, put it into stocks or an IRA.  It's clear that the $100 means a lot to you, so you're obviously not eager to lose it.  So don't.

People are free to invest in whatever they want.  If you want to make money through currency exchanges, go for it.  The value is set by a central authority, the issuing government, and my dollar won't be worth dick if someone makes a ton of cash using it to buy Euros.  As of right now, BitCoins are simply an alternative way of moving funds.  They are a place-holder for fiat money.

Come on.  I know nobody wants to hear this, but *bitcoin isn't scaring anyone*.  It is a storage vehicle for fiat, used by a ridiculously small number of people.  What competition is it presenting to the banks?  Seriously, what?  Bitcoins may become a viable alternative to banks when it comes to storing small amounts of money for the short term, but anyone who would drop their savings into it instead of investing in the stock market or having a savings account at a bank/cc is extremely irresponsible.  Imagine buying into bitcoins during the peak and then watching your nest egg lose 60% of its value overnight.  
I got into bitcoins a year ago for specific purposes, and held on to some as pure speculation, and it's worked out pretty well for me.  I still keep some fiat in coins because there are uses for it.  It's money that I can play with, so I don't consider it a loss if the value drops.  I wouldn't hesitate to sell either though if the price rose high enough again.
I am in no way defending banks here.  And bitcoin may some day rival the PayPals of the world.  But as it stands, I don't see it being used solely as a currency.  Just a vehicle to store and move fiat.  If I'm wrong, well great.  That would be fantastic, and my store of coins could really become valuable.  But let's not fool ourselves into thinking anyone is afraid of bitcoins.

Well shit, why didn't I think of that?!?  I'll just buy more bitcoins using *bitcoins*!  That way I don't have to use fiat currency to purchase them, and can avoid any fees, right?  Awesome idea!

Shhhhhhhh! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:05:06
No prob.

That is true if the merchant holds onto the coins for an extended period of time, and doesn't immediately exchange for fiat, which I'm sure was almost definitely not the case.

No, the *poit* of the comic is that the broker the man is talking to is advising him agains investing in Bitcoins because if he did, the broker wouldn't be able to charge him fees.  *My* point is that those fees are just transferred to other middlemen between your dollars and the Bitcoins you want to purchase.

It doesn't matter what you think.  It is what everyone else thinks.  And as soon as the bubble pops (it will), we can go back to using them, hoping that it will continue to catch on, but gain more stability.  In the meantime, I sold my 6 coins I bought at around $4 at $163.  Absolutely stupid not to.  I''ll wait for the hype and chaos to subside before jumping back in and using them as I was before.

Dude, you don't even know me.  Because I'm not jumping into the moronic "Bitcoins will be the new world currency" circlejerk does not mean I know nothing about them.  I've used Bitcoins for a couple of years now, and until a few days ago always held a couple in my wallet.  It is going to stay what it always has been.  A store for fiat which allows anonymous exchange or transfer of funds, and a hedge against individual collapse.

Why is that a *good* thing?  The current price of coins is due *soley* to speculators. And that price is the *only* reason bitcoin is receiving media coverage.  How anyone can think speculators bringing value to bitcoin is bad is beyond me.

When the media decides to simply report that overnight billions of dollars were lost over a digital currency who's main use is in purchasing illegal drugs and services on the silk road, they won't have to do the crucifying.  The public will do it for them.

You really think a Bitcoin will effectively be worth, at a minimum, $3.1 million in today's dollars?  Really?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:04:01
Until it is possible for me to use exchange my dollars for bitcoin without having to through an intermediary, it doesn't matter whether it's on the side of fiat or Bitcoins.  It is a fee I must pay. To pretend otherwise is ridiculous.

Except that right now the currency is being traded as if it *were* a company.  People are looking to get rich, jumping in as the "stock" skyrockets.  e.Digital was part of the dot-com bubble, and it's stock shot through the roof on rumors that it was going to be listed on NASDAQ.  It wasn't, and the priced is now around 8 cents.  The speculation driving the BitCoin bubble is as a hedge against fiat currencies.  The fact that you can spend your coins pretty much nowhere is going to drive many speculators away, selling off their coins for "real" money they can actually use.
This isn't a condemnation of BitCoins, but a warning that this has happened in the past.  The similarities between the charts is amazing.  Except for the speed of the rise.  With BitCoins, we're not talking months for the explosion, but weeks, and even days.  Many people are trying to buy them to make dollars.  I thank them, as I sold off my 6 coins when it hit $163.  Having bought a bunch at $4, I was using them for things other than an investment.  I'll gladly take the money, and will wait for the pop before buying more and continuing business as usual.

[So do these two.](  The question is whether [they will continue to resemble each other in the future.](

Because fuck investing. IRA's are boring.  The real money is I unknown "currency"  futures. Haven't you been paying attention?  Buy buy buy,  sell sell sell.  It all makes sense when you don't know what the hell you're talking about.

No.  It was designed to be an alternative currency to rival and/or replace fiat.  Not a store for it (although that is what it has become).  


No.  It was intended to be an alternative currency.  The cost associated with micro-payments is a flaw in the design, which leaves people looking to make a profit in charge of deciding which transactions will be processed and which ones will not.  


No.  It was designed to be an alternative currency.  It has proven, however, to be better utilized as a store for fiat.


No.  It was designed to be an alternative currency that people would exchange for products and goods.  Because you see its best use as a way for companies and customers to exchange fiat without government interference does not meant it was designed for that and not for bitcoin transactions worth less than a penny.


No.  It was designed as an alternative currency.  One which is, basically, infinitely divisible, with each of these divisions available for transactions.  So actually, yes it was designed for such transactions.  The value of a bitcoin, or .5BTC, or .00005BTC is incidental.  As it is now, .000005BTC is nearly worthless in terms of dollars.  If the exchange rate put a bitcoin at $100000 however, .00005BTC would have value in exchange for fiat.  The amount of bitcoin, .00005BTC would not have changed, except in relation to fiat.  The "micro" in micro-transactions refers to the amount of fiat the coin amount can be exchanged for.  
So yes, bitcoin was *absolutely* designed for micro-transactions.  Because it was designed to be an alternative currency.  The great thing about bitcoin is that it was designed to allow for transactions of pretty much *any* amount between two individuals quickly and relatively anonymously.  There is not intrinsic differenct between my giving someone 1BTC or .001BTC.  The only difference is in the amount of fiat it can be exchanged for.  So to say that bitcoin wasn't designed for micro-transactions is *really* to say that transactions of certain BTC amounts are unprofitable for the miners, and therefore subject to fees, or even rejection based on the miners' decision alone.  You can argue that this is a good thing, and that's fine.  What you *can't* say is that bitcoin wasn't *designed* for transactions of small amounts of BTC.  Because it absolutely was.  Therefore, you have a small group (miners) printing currency (mining coins) and deciding which uses are not to be acceptable (transactions which are less than a penny at the current exchange rate).
