Yeah, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference right now as far as the barrier of entry to exchanges is concerned.  One unit being $100 is a pretty sane minimum for dealing on any exchange, considering the fees involved in getting money there in the first place.
I do agree that some point in the next year, assuming Bitcoin continues to grow, people need to think about using the 1/1000 denomination as default.  Shame we couldn't all agree to rename the mBit "Bitcoin" and agree that there's now 21 billion of them - but that would get confusing :)

Yeah I think I got too excited about actually writing the word 'quadrillion' in proper context.  Fixed.

Yeah it's not the 21 million I was wondering about, that all makes perfect sense.  It's the choice of 100 million as the units of divisibility.

That's like saying the 640KB limit on RAM is only meaningful if programs start to need more RAM in the future :)

If one bitcoin private key address was represented by an object 1/10 of a mm across (the smallest a human eye can see - let's say a single particle of flour).  Then an object that represents *ALL* possible keys would be a cube where each side is 10 times the length of our milky way galaxy.
Try finding that particle of flour now!

Sorry, I meant the price of gold going down by 50%  (seems plausible looking at it's history).
If BTC goes down by 50% I'll be there waiting to buy.

 - Well here's some legal action one month later (but it's the wrong way around)

I used to spend a lot of time in Bristol, but haven't been back since the Box Tunnel Massacre.

Well, yeah.  I was assuming that the number of Bitcoins and the number of fractions of a Bitcoin are stored as the same number, not two separate numbers.
My point is that 2.1 quadrillion is nowhere near either a 32 bit or a 64 bit integer.  Just wondered why it was chosen.

So I guess there would be no way to be fully sure unless you looked at the code and compiled it yourself?

Clinker is a serious problem though, good to see somebody trying to tackle it finally.

Awesome - thanks for taking the time to clarify and update your FAQ.  I wasn't trying to implicate you guys or anything, I just think it's better for the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole if these potential security risks are identified and there are ways to put people's minds at ease.
