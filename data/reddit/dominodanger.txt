It has advantages over money transfer services that go between countries (Western Union etc) but you could also argue for store-of-value (like gold) as being the today's best and most popular use-case

Isnt the Devcoin price showing a positive return vs bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:13:15
Still a crash...

What is the takeaway supposed to be here?
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:59:45
This has not been a "lasting revival." 
Not yet at least.

Guys I don't think this is meant to be a way to pitch Grandma in investing in Bitcoin. It's just a way to explain the concept.
That said, this is a nice summary of possible talking points but there is nothing here that makes it easy to explain to someone.

Already been posted?

Got it. Wasn't sure if you were actually someone who found this on the ground or something.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:19:29
So is this just a contest to see who can brute-force it the fastest? Lol

Some how I don't think Bitcoin's market cap will be matching the total value of all the gold ever mined anytime soon.

We could be more helpful if we could see the rest of the plate...

I didn't say there was a problem. But what stops coinbase from doing rewards points?

Regardless of what this unlocks, you may not want to show this many of the words on reddit.
The security is provided by the number of words. You've now narrowed the possible guesses someone would need tremendously. There's probably someone out their that already has a program written for brute-forcing this type of seed and you've narrowed the words they need to guess from 24 to 4.
Say there is a pool of 1000 words used to construct the seed. The guesses you'd need to crack this have gone from 1000^(24) to 1000^(4) , meaning it's now about 1000^(20) times easier to hack. Possibly changing the difficulty from impossible to hack, to easy to hack.
Edit:  I see from your other comment you already realize this.

The misspelling of "finance" in the lower right somehow completes the graphic.

What's the net cost on the Visa transaction though? Pretty sure they're just taking 2%+ from the merchant and paying it to you.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:36:56
Anyone else look really closely for a private key?
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:17:50
Glad you know that already.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:27:03


Not exactly. It needs to be better than a coin flip, after trading costs and tax ramnifications.

That entire first paper doesn't even mention volatility or risk adjusted returns, which is ridiculous. 
Also both of those papers are based on very short periods of time (&lt;7 years.)
That being said, I don't think TA has all that much value, and I think it's overrated. But longer time period moving average strategies have, quite definitively, been shown to increase risk adjusted returns in many types of investments.

Is there a way to effectively get a leveraged long position (with margin trading) on the price of btc vs usd on Poloniex, or another semi-reputable exchange?
It looks like you can only take long positions on margin relative to the price of btc on Poloniex but maybe I'm missing something.

And that $6 million is now more like $13 million

No cuz bull run started when I say it started. So there.

Similar to Buffets saying "never ask a barber if you need a haircut."

I'm not saying this isn't real...but they spelled "received" wrong.
