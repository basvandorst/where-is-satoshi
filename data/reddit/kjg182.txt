I think the worst thing about the "crash" is everyone talking about instead of figuring out how to make Bitcoin more useful
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:26:36
Serious question. How is the value derived if everyone just holds?

This is pretty basic Bitcoin knowledge and it's the same everyday with a halving every 4 years and the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140

Background-Got into bitcoin just as asic mining hit the scene. Stopped after mining 1 bitcoin as I doubled my investment and mining difficulty jumped so I didn't really see much reason to keep it going because it would take me like 6 months to get the same I did in less than 1. Spent it had some left on phone wallet never wrote down keys didn't have it backed up phone died lost like $3 at the time probably worth $90 now.
If you want to get into bitcoin to just make money please invest in something else. If you want to get into it because you believe you should have control of your money and be able to exchange it with whoever you want almost instantaneously without 3rd party approval than invest and hope that becomes the norm.
I don't claim to know what the future holds and have never purchased bitcoin but it's highly speculative and currently if people aren't buying it to use but to just hold, I don't think there is much value in that.
Goodluck and hopefully you can turn a profit

Just like you do with any other asset, hopefully you have a will. In the case of cryptos, if you are the only one with access to the private key and you're gone then the crypto is more or less gone forever. Rough estimates puts about 2.7 million bitcoins are currently lost forever

These places already use digital forms outside of crypto that is less volitile like call cards and such. The fact you still and most likely will always need to covert crypto to some form of Fiat makes it pretty usueless for most in the case you just pointed out

You don't think the inventor of the Kurzweil K250 is going to create bitbrain and put us all on the internet

Well I'm holding till 2140 then I'll hold some more

No it's using new members to pay out the initial ones without creating any value other than the price will go up. Everything you mentioned has actual real world use cases outside of wealth store value. Gold is used in electronics, silver is an antimicrobial, diamonds can cut things and people live in houses.

I can't wait for Ray's dad to tell me how proud he is of his son
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:25:29

What do you mean?

No currency is backed by the economies they represent. People provide value by working in return for currency.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:25:14
unless it actually produces something of value then this is just a ponzi scheme at the moment with people betting on it keep on going up with the newest members paying out the ones who came before them.

It's not really an opinion that is just how investors look at it to see what to invest in trying to limit their risk. Bitcoin is still speculation at this point, the technology is certainly world changing but i'm not going to convince someone who is surely still using netscape explorer and Archie because obviously first movers advantage always wins and new tech never crushes the old.

They are both speculation, but if you looked at Groupon's profits and losses against their assets and liabilities you can come to a conclusion of buying or selling. Bitcoin is a commodity anyway so it's way different than a stock which represents a company that people help run. Believing that Bitcoin will make it in the end is kind of like saying, I'll always grow corn because it will be more valuable in the future and I won't sell it just use it as it's intended.

Wouldn't he keep $800 not $300
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:28:21
It's more like the late 90s early 2000s.

2 ounces at $100 that's the $200 if ounce goes up to $1000 and he still has one he has $1000. Sell $200 to payback and now he's left with $800.
