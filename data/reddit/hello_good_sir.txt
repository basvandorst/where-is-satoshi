Many of these are excellent.  My favorites are by rusty_shaklefurd, StiveGonzales, and Walrii.  They are all simple and nicely generic, I guess that the word I am looking for is "serious" but I don't like that word in this context.  I also like topheroly because of how it combines the elements, but it is too highbrow for what we need.  The ones that draw on reddit memes are not at all appropriate.  Bitcoin isn't a reddit meme; it is a revolution against central banks and the tyrants that the prop up.

Beneficial to who?  Banks?  Politicians?


stable?  In what sense?  The dollar certainly isn't stable.  It loses value constantly, sometimes faster, sometimes slower.  If bitcoin ever becomes the world currency it will gain/lose value with the economy.  It will be as if you were invested in an index fund, except that...


This is nonsense.  Central banks drive the business cycle, and thus are the primary cause of recessions and depressions.  The *entire purpose* of bitcoin is to cast off the shackles of central banking.  Bitcoin is successful because it does not have a central bank.  Bitcoin is desirable because there aren't people manipulating the money supply.  This is basic stuff.


You mean that when we serfs try to save instead of mindlessly consuming our all-knowing overlords seize the value of our money by printing more and giving it to their buddies.

Which is a strong argument in favor of a deflationary currency.  Debt is a social ill.  While I don't think that lending should be banned, it should not be a legally recognized concept.  If someone lends you money neither of you should get into trouble, but the government should not get involved if you don' pay him back.
@_date: 2011-04-23 11:34:28
If bitcoin is the primary currency then why would anyone ever consider using the dollar?  Oh that's right, they'd be forced to.  If bitcoin becomes popular you would find that some people would reject the dollar in favor of bitcoin.  These people would be hard to tax by the government, and the government would demand that these people pay their taxes in dollars.
Then because dollars would be passing through so few hands from issuance to redemption people would see the effects of the inflation tax far more clearly.  Right now i43% of the government's revenue comes from inflation.  That number is likely to increase.  So if it were 50% that means that the government spends $2 for every $1 that it takes in.  As long as the USD market is large this results in an inflation rate that isn't alarming, something in the single digits.  If the USD market were zero (people only used USD for paying taxes) then it would have an inflation rate of 100% which people would notice.

You are correct, but your link is worthless.  Given the complexities of central banking. inflation is impossible to calculate and difficult to estimate.  If we assume an inflation rate of 1% per month (which is 12.7% annually) then a $9 bitcoin should be worth $9.09 at the end of the month, not $10.

You are right.  I wonder what percent of bitcoins are on mtgox right now, rather than in peoples wallets.  I don't want it to go, I want it to lose market share to competitors.
There are two kinds of bitcoin users.  One kind uses bitcoin instead of paypal.  These are the people that get all of the hype.  These are the people buying stuff using bitcoin.  The other kind of bitcoin user uses bitcoin instead of gold.  These are the people who buy bitcoin and then hope to later sell it at the same price (well actually slightly higher, because of USD inflation) These people are often mistaken for speculators.  Well some of them are speculators.  So what I am saying is that this second group will always need low-fee exchanges, unless bitcoin takes over the world.

You will be able to buy groceries eventually.  Maybe not at the local store, but from your local farmer.

I think that we are long past that point.  I think that we can safely say that most new people have been purchasing rather than mining the bulk of their coins.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:06:53
You are missing the point.  The client needs integrated wallet management tools.  Your balance should be shown in large numbers on top of a picture of a wallet.  The wallet should be colored, maybe purple.  There should be a button on the wallet where you can encrypt it.  Instead of the balance it would then show a lock on top of the wallet.  You should then be able to drag the wallet to your desktop.  You could then drag your other wallet (the orange one) into bitcoin, click on the lock to unlock it, and see its balance.  You should be able to have two wallets open at once and there should be arrows to send money from one to another.
There should be an advanced setting which allows you to look inside of a wallet to see your "coins".  Each coin would depict an address.  So if you have 13.2 bit coins in one address it would be shown as a large coin with that amount of money on it.  You could then drag "coins" (addresses) from one wallet to another.
The whole thing needs to be very simple, very graphical, and as intuitive as possible.  Asking users to muck around with files in folders (that they have to find themselves) is completely unreasonable.

Not all currencies are the same.  Dollars are super convienient if you live in the US, but they are a poor store of value because they are controlled by a central bank.  The result is the "inflation tax" which transfers the value in your dollars to the government and the banks.  Bitcoin on the other hand is decentralized and will eventually have stable value.

Debit cards have other advantages as well.  You don't have to worry about losing your money due to it falling out of your wallet.  You can do chargebacks.  Bitcoins are also slow currently.  If you had a debit service it would be fast, faster than loading a website.

I would define bitcoin success meaning that it becomes the primary currency.  Once that happens the USD will collapse.  Once that happens the US will be unable to maintain spending levels.  Governments have trouble shrinking gracefully, so a collapse is more likely.
@_date: 2011-05-20 00:27:26
Actually the US federal government gets about 40% of its revenue by borrowing, which indirectly causes inflation, whereas the income tax is only about 25% of its revenue (once you rescale to take into account the deficit).  Thus the government gets more money by devaluing the dollar than it does by actually taxing incomes.  Bitcoins can't have their value stolen through inflation.
What this means: if no one evades taxes AT ALL and people used bitcoin instead of $ then the government would have to cut spending by 40%.
@_date: 2011-06-03 13:54:54


Contradiction.  In a complicated fractional reserve banking system people use prices to talk about inflation and deflation because no one can really be sure what the true money supply is.
In a system like bitcoin, where we know the size of the money supply, the terms "inflation" and "deflation" should only refer to the actual size of the money supply.
@_date: 2011-05-21 04:28:23
You have it all backwards.  We have more than enough people, what we don't have is much use for the coins.  There are a few websites that accept coins but right now I imagine most coins are just being kept.  Though that has some value, because one of the purposes of a currency is to store wealth.

That depends on why you are storing them.  If you expect bitcoin to be stable and the dollar to fall then are you really speculating?  Aren't you just declining to pay the inflation tax?  Also what if you are in a bit of legal trouble and expect that people will be taking money from your bank account without your consent?  Combine these two ideas and you have a way to actually save money for future use, something that required buying precious metals until bitcoin came along.

Not actually true.  The "inflation tax" covers 40% of the US federal government's budget.  Additionally a significant portion of the capital gains tax comes from inflation.  Take away a government's ability to control the currency and you have taken away half of its budget.
@_date: 2011-05-25 23:11:41
Bitcoin is not deflationary, barring the actual loss of bitcoins through misplacement.  As technology improves prices and thus wages SHOULD go down.  This is only logical.  Also logical would be that as prices and wages go down as infrastructure improves then people can cut back on labor (which would then keep wages up), thus as technology improves people can choose to have more leisure time or buy more goods.

Bitcoin is currently inflationary and will be for quite some time.  At some point losses will exceed inflation and it will be deflationary.  However people will develop methods to ensure that they do not lose their bitcoins and eventually the deflation will all but stop.  At that point the currency will be stable.  A stable currency is ideal.

I believe that they are the same as these two bulges:
The one on the left represents people trying to buy at low prices, the bulge on the right represents people trying to sell at high prices.  The price is thus always in the valley in the middle.  If the valley is broad (the hills are far apart) then no one is selling.  If the valley is narrow lots of people are in the market.  If the hills are steep the price is stable, if they are gently inclined the price is unstable.

How many transactions will there actually be in the future?  If you compare BTC to USD the BTC transactions are like BTC transactions.  However with the USD most money moves through Visa and Mastercard.  I expect that payment processors and banks will become ubiquitous in the bitcoin world, and so there will be very few actual bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2011-05-22 14:21:14
because bitcoin and the federal reserve are in deadly competition?  They will kill us if that is what it takes.  40% of the US federal government's taxes come from inflation.  If people switch to bitcoin and keep paying their taxes (unlikely) then the government will have to raise taxes by 67% or cut services by 40%, or use a combination of both.  All of these options are politically impossible over the time frame that is likely.  Thus if bitcoin catches on the federal government will collapse.  Also the Euro will collapse.  Many other governments will fall into disarray.  This is a revolution, make no mistake.

I guess that we are arguing over the definition of "intrinsic".  If we go by your definition than I would argue that nothing has intrinsic value.  You say that food has intrinsic value because you can eat it.  I say that bitcoin has intrinsic value because you can use it as money.  You say that using it as money doesn't count.  I will then say that eating food doesn't count.
If you study economics you will soon realize that goods and services do not have inherent value.  Their value comes from our desire for them.  We desire food and so objects that have the properties of food (nourishing, palatable) have value to us.   We desire money and so the objects that have the properties of money have value to us.
@_date: 2011-06-09 14:11:44
Going with a percentage won't work.  People use bitcoins for a variety of reasons.  The ones that are likely to buy from you prefer bitcoin because it is easier to use and has lower fees than paypal or a credit card.  If you only allow them to pay for a percentage using bitcoin they have to pay the rest with a method that they don't like.  You aren't making it easier for these people, you are just making it even harder (I need TWO payment methods?).
I believe in bitcoins so I would accept them for any order, but you are a bit more skeptical.  So perhaps you should only accept them for orders under $200 or something like that.  Because of growing pains bitcoin currently has trouble with very small orders (less than $1).

I for one would never consider mining because my computer isn't up to it.  Perhaps if I had been mining earlier I would have gotten upgrades to stay competitive.

is a lie.  Allow me to explain:
If people are accumulating money (savings) it means that they are putting more into the economy than they are taking out (consumption).  If they are producing but they aren't consuming, then what are they doing?  The are improving infrastrucure, this is also called "capital creation", "investment" and the like.
At some point if people save (invest in the future) they will become content.  Hey society is awesome, we have factories run by robots, I have a lot of money saved up etc... why not retire or cut back hours?  Yes, why not?  If more people can afford to not work it gives the remaining workers more bargaining power.  It evens out the power.  No longer are people wage slaves, but they are free people who will have more control over their lives.  If we switched to bitcoin I imagine that working hours would drop and benefits would rise.


Can't happen.  People need to buy things.  People want to buy things.  Things will be for sale.  Computers double in processing power every 18 months.  Doesn't seem to have stopped their adoption.  A new iPhone comes out all the time and they seem to be doing fine.  People might stop spending all of their money on junk and instead start saving a little, but I addressed the benefits of that above.

Yes.  I don't remember how long it took to verify my bank, maybe a couple of days.  Then I initiated a deposit.  After about four days the money came out of my bank account.  After five and a half days Dwolla sent me an email saying that the funds are in my Dwolla account and are available.  An hour later and they are still not available.
Once I get the money into and then back out of Dwolla I will NEVER use Dwolla again.
