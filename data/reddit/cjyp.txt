Well here you're breaking assumption two. If you think the choices are you lose the whole $40k or you gain another $1,000,000 then the $20k drop doesn't really bother you that much.
And if your life situation has changed such that you now can't afford to lose that $40k, then you're breaking assumption one (even if you weren't when you first bought).
It might be upsetting emotionally, but rationally if you follow the two assumptions the only thing that should upset you is a paradigm breaking price drop.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:24:46
There's two assumptions that lead to the hodl advice, and it's sound advice based on those assumptions. The first is that you haven't invested more than you can lose. The second is that bitcoin has two options in the long run - the moon, or zero. The first assumption means that you can wait out long downturns (or even the death of the coin). The second means that if you hold, and never sell, and the coin doesn't die, you will eventually end up rich.
If you bought more than you can afford to lose, or if you think there's an intermediate long term option for bitcoin, then the advice doesn't apply the same way.

Higher price helps bitcoin as a platform because it increases liquidity (decreasing volatility).

The number of bitcoins in existence is constant, at 21 million. The more a single bitcoin is worth, the more us dollars worth of bitcoin exist in the world. 
Compare bitcoin, with its market cap of 7 billlion (or whatever it is atm) to Euros, with a market cap in the trillions of dollars. If someone buys 500 million euros, they won't move the price much. If they buy 500 million euros worth of bitcoin, the price will spike hugely.

Seems reasonable to me. All they said is that if you want bitcoin to be a part of the standards, do something about it by helping to define the standards (or if you don't have the knowledge, get other people who do to help define the standards) 
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:43:08
Reason 1: Store against fiat inflation. Once the volatility goes away (NOT now), bitcoin should fare well against inflation.
Reason 2: International remittances. The ability to send any amount of money to anyone in the world, for a low fee, without permission from anyone, in 13 seconds (or however long it takes for the transaction to propagate through the network - your family doesn't need to wait for confirmation that you won't double spend).
Reason 3: Donations. You can donate to anyone, anywhere, as easily as sending an email, no matter who doesn't want the recipient receiving money. Key phrase here being 'as easily as sending an email'.
Reason 4: Illegal things. No elaboration really needed; it can and will happen, and regardless of how anyone else values bitcoin it will always have value to people who want to buy drugs, or gamble online (might or might not be illegal, depending on where you live). And it's not a strike against bitcoin (that's an entirely different argument), it's just one thing giving it value.
Reason 5: A distributed, unforgeable timestamp server. There is a lot of value in that (maybe not to individuals, but certainly to businesses), and it doesn't really exist outside of blockchain technology.
Reason 6: Discounts. This isn't really implemented much yet, but not dealing with credit card fees will allow companies to charge less for this. This is at the bottom because it's arguable businesses will just take the profits and/or consumers will just never know about it.
@_date: 2014-10-26 13:12:48
That's reasonable. I guess as long as it's one syllable it doesn't matter too much which it is. 
That said, I do personally like the sound of 'bits' better than 'mikes'. Clearly 'liking the sound of bits better' isn't usually a valid argument, but I think this is one area where it might have some weight to it. Maybe.

2. Yet
3. Who are people? Somehow I doubt the people begging places to take donations and the people complaining about donations overlap much, unless (as in the case of Wikipedia) there actually is something to complain about. It's just that the people who want someone to accept donations go silent once they do, and the complainers find something new to complain about.
4. And, in fact, was what first gave bitcoin value. So bitcoiners all owe something to people who do illegal things. That's history, and can't really be argued.
5. Yet. And can you come up with a better system for that? I can't. If someone does, then that'll be fine, but for now bitcoin is what we have for this purpose.
6. Yes, it's my weakest point and thus is at the bottom. I still think bitcoin makes it easier to do this over the internet.
And to respond in advance to the argument that 'yet' is not really an acceptable answer because there's no reason for consumers to put money into bitcoin now - that's fine, but the people making those things easier stand to make a lot of money off of doing so, or at least gain a lot of fame (which translates to money because they'll be given better job offers by companies). So that's the reason to put effort or money into developing bitcoin services - change those 'yet's into 'now's.

Let's say the are 1000 bitcoin at $500 each available on an exchange. Some millionaire wants to invest a million dollars into bitcoin. Since there's only $500,000 worth of bitcoin available at $500 on the exchange, if she tries to invest it all at once she'll cause a huge price spike. Now let's say there's instead 1000 bitcoin available at $5000 - the millionaire can now invest a million dollars without changing the price, since there's $5,000,000 worth of bitcoin available at $500. That's a simplified example, but the principle holds. The more bitcoin is worth, the more dollars worth of bitcoin can be bought (increased liquidity) without changing the price (decreased volatility).

No, that's the system working exactly as planned actually.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:45:40
It doesn't. It increases the maximum block size, which has two side effects. It makes it harder to run a full node (8x harder, though only if the blocksize actually becomes larger), because it'll be harder to run one on your home network. And it allows 8x as many people to join the network, which multiplies the number of people who want to run a node by 8x. So it won't actually hurt anything, and it'll allow bitcoin to grow past its current size (which right now it basically can't).

@_date: 2015-08-23 23:36:53
Okay, that's the root of our disagreement then. You think mining and running nodes should be possible from a home connection (in which case 8gb blocks would be tough to accommodate - though it's not 8gb for 20 years, and it could be by then). I don't think bitcoin should require that to be possible. I believe that requiring that to be possible would make it impossible to put small transactions on the blockchain. And I think it's more important to allow anyone to be able to put their morning coffee on the blockchain if they so choose than to allow anyone to run a node from their home connection.
That can be somewhat of a false dichotomy, but I don't think both would be possible if bitcoin gains much in popularity. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:36:14
Anyone can buy this sort of connectivity for really cheap, so the only miners who get weeded out are the ones not willing to spend the small amount of money required to increase their bandwidth. 
Note that the node the miners are connecting to does not need to be in the same physical location as the miners, so the miners can be located in China but their node in South Korea (which has some of the best Internet speeds in the world). To mine only the node needs to download the block, the miners just need the header. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:10:13
Not really - the pool operator can be physically located in one country and have their servers in a different country. But anyway, I'm sure there are places in China where you could rent a server with plentiful bandwidth. Those places may just not be near where the cheap power is. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:40:04
I don't see why big blocks would stop that from happening. All these countries have some place with good enough connection to host nodes that can handle big blocks. Therefore pools will set up in those countries. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:53:37
That's a problem. Pretty much no matter how much of the hash power you have, you'll end up making things worse for yourself - either you trigger a fork you don't want, in which case the fork ends up split much closer to 50/50 than it would otherwise have. Which is really really bad for the ecosystem as a whole. Or you could have single handedly prevented the fork by just not doing anything. Which is better for you if you don't like the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:35:20
What do jurisdiction and neutrality have to do with the block size debate?
@_date: 2015-08-23 22:09:21
Nah, I think the demand for pools with nodes located in a bunch of different places will offset any disadvantage from having to wait 10 seconds more than competitors to download or upload blocks. 
EDIT to say - thanks for keeping the debate civil and not resorting to ad homenim arguments or other fallacies. Lots of people on both sides of the debate are just trolls, obviously you're not.
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:39:30
This is a terrible idea. Let's say 26% of the hash power agrees with you and runs your client. You could end up triggering the fork, where it wouldn't have triggered otherwise! And with less than 75% consensus at that! We'd get a 50/50 split on the two chains, and that could last a long time, irreparably harming bitcoin.
Let's say less than 26% of the hash power agrees with you. Then the work will happen anyway, and you just made it happen sooner! People would probably still convert in the two week waiting period, and suddenly you'll find yourself mining orphaned blocks.
I see no way this can possibly be better than the fork just happening or not happening naturally.
@_date: 2015-08-25 13:52:56
My understanding is there are artifacts all over the code that prevent block size from being greater than 32mb, and these are present in both (so XT would need to do another hard fork too to get past 32mb). The 1mb cap on the other hand is just a few lines of code.
That could be a flawed interpretation though.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:14:50


Nope. I don't see how, if bitcoin grows in popularity much, it would be possible for any small transactions to occur. And I think people should be able to make small transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. 


If we wait until they are, it'll be too late. And the nice thing about BIP101 is if nobody's desperate to increase the block size cap then it won't happen until people are.


Sigh. We were doing so well until now. I don't want to hear about agendas because I could just as easily say it's ridiculous how people are trying to block a block size increase to push an agenda. Neither of those statements are productive. (and there is a BIP101 only client without any of the other XT patches out there)


I don't think this debate is killing bitcoin. I actually think it's healthy to have a somewhat fractured community of people who don't trust each other - it makes it harder for bad changes to go through (whether increasing the block size is a bad change or not is up to the community to decide, not the devs or anyone else). Remember, Satoshi created bitcoin taking into full account the nature of humans. If it can't survive something simple like a fractured community and developers who disagree, then it's a failure. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:53:04
We're talking about the miners who today are against raising the block size because they can't handle anything bigger (or so they say).

You're not creating larger blocks to gain transaction fees, you're creating larger blocks to push competitors out of business.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:49:22


Nope. The asics don't need to download the whole block. The asics only need the block header. The block header is pretty small, so it can be downloaded from Korea fairly quickly regardless of Internet connection (if their internet connection is too slow to download a block header then they can't even mine 1mb blocks). The node in Korea can deal with downloading and validating the actual block. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:34:15
If the uncertainty lasts longer than a day or two, yes. I think in the situation where 75% of miners are on the XT chain the core chain wouldn't last longer than a day.

Regardless, I'd be much more worried about a pool mining empty blocks and decreasing the block size. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:24:45
No problem!
Without context, it's definitely really hard to believe that one exchange going down could cause a 75% crash.
Another part of the problem was that Mt. Gox blamed their going down on a bug in bitcoin. That was a lie - there was a small bug that you can lose a little bit of money to if you don't know of its existence, but there's no way they lost the amount of money they claim to have lost to that bug (look up transaction malleability if you're curious). So there might have been some extra panic added to the mix because of that, otherwise it might have only fallen to $600 or so (the level it settled at before the bear market took hold).
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:04:23
Meh... An auto scaling limit based on a factor of a median block size seems vulnerable to attacks, malicious or not. Many pools mine empty blocks because they propagate faster, and that would bring the average way down. Conversely, miners can fill the blocks up 100% for free by creating spam transactions whose fees go to themselves, and that would bring the average way up (possibly forcing mining pools with worse internet connections out of business).
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:06:47
The difficulty would be too high relative to the number of miners. One block would be found every 40 minutes, and that block would be 1mb or smaller. It wouldn't be able to sustain the transaction volume.
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:28:52
Miners can choose to mine blocks of whatever size they want. However, users (both other miners and regular users) will reject blocks larger than 1mb, orphaning the large block and preventing it from becoming part of the blockchain. If a group of users decide they'll accept blocks larger than 1mb, and another group of users decides not to, then they'll end up with different views of the blockchain once the first large block is mined. That's what people mean when they talk about a fork.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:26:10


We're both repeating ourselves, and I don't think either of us is going to convince the other. But that's besides the point.
Any big city will have enough bandwidth available to run a node. There are big cities all over the world, in plenty of countries that dislike each other. Miners can choose which of those cities to point their asics to, and if there's demand for a pool in some city with light regulation then someone will set up a pool there.
@_date: 2015-08-18 01:34:08
For the purposes of this comment, I don't care whether or not XT happens or not. What you're doing is worse *either way*. Spoofing consensus where it doesn't exist is going to harm the ecosystem more than a fork with (albeit weak) consensus.
And switching spv nodes to reject big blocks seems... Implausible? They work either way right now, I don't see why anyone would use a restricted client by choice. They'd be opening themselves up to double spend attacks if the fork does go through.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:39:34


The US, China, Japan, Korea, the UK, Singapore, France, Germany, India, Australia, probably more that I can't think of - you can get a server connection that can handle 8gb blocks in any of those countries. And the list will just go up as time goes on. 
Edit - and that's countries, not cities.
@_date: 2015-08-23 16:09:23
That's not what I'm saying at all. 
What I'm saying is, let's say a miner's physical devices mining bitcoin is located in China and have very strict bandwidth requirements. For not very much money, the miner can set up a full node in Korea with an internet connection that can easily handle big blocks. 
With the node in Korea validating blocks for them, the only thing the physical devices need to download on the poor internet connection is the block **headers** - which are a constant size no matter how big the blocks are.
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:56:16
Mt. Gox is why it was in the quadruple digits in the first place. The crash was really just the Mt Gox scam ending and reality taking hold. So without Mt Gox we'd have neither the climb to $1000 nor the crash back to $300.
@_date: 2015-08-01 05:32:20
That is not actually correct. People asking questions they don't know the answer to gives us as a community a better idea of what information isn't really out there enough. 
And on an individual level, answering questions (even questions whose answers seem obvious to you) helps shore up your own understanding. So it's well worth somebody's time to explain it.

Unfortunately that's the gamblers fallacy. You're just as far along if you just sent a transaction (and waited a few seconds for it to propagate to the whole network) as you would be if you've waited 10 minutes and there hasn't yet been a block. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:36:07
I was going to do that when I got home from work. Thank you for saving me some effort :)
It's very counterintuitive. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:10:21
Hm maybe I should clarify that I'm referring to time until the next block, and assuming that you've paid enough fee to get into that block. If that makes me wrong then so be it. 
The problem is it's a bit counterintuitive. If you ask me how long I would expect it to take until the next block is found, I would say 10 minutes (or 9 if it's been a while since the last difficulty retarget). I wouldn't check if the last block was found two seconds ago or an hour ago. That's because what the miners are doing is calculating many individual instances of sha-256, and each instance is itself independent. 
For analogy, imagine I have a deck of ten cards, nine hearts and one spade. I shuffle it and show you one card. It's a heart. I then put that card back in the deck, shuffle again, and show you a card. What's the chance the next card I show is a spade? Still 1/10. Let's say I do this 100 times and it's a heart each time. What's the chance it'll be a spade on the 101st time? Still 1/10. How many draws would you expect it to take for a spade to show up at the start? After the 101st consecutive heart? I don't actually know (it's not 10), but it's the same for both draws. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:45:11
The reason I use that description is because finding a block basically is a lottery. Swap cards for sha-256 hashes and swap spades for valid block headers, and that's what mining is. It takes a certain unit of time to find a hash, and the difficulty adjusting algorithm ensures that on average the number of hashes it takes to find a valid header (multiplied by that unit of time) is ten minutes.
I realize we're thinking about this in different ways, but unfortunately I'm at work so I can't take more time to write fuller responses.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:33:02
I think I can convince you that the average isn't 5 minutes, though this won't convince you that it's 10. The problem is you're not accounting for the times when the bus shows up more than 10 minutes after the last one. If I show up 5 minutes after a bus it could still be 20 minutes until the next one. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:23:09


Unfortunately the math doesn't work that way. Each hash has an equal chance of finding a block, and finding one hash that isn't valid doesn't make it easier to find a valid hash later. Because of that it's always an average of 9 minutes until the next block is found regardless of how long its been since the last one.

Please stop. People say luke-dashjr is a religious nutcase and that Roger Ver sells explosives over the internet. Neither of those things matter to the discussion.
I'm replying to you, but the comment op (who mentioned luke being religious) is doing the same thing.

The way to fix this is to randomize the port bitcoin uses every startup like torrents do.

What portion of bitcoin users actually use full nodes these days? Many of us enthusiasts here at do, but many bitcoin users keep their coins in an online service, an offline wallet, or an spv node. Those users won't have a choice of which chain to use. In a situation where the major exchanges and online services are mostly on one chain, that chain will have the majority of users. And I'd guess (this is the weakest part of my argument because it's entirely conjecture) that the online services would switch to whatever the majority of miners are doing. Users with offline wallets have no influence (and aren't affected by the fork anyway). And spv node users would have a huge incentive to make the bigger fork win as quickly as possible, so if their software lets them choose they'd probably choose the fork with the most hash power.

That was an extreme example, but the point I was trying to make is that a majority of mining power (combined with a majority of users) can make any change they want if they work together - there's no real point in trying to defend against that.

But see, now you're ad hominim attacking the 'rbtc numpties'.
Returning the favor doesn't help or convince anyone.

Are miners able to figure out the miners fee for an individual transaction? If so, this is a great idea. If not, people would just never pay a fee because miners wouldn't know, so miners wouldn't actually ever mine these transactions.

It could just be the case that there are more complaints about it when the price goes up... Or you could be right. We don't really have enough information to know.

I'm a bit uncomfortable with ad hominim arguments like that.

Not trying to argue anything else here, just pointing out that 51% of miners can destroy bitcoin by rejecting any blocks with any transactions at all in them. It's a well known weakness of bitcoin, and not one that can be easily defended against.

It's pseudo anonymous, not fully anonymous. The blockchain has a record of every transaction that anyone can see. It can be linked to you in several ways, the easiest being if you reuse addresses.
