get some good graphics cards 4gb to 8gb cards (8gb is better) go to nanopool.org pick a few coins to mine and download the miners. you will need wallet addresses for each corresponding coin for instance a decred coin needs a decred wallet address and ethereum needs an etherium wallet address. if you want to mine with your hardrives you must mine burstcoins because as far as i know they are the only proof of capacity coin and are easy on the electricity. there are also a lot of other coins such as gridcoin that can be mined with your processor which i found to use lots of electricity. i mine eth and dcr and burst

you seem to know a lot about money and past history with bubbles but you know very little about bitcoin and I get the impression you are biased and sway in the bankers favour. if you dont like bitcoin and think its a bubble that is your opinion and you are entitled to think that but bitcoin is a technology and a currency and the technology is not a bubble.

the government cant stop bitcoin, we are not breaking any laws using it and if regulation sucks we go back to dark net \(highly unlikely\) and it is beneficial to the economy to have an alternative to banking. There was no alternatives before just monopoly's which are detrimental to economy's and people

At this point less than 5% of available coins are going around and around on the exchanges, creating an illusion of 'the price' of bitcoin.

If you are poor and desperate you should be seeking food and shelter and not btc i agree wholeheartedly but there will always be fools like the old saying goes "there is an arsehole for every seat" and the same goes for investors. saying bitcoin is flawed as a long investment is a moot point as it is purely speculative. knowbody knows if it will go up or down yet, so even as an avid btc investor i cannot recommend investing or not investing and make it clear to people don't spend more than you can afford to lose. what will sway peoples decisions to invest or not is coming from outside institutions such as banks and governments. how these institutions have treated their customers/people in the past will ultimately force their decision one way or another. also btc is the only alternative to the banking monopoly and that needs healthy competition which helps the economy.

@_date: 2018-05-02 17:06:07
fiat will always exist as long as there is government and banks and there will always be gov and banks imo. bitcoin is an alternative to banking and an alternative that was needed to level the playing field as the banks were a monopoly untill bitcoin.
"the rate of inflation/deflation can't easily be controlled as it can be with government issued fiat." why would you want anyone controling a free market?. thats the problem with banks and governments once they control the money they control the people to a point were they are not free any more and now anyone who is fed up with there shit has an alternative. i cant see a bad side yes people will need banks but people like me need bitcoin more
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:59:54
as well as the price of btc going up i also think mining hardware costs will also go up if you only get half the reward for the same amount of asics you run. also electricity costs go up anually this will make btc more expensive to mine in certain parts of the world...what im trying to say is no matter what btc is going up
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:27:38
you sound like someone who has never used bitcoin its convenient when you know how to use it (are you stupid or afraid of new tech?) and since when is bankcards convenient i have to physicaly get up and move to get cash from a bank machine somewhere i dont want to walk to and then i have to put up with banks changing terms and conditions every day because they thought up another way to take fees or overdraft poor people to keep them in debt and therefor in their pocket.... fuck the banks and anyone who loves them
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:23:42
yes and then imagine combining these big dips with say dumping mtgocs btc to "reimburse customers with fiat" (customers who wanted btc). so obvious that the gov, banks and shills are full of shit. if everyone buys btc they lose, if half buy in, they lose. the simple fact that btc is here means they lose as there was no alternative to the banking monopoly before btc. btc is also innovating faster than the banks and governments to the point that they cant/wont keep up and the more innovative technology always wins. digital money with no borders or artificial barriers beats hepatitis c and cocaine covered bank notes money is the dirtiest thing in the world and sotoshie cleaned it

Of course they are. it would be foolish to think the banksters do not want to monopolise another market probably trying to buy all the exchanges as we speak and will try everything to preserve there monopoly... we need more financial equality even now
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:25:11
it depends on where you live. in the united kingdom to generate 1 bitcoin you have to take into account the cost of the graphics card(gtx1070 or gtx1080) and also the cost of electricity which is cheaper in usa than uk. it costs me 2$ to run my computer each day and i turn it on all day it earns me 1$(on average) in crypto per day...you must do the maths each country has different prices for cards and electricity. edit spelling edit 2: it actually turned out cheaper to keep the computer on 24/7 than not mine and turn it off

i noticed this too they always say you are too late and mining brings no profits but btc and btc mining have always brought delayed profits  as more buy in. its too early to say its "too late" this tech is only 10 years old and the financial sector has been shunning it to no avail. the network gets bigger and more resilient everyday and is the longest running network ever that has had zero downtime...the price reflects these attributes

so secure transactions are the only good thing about btc. the poorest countries in the world are utilising btc toget into markets they previously had no access due to banks not giving them bank accounts becouse they were too poor and therefore could not make any money out of them also venezuela needs btc right now as there currency is being used to wipe their ass because its worth less than toilet paper. btc is is great if you want to save as you might get 1% on your savings at a bank and all the while they print money making your savings worth less so 1%- about 10% savings fun with banks. if you save btc the current 10 year trend tells you that you will earn if you hold it long enough. Also we can see where the btc goes can you see were the money goes...no you cant even if it is sent to the middle east to fund both sides of a war just some points off the top of my head there. satoshi never mentioned forks or shitcoins but things happen obstacles arise' clowns shill, and  shitcoins appear daily its a brave new world and to make some money in crypto you got to have some money in crypto. governments cannot control or minipulate BTC niether can banks it is a free and open market that is growing everyday and will benefit the next generations more that it benefits us as it is the only alternative to the banking monopoly and that monopoly has needed some healthy competition for about 150 years now this is why wall street and goldman sachs and chase bank own you and the companys you work for and your children will be payed slaves just like us if you dont support healthy cometition

no it is not it takes time, energy, money and brains to generate a bitcoin. i compare it to advertising or marketing. adverts and ideas are worth lots of money but you cannot hold them in your hand just. btc is as real as the air you breath. hell people are trying to steal bitcoin they are willing to go to jail for it. your argument was funny when btc was 400$ its ridiculous now

if you are investigated by police in the uk and you withhold evidence you are breaking the law. i cannot find the law for you as it is not a law associated with bitcoin directly it is a law pertaining to encryption keys for instance a pedo has an encrypted message and the law want his encryption keys

@_date: 2018-12-20 07:47:53
I think you will find you are wrong. if you are being investigated by a government agency ie: the police or court they can (and will) demand your private keys and if you do not comply you can recieve up to 2 years in prison. If you have given these private keys to someone else and they do not give up the keys they are subject to the 2 years in prison. this law was in place years ago
