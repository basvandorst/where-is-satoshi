Iirc this is exactly how this currency system started in the first place. In other words, the scam is that they are the ones who create all the money and loan it out, yet ask for more back which literally cannot exist since they are the source of the currency and give it out on the basis of getting more back.

Yeah I put in £5k and it made £700 alone, somehow I'm in the green still despite crypto going down.

Yeah no organisation needs to be an intermediary, it will work independently no matter what and that's what's good about cryoto. But it doesn't mean you can't use an intermediary for security or insurance purposes. That's pretty much needed for sites like eBay and it doesn't necessarily need to be a bank or PayPal that insures your payment.
Edit: on second thought, you're right because there's no way a bank will take responsibility for your wealth unless they can access and use it, which would defeat the point of crypto. Perhaps for some transfers people will use something like PayPal though.

But unlike those things if someone steals it they would have to actually break into your house making it way more a big deal. In fact people don't store big amounts of gold for this very reason. You would most likely store it somewhere where the keepers are responsible and insured, ie a BANK. It's not the same as fiat still because it's not a made up number they can just re-enter into your account, they would have to pay you the money out of their own pocket that they actually have to own. It's safe storage, not the way our banks work currently.

Actually I think you're probably right, perhaps only for eBay payments would an intermediary be good, because it's too easy to scam people that way. I'm just thinking there will be horror stories of people getting their savings cleared out by not storing their keys correctly... Yes it will be their fault for not being careful, but at the moment people don't have to worry at all about security so that will have to change, and well yes that's a good thing really and comes with being responsible for your own wealth.

Well I'm sure that's more difficult to do than steal a private key... Maybe

Yeah the problem with crypto is that if your key is comprised that's pretty much it, there's no one you can turn to

If you are not trolling... you understand that bitcoin is a human invention, made for the sole purpose of a person or persons owning a particular value? The horror be of human's that they can't enforce their own currency in fear they couldn't really "own numbers". Last month, someone held a gun against my head and made me tell them my private key, and while they were sentenced to assault, it didn't count as robbery because well, people can't own numbers. And well yesterday I think I learned from the whole ordeal because when someone called by asking for my credit card details, I told them all, knowing that really I had no ownership over these numbers. 
In a way, the numbers own themselves, we should leave them be to live out their happy lives without humans, their lives so much better without our constant manipulation and claims of ownership. I can only hope we further legislate so that the numbers can have their harddrives and processors back, I don't doubt what horror we've caused them.

Of course it would never be zero? People aren't just going to give it away?

The most reliable way for a return is to spend time and bond with his daughter, giving her the love and validation she needs to get her through life

I didn't say you couldn't...
