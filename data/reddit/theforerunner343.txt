You wouldn't even necessarily have to move there, you could just send it there. People are doing this already by sending their rigs to partners in areas with cheaper energy.

Anything is within the realm of possibility. But I'd say real estate is still a safer bet than bitcoin or dollars

So, I'm a bit confused here, maybe somebody can help me out. I just made a BTC transfer from GDAX wallet to Binance wallet. GDAX says transfer is complete and has a transfer ID but no hash ID. Nothing has shown up in Binance and when I search the blockchain for both addresses, I'm not seeing any transactions. What's going on here?

The reason he didn't have a btc to his name is because his passion is providing education on cryptocurrency. Now that he has the resource of $1.6M in btc just means that an endless amount of new doors have opened for him to achieve his passion. He will, undoubtedly, be thinking about the best way to make $1.6M spread cryptocurrency education even further.

I actively tried to buy $200 worth in 2010. I signed up with an exchange, but couldn't get verified because I had moved around a bunch and addresses matching were causing an issue. I also didn't have a camera or camera/phone to upload ID. I decided the process was not worth the hassle and gave up. That investment would have been worth $100M today.
It's easy to look back and say that you should have done it.  But the reality is that there's no way we could have known. A few months ago, it made me sick to my stomach to think about. I was also quite depressed. But here's a fact, which should be a positive thought, is that we are no worse off now than we were back then. We had no way of knowing what would happen. We could have easily invested and cashed out after only doubling our money. We could have lost it all in the mt gox fiasco. We could have been scammed or thieved. There are a number of routes it could have gone and it's not as black and white as you think.
Please, friend, if you really are suicidal, find encouragement in these words. Life is not worth giving up on because you missed a chance to be a millionaire.

There is not only a point, but also cause to be looking at cryptos other than btc/ltc/eth. Crypto is still very new and evolving daily. The current big hitters are still very flawed and there will be new cryptos with more solid governing rules than the current. I think Dash has a solid chance at becoming top dog.

Mining is geographically independent in that if itçs too expensive to do it somewhere, you can go do it elsewhere where it's more cost efficient. You aren't "tied down" to one specific location.

This. I keep reminding people that you don't have to either bet on bitcoin or the dollar. Your assets will still hold their value more or less. If you're uncertain of the future, just put more of your wealth into stable, physical assets like real estate. Whether we're exchanging dollars or bitcoin, people will always need a place to live.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:16
Some physical assets are going to hold their value more or less after the collapse of fiat. That being said, if your bitcoin is up 200k and you sell and put that fiat directly into an asset like real estate, that wealth is staying with you whether it's worth dollars or bitcoin later on doesn't matter.

With $1.6M in gifted BTC he may be able to afford just that.

Sure you can. BTC is up 9% since yesterday so you'd still have 5% gain. And you'd have 22% gain if you bought last week.

They said they're working on updating the UI to be able to trade those small amounts. just have to be patient. But it would have been nice of them to let us know before we started exchanging.

Don't listen to this because it's wrong. Transferring from coinbase to GDAX is free as well as transferring from GDAX to wallet.

I had a really shitty Christmas several years ago. I ended my night drinking at a Japanese bar. A woman and her boyfriend were sitting next to me and they were really kind and even bought me a couple drinks. Really helped me end the night on a good note and I remembered. A couple years later, I saw her when I was out with friends, she waited our table. She didn't remember me. I didn't say anything to remind her, because I didn't want to end up in the awkward situation of me saying something and her not remembering at all. Anyways, as the night went on, I could tell that she was really stressing so I left her a $50 tip (the rest of my table tipped her as well so $50 in addition to everyone else). She approached me as I was leaving to thank me and said that the $50 was really going to help her out. She still didn't remember me and I still didn't remind her.

I've heard a few people now talking about how the US may try to ban cryptocurrency. That seems like such an uphill battle. I don't doubt that they might do it. But there must be some people within the government who are smart enough to support an alternative? Like, say, government funded mining? So that when bitcoin starts replacing fiat currencies, the US has a large share and is ready for the change. It seems like embracing it is the way to go since it will make for a smoother transition, while simultaneously ensuring that a destabilization of fiat currencies happens at all.

I don't think you understand Andreas' mission. He just wants to spread the education of cryptocurrency. I'm sure he's glad that other people are adopting his philosophy and words. The more people that share his knowledge is the further he reaches. He can't win the world on his own. These "copycats" are helping him get thebword out.

Yes. If you're buying with coinbase, that will be the case. The other option with coinbase is to deposit funds into your USD wallet from your bank account. Then, once the funds show up in your wallet, you can buy coins instantly. So the difference being when you buy coins from bank account, you're subject to whatever price fluctuations happen over the next seven days, good or bad.

I'm lucky enough to be a dumb person that has very intelligent close friends. I got an email from one of them about a month ago including all of said friends saying that if we weren't looking into bitcoin already we should be. SO I called him and we had about an hour long phone conversation. I have at least a basic understanding of crypto now, but not nearly enough to Make any choices with certainty. But my friend is certain that crypto will be the future very soon. So certain that he has put something like 10% of his net wealth into it. Me, being of simple mind, base my most important life choices off of what my smartest friends are doing, which has gotten me far. So, I followed suit and invested in BTC, ETH, and LTC. I still don’t fully understand what will happen in the future, but I’ve never regretted following them before. HODL ON TO YA BUTTS!

The fees are moreso determined by network congestion and those wishing to get transactions completed quickly will drive the fees up? And I suppose the miners have a say as well because if the fees are too low, they'll just stop mining.

Impossible to convert it back? It seems like theywould have to make it impossible by banning *any* current exchange. You could just convert your bitcoin to yuan or whatever and then chamge it from yuan to USD, right? Seems like you should be safe as long as you keep the bulk of your btc in a wallet instead of a US based exchange. I'm fairly new to the bitcoin scene, so I must be making a wrong assumption somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:58:06
