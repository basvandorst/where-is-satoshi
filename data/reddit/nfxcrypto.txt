'The campaign liberated twice as many people and twice as much territory as in the previous 28 months under President Barack Obama, according to Defense Department figures,' McIntyre wrote. 
In the tweet, the president quoted McIntyre's next paragraph that said: 'On Jan. 20 — the day Trump was inaugurated — an estimated 35,000 ISIS fighters held approximately 17,500 square miles of territory in both Iraq and Syria. As of 12/21, the U.S. military estimates the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles...'
The tipping point against ISIS, McIntyre wrote, came when Mosul, a city in northern Iraq, was liberated earlier this year. 
'The liberation of Mosul was followed quickly with victories in Tal Afar, Hawija, and Al Qaim in Iraq in late summer and fall, and then a crushing blow as the Islamic State’s other capital, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed Syrian fighters,' the Washington Examiner reporter wrote.
