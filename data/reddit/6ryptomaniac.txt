I think the google ban won't have any such long term effect on bitcoin value. The induscry is not going away just because of that. I personally use a cloaker ad agency's services out of Singapore (Fifth Season Enterprise) that enables to post ads regardless for Binance, Indacoin and the likes. The only one I have had an issue doing this with is Bitmex who caught on my work-around. Like some have said above, news about bitcoin prices have very short shelf live.

I don't know what to think about all the back and forth. It seems everyone is trying to stop the juggernaut. I personally have been using the cloaking services of consulting company out of singapore, called fifth season enterprises, thanks to which I have been able to get around google ad banned. It works fine with binance and indacoin but Bitmex busted my account and call me out on it.

I actually also found a company in singapore called fifth season enterprises who would run ads for private investors. They run ads for Bitmex and  Binance among others using a cloaker. It worked for me for a while and they managed getting my ads around google but I ultimately got busted by bitmex. So all this is great news!!!

The ban was so obtrusive. I circumvented it by using the cloaking services of a company called fifth season enterprises in Singapore. I was able to keep getting affiliate referral with Bitmex and Binance, though Bitmex eventual got wise to it and sent me my cease and desist orders.

I guess it's good for some people and bad for othesr. The google didn't affect me for too long. After looking for work-arounds I happened to find a company based out of Hong Kong, that would run my ads using a cloaker and thus got me past the google ban, unfortunately while it worked for Binance and few other ones, Bitmex called me out on it and gave the good old cease and desist.

It's definitely legit. Who really knows what got into google to take such measure. For my part, I'm using work around through and ad company in Singapore called Fifth Season Enterprises, that post my ads thanks to cloaking. It's been working like a charm for various platforms such as Binance, Indacoin and Coinmama. I've only encountered difficulties with Bitmex who flagged my account and cancelled my referrals.
