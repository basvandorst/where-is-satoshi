1,638 users here. Nothing near the front page so I have to imagine it's due to the changetip push. So..it's working. Investors see thi and buy / close shorts before the newly interested start buying.
Keep up the efforts. The year could end on a nice rally

Agreed. It's better money that can now exist because of the internet.

only changetip knows
Would be cool if they add charts, stats, possibly leader boards in the future. If the effort continues for a few weeks it could really snowball into something big

I'll take some to spread around. Cheers

Age, income, net-worth, responsibilities..are all things that should be considered. Up to any amount that will allow you to sleep well at night.

It hasn't hurt. Investors see the activity and have foresight. It's not from the people being tipped though. That will take time.

I mentioned in a previous post that they would need to lower fees or get undercut but at this time I don't see the fee as too ridiculous. Although a lot of tipping is taking place not a huge amount is withdrawn from the service. Most is inserted and tipped around as far as I can tell.
Once volume picks up and people actually rely on tips as their profession then I believe 1% won't fly. Right now it is bitcoin advocates tipping. Later on it will be individuals who receive tips for their content / livelihood.
Another work around could be charging $.10 - $.50 for every deposit, instead of withdrawal. A fee to use the service instead of a tax for receiving.

Yes. The honest, verifiable, decentralized ledger will prevail.
It's only a matter of awareness and education

1,400+ users and nothing I see near a front page. It's been awhile.
Tips seems to be pulling in people from everywhere

bitcointip worked well on reddit and transfered through the blockchain


It's 1% on withdrawals. If you plan on sending it doesn't matter too much. But saying that..if they don't reduce the fee a new "changetip" will compete and eat their lunch.
The hype is here because it's a fantastic way to distribute bitcoin and gran others attention while doing it. 1,700 users here so it's working
