Good try on crypto scenarios.

Fair report, evil has nothing to do with media but the people behind evil.

Good news to the whole cryptocurrency industry.

It is a good thing for the whole cryptocurrency industy.

Because transfer the cryptos out and in from exchanges is not cost\-effective, especially to those daily traders like me.

GREAT FIREWALL. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:30:31
No, just happened. Read my words carefully.

Blocked.

It is my own prediction, the reason is very clear, GFW means strong governance, people can not visit exchange's website, lower volume transaction, lower price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:04:41
keep holding for a very long time, the price will come back
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:14:34
My own prediction.
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:03:02
cryptocurrency's price rise power still very weak
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:42:34
Bitcoin prices have been slightly up after several rounds of consolidation and are getting closer and closer to the highs. I am optimistic on its trend.
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:47:05
Yeah, but i guess sell too early may lost a BIG profit
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:21:54
Bitcoin prices have stood firm 10,000 US dollars, we better take the hands of the currency， DO NOT SELL YOUR COINS！
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:19:16
Very rational thinking, you will definitely make a lot of money

Bitcoin is not a panacea. Only when supervision becomes more complete can Bitcoin develop healthier. If you continue to tolerate scams, dark nets, or criminals hiding them, the price of Bitcoin will be lost.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:53:34
You better hold all your coins for a very long time
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:23:02
Binance,bitfinex, bitmex, gate.io,  etc. The main digital currency exchanges have been shielded by GFW, and the price of bitcoin is bound to fall sharply in the coming period. SELL your coins ASAP. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:09:06
The price reflect my prediction. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:47:11
good news!
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:33:23
You don't know what GFW is.

There are a lot of technical details of the hardware wallet that cannot be disclosed to the public. Of course, there is a risk that you guess. So you can actually consider using a wallet that stores the private key locally and the source code is completely open source, such as TWallet. If you're worried about losing your digital assets, just read the TWallet's source code, and you will not worry about it at all.

It would be easier for it to bake eggs, LOL

The value of all things in the world is based on the human perspective as the sole criterion for judgment. After a long history of evolution, human needs have long been complex and diverse. Food fills hunger, gold meets value storage, and cryptocurrency is only a means to further extend value storage.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:20:20
Of course you can buy partial bitcoins, but the paper wallet is more likely to be lost or damaged, consider using a more secure cryptocurrency wallet, such as TWallet.

Cryptocurrency and fiat currency will co\-exist for a long period of time. The forking of cryptocurrencies and the production of spam alt\-coins, the inflation of the fiat currency, and the devaluation of the fiat currency. These issues are happening all over the world at all times. The generation of these problems has nothing to do with the media or technology behind them. It is essentially the greed and fear of human nature.

Nasdaq will launch the cryptocurrency trading function in the near future. It is totally unacceptable for the above bankers' opinions.
@_date: 2018-04-30 09:32:03
Yeah, TWallet will also use Lightning network in the small payment scenario.

Nothing is absolute, just as information on the wikipedia is not 100&amp; accurate. There is no point in talking about absolute security. Compared with closed source, I believe in open source, especially when you can compile and build executable programs based on open source code.
