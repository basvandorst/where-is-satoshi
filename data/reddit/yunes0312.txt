In your attack scenario, why would it get expensive for the attacker? An attacker adds transactions until the blocks are half full, which is cheap, and then the block size will grow exponentially.
Seems like a pretty easy attack that can easily be carried out by any state or bank.

Bitcoin's value depends on it's resilience.
With an increased block size, a saboteur could do more harm to the system by generating a lot of transactions.
However, I don't think bandwidth is the most important issue of this debate. (Maybe it was, back when Gavin was proposing block sizes that grow exponentially...)
Even if nobody ever exploits the increased block size attack, the debate itself revealed other flaws with bitcoin that may affect its resilience. The outcome of the debate is a measure of whether those flaws are significant.

I think you missed some of the most important economic points of the debate.
Large blocks show that bitcoin protocol is as sensitive to public hysteria as US monetary policy. Some core developers have made proposals that insert economic attack vectors into the protocol, and argue that we should not consider That Which is Not Seen.
Large blocks demonstrate that the public is willing to fork bitcoin to get lower transaction fees at the expense of the miners that secure the blockchain. The suggests long term instability and misaligned incentives.

I discovered Ripple when I was looking for something similar to what the OP described a while ago. It's kind of a cool "automatic bartering" protocol. But, I ran into too many aspects of the system that I wasn't comfortable with, namely, the special status of XRP.
The more equitable distribution scheme you mention is mining. It's used even by peercoin, which doesn't need mining for securing the network, but does need it for distribution of coins over time.
Developers can implement the ripple protocol (or other exchange protocols) on top of bitcoin. I heard WeExchange (scam) was ripple implementation.
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:08:34
Obviously, this reduces transaction fees as a long-term incentive for mining. As a result, the responsibility of maintaining the integrity of the blockchain will shift from transactors to stakeholders.
It makes more sense for stakeholders to maintain the ledger, but large stakeholders (e.g., bitcoin banks) will have to notice this change and mine.
This flavor of mining is still an oddly inefficient method for PoS...

There is a monetary incentive without mining fees. It's the same incentive that causes banks to hire security guards: they don't want to lose all their money. (If we were to say "whoever brings guns to a bank gets some of the bank's money," that would be like PoW :-)
I didn't say miners aren't stakeholders. I just said that mining fees incentivizes non-stakeholders.

Until recently, you could have said the same about a society with a female head of state.


Groups (like, The Free State Project, Seasteading, and The Advocates for Self-Government) are working on it.


It sounds like you like the scientific method. Whereas democracy turns the status quo into inflexible law, freedom is all about letting people experiment.


I don't believe that "society" owns the land. If a few kids in school make a student government, does that mean they own the school, and it's right for them to do anything they want to the other students?


Well, no. If somebody plants a pretty flower on their property, and I walk by and enjoy it (or don't), then I'm not "very clearly required" to pay them for seeing it. You seem to think that we're the government's subjects / that we exist at the grace of our rules. I think the relationship is more symmetrical than that.


That way is rather uninspired. The Israelis bought the land that is now [Tel Aviv]( from Bedouins in 1909.

Past Performance is Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Results.
Basing something on Moore's "Law", or whatever Gavin's doing, is very shortsighted. The fact that computer / internet technology is advancing at an exponential rate in its infancy does not guarantee (or even suggest) it will always do that.

Even in bitcoin, people with a stake would mine to keep their stake safe (although it's wasteful). Artificial transaction fees make it more difficult to do so. Imagine if the government (or anyone) said that they'll give you 101% of your share of the mining profits. Everyone (without stake) would reasonably jump on the government's pool, and the stakeholders would be screwed. It doesn't seem this would be possible without the incentive of artificial transaction fees.
But yeah, I was eluding to PoS, which doesn't misplace the costs of maintaining the integrity of the blockchain on people other than those with a stake (and doesn't have the waste).

@_date: 2014-01-15 21:48:43
Well, I'm not arguing that if you want to secure the blockchain you should invest in an expensive, inefficient device for doing so! 
The problem is that incentivizing mining with rewards and tx fees disincentives mining to secure the blockchain. For example, the government could start a mining pool and pay out 102% of the money that it mines. GH essentially does that, by subsidizing their pool infrastructure somehow so they can pay out 100%.
If there were no block rewards of tx fees, people would mine only if their behavior produces a benefit, and the only benefit would be securing the blockchain or bribes. Without mining rewards, it would be very expensive for the government or GH to persuade people to mine centrally.
I think the best thing for bitcoin is the eventual reduction in mining rewards and, hopefully, an expansion in the size of a block. It's simpler, but it puts the cost of maintaining the blockchain on the people who need it to be maintained- the stake holders.
Or Peercoin :-)

I don't think accepting double spend transaction would make a miner any money. Wouldn't they just be invalidated by every other miner?
Also, sure, everyone works with their own self-interest in mind, but don't presume you know everyone's subjective values. Many miners aren't stakeholders (a problem that PoS solves), and other miners may want bitcoin to fail.
But, I agree with your point, 0 transactions isn't safe, unless you trust the sender (customer or wallet). Does any reputable wallet service sign their transactions that are "0 confirmation safe" as such?

Yeah, I think "people do" is a pretty good answer. All branches of the federal government derive its power ultimately from the people, albeit with some delay. In many places, the people can also put stuff on the ballet for people to vote on directly. The only things that prevents the people from having total control over everyone's lives is the Constitution, and the ethical boundaries people have.
There is a separation of powers in the U.S., but it's not between the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. It's between the federal government and the Constitution. I think understanding that is more important that knowing who's the current administrative head of the U.S. or the majority leader, and a lot less well known.

It's because people want to be safe and secure, and the only way they know to achieve those things is giving absolute power to a select few.
There is no reason to assume that a better alternative to government (like liberty) won't be realized. Change happens, even after thousands of years without it. For example, there are almost no absolute monarchies left. There are many other examples.
(Just out of curiousity, I think you're the original definition of conservative from the French revolution era, whereas the pro-topplers are the original definition of liberal. How do you identify politically?)
Lastly, I disagree (again) with Gavin. The US Government (and others) draws a tremendous amount of its power from taxes and printing money.

It's a convenient property for $100 today to be worth the same as $100 next year.
It would be interesting for an altcoin to create or destroy the number of underlying units to make the coin worth the same amount over time, but it's prone to manipulation (as is the CPI) and not all that important. People can (and do!) account for change in value of money.
But when the Federal Reserve creates money, you don't get a check every year to compensate. The money is sold as bonds to fund the government and cheaply loaned to banks. So, as the central bank increases currency units, each person has a smaller % of the economy as they had before, and the government (and banks) have a larger % of the economy.


No, you wouldn't get laid off as long as you're bringing net value to the company.

Not true. Without stake, you wouldn't mine if cost + capital &lt; expected block rewards.

Linux distros aren't widely used for user facing applications, not because of fragmentation, but because they're not user friendly. They're used in 98.8% of the TOP500 supercomputers. Mac OS starting becoming popular when OS X came out, which is like a user-friendly Linux distro.
This competition of distros might not be good for any particular Linux distro, but it's great for Linux itself. With the only competition for Windows 7 coming from Windows 8, there will be no way for Windows to remain competitive to Linux / OS X.
This is the same for crypto-currencies. Altcoins might be "bad" for bitcoin, but they're great for crypto-currencies.

The author conflates the French Revolution with democracy, when it was more about liberalism (AKA voluntarism or libertarianism). Then, he says, since bitcoin "requires consent of the governed," it's very democratic. Unfortunately, "requires consent of the governed" is not a property of the tyrany-of-the-majority government.
If you want democratic money - money that can be voted into creation and voted out of your hands - stick with fiat.

That's not all it allows them to do. It allows them to slowly write an alternate history (of valid transactions). That history can include double spending, but it can also undo spending from others. Obviously, the ability to slowly erase bitcoin's history would destroy bitcoin.
Many states with competing currencies and a mandate to control financial transactions would love to have this power to "get a free chai latte."
I think it's still unlikely because of 1 and 2. But there are other approaches a state could take, due to the misaligned incentives in PoW. For example, a state could create a mining pool that gives out 105% of the mining revenue. Then, for only 5% of the rewards cost, they could incentivize a bunch of non-stakeholder miners to mine USG's alternative history.

If I'm transferring my wealth somewhere, I want to be sure it will be secure, unconditionally and forever. With bitcoin, I can always mine to ensure its security, but what prevents bitcoin from being a zero sum game?
Do stakeholders have to spend $10 mining (directly or through fees) to protect $10 of BTC from saboteurs who **will** spend  $9.99 to get $10?
Other currencies don't have this problem. With gold, the owner starts off with a huge defensive advantage over a saboteur. E.g., she can hide it or lock it up. With PoS, the owner gets a defensive advantage mathematically.

I like a lot of the other answers, but let me try to answer why I think "economists" like Paul Krugman hate bitcoin.
Fiat currency is democratic. The people elect people who elect people who appoint people to determine what the monetary policy should be. Politicians can then print money and use it however they'd like or give it to whomever they'd like. This is a very good system when you believe that freedom isn't fair and bureaucrats know how to spend your money better than you do. The most popular economic philosophy, Keynesian economics, is an example of an economic philosophy that relies on government having control of money.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is individualistic. The monetary policy is very resistant to manipulation, and even then, it will result in a fork rather than a majority rules situation. Ownership of bitcoin, as in knowing the private key for public keys with balance, is also very resistant to theft by force. Therefore, bitcoin is sometimes seen as selfish and undemocratic.

2) it takes a majority of private keys to unlock someone's bitcoins

Should we remove the links to Technology too? After all, bitcoin can be used by Luddites.
Keynesian economics believes monetary supply should be manipulated by a authority. I think that the key ideological alternative, Austrian economics, is central to understanding the philosophical underpinnings of bitcoin.
Those that espouse governments believe that, in some circumstances, the individual should be subject to the will of the majority or the dictator. Bitcoin adopts the ideological alternative, libertarianism, that asserts that ownership is absolute.
The moderator should continue to promote the philosophies of bitcoin.
The blockchain is not publicly owned. It is individually owned. Nobody can change your copy against your will. It's just that your copy is only useful when it agrees with others' copies.

Although I agree that mainstreaming is more good than bad, I don’t think you hit the main concerns.
I’m not concerned with trying to talk to regulators. After all, such discussions try to educate regulators about ethical alternatives to force (assuming compromising the protocol is off the table). I think a valid concern, however, is that mainstreaming will result in a majority that think that we should tax transactions, block select transactions, occasionally confiscate coins, only allow transactions from verified bitcoin addresses, etc.
Second, people interested in privacy and censorship are not the only ones with these concerns. Libertarians are concerned more broadly with preventing coercion, and in this case, keeping bitcoin resistant to coercion. I’m surprised they weren’t mentioned in the article as a concerned party.

It won't change the distribution of wealth. The distribution of wealth follows a power law distribution, which arises naturally when new entities are more likely to do business with well connected entities. In the case of the bitcoin world, new merchants are more likely to rely on coinbase than on some newly formed exchange, and as a result, a log number of players will have an exponential amount of wealth.
I'd suggest not worrying about the distribution that arises when a company brings a lot of value to society.

It's a representative democracy. The same as the US. They vote (for people that then vote) to make decisions about what people can and can't do and how they should live.
The only difference is that the U.S. happens to have a constitution written by some freedom-minded people that limits its government's scope. That document is largely ignored now though.
