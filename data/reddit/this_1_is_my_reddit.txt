I'd also like to hard fork some privates if you know what I mean, and I know you do ;)

Holy shit that's amazing -  Can you give me directions to that sidewalk?  I'll wait for it while I type my resignation letter.

But BCash came 100% free-of-charge to many of us... so we want it to MOON baby!

I think you can recover the lost wallet onto a new wallet if lost.  Provided you remember the seed of course.

People need to understand better what you said.  As Alts become mainstream, they will take money away from Bitcoin and slow bitcoin's growth.  Because remember when smartphones first came out and everyone only had a BlackBerry?  Or when cars first came out and everyone only drove Ford? And then what happened?  People moved to alternatives.

This.  I'd be so much richer right now if hadn't listened to mine--  they are simply clueless.

Instead you should have bought a gym membership.  I don't know which is bigger.  His snout or your waistline.

What year/month did you receive that initial lump sum and you could have gone all-in? I'm just trying to figure out at what price you could have bought at.

Everyone else is asking about the app.  But what i want to know is, how will OP recoup his lost salary from quitting his job to make the apps?

Kind of stupid to believe bitcoin can equal fiat adoption anytime soon considering 51% of the world's population has internet access.[1]
And a good chunk of that is blocked. 
Oh and I almost forgot, banks are blocking crypto too.

Good, it gives us more time to accumulate.

You can fuck right off.

By the looks of the chart (great analytic by the way) this time a year is historically high compared to the median.

True. On the other hand, won't people start using a different crypto currency once BTC becomes unattainable?  I'm pro-BTC.  But I'm also pro-diversification.

^ lol most underrated comedic writing style.  Ya glorious bastard...

Yup. I was speaking about 
1) the TRX fees / byt are rising and may be increasing to a point where competing crypto payment methods are preferable 
2) liquidity issues since more people hold than spend, again making competing payment methods preferable
