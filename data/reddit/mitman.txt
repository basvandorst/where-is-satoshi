I would love to collaborate with anyone on this. Primarily iOS, but willing to try mobile/web browser.

Awesome! This is really good news!

Do you know if altcoins can be mined with this?

Thanks. I did not know this. This is exactly what I wanted
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:36:01
Was it your first purchase or is this for everyone who buys after verification?
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:33:30
I did not know that. Exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the info

I'm just bought instantly. Not sure if that's because they got some though.

So if I bought bitcoins before but I just verified my credit card (and have completed all the other things previously) I won't have to wait 30 days?

Do you think the 64 chip is a better buy than the 16 chip? I was considering the 16 chip but I did not consider the return of the 64 chip. By the way I'm I the US.

Really? There isn't any other way? I'd rather not use localbitcoins if possible.

No I was just using Dwolla as an example. I just liked the ease of transferring money to Campbx and from my computer and for a low cost. Those options seem good, I wouldn't mind mailing a money order. Hopefully the ACH deposits with Campbx will work out.
@_date: 2013-09-04 04:39:31
Just did that too and lost all my keys. I actually made a post to r/iphone about this. I am still unable to recover my campbx account.

Can I have a link too please?

Yeah, questions I've asked them more than a week ago are just getting answered now. As far as the refunds go, they gave a very prompt response and refund that took less than a week for me to get money back.
Paypal may be more helpful if you contact them directly. Unless you are out of your 45 day period from when you paid. Then it's very unlikely.

Ah, ok thanks!

Where do you get the 7 gh/s miner?
