Fair point. Didn't mean to imply you were suggesting others bypass taxes.
But point remains that the IRS will 100% be made aware of intentional sub limit transactions and can prove intent if they are frequent enough. So regardless of your intent, that advice should always be coupled with a disclaimer. It is definitely a liability.
Be careful out there ✌️

When you are audited in 5 years and have to explain the deposits into your account from a Cryptocurrency exchange and have to provide records they can trace the wallet you claimed was stolen to the one you are using and you will be arrested.
Don't forget, you are attempting to operate a financial scheme on a public ledger. 
Good luck.

You set a %. So if you have a 5% trailing stop loss, it adjusts upwards based on current price. If the price dips 5% from whatever its current price is, you are liquidated.
It only adjusts upwards. So your losses are capped but your gains are not.
Also this post has nothing to do with bitcoin. Fuggin pips.

That would be weird because it wouldn't make any sense.
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:32:36
I mean. I think that goes without saying.
The point for me is, if the value of my fiat is declining and my expenses remain the same, why wouldn't I put my fiat into an asset that is rising and exchange for more fiat when I need it?
Thats not a new concept. The real question is, will bitcoin behave like gold? I personally see more evidence that it will than not.
But I still think it will be a volatile ride. Not implying it will stabilize. And that may be a deterrent. Only time will tell.

You seem to lack a basic grasp on how interpretation works. 
You also care way too much about this conversation. You clearly need to feel like you're in control. Reddit seems to be one of your outlets.
I understand your frustration and I sympathize for your need to be heard. Everyone is nodding at you. You are perpetually right in everything you do and say. And now, you are recognized. 
Thank you for your wisdom.
@_date: 2019-08-17 00:10:13
Imagine your fiat was declining due to the actions of regulation and government oversight. What options do you have as a hedge?
Seems like a decentralized store of value, immune to corruption, might have some real value in that scenario. 
It does for me. So. That's where I'm at. We will see what the rest of the world decides when it happens.

"one morning you wake up"
Do you think that if you're alive in the future that, on that morning, you will, in fact, wake up?
This doesnt imply immediacy. If OP wanted to convey it happened overnight he would have assigned a timeframe. "Tomorrow you wake up" , "all the sudden" etc. 
"One morning you wake up" is reasonably interpreted as a future scenario IMO.
But thanks for your insight.

I think this price Target may be past but who knows. Btc can pullback in a bull market by 30%. So it's possible. But it seems there is a buy wall set around $7500. That can change of course. But I am thinking a trend of higher lows may continue.
Then again, nobody knows.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:27:20
These are examples of correlations. Not causation. You can overlay charts of alts against bitcoin that demonstrate identical trends.
Coorelation could also be related to increased demand for liquidity due to increased demand for underlying assets tether is used to purchase.
Google trends have nothing to do with tether. That is an example of a+b=D. There could be multiple alternative explanations for increased btc price with lower search volume. For example, people who researched prior are back in, institutions are largely responsible for this run, etc. Jumping to tether manipulation is a stretch of a conclusion because there isn't a dot that connects you there.
Sorry, but all still speculative conclusions. You can read anything you want to when you look at a chart. It doesn't tell you what happened. Only that something happened.

not trying to "nickel and dime" here but this is a misnomer. 1970 price of gold was $240 (adjusted for today's dollar that's appx $1650), in1980 gold reached $2,156 (in today's dollars that's appx $6500), so in that decade you would have done extremely well. There were other opportunities to profit. But that's a decade of solid gains right there.

Anyway, I love free money. I'll bet you trump is impeached by the house. $25 real world dollars.
 When I win, you have to pay in bitcoin
You also have to post in r/trump and attempt to do an AMA as a former Hannity groupie turned full Dem. You have to tell a convincing story about how Hannity kicked your dog when you finally had the chance to meet him because he said you smelled like an "undercover lib". We can cover more on the details of the story when it's time for you to post.
