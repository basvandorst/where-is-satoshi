Smells like government, outsourcing to the wonderful people of this nation!

Would this be due to the yahoo mining maleware?

No, no, no. Don't do it XD. Honestly I would hold out on bitcoins until the USA figures out taxes on them. Currently they could come back and audit everyone who has bought into bitcoin when they make tax policies. Unless you are not from the USA, then regional taxes will apply to you, and I hope you know them.

I said that because of an earlier post about taxation on bitcoin and that every purchase you make with btc, you technically have ot file a separate 1099 because you are swapping investments. Right now btc is a very grey area with taxation.

Of course, but I was just making a generalized comment on how hdds work. Yeah that one is fucked XD

Its actually very simple. When you delete something off of a harddrive. Essentially it just deletes where the harddrive can  look it up at. You technically aren't deleting anything until the hdd writes over the files where bitcoins were at. If you run a recovery tool (Recuva from Piriform) you may be able to find those lost tracks holding the wallet. I think that is what he is referring to in this picture.
