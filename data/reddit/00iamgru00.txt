Do you have an argument that proves that they will?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:07:52
I wouldn’t say it’s seperate from the Bitcoin Network, but on top of the Bitcoin network.
All transaction are not logged on the Bitcoin Network. Only the sum of those transactions when the channel is closed. 
That’s why it’s an effective scaling solution, because it removes the need to record every little transaction on the Blockchain. 
If you want to get right into the technicals of it, check out the [white paper](
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:08:55
Why does it need to be perfectly analogised to an existing system? 
LN is a whole new technology that has no known equal. Can’t we just enjoy it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:21:24
Your channel can stay open for as long as you want. A week, a year. If the channel is closed prematurely by the other person, then your balance in the channel goes back to you.
Payments take seconds so chances of them closing during a payment are insignificant.
There’s a feature built into the system, so if someone try’s to dishonestly remove funds that aren’t theirs, then the Lightning channel will close, and ALL the funds in the channel will go to the other person. 
You will likely be able to choose your route and fee. I don’t think it’s plan is to be used for large transactions anyway, it’s mostly for the littler stuff, that is pointless to have written into the Blockchain forever and ever.

Well that video is the BitcoinCash equivalent.
It’s mostly lies or half truths, aimed at newcomers who don’t know what to believe.

LN is second layer. It works on top of the Bitcoin Network. 
LN balances are always still valid on the Bitcoin Blockchain, and your LN channel can be closed at any time by either party and the balance is available on the Bitcoin Network.
There are already several working implementations in use on the testnet, and they are working towards creating a compatibility standard.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:13:55
3)Lightning Network is a Network of all users on the Network. If you have a LN wallet, you are a node. 
It is the opposite of centralised.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:34:14
What is a point the video made that you’d like explained?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:22:53
You can charge a fee if you want! But there will be thousands of ways to route around your node and choose a cheaper way, so fees are expected to be cents or less
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:56:50
Transactions will use onion routing, which means a node will only know the node directly before and after it in a routing chain. It does not know if those nodes are the the originator of the transaction or the receiver either.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:45:30
You are a node if you have a wallet. You can route other people’s transactions too. 
Third party here means you can route a transaction through someone else’s node to reach a person you don’t have a direct channel with.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:12:15
2) “withdrawing” or closing your channel, is a normal bitcoin on-chain transaction. The fee will be whatever fee you set, just like for a transaction now
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:47:48
If the majority of transactions are happening off chain, what is your reasoning behind the onchain fees being the same as they are now?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:24:45
No they just need to open a channel with someone on the Network. Then they are discoverable by anyone connected to that person, and everyone connected to them, and everyone connected to them, and everyone....     you get the point.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:51:30
But every time one of the BCH shills uses an over simplified contrived metaphor it’s just play on?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:01:51
No specialised Hardware is required to run a LN node. You can run it on your laptop.
I’d say that this claim by the BCH crowd, is just a throw off, to distract from the fact that using big blocks on the Blockchain (like they are) WILL have a centralising effect, as that is what will require exactly those things you mention. 
And on a side note, the reason most people won’t bother getting into these discussions anymore is because 90% of the pro-BCH are trolls and fake accounts. They are not after discussion, they just want to spew their lies at you. 
So the simplest approach is to not feed the trolls.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:54
1) There is no “they” in the Lightning Network. You send a normal transaction to “your” LN wallet(node).
You transact with your bitcoin via [hashed timelock contracts](  with other users through the LN. 
You can close your channel at any time with a normal transaction on the Bitcoin Blockchain, and you will receive the balance of your LN channel.
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:28:48
If you have the private key for a BCH address, you already own the BTC address anyway.

Your wallet may generate a new address for every transaction, but you can use any address it has generated as much as you want.
Your wallet controls all the addresses it generates.

You will be able to literally directly open a payment channel with someone. That's as far from centralisation as there is!
But to save you from opening a channel with every person you transact with, you will be able to route your transaction through other nodes in a "6 degrees of seperation" type of way. 
This will probably give way to nodes which are large hubs, to help with keeping everyone closer together. Ie. less nodes your transaction needs to go through, meaning less fees.
However unlike mining, the barrier to entry for running a node is nonexistent. Anyone can run a node, no expensive equipment needed.
You will probably be able to select the path of your transaction also if you want to avoid large hubs, although it would mean more steps and more fees.
It's interesting stuff. Will be much to learn in the coming weeks.

@_date: 2017-08-10 02:00:13
Looking at your diagram, you could have ONLY one channel opened to any merchant on that list, and you would still be able to pay ANY other merchant there. 
Your payment would be able to route to any of those merchants because there is a connection between all of them. 
Having MORE connections means that you will be able to find a shorter route to your destination, and means you will pay less fees.
Each node will likely be able to set their own fees, and your client will automatically find the cheapest route to your payment destination.
Also, fees on lightning network are expected to be small. Likely in the range of cents for a transaction, so deciding on a routing probably won't be a consideration because you are talking about cents either way.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:45:47
Actually transaction is instant, confirmation is ~14mins, and can't be reversed when confirmed. 
Lots of people have have payments reversed away from them with PayPal!
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:37:42
A cup of coffee isn't 4,300 bucks though. If you WERE buying a cup of coffee it would be one input and 2 outputs and the fees would be a hell of a lot lower. 
$7 out of $4300 is not bad. The price of Bitcoin has fluctuated over a hundred bucks during today alone anyway. 
In the scheme of things, $7 and a Bitcoin is a non-issue.

(Sorry forgot all your questions and I'm on a mobile)
You will pay a miner fee to open a channel(sending funds from on chain to lock up for your LN channel)
And you'll pay a miner fee when you close you LN channel(sending your funds from your LN channel back to your on-chain account)
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:08:03
Segwit is a scaling solution.
2nd layer networks are a scaling solution.
Hypotheticals about $1000 transaction fees are moot since if that ever was the case in the future, $1000 would be worth about as much as a cup of coffee.
Interesting that you wanted to know the answer to a question, but then you have a very biased retort to every comment.

The problem is you are comparing 2 different metrics. If it's confirmation, then Bitcoin is ~14mins and PayPal is 6 months.
You've got a problem with exchanges wanting 6 confirmations? Make a meme about that!
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:11:56
Yes but YOU get to decide to give a refund. It's not possible for a 3rd party to decide and take it from you.
As a Bitcoin merchant you can decide to have 0-confirmation purchases and your 'risk to be reversed' is only 14 minutes!
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:39:14
$100 to send $10? I think you're setting your fees too high guy.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:35:46
You and I have different ideas about what 'doubts raised' mean.
Businesses want to test there systems to make sure they work correctly with segwit. That is a very normal and smart thing to do.
Segwit is safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:36:45
If you have opened a channel with someone who is connected to someone else, then you are also already connected to both of them. 
If that person then has a channel open with a couple of people, then YOU are also connected to them. 
You don't need to open a channel with each person. Your transaction will find a path if there is one.
For the transaction cost of opening 1 LN channel, you can potentially pay, or be paid by ANY person on the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:56:05

The fees will be whatever people are willing to pay. For the most part they don’t need to be very high right now either, but people don’t really know what they are doing, and lots of wallets either have poor fee estimation, or they don’t allow custom fees.
I doubt the masses are dumb enough to keep arbitrarily pushing fees to the extent you’re talking about though.
It will just take a while for everyone to get used to the idea that satoshis are worth a lot more now than they used to be. For example a 100sat/byte fee now and a 50sat/byte fee sometime in the near future will be the same value.
The miners are loving life right now because this fact hasn’t caught up with reality yet for most people, they just keep pushing 100-200-300 sat/byte fees because that’s what they did last month. 
Everything will work itself out. Eventually.

Thanks. It looks like custom fee settings are a known issue on coinomi 
60sats/kb is way too low. That's practically 0. It should be 60sats/b. 
That wallet probably doesn't allow 0 fee transactions so defaulted to something higher(200sats/b)
That's my guess anyway,

The system is smarter than you realise. If lots of miners stop mining, then the mining difficulty will automatically adjust down to compensate, which will make mining more profitable for the remaining miners, which will incentivise more people to mine.

I don’t think any body is really against a 2mb upgrade if and when it’s needed. 
The 2x movement is more politically motivated, than it is technically motivated though. 
I think the main reason some people want it is that it will remove the core team from being in control of the reference client code. 
The problem is that the btc1(2x) code was copy/pasted from core’s code with a minor change. There is really only 1 developer doing anything with it and from some reports a bit of an incompetent one. 
There is little to no activity or contributions happening with the btc1 code, and if there is, it is happening privately, behind closed doors. 
In contrast the core code is open source, has MANY contributors and is actively and openly peer reviewed. Also Bitcoin adoption and price is the highest its ever been. 
Seems to me that those guys know what they’re doing.
