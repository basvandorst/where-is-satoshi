Clearly, you don't care about others' opinion. As you said, you have been brainwashed. What is worse is that you can't understand basic things well.
Then no wonder you support BU &amp; Roger Ver, and no wonder you denounce Bitcoin dev "they hate Satoshi". You think Wright, that "fuck off, fuck off, fuck off" guy, is Satoshi. Anyone who laughed at Wright will be denounced by you as "he hates Satoshi".
Either your logic is messy, or you are one of the paid shills employed by Roger Ver.
If your logic is messy, I suggest you rethink and be open-minded. Many people could be stupid for a long time, but you shall change it after reading more and more evidence.
If you are a paid shill, like infamous r/btc moderator BitcoinXio, then I hope you could ask yourself a question: Which is more important, money or conscience?

I respect your view. But let's pay a little attention to the reality.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:19:32
Hard Fork is easy but very very risky. Do you think so? Most anti-core buddies think it's easy but don't know it's risky.
The more you cherish Bitcoin, the harder you will make a decision to do things that are 50% risky 50% good.
Some people don't care about Bitcoin's future. They think the price can go to $10k fast if the result is good, will be zero if there is a failure. So the expectation value is $5k, which is much better than it's now.
But Bitcoin lovers are not willing to choose this way. Because we don't want Bitcoin to fail. We would rather wait until we find a safer way.
Core devs think the current problem can be solved by soft fork, which is less risky. Even BU Roger Ver Chinese big miners admit SegWit is good but refuse to activate it now.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:06:44
That's exactly what I think.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:42:51
Popularity amongst miners does not mean popularity amongst Bitcoiners
Breadwallet does not understand how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:41:45
I suggest you to try to have less hatred and be more inclusive. It's not right to throw "hostile" to Core devs who contributed so much to Bitcoin. Core devs are not alone. To me, Gavin lost his credibility when he insisted Wraight was Satoshi. He insisted he's right when most of the community said NO. Similar situation as now.
Also, if you are familiar with history, you will know why Satoshi disappeared. And then you would not have used Gavin to be any proof. 
Roger Ver lost his credibility to most early adopters after he said mtgox ran well, which was proven to be a serious mistake if we don't call it a lie.
Calm down, don't hide facts yourself. Have you downloaded Core's Bitcoin software? If not yet, you can take a look at its name. Denouncing Core devs without any evidence won't help you at all.
As for me, Core devs were and are qualified to the task.
Also, it seems you don't even know how Bitcoin core runs. If you have a brilliant idea and be qualified in coding, you can become a core.
I suggest you take a look at this picture: 
Then you will know who loves Satoshi and Bitcoin, who is a liar.

No, I don't think so. 
In China, most big miners (5-10 groups) are angry toward Core. Some of them think that miners are the only say. But it's not important.
My assumption is, F2pool does not want to stand with either side. They only want to be a quiet pool. After the failure to persuade Jihan and signal SW on LTC, F2pool realized that he is in the risk of Incurring outrage from most big Chinese miner groups (Yes that's the status quo). So they twittered to express they are not standing on any side. 
That's my assumption. Maybe it's wrong. But I think it's possible.
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:23:11


That's not how it runs.
The block reward was not meant to be 50 btc per block just because it was set as 50btc at the beginning. it's a ridiculous logic.
If you think your logic is right, why do you support SW, which will actually lift capacity 2X, so your "smoothly replace" won't work, but you still support it?
The 1mb limit was set temporarily by Satoshi **only for improving user experience**, which was expressed clearly by Satoshi. When the user experience is hurt by unnecessarily high fee and confirmation time so apparently, there is no reason to keep the limit.
@_date: 2017-04-08 03:37:11

@_date: 2017-04-30 07:30:24
It's certainly a pleasure to see so many new techs coming thanks to Core devs' intelligence and contribution, but where is the Blockchain tech? Blockchain tech can scale, and Bitcoin is based on Blockchain.
At this stage of Bitcoin, Blockchain tech itself can adjust to make the situation of fee/confirmation time quite good. 
SW(2X) as a softfork may be better to be implemented before hard fork, that's certainly okay. But after SW, block size increase is still needed, given that the average block size has been already 0.96mb for a long time.
Such a BIP needs at least 6 months to be tested, commented, voted, and activated, let alone the fact that there is no such BIP in the past 16 months and some vocal core devs expressed the opinion that they will never support larger block size unless "emergency situation" that will never exist occurs.


Theoretically, even with the concern that devs will no longer support larger block size, miners shall not delay SW "now" and it's clear that miners actually want SW because it's good tech. That's called "if you don't want blockchain based Bitcoin to work, then I don't want your new tech to work." 
But, it's understandable. And it's how the real society runs.

They don't know the relation between SegWit and Block limit.
The name of SegWit is too difficult for them to understand.
@_date: 2017-04-14 15:00:47
If we don't talk about the risk, then both BU and SegWit can improve onchain transaction capacity and thus can lower the transaction fee to nearly zero in short term. 
If you look forward to longer future, then the nearly zero fee period will last shorter (*1 .may be longer) time for SegWit. If needed, we can lift the limit so the fee is still zero in the longer future.
For everyday bitcoin user, SegWit has a well known advantage that it allows LN thus everyday bitcoin user can transfer bitcoin instantly (no need to wait for confirms) and the fee is nearly zero.
*1, if most people use LN, then that period will be longer. And may be forever.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:38:19

@_date: 2017-04-30 11:57:26
Its not 'how much', instead its 'do or not do'. Thats the reason why it becomes so controversial, even when there is a tradition that most users follow leading devs group no matter whatever they do. For example, if vocal core devs say 'We certainly will propose to increase block size (after SW) when the average fee is above $0.1 for X blocks and there is no sign for the fee to decrease soon', then SW will be welcome by miners immediately.
But if vocal devs only say ' we will increase block size only in 'emergency situation'.', that means they will never increase the block size.
If devs want to introduce new tech, they shall at least let blockchain tech compete fairly with the new tech first. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:16:04
Thank you for describing yourself.
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:47:00

The fee is high, but this high is unnecessary.
To process transactions, miners already get 12.5 btc block reward. And the last coin will be minted in 2140.

"archiving" and "spamming" was a "burden" since day 1, but back then, people still think Bitcoin to be viable because this burden is worthy and acceptable.
if you think other solutions are better, then it's okay. But on-chain transaction capacity shall continue to be enough. It couldn't be **unnecessarily** expensive.
If you think it's a burden and Ln is enough, why not decrease it to 0.01mb? Then people can run full nodes on billions of cellphones.

Luke opposes any blocksize increase unless "emergency situations", which certainly will never exist. Or "overwhelming consensus", which also will never exist unless leading Core devs support it. 


Sounds good. But too many proofs imply thats not the fact.
Even if we increase block size too early, and after 2nd layer, we find it's too large, we also can decrease it in the future.  There is no excuse to refuse block size increase limit so firmly. It's not reasonable.

Jihan is the boss of Jiang zhuoer. And Jiang is Jihan's right-arm man.
From this article you may feel that Jihan and his mates may support SegWit in the future. I want to clarify this won't happen.
Jihan and his mates attack SegWit very hard in China, but sometimes he also tells foreigners that he doesn't oppose SegWit. It's very interesting. But it does not seem to be for greater goodness of Bitcoin.
Jihan and his mates spammed many lies to attack Devs. It doesn't seem to be good will.
Jihan and his mates claimed "the market drives changes" to imply that the market supports them to fool newbies. By such lies Jihan hopes he could drive the market to change. When the market support SegWit so apparently and they oppose SegWit so firmly without any reasonable explanation, such lies are so ridiculous.
Clearly, Jihan and his mates' interest is not in the price of Bitcoin, but in the centralization of Mining rigs, which he admitted.
Personally speaking, I think UASF based on 51% hashrate is our only choice.
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:55:15

I urge miners to activate SW now.
But in their mind, it's clear core devs will not lift the limit in the future. And without the support of core devs, no one can gain "overwhelming consensus" to make such change. So miners and many people want core devs to explicitly express the attitude to increase block size to lower the fee. What core devs is willing to give is only perfunctory explanation.
Miners do wrong, but that makes Core devs correct.

1. Bitcoin hash rate is much more directly correlated to the price. That's the reason why miners dislike the unnecessarily high fee now.
2. Every person eventually dies, but that's not the excuse that he shall not struggle to live now.
3. What?
4. Sorting what issue? I certainly want SW first. 
relatively small? 2mb 4mb is still relatively small.
Currently, there is no real reason to stop further on-chain solutions beyond SW, but the philosophy in some leading devs' mind.
@_date: 2017-04-20 04:51:46


I think, UASF need to be based on 51% hashrate support in soft fork, or one-chain hard fork.
For 2-chains fork, hashrate has no say. Because after forking, each chain will have majority hashrate support.
TBH, It's  nearly impossible for Bitcoin to 2-chains fork this time, even though Bitmain threatened to do so many times.

For example, if there is no solution such as SW to increase capacity, the situations in the past 12 months can be definitely seen as "necessary”. Now that we have a tested, soft-fork solution as SW, we certainly shall use SW first.
But, the bad fact is that some devs clearly showed that they won't support lifting the capacity limit even when there is no other way. Such irrational attitude makes them another BU.
The worst thing is that nearly no core dev dares to see "bigger block" as a considerable option after SW when "necessary", while the only voice from some devs are "keep 1mb limit permanently".
Such as this one. 
We shall be quite careful when such irrational attitude is the only attitude expressed from devs.

I beg to differ. One miner can be easily to corrupt, but majority miners can't be corrupted easily. It's why market economy is much better than planned economy.


making. 
It's written in bitcoin paper. 
It tells us a way to make decision on decentralized network.


Users don't "have to". But the "can". 
Anyway, devs are not the only say. Satoshi left Bitcoin to ours, not only devs.


Yes miners abused their power. But, it's understandable.
Because, many clues from some devs implied that there will never be any limit increase. For example, u/luke-jr
Although it's only personal opinion, but to be honest, it can impact much more than personal opinion.
Actually, the reason people were angry with those BIG miners were their insanity. If miners get sane, then the situation for some devs will become harder.
It's already been express explicitly that most users want to increase the limit in the near future, from various polls.
Edit: typo.

We know that. But Bitmain keeps speaking in that way to imply that SegWit can't do on-chain scaling.  (Bitmain certainly knows it can)
Actually, it's only an excuse.  If this excuse was debunked to all, Bitmain would speak with another excuse to make them appear to be not too bad.
I don't think most of their customers care about what SegWit is. The soaring or plunging at price will not directly make them support or oppose anything, in my opinion. 、


I think so. But UASF is risky if we don't have overwhelming support. For example, I don't think Kraken will support us. And they will have a bunch of excuses.

Yes, users are most important, and the centralization of mining rigs in absolutism country is not acceptable. But, I don't think the current situation is severe enough.

I'd like to underline that currently (and even if any controversial split occurs) ~50% hashrate supports Core, so it's not 20 - 80. Although Jihan produces 70% of mining rigs. 
Unless China Gov talks with all Chinese pools. Like they did on exchanges.
If so, then there may be 20- 80, or 30 - 70.
In China, Gov can do anything, with or without law. China Gov have forbidden users to withdraw their btc for 70 days, no one dare to do anything to oppose. Only a small amount of people groan about it online.

And the more important thing is that this high fee is not necessary. It's not the thing to maintain the working of the network. It's artificial. It's a distorted fee.
And this fee prevented the usage of Bitcoin. Bitcoin, as a kind of money, it needs circulation. No money becomes money without broad circulation.

Actually, the controversy is not on SW, but on whether we shall give up blockchain tech.
Some people think blockchain tech is not good enough, so they want to introduce new techs like SW and make the main chain as a symbol. That's called New version, or New tech based Bitcoin. These people see main chain as a burden. They like the small block for whatever reason. For example, Luke firmly believes any block size larger than 300kb is unsustainable. But he supports SW although SW will make the block as large as 4mb. 
Some other people also like new techs like SW. But they believe that the blockchain tech itself can adjust to scale to solve the problem. These people see the main chain as the spirit of Bitcoin. **That's called Satoshi's version, or blockchain tech based Bitcoin**.

Miners are not only paid workers, it's also a power that users can use to express opinons. Bitcoin as a money network is too important that it can't be full relied on the devs. Powers need to be balanced. Or we will only have another FED.

You are certainly welcome to propose new techs, but Bitcoin is blockchain tech based bitcoin.
If you want to change Satoshi's vision to your vision, you have a very very long way to go before making arguments.
Changing Satoshi's vision without consensus is unacceptable. This consensus shall be the community consensus, not the eight experts consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:55:33
If you think Bitcoin is nothing but a famous name, then you are wrong.
Bitcoin is blockchain tech based. Bitcoin was proposed by Satoshi. If you want another version, you must firstly prove it. It's not acceptable to tell us "blockchain tech is obsolete, only new Techs can work" without a reasonable explanation, especially when blockchain tech can adjust to works pretty well.

If you can assert Jihan Wu controlling Bitcoin makes sense, then there is no excuse to oppose the latter one. If you think conspiracy is bad, then there is no excuse to approve another conspiracy. Especially when there is already no risk of splitting from miners.
As theymos said, blocklimit lift was basically objected by those eight experts. That's the root of the problem. Many others oppose limit lift mainly because those eight experts oppose it.
Moreover, although apparently, it has gained the consensus among them, it did and does not gain any consensus among the community. Too many Bitcoiners oppose their decision to make Bitcoin a settlement layer. It completely contradicts to Satoshi's vision.
Don't say that things have changed. What things have changed? I don't think so.

If you say "now", then blockchain scaling can solve the problem "now".
The so-called explanation why main chain only can be settle layer relied on the imaginary hypothesis that main chain can not process extremely huge transactions in the future. But as you admitted that no one can see the future, then actually that explanation is only "main chain can't process the huge transactions" "now" "in current situation".
"We can't scale to 10GB now " is not a reasonable explanation why we can't scale to "2mb" 4mb" "10mb" now.
It cant be said so firmly that we can't scale to 10GB in the future, let alone the possibility there will be better techs. It's annoying to dismiss blockchain scalling before its potential has been exhausted.




So many people don't think it's true now. That's why so many people refuse to follow Core devs, even when there was a tradition to follow them and we followed them each time.

Conversely, they only gave perfunctory explanations.
One of the so-called explanations why main chain only can be settle layer relied on the imaginary hypothesis that main chain can not process extremely huge transactions **in the future**. But as no one can see the future, then actually that explanation is only "main chain can't process the huge transactions" **now "in current situation"**.
Their logic is, now that we can't scale to 10Gb **now**, so that we can't scale to **2, 4 or 10mb**.
But if you tell them that SW will make the block be up to 4mb, they will forget their previous warning "average joe can't run whole nodes eaily, oops"
If you tell them Satoshi expected it will be merchants/service providers running nodes gradually, they will tell you "Satoshi made so many mistakes." "Situation has changed so much, Satoshi can't see what we can see now." Changed what? See what?  Actually some core devs no only believe they can see more things that we can't see, but also they feel they have the only say and what they do can always represent majority users. **If the users don't follow them, then they are either not users, or not fully informed (brainwashed).**
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:28:12
Satoshi set the 1mb limit solely for improving the user experience when everyone had to run the whole node to becomes a Bitcoin user.
It's clearly expressed by Satoshi that this limit is only temporarily. But 8 years have passed.
User experience? User experience is being hurt very much by high fee and unexpected confirmation time.

Just as Andreas said, 


@_date: 2017-05-03 00:27:04
Blocklimit was expected to be lifted when it was implemented, so "increase blocklimit" is a default option before current leading core devs gain consensus, which they clearly will never gain.
We don't need perfunctory explanations and various excuses to rationalized their decision. They can't change the expected things without consensus.
Clearly, you want to follow devs only because you think those leading devs know better than you. But as for me, Satoshi knew better than them. 
They kept saying "Satoshi was wrong, wrong, wrong". I don't think so.

In Bitcoin, majority means 95% exactly. There is always an inertia for people to follow leading devs, no matter what they do.
Limiting the usage of main chain with 1mb limit after 8 years is not an action to remain Satoshi's vision. It was expected to be lifted.
New techs are welcome, but you shall let Blockchain tech compete with the new tech fairly before you assert main chain can't scale and can only be settlement layer.
Fees as much as dollars is not seen as an issue we shall care by leading devs. And it's pretty much obvious they won't see it an issue even when the fee becomes hundreds of dollars. It can't be seen "remain Satoshi's vision".
Is there any consensus to change Satoshi's version? Certainly not, or as you said "contention". But leading devs still do.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:46:12

What you wanted to express is that only your things are the purpose of Bitcoin, others not.

Thats the issue.
Why not prepare an alternative solution such as blocklimit increase? They needn't release it for vote, just prepare it in case SW/LN do not work well or enough. It's obvious that leading core devs refuse any related proposal even talks.
No one can be sure it will work well or enough practically. So, why only say "we only have one shot" and refuse any other opinion but their own opinion? Why expel all other people from Core who have the different opinion?
Why only give us one solution and tell us you only can choose whether or not to accept this one? And if we don't accept it, then we are called "informed" (unbrainwashed).
Leading Core devs failed to show any sincerity. I don't think such attitude is beneficial.
You can look at my post history in past weeks. I want this community to be unified and I still strongly oppose BU. But We can't connive any people to control Bitcoin via our fear of not keeping the community unified.
Techs are usually good, People who can code quite well and propose new tech are usually good. But they are not always good to society, or there will be no the term of "technocracy".

inevitable in nonexistent situations is nothing but "never".


But they do consider "fee market" a good idea now, although neither miners nor users want it. So who they build the fee market for?


Such tricks. No one has seen "community". There are only many persons.
When so many people require blocklimit lift, and the real opposing voice is coming from the Core. It can't be seen as that the Core is listening to users. 
So they are building the fee market for "community", which neither miners nor users and service providers are belonging to.
Edit: typo.
@_date: 2017-05-01 04:55:58
If we can safely SegWit now, why can't we do further on-chain scaling after SW? The problems you referred aren't related to your conclusion that we can't do further on-chain scaling now.
Satoshi was not a very good software developer, and Bitcoin is far more than software.


Even miners like SW, as I said before.
The problem is that they are worried that Core devs won't do any further on-chain scaling, no matter how unnecessarily high the fee is. "if you don't want blockchain based Bitcoin to work, then I don't want your new tech to work."
A large portion of users will always follow leading dev group, no matter what they do. And that reality does not make Core devs correct. If you can't see the people who disagree with Core devs on this issue, then no one can help you.
@_date: 2017-05-03 02:25:23


Current leading devs deliberately try to replace blockchain tech based Bitcoin by new Techs based Bitcoin. So if you want to follow them, there is no need for you to understand Blockchain.
Many people disagree with that change. Perhaps more percentage than you see. However, some currently leading devs stealthily encourage a so-called UASF to give devs the only say, although they publicly denied it. 
If you can visit twitter and some other sites, you can easily see they were, are doing it although publicly they denied it.
Keep in mind that people who have the best code skill are not necessarily being good to the society, or there will not be the term of "technocracy".

Bitcoin is p2p cash. The fee is already unnecessarily higher and higher, and you said "no need".

@_date: 2017-05-02 06:08:58
There are much more than 5% of the community who don't want to activate SW without Core devs changing their attitude of making the main chain as useless as settlement layer.
If it becomes more clear that leading core devs insist that there will never be bigger block, I would rather not activate SW.
SW + permanent 1mb block will completely replace Satoshi's vision with current leading devs' vision. 
What I love is the new techs build on Satoshi's vision.
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:35:50


In the era of Satoshi, no one believed this limit would be permanent. Why suddenly it becomes a golden rule without any reasonable explanation but because you think so? Its so ridiculous.


Satoshi did not think so. And Bitcoin was proposed and accepted because it's possible to scale and process huge amount of transactions.
If you think you are cleaver and it's impossible, then it's okay to introduce new techs. But please let Blockchain tech competes fairly with those new techs first.


I dont think you care about centralization. The new techs you introduced will result in more centralization inevitably. 
But you don't care about it. 
Such burden was discussed by Satoshi and early bitcoiners detailedly, and no person thought it's a risk to decentralization.
Concerning on centralization is only a perfunctory excuse. Core devs don't threaten users with "centralization“ risk when they introduce SW. Why does it become a critical issue for blockchain scaling?


valuable? miners get 12.5 block reward, that's certainly valuable.
scarce? Certainly everything is scarce. Food is scarce. But that does not mean people shall not have food.
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:01:36
I really appreciate what you think, although I no longer think so. And I hope you can understand why I changed my mind.
From 2009, we all knew main chain itself can scale, and years later we found a new tech that might also work and might work better. But we must admit that no one can be 100% sure whether the new tech will work practically. Even if it works, no one knows to what extent it will be.
So, the normal way shall be always having the way of main chain scaling as a prepared back up, and then try new techs. And if the new techs don't work, we still have the back up to use. 
Yes, it may not be prepared well, but at least we shall try our best to prepare it.
That's the normal way. But Core devs choose a weird way.
It's pretty obvious they don't prepare it all. And I think its pretty obvious that they will try to find new ways if SW Ln fails or can't help enough, but they refuse any proposal about main chain scaling.
It's weird, especially when more and more people pay attention to blockchain tech, that they try to replace blockchain tech based Bitcoin with new techs based Bitcoin. Worse, they even don't want to give blockchain tech a chance to compete with their new tech fairly.
Edit: typos
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:54:16
"failed" does not mean that Core devs were correct.
Miners and users followed Core each time, but the fact this time is that miners and many users are not willing to follow Core.
There will be no "overwhelming consensus" without the support of leading Core devs, and vocal core devs clearly expressed their attitude to not increase blocklimit. 
So it's not strange that the miners don't activate SW although they like it.
"if you don't want blockchain based Bitcoin to work, then I don't want your new tech to work."
SW won't activate. Bitcoin does not need a tyrant, whether it's called Core or miners or anything. Core may had an illusion that it had the only say because everyone followed it every time. But soon Core will realize that what people follow is anything good for the further success of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:50:37
If you agree on "Nobody can predict the future", why do you so firmly believe that main chain only can be settle layer? Why do you want to make so important decisions for the future people who will have A LOT MORE DATA and A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE than now exists?
