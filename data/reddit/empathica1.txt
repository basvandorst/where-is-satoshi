If tether was telling the truth about their printing policies, there will be no effect. If they weren't, then they just printed millions of dollars out of thin air to buy bitcoin, which artificially increased the price.

Wages dont get adjusted that often, and yeah, nobody will like getting a pay cut, that's one reason why deflation would lead to higher real wages. Right now, retail prices, which do get adjusted often, go up and up, and people really dont like it. Meanwhile, wages fail to keep up with inflation, because employers dont like giving out raises to everybody, meaning that everyone's real incomes plummet.
Right now, the two richest regions in the country are Washington DC and New York City. The former being the place that spend trillions of dollars of inflated money and the latter being the place that receives the inflated money. This redistribution of wealth from everybody to the wealthy elite with political connections, especially the banks, is driving much of today's social and political issues.
It's possible that inflation could be good for the economy. Maybe the people that wealth gets redistributed to do a better job of growing the economy than the people who originally held the wealth. That's what your "wealth gets forced into production" idea relies on. I see no reason why you would expect that to be the case, and I dont think it's so absolutely certain that you can directly make most Americans poorer and have the indirect effects more than compensate.

That has nothing to do with the IRS or the military. You said that the dollar has value because people have to pay their taxes in dollars and America has a large military. 
Also, every failed fiat currency had a government influencing its rate of inflation. Why didnt the value of the mark go up by a factor of a thousand during the weimar republic after it fell by a factor of a million? Why didnt the value get bid up when it fell by a factor of 100 billion? If the value of gold fell by a factor of 100 billion, homeless people would sleep on gold plated benches, watching gold plated cars drive by, all these people buying gold would bid the price up. But marks werent worth the paper they were printed on, and nobody bid up the price of them.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:07:04
I steelmanned your position. Name one person who says that the dollar has value because it's hard to counterfeit physical dollar bills. People say it is backed by government force in some nebulous fashion, like you did in this very comment.
If they found a ton of gold somewhere, or people stopped liking jewelry, the value that gold could drop to would change. If the value of silver dropped to zero, people would go crazy replacing their copper wiring with silver wiring. Gold just happens to be less useful than silver. This effect is what backs commodity money. You can say that this effect is kind of pointless, because nobody buys gold going "man, I hope people like jewelry in the future". However, people like currencies that are backed by something, because at least they wont collapse for no reason. Being unbacked means the price could collapse in the absence of a dollar meteorite crashing to the Earth. 
If the value of the dollar fell a lot tonight, how would government force, specifically, bring the price up? Why wouldn't the price of everything merely go up by a factor of a million? Why has government force repeatedly failed to stop such hyperinflation?

They say that the practice allows them to go after drug gangs more effectively by holding their assets hostage. Presumably, drug offenders would then turn in people above them in response for their stuff back. This is at least reasonable, if extremely thuggish. They shouldn't use this in cases where there are no drug gangs, though. Somehow I doubt a bill to do this would pass.
Then they say that it helps them buy stuff they couldn't otherwise afford. Like, what do they think abusing civil asset forfeiture means? By any reasonable definition, stealing innocent peoples' money and spending it on yourself is abuse of civil asset forfeiture. They literally confess to abuse when they say that.

It would take 1-5 days for the block time to return to normal, depending on how the difficulty algorithm works. The network would be fine.

If you bought a bitcoin at the top, you risked 1 bitcoin worth of value. That risk has not paid off, yet. You still have 1 bitcoin worth of value, even though that one bitcoin is worth less. If you bought a million bitcoin for a penny each, you risked a million bitcoin worth of value, and you have a million bitcoin now.
The Federal Reserve gives out trillions of dollars that dont represent anything at all. Nobody took a risk, made a trillion dollars, and gave it to people, it was conjured. With bitcoin, no institution can conjure it out of nowhere at will. That was the point of my post.

So, when people say that commodity currencies are backed by something, while paper currencies are backed by nothing, they talk about gold's usefulness in jewelry, et al. Why? 
Well, let's say that you woke up tomorrow and the price of gold was a millionth what it was the day before. What would happen to the price going forward? Well, the price would get bid up by jewelers, et al. To a more reasonable price. It wouldn't go up to it's original price or anything like that, but it would go up to something. This means that there is a floor on the value of gold. 
Does the IRS or military provide a similar floor for the value of a dollar? No. If the value of a dollar fell by a factor of a million tomorrow, when the IRS asked for billions of dollars, youd pay for it by working at your job, which pays millions of dollars per hour. Theres no reason to expect the value to go up by a factor of a thousand, and every reason to think that the dollar is now worth literally nothing but sentimental value to non-numismatists.
Now, it's possible that the value of the dollar could be bounded below by the price to create the bills. They have really good fraud detection built into them, so that even if nobody knew that they were dollars, they would probably still be used as currency. Counterfeiting dollars bills is basically impossible, and that is a great property for a currency to have. But this isnt what people mean when they say that the government is what backs the currency.
By this argument, bitcoin isnt backed by anything, either. If the price of a bitcoin was a penny tomorrow, youd have no reason to expect it to hit a dollar again.

Governments have occasionally abused their money printing power? That seems like an understatement. Every government with the power to print money today has completely monetized their debt. That's like the textbook definition of abusing their power. The central banks job, ostensibly, is to maintain price stability and economic growth, not print money so that the government can spend without caring about anything.
Also, people do use 100 dollar bills for legitimate purposes. I've never had a store refuse a hundred dollar bill. Like, the point he was making was stupid and tangential, as bitcoin is in fact used for noncriminal purposes like all the time, but at least his example should be based in reality.

Socialism isnt a synonym for collective action, it's a large group of political ideologies. According to some socialists, bitcoin is evil because money should be abolished.

I think the problem is that the average of \(.01, 1, 10, 1000, 200, 400, 800, 20000\) is not at as sensitive to order of magnitude changes in the early numbers as it is to small changes to the number 20,000. So, the numbers are basically a measure of the price in 2017, rather than being truly an average.
one could adjust the numbers by, say, dividing the price per day by the geometric mean of the price over the year, with the center of the year being the day being analyzed, meaning that an order of magnitude change on any day will be noticed, and the beginning of the year won't be unfairly penalized just because the price has been growing for the majority of the time being analyzed.

which is basically identical. One thing to note is that the last data point included in the average was november 1st, so the high december numbers don't even take into account that there was just a price explosion. And, the results in October are not being artificially held down by the price explosion we just saw, because the price ratio was at its highest this October compared to other octobers.

Fiat is used in every day transactions and business deals. This means that at all the stages of production, a price in dollars was negotiated, meaning that future prices have to be stable. The store owner has to know that the good costs 1 dollar from their seller, and that people are willing to pay 5 dollars for it. For this to work, there has to be a concept of what a dollar is worth. This is done by analyzing the past, and inferring future prices from them. It is this price discovery that leads to price stability. As long as prices dont change that much, the process works, and prices all move in concert.
People who accept cryptocurrency are pricing it in dollars, and then converting it to bitcoin. The dollar amounts are what matters to them, and the bitcoin is mostly liquidated immediately. This means that the concept of how much a bitcoin is worth is irrelevant. Price discovery only occurs when the currency is used in all parts of the business to calculate profit and loss. So, because no price discovery is occurring, the actual price is instead determined on a pseudo stock market, and a small one at that. A million dollars will not move the Dow Jones industrial average, but can move the price of bitcoin mountains. So, given that the Dow Jones is unstable, the bitcoin price is even more unstable.
If he current price of bitcoin reflects anything, it reflects the speculated future price multiplied by the probability of achieving that price. The future price is speculated to be in the millions, and the probability changes in people's heads by orders of magnitude, which is easy because the probability as expressed by the market is around a percentage point. If somebody corrects me about the probability of success or future value, then we are part of the reason the price is so unstable.

Youd be up, but hodling would probably be better. Let's say that the price of bitcoin doubled every year, exhibiting extremely precise exponential growth. This analysis would say that it didn't matter what day you bought. However, if you bought and held, you'd make tons of money.
What this says is that there tends to be short term downturns in October, that tend to lead to dramatic increases throughout November and December.
Edit: If you look at the graph, it suggests that you should buy in October, sell in December, then buy back in in February. At least for 2017, this obviously would have been better than hodling.

It just isnt true that deflationary currencies suppress investment. Bitcoin has what can be called hyperdeflation right now, yet people are investing in cheap hot alts left and right, to the point that the value of these investments are greater than the value of bitcoin itself. When the price stabilizes, and has ~1 percent a year deflation, there will be even more investment.

You're goddamn right. Bitcoin is about fighting the central banks. 
But in order to beat the best, you have to be orders of magnitude better than them. If lower throughput and high transaction costs make bitcoin worse than the dollar,  et al. then there is no reason to buy bitcoin. 
I dont buy bitcoin because of low transaction fees, and high transaction/second numbers, but both need to happen in order for people to not get pissed at bitcoin when it starts taking over.
@_date: 2018-06-22 01:57:22
Most have 1 sat/byte as a lower limit, but 1 sat/transaction is the true lower limit. If a sat is worth around a penny, you'll see transaction fees that low. You might even see probabalistic fees, a 50% chance to have a 1 sat fee. By that time, however, I like to think that the satoshi will have been redefined to be a smaller fraction of a bitcoin, so a minimum transaction fee would be a thousandth of today's satoshis, or whatever gets chosen.

If you commit fraud against Starbucks, they dont take action against Visa, they take action against you. Same thing here. 
Bitcoin isnt trustless because you cant trust the process of adding transactions from the mempool to the blockchain, you do have to trust that this was coded properly. You have to trust the code at every step of the way, unless you actually read the source code of everything you run. It is trustless because it doesnt require me to trust you in order for us to do business. If a business trusts you, then being trustless isnt necessary. As long as the rate of fraud is low, zero confirmation transactions can be trusted. Business can have lists of people who defrauded them, and either not accept their business, or require them to get 6 confirmations in order to do business. Companies already do this today. 
I expect that companies that sell really expensive things will require confirmation. If you defraud Starbucks out of 5 bucks, Starbucks will be pissed, but they wont face financial ruin. If you screw Lambourghini out of their money, they've just lost like a hundred thousand dollars. No company can just eat that. However, the paperwork on purchasing lambos take more than an hour, so requiring 6 confirmations isnt that big of a deal.

The price of bitcoin is part of the equation that determines the cost of producing a bitcoin. The higher the price, the more people will mine it, increasing the production cost.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:54:37
Part of the answer is that technology will advance, solving this problem, part of it is that this isnt really a problem in the first place.
Visa transactions take around a week to confirm, yet you dont wait in Starbucks for a week for your bank to transfer funds. Part of the reason for this is that Starbucks trusts Visa and your bank to actually withdraw money from your account and put it in their account. If they trust that to happen, and are satisfied giving you products a week before they get paid, then they'll trust unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, and give you your products 30 minutes before they get paid.
Is this bad practice? Sure, but it's what is going to happen.

If the blocks are large enough, the transaction fee is defined to be 1 satoshi per byte. Right now, the system isnt overwhelmed, so both prices are the same in satoshi. However, since bitcoin cash is worth less, the price in dollars is higher with bitcoin.

The data you are hashing includes the hash of the last block in the chain. So, in order to nuke the chain, you have to find a block that returns the same hash as you put in, plus a bunch of other data (a header representing 0 transactions plus the nonce), and also has that hash value less than the mean difficulty of the bitcoin network.
The probability of this working is 1 in 2^256, given that you have successfully mined a bitcoin block, which is already hard enough.

If you spend more on a bitcoin than the current market value, you're an idiot, and the people selling are scammers. However, if buying mining contracts wasnt a scam, and were actually cheaper than buying bitcoin at market value, those mining contracts would be just fine.

Basically, they are saying that the bitcoin network cant adjust to difficulty drops effectively. Let's say that the mining rate is x. But then, the hash rate goes to x/10. It would take 5 months for the network to resume churning out blocks at the same rate. Ideally, you want to notice that the block rate has dropped significantly, and start adjusting as soon as possible. 
At least I think that's what the post is saying. In general, you should ask people to explain things, not debunk them. Maybe the point someone is making is a good one.

Let's say you buy like 100 asics for 1k a piece. From these, you get a continuous stream of income. However, if bitcoin's price collapses, making your rig unprofitable, you just spent 100 thousand dollars to lose money. So, to mitigate this risk, you sell part of your rig's power just above to make sure that you will make money on at least part of your asic farm.
The collapse is likely why predatory contracts exist. They acted like the price of bitcoin was going to be around 15k throughout 2018, and needed to recoup their costs somehow. How better than to swindle the suckers who think that bitcoin is going to be 1 million dollars, so selling them at an effective price double the current actual price doesnt really matter.
So yeah, dont buy a contract unless you are getting more crypto than you would get from taking your money to an exchange. I've literally never seen a contract like this, so dont purchase a mining contract. 
I'm just saying that there is a theoretical basis for mining contracts to be good for both seller and buyer, even if there are only contracts good for the seller right now.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:09:35
I can see why somebody would sell part of a profitable mining operation. It reduces risk, and even if they lose money on the paying out more than they produce, that might be worth it.

@_date: 2019-06-17 00:24:12
Well, sure, it is spreading the risk around. However, my hypothetical contracts would be akin to selling a bitcoin for 5k right now. That's not predatory, its basically giving away free money.

Could you split the blockchain in two? Have two almost independent bitcoin blockchains that only communicate when somebody wants to send bitcoin from one group to another? Both ledgers would have to trust eachother, because if somebody sends a bitcoin to mars, the Martian ledger couldn't independently verify that the source wallet had any bitcoin. They could verify that the bitcoin being transferred came from earth, though, although this wouldn't scale well as space was colonized.
Martian people would probably be dealing mostly with other martians, and those who need to travel from one planet to another could send their bitcoin ahead of them.

There is no such thing as an algorithm that can resist a quantum computer. Quantum computers can do anything classical computers can, and you can run a very basic quantum search algorithm that would reduce the time to find a block from being linear in difficulty to square root in difficulty. Getting a ~500 qubit quantum computer to work at good frequencies is a very difficult problem (and a 20 million qubit one for cryptonight would be much harder) , but quantum computers could take over bitcoin much more thoroughly than asics have.

Let's say that I love meat, but my sister is a vegetarian. Our parents make us sandwiches, mine has tons of meat, hers none. However, we get our sandwiches swapped accidentally. I have a sandwich I hate, my sister has a sandwich her ethics wont allow her to eat, so we both will be hungry. Clearly, the economic value of our sandwiches is extremely low. However, then we switch sandwiches, making us both better off, clearly the economic value of our sandwiches is extremely high, because we have avoided starvation. But what changed about the sandwiches? Absolutely nothing, the only thing that changed was the ownership, yet economic value has been created. If sandwiches had intrinsic value, it would be impossible to increase their value through an exchange, the same way it is impossible to change their mass, caloric content, or nutritional value through exchange.
If food doesnt have intrinsic economic value, and we need it to live, what does have intrinsic economic value? Hunks of metal? How would that work?

Economic growth is naturally deflationary, and the impact of printing money is not even throughout the economy. In order to meet their 2% price inflation target in an economy with ~3% economic growth, the money supply increases by somewhere between 0% and 10% per year, with 5% being a typical value.
Apples to apples, bitcoin already has less monetary inflation than dollars.

The idea is that the economy is a whole bunch of money moving around, being traded. If there is a penalty attached to holding your money, people will spend more, making the economy grow. If there is a reward attached to holding, people will horde money, and the money won't move around.
The economic framework by definition assumes that consumption is good for the economy and saving is bad for the economy. Look up the "paradox of thrift" for more information
Personally, I think that the keynesian economic framework is deeply flawed, but i am not an economist, i just read austrian economics in my spare time.
edit: Inflationary currencies also encourage investments, which hopefully grow faster than inflation and grow the economy just as much as consumption. If someone includes investment as part of saving, then my statement that saving is bad for the economy is not true. I assumed that saving was simply holding your cash under your bed, as bitcoin hodlers basically do, which is only part of savings in the "Investment = Savings" argument.
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:38:06
I had a typo, I meant 50 percent reduction, which isn't technically true, because the new transaction does need information to say what it is. It's pretty darn close to 50 percent, though.
The overhead is on a per transaction basis. Every transaction needs proof that the sender agreed to send the bitcoin. If you had enough transactions to fill up a gigabyte sized block, the overhead would be a huge portion of it.
Increasing the block size would technically solve any "not enough block space" problem, but using it as a catch all solution for every problem is lazy.  Batching is a better solution because it actually reduces the transaction size with no downside. Batching is an old feature, too, it's just been brought up recently because it turns out exchanges didn't hatch their transactions, needlessly inflating the value of block space.
Bitcoin cash, which I assume you support from your comment, has batching functionality, and people would have to be stupid not to use it. Bitcoin cash transaction fees arent under any stress whatsoever from a lack of block space, so it does matter less.

Seriously, everybody learns the definition of life in biology class.
 In order to be considered alive it would have to respond to stimuli, which I guess blockchains do because their contents are determined by the transaction queue. It also would need to be made of cells, which I guess you could consider each block to be a cell if you wanted to be overly broad. But it would have to be able to grow, which it does at a rate of a block every 10 or so minutes. But it would have to have a means of regulating its growth to maintain homeostasis, which is what difficulty scaling is meant to do. But, it would have to have a metabolism, use energy to grow, which it does yet again because mining requires electricity. But, it would have to adapt to its environment, like if it developed a lightning network in response to high fees. Wait, I got it. It would need to be able to reproduce to form new organisms.

The amount of short positions exploded as the price went from 8k to 6.5k, and a good fraction of them were liquidated in the sharp increase. I was looking at a Twitter account that updates when large margin positions get liquidated, and over 50 million dollars worth of short positions were liquidated in a single minute.
I didn't like the transition from 8k to 8.8k either, but after a dip that had every excuse to be apocalyptic, the price has repeatedly been bid up to 8.8k. Of course, support levels hold until they dont, but this level has been tested a whole bunch in the last week, and passed every time

A bitcoin transaction has a whole bunch of information in them. The sender,  reciever, and amount. But it also contains a whole bunch of stuff that basically proves that this is a transaction the sender agreed to. The latter is actually larger than the former. So, if someone is sending bitcoin to a lot of people, they can say "I consent to the following 100 transactions taking place", attach 100 sender receiver amount triplets, and use a small fraction of the amount of space 100 transactions would take. 
I've seen two transaction on my coinbase withdrawals, and that alone causes around 80% space savings.
Transaction fees are determined by the amount of bytes that the transaction takes, so the transaction cost goes down. Also, because the amount of blockchain space can support more transactions, the demand for bytes goes down, causing prices to go down even more.

perhaps, but not for this reason. nothing has intrinsic value, since value is subjective. the reason that gold is worth whatever it is worth is because people are willing to trade an ounce of gold for however many dollar bills. similarly, the reason bitcoin is worth whatever is that people are willing to trade a bitcoin for however many dollars.
bitcoins are used as a medium of exchange. the price could be volatile so that people might not want to use it, but that isn't a bubble. prices fluctuate all the time,  right now it is because people are buying bitcoins to make money, rather than to trade with. bitcoin doesn't have the market share to whether the storms right now,like the dollar can, so you will see market swings like this until the investors get out and the traders reign supreme once more.
