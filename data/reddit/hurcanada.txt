I absolutely agree that the cost of technology is a central problem and I mentioned as much in the article. Yes, hardware will go down, but the number of non-cash payments is also increasing every year in quadratic fashion, so hardware usage will also be rising quadratically, and there's really no knowing what the limit is there since we can't account for cash payments. The growth of the human population is also something that needs to be considered.
In the end, those are numbers are (very) rough estimations of global scale and we can expect them to be even higher. If you're betting on Bitcoin to grow as fast as possible, then you're betting on technology prices falling even faster, which I'm not sure is a good bet to make.

That really depends on your assessment of the risk you face, assuming you're talking investing in about a hardware wallet. If you're not trading, at the very least I recommend moving to either a paper or mobile SegWit wallet.

If you're not using SegWit, fees are more expensive for you right away, and less transactions overall are being fit into blocks. I wrote in detail about how SegWit works [here]( but basically, SegWit transactions have a lower "weight" attached to them compared to legacy transactions, and so more SegWit transactions can be fit into blocks (up to four times as many). So if SegWit is used collectively, there's a lot more throughput for transactions, and fees will ultimately be lower because of that as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:05:15
There are no fees if all transactions fit in blocks. There's no incentive to attach fees. The only reason fees exist is because of a throughput problem.

If mining nodes raise block rewards illegally, full nodes reject the miner. They don't propagate the malicious miner's results. As long full nodes outweigh malicious mining nodes, the chain is unaffected. Simple. 
The game theory you've outlined may or may not hold true, but you are **putting complete trust in miners**. There is no more trustless system at work here. You are trusting miners to play nice with each other. If there was a nash equilibrium, it would not be instant. What do you think is going to happen to the network in that time? And there are going to be rogue players at any given moment.
You're also ignoring the issue of insane cost and the huge barrier to entry to mining at this level of scale. There is very little competition left to work with here when the cost to run a single node is in the tens of thousands range.

This is an interesting point. BIP173 is one of the very latest BIPs to come out, and it's great that Electrum is on top of it, but I agree that it's probably not a good idea using it until it's adoption is more widespread. 
In the meantime, there are several other wallets that use P2SH for SegWit addresses that I've listed. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:28:02
Nope, it does increase the block size. Transactions are just weighted less, so more can be fit in a block. I wrote about it in detail in the tweeted article [here](

You're still using Bitcoin. No third party, no trust involved. Also if the network becomes extensive enough you're still looking at instantaneous global transfers. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:32:11
I'm not sure what the process is when buying off LocalBitcoins. The way you save fees is by ensuring the exchange you're getting your coins from uses SegWit, so any transfer fees to your own wallet are minimized. Then, also make sure you're transferring your coins to a SegWit wallet, so that when you want to send them out again, you're minimizing fees once more.

"Hash 256 proof of work stake cryptography area", not so sure about that. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:00:54
Yes you can. SegWit wallets function just like normal wallets. All the money saving magic happens on the nodes/miners side. 
Edit: I'm a little wrong here; if your SegWit wallet address starts with a "3" then yes, everything works normally, but if it starts with "bc1" (bech32 format) it's not entirely compatible yet with other servicss. See the comment below for an explanation 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:36
I wrote an in-depth article about it [here]( There's essentially a bottleneck on the number of transactions the network can propagate and the lightning network would move transactions off of the network and open secure channels between users.

I am a relative beginner to the Bitcoin scene myself and I was faced with the same dilemma as you when I was starting out. 
My recommendation to you would be to go out and research all the facts about what both BTC and BCH aim to do in terms of scalability yourself. Look at the impact of large block sizes, the whitepapers of things like Rootstock and Lightning Network, what the roadmap for both coins look like, and what the developer community looks like.
I spent several days doing the above before I ended up writing the article in this post to essentially lay down the roadmap of BTC for beginners and others who are having trouble finding all the information they need to know, since there's so much to know out there. But you shouldn't listen to me or anybody else if you really want learn the facts of both sides without bias. Go and find them yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:03:05
It seems AirBitz is rebranding to "Edge", and "Edge" supports SegWit, so there is a little bit of confusion there, fixed that. 
Also, the ["bc1" is a definitive bech32 segwit prefix]( Its used in wallets such as Electrum. Addresses that start with "3" have been around since multi-sig support, they are [P2SH addresses]( Although many SegWit addresses are P2SH addresses, its not a definitive indicator of SegWit, which is why I didn't include it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:55:19
Yes, that's exactly whats happening! There are some caveats such as the fact that the Bitcoin Core client doesn't have full GUI SegWit support yet so people can point fingers at it when asked why they don't have SegWit yet, but [dozens of exchanges, wallets, and services]( have implemented SegWit already. 
My guess is that a lack of education about the benefits of SegWit leads to people not asking for it/being skeptical of it, so services and wallets see no need to spend time and resources implementing it. I wrote this in an effort to bring awareness to the issue and to hopefully get more people using SegWit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:05:43
I'm a huge fan of how user-friendly Trezor and Ledger Nano S are. They're definitively ahead of the pack when it comes to wallet support. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:32:06
Absolutely, I agree SegWit adoption should be sped up and mentioned as much in the article. I'm doing some more research on SegWit to clear up all the misconceptions about it

[If we lived in a Bitcoin future, how big would the blockchain have to be?](
I wanted to visualize how big the blockchain would be if we kept increasing the block size to meet Bitcoin usage demand, and so I wrote a little piece about it. It's a good insight into why scaling just the blockchain isn't very sustainable.

How is trusting 1-2 monopolized miner pools that are spending hundreds of millions to uphold the network to act honestly any different than, say, the VISA and MasterCard having centralized server racks to handle their combined 300 billion+ transactions a year? They too have economic incentive to not run off with your money, but the decentralized ship has sailed. 
Transactions will also keep increasing in volume (not *proportionally* if off-chain takes off, but it will still go up), and as long as there are fees, there will be miners. Big players will move away if it's not profitable, difficulty will adjust down, and there will still be profits to be had. You seem to be stuck on maximizing miner profits at all costs. Bitcoin's purpose was never to ensure miners profit exorbitantly. As long as there is enough economic incentive for miners to secure the network, there will always be some around.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:00:06
Its important to consider that the Bitcoin developer community is attempting to develop long-term solutions to scale Bitcoin and reduce fees, a lot of which are getting ready to launch in 2018 (Rootstock is launching on Monday, Lightning Network perhaps as soon as next month). 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:28:32
You appear to be correct! I misinterpreted Schnorr's implications with respect to obfuscation. Fixed that in the article

This is a valid point that I didn't think to consider. However, the impact of the cost of running a mining node at the scale I've outlined is still incredibly detrimental to promoting decentralization. 
First, by the time Bitcoin reaches the scale I've outlined, Bitcoin rewards will probably be negligible, so the incentive for mining probably won't be as large as you think. The cost of supporting larger and larger block sizes will also continue to grow and considering [the relatively competitive distribution of pool mining is at the moment]( the majority of these players may inevitably be priced out. 
I personally feel like the detrimental impact of non-mining full nodes is overblown - I understand they serve no purpose when it comes to mining, but at the end of the day they are the ones that set consensus rules, and ensure they are enforced. More nodes also promote the propagation of the network. [Have a look at the current distribution of nodes]( if we don't let users have the ability to scale the network, we start returning towards centralization by relying on entities.
I recommend reading [Nick Szabo's Money, Blockchain, and Scalability]( which helped me understand the importance of Bitcoin's network distribution. Here's an excerpt that stood out to me:

Yes! [They've had SegWit support for a while now]( Check out the article for a full list.

Based on the principle of trustlessness, its not safe because its closed source and you are trusting the developers to not steal your money (which defeats the purpose of owning your Bitcoins). They also don't use SegWit and don't allow custom fees, so transaction fees will be higher and you're not helping network health. 
However, nobody has lost their money (yet), so its up to you decide whether or not its worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:03:44
Let's assume you get rid of all non-mining full nodes. There will be an incredibly high cost to entry when it comes to running even a single mining node at large scale - a start-up cost of well over $20,000 and a monthly cost of well over $5,000, not accounting for electricity consumption. Block rewards are all but gone (94% of blocks will have been mined by 2024).
Who do you think will be competing for hashing power? Current pool miners are absolutely out of the question. You are looking at near-billion dollar corporations, of which there are very few. You are putting the power to propagate and validate the Bitcoin network into the hands of centralized server racks.
Miners also have an economic incentive to break consensus rules. For example, if they were the only nodes that existed, why not collude to raise block rewards? There aren't any non-mining full nodes stopping them! 
A non-mining node is one that has the choice of accepting a block as valid or not, and then propagating it to other nodes. If this decentralized check and guard is not in place, miners can essentially choose to do whatever they want. As long as full nodes exist that stop them from breaking consensus, they have an economic incentive to be honest. If there are no full nodes, that economic incentive disappears.

You will have to send a transaction to a Segwit address. Your best bet on minimizing this fee is to watch the mempool until it dies down a little bit, then send your transaction.

If your intent is to day trade, then keeping coins on your exchange is probably what you're looking for. However, giving up control of your coins to a centralized entity is the price you pay and the risk you bare. There's no way around this unless you use a decentralized exchange or transfer coins to your exchange from your wallet only when you plan on selling, and otherwise transferring them to your wallet to keep them safe. 
If you are planning on holding and transacting with your coins instead, I recommend transferring them in a SegWit enabled wallet instead, due to the benefits I mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:11:01
SegWit was much more than just a block size increase. It fixes issues such as transaction malleability and quadratic hashing and is a fundamental protocol change. See [here]( The ability to fit more transactions in a block and lower fees due to lower virtual size is only an added bonus. SegWit adoption is needed for future innovations in Bitcoin.
