I think that is a good description of the situation. One other thought is that the protocol itself, as amazing as it is, isn't likely to be the final, best version. We're getting so much experience with Bitcoin that no doubt there will be innovation. It'll be interesting to see if those innovations can be incorporated into Bitcoin, so that the coins survive, or will require a rebirth in some other form. As an example, the original internet protocols have evolved and had many layers added, but the original pieces are still more or less intact underlying everything else.

I think part of the confusion is trying to compare Bitcoin to traditional currencies. LK has some valid points if you look at it that way. However, Bitcoin also has some utility for low transaction cost transfer of money, etc., a bit like a bank card, and it trades like a commodity. So for me I think we need to separate out whether it is a classic currency from whether it will be successful and continue to have utility.

Depends what you actually offer. For online, Coinbase seems to do that for nothing, but if you have retail gear, that'd be different.

FWIW, solvency and runs on the "bank" shouldn't be a problem for an exchange that holds all client funds in escrow. Essentially the exchange makes money on transaction fees, so as long as money is flowing in and out fast enough that those fees exceed expenses, it is good to go.
In the case of Mt. Gox it seems like one or more of the following went wrong:
* A bunch of coins were seized by government agencies
* Maybe customer funds were getting used as part of running the business or for other purposes
* The big one would be if the reported huge theft was real -- effectively hollowing out all or most of the coins held on behalf of the customers.

It is one of the types of Bankruptcy in Japan, apparently similar to the US Chapter 11 (where the business keeps operating during the process).

I expect any buyer would attempt to only purchase the assets, not the liabilities. The buyer might still make good on some of the losses as a business decision, or if the sellers insisted on it as part of the deal, but I'd be very surprised if anyone would be willing to wade in and take over the potentially huge liabilities Mt.Gox may have.

Right now, it is different because the Bitcoin collective isn't really a thing. It is not an organization with power over territory and people (especially including the power to tax). Doesn't mean it couldn't be. Also doesn't mean it won't work as a community, but it is definitely different from a formal government that rules over a population and territory (enforced by a military, for that matter).

As a small business, one major difference is the $30 or so it costs me to do a domestic wire transfer. Overseas is even harder and more expensive, at least with the bank we use. So we only use it for large transfers that need to go overseas or that need to get somewhere faster (and safer?) than mail.
