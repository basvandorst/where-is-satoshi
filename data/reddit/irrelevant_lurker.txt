If you believe taxation is theft then you must unavoidably be okay with anyone murdering you with no consequences whatsoever. Since, you know, you don't want to pay for a legal system or law enforcement anyway.

Taxes aren't theft unless you use none of your rights as a citizen of the US, nor lives on US soil. If you're not paying taxes, then as soon as you're using anything provided by the government, laws for example, you are the one stealing from the government. 
Even if you don't entirely agree with how the tax budget is spent, it doesn't justify you avoiding taxes altogether.

Volatility will drop if they increase the market cap and add more options to bet against bitcoin, i.e. shorting. Futures might help as well. In the distant future, bitcoin could still be a currency. But personally I believe that if a cryptocurrency became a circulating medium, it wouldn't necessarily be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:26:26
You shouldn't pay tax for the money you put into bitcoin. You should pay tax for the profit you make from bitcoin. That is completely fair and understandable.

"HODL" could arguably cause greater deflation because as soon as the prize stabilizes/drops, people are going to want to buy as much btc as they can in order to make a greater profit (since most people predict bitcoin is going to rise).

No one exactly teaches "rich is evil". People just realize that rich people are getting rich because of exploitation. Workers aren't getting paid according to what's fair, they're getting paid according to the free market of labour (i.e. getting paid as little as possible for the corporations regardless of the employees needs). This criticism isn't new and lazy. It's been around centuries at least. Many western countries have countered these issues by progressive taxing and taxing in general, strong social welfare, free healthcare, labour &amp; wage laws etc. Those are the same countries that consistently rank highest on world happiness report, HDI, gini-index, democracy-index and more.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:22:31
The problem is you're too vague. There's a difference between an employer making two times my salary versus 100 times my salary. That difference is what indeed rightfully makes them "evil".

If you believe bitcoin will ever become the standard currency for a significant amount of people it must increase, then there's is no doubt. The market cap is way too low for it not to increase in value.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:30:53
So why are many people getting paid much less than they need to be debt-free? They have no other option, and that's not fair.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:54:34
It doesn't have to become a currency but there is no other clear reason why bitcoin should increase in value unless it becomes the main currency for a large market, or maybe by manipulation. Either way I think we're past the point where we saw a huge surge of bitcoin owners due to the trendy technology and FOMO.

Not individually but the collectively the people of the US is responsible for millions of death around the world. Luckily for the leaders, US citizens are relatively happy and have high living standards so they don't really care about what's happening abroad as long as they see have a stable foreseeable future.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:52:19
I do concede being born within the US border doesn't make you responsible. Voting for anyone not willing to change the US military actions makes you responsible, be it by ignorance or simply lack of caring.

The laws don't do anything about it because it has never been an issue before. Just like we don't have laws for how we should be handling an alien drunk driver. That certainly doesn't mean it's legal though. In fact, it is up to a court to decide the lawfulness of it all. Bitcoin is a way to store value/money and you can easily put money in or retrieve it at any time. So regardless of whether bitcoin itself is recognized as money, it is obviously a liquid asset.

There was basically some old forum thread where a guy was telling everyone that "I AM HODLING". He unintentionally made that spelling mistake and somehow it became a meme to "hodl" bitcoin, since bitcoin always seemed to increase in value.

Well then you are simply unclear in the way you express yourself, consequently I am not committing a false dichotomy. It's just a misunderstanding then. And as I said, the challenge I stated was more of a rhethorical operation than a serious (naive) suggestion.

Because decades of regulation along with the introduction of several bitcoin derivatives could lead to bitcoin becoming a more stable, low-volatile currency. Now THAT would be terrifying for financial institutions because if bitcoin would win the trust of the public, today's absurdely overpowered financial institutions wouldn't be needed. At least not in the sense they're needed today.

Corrupt/broken whatever, doesn't change my point at all. My "challenge" is quite obviously a rhetorical way of saying that patent laws are incredibly difficult to perfect, I didn't genuinly expect you to follow through with such a task. And I'd argue it's more naive to think that getting rid of patent laws is what we want/would solve most issues. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:57:13
You said my argument that no patent laws would be worse was naive, thereby implying you think it would be better to have no laws at all rather than the current patent laws. So maybe you're the one with the problem of reading what you have written yourself.

Regulation doesn't necessarily mean the government has any authority over bitcoin itself. It can help bitcoin become an established currency in a nation with well-defined laws that help counter criminal actions involving bitcoin. 
I get the sense that you don't understand what derivatives are. I am obviously talking about the financial term "derivatives", which indeed brings stability to assets. That's one reason why stocks are in general much less volatile than bitcoin. 


That's just a temporary trend you've picked up, likely because "bitcoin millionaires" have blown up a lot in media. There are still quite a lot of people who want banks' obviously absurd amount of power gone. When more and more people who have used credit cards and modern banks all their life die, more and more people might actually start trusting bitcoin over banks. But I can't predict the future of course.

Which is why patent law is complex, detailed and subject to continuous change. It's easy to say "the system is corrupt!!" while it would in fact be as corrupt without any patent laws at all. It is definitely a grey area. I challenge you to write a perfectly fair and corrupt-free set of patent laws. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:54:39
The underlying tech is completely irrelevant to the value of bitcoin, it's merely a condition for bitcoin to exist. The "underlying tech" exists in all cryptocurrencies. What does matter, though, is the bitcoin hash rate. If miners and hash rate starts to steadily decrease, then people would lose their trust in bitcoin as a currency and probably find less value in it as an asset.
