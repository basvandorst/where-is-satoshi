I bought a 1080 Ti for $739 on Amazon 2 weeks ago.

It's about $80 per month to leave it on mining 24/7.

You mean like your most recent "don't upvote" thread?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:35:48
Do you have any proof to back that up?  I'm not saying you are wrong, but everything I've read comes to the conclusion that there will be no noticeable difference in processor life, even if you run it at 100% load, as long as the temps are within the recommended operating temperatures.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:48:10
Along with a Ryzen 7 1700x which is around $2/day.  The past 48 hours have really seen profits decline, but last week NiceHash was estimating a monthly payout around $600-$650.  Now it's around $450-$550.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:23:39
I have a 1440p 144Hz monitor so even a 1080 Ti isn't enough to maintain that at the highest settings

I didn't haters talking about the PC, just for the lack of a good chair. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:04:59
I do both.  I bought a gaming rig before I got into crypto, and just added a second 1080 Ti mainly to mine, but also for gaming.  My estimated payout is $500-$650/mo, so I'm looking at it as paying off my gaming PC by mining.

You can stop spamming this on every post now, thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:27:51
So you'd pay money to mine?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:09:13
What would wear out?  My understanding is that if the temps are kept within the recommended margin, it wouldn't shorten it's life.  I mean if you go grab an old computer from the 1990's I bet it would still work just fine, minus the mechanical parts like the hard drive and fans.

@_date: 2018-01-16 20:24:40
Are you saying you could be getting $900-$1200/mo with two 1080 Ti's and a Ryzen 7?  I'm mining using Nist5 currently.

NiceHash Legacy, and it uses both

@_date: 2018-01-03 21:19:53
So true, even today it's like selling it for $15k and feeling like you're a genius for waiting this long, when who knows in 2 years it may be $150k.  Or it could completely crash and be worth $0.01.
I think of it sort of like gambling, if you keep playing eventually you end up with $0.  You gotta cash out at some point.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:54:41
About $80/mo, and as long as the temps are under control it won't really shorten it's life, since there's no mechanical components. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:45:45
Very true. Think about it, everyone saying to sell now at $15k and walk away with $25M might be pennies compared to holding for 2 more years if it hits $50k. Then again it could drop to $1k. 
It's always easy to look back and say "if only I held until this date". There's a lot of investments that looked promising at the time but ended up flopping. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:33:42
It's more about the principal of it.  Why buy from stores who will continue to breed new dogs, when there are many in shelters waiting to be adopted?  Since this dog was purchased, another new dog was bred to take it's place in the store.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:50:53
The idea would be for fewer and fewer people to slowly stop buying from pet stores, causing them to realize it's not as financially rewarding as before and then cease operations eventually.  Not to all of a sudden stop 100% of pet store sales causing the animals they have to be euthanized because no one bought them.
If you buy a pet from a pet store, they replace that now empty cage with another one that was bred for pet stores.  If you don't buy it in the first place, that's once less that was bred.  Versus an animal shelter which doesn't breed them, but it's one less that has to be euthanized due to overcrowding.

 is so true, and something I found out over the past few days.  I kept trying to buy low and then sell high when it went a bit above what I paid, but I tended to buy at the wrong time and it dipped soon after.  Now I'm left having to rebuy in at much higher cost than when I started.
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:38:34


You don't need that when getting cash tips.  You can take your $50 in tips, pocket it, and use it to buy gas, food, rent, etc.  Completely untraceable too.  Besides, most people already have a bank account.  The argument here is that you're making the server go through hopes for $5 or whatever you left them.
@_date: 2019-03-17 23:45:47
Usually in the U.S. ATM's are free if you go to your own bank, or if you have a credit union that reimburses your fees.  But if you're a member of a large national bank and use any other companies ATM, it costs money.
In France, what's the incentive for shops to install their own ATMs if they don't get any fees from it?

Lmao sure man, you can keep drinking the crypto kool-aid. I have a lot in crypto but I'm not blindly believing it's going to the moon because of memes. You're a fool if you think the sp500 won't recover after the next crash. 
Speaking of crash, 2008 was nothing compared to the crash of crypto from 2017/2018.
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:18:17
Probably due to how spread out the US is, you often find them in places far away from any banks. We have lots of towns and rural areas that dont have any banks nearby, and that's when you find these private ATMs

Who pays for those ATM's then?  Why would a shop owner pay for an ATM, it's electricity and networking costs, security, etc. if they don't get anything in return?
@_date: 2019-03-17 23:50:30
You're not accessing your money, you're making a transaction to take someone else's money (the shop keeper), and there's a fee for that.  Would you rather not have the option when going to a fair or farmers market or something where it's cash only?

Yeah in hindsight it sucks, but if you held at $20k because people here kept saying it's going to $100k, only to see where the past 2 years have been, you would have wished you sold instead.

Right, but saying "you are your own bank" isn't really true, since banks operate their own networks.  Technically my wallet is it's own bank since it stores cash.

@_date: 2019-11-05 00:14:43
If Bitcoin jumps to $20k next month, would you even be able to cash it out in RH?  Or are you limited to a certain dollar amount per day/week/month?  That could really suck if you start cashing out only to realize it will take you weeks to do, in the mean time Bitcoin is crashing hard like early 2018.
You really should have just bought it on Coinbase or something.

Yeah, making someone go through that for a one time tip is exactly "bullshit". Plus they have to pay transaction fees to move it and/or convert it.

It's gambling, here gambling winnings are considered taxable income. You can't count what you've spent on gambling as an expense write off though.
@_date: 2019-03-18 00:54:03
You can normally avoid fees by going to your own bank or using a bank that reimburses fees, but it's the ATMs at stores or that are privately owned that normally have fees to incentivize people to install them.  Really useful for places that are cash only, so you can buy stuff if you don't have any.
@_date: 2019-11-26 18:02:47

People thought we were going to $100k in late 2017 too
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:25:32
Nope.  I save up money each month in a 2.15% savings account, while cost dollar averaging into crypto.  When there's a major downturn in the market, I buy in more using the money that was accruing 2.15% for a couple months.  If you took out a $20k loan to buy crypto today, and the market turns to shit dropping 50% and stays below what you bought in at when your loan is up, what are you going to do?  How will you pay that back without selling your crypto at a loss?
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:47:34
You don't store wealth in fiat... But if you're looking to store short term from say employment to buying goods, fiat is great. It would suck to get paid in BTC and when you go to pay rent 2 weeks later find it's dropped 15%. You need a store of value that's reliable
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:16:28
Why never stocks? Diversified stocks are very reliable investments if you hold for decades, i.e. retirement
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:11:47


Yeah, okay.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:22:27
Even if you have lots of money to your name, taking out credit card debt to buy crypto is horrible advice.  The perk is what, a few percent interest which equates to a couple hundred bucks a year?  Even if nothing horrible happens like you lose your job or have major health issues (or someone close to you does that you help with financially), it's very likely this person will see crypto or another investment skyrocketing, and say "hmm what if I take this $20k in my savings account and invest that in X, then at the end of the 12 month 0% APR I'll have even more money!"  Only to have that investment fall right before the 0% ends, and now you're stuck eating your loss or paying a high APR waiting for it to recover.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:12:28
Or they're just in reality.
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:16:54
You can predict the future? Investing everything in crypto is very risky
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:15:13
If you said this in early 2018 you'd have $500 now. It's a gamble whether it will be higher or lower in a year
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:12:44
Not enough to offset the fees associated with paying with a card over ACH.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:51:55
That's blind optimism.
@_date: 2019-10-20 02:40:30
And I'm sure others convinced people to buy Bitcoin in 2017 when it was near $20k, saying it will keep going up.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:10:27
I'll turn that around on you.  Look at Google, started out small then kept growing, just like Yahoo, but instead it kept growing and growing and is bigger now than ever, meanwhile the "alts" like AltaVista, AskJeeves, [Search.com]( and dozens other are all gone for all intents and purposes.  Just because something is big now, doesn't mean it won't keep getting bigger while others go away completely.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:48:46
Choosing Bitcoin is great, blindly following it and agreeing with shitty memes is something else
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:06:11
Just because you want to bury your head in the sand and want everything to stay the same, that's not reality.  At the bare minimum, put it in a high yield savings account.  You can find them at or above 2% with 0 risk.  Put them in a CD earning even more, again, 0 risk.  There are lots of ways to minimize the devaluation of $1 with little to no risk.
@_date: 2019-10-14 00:51:39
This is dumb
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:51:14
Paper money is more anonymous than crypto...
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:08:52
Of course.  Where did I say I use this savings account as my investment?  I'm using it as a place to store my money that I'll be using in the short term, for bills, fun, and for investing with.
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:51:40
No I didn't, but I'm pointing out that you easily could have recommended they buy Bitcoin right before a crash
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:11:09
The problem is people who don't have cash on hand and live paycheck to paycheck are exactly the type of person who would run into problems with buying lots of crypto on credit.  Everyone should have an emergency fund.  If someone spent every dollar they had on crypto, that would be an idiotic move as well.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:18:12
This is horrible advice.  Technically, you're correct if you're doing this all on paper.  But being $10k in credit card debt means that if something happens to say your job or health you can get into a very difficult situation if you need to use the $10k in your bank account for bills, while now having to pay interest on your CC debt since you don't have the funds to pay it off anymore.  But what about that 1 BTC you originally bought for $10k?  Well unfortunately the market dipped and now it's only worth $6k.  Do you take that out to pay off what you can?  Or keep paying 25% APR on your credit card until it recovers?
If you want "free money", you're better off signing up for those checking accounts to get $300 or $500 bonuses than to take on credit card debt.

I'm all for the goal of BTC, but needing to have your friends pay your fiat bills or use services that charge a fee to convert it to fiat and pay the companies doesn't seem like a desirable move. Good luck getting Comcast, your gas and power company, your mortgage company or apartment complex, doctors office, pharmacy, grocery store, etc. to accept crypto. Sadly they all deal with fiat and not crypto, so you're left converting it yourself first or paying a service to do it.
I'll stick with my credit card where I get paid 1.5-5% for buying things, rather than paying a fee to pay my bills.
I agree converting them back and forth isnt good, but as we've established companies aren't paying you in crypto, so you are already converting the fiat to crypto for a fee before it reaches you.

The idea is you put money into Coinbase, then wait for the right time to buy.  Not try to deposit funds the instant you want to buy, unless you don't mind paying extra fees.

You're an idiot.

You suck at selling weed. Just stop.

And the opposite happened to me.  I made a deposit via bank transfer, and the value had dropped in the 5 days it took to arrive.

Why do you hate it?  Most banks I go to don't accept coins if they aren't rolled, so using Coin Star to turn it into Amazon for no fee is a win-win for me.

You have to pay for your bank account? There are so many free checking, savings, and credit cards out there. My savings account has $0 fee and pays 2.25% interest...

Just because they heard of Bitcoin, doesn't mean it's a good thing.  Lots of negative things happened that people under 30 would have never known to not exist in 2040.

It's still higher than it was 60 days ago

Yeah that's why I only do it for gift cards that I'll go to anyways, they don't charge a fee for those.

I'm sure they'll talk to you again in 6 months laughing at you

Got a 1080 Ti on Amazon a couple weeks ago for $739. You just gotta actually put some effort into finding one. They're available.

$10k is the limit for 2 of my banks, and the other is like $2k.  I had to deposit a $20k check when moving funds from my retirement and I had to drive 1.5 hours to a Chase ATM since there's none in my state.  I don't have any stats and totally just guessing, but I bet the number of customers online only banks have compared to the large national or regional chains is tiny in comparison.  I bet quite a few people in their 40's and older have accounts with banks with branches vs online only.  Whenever I go into a bank there's always a few people in there, so if you figure you go to the bank maybe once or twice a month for a total for 5 or 10 minutes, and there's always people in there, the cost of helping you that 15 minutes is paid for by the money you keep in your accounts.
You could also say that the customer is actually paying for that service, since most large banks with branches have close to 0% interest on their accounts vs the \~2% you'll get with online accounts.

Damn I should check them out, that's huge

I wish I didn't need cash, sadly it's still very much required in the US for several things.  I just wish you could deposit large checks via the apps, that's the only reason I have a bank with physical branches.
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:00:24
Deposit large value checks, deposit coins, count large number of bills/coins, receive bills in denominations other than 20s, get cashiers checks, answer questions that are much easier to explain in person, etc.  I mean you could say the same thing about any retail store, why have a store when you can order it online?  Plenty of people prefer to deal with other people rather than do everything online.

Jesus how many different payment methods do people use there

Well I rarely go to a bank, but when I do it's usually uneventful.  The tellers are usually nice, and I'm in and out in a few minutes.  What are you going to a bank for though that you can't accomplish online or at an ATM?
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:16:45


Once you do that, the value will climb to $8k then $9k then $10k and you'll feel like you're missing out on a run and buy in at $10k.  Selling and buying at such small differences in value isn't really worthwhile unless you have a TON to sell to make it worth the risk.  I made this mistake back in 2017, where I bought, sold at a profit waiting for it to dip so I could buy more, but the dips never made it low enough and then it just kept going up and up.
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:21:34
That's risky though.  If you followed this logic in 2017 you would have sold for like $4k when it started to climb, and missed out on the $20k because it never really dropped much.  Look back to earlier this year when it was around $3400, if you bought at $3400 then sold at $3600 after a little pump thinking it would drop again, it never did, so now you'd either be out for good or end up buying back at more than you sold for vs just holding.

I'll stick with the safety and perks of credit cards over cash when possible

But you're just converting your Bitcoin to USD correct?  It's not like you do your taxes and it says you owe X amount of BTC that you need to pay by April.  The amount of BTC you owe probably depends on the value of BTC to USD.

You bought bitcoin with credit cards?  Why pay those extra fees when you can just do ACH/wire?
