I sort of understand where he's coming from, but his comparisons and analogies were not very well thought out or not applicable. He's right that the 100 thousand bitcoin copies are intrinsically worthless, but there are so many innovations and real world usage in other coins that he didn't even bother to research before making a blanket statement. 
Yes it'll have it's dot-com moment where the shit will fall off, but there will definitely be the Google's and the Amazon's that will come out of the technology

The key is never sell, because from my experience when you do, it always goes up afterwards

From what I've heard, the address for Satoshi is heavily monitored as those funds are assumed dead and not on the market. So if a transaction occurred, then there would be a sudden crash with the "inflation"

I semi fucked up, and I'll full on admit it. 
I thought BTC was gonna tank after the split (I did not reasonably expect a currency to actually go up in price after a hard fork split) so I traded all my BTC to alts. That was not too too bad cause right now ETH has actually gone up more than BTC, without the added benefit of dumping BCC of course... however I had a some Canadian dollaridoos waiting for low BTC and instead missed out on a 20% gain.
Such is life, I've corrected now. All hail BTC.

If Craig Wright wanted to prove he was Satoshi, he would post something on Twitter saying he'll move Satoshi's coins the next day at noon, and then actually do it.
I know that would absolutely tank the value of Crypto, but otherwise there's no way to really prove it

IIRC, the value of Bitcoin is what it is because it's assumed that Satoshi's coins have been lost and are not recoverable. If the community sees that nearly 1 million of a possible 21 million coins are potentially active, then it would be like if the US suddenly printed roughly $525,000,000,000 dollars overnight

Unless your pretty technologically adept and get permission (assuming you still live at home), mining may not be the best option. 
For trading/holding, best bet is to find an exchange, register to be able to make a bank draft (may take a week or so based on volume), submit a bank draft to the exchange (usually a week or two depending on bank location and volume), and in those 2-4 weeks learn as much as you can about potential coins you'd like to invest into, and judge whether or not they're worth the risk.
Before August 1st is likely the best time to get into the game if you're ok with some risk and uncertainties. Once bitcoin figures their shit out, should start to see some gradual gains again, and less volatility. And as always, with any decently risky investments, only put in what you're willing to lose in a worst case scenario. Good luck man!

How much time do we have to move assets?

Is it long term gains one year since I converted fiat to crypto? Or is it long term gains one year after my last trade?

I won't outright say any as usually that gets the "shilling" response. I'd check out the top 20-25 on  as a good percentage of those coins are legit and have active developers. Through that site you can click on a coin and get to their website to learn more about it. Most of the top coins have subreddits as well, which can usually be found on the sidebar of r/cryptocurrency, but there are a couple others that you'll have to manually seach up and subscribe to if you're interested in that coin. Making a multireddit with different crypto subreddits in it can be easier to access new threads without cycling through 10 different subreddits. 
Self research is annoying and takes time, but there's less chance of being taken advantage of by unscrupulous fellas and makes you feel more personally invested if you believe in what a project is trying to achieve instead of just making a quick buck.

I dunno, it's recent rise makes me think that people are pumping it up trying to grab "free" BCC. there's gonna be a correction of some sorts
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:05:30


Most important line in the article IMO. People are thinking they're getting free money with buying more Bitcoin. Maybe a select few will make money off this, but for those looking to dump BCC for a quick buck, my bet is on BTC to lose it's value as well.

Even better, just send it to someone who only has good things happen to them, then nothing bad potentially happens!

Shoulda done that a couple days ago buds
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:45:20
I think it's inevitable as long as there's a chance of a coin split. People would rather lose out on 5+% than hold and potentially have much larger losses with a divide and general uncertainty. Especially since other coins are going strong with great upside right now that are easy to transition to.

As someone who lives near Vancouver, this. Too much dirty money from China is being liquidated here.  The idea that buying a townhouse is going to cost 400-600k sickens me. I know too many people who commute over an hour to work because they want to own NOW so they arnt priced out forever, but can't afford anywhere close.
