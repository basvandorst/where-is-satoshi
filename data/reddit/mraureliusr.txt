Pretty sure printed currency is way more anonymous, at least for now. Unless you want to pay a huge mark-up for a BTC ATM, or other service that accepts cash.

Okay, but how is my real money not good online? I use it everyday. Transactions are instant, not delayed by a few hours. I have consumer protection and insurance if something goes wrong. These are all glaring omissions from Bitcoin that I discovered after my first post. It's so unbelievably inconvenient that I'm surprised anyone uses it at all.

That's a bit... incorrect to say. Bitcoin is just as scam-able, if not more so. At least the current banking system has insurance and consumer protection. Not to mention, places actually accept real money. Almost all the vendors that "accept" Bitcoin simply use a service that converts it into real money for them.
After doing a bit more reading, I've decided that Bitcoin is most certainly NOT the way to go. I do believe that the system can work, but Bitcoin is hopelessly inadequate in so many ways. I really do hope that a better, more widely backed, insured, and well-built cryptocurrency comes out in the next couple of years.

What would my car have anything to do with anything? And who drives a Fiat these days?

Sadly, it's been "pending" for way too long.

It's bullshit and has basically completely turned me off BTC. It's too bad, it's such a cool idea and I'd love to use it at some point.
