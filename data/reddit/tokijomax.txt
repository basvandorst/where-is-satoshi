Each community in their own currency on INTERNET must be in an uproar around following price.
At least in Japan is so fussing that from 80:20 law as you know 8（八） is very  meaningful and good number in Japan. 
1BTC = 800,000JPY in Japan
1BTC = 10,000ZWD in Zimbabwean
1BTC = 9,000AUD in Australia
1BTC = 6,000EUR in EU
1BTC = 5,000GBP in UK
depends on time and rate

Chinese government try to reign the bitcoin used by Chinese people. Chinese people try to use the bitcoin decentralizing the power of Chinese government. This is not about the cryptcurrency. This is about power struggle through the medium of cryptcurrency.

Oh my China! History repeats itself. Last time in real world as The Great Wall. This time in virtual world as Great Firewall.
Bitcoin will be put to the real test.

No Government can deny the ownership of crypto now. The trustee of MtGox looks like a thief. The old ripoff legal systems are crumbling. Disgusting!

China is the first nation to use paper money called Jiaozi in history. China will stick strongly to paper money and that is one of the reasons to stand against bitcoin. Show must go on without china until Chinese make new china.

People in a country decides whether to adopt Bitcoin. If the majority begins to use, all that country can do is to ban like China or to follow the technology people can't resist to use.
