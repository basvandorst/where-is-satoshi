Does this operate directly from the data coming from the blockchain or do you have to intercept it and manipulate it somehow?
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:11:51
Thanks for sharing!  For the time being Im thrilled to contribute the most I can.  I guess I will find out if I have a GB cap with Brighthouse!

Is that a Desktop widget?&gt;
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:51:29
Coins are stored on a laptop in my safe + usb drive.  But I have used the core wallet before!

Paid? I like it
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:31:20
I hit report to ebay, i urge you to do the same.
@_date: 2017-02-04 01:09:12
This is super cool. I love seeing new visualizations of the blockchain.  I wish i knew even the slightest about how to make stuff like this!

Sketchy - I feel like they froze it because they want to let the price rebound before they start selling coins again. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 02:46:12
Agreed! I want it to go to $100k but in order for it to be widly accepted we need stability in a sense.  Merchants are a great example - I dont want to accept payment for something if it can drop 20% tomorrow.   Either way, im a buy and hold so too the moon (but slow)

90 thats is pretty serious! I am now just getting my big desktop synced up interested to see what a more powerful machine can process in a weeks time.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:56:43
Yeah alot of trust is involved here
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:02:24
Trying them out now!
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:23:51
I posted to let people know its a scam\ and let google show a result next time someones tries to research that site.  Not a shit post but rather supporting the community to save the next guy.  You are cancer.
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:41:13
How do you double spend?
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:13:39
I assume it doesn't matter much - but then again I dont know much about email servers.  I wasnt sure if being on the same local network gave you an advantage.   I read somewhere that exchanges will operate their own nodes  which led me to believe it must do something for their transaction times. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:08:35
This is the most helpful thing ive ever seen posted in reddit!
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:57:52
Well its $50 and ill offer $25 to anyone that can salvage the transaction.  you interested in helping? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:44:05
Local Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:31:31
yeah those users were promoting that site 5 days after it was registered. I refuse to believe they just "heard" of a site 5 days after it was registered. These guys are in on it and they are active contributes to BTC subreddits. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:39:59
Getting robbed is hilarious 
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:38:30
Thanks so much for taking the time to answer. I will read into that post!  
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:41:26
So i send money to the same address with a super high fee but that didnt do it. I assume when you say spend it again you mean somehow replicate the transaction. No clue how to do that.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:28:10
Agreed.  
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:14:00
I understand research is the smart thing to do - but I struggle with how its funny to you that people lost money.  As if it was deserved?  
Your name looks familiar, Im pretty sure you are the same guy that shit on everyone posts in r/DIY_Ejuice and r/ElectronicCigarettes all day long ever day just to be a dick. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:37:56
Downvoted already, man reddit is cut throat.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:42:21
Thanks so much for your feedback.  Running Core on 2 laptops - so thats 16 connections at least!  Once i have my beast back up and running ill get her online as well. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:43:02
I would love to hear your input.  I hear that alot of mining takes place in China.  Lets say that china government goes insane and outlaws bitcoin and shuts down all big mines. Is the network able to keep running with the mining pools and individuals around the world without too much slowdown? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:02:36
Where is this?
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:32:29
Cute, i forgot reddit was primary a platform for people to be shitty to eachother.
@_date: 2015-11-08 03:53:40
Ya I have been trying to verify my account with coinbase for a while now.  I will keep bugging them to approve me. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 04:06:22
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:14:48
Can someone create a dummies guide?  I am a long term bitcoin supporter and have been running a full node most this year.  I want to show support but I am very cautious.
