Why do you never convert to fiat?  What if you only get paid in bitcoin and have to pay rent?

But why greece?  That argument would apply to any country.
Greece is specifically a country that is in a mess because of its inability to devalue its currency.  That argument would be much better applied to a country like El Salvador that has been successfully running a country without being able to control its currency (they use the US dollar).

If you can get &gt;60% of the hashrate to collude you can do much more malicious things than this.

Author "bio" from Forbes:
"I am a Christian, a patriot and a defender of liberty who tries to keep a sense of humor through the madness. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio and work in the banking industry. I'm blessed with a beautiful wife who homeschools our three children. It has become evident Washington now embodies the gravest threat to freedom. We must restore the vision of the founders before it is too late. This prompted me to begin writing. In addition to Forbes, my work has appeared on American Thinker, RealClearReligion and elsewhere. I'm also a contributing writer for The Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation. My book, The Courage to do Nothing, will likely be the most politically incorrect take you'll ever read on economics. Please contact at billflax2

So Income Tax is officially sanctioned by God?  Not theft after all...

$90K invested should return you 5 to 7 grand a year, well above your cable bill.

His comments do not make any sense.  You can't value a currency by dividing the total amount it is used in a year by the number of units of currency.  (I'm not even going to get in to velocity of money here)
Just to demonstrate how ludicrous his line of reasoning is:
 * The united states GDP is 17 trillion dollars each year. 
 * There are 1.2 trillion dollars in circulation.
 * Therefore every dollar is worth $14.16!!

"Surprise! Despite endless American complaints about over-taxation, the U.S. has one of the world’s lowest marginal income tax rates, at 27%."

no, my comments do not assume anything about remittances or whether salaries are paid in bitcoin or fiat.

If all he was saying was "If bitcoin is used for more and more purposes, it will generally go up in value," then he'd be right.
But that's not what he is saying.  He is making specific conclusions based on nonsensical arguments.
If this is Roger Ver's level of understanding of how currencies work, I think the bitcoin community should treat his views with skepticism.
