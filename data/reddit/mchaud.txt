Did you tip the trolls ? :D

If Bitcoin gets to 10K$ I will stop eating Cheeseburgers.
I might even try caviar.

Give us the name of the bank so those who care don't give them business.
@_date: 2015-01-23 20:51:07
OMG you're right, the hashrate is soaring !!! 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:46:57
Yes, on an exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:21:31
Keep it running
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:49:07
Great, thanks ;)
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:23:20
I second the CSS framework solution.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:34:29
Yeah me too I used to love fries before I learned these are made of asparagus. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:23:28
I would use USD price in bold and bits in regular/small.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:52:12
I'm not really into this but I must admit that you showed some skills.
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:58:24
$1 and two satoshi ;)
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:37:46
This is so convincing...
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:32:35
There was a bot named Willy. Just kidding ;)
More seriously, I don't remember if they support Cryptsy but you may wanna have a look at this : 
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:02:04
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:28:38
That's a nice move !
I should look into this ChangeTip thing too
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:32:52
I mean all the major markets (like on the websites I mentioned) obviously.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:39:19
To me it looks like a fake placeholder domain... like the ones on parked domains.
In two words : not legit
Just my 2 cents, some ppl might like it though
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:52:05
Or wait, buy at 10 and average the cost.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:24:13
It's looking good so far on 1M
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:30:44
They taste good but they're not champagne.

Hey, my krytotag is "fab". The idea is good, but like coerciblegerm said, you should revamp your website a bit :)
Even using an already made template should help adoption.

@_date: 2015-01-14 21:24:58
You are talented.
Where did you learn to master paint.exe ?
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:19:55
Yeah but miners will step back in when the difficulty drops enough again.
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:07:10
Very bad as it would really imply he tried to/did influence the price.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:46:55
There's his full name on btcjam...
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:59:09
Do you really think VCs invest only into companies providing return (or immediate return) ?
Bitcoin losses will be covered by other succesful investments.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:08:46
Thanks but AFAIK winkdex is not realtime/updated like the ones I mentioned.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:50:38
They never said that
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:11:28
Yup saw that thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:21:15
Make it simpler as in : 
Don't copy it though that's just to show an idea.
Don't give up ;)
I must say that I like the idea, and could probably be one of your customers.
If you use some kind of escrow service on top you will definitely attract even more people.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:11:04
This one is nice too, thanks.
But like I said above, in case someone knows one with combined/superimposed lines that would be even greater.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:03:24
Unfortunately he won't be able to buy the puppies, as btc will be worth nothing by then. 0$ x 1 trillion still equals 0
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:25:38
Not everyone uses dollars...
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:09:36
Very clever thing ! Thanks.
I was looking for combined graphs in one window like winkdex but updated in realtime.
However this one great too.

Your reddit history is a proof itself
@_date: 2015-08-27 19:13:46
Circle once worked with international credit cards, but since a few months they don't support them anymore (at least all the ones I tried, 5 different Visa and MC).

@_date: 2015-08-27 19:42:23
Like they will pay from their wallet...
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:10:44
It works with some non US/USD cards.
