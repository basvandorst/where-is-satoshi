Why because I want BTC as the Wall St coin and if it is going to be that then Circle / Coinbase is heading the right directions. I even agree with 80% of the NY laws that are being proposed because they are trying to tie an address to a person just like a checking account.  
Yes there will be ways to get around this such as Dark Wallet and Monero but I don't do anything shady and thus have nothing to hide, and don't care if they see what I have.  (Yes I own Monero also)

Why would they?  Cash is still easier to use and only reason to accept Bitcoin as a small business is because Bitpay/Coinbase has 1% fees versus a credit cards 2.75 fees. The are not keeping the Bitcoin.
The small business still has to make money.

You need to know when you make a purchase its in USD (or fiat of your country) with XBT as the medium of exchange only.  In case of a refund it comes back in XBT at that exchange rate.  Could work out for you in more XBT or less, that is the risk you take.
I would assume that they pay you 0.0028 1 Lier? and you will get 9 more Lier at the current exchange rate once they figure out the mistake.

This is exactly what happened with the computer - Private Keys is not a bank account - its the actual value Bitcoins are just the transfering credit.

Any time you buy goods and services the transactions will be in USD basis, therefore you got what you where owed.  Like it or not.

Let's use this an example.
You are a Air Conditioning Vendor.  I bought a heat pump for 1 BTC at current value price of $1,000.  But you come out here and find out that this one does not work, so you return that $1,000 (price of BTC soars to $2,000 a coin) at 0.5 BTC.  
Well thats understandable, but I am then going to ask you about that $1,200 unit that does work, and at that time it costs me either 0.6 BTC (0.5 BTC already been returned back) or another $200 out of pocket to get the unit I want.  
The risks of this will remain until BTC stabilizes at a price of $100,000 - $1,000,000 USD a coin.  But as a customer base, Bitcoiners understand this.
Start accepting with the Transactions being in USD and BTC as payment options in and payment refunds back at current Bitstamp Rates.

My experience with Bitcoin - (Linked)
So currently Down $34.59 USD, with basically no BTCs in my Wallet and some money in MT Gox – I think the current people jumping aboard to use Bitcoins as a true currency will need to take about a 0.5 to 1 BTC hit learning the system.  For me a $72.50 dollar investment to play and get accustomed may only become a $34.59 dollar loss that with increased interest and growth in BTC will be recouped.
The investors just dumping money in and out of MT Gox will be accustomed to day trading but with Dwolla now down how easy will it be for them, we will soon find out.

People lose money investing in their 401ks daily depending on when their companies and themselves put it in the funds from their paychecks.  Hell I put in mine via work on May 28th and since then the S&amp;P went from 1660 to 1610.  I "lost" that money, long term growth is what is being hoped for.

Bitcoin has succeeded as an internet currency, to be utilizied in true main stream (buy groceries at Walmart on your phone), then the systems to do so must get easier for every day people with ALOT more security.

If not enough people is selling to keep up with new market demand (Venture Capitialists and Investors stock market types) then they wont have enough profits and take their money elsewhere, gold, silver, stocks.  Therefore the markets will return to the $25-$40 price where BTC users (not the guys buying large scale in Mt Gox) sets supply demand.
Yes supply/demand curves work here but if the demand is not getting met by supply in something so new could cause a collapse to where the supply/demand would go back to every day users.
Thus taking out the big dump issue.

People have to run businesses (ie get USD) to pay bills - electric, salaries, and such.  In order to do it you have to sell bitcoins and why not try to make a large sale so you can buy bitcoins back cheap.
Also investors is treating Bitcoins like Gold therefore it follows that market line, Until mass adoption this will happen.  What do you think would happen if Satoshi sold his 100k - 1million bitcoins at once?
The cap limits on Mt Gox right now is a good number but allows these Venture Capitalists and outside investors to make money.  When they make money we make money.

The payout thru blockchain of 1,300 btc happened, then the user (or someone using his computer as he says) bet the 'fake' 1,300 btc that was accidently left in his balance on the site.  The 'fake' 1,300 was bet and lost via the site and redisturbuted to the investors.  So when the rollback happened only the redisturbed was deducted.  No other bitcoins went thru blockchain.

Loss what you can afford to, right now this is still gambling even if you are holding and not actually playing poker online.
The miners updating their systems and paying for electricity could lose it all tomorrow but can they afford it, probably.
I am up money and bought in after the bubble popped at $250 (watched it go up from $80 to get there) because I did not have time to research what was happening quickly enough.

Rich people did run it up, the people who watched Fox Business in April bought in at Mt Gox, so did the people who watch CNBC.
The VCs who watched those channels figured they could make new companies and more money.
Yes the rich ran it up, you dont go logarithmic unless a major development.  If the rich would have not ran it up it would be sitting at $25-$40 a BTC right now.  
It would have increased by not 10x.

It has Lowes for $100 and at Lowes and other places that sell gift cards like Giant Eagle that also gives fuel perks for buying other gift cards therefore you can get a Lowes card for $100 and go there and get a Visa prepaid card and pay everything.
I can definitely Get on this with all the options.

Not at $2.5 mil, they can get out their $50k (all Mt Gox allows in a month) and watch BTC price drop and buy back in.
This is not a noob or emergency this is a very smart investor or early adopter who has learned how to manipulate the system.  Again 1^ percenters can do this.

Because the billion or so people that uses it would complain its very slow and shares of its public trading company would drop like a rock.

All that happened is somebody wanted to cash out his $50k per month (for either profit or cash for business expenses) from Mt Gox, so he decided to sell his 20k BTC at $125 for 2.5 mil.  He then proceeded to cash out his $50k and drove the price down to $116 per BTC which he is slowly buying back on way up to $125.
Which means he will now go from 20k BTC to 21k BTC while getting out his $50k for expenses and spending money.
This is going to become a norm, at the 1st, 15th , and 30th of the month as businesses and people utilize bitcoins as cash/investments.  It wont be as bad when BTC are more wide spread between people but right now 1^ percenters control the price.

No its a serious question, 15-25 year olds have really not "invested", imo.  The have not contributed to a 401k so they have not rode out the highs/lows like in 2008 when I saw my boss who I gave advice to diversify since he was getting old lose 50% of his retirement which kept him from retiring in 2009 and just getting to retire this year.
15-25 year olds are not seasoned, imo.   That is why I made the suggestion.

Thats great I will have to book mark that.
Again I voted for Ron Paul when he ran for President become I think at the time economically he is what we as a nation needed.  The other things he suggested probably not so much.

With the continued lack of service ability of Mt. Gox, it really goes to show you more issues recent adopters have in getting and moving coins/USD.
The best way to continue to grow bitcoin is slow and steady and actually using it as a currency, so hoarders out there that want the price per BTC to increase, you need to be moving ~20% as you grow and keep that 80% share hid.  Otherwise no new money in the system will just decrase cost/BTC.

I find it interesting that because the USD trade value is $113 means its finally worth something.   (Something to individuals are very different)
I have sports memorabilia that I fell is very valuable but others would not pay me what I would want to let go of it.  This is alot of what Bitcoins are now as many have not just invested money into buying them but time that is a greater investment.
