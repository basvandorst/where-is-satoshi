Biggest thing I've seen between the different crypto reddits is that Dogecoin hates the least. Actually, I've never seen a doge post that is outright hating on another coin. I've seen posts laughing about being hated on by other coins, but that's it. I've even seen posts making the point NOT to hate on other coins.
I got into crypto less than a week ago, and while I've followed the activities of bitcoin for about a year, I wasn't in a position to get in on it. I got a random tip on twitter with Dogecoin and decided to check out (and learned about) alternate coins. Since joining up and now (barely) mining Doge, I've downloaded a Bitcoin wallet. Now that I have the wallet, I'm looking at faucets just to give myself a base of something to work with in that coin. Then I may be looking at Litecoin afterwards.
This is how it works. Provide a place for people to get in, and they may expand into others that look good to them. Shibes don't hate these other coins as much as they've been hated. We respect Bitcoin's position. We aren't trying to replace anyone. No one talks about that. We just want to help people, to find a need and fill it. Bitcoin was the middle vehicle for us sponsoring the Jamaican "dogesled" team since they have the exchange(Thanks guise!)
A lot of us see ourselves as the third runner in terms of economics, coin value, and whatnot, but we also see ourselves as the best of what cryptocurrency is. That belief will take us to the moon, and everyone (even other crypto) is invited.

Because pride comes before the fall? I hope there's something that can scoop up BTC out of this turmoil.. but it seems its issues are more in the coin's peripherals (bad PR) than the tech itself
