Are you suggesting that deaths of those in another country don't matter as much as your own?
The difference is that the US rarely annexes countries which are in its sphere of influence, so while the deaths in Ukraine are attributed to the USSR, people like you can brush off the countless people the US killed in places like Bolivia since it isn't a state. But you can rest assured, the deaths in Bolivia and Chile are as much on the hands of american politicians as those in any other part of the American Empire.
If countries had to annex those they took over rather than just install a puppet then the US would be a lot bigger, and it would be a little easier to see how bloody its history truly is.

At least its still better than capitalism, which does all of that with none of the benefits.

Well we have the US which has caused the deaths of people all around the world, by overthrowing democratic governments which act against US interests while starting countless wars.
There's also Britain which artificially created the Irish potato famine, even blockading the island to prevent other countries from giving aid in fear that it would lessen Ireland's dependence on Britain.
In fact the crimes of capitalist countries are almost always worse than those of the "socialist" ones, as anti-socialists tend to exaggerate or misrepresent such crimes. I suppose you think it was Mao's fault that it basically didn't rain in China for three straight years?
