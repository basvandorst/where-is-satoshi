Last year my wife and I bought a new set of lawn furniture from Overstock.com. It was a good price and I was pleased with how easy it has become to purchase things on line. I have yet to purchase any bitcoins for myself, but once I do I think the first time I coco someone's bobo will be for a Club O membership on that site.
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:29:33
Here, let me coco your bobo.

Oh, I haven't dabbled in such things in many decades... just a nightly glass of wine with the wife for me, now.

Wow, how does this work? You can coco people's boboes on this page? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:41:55
Ah, it sent me a message that says the tip failed. I deposited about fifty dollars in the account but it's telling me that most of that is "not yet spendable". I'll be sure to recoco your bobo as soon as it is made available. Sorry about that.

Not at all, just be sure to pay it forward and coco someone else's bobo. This is the way of the bobo coco.

Bobo cocoing is not a sexual act. To demonstrate, allow me to coco your bobo right now.

Thank you! I have already purchased a bitcoin through Coinbase, I just need to figure out how to use the tipping feature on this site. I will look over the link you sent me.

@_date: 2014-02-14 20:02:08
Can somebody explain to me more the concept of double spending? As I understand it, someone could send me bitcoins without actually cocoing my bobo, and I could get cheated this way. How can I protect myself against this?
