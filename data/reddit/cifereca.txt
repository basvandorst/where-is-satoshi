There already is contention. Some users avoid privacy coins or have lower amounts invested due to fear that government would ban them and reduce their value. Those with a lot of value at stake in bitcoin will run through the same though, so miners would prefer the status quo over making any material changes

Bitcoin privacy features will never come out. Most bitcoin users don’t even want privacy. It’s more contentious than block size, and will never be implemented as well as monero

If it’s so private and second layer what’s securing the network? If I trade with someone what stops them from lying about what happened?

And in six years when those are implemented it still won’t be as good as monero is today. Taproot is an improvement to privacy by protecting against casual explorers but it doesn’t protect against blockchain analysis much at all. By this time anyone who cares about privacy at all will be using monero and there will be no incentive for the remaining economic users to accept any further privacy changes in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:42:58

Yes,  crypto has near zero correlation with all other major asset classes: stocks bonds real estate gold. It doesn’t matter much if this correlation floats up to .1 that’s still a huge diversifier. Ultimately it’s still a ten year asset class so people will be cautious and invest much less than optimal until it becomes clear that the ROI will be the highest for decades. I predict low correlation with annual returns of nearly 20% on average until maturity in the $3-10 trillion range. This places crypto at 1-3% of global wealth. In a bubble it may find itself upward of 15%, which is the optimal weight assuming inflation matched percent expected return. If we agree with efficient market hypothesis it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that crypto will have the optimal weight globally, and that should not be any less than 1%, as supported in many studies. Right now markets are not efficient due to many market frictions that hopefully will remove themselves over the next five years. That’s why we’re seeing many institutions building infrastructures that eliminate frictions because the institutions that do that will collect all the fees from the migration of assets to the optimal portfolio. In this scenario users who can navigate through the frictions will benefit from outperformance over full market cycles, and confident investors could find themselves overweighting crypto relative to optimal until the market finds its equilibrium near $3t. If the logic makes sense, and you are a long term investor, you may be comfortable with 30% of your networth in crypto. This is especially relevant to the younger generation that has long time horizons, high human capital, low average net worth, and skills to navigate frictions that impede adoption.

The role of crypto in portfolio management is the killer app. The actual value from creating better sharpe ratios shouldn’t be underestimated. Buying coffee or digital avatars is not what is bringing the most value, it’s protecting people’s wealth during tail events, reducing overall portfolio risk, and if ROI is to stay relatively high for the next few decades, creating lots of wealth. Some People think this ends with bagholders but actually it ends with people keeping 15% in crypto and rebalancing as needed. Those who get rich will never sell it all and will probably have the largest overweight holdings in crypto relative to average

I came in way too late in 2013. Same story different year. Be an investor not a day trader. Investors set target allocations and rebalance frequently. Any investor who bought at ATH is buying today. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:10:14
Accumulators are far more important than holders. The healthiest participant is one who accumulated and dumps in bull markets. These are users who have a target allocation and range for crypto, say 5-20% and rebalance to 10% when the bounds are hit. These participants reduce volatility and support prices, and for their own benefit naturally dump peaks and buy dips.

If bitcoin recovers to ATH within 6.5 years he’ll get 30%. Longest bear market ever? That would actually be past two halvings. It will be interesting to see if bitcoin hasn’t recovered by then. Bitcoin block reward will be 1/4 what it is today.

There’s only a limited amount of wealth in the world and it only grows so fast. Bitcoin can’t be all the wealth. $7t would be 2% of the worlds wealth, and is a tremendously large number. Now an average pc has say 8gb of ram, which is 125k larger than 64kb. If you take $333k and divide by $125k you’d get about $2 per bitcoin to be comparable to bills claim. so my statement is nothing like bills.

I don’t think so because you can’t prove it, but with crypto you can. For example prove to me that trading stocks is free speech. I don’t know how to prove that because there ownership isn’t based on speech. The decentralization and cryptography of key ownership is identical to a public forum. I can post transfer instructions on Facebook and not actually do the transfer myself. I can print T-shirt’s to transfer. I don’t think this is possible with other things. My argument is based on the idea that none of us actual own any crypto, it’s all publicly shared with keys

Buying bitcoins in 2020 for $5000 is a bad idea even if you think it will be more. I was just making a point, where if the market would double he price because of a halving it would already be $6400. It’s priced in. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 02:21:45
Except the price doesn’t rise and so miners quit, so difficulty adjusts to half so even though they’re earning 1/2 bitcoin it’s twice as easy to mine so he price stays the same and they’re just as profitable. What you’re missing is people won’t pay twice as much for s bitcoin just because miners get paid fewer bitcoins. Are you willing make an agreement with me to buy bitcoins from me for $5000 in 2020? You must expect this to be profitable deal and I’m willing to make it with you

Sample size of two is not big enough to draw conclusions. Also if you really want to buy a bitcoin for $5000 in 2020 you’d escrow $5000 and I’d get a $3500 loan for 2 years at 8% interest, buy a bitcoin immediately, and then sell it to you for $5000 in 2020 and repay my loan which even at 8% interest would be much less than $5000 and i would profit no matter what. Even if I thought bitcoin would be $1m in 2020 I’d still do this because it’s guaranteed profit. Though I won’t actually do it because it’s a pain in the ass for $1000
