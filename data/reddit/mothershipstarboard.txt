There is a ridiculously low limit to the positive effect until more of these hosted nodes are redundant. Lets say a few per data center would be useful. That is not a solution.

That's just silly. By your logic why not have ALL the nodes in data centers. Surely this doesn't make the network vulnerable by enemies who could target and attack these data centers to disrupt or cripple it.

I'm curious to know legitimate reasons why this etf would NEVER be approved? Emphasis on the "never" as opposed to just much later than expected.

That does nothing to increase decentralization. You could have a million nodes, but if they are all vps housed in a huge central location as vps's are, it is worthless. There is no increase in decentralization achieved.

Thanks Eric for being a voice of reason. However,
after all that has happened for trust to truly be restored, those with commit access who are employees of Blockstream need to make some kind of statement regarding the conflict of interest, especially in regards to Blockstreams revenue model (which is completely opaque) and/or give up their commit access/leave Blockstream to rectify the conflict of interest. This of course does not mean they can't continue to work on both. It just means they are not allowed to steer the "SS Bitcoin" AND have a responsibility to the investors of Blockstream which from all observations seems at odds with Bitcoins proper success.

This is BS character assassination.

So if there's some critical technical bug, political disaster (kinda like now with the blocksize) or otherwise overbearing issue with the dev's, miners, etc, then all of crypto suffers? Ya that's smart. 
There are a multitude of benefits to being completely disconnected from Bitcoin. Most trivial alt's may likely get absorbed by Bitcoin via pegs/sidechains/merge mining but for select alts (and the crypto ecosystem in general) to remain robust the important ones will more than likely (and should) stay independent.
