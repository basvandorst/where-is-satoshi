How does this work with an offline wallet that has nothing but a paper backup? For example, when people keep sending a little here and there to their offline wallet for savings?

I'd imagine I'll have to either recycle or sell, PM me for info on buying one.

What about not accepting anything larger than $20's?

Coinbase. I just finished buying back BTC in Gox since 8 weeks of waiting with no deposit was long enough. Sorry about the price spike.

IF by mining you mean free, then it's still not free, but you can have a positive ROI if you get a good ASIC mining device. A promosing company is kncminer.com
One the hardware is paid for and you cover your electricity costs, then sure, you'll end up with "free" bitcoins.

While I can agree it's tough to refuse 2 free miners, maybe contact Jody back and let her know what happened and offer to send them back (AT BFL's expense), She may say not to worry about it and keep them, and you can keep a clean conscience :-)

Look, BFL is a hardware company, while mining on all those asics might seem like a lot of cash for us, there's a lot more cash in selling hardware. Why? Aside from the arms race and breast implants, there's not many industries where the more units you sell, the more units you have to sell. All other electronics, TV's, cell phones, laptops, once everyone has one, your sales drop. Mining rigs? Once everyone has one, everyone needs another one. The more hardware you sell, the higher the demand.

Haha, yes, we do payday loan accounts.

My buddy just got to his office and saw the price drop, he jumped. I wish he'd seen this post. He should be okay since he works in his parent's basement.

Best decision is to buy on credit card, now they can chargeback as *Item received not as described* "I bought a $1250 Bitcoin, the seller delivered to me a $595 bitcoin, I want my money back"
