How much did Roger pay them to post that?


Thanks for educating them about our Bitcoin and what it can do (effectively bypass currency controls). No wonder they're cracking down &gt;:(

Third thread about supersizing blocks. Do we really need to listen to all this unsubstantiated block enlargement propaganda from R0ger's own website?

China giveth, China taketh away... Free-falling. $714. No bottom.
Hold me, OP?

[Oh god oh God OH GOD!!]( There's no bottom, is there? Or is there?  Like staring into a black abyss with probably snakes at the bottom, vertigo!

You're telling me BTC is down from 5 years ago? Because gold sure is.
@_date: 2016-11-03 16:50:25
Nothing funny about it, op, price is plummeting :(

No dinner; no kiss.

There's a slight chance that the China thing is just fud. Try to stay calm.
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:00:17
Sorry, not interested in clueless clowns fighting for me. 


Remind me who tf you are again? We clearly have a history, you know so much about me...


Eww, NO!
@_date: 2016-11-17 19:35:12
No wonder no one's buying BTC over there.

According to that diabolically duplicitous Mr. Ver and his toadying sycophants it was. According to honest, trusted sources it never took place. 
Hmm... Whom to believe? :|

Just hope with Bitcoin under attack, Chinese fat cats don't move all their money into that anonymous coin with the Moscow Metro logo, the one that's up 7% today. I'm a little bit frightened, tbh...
@_date: 2016-11-03 21:01:23
...and now BFX below 700. How is such a thing possible?!
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:43:05
The whole website is just one giant fat block propaganda colossus. Do you honestly expect me to sift through your dangerous lies?
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:26:37
[Looks that way](
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:09:47


Anti-bitcoin brainwashing site full of dangerous lies?? Belonging to the notorious crypto criminal Roger Ver, Bitcoin public enemy  Bite your tongue, fiend! 
Each click on bitcoin[dot]com is another coin in the enemy coffer! You're literally funding your own demise :(
@_date: 2016-11-04 23:53:25
Because Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:02:07
And here they come, the bought-and-paid-for Ver downvoting brigade, downvoting me for just being honest and daring to foil their fiendish ploy :(
Why do you hate free speech so much, r/btc enemies of Bitcoin? Why do you hate the truth?
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:10:29
It's not the size, it's the rate of decline. Dizzying. 
Wouldn't be half bad if the bottom was in, but looks like there ain't no bottom... [$712.57]( :'(
@_date: 2016-11-07 01:00:59


In other words... Bitcoin user not affected?
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:52:03
Yes I'm new, and already [down -5.26%]( just today! How'm I gonna tell the missus?
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:46:08


Bitcoin [dot] com?! Doesn't that site belong to the well-known Bitcoin saboteur, Roger Ver?
