I'm confused, do they think the customer will pay the transaction fees? 
Also $3000 he is getting ripped off. He needs to negotiate with his POS payment tech provider. I pay 1.5% for CC, so 3000 is $200,000 a month, $2.4 million a year. Which is possible with the high COGS of restaurants

I'm not interested in conspiracy, nor do I have the time.
It's easy to manipulate a trading system when you can set prices. You can create up and down swings in price, and use or to your advantage. 
There are an unbelievable amount of regulations to keep mom and pop investors safe. Think about Insider trading regulations, market timing, whatever look them up. Rules the don't allow ponzi schemes. Look at bitconnect, a regulated market WOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED SO MANY PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. There are hundreds+ of regulations to keep people from getting fucked.
again, if you think regulations are bad, enjoy the destruction of your crypto

Yea, I never read the article (guilty) but I assume it was adds relating to crypto. 
I'm shocked, looks like it would be a good source of ad income. Shit I don't want to miss out on my Playboy Bunny coin. Right fellow HODLrs
@_date: 2018-03-22 03:06:30
Sure, the bitconnect ponzi scam would have not screwed so many people if the market was regulated. 
Regulations protect people from others taking advantage.

Really? It's $19k again?

But advertising brings Bitcoin to attention. Without attention, you don't get inflow of buyers. Without new buyers it's like a ponzi scheme

Yup. Dumb money ran In. Smart money tried to take advantage. That had its limits and dumb money realized they still had to pay they bills. Smart money sees the party is over, pulls their money a the price drops from $9000 to $5000.

A company that does shit, that isn't replaceable, like the 2000 other crypto currencies started by anyone. This argument is so sad, you lost bud, money gone

Exactly. But peak interest has been reached back in December. Peoples attention is fickle
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:11:00
I'm assuming they make money on the trade. Investors take the risk of loss. They don't care if you win or lose, that's why they charge you ahead of time, not only if you earn a profit

Just saying that it's an indication of the kind of dumb, animal behaviour, money is a going into this. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:41:15
You know, not all regulations mean "stop you from using it"
Mostly they would regulate the market, so that dummies don't get taken advantage of people manipulating the system, as is happening now. Regulations protect normal people from the much more conniving scammers. 
Enjoy your "free market"

You should tell everyone they should hold, even buy more! That will make things better
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:05:22
I've been saying for a while that the decline will continue to $5k, then buyers and sellers will match, and the price will be horizontal for a while. 
The real winners are the traders. They make money regardless of the price, and on every single transaction. There are no standards applied to them, there are no regulations, those guys are in the wild west. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 02:40:17
CC don't charge 2.5-3.5 at all
The CC will charge a fee of 1.5%, then whoever provides the debit machines will charge their own. This added price is easily negotiated. 1.65% is a reasonable amount for anyone but getting screwed

It's literally always been a gamble. When was it ever an investment, when people were throwing money at something they didn't understand, and it does being an investment when they realized that they were the last one to the gang bang?

It's called dollar loss averaging. I'm not sure if this phrase has been used before, but my idea goes like this, as the price crashes, sell some off to minimize your total losses. Pretty smart right

Long term view based on what economics? Based on a gamble that somehow collectively the world will lose its mind more than it did between the dates of Dec 15 2017 and Dec 25 2017? 
Holding is the reaction of an individual that can't face their losses. An individual that bet more than they could lose. Yes, selling will cement those losses, but not selling now is putting off today's losses for larger ones in a month. 
I saw people on this thread recommending people take their savings account, buy Bitcoin, then every cheque take a part of it and buy Bitcoin instead of saving. Foolproof! Those morons are never coming back. Not after this. Not after how painfully obviously stupid this all was. 
Everyone go home, party is done, take an advil and drink a Gatorade, you can laugh about it in a few years when the pain is just a memory.

Sold all mine at $1300, 4 years back.
Dropped to $500. Told everyone to sell at $19k. Never bought. 
I'm content. I made my money, could have made a lot more, but as I tell everyone any day I woke up to any price above $1300, I would have sold, because the economics weren't there. That's when there were only 5 different cryptos. Now... Shit, what a shitshow
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:56:32
Sure wouldn't want any evil regulation to prevent this kinda manipulating
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:48:30
Sweet, well lucky for you there is an article about it dropping to $50 dollars from the past. This way no matter what, you can suppress your feelings of anxiety about spending real money to buy real 0's and 1's
Crypto has become a joke. Garlicoin, bunnycoin, bitconnect, Jesus, Money is supposed to be simple, trading my money from Canadian to USD is a big enough pain in the ass. 
This crypto is a fad.
