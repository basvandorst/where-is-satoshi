I didn’t say I only had $10 to buy BTC? I’m not using it as an investment. I thought I made that clear. I have a few yearly subscriptions that take BTC as a payment method, that maybe comes out to a little over $50 a year. I want enough in my wallet to cover that and a little more, just incase. The $10 a paycheck I mentioned more than covers everything I need it for by the time those renewals roll around. I don’t need $1000s of dollars in BTC. It’s honestly not an investment opportunity that interests me.

This is the answer I was looking for. Thank you. Instead of doing small contributions, I’ll just do one large one and then hold off for a while. I haven’t been following the market enough. I just wasn’t sure if a bunch of smaller contributions allowing for fluctuation overtime would have been more worthwhile than having nothing in there since I would only need to do a larger contribution a lot less often.

I've only actually purchased once so far so I wasn't too sure actually. I just went to buy some, just to see. It looks like if I try to buy $10 or less it's a $.99 fee, anything up to $26 was a $1.49 fee, up to like $50 was $1.99, up to $200 was $2.99 and then after that it seemed like it went more to a percentage.

How little is too little of an amount to spend on BTC before the fees make it "not worth it"? I don't really plan on buying as an investment, but I have a few yearly expenses that I pay for with BTC. Is it worth it to ever do like $10 a paycheck into my coinbase account so it builds up overtime until these yearly expenses come around? Or should I split it up and do like $50 every couple of months instead of $10 every 2 weeks?
