I suppose if that one thing is enough to negate all of the good things he does for STEM and the fact that if one of his videos were about crypto, it would open it up to a new audience, then I suppose that's a thing you could do. I sorta see that as throwing the baby out with the bath water move, but beliefs and opinions are tricky and I wouldn't presume to tell you you're wrong.

I think he's saying "if you aren't willing to learn about this esoteric technology then you will be punished by paying more". It's a shit attitude and will ensure people like my mother will never use Bitcoin.

I think this elitist attitude is a limitation on adoption, if that's something that interests you.

Look, I agree that this is not great (if true - I know he's religious), but I think in some cases it's reasonable to overlook some things when you consider the wider perspective:
1. He does a lot for STEM regardless of a corner of science he doesn't present or address.
2. The impact on you or society of this personal belief of his is 0. This would potentially not be the same if it were a politician, for example.
In summary, I'd say that your statement is similar to [whataboutism]( that is so prevalent these days. OP pointed out Destin is interested in crypto, but you followed it up with something unrelated. Let's keep it on topic and not try and discredit a statement with another unrelated one.
