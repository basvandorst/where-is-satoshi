Adding to the "unaffected" data:
If I understand another comment in this thread: apparently if you never verified or added documentation to  your Bitfinex account, you were never forced to undergo the Bitgo account setup. 
 
A few days ago I sent bitcoins to a deposit address to fund my Bitfinex account. I just pulled the address to check it on Blocktrail.  My bitcoins have not been stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:59:41
How would you withdraw BTC in that case?  For instance, I checked my Bitfinex deposit-address that I sent BTC to few days ago from my personal wallet, all my Bitfinex BTC were safe from the hack.  You're not implying there's a way I can access them while Bitfinex is still down?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:50:53
I did not margin trade. And to clarify: I did not activate anything pertaining to BitGo, which is my very fragile theory as to why my coins are safe.

The difference is that the entire pillar of DOA - literally one the only sentences on their terms - was "the code is law"  &amp; "there are no terms other than the code".  The investors in the DOA assumed that a team of kickstarters could write infallible code on the first try and never perform a security patch for the next X years - all-the-while touting the immutability of the code.
The "code is law, except when it's not." is why people hated the DOA bailout.  
Completely different: Bitfinex was not "code is law" there were human checkpoints, there were human agreements, there are human liabilities and (what seems to be some level of deception).  Noone put money into Bitfinex with the assumption that they were forfeiting the protections of the legal system and the numerous times it was implied that their funds were insured / not kept in one giant fuckup hotwallet.
Disclosure: about 10% of my bitcoin holdings were in Bitfinex.  I also held ETH at the DOA fiasco, but no DOA tokens.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:08:02
Full disclosure: I am in the exact same situation as you; the "deposit" addresses I deposited my bitcoin in were not affected by the hack.
"None of **my** coins were stolen."  &lt;- that's the issue here.
They were not your bitcoins. You (and I) have been holding an IOU from Bitfinex for the past [insert how long you've been using Bitfinex].  The coins at [ were not and are not your coins.  It's just the address that proved Bitfinex has coins to back-up their IOU. 
Yes, Bitfinex is legally obligated to shore-up their IOU to you.  
It seemed like every 2 weeks that the top-post on was a PSA saying "any coins for which you do not hold the private key are not your bitcoins".
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:32:01
I know that using the same address more than once to *send* bitcoins is dangerous because it makes it easier to calculate your private key, but re-using addresses to *recieve* doesn't. 
So know I'm wondering, does sending bitcoins to yourself somehow compromise private keys similarly?
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:46:30
You can't consolidate those 64 transactions off the blockchain.  And to consolidate them on the blockchain would be the same thing as "sending them to yourself"  (i.e., you'd have to pay the same fees as the expensive transaction you were trying to avoid).
Here's a great resource explaining fees and inputs:
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:52:04
This is the best description of inputs and outputs that I've found.  Not the video, but the diagrams below. 
Think of Bitcoin as a series of treasure chests.  When you send bitcoins to someone, you're sending them the key to open that chest.  Your bitcoin wallet is simply a collection of X chests that you have the keys to.  Each chest has a different amount of btc within.
When you send a transaction for say 8 btc, you either send 1 chest that you control that has 8 btc (1 input and 1 output), or if you don't have a chest with 8btc, create a *new* chest by emptying multiple of your chests (multiple inputs) into a larger chest that now equals 8 btc and sending it to the recipient (still only 1 output). 
Say you can get 9 btcs into a chest and send it, the 1 btc "change" left over is then sent to a "change" address that you control.

What jcoinner said. 
If you have 30-minutes to kill this is how I did it:
I manually created an 12-word seed with coinflips.  The 12th word had a 1/16 chance of working. 
I input the 12 words into my Ledger and got "ERROR invalid seed". 
So I replaced my 12th word with the next sequential word from the BIP-39 word-list. 
At maximum, I would have needed to do this 16 times. It worked for me on try 6. 
Now I have the most secure bitcoin seed possible. Completely generated with pencil, paper, and various coins for coinflipping.

The value of a bitcoin is being able to edit the gobal unhackable ledger. The tokens that allow you to edit the ledger are called bitcoins. After that? The "value" of Bitcoin is unlimited, because yes, it's purely built on people agreeing that it has value.

Completely safe.

You're missing the point.
We're saying there is a fundamental flaw in how we calculate inflation. It's a moving goalpost that understates how much inflation is actually occurring.
Imagine you strike a very unusual deal with a car dealership:  You pay $200,000 once, and they agree to give you a brand new Ferrari every 10 years for your entire life. Ferrari's retail for $100,000 - and you have a judge enforce the contract.
In 2020, you get a $100,000 Ferrari. Top of the line, quality engine, lasts a life-time. Takes 200 man-hours to produce.
By 2030 Ferrari starts making more-affordable consumer cars.   They still make the $100,000 car, but the next car you receive is a "brand new Ferrari, commuter-class sedan, retailing for $50,000". Gets a B+ for reliability. Takes 100 man-hours to produce
By 2040, Ferrari hits economic trouble and gets acquired by Toyota. The next year, you receive a brand-new Ferrari minivan - retail value of $15,000. This car typically only lasts 2-3 years before repairs are needed. Takes 25-man hours to produce.
In this scenario, your prize is still technically unchanged (analogous to the FED stating "there is no inflation").  The issue is, that the underlying good is being swapped out right under your nose for an inferior product and you have no recourse. You're getting swindled.
Same with the FED calculating inflation:
Blenders used to cost $100 in 1980.  They still cost $100 in 2019. "Inflation is right on target. "
That this stat isn't accounting for:
Blender in 1980 is made with all-steel components - built like a tank. Takes 10-man hours to produce. Lasts 30 years with no problem.
Blender in 2019 - made with all plastic components. Takes 0.25 man-hours to produce. Lasts about 1.5 years.
In the Feds eyes:
Baby Boomers could purchase a standard blender for $100.
"Millennials can also purchase a standard blender for $100!" (Though, to buy an all-steel blender that's a well-made durable model - that would costs $399).
Fed says: Inflation is 0%.
Your quality of life is slowly being drained year-by-year by the FED. They continue inflating your money until your quality of life remains stagnant or decreases.

I appreciate your points and they're well thought out, but they're missing the core point. All I see is "Audit audit audit, trust a 3rd party, put faith in the government and law". This means nothing if the government decides they want your gold and can seize it at will.

The bitcoin ledger itself is the first digital "single record of truth" that has ever existed. Kind of like in the old days, if you wanted something time-stamped you would post-mark it at the postoffice. 
Then again that could be counterfeited.
Now: you can take any document, etc, and "hash" it into the Botcoin ledger. Now you have a digital, unforgable proof that a document exisited at a certain time.
That itself is 1 of 1,000 new things that cryptocurrency allows that never existed before.

You might be under-appreciating how thin the "market depth" or "order book depth" is for Crypto, and *especially* BitcoinCash.  It's insanely shallow. This is also what people refer to as real liquidity (the ability to sell an asset quickly without incurring losses).
For instance: lets take Hitbtc, a global top-10 exchange for BCH by volume. You can see the current order-book here: [
* With this order-book, you would only be able to sell 4,000 BCH before you tanked the price by 10%.
* If you sold 50,000 BCH, you would tank the price from $421/BCH to $12/BCH and your average sale price would be $160.
* If you sold 650,000 BCH, you would tank the price to $0.62. Your average sale price would be $13. Bitmain would earn a \*whopping\* $8,960,000 from the sale of BCH which had the "appearance" of being worth $276,000,000.
* Put another way: If bitmain wanted to generate $9m USD by selling BCH, they would tank the price by 99.8% instantly on a top-10 global exchange.
Obviously, this is just one top-10 exchange.  But it's also assuming that people won't feed into the panic and sell when they see the price of BCH drop by 50% in 5 seconds.
Selling 1,000,000 BCH ($280MM BCH) would generate maybe $50mm if they're lucky, and it would permanently kill BitcoinCash almost instantly.

TL;DR: A merchant (through Bitrefill) will display 1 QR code on their Lightning Network invoice to the consumer.  
**If** they have a LN channel already open, then that LN channel will be used to buy the product.  If the consumer has no existing LN channel, then there's a backup embedded in the QR, such that it will use an on-chain transaction for the purchase, **and give the consumer the option to use the transaction's change-address** to set up a LN channel for future use for free. 
Implication:  Consumer can purchase a good **and** open a LN chanel simultaneously with 1 transaction and 1 mining fee.
User Experience is improved because they only have to scan 1 QR code and it JustWorks(tm) no matter if they already have a LN Chanel open with that merchant or not. 
This is a great idea.

If a real bull market returns, and we surpass $100,000 per coin .... I don't see an end in sight after that.  
The definition of Network effect is that the value of a network is *exponential* to the number of people in the network. In addition, the network *grows* exponentially.
The important thing is that Bitcoin is an all-or-nothing scenario.  We're either going to hit equilibrium at &lt;$300/coin or $10,000,000 per coin.  Either Bitcoin works as a currency, or it doesn't (and then is only used for crime).

Yes, but the important part: is that once you have your piece of the Bitcoin pie, no one can make your piece any smaller relative to the whole. No matter how far you decide to shift the decimal place.  When you buy a bitcoin, don't think of it as owning "1 bitcoin", think of it as owning 1/21,000,000th of the pie.  Breaking-down bitcoin to smaller decimals doesn't change that.
**This is different when** ***governments*** **print money, as they don't distribute it evenly across all their citizens.**  They use the money themselves to fund whatever they want.  This causes your "piece of the pie" to shrink relative to the whole.
**This is what is known as "inflation".**
Tomorrow, the government could print $1,000,000,000,000,000 USD and all the money in your bank account would be worth nothing.  The only reason they don't do this is because we trust our government and believe that they won't decide to do that.  Instead, we socially agree that 3% inflation per year is fair.   In venezuela, the government literally did this.  Times got tough, and the government said "fuckit", and printed so much money that all the money the citizen's held became worthless.  Then the economy collapsed. 
Tomorrow, we could all agree to shift the decimal place on bitcoins 1 digit, so now everyone has 10x the amount of bitcoin.  Nothing would happen. Everyone would still own the same fraction of the pie. Instead of paying 0.0003 bitcoin in miner fees, people would pay 0.003 bitcoin in miner fees.
In short: moving the decimal place in Bitcoin doesn't break anything.  Moving the decimal place in a FIAT currency breaks everything.

Most of us aren't trying to get rich in Fiat.
Many believe in the philosophy surrounding Bitcoin.
**I have some Bitcoin as an insurance policy.  Much like I also keep 3 gallons of fresh water in my home in-case my water gets shut off for the day.**  Likewise, I *always* have &gt;$1,000 of bitcoin permanently stored in my brain (memorized 12-word seed).  The fact that this is possible is mind-blowing. I could store $20,000,000 in my brain if I trusted my memory that much.
For those that aren't impressed by this, or don't appreciate how bitcoin works, this is different than "memorizing a password to login to coinbase to access my bitcoins".  The 12 words *are* *literally* my Bitcoins.
Small example of a bitcoin insurance policy that doesn't include the US dollar collapsing:
If I travel to Cuba and run out of whatever US cash I initially brought with me, I'm fucked.  You can't withdraw cash from a US bank account or receive a bank wire from America.  Now, I will always have enough Bitcoins to buy myself a plane ticket back to America no matter where I find myself in the world. (And before you ask, yes, you can actually use the bitcoins in Cuba to get cash - that's not just hopeful thinking).
Replying to "Stranded in cuba? That's an unlikely scenario": It happened last year to my American friend who went there on his Swedish passport.  He simply budgeted poorly, but could just as easily been pick-pocketed. He couldn't get a wire from his american bank account or from his family in Sweden. He didn't eat the last day so he would have cash for the cab to the airport.  This guy is a 25yo banker who makes over $200,000 per year. he's a smart well-connected guy. Got caught off guard.
**The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.**
* How likely is it that you become a victim of identity theft, and your bank freezes all your bank accounts? Similarly: Do you think it will get resolved in &lt;1 week? What if it doesn't, yet you need to pay rent? Buy food
* How likely is it that i get stuck in a foreign country without cash? (As described above, happens.)
* How likely is it that you may want to withdraw more cash from an ATM than your bank will allow in 1 day (for some people, this limit is literally $500?)
* How likely is it that Visa goes down for 3 days and your credit card stops working? (Like it did in the UK just last month)
* How likely is it that your bank makes a clerical mistake and accidentally locks/freezes your credit card?
* How likely is it that the government keeps printing more money causing rapid inflation and the value of FIAt currency to keep falling? (For Americans this is unlikely, but for other countries, it is inevitable).
And yes, many of these scenarios *could* be satisfied with cash. (disclosure I also have $500 in cash in my house for this exact reason). However, you can't store that in your brain and transport it on planes without questions. It can be confiscated, stolen, burnt, etc. Storing $100,000 in your house? Riskier.
Lastly: I don't think *that* many people living in India thought that it was *likely* that their government would spontaneously decree that **all cash-bills over $20 would become illegal** **overnight.** But it happened. and it caused a massive 2-month-long run-on the banks to exchange their now illegal $100 bills for cash. That happened less than 1 year ago.
People in America probably didn't think it was likely that the government would make owning gold illegal and confiscate your stash of gold. But it happened.
Nothing seems likely untill it occurs, then you're shit out of luck.
Bitcoin is a radically new element of our world - one of those benefits is an last-resort emergency cash stash that was never previously possible.

Improve efficiency by 15%, expenses drop to $85 (rounded). Profit shoots up to $15, a 1,500% improvement in profitability.
This is why a 15% efficiency boost could be a "winner take all" scenario and why Jihan would spend "more money than you can imagine" to resist change. Once you realize that Segwit disabled covert ASICBoost, it became a necessary critical upgrade for the health of the networth.

The value of insurance is the sum of thousands of unlikely situations in which it may become useful one day.
* How likely is it that i get stuck in a foreign country without cash?
* How likely is it that Visa goes down for 2 days and your credit card stops working? (Like it did in the UK just last month)
* How likely is it that you may want to withdraw more cash from an ATM than your bank will allow in 1 day (for some people, this limit is literally $500?
* How likely is it that your bank makes a mistake and accidentally locks/freezes your credit card?
* How likely is it that you become a victim of identity theft, and your bank freezes all your bank accounts? Similarly: Do you think it will get resolved in &lt;1 week?  What if it doesn't, yet you need to pay rent? Buy food?
* How likely is it that the UW government starts printing more money?
And yes, many of these scenarios *could* be satisfied with cash. (disclosure I also have $500 in cash in my house for this exact reason). However, you can't store that in your brain and transport it on planes without questions.  It can be confiscated, stolen, burnt, etc.  Storing $100,000 in your house? Riskier.
Lastly: I don't think *that* many people living in India thought that it was *likely* that their government would spontaneously decree that **all cash-bills over $20 would become illegal** **overnight.**  But it happened. and it caused a massive 2-month-long run-on the banks to exchange their now illegal $100 bills for cash. That happened less than 1 year ago.
People in America probably didn't think it was likely that the government would make owning gold illegal and confiscate your stash of gold.  But it happened.
Nothing seems likely untill it occurs, then you're shit out of luck.
Bitcoin is an insurance policy that the world has never seen before.  *One* of those qualities is a weird insurance policy which never existed until now.

I'd be careful not to tie "investor" with "innovator" in all ecosystems. The word "investor" has different meanings depending on the ecosystem.  Some systems need them, some don't.
For traditional companies, investors largely drive innovation with their capital. ("Investors" == "innovators").
For commodities, no innovation occurs when someone simply invests in gold.  (Investors are *only* investors, and do nothing to directly push innovation. Investor **=//=** innovator.)
For companies built *on top* of commodities, investors in gold-shipping, gold refining, and gold extraction *are* pushing innovation. (Investors == innovators)
Bitcoin needs innovators (developers, coders, startups) and investors in companies built on-top of Bitcoin.  We don't *need* people pushing the price upwards for no reason. The money going into a Bitcoin ETF will not go to developers, coders, or startups.  It would be nice to have a Bitcoin ETF, but isn't worth sacrificing privacy and sacrificing what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
The goal is to fund innovators (aka developers). Not fund speculators.

"none of the scenarios above are stopping you from purchasing bitcoin when you need it."
Think critically about what I typed. Don't just think "how can I prove this guy wrong" - because you can't read my post and then logically say that.
Your reply is like saying: "Why do you store emergency drinking water in your house?  When the water gets shut-off during a hurricane, you can just run to the store and buy drinking water when you need it." - it doesn't make sense. You must have the stash in-place *before* the need arises.
\- If your bank account is frozen, bitcoin would only help you if you *already* had a stash of them. You can't buy bitcoin if your bank account is frozen.
\- If you're trapped in a foreign country and someone steals your wallet. Bitcoin would help you.  How are you going to buy bitcoin in a foreign country at that point "now that you need it"?
\- If the IRS wrongly seized your assets (this happens all the time), then takes 3-months of lawsuits to clear-up, how are you going to pay for things?  How are you going to pay for $40,000 in legal expenses? Buying bitcoin at this point would not only be impossible (considering your frozen assets), but it also wouldn't solve anything to use your small remaining cash to buy bitcoin.
\- If you really want it, there was a great article written by a blogger and computer-science teacher.  He accepted Adsense advertisements on his blog from some online casino banner-ad.  Little did he know, that one of the advertisements was paid for by a Russian which had ties with the mafia.  The FBI raided his house, seized his computer, and accused him of accepting funds from the mafia, and pegged him as a cohort.   The article describes how helpless he was in this scenario.
They froze his bank account and seized the assets in his home.  They gave him a plea-bargain of 1-year in prison.  He hired a lawyer, but couldn't afford the 6-month legal battle. He literally almost took the plea bargain because he didn't have access to his money.  He cashed-out his bitcoin to pay for his lawyers. He was found innocent.   I can find the article if you want, but will take some time.

I get where you're coming from.  
But ownership is a social construct and the 'rights' associated with that construct (i.e. protection through the court system). However, in Bitcoin, ownership **is** the private keys.  **There is currently no effective recourse for stolen bitcoins.**
I think it would be extremely misleading to newbies to imply if your private keys are stolen, that "owning" the Bitcoins that a thief controls means anything.
I get that it's not technically correct, for it communicates the finality of bitcoin and how hopeless your situation becomes without the private keys.
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:31:49
I'm not familiar with btc.com specifically. Do you have to log in to btc.com through a browser or app to access the wallet? Does btc.com have access to your private keys? If they do, then you are not safe to the risks outlined above.
2FA (99%) protects you from a *malicious login*, not from a malicious hack on btc.com's servers. It also doesn't protect you if a btc.com employee steals your bitcoin and leaves the county. It also doesn't protect you in the government orders btc.com to freeze your account. In all of these scenarios your bitcoins disappear with no effective recourse.

It depends on the lawsuit. Bitfinex lost $70million in bitcoin. Ultimately I don't think they haircut fiat. 
At the time there was a lot of debate from Bitfinex on socializing losses. They even considered conficating Ethereum from ethereum traders to offset the btc losses. Ultimately they did not do this. But there's no "rule" against it. After losing $70m, that fiat sitting in their control starts looking pretty nice in a lawsuit scenario.

This is fine for convenience.  But it's entirely possible that your coins disappear tomorrow. 
The reason I make these warning posts every few months is because I saw a similar warning post on Reddit, decided to download Breadwallet for IOS, and transfer 90% of my bitcoins out of Bitfinex.  5 days later Bitfinex was hacked and $70m of bitcoins were stolen.

Because if the answer is just "increase blocksize from 1mb to 2mb", that increases the speed at which the blockchain grows in size every day... Right now the blockchain is 105gb. This makes it harder for normal users to store the blockchain, thereby making bitcoin becomes less decentralized.
Recall, that users need to store the blockchain forever.  As it grows, it can never be reduced in size. 
Their solution is also not a longterm or scalable solution. We have 3 transactions per second right now.  DOUBLING the blocksize will increase this to 6 per second... which really is not that much.  These 2x larger blocks will be full again in no time at all.  8x larger blocks will be full in no time.
That's why CORE is proposing solutions to fit more transactions into each MB through Segwit.  In addition, Segwit then allows much more innovative solutions, such as the lightning network, which offers unlimited transactions per second between two parties.
That's why people are against increasing the blocksize.  It's a bandaid.  Not only is it a bandaid, but it is starting to look like the "bigger block" people are ignoring real and innovative solutions that could massively aid in bitcoin's development.

Everything Skaska23 said is extremely reasonable.
I work on Wall Street. Stocks are 100% in the "TINA " phase of investment strategy.
AKA "Our fund is currently investing in the market, overweight in equities but 'cautiously bullish' right now because ... **T**here **I**s **N**o **A**lternative."
Everything is horseshit right now.  The market is staying up because people *need* to be in the market - not because it's the right thing to do.  There's no where attractive to put capital.  They're just parking it. No one has the balls to tell their investors: "We're exiting the market and overweight in cash right now".  The small agile funds are doing that, but behemoth pension fund advisers?  Try getting a contrarian investment strategy of that nature past the investment board.
The fund manager's incentives are misaligned and it keeps them in the market, even during TINA.
Keeping money in the market even while it's horseshit is begrudgingly a win-win for them:
1. If the delusion crashes, and markets drop, they can say "poor returns due to unseen market movements" and they're in-line with every other fund.
2. If the delusion continues, and they miss out on an additional 4% return over the next 12 months?  They lose their positions as heads of the firm, and ridiculed for fucking up.
Buffet: "The markets can stay delusional longer than you can stay liquid".
The markets are delusional.  Everyone is cautiously optimistic.  Which just means: "Where is that fucking catalyst we all know is coming?"  "What big name is going to exit the market and start this downturn".  
Name one bloodbath downturn wherein the general investment community *wasn't* "cautiously optimistic" right before the crash.

Regarding the Buffet quote not applying to hedge funds: Hedge funds don't have to worry about *financial* liquidity in the same way an individual investor does, but the hedge fund *manager* has to worry about "going bust" - aka getting fired/replaced for losing 4% during a bull-run.
Losing 4% won't make the hedge fund collapse.  But it may cause the manager to be replaced, or compensation to be stripped.
Betting against the market, then getting fired/ridiculed/reduced-compensation as a result is equivalent to "going bankrupt".

You're thinking that there is 1 *actual* bitcoin price.  This is where you're confused.
What is the price of a bushel of wheat?  It may be $5 in Chicago and $4.50 in Texas.  It just depends on each local market "finding" the price for itself.   The global "price of wheat" would be an average of these, and would be quoted at $4.75/bushel.
Similarly, the price on Coinbase and Robinhood are different, since they're separate "location" of buyers and sellers.
When you log onto CoinMarketCap, that website simply takes the average Bitcoin price over 500+ markets.
Theoretically, you could buy bitcoin on Coinbase, then transfer it to Robinhood, then sell it there and make a profit. 
However, the friction of fees, and time delays usually prevents you from making any meaningful cash doing this.

Bank 2 now has $84,000 in deposits and can lend 84% of it ($70,560) to Barbara.

Basically - if this kicks off a bull run then we're good. If not, then the hangover of this could be bad. 
The last 2 times Bitfinex panic happened, we were in a bull-market, and it was honestly a huge catalyst.

Bank lends $81 to billy so he can buy a boat.
Boat-Store gets $81 and deposits it the Bank.
Bank holds 10% back $8 as reserves, and can make a new loan for $73.
The $100 initial deposit has magically turned into $90 + $81 + $73 (total $244) in the economy, which is off-set by the $9+$8+$7 (total $24) in reserves.
This $100 has turned into $268 dollars. $168 dollars were created out of this air in the form of debt instruments.  When this debt is deposited in the bank, it instantly becomes a clear deposit again.

I think what he's saying is: being nice to people on a bitcoin forum is a win-win scenario. Being hostile is a lose-lose scenario.
"Being nice" worst-case scenarios: 
(1) They might be an "authentic" noob, and you've helped them out by being nice and supportive and helpful. And you have helped bitcoin.
(2) they might be an unintelligent newb and lazy. Worst case scenario: you've helped them out by being nice and supportive and helpful. Other authentic newbies are helped alongside. And you've helped bitcoin.
(3) ...they're government agents... (?).  Ok. Still applies. Being nice worst case scenario: You've shown that bitcoiners are helpful people, and you really haven't given a government agent anything they didn't already know about bitcoining. So this scenario is pretty irrelevant.

I get what you're saying, but you have to realize that when you "privately adjust the difficulty down for your own private chain" (and then mine 1000 blocks), the difficulty you used is essentially captured in the hash of the block (the number of consecutive 0's in the hash).
So while yes, you will have a chain that is 1,000 blocks longer than the rest of the network, your blocks will be invalid because the "proof of work" you did to hash those blocks will be , for lack of a better term, recorded in each block you mine.  AKA, everyone can see the difficulty that you used to mine those blocks.  They will not fit the consensus of the agreed-upon difficulty, and everyone will realize that your blocks are invalid.
So, in essence, all 1000 of your blocks will stamped to say: "mined on a private hardfork that does not match the agreed-upon difficulty".

There is only 1 question you need to ask yourself:  How likely do \*you\* think it is that Tether Inc. is holding $2.5 billion USD in a bank account earning 0.05% interest.  How likely is it that someone can tolerate doing absolutely nothing with $2.5 billion.
Tether holders can lose value if Bitfinex takes the USD deposits and buys a lambo instead of leaving it in their bank account. Or if they spend the USD on literally anything.
Or if the government freezes/confiscates their bank account?  Tether is worthless overnight. You think the government is going to pay you $2.5billion for your tether? They don't even know what Tether is. And if they did - they'd hate it even more.
Tether is vapor.  It is backed by a promise from an overseas CEO saying "trust me".  This is not even FUD, it's literally what people signed up for when they started using Tether.  This isn't a secret. The value of Tether holds up as long as people think it has value.  People are going to keep riding that knife's edge for convenience until something goes wrong.

Yeah I see that, and you're also in a better position to judge Sheena's level of involvement.
That being-said, my take-away is this: 
In her mind, Bitcoin still has absolutely nothing to offer her. She still thinks of it as a complicated credit card that works internationally somehow.  
I agree with you: the problem is, she's only interested in "is this going to be better for me than a credit card for my daily life?" and the answer to this question is: no. **Bitcoin is not better for Sheena than a credit card for convenience.**
That's why you need to lead the conversation.  Bitcoin is more than a complicated internet credit card.  It allows half of the world that is currently un-banked access to financial tools, this is a Swiss bank in your pocket, etc. Yes, these ideas are "cool to you and me, but not to Sheena" - but it's also the only value Bitcoin currently has. If Sheena doesn't find this appealing and is only interested in credit card convenience - then Bitcoin is not ready to sway her yet.
Getting people to invest in Bitcoin is to convince them that "Bitcoin is **incredibly** inconvenient, and momentously difficult to use, but remarkably powerful".  In my opinion, the shining-moment of this podcast is when you referenced the early email analogy.  You just needed to follow-through with the "incredibly powerful" part!
Hope to see you continue to make content!  Bitcoin is incredibly difficult to explain to beginners - the more the merrier! Thanks!

@_date: 2017-01-20 22:29:46
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but my laymans' understanding is as follows:
The "bug" doesn't offer security holes, per se, but it makes it very difficult to build systems on top of transactions if they can shift slightly.
For instance.  Lets take a bitcoin transaction where the data says "send bob 1 bitcoin". Now, *without SegWit* there's a scenario where the transaction might end up saying "send 1 bitcoin to bob" instead. 
 Now, both of these transactions send 1 bitcoin to bob, but the messages have the possibility of changing slightly. The transaction system isn't "broken", and it still works perfectly fine, but if you want to built a system on top of the transactions, you need to keep the messages from shifting unpredictably.

Exchanges are not evil - but people need to know that they aren't invincible either. Thats all.
If you could store bitcon in a bank insured by the FDIC, your comment would make sense. But exchanges are not banks, your deposits are not insured by the federal government against losses. Exchanges are websites. 
Equating an exchange to a bank is an easy mistake - and highlights that these posts are still necessary. You're giving your bitcoins to a start-up internet company and assuming that is a risk-free decision.

KYC in the financial world is short for Know Your Customer. It refers to a legal obligation of financial service providers (typically banks or lenders) to make sure they aren't lending money to ISIS, or accidentally facilitating money laundering, etc. 
For Bitcoin it's significant because some people trading BTC might not be accounting for their taxes correctly, also, some people use bitcoin for illegal purposes. KYC really only has 1 chance to record information about you, and thats on the FIAT to BTC onboarding phase. Once you're on BTC and transacting in BTC, anonymity is much more substantial.  I.e. what happens in cash every day.

I generally agree with you in that BTC_Forever is overreacting a bit.  However, using an exchange is not the same as a bank.  Banks are insured by the federal government in case of a loss, exchanges are not.
An exchange owner can (no exaggeration) actually just steal your funds and go into hiding. In the case of a hack, yes, you're legally entitled to the bitcoin you held at the exchange.  But the exchange can just declare bankruptcy and you wont see your funds for 5+ years if ever.

There is currenlty a block reward of 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes which contributes to the miner's "revenue".  This equates to $56,250 every block.  Including this as a transaction fee is incorrect.

At this point, you can load-up your wallet with bitcoins.  You can now throw your iphone into the toilet now.  Buy a new iphone, download breadwallet, to go "recover a wallet", and type-in your 12 words.  The wallet with perform the cryptography I described above, re-sync with the blockchain, and you'll have your bitcoins.

Love the idea - and have to say, there's a lot of room for improvement here.  Sadly, this podcast didn't really mention 1 **genuine** benefit of bitcoin. This entire podcast, to a newbie, translates as: "bitcoin is more convenient that you probably thought, but still more complicated than your credit card". 
Her main reply: "Bitcoin just seems really complicated, I really only notice something when my credit card gets rejected".
The rest was back-and-forth jokes because she was mildly uncomfortable, didn't know what questions she should be asking, and wasn't getting any useful information from the Sherpa.  As-if you sat your mother infront of a computer scientist and say "ok mom, ask this guy whatever questions you have about TCP/IP protocol".  You mom really doesn't care, or even know what questions to ask, so she just makes computer jokes with him for 8 minutes and says "oh yeah, it's all so complicated".
The final question "would you let me help you buy bitcoin?"  "oh.  yeah.  I mean sure."
Next time, lead the conversation and put more focus on the amazing elements of Bitcoin: "You can BE your own bank, travel anywhere in the world and carry $1-$1,000,000 on a piece of paper, or better yet, a brainwallet you carry in your own mind."   Tell her about Greece where the goverment hair-cut every bank-account in the nation to pay for debts.  Tell her about India banning bank-notes and the riots that caused.  Tell her that this is the only currency that isn't backed by a government.  Tell her that there's no such thing as "the bitcoin company" that decides the rules for this currency.  Tell her someone figured out how to created a digital asset that than can not be copy and pasted.  Tell her that Bitcoin gets millions of strangers on the internet to unanimously decided on 1 unchangeable single source of truth.
Without any of that, many noobs will still think: "Some company is printing internet money, and for some reason it's increasing in value."

The electricity consumed actually has no relation to the number of transactions. Transactions could stay the same, but as long as it's profitable to do so, mining will increase indefinitely. This increase in mining power is then counteracted by the "difficulty increases".  It's purely driven by how profitable it is to mine.
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:05:33
That's a great counter-point. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:36:26
Ah - Although it would seem to be the case, more transactions actually *does not* mean more blocks. Put simply, the global bitcoin mining currently finds approximately 1 block per 10 minutes. If more transactions attempt to happen than can fit in that 1block, then transactions have to wait for the next block. 
Now, lets say someone doubled the total bitcoin mining power tomorrow. Then, youre right, there would be approximately 1 block mined every 5 minutes. The number of transactions allowed on the bitcoin network would double. HOWEVER, this "5 minute block discovery" only lasts for two weeks at most. Every 2 weeks, the bitcoin code re-evaluates the difficulty of mining and changes it such that 1 block is discovered every 10 minutes (in our example it would automatically double the difficulty to mine). This results right-back at the 10-minute blocktime we had before. So suddenly the transaction volume snaps-back to where it was before, even though the mining power of the network remains doubled.
In your initial question, you're putting the cart before the horse. The transaction volume has zero relation to the energy expenditure used for bitcoin. People mine to generate bitcoin. **As long as it's profitable and people can keep finding cheaper electricity, bitcoin mining power will keep going up forever.** Not only is the number of transactions irrelevant, more-so transactions theoretically can never increase past the 1 block every 10 minutes. This is why scaling solutions are such a big debate in bitcoin, and what the Lightning Network aims to solve.

When people say "invest what you can afford to lose".  I think it's also useful to say "I am going to lose money on this investment, but it will be a massive learning experience on Crypto-currency which will impact the world in the future."
That being said: Go buy $1000 through an exchange to get your feet wet.  
Then that will incentivize you to research. You'll learn about cryptography. Then you'll read Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. You'll realize that Bitcoin is more than just *internet money*, but more like an entirely new version of the internet. You'll then realize holding your bitcoins on an exchange is dangerous.  Then you'll research how to safely store your own bitcoins.
At this point you'll be hooked.

Google is your best friend.  And I'm not just saying that to be snarky.  Google "how to store bitcoin" and you'll see multiple options: paper wallets, mobile wallets, hardware, etc.
Be sure to do research on things like: "what makes a good password"? "why are brainwallets a terrible idea"? What happens if you wipe your phone? Does rooting my phone compromise my iphone's encryption (tip: yes it does)?  
Bitcoin is a revolutionary invention, and exchanges are a great loading-point for new users.  However, the revolutionary *benefits* of bitcoin do not exist until you leave the exchange.

The value of a bitcoin is that owning one gives you the ability to edit/write on the first global, immutable, decentralized ledger.  The first use for this ability seems to be as a currency, but there are more uses which have not been developed yet. Accessing the global ledger is bitcoin's intrinsic value.
Much like asking: "what is the *intrinsic value* of connecting the first 3 computers to the internet"?  There is no intrinsic value in connecting them, but there is utility which can be accessed to generate value.  So the "network effect" is what gives the internet value, it has no intrinsic value on its own.

You can recover your bitcoins without the app if you really need to.
I am NOT qualified to explain this to anyone, but here's the ELI5 for the complex answer: The 12-word seed basically gets put into a standard hashing function, which then deterministicly generates you with private-keys for each transaction. 
The Bread Wallet app does this all for you.  But in a dooms-day scenario you could perform the same standard hashing function on the 12-word seed to recover your private keys.

For instance, Breadwallet will generate a wallet for you, and then will give you a 12-word "seed" which was used to crypotographically generate the private keys that the app uses behind-the-scenes.  Write these 12-words down and protect it just like you would a private key. If your phone is ever lost or stolen, just re-download Breadwallet and type-in the 12-word seed. The app will re-populate with your info.   
This 12-word seed is cryptographically used to retrieve your private key.  What this means is that you don't even have to rely on Breadwallet persisting. If the Breadwallet app is deleted from the app store and your phone forever - you still don't lose your bitcoins. The 12-word seed can still recover your private keys without the app, you just need to apply the same math to the key manually and it will retrieve your private keys..

Funny comparison.  Assuming for a moment that the Biblical prophesies of Revelation are "true" and we believe in them:
If KYC/AML banks are "the mark of the beast", and Bitcoin is attempting to thwart them - then this is a terrible prediction for Bitcoin since the Bible basically states that the Mark of the Beast will ultimately "win" and prevail on this world.
The only way that Bitcoin "wins" in this "end-of-days" comparison is if Bitcoin *is* the mark of the beast and dominates the world. 
So, maybe not the best idea to invoke biblical prophecies in the case of Bitcoin. Unless of course you want to make a deal with the devil and ride the bitcoin price to $10,000,000/btc as it dominates the world and becomes the mark of the beast... :p

The transaction you linked implies that  he only ever intended to send you 0.00001 BTC.  Even though the explorer says that the "entire transaction" was worth 0.0046 BTC, he intentionally only sent you 0.00001 BTC, and whatever was left-over went back to the sender is what's known as a "change address".
Think of it as a piggybank.  His piggybank holds 10 BTC.  He wants to send you 0.1 BTC.  He breaks the entire piggybank, releasing all 10 bitcoins.  He sends you 0.1, then sends 9.9 Btc back into a new piggybank that he controls.

1. an exchange such as coinbase
   1. Invalid question - In this scenario, you never owned bitcoin to begin with.  Your bitcoin is owned by someone else. Literally anything could cause you to "lose" your bitconi.  For instance, if the CEO of Coinbase launders money, all bitcoin on Coinbase will likely be seized by the government. May take you 5-6 years to get it back.
2. hard wallet 
   1. For Laymen - just use a hardware wallet.  If you input your private key into any other electronic device - consider your bitcoins as good as gone.

I am not an expert, but am a well-read non-programmer bitcoin hobbyist. Based on my research, Breadwallet is reasonably safe.  
Essentially: Apple IOS encrytion is top-notch.  In addition, each app on the phone is "sandboxed" from one another, meaning malicious apps can't steal your bitcoins from Breadwallet.
However, you need to protect the 12-word "seed" that breadwallet generates and write it down somewhere safe.  This 12-word seed is essentially your private key (i.e. your bitcoins) and you use it to recover your wallet if your phone is lost or stolen. 
Searching post history for things like "breadwallet" is a great way to find discussions on the subject.

NKI—The European Central Bank will announce a package of stimulus measures at its next policy meeting in September that should exceed investors’ expectations, a top official at the central bank said.
Speaking in his offices in Finland’s capital on Thursday, Olli Rehn said the slowing global economy would see the ECB rolling out fresh stimulus measures that should include “substantial and sufficient” bond purchases as well as cuts to the bank’s key interest rate.
“It’s important that we come up with a significant and impactful policy package in September,” said Mr. Rehn, who sits on the ECB’s rate-setting committee as governor of Finland’s central bank.
“When you’re working with financial markets, it’s often better to overshoot than undershoot, and better to have a very strong package of policy measures than to tinker,” Mr. Rehn said.
Economic data from Germany and China on Wednesday showed two of the world’s economic powerhouses flagging amid headwinds in the global economy that range from trade tensions to the possibility of a disorderly Brexit.
ECB President Mario Draghi last month raised the prospect of fresh ECB action in September, but the new comments from Mr. Rehn indicate that the level of stimulus is likely to be at the upper end of analysts’ expectations.
Analysts expect the ECB will announce next month a 0.1 percentage-point cut to its key interest rate, currently set at minus 0.4%, as well as around €50 billion ($56 billion) a month of fresh bond purchases under its quantitative easing program. The program had previously been phased out at the end of last year.
By raising market expectations for the ECB’s September meeting, Mr Rehn’s comments could put pressure on any ECB policy makers critical of a large stimulus package to fall into line, said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist with Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva.
The comments suggest the ECB might cut interest rates by more than expected in September, perhaps by 0.2 percentage points, and could start to purchase new types of assets, Mr. Ducrozet said.
Eurozone government bond yields fell shortly after Mr. Rehn made his comments. The 10-year bund yield fell to a new low of -0.688%, while 10-year Italian BTP yields slid to 1.375%, a level last seen in October 2016, according to Tradeweb.
The ECB could also sweeten the terms of a new batch of long-term loans for banks by lowering their interest rate or extending their maturity, Mr. Rehn said.
A package of several measures “has a stronger impact than sequencing various measures over time,” due to synergies among different policy tools, Mr. Rehn said.
To provide space for fresh bond purchases, the ECB could adjust the rules of its bond-buying program, which currently prohibit the bank from buying more than 33% of the debt of any individual eurozone government, he added.
Mr. Rehn said he didn’t rule out a move to purchase equities under the QE program, but that would depend on the assessment of ECB staff.
He pointed to a range of risks threatening Europe’s economy, including the unstable political situation in Italy, China’s economic slowdown, uncertainties in the global economy caused by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and the possibility of a hard Brexit.
“In my view, there is a certain weakening of the economic outlook for Europe in the last couple of months,” Mr. Rehn said. That worsening economic backdrop “justifies taking further action in monetary policy, as we intend to do in September,” Mr. Rehn said.
A strong majority in the ECB’s rate-setting committee will likely favor an aggressive stimulus package, according to officials.
Investors currently expect the ECB to cut its key interest rate to minus 0.7% and to hold rates below their current level through 2024, according to futures markets. Mr. Rehn said those market expectations showed that investors had understood the ECB’s guidance.
To offset the impact on eurozone banks of a longer period of negative interest rates, the ECB could introduce a tiered-deposit system, under which only a portion of bank deposits might be subject to negative rates, Mr. Rehn said.
The ECB could also alleviate the stress on banks by sweetening the terms of new long-term loans, known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations, he said.
Mr. Rehn was considered one of the front-runners in the race to succeed Mario Draghi as ECB President earlier this year, a job that eventually went to International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde. The Finn was subsequently shortlisted by European officials in the race to succeed Ms. Lagarde at the IMF, but he withdrew his name earlier this month.

I'm a Bitcoin maximalist, and even I recognize that this answer is a resounding: No.
Decentralized crypto will ALWAYS be out-competed on convenience in favor of a centralized option.
The ONLY reason to hold a decentralized crypto is for censorship resistance, or to escape oppressive governments, or avoid inflation.

Google the origins of the phrase "white elephant" gift.
It's a "valuable" gift, so the recipient can't throw it away, but it's also something they don't really want and it inconveniences them.
Turn the situation around: Say your friend Bill was **really** into studying and speaking Japanese, so for your birthday he took $50 USD and converted it into $50 worth of loyalty points at his local Japanese languange instructor, but you need to attend 3 hour-long classes before you unlock the credit.
No matter how much Bill loves Japanese, it's kind-of a selfish and cringey gift and a weird attempt to force you to enjoy his hobby. A hobby he's probably tried to get you interested in before. You'd be asking yourself: man, I would've enjoyed a travel mug or $20 much more than this. I'll probably never use this.
Even though we love Bitcoin, someone receiving Bitcoin gifts out of the blue will view the situation very similarly. It also takes much more than 3 hours to understand Bitcoin enough to cash-out $50 a paper wallet back into USD.

Bitcoin is in a race.
The only point of a decentralized currency is: censorship resistance. (aka, avoiding the government). 
The race: Can bitcoin hit a critical mass, such that there's a self-sustaining economy before the government can clamp-down the onboarding ramps?
The issues you're describing are not issues with Bitcoin being "difficult". It's the banks not wanting to let you escape FIAT. 
The more difficult this becomes, you can take increased solace in the face that you've escaped the FIAT system.

2. Once bitcoin is stolen, there is no recourse, no hope to track it, no hope to retrieve it.
3. It can be stolen from you by some hacker 1/2 across the world who decided to target you.
The best equivalent is posting on the internet that you have $20,000 in cash under your bed. Or, wait 5 years, Bitcoin is $100,000 each.

The answer you don't realize you're looking for is "the petro dollar".
Every time a barrel of oil is sold anywhere in the world, they must first buy US dollars to purchase it. THIS is why every country needs US dollars in their reserves.
"That led to the creation of the petrodollar system, where the U.S. and Saudi Arabia agreed to set oil prices in U.S. dollars. That meant any other country that purchased oil from the Saudi government would have to exchange its currency into U.S. dollars before completing the sale. That led the remaining OPEC countries to follow suit and price their oil in U.S. currency."

I also watched the internet go from nothing to something. I know that technology can improve beyond our wildest dreams. That's does not apply to Bitcoin however. Since the force I'm referencing when I say "bitcoin will never be as convenient as a bank" is not caused by UI problem, or an infrastructure problem, or an App problem, or a lack-of companies problem ... or even an adoption problem.
The force at play that I'm referencing is an inherent *feature* of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin lets you to be your own bank.  That implies responsibility. That aspect of Bitcoin will ensure that it is NEVER as convenient as a FDIC-insured bank.  If you put your cash into a bank-you trade freedom for elimination of responsibility.
You can not own or use Bitcoin without taking responsibility of your own assets' safety.  Trusting a 3rd party is not Bitcoin ownership. It is a Bitcoin IOU. Using Coinbase is not "using Bitcoin" until you withdraw it to a wallet you control.
Cash is the best example:
Having $1,000 of emergency cash under your bed gives you freedom in-case of a natural disaster.  This is the inherent benefit of Cash.  Everyone should have some cash available to them in-case they need it. The trade-off: You now need to secure and protect that cash yourself.    It is not as convenient as a WellsFargo credit card.  You can say: "Well - you don't have to worry about securing the cash if you just deposit it in a bank. Then your cash is safe and convenient."
True - but you lose all the *benefits* of the emergency cash if it's in a bank.
The same with Bitcoin.  Yes. Coinbase may one day be as-convenient as WellsFargo. But that's not Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be slightly more cumbersome - because you are responsible.
Bitcoin gives you digital Freedom - but you have to protect it yourself.

"At least banks re-imburse any lost funds." Sounds like the perspective of someone who has the privilege of trusting their banks.  Most of the world is not like you. 
Bitcoin is not meant to be used by the masses.  Bitcoin isn't meant for goofy Aunt Sally to buy cupcakes. It is meant to be used by people who *need* it.   Big difference.  Average Joes don't need Bitcoin.   The point of bitcoin is censorship resistance. It's for people with oppressive governments. 
The point of Bitcoin is not "to save 5 cents in credit card fees". That's a meme that works on average Joes.
The point of Bitcoin is in preparation of global negative interest rates. The point of Bitcoin is to avoid the 25% haircut Greece inacted on all bank deposits so they could bail-out their own shitty government.  Bitcoin is for Venezuelans. Bitcoin is for people resisting the Chinese Orwellian surveillance state.

There's less of a "technical reasoning" and more an element of behavioral economics. 
There are other ways to ensure that a currency doesn't inflate forever. Satoshi picked a method that created **urgency.**  The hardest part of inventing cryptocurrency isn't writing code.  
The difficult part of cryptocurrency is "boostrapping it".  
Bitcoin was boostrapped on a meme/elusion than 1 bitcoin was &gt;$0.000000001.  Once enough people said "fuck it" maybe I'll buy some just in case", then that delusion became reality, then it became a feedback loop.

However, I think the preacher is trying to "dumb down" his message to resonate with the audience, and makes 1 critical error:
"Never ascribe malice to actions that can be explained by incompetence."
I think where the preacher makes the mistake is describing the global conspiracy in terms of a "calculated, malicous, illuminati scheme", rather than the reality: Central Bankers who just blindly tinker with shit and fuck it up over and over and over, can't admit their mistakes or biases, and cave to pressure to "prop things up" no matter what.

It sounds like you don't really understand the FED.
This isn't a conspiracy theory - it's literally how the Fed works.
The Fed uses 3 main tools to set interest rates: OMO (Open Market Operations aka Quantitative Easing), setting the reserve rate, and setting reserve requirements.
**All 3 of these tools are equivalent to "printing money",** just in slightly different ways.
The most egregious of these (in terms of "printing money) is probably OMO:
The Fed uses OMO to set interest rates by purchasing government/debt securities (10-yr Treasuries) in the open market.  To affect interest rates, they need to buy billions of treasuries per year.
Where does the Fed get this money?  They simply add it to their own account. Out of thin air.  Then they use it to purchase 10-year treasuries from the open market.
Of course it's a bit more nuanced than that (since they're adding the new money directly into the reserve accounts of their member-banks). But otherwise, the above description is a 100% valid, written in legislation, public information, not-a-conspiracy-theory description of the FED.
So asking "how much money did the FED print today" is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it's entirely valid.
One last note on the "the Fed's 3 tools are equivalent to printing money":
The difference in these tools, is that it's not a *permanent* increase in money  akin to printing $100 dollar bills - **all 3 of the Fed's tools need to be unwound at some point in the future**.  That's what causes "debt cycles" or "business cycles".  The Fed prints money - and we hope that we can "unwind" this printing during a bull-market's prosperity.  We unwind the tools, then we're ready to combat the next recession.  What's occurring now, is that we're 11 years into a bull market, and we have done ZERO unwinding over the past 11 years (in short terms, by slowing raising interest rates as the bull-market charges upwards).
That's the horrifying problem.  On average, the Fed has dropped interest rates by 4-6% during any recession. At no point in history have interest rates been this low during a mature bull-market.
What happens when the next recession hits and the "tools" haven't been unwound yet?  Negative interest rates at approximately -4%.
Enter Bitcoin.
That's why understanding the Fed is a gateway drug to Bitcoin.

You're making a logical point - but it's something already baked into my post above. 
You've accurately described the issue:  The Fed can be summarized by 2 directives - 1) print money to ensure stable constant growth 2) do this until inflation occurs. 
TL;DR: Inflation is going gangbusters right now, but NOT in consumer goods - which is how inflation is calculated by the FED. Inflation is occuring in real estate, equities, and debt securities, since financial institutions are the ones receiving this "newly printed money".  Purchases of stock by corporations : all-time high. Equity multiples: all-time high. Real state asset prices in "investment grade" ("gateway") cities: all-time high. 
You're correct - inflation is not occurring.  Why?  Inflation is calculated based on a baskets of CONSUMER goods.  Here's why that's different during this bull market:
Basing inflation on a basket of consumer goods made sense when the Fed was originally chartered:  A network of 20,000 regional and local banks, fat with new cheap money from the Fed, were incentivized to make loans to local businesses owners. Regional businesses expanded, drove the middle class, and increased wages for nation's average worker.  Inflation occured in-tandem with cheap money, as consumer wages increased. 
What has happened over the past 30 years? The death of small businesses in favor of national conglomerates. 
Now: The 5 national banks, fat with new cheap money, are incentivized to make loans.  Increasingly, this cheap money is going to the most-competitive players in each industry.  These conglomerates are amazing at 1) economies of scale (competition), and 2) paying workers less and less. 
The 11 year bull run has done FUCK ALL for the consumer.  
I'm not writing a Bernie Sanders sob story here - I'm a corporate banker myself. I don't give a shit about the consumer - I'm just stating the facts. 
National wages are stagnant.  Corporate profits are at all time highs.
These financial institutions and corporations are exploding at the seams with cheap cash. They're literally falling over themselves trying to find any fucking asset they can invest in. Apple is parking $246 billion in cash overseas right now.  Did that mean that Genius Bar employees are getting paid any more? Fuck no they're not. 
The Stock market is an earnings/price multiples which surpass the 2000's tech bubble.  People are throwing their money into every fucking risky asset in the world right now because they have so much god damn cash. 
A great term for this... might be... "inflation". Occurring in the stock market. Huh.
The cheap money is being used to 1) buy-back stock (which in 2019 hit record levels), 2) buy financial assets (stock market going literally ballistic for the past 5 years), 3) purchase hard assets (real estate going vertical the past 5 years).
Luckily... none of the above 3 items are included in the Fed's calculation of inflation. 
So yes - the Fed has been printing money for 11 years. Inflation has been occurring. The Fed is blissfully OK with a flawed measure of inflation.

Negative interest rates turn money into a liability rather than an asset.
"servicing, credit card, and overdraft fees" are a completely different topic which are microscopic compared to negative interest rates. Imagine that you put your money in a bank today. It has an annual interest rate of 1% per year. You leave 100,000 in the bank. 1 yr later you have 101,000.
Negative interest rates of 1%: you leave $100,000 in the bank. 1yr later you have 99,000. This wasn't a "fee" that the bank charged you. It's that your money just evaporated to the FED.
The FED has made dollars a toxic asset. Suddenly noone wants to hold USD. But: literally EVERY BANK has negative interest rates. There's no "better competitor". 
This is why under negative interest rates the BANKS no longer want to hold US dollars. The dollars are toxic. They'll do anything in their  power to lend it out - even if that means paying consumers to take out loans.




Every business cycle is driven by debt. When debt stops resulting in additional productivity to justify the loan, then a recession happens. Negative interest rates prevent a recession by offering even more "free-er" debt to everyone.
Aka: the heroin analogy. You're staving off your hangover by shooting-up more heroin.

The "email" option is not actually sending your bitcoin via email. 
Think of the Bitcoins you just bought from coinbase as a "Bitcoin IOU - redeemable at [Coinbase.com]( 
When you "send via email" you are simply notifying someone via email that they now own your "Coinbase IOU".
At no point has this IOU been redeemed from Coinbase for your actual bitcoins. 
The only way you "claim the IOU" is by withdrawing your bitcoins from Coinbase into a *"wallet you control".*  A hardware variant of this is Ledger, or Trezor, but **you really need to understand how Bitcoin works before you attempt to use one of these**. 
With this in mind - keep you coins on Coinbase while you start researching how Bitcoin actually works.

The other problem is that this monetary policy distorts the Fed's view on inflation.
The FED has a target on inflation - they will keep "pumping" free money until inflation starts passing 3%.  But.. somehow, inflation hasn't occurred yet. 
Reason: "inflation" is based on a basket of consumer goods. Which... here's the key... doesn't include the prices of real estate or stocks. 
Where has all the inflation occurred in the past 5 years?  Record-high stock market multiples and real estate values. Huh. I wonder why Americans can't afford houses any more. 
None of the money being pumped is going to the consumer - it's going to depository institutions (through either QE or lower reserve ratios)... This causes extremely cheap money for institutions, who are currently pouring money into the stock and real estate market. 
Oh - imagine that - real estate and stock-prices don't show up on the Fed's inflation statistics. 
Fed's gonna keep the foot on the gas until they see inflation. 
Rinse and repeat. Rates go lower and lower, then negative, then more negative. 
 
That's when bank deposits suddently become toxic to hold. 
THAT's when shit hits the fan. 
When people suddenly realize that holding bank deposits is literally bleeding them dry. 
Wait until we see negative returns on real estate investments.   That's going to be wild.
It's not going to be a "run on the bank"... it's going to be a run trying to trade your "bank deposits" into any other asset.
Suddenly - physical cash out-competes bank deposits.  People attempt to get physical cash. If they can do it in large enough amounts, then the government loses their power to control the multiplicative effects of monetary policy through reserve ratios. 
This is the reason why the IMF published a blog: "how to make negative interest rates work".  The first rule: "To make negative interest rates work - you must first eliminate physical cash".  Physical cash is the 1 thing preventing negative interest rates - since it allows you to withdraw your USD from the negative-interest bank.  If you don't have physical cash... then you've got no alternative other than keeping your "money" in the bank.  If/When physical cash is eliminated - you're finally plugged into the banking system with no way of exiting. 
Hmm. A "fight against cash". Sounds oddly familiar to the trend currently seen around the globe. 
Oh - what's cryptocurrency?

Yeah - a lot of libertarians/bitcoiners/gold-bugs "know that the Fed prints money", but they really have no clue how it works.  They just enjoy reciting it in debates, and usually look like an idiot when they conflate the wrong things. 
That's why their arguments usually sound like "The FED prints literally trillions of dollars - look at our national debt - it's $20 Trillion". 
The unfortunate result: Any time you even mention the FED "printing money", people's gut reaction is that you're an idiot. Then the people who actually understand the FED are lumped-into the "uninformed conspiracy theorist" category.

Read this whole thing if you want to understand. 
Source: I am a corporate banker in NYC.
The FED is tasked with stabilizing the economy and hitting a target 2-3% inflation rate.
They accomplish this in 2 ways:
1. Dictating the federal reserve "Deposit rate"
2. Quantitative Easing.
\ is what primarily drives the negative interest rates: Here's a 1-page generalized crash-course on this;
How does this work:
To BE a bank, you need to follow the Fed's rules.  This is what is knows as being "FDIC" insured.  This means that if the bank has to obey certain rules about how risky their loans can be, how much of reserves they need to hold, etc. The trade-off, is that they then are able to be a federally regulated bank and get FDIC coverage on their deposits. FDIC insurance literally was created to prevent losses due to bank robberies, runs on the bank, etc.  AKA banks used to hold US dollars inside of a local vault.  When a bank robbery occurred - people who stored their money in the bank literally lost their money.  IF the bank make too many shitty loans, a run on the bank occurred and people who used \[First West Bank of Lower Mississippi, etc\] saw their life savings drop to $0 because they accidentally picked a shitty bank.
To combat this, congress created the concept of FDIC insurance.  As long as you comply with our regulations - banks actually DON'T need to store USD in their vaults. Banks suddenly became immune to losses due to bank robberies, and if a run-on the bank occurred, the Fed would step-in to make-whole any deposits.   "Just obey our rules, and we'll issue you Federal Reserve notes" - which is a monetary instrument that's as-good-as a crisp $100 bill.  Since, if all banks in the country use them - then they're basically money.
Banks obviously take money from depositors and lend it back out again.  HOWEVER, banks need a certain amount of working-capital to satisfy daily operations needs, and a place to store their "reserves" for each loan they make.   Banks then have "accounts" at the Federal reserve.  **Think of the Federal Reserve as a BANK FOR BANKS.** Their deposits are denominated as Federal Reserve deposit balances. Now, to be a bank you must have an account at the Federal Reserve where you hold US dollars. The Federal Reserve then credit's the banks account with a federal reserve note.
Now, we have all banks in the US operating on Federal Reserve notes.  If Chase bank wants to send Wells Fargo $100B, they make the request to "settle" this at the Federal Reserve.  This is essentially how banks wire money to eachother.  They don't cart a wagon of US bills - they say: hey, we both have accounts at the Federal Reserve, lets just get the Fed to update our ledgers.
After all, a Federal Reserve note might not BE a $100 bill, but it's a type of money that all banks in the country NEED, so it's basically money. Its a guarantee from congress to be worth $1.  So a Federal Reserve note is essentially the exact same thing as a US dollar.  It's a promise from the government to be worth $1 as long as you're a FDIC insured bank.
The Federal reserve holds this cash for the banks. Honestly the banks kinda hate this to be honest, it's a necessary pain to get the FDIC insurance - since they'd rater use this cash to generate a return.   The Federal reserve gives them a "fair-market" return on their cash in the form of a Deposit Rate - call it 5.50% (this is crazy high in today's standards, but is within the *historical* norm).  Now - the banks have a certain "return" they can get on their deposits.  **This sets the interest rate floor of the economy.**  Now, it's the start of the year, and a bank considers making a loan to a bakery  - the bank first ask themselves "how much return could I get on this $10,000,000 if I just deposited-it into my Federal Reserve account?"  The federal reserve deposit rate would give me 5.50% return per year.  Now the bank says I have a risk-free return of 5.50%.  This bakery seems a bit risky, so **I'm going to charge a premium over my cost of cash (the risk-free federal reserve deposit rate).**  The bank ads  a "spread" of 3.0%.  Now the bank makes a loan for an 8.50% interest rate to the bakery.
This is how the Fed controls interest rates - by setting the deposit rate.  Banks are forced to use the Fed's interest rate - because they're forced to have an account at the FED to be a recognized bank, get approval from regulators to make loans, etc. etc.
Now.  A recession happens. The economy stalls. Banks are scared, and so they stop making loans.  They park their money in their Federal Reserve accounts to wait-out the recession.  They're getting a 5.0% return on these deposits.
This is BAD for the economy - especially for a politician or a Federal Reserve banker who is tasked with "stabilizing the economy".  (and especially bad for politicians who are in office during an election).
To spur lending - the Federal Reserve bank then decrees:  We are lowering our depository rate from 5.50% to 2.0%.  Now, banks are fuckin pissed, since they're basically making no money in their Fed accounts any more.  They then turn to the markets and say "fine - we'll now make loans MUCH easier to get, since we're basically getting nothing for all our cash in the Fed.   This encourages banks to make loans, since the money they're sitting on isn't doing much if it's not being lent.  The problem is: this also incentivizes making riskier and riskier loans to less-and-less qualified borrowers. Also: it helps foundering-bloating shitty companies who had an 8.0% loan to refinance down to a 3.5% loan, and stave-off their bankruptcy.
Debt is a tool of natural selection - if you can't pay your loan because your product is shitty - you go bankrupt.  What lowering interest-rates does is: 1) spur lending 2) let bloated shitty companies stay afloat using the artificially-cheap money as they refinance.
Now - negative interest rates is the same thing - just on crack.  The Fed sets the interest rate to -2.0%.
The Federal reserve is telling banks YOU BETTER FUCKING LEND MONEY OR ELSE.  The Bank is like holy fuck - if we keep money in our account, it's literally burning a hole in our pockets.  The bank starts doing everything they can to lend more and more money. The ONLY alternative to this, is for the bank to literally start cashing-in their Fed notes for US dollars (hard, physical US dollar bills).  If they don't want to pay this -2.0% fee, they'd need to go back to the days of settling bank-to-bank wires with literal wagon-fulls of cash. Banks obviously don't do this, so they're locked into paying the -2.0% fee on any Federal Reserve notes they sit-on.
What does this cause?
Cheaper than free money - for everyone.  Want a loan? you got it.  Want to buy a house with 90% LTV?  BOOM - done.  Here's a mortgage at 1.0% interest for 30 years (hell, it's better than losing -2.0%, which is the bank's alternative).
It's crack cocaine to prop up a market.   AND LITERALLY EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS DOING THIS.  They're in a race to the bottom.  They're doing it because 1) politicians are shortsighted and will gladly sell the future to prop-up the economy *during their term* (see: Trump, harassing the Fed over Twitter in recent months to keep rates low-as-possible).
The Federal reserve is asleep at the wheel since their only task is 1) stabilize the economy no matter what, and 2) do this until inflation starts to occur, then ease off the gas-pedal.  Inflation is calculated based on a basket of *CONSUMER* goods.  None of this cheap money is going directly to the consumer. Consumers are hardly benefitting from the recent bull-market in the economy.  The Fed's inflation calculation does not account for rising prices of Stocks, Equities, REAL ESTATE.  What has sky-rocketed in value overthe past 10-years of low interest rates?  Real Estate, stocks, equities.  Fed keeps lowering the rate since "InflLaTion IsnT OcCurinG".
Repeat until another, bigger, great recession.
That's what's going on.

Just like having $1,000 in cash under your bed provides security in-case of a natural disaster; the trade off is that you need to protect your $1,000 in cash by purchasing a safe for your home.

Even though what this guy says is on-the-right track... (I'm a little uncertain about his historical accounts).
That's not the point though - You need to go further to understand where we are **now.**
You have to appreciate that the **current** system has only been around for \~ 10 years. Quantitative Easing and "better-than-Free" money is a radical departure from the already less-than-perfect system that has been in place for the past 60 years.
Why hasn't this system collapsed yet?
1. Freedom of information has only existed for \~20 years. In the past 10 years, magnitudes of people have already started to realize the absolute dominance of the Fed's role in our lives. Trump can fire USA Nukes ^((tm))- so that makes him the most-powerful man in the world.  At  Fed Chairman Powell controls the global economy.  **In the past 10-years Federal Reserve Banks have** ***become*** **the stock market.**
**Powell single-handedly decides the interest rate on debt for the entire global economy.** Think about that.  Powell, tomorrow, can decide to raise interest rates by 2.0%, and send the financial markets into the biggest crash in history. Powell won't do it in the same way (we  hope) trump won't fire nukes. But that doesn't mean he couldn't do this. 
This isn't unique to the US.  EVERY COUNTRY has a Federal Reserve Bank which, for the past 10 years, have all gone off-the-wagon in exceedingly risky experiments on their own economies. Negative European interest rates are a symptom of the world's Federal Reserve Banks racing to the bottom as fast as economically possible.
**Think I'm exaggerating?  Here's a concrete example I guarantee you didn't realize:**








Didn't realize that? Yeah - for some reason, most people don't.  I've worked in corporate banking for years and never realized this.  The reason why no one knows this isn't because  "there's a conspiracy to prevent the masses from figuring this out" ... It's literally all published information. It's just that no one really cares to dive that deep into it. And once they do - they just go "oh that's a weird system, but I guess it's worked for 60 years". or they say "Hmmm. That can't be the way it *actually* works. That doesn't seem right, maybe I don't understand it correctly".
Reason  why the charade hasn't ended yet: Post-war boom combined with America's absolute domination of the world economy for the past 60 years finally coming to an end.
The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Even if that means 60 years. Fraud is only exposed when hard-times hit, or when an audit occurs.  Luckily, the Fed has not been subject to either of those catalysts yet.

Agreed - but it is what it is.
It the government could employ KYC on cash, they absofuckinglutely would.
The only reason Cash is anonymous is because applying KYC to cash is impossible.  \*That's why the govt is trying to kill cash.\*
The government doesn't have to apply KYC to every purchase of coffee with your credit card, because the accounts holding the cash are already KYC'd.
The government realizes that it can realistically apply KYC requirements to crypto (only at the point at which it touches a fiat-to-crypto gateway )- and they sure as hell will keep trying until every Fiat-to-crypto gateway is completely locked down.
And yes - funding terrorism is a cop-out, but generalizations like that are what get draconian pieces of legislation into law.

edit: I just re-read your comment, my answer might be describing something else, but I already typed it so I'm leaving it.
This is probably a method that your wallet is using to reduce the amount of transaction fees you pay in the future. 
You're 'not supposed to reuse old addresses' because it degrades the cryptographic integrity of the address e.g. it would be 40% easier to brute-force if you have 2 instances of an address being used, etc. [I made that % up].  **However,** that weakness only appears if you use the address to *send* bitcoins, you can receive bitcoins as many times as you want to the same address with no negative security effect.  
But why the wallet is reusing old addresses:
Bitcoin transactions are larger in byte-size if there's more addresses being used. Larger size = higher miner fee required to incentivize a miner to build it into a block.
So your wallet likely pulled an address that had never been used for sending coins, and decided to lump your new change in that address. The other option would be to create a new address for your change. The problem with this though, is that now you have bitcoins on [x]+1 addresses addresses instead of [x].  So if you ever want to move all your bitcoins, you'd need to identify all [x]+1 addresses that you own, which makes the transaction-size larger and more expensive from a fee perspective.

The SEC absolutely has put it in those terms. Read their rejection letters, and the requirements for approvals.
RE: gold and wheat - In the current state of the futures and ETF markets, no one *anonymous* participant can manipulate those markets, due in part to their size, liquidity, and maturity.
You could say that a nation-state could influence those markets, but to pull it off on the scale required, whatever entity was flooding the non-registered spot market with buy orders would quickly lose anonymity, or would easily be identifiable to SEC investigators.
Flooding any one of the 1,000s of Bitcoin markets with buy orders is easy to pull off and still remain anonymous. 
The SEC is waiting until KYC infiltrates a majority of exchanges before an SEC will be approved.  This pressure is going to keep pushing and pushing on exchanges until we start seeing demarcations between "coloring" bitcoins as "KYC-approved bitcoins" and "yet-to-be identified bitcoins".  That's why we need privacy and fungibility features implemented into the Bitcoin protocol before we get too far into the regulatory mire.  OR, conversely, remain stagnant on privacy features, with increasing KYC protocols added to the Bitcoin infrastructure to get bitcoin approved, then afterwards ... add the anonymity features after-the-fact in a bait-and-switch.
**Corporate buy-in of bitcoin is mutually exclusive with anonymous censorship resistance Bitcoin**
By design, Bitcoin is a "peer-to-peer" currency.  a "Peer-to-Corporation" currency is a whole different proposition.  At the end of the day, no corporation is allowed to touch an anonymous currency.  Any corporations that currently do, are probably on a limited timeline for doing so.  The regulatory bodies simply haven't kept up yet.  Trust me, they will start cracking down on corporations which continue to touch non-KYC'd bitcoins.
In a sentence: An anonymous currency, in the eyes of regulators, is synonymous with "terrorist dollars". No corporation is allowed to touch terrorist dollars.

I agree with you, but it's important to keep in mind: This card is fundamentally \*not\* Bitcoin.  Which many consumers won't grasp.
They see this card and say "what's the point of bitcoin"? It's just like my credit card?
They fail to grasp that Coinbase is a small start-up \*\*bank\*\* which is riding Bitcoins coattails. Really nothing more than this. Coinbase isn't anything special, and it offers none of Bitcoin's strengths. It's simply a start-up Bank.
When you buy Bitcoins at Coinbase, you're not buying Bitcoins.  You're buying Coinbase IOUs.  This card simply uses Coinbase IOUs to pay Visa.  At no point are Bitcoins ever in this equation.
The only connection Coinbase has with Bitcoin, is that you can exchange your Coinbase IOUs for real Bitcoin when you ask Coinbase for their permission to move them to a private wallet. At this point, Coinbase is forced to produce real Bitcoins into your private wallet.
It's amazing to me how many newbies can be interested in investing in crypto for 12+ months and still barely grasp the difference between Bitcoin and Not-Bitcoin.  The point of Bitcoin is the blockchain. This credit card has 0 to do with Bitcoin. I just hope that it doesn't dilute the true strengths and utility of Bitcoin to the masses.

Negative interest rates = selling the future for the present. 
If you think about it like that it's way easier to understand and predict.
Negative interest rates: Think of it as bloated government subsidy to the entire economy.  They're subsidizing the economy by making our currency worth less. Once you think of it like that, it's much less confusing. 
"The government is subsidizing the entire economy.  The amount of their subsidy is increasing ad-infinitum.  How will this end?" 
"Well - that might not cause WW3 - but that's definitely going to cause shit to get fucked up if we ever get addicted to the subsidy".

If you haven't already - I would start by reading the bitcoin White paper cover to cover. It's only ~10 pages? Read it until you understand it.
That's what I did when I first discovered Bitcoin.  I knew nothing about Cryptography, so I basically just understood 10% of the paper on my first pass. I re-read it over and over.
The first thing I didn't understand?  Google it. 
Don't understand what a "private key" is?  Google it, watch a youtube video. 
When you can read the Whitepaper and describe it to someone else, you will "fully understand" Bitcoin. 
Of course, the GOAL is that Bitcoin will be so easy to use one day, that you don't need to do all this research. But that day has not yet come.  Bitcoin lets you be your own bank, but that trade off comes with the *responsibility* of being your own bank.

His first step was hacking his phone.  He knew the phone number, so likely he called OP's phone company, and socially engineered them to issue a new SIM card.  The hacker then loaded the SIM card into a burner phone.
The hacker then goes to Gmail and requests that he's "locked out of his email".  Gmail sends a 2FactorAuthorization text to his phone number, but the hacker now has OP's phone number and texts.  The hacker can now approve the email password reset and has access to OP's Gmail.
That's why SMS 2FA is not ideal.  With Google 2FA app, the hacker would need to physically steal OP's phone to hack him.

Old adage: The road to prosperity is paved with the scalps of "market-timers".  
No one can predict the market.  Tomorrow, someone might drop a whitepaper that causes bitcoin's price to shoot up 30%.  Ethereum might collapse and have the same effect.  Bitcoin might drop 50%.
If you believe in it, buy now.  If you're scared of volatility, buy a little bit every week. If you're scared that Bitcoin is overpriced, it probably is, but people said the same thing at $0.44, $1.50, $200, $1350, etc.

It all depends on what "goods and services" are priced in, and how the USD and Bitcoin relate to those goods and how they relate to all other FIAT currencies.
For instance, for a bitcoin to go from being worth 1000 USD to 10 USD one of two things needs to happen:
* 1) Bitcoin "drops" in value.
* 2) the USD sky-rockets in value.
Either one of these things means exactly the same if Bitcoin and USD were the only currencies in the world.  However, to establish "wealth" you need to add in the 500 other fiat currencies to start getting an idea of which one is actually rising or falling, and think about what "goods" you're trying to buy.
**Scenario 1:** If the Bitcoin to (all other currency) exchange rates drops (as in the first option, then in your scenario, the bitcoin investor would absolutely be "less wealthy".  
It's tempting to say: "This bread cost 1 BTC before, and no matter what happens to USD, it is still 1 BTC. So I *should* be just as wealthy!"  While this is true, if Bitcoin plummeted in value, because of supply and demand people would start converting their USD to Bitcoin, and paying 100 BTC for bread, increasing the cost to you.
**Scenario2:** If the USD is strengthening versus all other currencies (second scenario), then it's possible that the Bitcoin investor could still be "as wealthy".  However, in this second scenario it's important to note: if a Bitcoiner was attempting to purchase goods denominated in USD, they *would* be "poorer" when attempting to purchase US goods, but would have the same purchasing power if they decided to buy Chinese goods, for instance.

This is what I was talking about. I'm glad that you're learning something new! But the way you described cracking the blockchain shows me that you still don't know, fundamentally, what Bitcoin is.
I would never look down on a newbie for not knowing something, but I do think it's sub-optimal and concerning to invest in it until you do.
Coinbase facilitates Bitcoin-investing to people with 1) very surface-level and flawed understanding of Bitcoin is and 2) no real intention of using actual Bitcoin.
If people were aware of their ignorance, that would be fine, but many people claim to understand Bitcoin, "invest" in it,  then you ask them how a Wallet works (on a high level) and they have no idea what a wallet is.
When those people lose their investments after Coinbase gets hacked, they will then have their opinion of Bitcoin tarnished... Unaware that they never actually owned Bitcoin. 
Coinbase IOUs are one of the worst investments imaginable - from the perspective that they can vanish instantly from a hack, and you have no recourse or remedy, and no clue if it was a Coinbase insider that did it.

It's not a problem with Bitcoin.
It's a symptom of how hard it is to get your money \*out of\* the banking system.
Go into your bank today and ask for $15,000 is cash.  When they refuse, that's the first realization that the money in your checking account isn't yours. It's the banks.  The only dollars you own are the dollars in your pocket.
Yes it's hard to exit the banking system.  That's what gives us the urgency to get assets into Bitcoin before the fist closes even tighter.  There's a certain point where Bitcoin hits a critical mass, and the main way of obtaining Bitcoin WONT be buy purchasing it with Bank-owned dollars, but will be obtained through earning it with Goods and Services.
It's hard to buy Bitcoin.  It will be harder in the future, not easier.  The gamble is: "will Bitcoin be self-sustaining before the banks completely ban transacting with exchanges?
That's the cost-benefit analysis of investing in Bitcoin. Anyone who tells you that Bitcoin will get easier to buy with bank-dollars is deluded. Banks can blacklist any vendor they want.  They do it daily.  That's the point though. Get in while you can.  Bitcoin will get easier to use, but not to buy.  I guarantee you, if bitcoin ever hits $100,000/btc, banks will cut off deposits to exchanges and start openly fighting and lobbying against it.  The government will ban it outright.
If we have decentralized exchanges by then, that's when nothing can stop Bitcoin.

Death by 1,000 paper cuts.
First, 100 merchants will accept Bitpay and convert it behind the scenes into Fiat, and out of those, 1 merchant won't convert it to fiat.  
Then 10,000 merchants will accept Bitpay and convert to fiat, out of those, 10 will accept Bitcoin and won't convert it to fiat.  
Slowly, public perception notices that Bitcoin can be spent at 10,000 merchants.  The consumers won't mind that only 1/100 of the merchants "hold it".   Suddenly, I think of Bitcoin as a payment method.  I decide to accept it at my store too as a novelty.  I don't even consider converting it to Fiat considering .  It only comprises 0.5% of my transactions. 
Suddenly people forget about converting it back into FIAT between each iteration - it's cheaper to just send bitcoin around.

The "huge force" you're describing is the current Bitcoin inflation rate.  The current "downward' pressure on Bitcoin is 3.86% per year.
So, not as "huge" as it initially seems.
Put another way: Do you think that the amount of people who decide to purchase bitcoin will grow more than 3.8% per year? If so, then the price will increase exponentially.
Furthermore, in 559 days and 17 hours, the inflation rate drops to 1.80%.
"Do you think the amount of people who decide to purchase some bitcoin will increase by more than 1.8% pe year?  If so, then the price will increase exponentially."

I'm sure you already know the nuance, but for other readers trying to follow along:
Bitcoin Core is actually not a malicious name in itself.  It's simply a name that a team of developers who work on Bitcoin call themselves.  The Bitcoin Core team. They develop one of the main clients for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin Core is an *actual* group of people - who developed a client for Bitcoin. You can have multiple clients for bitcoin without changing the source code of Bitcoin.  I could develop a client on my own and called "Bitcoin Excelsior" if I wanted to - and it would still operate on the Bitcoin network, moving *actual* bitcoins.
Roger Ver turned "Bitcoin Core" into a smear campaign when he tried to conflate the Bitcoin network (that we know and love) with Bitcoin Core. Saying that the Bitcoin Core team had hijacked the Bitcoin network.
If a specific group of people tried to call themselves the "Official Bitcoin team", then I think you would agree that would be even worse.

You can't have both. The code has changed over the years and will continue changing if the community accepts the changes.
That said. To go back to the original question. The  open pool of developers who contribute to the bitcoin "codebase" all decided to upgrade Bitcoin. The only important part is: When they did this upgrade all the bitcoin users in the world agreed to it.  (Well, x% didnt, and they *also* changed the codebase in a different way and created BCH).

Blur that line until Bitcoin just steps in without Bitpay.

The CEO of Nasdaq loves regulations.
The more regulations, the more entrenched they are as one of the few "approved" platforms to trade stocks.
Hilarious enough: If everything becomes tokenized, it also reduces their liability, as the stocks would suddenly shift from a Registered security to a Bearer-security.  This hasn't been the case for stocks for a VERY long time.
Registered security = the "owner" of the stock is whomever owner's name is registered on the Nasdaq servers as being the owner.
Bearer security = whoever holds a piece of paper is the owner of the security.
Back in the day, a stock was a physical piece of paper.  If you brought that paper to the stock market, you could sell it.  Even if you just found the stock on the sidewalk.
That's what tokenization would bring back: whoever holds the token is the owner. Kinda old-school. Love it.

a lot of people are betting that bitcoin will keep dropping.
the funny thing, is that by "betting" they're actually pushing the price of bitcoin down unintentionally. 
If the price of bitcoin starts to rise at all, then all the people who bet that bitcoin would keep dropping will break lose their bets, and their bets will be unwound. This causes the price to unintentionally rise.  As the price rises, more gamblers "lose" their bets, and unwind them.  This causes the price to rise again.
This is known as a "short sqeeze".  People who bet against bitcoin "the shorters" get squeezed out of the market.

Its not a bailout in the fact that we're already over-penalizing them by increasing the difficultly constantly to offset new mining power hitting the system.
If you want to use "tax" language here: We tax miners at a 99.9% tax rate (by increasing the mining difficulty). When they make more money than they're supposed to, we raise the tax rate. When miners leave the system, the artificially high difficulty is too much for the remaining miners to bear. The miners would start being "taxed" too much, at an effective tax rate of over 100%, So we *fairly and uniformly* lower the tax rate  back to 99.9%. (Recall, the 2009 bailout unfairly benefitted some entities over others).

People suddenly think that WEX is fishy.  People with assets on WEX are suddenly spooked. How do you get your fiat, tether, etc off of WEX?  Sell all your altcoins, buy Bitcoin, withdraw them from WEX.
This is artificially pushing the price of Bitcoin up because people are paying a premium just to make-sure that they get their assets off the exchange. Withdrawals are on-chain transactions, so it affects the mempool.
TLDR; people are spooked on WEX.  They buy Bitcoin so they can withdraw it from WEX. Bitcoin price goes up on WEX.

It sounds like you just can't afford the better apartment - Bitcoin has nothing to do with it.
Selling assets to pay expenses is not sustainable. In general, you should only pay for expenses with reoccurring income.
If you work a 'wage-job', then this is a clear decision. Don't move.
HOWEVER, if your efforts at work are rewarded with a end-of-the-year bonus, then you have to run through the following thought-process:
"If I sold "X" Bitcoin to pay for rent, but could work 2 hours more **per day**, would that likely result in my bonus being X+$1 higher?"
If the answer to that question is YES, then you should sell your bitcoin and invest an extra 2 hours per day in your job.

One clarification on this. Stocks increase in value based on the *expectation* of future earnings. So even if they don't issue dividends, the *ability* to pay dividends in the future is the underlying principle behind a stock's price.
Just like Amazon did not turn a profit for over 10 years - the expectation of profits is what set the price.  Every company needs to eventually post a profit.  Oddly, with stocks, issuing a dividend can be pushed-out indefinitely (at-least until growth opportunities cease and the company reaches total market saturation). This doesn't change the fact that the stock's price is based on the future expectation of a large dividend.
Berkshire doesn't issue dividends, but its value goes up because Berkshire holds companies which *could* issue dividends if they wished.

Continuing this:
In essence, we should expect a Bitcoin sub to be extremely critical of any variations of Bitcoin besides the main one. These are our direct competitors. 
Conversely, when you ask a Bitcoiner about *true* alt-coins (Sia, Augur, Golem, etc) which are not direct competitors to bitcoin, you'll find that they're much more open to these.  This is a natural and expected reaction.  None of these alt-coins are attempting to steal users, co-opt brand recognition, and mislead investors.
If Bitcoin Diamond was *really* a better technology - why not call it "Diabit", or literally anything else?  It's because they want to ride the coat-tails of the bitcoin name.   Even if I wasn't a bitcoin holder, I'd be skeptical of something that needs to steal branding.

It's not strange. Bitcoin is simply code. However "THE Bitcoin" is a social construct.  Whichever one the people agree is Bitcoin becomes Bitcoin. Whatever this sub decides is Bitcoin, then that's what this sub decided.   Everything else becomes a scam. 


There's no altruism in cryptocurrency.  Once a coin begins directly competing against another, it absolutely turns into survival of the fittest.  Having 1 global cryptocurrency only works if there are a handful of coins that survive.  
Imagine in 5 years if there's 10,000 coins, and none of them have more than 0.5% market share.  Have we really accomplished anything for frictionless global trade? 
Competition, survival of the fittest, and "winner takes all" is a good thing.  If this experiment is going to work, we can't have 300 variations of Bitcoin all with similar market-share.  We need 1 or 2 giants, with 10,000 pis-ant altcoins that no one really uses.  We're all fighting for our Bitcoin version to be the big one.  And you should fight for your altcoin to be the big one as well.

But when you say "stopped reading at _____"  as-if you just made a fucking brilliant point - it really reflects poorly and I don't even know where to start.

In short: it's volatile because it's a speculative investment with no historical presedent or reference point. It could go to $0 or $100,000 tomorrow and both would be completely justified. In the stock market, it's *a little* easier to come to an agreed price, because earnings are what drives price.  In bitcoin... the price drives the price. Bitcoin becomes more valuable the more that people use it - this is called "the network effect".  Much like how an email account is useless if you're the only one in the world with email. The more people that buy bitcoin, the more useful it becomes.  This is why you have these huge spikes in price sometimes.


We **do** have this - that's what the price you see in the exchange represents. Everyone in the world is implicitly agreeing that this price is appropriate. When the price changes, that's because someone changed their mind, thought that bitcoin was overvalued, and sold theirs.   This isn't the same as Samsung putting a $1,400 price on a TV.  That's a fixed price and won't fluctuate.  Bitcoin is being sold on a market, not a retail outlet.
Broadly speaking, this is how trade has been working since the beginning of time.  Gold does not have a fixed price, and it's been fluctuating in price for 10,000+ years.

No prob.  
My gift came with a bit of a catch it would seem. The fee that was attached the transaction was below the market rate at the moment (the app I use doesn't let me set my own fees),  so it attached a 4 cent fee. I probably should have attached a 9 cent fee.  So this causes the transaction to have a lower priority.  You can see that the estimated confirmation is ~6 blocks.  So within the hour it should execute.

Middle america is behind the times.  The cities that matter aren't though.
Its funny. Ties used to be a corporate and big business thing.  Wearing a tie meant "I work in such a high-caliber environment, that I have to wear ties to work".  
Now, working in NYC, the only people you see wearing ties are high caliber brokers with a $400 tie, and 50 year stodgy old fat lawyers wearing old brown ties who make so much money they don't give a fuck.  Everyone else has abandoned ties in the workplace.
Now, oddly enough, you're starting to see back-office compliance officers and accountants in middle-america start to wear ties because they think it makes them look more corporate, "like the people wear in big corporations".  
They don't realize that they're wearing fat old ties their dad gave them in 1998 don't really fly any more. 
Funny how wearing ties daily now implies mostly a negative connotation these days.  Bank tellers.  They also wear ties.

The castle city of Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, has moved into the digital currency age with the launch of a project to use bitcoin to lure international travelers and preserve the city’s historic attractions, an apparent first by a Japanese municipality using a cryptocurrency.
The main purpose of the plan, which is seeking donations via the blockchain technology to help take care of about 2,600 cherry trees and the stone wall of Hirosaki Castle, is actually to promote the city by creating an easy donation platform that will hopefully incentivise those who make contributions to visit the city, said Kenji Suzuki, a Hirosaki city official.
“If people in other countries make donation through bitcoin in a casual manner, it’s possible that they will start forming attachments to Hirosaki and maybe think about visiting one day,” he said.
While cross-border money transfers through banks take time and can be expensive, sending bitcoin from overseas is easy, quick and almost free of charge. Thus, bitcoin is an easy way to collect donations from people in other countries.
He added that the city is not in desperate need for cash, so the project is mainly a tourism promotion using a new technology.
According to Suzuki, it costs about several tens of millions of yen to maintain the cherry trees and about ¥200 million to take care of the stone wall annually. The city started repairing the castle wall several years ago because of the risk of collapse if a huge earthquake hit.
The city decided to use donations to take care of the cherry trees and the wall, both of which are located inside Hirosaki Park and are the most popular tourist attractions there.
Hirosaki started accepting cryptocurrency donations beginning April 20 after partnering with Coincheck, a Tokyo-based startup that runs a bitcoin exchange.
As of around 3 p.m. Tuesday, the city recorded 1.0755 worth of bitcoin (about ¥178,000) that was donated by 96 people.
The Hirosaki official said the city has neither set a goal for the amount of bitcoin it wants to collect nor decided how long it will run the donation drive.

Not the same.  The bank still has control to the cash.   At worst, this would just result in the bank needing to request more physical bills from the treasury.
Likely it would just result in a "Yes, we're happy to oblige your request, however, we need a 2-3 month processing timeline before we can procure the physical bills from the treasury. We will also charge you an administrative and storage fee of 0.3% of the total cash requested"

For five years, European nations have been trying to jump-start their ailing economies with what was supposed to be a [radical, short-term remedy—negative interest rates](
Instead, [central banks haven’t been able to wean their economies off them.]( Increasingly, they appear to be a permanent feature of the landscape. No major bank that introduced negative rates during Europe’s debt crisis has turned main policy rates positive again.
“Overall, we are on a painkiller,” said Tamaz Georgadze, chief executive of Raisin GmbH in Berlin, which provides a platform for consumers and businesses to deposit through 77 banks in 25 countries, “and it’s very hard to get off it.”
Negative rates reverse normal lending costs. Commercial banks must pay to keep their money in central banks, rather than collecting interest on it. That means they should have an incentive to lend their money at low cost to other banks, businesses and consumers while charging some customers to deposit cash. [In theory, that encourages people to borrow more, spend more and save less]( the economy until negative rates aren’t needed.
Negative ImpactCentral banks moved interest rates below zero to stimulate their economies...Central-bank ratesSources: the central banks (rates); Capital Economics (forecasts)Note: Forecasts start from May 2019%European CentralBankSwitzerlandSwedenDenmark2014’15’16’17’18’19’20’21-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.0
The negative-rate policy’s ineffectualness is a sign of just how weak Europe’s economic engines are, and how vulnerable. The policy threatens pensions, creates the risk of real-estate bubbles and doesn’t fully quell the specter of deflation. European banks struggle with weak interest income and thin margins on loans, putting them behind American peers in profitability and making it harder for them to finance the economy.
...but savings rates have barely budged...Net saving ratio of households and nonprofit institutions serving householdsSource: Organization for Economic Cooperation and DevelopmentNote: Forecasts start in 2019% of disposable incomeDenmarkGermanySwedenSwitzerlandU.S.2013’14’15’16’17’18’19’20-505101520Denmarkx2016x4.6% of disposable income
Public frustration is mounting in healthy countries such as Germany and Switzerland that don’t necessarily need negative rates, while those that do aren’t seeing much benefit. Profitless companies stay afloat, steering resources away from more efficient ones and weighing on productivity. Central banks’ inability to raise rates leaves them with little ammunition to cushion the next downturn with the conventional tool of interest-rate reductions.
 ...capital spending hasn't rebounded much...
Europe’s economic anxiety, along with other issues such as immigration, forms a backdrop to [European parliamentary elections this weekend where far-right parties are expected to make gains ]( the expense of centrist parties. The results are being closely watched for signs of disunity within Europe.
Negative rates haven’t had the desired effect on consumers such as Nick Altmueller, 42, who works in marketing in Berlin. “I’m not spending much more money and I’m not saving much more money,” he said. “I’m just moving it around.” He spreads his roughly €50,000 ($55,800) in savings between mobile banks based in Munich and Bulgaria, chasing a few tenths of a percentage point in extra yield. “This has become normality for me.”
The low rates are producing counterproductive responses: Some banks report major depositors have asked to park their physical cash in vaults—where it avoids incurring negative rates it might when in the form of electronic deposits but also does no good to the economy. Some Europeans, their pensions tied to bonds, are saving more to secure stable retirement income as bond yields drop.
 ...and the eurozone economy lags behind.
In Switzerland, some individuals are putting cash into real estate, prompting fears of overbuilding. “Holding cash,” said Swiss Bankers Association chief economist Martin Hess, “is simply more expensive than building an empty house.”
In one sign of how hard it has become to reverse rates, the European Central Bank, or ECB, which economists until recently had expected to raise rates toward zero this year, [has reversed course and unveiled fresh stimulus via cheap bank loans. It ]( examining ways, if needed, to offset any negative-rate damage on banks—]( indication it expects the rates to continue.

The point is: inflation is occurring, but not in consumer goods (since the money being printed is not being handed to the consumer).  Inflation is occurring in the prices of *assets*, since the money being printed is going to banks who need a place to invest their free money and are therefore driving returns on assets to the breaking point.
Historically - be a private saver - buy a share in a company, earn risk-adjusted returns.
Now: The prices of companies, and real estate is so high due to cheap capital, that returns are being pushed to 3-4%, even for riskier assets.
Want returns of 8-9%? You're in gambling territory now.  OR, you need to invest in start-ups.  The government already fucked that up too: they've restricted truly innovative investment opportunities to "accreddited investors only" (net worth requirements of over $1MM to participate). This of course is under the hand-holding guise of "protecting mainstream retail investors", when in reality, they're simply saying that only venture capital companies should have access to the truly disruptive investments of the decade.  
Retail investors get the leftovers for the companies after they go public. Have fun with your 3-5% returns. VC funds already skinned the sheep.

"A natural human right"
Can you please outline where these "natural human rights" are recorded?  Or is it just something you think sounds nice and fits into how you hope the world operates?
Not trying to be a dick, but just proving a point. "Freedom" isn't a universal principle that transcends space and time.  You're correct in the fact that the governments will always shrink our freedoms - the only thing stopping them is the threat of a rebellion, which you could argue is not a valid option anymore.
Human societies are changing. Nothing is sacred.
For 100,000 years humans could see the milky-way stretch across the sky on a dark night.  Scientists estimate that, due to light pollution, we're the last generation to enjoy that aspect of life.
Similarly, for 100,000 years, Humans had the ability to hide from the government when necessary, organize in privacy, and rebel against oppressive governments when needed.  It's increasingly difficult to do so, and eventually it will become impossible.
So, in the same way that our atmosphere is changing - we're also probably the last generation to enjoy true "Freedom".
The Surveillance State is already more powerful than we can ever hope to overcome. Google the "Social Credit system" in China, if you're unaware of the fact that "1984" is only 5-10 years away.   Sorry to break the news to you.

There's a few good resources I came across  when researching the best way to do a brain-wallet effectively.  (just quick google searches).
But essentially, just take the 12-word code, write it down on a sticky-note into 3 columns (and 4 rows).  Then just build a short 4-sentence story that utilizes your key words.
For instance:
"pillow smack tequila"
"The man used the **pillow** to **smack** the man who spilled his **tequila**."
"best apple latex"
"The man apologized by offering the **best apple** he owned, holding it with a **latex** glove"
Another minor tip, is that you want to make sure you recall only your key words, and not the supplemental words (like accidentally remembering "glove" rather than "latex".  So never write-down your full paragraph in sentence-form when practicing, only write down your key words as you recite.  Writing things down vastly helps with committing things to memory, so you want to make sure you're burning they key words into your memory.  Having never seen "glove" written down, you wont focus on it as much.

The ECB’s deposit rate will stay at minus 0.4% through 2021, projects Capital Economics, a consulting firm. It expects the Swiss to cut their rate to minus 1% next year from minus 0.75%. It expects Denmark, among the first to introduce negative rates in 2012, to lower its rate to minus 1% next year. By contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve pays American banks 2.35% interest on their excess reserves
Central bankers can’t give up negative rates in large part because it could damp their economies further. The European Commission said it expects the eurozone’s gross domestic product to advance 1.2% this year, down from the 1.9% it said it expected six months ago and half the U.S. rate. Germany’s recovery ground to a halt late last year and improved slightly last quarter.
Even with low rates, companies are watchful on spending. Patrick Jany, chief financial officer at Swiss chemicals giant [Clariant]( AG , said cheap money makes some investment projects appear attractive even if they aren’t. “For any company,” he said, “it’s very important not to succumb to the temptation of cheap money.”
Some central banks, such as the Swiss, exempt a certain amount of deposits from the negative interest rate, essentially creating a threshold beyond which banks pay a penalty they pass on to some big clients.
To avoid that, Mr. Jany said, his company has increased the number of banks it uses to spread deposits. When Clariant refinanced a bond recently, it received the new money a few days before it had to redeem the old bond. It negotiated with banks to deposit the money for a few days without charge.
 Cheap credit is of little use for people without jobs. Unemployment rates are in double digits in Italy, Spain and Greece and nearly 9% in France. The under-25 jobless rate is 16% in the eurozone, damaging finances for a key spending demographic.
Meanwhile, inflation has weakened across Europe well below the annual 2% growth rates central banks deem optimal. Low inflation can hurt an economy when falling prices lead consumers and businesses to delay spending because goods will get cheaper if they wait.
 Parked cash
[Here’s how negative rates work. ]( banks hold vast sums through deposits and other short-term holdings. They store some money—beyond what they need for operations or lend to other banks—with central banks. Normally, a central bank pays them interest on the deposits or holds them free of charge.
With negative rates, a central bank instead charges financial institutions to park cash. The banking institutions eat some of those costs and pass a portion along to large customers by charging them to deposit money. They also pass along benefits in the form of lower interest rates on borrowing.
Alternative Bank Schweiz AG, [a small Swiss bank]( in 2016 began charging customers for deposits—an interest rate of minus 0.125% for deposits up to 100,000 francs and minus 0.75% above that. Last year, it lowered those thresholds to 50,000 francs for checking accounts and 75,000 for savings. Larger banks have shielded individual depositors while charging negative rates to large clients such as pension and hedge funds.
“Banks and the economy are realizing that this is the new normal with negative interest rates,” said Alternative Bank CEO Martin Rohner, while bank clients “are increasingly becoming aware that this is a fact of life.”
Europe’s negative rates have had positive effects, such as lower exchange rates, which make a country’s goods and services relatively inexpensive and thus more attractive for other countries to buy.
That helps export economies such as Germany and Switzerland. The Swiss franc is still strong, but economists think it would have been stronger without subzero rates.
Another benefit: Negative rates—along with central-bank purchases of bonds to inject money into economies—depressed government bond yields through Europe, keeping Italy and other fragile euro members from crumbling under high debt loads while reducing borrowing costs for businesses.
The ECB estimates these policies will add about 2 percentage points to inflation-adjusted GDP in the eurozone from 2016 to 2020. ECB President Mario Draghi in March called negative rates “a powerful instrument in enhancing, fostering the recovery and converging to price stability and achieving our objective.”
Thanks in part to the ECB’s ultra-easy policies, Bernd Supe-Dienes, managing director at Dienes Group, a knife and cutting-systems company near Cologne, Germany, secured financing under 2% on a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage to build a factory for a subsidiary.
But negative rates have failed to do one big thing they were supposed to do: Spur spending durably and stimulate growth and inflation across Europe.
One reason is that big investors such as insurance companies and pension funds are limited in how much risk they can take with their money. They can’t borrow more at today’s rates and invest heavily in instruments such as infrastructure and loan products that would tend to spur capital spending, create jobs and help economic growth, without setting aside more money for regulatory requirements.
“You have almost this contradiction,” said George Quinn, CFO at[Zurich Insurance Group]( AG . He said regulators asked him several years ago: “What’s it take to get you guys to move away from your more traditional holdings of government bonds and buying more of the riskier assets?” The problem, he said, is that regulations either prevent it or make moving into riskier assets too expensive.
 Short-term jolt
Negative rates have also failed to accomplish the other big goal: Discourage saving. At Alternative Bank, despite negative interest rates, the number of depositors increased last year, and deposits rose 2% to 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.3 billion).
The rates gave a short-term jolt to automobile and apartment purchases, said its CEO, Mr. Rohner, but once that happened people tended to “go back to the steady state of their consumption.”
After seeing no change in his expected pension for years, Mr. Altmueller of Berlin started investing €75 a month in a private pension two years ago. “I’m starting to really think about investing in the stock market,” he said. “It looks like the only thing where you can get a little return.”
Big institutions and individuals are finding creative places to put their cash and avoid negative rates. Banks including [UBS Group]( AG received some requests, even recently, from big institutional and wealthy private clients to withdraw cash from their accounts and hold it in physical notes in their vaults as a way around negative interest rates. For very big amounts, this has generally not been possible, while for smaller amounts it has been done. Money kept in cash limits the effectiveness of negative rates.
The dilemma of negative rates was illustrated by [Swiss National Bank]( Thomas Jordan at the bank’s annual meeting in April, when he described two letters he received.
One was from a family business owner in northwestern Switzerland who folded after struggling with competition from countries with weaker currencies. For businesses like it, a devaluation of the Swiss franc caused by negative rates is a good thing—helping them compete with other countries.
Another letter complained that “minus interest” meant years of rising pension contributions. “You can’t have your cake and eat it,” Mr. Jordan said. “You can’t have higher interest rates and a weaker Swiss franc at the same time.”
Swiss commercial banks have paid over seven billion francs ($7 billion) to deposit money at the SNB since 2015, even though the SNB has exempted a large amount from negative rates. Eurozone banks pay about seven billion euros ($7.8 billion) annually to eurozone central banks.
That seems unlikely to change soon. “I am convinced that we will at some point return to positive interest rates,” Mr. Jordan said. “I cannot tell you now when exactly that will be.”

ASIC implies centralization.  It provides an insane amount of hashpower (protecting from 51% attached from governments, etc), but it also is a deal with the devil, because it accumulates hash power into 5-10 extremely well-capitalized miners.

Right, as I described elsewhere in the thread, Breadwallet gives me a 12-15 word long seed which was hashed to generate my BreadWallet private key.  The thief would need this 15-word password to steal my account. 
I have since memorized all 12-15 words of my seed and wiped my Breadwallet account, turning my Breadwallet into a brainwallet (i.e. can only be accessed with information stored in my brain, and I can access it anywhere in the world).
I have my 15 words written-down in a safe location as well, but nothing written on the paper would indicate that it's a breadwallet seed as the key words are obfuscated among other non-seed words.

I don't think my phone being stolen, for my case, will be a liability.
I use breadwallet and have memorized the randomly generated 12-15 word seed (I have a weekly calendar reminder to mentally recite my seed).  I've also cleared my wallet's private key from the app so my breadwallet app is blank. So it will function essentially as a brainwallet.
As a backup, I wrote my private-key's 15-word seed on a physical piece of paper stored in a safe location.
I think this gives me the most flexibility and security.

Bitcoin is a "bearer instrument".  Meaning that whoever holds the bitcoin private key is the owner. The only other asset like this is Cash.  Theft of physical cash happens all the time. 
Stocks are a "registered security".  Meaning, whoever's name is registered in a private database is the owner.  If someone hacks the database, and tries to change the owner... once it's figured-out, they can just edit the database to the correct owner after an investigation.  It's reversible.  Same with the Cash in your Etrade account.  It's just a databse entry on Etrade's computers.  IF somehow the hacker can supply fraudulent wiring information and get an etrade employee to send a bank wire to a somalian bank account... then yes, a hacker could steal money from etrade.  At this point, it's not a hack, it's a *Phishing* scam.  It happens to banks all the time.

Statistically, following this 1 simple statistical analysis, Bitcoin has miraculously always been a profitable investment had you followed these steps:
Step 1: Ignore the last 4 years in the analysis you're about to conduct.
Step 2: Who the fuck cares, we just ignored the past 4 years and are trying to extrapolate that data into the future.
Step 3: Rely on the fact that Bitcoin has been the best investment of human history over the past 10 years (ignoring the past 2 years).
What a theory.

Inflation is measured by a basket of *consumer* goods.
The money that's been "printed" has gone to the investment world, not the consumer.  With that in-mind, look at the USD prices of assets, stocks, equities, real estate over the past 10 years. Inflation has occurred, but only for people in the investment ecosystem who are literally tripping over money trying to invest it in ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING even at a 2-3% return. This is pushing the stock market to insane multiples and real estate assets to a 3.5% cap rate (3.5% return) in large cities.
We've been printing money, but not giving it to the consumer.  AKA, the basket of consumer goods on which inflation is measured is unchanged.

That's the hilarious thing. 
The way money is created in modern times is way more absurd than you might realize.
Bank has $100. Lets say the reserve requirement for this bank is 10%.
Bank lends $90 to Bob, and holds $10 as a reserve.
Bob now has $90.   *Bob deposits his money into the bank.*
Bank now has $90 again (not including the $10 reserve).
The bank now lends $81 to Jill and hold $9 in a reserve. Jill deposits her money into the bank.
Bank now has $81.  They lend $74 to Jackie and hold $7 in a reserve. Jackie deposits her money into the bank.
Bank now has $74.  They lend $68 to Craig and hold $6 in a reserve. Craig deposits his money into the bank.
Bank now has $68. They lend $62 to John, and hold $6 in a reserve. John deposits his money into the bank.
Now: The bank has $62 in cash, and $38 in reserves - equaling the initial $100. However, the below is also true: 
Bob has $90
Jill has $81
Jackie has $74
Craig has $68
John has $62
Total money floating around in the economy: $475.
The bank created this money out of thin air. 
So, the joke above is: Bank starts with $0.  They make a loan of $1 to Bob. Bob is now worth -1 and the bank is now worth +1. (The actual accounting is a bit different, but the joke makes fun of printing money out of thin air).

Underrated post.
It's funny - getting into Bitcoin, the world reveals itself in stages. Every time you peel back another layer, you think you finally 'understand' fiat money, then you realize it's way more bonkers than 99% of people realize. Peel back another layer, rinse and repeat with a new level of shock.
Stages of enlightenment:
1. Realize that USD isn't backed by gold (pretty elementary, but surprising how many Avg Joes don't realize this).
2. Realize US dollar being "backed by the full-faith of the US Government" means literally nothing. "... But it's backed by the government!"
3. Finally understand what "Inflation" is and why it's a thing.
4. Realize that the treasury prints physical money, but that pales in comparison to the amount of digital money ... that the Fed (?)  prints somehow with 'reserves'...?
5. Realize that the Fed has nothing to do with the government, and is a private enterprise. (Wait - are you kidding me? Don't they print money and decide interest rates or something? How is THAT not part of the government?)
6. Still don't really understand how the Fed / Treasury creates new digital money.
7. Realize that individual BANKS THEMSELVES create a vast majority of the "money" that moves through the US economy. "Wait. That can't be legal. Individual Banks can't print money out of thin air".
8. Realize that Banks create money out of this air every time they make a loan; equal to 90% of the loan amount.
9. Realize that when that money is deposited into another bank, THAT bank can create money out of thin air equal to 90% of the deposit amount.
10. Realize what Quantitative Easing actually is, how it affects asset valuations. Stomach drops. 
11. Realize that everything is vapor.
12. Try explaining this to a friend. Everyone now thinks you're a conspiracy theorist, when you recite the real and actual way that money gets created in this country. It's **literally** how the system works, and was enacted by congress, but for some reason... it's so fucking absurd that no one believes you when you tell them.

"GBP being run by a company"  is different than "GBP *operates* as a company".
That's the distinction Alistar is making.
"Intrinsic Valuation" is a specific methodology for valuing companies, and it looks at the revenues and expenses and profitability of the company and spits out a valuation.
Alistarr is saying:
Trying to find an an intrinsic valuation of BTC, USD, or GBP is similar to looking at a tree and saying "what's that tree's horsepower"?  They are applying a measurement used for companies and trying to apply it to currencies.
There is another use of the term "intrinsic value" that people try to use to describe things like gold.  While gold does have utility, it does not have intrinsic value. When used in this context, there is no such thing as intrinsic value.  All value is subjective.  Tomorrow, an asteroid of gold could land in the pacific and the Intrinsic Value^((tm)) of gold would suddenly drop to $0.10 / ounce.   Tomorrow, we could find a method for extracting gold from seawater. These are unlikely, but possible. In these scenarios, did gold magically lose it's "intrinsic value"?   Then you ask - what was so special about calling something intrinsic value, if what we really meant was just "market value"
Gold has long-established market value.  The value is supported by its utility as a conductor.
Similarly, you could say Bitcoin's intrinsic value is its utility as the most-secure decentralized *proof-of-existence* ledger (aka time-stamping PDFs) on earth. A bitcoin gives you the ability to access and change this ledger.  Once you establish that a Bitcoin has a value of anything over $0.000000000, then the value of Bitcoin is insurmountable.
If you assume Bitcoin has a value of even $0.0001, then it becomes the worlds best tool against tyrannical governments that the world has ever seen, and deserves a place in every investor's personal portfolio.  This then becomes a feedback loop. There really isn't an upward bound to the price of a Bitcoin.
 That's why Satoshi Nakamoto said this 10-days after launching Bitcoin: *"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on. If enough people think the same way, that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy".*
We're seeing that self-fulfilling prophesy happening in real-time. There's no stopping it now.
