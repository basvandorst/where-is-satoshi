I mean, if they did it by accident, I would actually be amazed their code can write itself... It kind of goes without saying, but apparently some people still feel the need to say it and others need someone to say it. Then there's the rest of us thinking "no shit".

OP is complaining, not sharing info. The only thing OP is missing to complete his teen sounding complaint is a few emojis and that "100" with the underline emote.

I get OP might have overreacted and you guys didn't intend to put any extra scripts or code. But it's a bit concerning a bitcoin wallet in charge of securing something doesn't actually or actively know what code is in their distributed software. This is the the kind of thing you find during amateur hour. You guys probably shouldn't be in this business if you can't keep track of bugs and software until an inaccurate post shows up BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE SPAGHETTI CODE RUNNING YOUR SOFTWARE. OP didn't know what he's talking about, but he's talking because you guys aren't exactly coming off as competent. 
If there's one thing to remember, it's better to fix your code now than to have a witch hunt in a few months when someone blames you for their missing bitcoins. Get your shit together or stop. 
From OPs interaction with you, you admitted you guys have no fucking clue how to deal with customers. He might have been an ass, but you guys are fucking retarded for responding the way you did. That's fodder for the trolls. Please replace whoever is in charge of your emails and interaction with people, they need a lobotomy before angry people do it with an ice pick.
