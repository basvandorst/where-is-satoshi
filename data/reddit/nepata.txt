Well isn't deflation an increase in purchasing power, so wouldn't it theoretically indicate a growth in "wealth"? Interest paid on debts doesn't have to do with wealth, it is simply a percentage dictated by the markets, or in the case of the US, a central bank.

But the graphic doesn't comment on debts.

Fair enough. But if you are not holding any debt, then holding Bitcoin as a means of wealth storage would be "good" if deflation were to occur, no? I understand what you are saying, why inflation is good in that standard. Would you support a completely decentralized monetary market?

What two camps would those be?

Thanks for the reply. I'm not very well educated on Bitcoin and blockchain just yet. However, I have heard arguments from those opposing an increase to the blocksize limit saying that it would lead to centralization and would essentially defeat the whole purpose. Do you agree with this? If you do agree, why is this the case with an increase in the blocksize limit?

Read [this]( it can explain this much better than I can. But regardless I will try. I would like to preface this by saying that this isn't the *only* way inflation benefits the rich/slants the economy. There is still the issue of it creating a largely debt-driven economy (and government debt of course).
So, the definition I am using of inflation is when freshly printed money reaches circulation and subsequently depreciates the total money supply. The issue is, this does not happen instantaneously. It takes time for the freshly printed notes to inflate the money supply (or more accurately, depreciate it). Some people/organizations have access to this money before it begins to depreciate the money supply, meaning that they can effectively "cheat" the system by gaining access to extra funds before they are devalued, or devalued to the full amount. This would directly apply to those that have access to freshly printed Federal Reserve notes first; I.E. the big banks, and many of those with government contracts. Typically, it goes to the rich first, and makes its way down the system to the main supply of money (I.E. circulation), so the same amount of money is worth more when the rich people use it; than when the rest of the country uses it. Read up on the Federal Reserve and how it functions. There is so much more to it than I understand or could explain.

Printing more money in a fixed money supply doesn't depreciate the value of each unit of currency? Hmm. We have *very* different views of inflation then. If our money is not being depreciated by inflation, then what is doing it?

I am sure they will bail out the banks just as they always have. They will just attempt to do it in secret, through the FED just as in the Great Depression. Failure to do so would be..... Catastrophic. For the government at least.
Interest rates would have to rise. They should have never even been lowered, let alone to a half a percent. But you know how the central banks function, their first line of defense is to lower the rates. I wouldn't at all be surprised to see the FED advocating for negative rates as well.

No, I don't doubt this. I am specifically referring to his saying that inflation hits the rich harder than the poor. It is just a silly notion. Read the comment above his, makes some good points. Our system of inflation contributes to a debt-driven economy, where our government indebts our citizens in order to print more money; to pay for themselves (government). If you read up on the process of how this money reaches circulation, and who has access to this money before it starts inflating the currency (and asset prices as you pointed out), then it becomes very clear that inflation benefits the rich much more than the poor; at least in the US system.

Then you fundamentally misunderstand how inflation works in our system.
