I feel ya, bought more BTC at $18.5k and ETH at $1,325. We're all in this together! Stay strong!
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:56:30
I feel like this news should have spurred more buying, its a big deal for someone with so much power to admin they were wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:20:39
Yes, it looks pretty smooth sailing after that until $15,500, but I'm sure new ones will pop up by then.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:37:36
I may just use my checking account, but its gone up 1.5k since then and I wanted the cash back reward.. oh well
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:16:03
Screw you CapitalOne. I tried to buy more earlier and just saw the email that my transaction was cancelled and refunded. Looked it up and Coinbase is listed as Fraudulent. Now they will probably lock my account...
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:08:16
Its going back up! $13.5k!
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:58:15
What is the best wallet for a large variety of coins? I have heard that most wallets only allow 2-3 different types of coins. I have 14 different coins I want to store away for a long time. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:06:22
Awesome my state is one of the 5! I already use Robinhood for stocks and really like them, so I will most likely move my cryptos there as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:07:56
Here is another, posted today on Investopedia. I do agree with you though.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:59:10
Well on  it says "You can compare using different cost-basis methodologies, including FIFO, LIFO, and average costing, as well as comparing like-kind treatment." Why have the option if its not even legal?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:01:20
Looking at long term graphs it seems like the 2nd to last ATM is always the new floor. So after we hit the next ATH, $19.5k should be the floor. At least I can hope..
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:50:44
If I withdrawal only what I invested and leave the profits then I will have no tax liability correct?
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:25:03
I am thinking if people get refunds they may invest some, so yes.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:17:05
Or it would have people running to it as a way to store their money away from fiat
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:16:05
There has been a lot of talk about Wall Street bonus money flowing in today. Is there any merit to that?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:22:39
You missed the sale.

Just ordered some Chinese food from a local restaurant and saw that they accept bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:38:07
On the EthTrader sub there is a discussion about this. Some are thinking if Bitcoin tanks that all currencies will because people will lose faith in cyrptos. A failure that huge would spark too much fear.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:10:11
Same. I bought a little at 8300 which is great but then I bought a lot at 18500 which has been scary...
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:25:33
But then when I withdrawal that additional $500 at some later point in time wouldn't I have to pay the capital gains tax on it again? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:18:48
I'd buy now, it almost always goes up on Fridays, I'm assuming because that's when people get paid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:06:29
I have never once gotten Coinbase alerts to work. I dont know why its even on there.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:32:59
I've wondered that too lol
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:28:00
Haha yes there already is now! I considered sub $10k to be a sale. Looking at the order book I really thought we would hold over $10k after the first little dip. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:02:49
Dang it, I was in a meeting and missed the 11k take down. Was it just entirely deleted or did it get eaten? I was looking forward to that all day :(
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:44
I thought more people would have set up automatic buys at the $10k mark :\
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:14:25
I simply interpret this as resistance at the $15,150-$15,200 point 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:06:14
I want to play!
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:02:18
Maybe everyone is pulling out to invest in Stocks since a lot are doing incredible. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:09:42
I think there are even more people who bought in December; I think people will just sell and never come back once we reach $17k-$19k levels again. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:53:49
Since you can gift your children assets while you are still alive and count it against your total lifetime estate tax exemption, could I gift my child my bitcoin and then have it cashed out at that time and they owe no capital gains since it is valued at the time of gifting rather than time acquired?
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:15:14
From what I read you can choose FIFO or LIFO but you must stick with that going forward.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:39:22
What is the best way to cash out to fiat to incur the least amount of fees? I have several coins on both Coinbase and Binance. (Don't worry not cashing out Bitcoin!)
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:16:41
Wish I would have known this starting out! I made at least 5 ACH transfers to the coinbase app..
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:02:34
I noticed a similar pattern with ETH earlier. I am assuming bots are putting a certain number of sales at $5 increments. Or it could be a stairway to the moon.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:28:59
I would prefer they both rise equally, so never.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:59:26
Well if it would have deposited when I thought, I would have already made more than that 4% fee back in profits. Then cash out, pay off the card and do it again. End of the day I have lots of rewards.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:05:31
Thought I was smart buying more at the dip Tuesday morning around $18k, then not 2 hours later it plummets and nothing I can do until next Wednesday!   
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:53:20
It's a year end investment strategy. They could have bought high and will use the capital losses to offset their gains for the year.  Look up tax harvesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:17:12
Thank you to whoever posted 70+ buys and helped us blow through that $14k wall!!! That was fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:57:35
I am reading after the Segwit2x fork everyone will get B2X AND BTC equal to what they hold. How is that possible? I must be misunderstanding? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:24:20
I think that could be part of it. I think the main reason though is because people are selling off at year end for tax reasons and they will buy back in in January so I am not worried at all. I am seeing the same things happening with my stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:13:10
What about the additional BTC credit part, that is what I dont think is possible...
"Interestingly, the developers have said that all BTC balances held at fork time will not only be credited with an equal amount of B2X but also a proportional number of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s coins as a reward."
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:15:58
That made me laugh
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:55:07
Wow, I did not expect all this pessimism on here today. I am excited about all the Bitcoin news this week. Try zooming out to the 14 day view! I just bought more.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:43:09
i just learned that all the bitcoin ATMs are built here in KC. Pretty cool!
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:28:59
There is almost no resistance at 10k, this should be easy.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:40:17
Did you use a credit card? My credit card also denies transactions. You need to link it directly to a checking or savings account. You will have to wait a week for any purchase to clear, but you will be locked in at the price you bought. Or you can send money to your USD wallet on GDAX, which will also take a week, but will save you a lot of money in fees.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:46:52
My last purchase was at the $18,500 "dip" so no, don't feel bad. We will get back there plus some.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:50:21
But I am playing with money, not lives... and gambling is fun.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:40:43
Fox4 news in Kansas City is currently showing a Bitcoin 101 special!
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:43:33
What does this mean in layman terms?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:16:37
Me too. I had a limit order set at 9,999 all week and it had been filled when I woke up. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:36:02
My ACH transfer won't hit my account until the 15th. I fully expect the price to go up then because that's what always happens when I try to buy the dip...
