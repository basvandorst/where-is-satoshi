Are you sure?  According to this comment, there is no such think as 100% FOSH hardware?

Point is, it needs to be made clear that hardware wallets are closed source, therefore should not be trusted.  A lot of people are under the impression that hardware wallets are open source.

I have 2 questions:
1. Is this hardware wallet 100% open source software AND open source hardware?
2. If it is not, which hardware wallet is 100% open source for it's software and hardware?

Not sure why this post got so many points, when it is clearly false because trezor has closed source components, such as its microcontroller.  Therefore the claim "hardware and software are completely open source" is completely false.

Not only that, the Raspberry Pi itself is closed source.  No sarcasm intended.

Which is why my private keys never see an online computer.  they are all generated on an offline computer and all transactions are signed on an offline computer. ;)
Closed source components in a trezor can do stuff without you knowing, so when you connect a trezor to an online computer, not many people know what those closed source components do.

I like the sound of a 2 of 3 multisig using different hardware wallets.

No, only when I am unsure.  However, after posting a few of these questions, I realized that my doubt about the "open source" hardware of a trezor has substance.  It is indeed closed source hardware, or at least, has some closed source components.

I am unsure myself why this has not happened yet.  At the same time, kind of scary how the most voted comment in this thread is completely false.

It is not.  It uses a closed source microcontroller.
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:02:49
That is awful.  Why is there no such thing as a 100% open source hardware wallet which is 100% open in terms of hardware and software?  Shocked that it's 2019 and still no such thing as a 100% open source hardware for a hardware wallet.

1. Paper is easy to read. a trezor is encrypted.
   1. This is false, I have used BIP-38 to encrypt paperwallets.
2. So yes it's more secure in that way.
   1. See 1a above, therefore, your claim here is false.
3. it's also more secure in the sense that you never have to enter your private keys into an online device
   1. False again, I sign my paperwallets on an offline computer, before moving the signed transaction to an online computer, therefore the private key for a paperwallet never has to see an online computer.
4. so yes, very much more secure than writing your keys on paper for anyone to read.
   1. Please see all 3 points above to show why your final point is also false.

Bitcoin is open source, trezor has closed source components.  It's not that complicated to understand that closed source components connected to an online computer could broadcast sensitive private key data without you knowing.
However, closed source components in a computer which is always offline and never connects to another online computer is nowhere near as risky as closed sourced components connecting to an online computer.
It really is not that difficult to understand.
