Fun fact: Google most likely already has your banking history, or at least large parts of it, through gmail.

There are accounts that do that. But even if not, PayPal, Amazon, eBay, ... .
For a huge portion o casual America they pretty much know how the financial standings are.

This picture reminds me of one of the flaws of/issues I have with Bitcoin in everyday life: The fact that most everyday transactions will take place in the .thousands, for instance with this. The kid either has to say "That's zero point zero zero zero zero twentythree please" or "That's 23 hounded thousands of an Bitcoin please". 
Or am I the only one who thinks that?

Isn't HODL olding on to your BTC? Isn't that a bit counterproductive if you want to make it a real currency?

I like how random people put their predictions at ridiculous heights but the real economists are like: "1.000.000? nah. hink it will be 100 bucks".
My guess would be that they think it will first normalize it self, become a real and usable everyday currency and then settle it self at about 100.

"can't fund public servants via voluntary funds"
go to gofoundme and have a look on how that´s going
and you, an untrained random responding to an emergency? ha, and you think the number of police kills now is bad, just wait till you show trying to help
and what most you seem to overlook is that, wouldn´t it be for the state, sure police and firefighters might still exist but what about all the other institutions the state provides? courts, just as an example

probably not (fingers crossed)
