Did your crystal ball tell you this?
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:11:14
Because a government would never do such a thing as ban a ponzi!

Market cap has nothing to do with how many coins are being spent. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:57:11
Bullshit. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:15:58
Complete nonsense and voted to the mainpage of course. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 12:53:40
Try reading my post again. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:45:46
it's that simple but many here just don't want to believe this. 
It must be the big banks.

They don't do anything for Bitcoin. They exist because they make money off Bitcoiners. If tomorrow Dogecoin becomes the hype they will instantly switch to that coin. 
People here refuse to understand that all these millions of funding from all these companies are not into Bitcoin. They fund companies that take dirty fiat dollars from Bitcoiners. That's all they care about. 
Yes, just downvote it away. That will make it less true.

Imagine someone trying to learn about Bitcoin and this is the first thing he sees on top of the mainpage...imagine what it looks like for an outsider. 
This sub does so much damage to Bitcoin and you people just don't realize it. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 06:34:30
You're absolutely clueless. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 06:55:48
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-25 17:10:39
Not good is an understatement. But i guess you went for the sensationalist and victim approach, right?
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:10:33
Man, just stop it with these posts. Enough is enough. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:21:01
This nonsense got 10 upvotes and gold. 
Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:06:03
Really? That's the ONLY reason you can think of?
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:49:46
What day is coming and why exactly should one "hodl"? Can you tell me more please. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:43:09
That is because you think as a Bitcoiner. Despite popular believe here bankers aren't shaking in their boots. Really, they aren't. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:15:13
Please try this out in real life and let us know how it worked out for you. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:56:56
You got it all figured out i see. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:08:31
This absolute bs has already been posted a week ago. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:13:56
How many more times will this nonsense get upvoted to the mainpage? Every time some blog rewrites the (non-bitcoin) article from last week?
