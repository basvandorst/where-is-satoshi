I don't remember ever having anything to do with Bitinstant but it's the only explanation for my account being locked. Why can't Gox answer the support tickets and tell us this? Thanks OP!

Mt Gox answered one of my support tickets last night that has been there for 5 days. I've never heard of a Ponzi scammer continuing to play the fiddle when they know the jig is up. My guess is that Gox will march on and skyrocket. I bought the dip.

Oh wow that's not easy. Nice. Well we gotta do what we gotta do I guess if we want our coins back.  Thanks OP.

Amazing what one magically can find when being investigated by the world. Now where's the rest? I'm not settling for that!

I'm surprised that the masses are not focusing on this fact that Gox continued to take in btc and funds and to verify customers while allowing trading to go on knowing this had happened. Criminal charges seem imminent to me also.

I'm at 1.21 now in 3 days and easily have 5 or 6 hours entering transfers over and over. Never sending money or btc here again!

I had someone who owed me money pay me in bitcoin and sent it to my wallet there because it was easily accessible at the moment and now I can't get it out of there. Didn't realize they had non existent volume but I got the message now. Definitely safer exchanges out there.

Have you tried withdrawing anything lately? A few of us are having the same problem. Haven't seen anyone in the online chat. I've been using them for years and never had a problem until this week. I've gotten a little over 0.5 btc out now after dozens of tries in very small amounts.
