That's how I intend to use it.
I'll send the coins there, and then when I went to get them back, I'll just import the key into Electrum.
I'm not going to be using this paper wallet for my day-to-day payments.

So you're saying that it is secure on a technical level?
But people often lose the paper, the paper gets wet, etc?

What is a "real" paper wallet? I thought that generating a private key + address and writing it down is a paper wallet?

Can you develop that a bit?
Are you saying that as soon as I generate an address, it is compromised, all the Bitcoin is stolen and the world will explode?
Or is it safe enough for general use, but there are safer ways to do it if you want to be extra careful?

How do I go about doing this?
Do I just make an Electrum wallet, write down the seed words and then delete the Electrum wallet from my PC?

But is this email actually from Bitmain?
To me it just looks like a poorly made phishing email.

You sneaky pasta! ;D

If no other nodes connect to me then what does my node actually do?
How can I relay transactions if I aren't connected to any other nodes?

To hide my home IP address.

Can you tell me more about the -listen=0 flag where I don't have to open ports?
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:44:59
Yes, please! I'd spend my Bitcoin there right away!
