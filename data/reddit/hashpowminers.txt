I’m sure that anyone with millions of dollars worth of bitcoin is smart enough to cash out small amounts on a regular basis and also trade for other assets to diversify their portfolio.
Bubbles are very profitable. When the hype dies and bitcoin experiences a price correction, you can bet that the heavy bag holders already shorted it.

It’s not really possible to make everyday purchases with crypto yet, at least not without using some centralized crypto debit card with extra fees.
But if you could pay with crypto for regular everyday stuff at the checkout counter without extra fees, would you?

[If you want to use decentralized currencies for payments, do you want to use decentralized payment processors as well or are you willing to use centralized payment processors?](

For those who actually want to make everyday purchases with crypto but are willing to use centralized payment processors: what’s the point?
Using a centralized processor to spend a decentralized currency defeats the purpose of decentralized currencies.

I think it’s more likely that companies will use solutions that allow them to accept many different cryptocurrencies and receive settlement in whichever currency that they like.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:25:22
I was referring to fees set by the centralized processors that facilitate crypto payments. Like all of the crypto debit cards and such. Can’t really expect many merchants to accept crypto wallet to wallet at point of sale.
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:53:33
Yes there are many methods. They just suck. They either require the customer to pay more or the merchant to pay more, or usually both.
The only good method I’ve found is the Graft network. It’s a decentralized crypto payment processing network rather than just another currency. It will allow merchants to accept many cryptos with their existing point of sale terminals.
It has much lower fees for merchants than Visa/MasterCard which will enable them to offer the discount that you mentioned, and it has zero fees for customers. 
It will also allow the merchant to receive settlement in fiat if they want though if they don’t want to speculate on the future.
It will be interesting to see how many people start using it compared to some of the other centralized methods that are being developed.

I’m using 1Broker to copy experienced traders and accumulate more bitcoin. Check out the trader “SaltBae” on there. No losses to date. 
Deposit bitcoin, copy trader, profit (so far).
I still buy the dip when BTC price drops too just to hold. It’s all about accumulating more BTC for the long term hold.

If companies keep the keys/BTC in-house they can’t sue anyone to get it back if it disappears all of a sudden. Their CFO will be in Belize living the dream.

No I’m not. I’m saying that if anything happens to the Bitcoin while it is in the hands of a custodian (coinbase) then the custodian is liable. They have to compensate the institution or file bankruptcy.
If the institution keeps the bitcoin in-house and anything happens to it (whether it be theft by employees or a hack by someone not affiliated with the company) its just a loss. Nothing can be done.

What are you smoking?
For one: Bitcoin is bitcoin. Blockchain is blockchain. They aren’t the same thing. 
Two: bitcoin can be used for p2p digital transfer of currencies. That is all. It’s cool but it isn’t some kind of digital utopia seed as you seem to think.
Three: “entire national decisions” could already be made without blockchain if that is actually what governments wanted. But they don’t. I just digitally voted in my local primaries a couple days ago without blockchain. I voted on elected officials and local propositions relating to education, property taxes, abortion, etc. I did it quickly and easily without blockchain. If governments wanted to allow military decisions to be voted on by the m(asses) then they could easily do that. It’s not like they don’t have the tech lol. They just don’t want to do that. You can provide any tech you want and they still won’t do it. 
Four: trying to force private companies to crackdown on identity verification is a step backwards. It could also be done without blockchain by the way. All that would do is make censorship easier. You might as well add revoking free speech to your list of blockchain dreams as well lol. 
Ps. There is no stupid Russia debate that actually matters. propaganda comes from everywhere to brainwash idiots into thinking certain things. It always has and always will. It’s no different than product advertisements for the must-have gadget that’ll make it easier to scrape Cheerios off of your kitchen floor. It all exists to sway the idiotic masses (who you would have vote on military decisions lol). 
If you aren’t intelligent enough to scroll past the propaganda and make educated decisions in spite of them... then you probably bought bitconnect, and you deserve to spend your days arguing with strangers on Facebook about stuff that doesn’t matter lol

What are you talking about? The person I replied to didn’t say anything about monopolizing. He said that they are here to take your money, track you, and report your information to the IRS. Which is what literally all companies do, and especially financial services companies.
If you want to talk about monopolizing then my response is that it’s not realistic. For one, we have decentralized exchanges. Two: there are already many very profitable and reputable exchanges that make way too much profit for anyone to afford buying them out even if they were stupid enough to sell. I’ve got accounts with more centralized and decentralized exchanges than I can even remember lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:39:03
I’m pretty sure everyone tracks the price of bitcoin. Literally everyone here.

Most aren’t interacting with a 3rd party but the ones that are (hybrids) don’t have access to your funds. They may have matching engines or multi sig gateways but they don’t have your private keys.
The ones that do require you to enter your private keys are the ERC20 exchanges. You enter your Ethereum wallet private key to unlock your wallet just like you would on Myetherwallet to send eth and tokens. The keys aren’t stored anywhere. You are basically just using their interface to interact directly with the blockchain, decrypt your wallet on the blockchain, send ETH, and receive tokens to the same wallet. Orders are placed and executed via smart contract with the transactions being directly between the buyer and sellers personal wallets.
The software of these exchanges tends to be open source as well so you can verify that they can’t see your private key.

Sanctions aren’t murder... refusing to trade with or give charity to another country is not murder. 
It the citizens of a country are dying for any reason other than a military attack by another country then the fault lies with either the government of those citizens, the parents of those citizens, or the citizens themselves. The government is responsible for defending the country and facilitating trade. The parents are responsible for defending and providing for their children. It’s that simple.

Most are focused on ERC20 for now but I know kyber plans to expand to others in the future using oracles to transfer between different blockchains. That’s the real future of DEX’s and crypto in general.
There are a few now that offer trading of multiple blockchains/coins but I think they’re all hybrids that use multi sig and stuff.

I guess they wanted to focus on institutional investors rather than users of their app. 
Just look at the growing pains that all of the crypto exchanges have been going through with the massive influx of new users. They’ve had to hire more people non stop just to keep up with support tickets and they’re all still months behind. It’s a hassle and it causes a bunch of people to talk crap about the company. So it made sense to avoid all of that and only offer those services to institutions.
