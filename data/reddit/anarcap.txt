Yeah, right. Last time inflation got to 40% per month before the currency was dropped. 
Governments tend avoid sacking their currencies for a long time.
Btw, we in Brazil are also already dumping the BRL, even though it gained value from the dollar recently.

All your evidence is just 1 quote from Satoshi? 
He also said that lost coins are like a donation to other coin owners.
Considering that he hasn't move his coin in years and that he could probably have a ton of coins mined later, but still early enough that you could do on a regular computer, it would be irrational for him to ever move his old coins.
His only reason to hold to the secret keys would be to wash of his sand castle, if it ever got out of hand.

A private key is a big number associated with another number, the public key.
A password is a seed to generate another key, which is used to encrypt your private key, in order to maintain it secret.
A paper wallet (or a .wallet file) may have any number of private/public key pairs and the private keys can be encrypted by a password generated key.

The general Byzantine generals problem is traditionally solved by "agreement" . You can read about it in Wikipedia, it is really well explained: 
However, the solution by agreement takes an absurd amount of messages and requires a majority of far more than 51%.
Bitcoin is a solution that consumes much less resources and can be done with a simple 51% majority of hashing power.

Yes. A Bitcoin balance is nothing more than an entry in the accounting book that is the blockchain.
The blockchain is online.
The records in the blockchain only consist of public keys. 
What you must keep secret to secure your funds is your private key. You can generate a private/public key pair offline, store it, and later only publish your public key.

How do you charge your costumers?
You could give them a small incentive. It doesn't need to consume all the 9% in profits. A 5%~10% discount would be enough in most cases.

You are confusing monetary expansion (inflation) with average price increase (price inflation).
Dollar is around 6% "price" inflation. One of the causes is inflation, that is, quantitative easing. US monetary base (M3) tripled in 2010. This is 300% inflation in 2010 alone.
Bitcoin price inflation is negative. Bitcoin monetary base inflation is 11%.

Price changes in bitcoin happened for one reason: Change in the demand. If you don't like bitcoin you can still use other currencies. The value of bitcoins only rise because a sufficient ammount of people chose to use BTC.
Do you really need me to explain the advantage of prices that change routinely based on peoples choices over prices that change arbitrarily from central command?

The price is not low. The price is right. It is the result of people buying an selling. 
If more people come to use bitcoin, its price will increase. The price of bitcoin is a reflex of the amount of people USING bitcoins. 
If you believe bitcoin is going to take off, buy. If you don't, sell.

Yes. You are advocating bitcoin as an investment. It is not. It is a bad investment. It could crash anytime.
The point is: Some altcoin will be the future. We don't know wich one yet. BitCoin might be the orkut, myspace or the napster of the altcoins. 
It is silly to put all your life savings in bitcoins - just not so silly as to put all your life savins into fiat. Gold ins't much better either. Historically it got confiscated and stollen att by government after government.

Banks don`t print money, they just lend more money than they got in stash, effectively multiplying the supply. This is only possible because there is only one currency, backed by the Fed.

Actually, economists defend that an economy should grow to improve the standard of living off the people. It is ready to advocate poverty in the US, but you forgot that the majority of people live in undeveloped countries.
Even in developed countries, an economy should grow to improve its efficiency and make better use of its resources.
Nevertheless, the Keynesian way of measuring the growth of the economy is absurdly wrong. GDP is awful. It is only used by the government because it justifies heavy spending.
What really determinate the growth of the economy is not simple to measure by numbers. Like a forest, you don't simple count the number or size of the trees. You need to take into account the whole ecosystem.

An 120 hour long market cap tells little about the value of bitcoin. The volume of transactions normalized to its price tells much more.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:09:50
Difficulty is one of the many factors that drive the value up.
Difficulty is the way the network enforces the controlled rate of inflation of Bitcoin.
Since bitcoin only has value because the supply is limited, bitcoin only has value because the successive increases in difficulty.
Without the increase on difficulty there would be no price increase.

This is the coolest charto ever posted on Austrian economics predicts that the value of currencies is somewhat proportional to the amount of transactions. 
This is one more confirmation. 
What follows from this:
1) hoarding does not affect (much) the price. 
2) day trading does a little bit
3) investing affects a lot
3) the more people use bitcoin for actual useful stuff, the more the price will rise.

When prices of goods and services change based ond supply and demand it is not inflation or deflation. Goverment just calls it that way for their convenience.
What gives value to the dollar today is that it is used as reserve by other countries. 
Lately China is buying a lot of gold. When they decide to use gold as currency for trading oil, the dollar will be doomed.
Prices in the USD will skyrocket and the US goverment will somehow blame North Korea and attack China (joke intended).

First of all, what you mean by intrinsic demand for Bitcoins?
There is some demand for bitcoins, or else no one would buy it, intrinsic or not.
Second, famine is the result of shortage of food. 
Price fixing causes shortages. Rent control causes housing shortage, interest rate manipulation cause credit bubbles or credit shortages an so on.
I'm assuming you are against price fixing in most goods in the economy. Why are you in favor of fixing the price of the good that is half of almost every transaction in the planet: money?

@_date: 2013-07-05 17:13:26
I've talked about this many times already, but here it goes again:
The price of bitcoin in dollars should be proportional to the volume of the transactions:
If you check the link above, you'll see that the volume of transactions today (july) is about the same as it was in march. This means that the price of bitcoin will drop to about the same it was in march, that is, 40 USD.
There are many factors that introduce flutuations in the market, but those that are in bitcoin for the long term must know: Its value is gonna go up 10.000 fold, but it will take a long time, not 2-3 months.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:11:52
