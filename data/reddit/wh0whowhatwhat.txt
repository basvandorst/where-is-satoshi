Did you buy a yacht or a Lamborghini, or both?

Really curious how your buys turned out after the dip-you come out ok?

Right, I understand Roth’s can use gbtc, but the premium is absurd as you point out. Hopefully competion from other products will bring the premium down.  I read somewhere else-I’ll try to find the source-that avoiding the transactional costs of holding bitcoin directly is worth about 2-5% (purchase fees, transfer and holding in a wallet, maintenance, etc). That seems totally reasonable, but 10%+ just seems excessive. The tax benefits still likely far outweigh the costs at 10%, but it just seems with the rush to index funds it could be done for less... I guess I should shut up and start my own etf I suppose.

Buy an island, populate it with hookers and blow and a good doctor to keep you alive as long as possible.

Well if they get approval from the SEC they should be able to buy and sell the underlying bitcoin, just like any other etf. I think gbtc can’t do that by order of the SEC, hence the run up in price due to excessive demand from people that either don’t know or don’t care about the excessive premium they are paying.

I think volatility may drop but not sure why value would. Can you explain?

Hopefully this will help create a way to invest in bitcoin within a Roth IRA (unless there is a safe way already out there)?  Gbtc should come back down in line with its btc holdings value so it’s safe for investing in.

More faith? I think most goods still being priced in fiat is the biggest factor.  That and selling carries with it the fear of missed future gains.

If WSB is shorting bitcoin, buy all the bitcoin you can afford.

I don’t think you understand what the word government means.
