What about all those threads about all these different companies developing their own blockchains I **always** see on Do you really think that bitcoin is irreplaceable because its blockchain is filled with gigabytes of literal garbage transactions, defunct links to child pornography, libertarian diatribes, and dust?
@_date: 2015-06-24 14:13:45
I did answer your question. Your question is irrelevant. It's like asking which is going to be king of the social media world, makeoutclub or friendster.
"I'm not going to answer your question because you FUDDER!!!!" isn't fooling anyone, because you know there is no inherent worth to the bitcoin blockchain and the transactions it's recorded.
If amazon created an amazon-coin that was redeemable for products on their site it would decimate bitcoin overnight.
One thing I do find amusing is how people like you will do a complete 180 depending on who you're arguing with. Criticize bitcoin for almost no growth in economy or usage? Bitcoin is a new technology you need to give it time. Point out that bitcoin could easily be eclipsed in the near future? Bitcoin will always be king because it's been around so long.
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:14:51
How can you believe bitcoin is decentralized? 6 mining pools control ~75% of the network. That's also harboring under the assumption that they're all on the up and up and no collusion is occurring. Visa payment processing is more 'decentralized' than bitcoin mining. FFS one dude is in charge of all the major bitcoin discussion forums.
Amazon wouldn't have to maintain a network, they could premine a bunch of coins and use their market presence (which is higher than the market cap of the entire bitcoin ecosphere) to add real value and utility to their coin. Satoshi did the exact same thing with bitcoin. Literally at any time he could dump the 1 million coins he has stashed away.
But I digress, you're still conflating the issues. Do you really think that the chinese bitcoin miners that run the show really give a shit about American libertarian philosophy and wouldn't switch over to Amazon-coin if it was more stable and around the same profitability?
Face it bud, the bitcoin blockchain is pretty much worthless in and of itself for anyone except law enforcement, and the 'network effect' you overestimate only matters as long as the cryptocurrency show is run by amateurs. If and when the big boys get involved with crypto, it spells doom for your 'investment'.

I could create 10 bitcoin clones tonight if I wanted to.
You're conflating worth and price. There's literally nothing in the bitcoin blockchain that makes it inherently more valuable than any altcoin or future coin. Arguably the sheer amount of bloat already in it makes it worthless for anything other than, as the justice system eloquently put it, prosecution futures.
What makes you think the bitcoin blockchain is so valuable?

Short answer: yes.
However this trial is irrelevant to that question because Ross knew exactly what was being transacted on the site and personally brokered large deals.
The most serious of charges are over the deals Ross personally had a hand in, and the Silk Road evidence is just that: evidence in support of those charges.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:45:46
He has already been indicted on the murder-for-hire charges. This trial just supersedes those charges, Maryland is still waiting their turn for him.

@_date: 2015-01-14 03:33:35
Do you have a source for that Snowden claim? I looked around a bit and couldn't find anything. But let me just say:
*  You're talking about international courts, which don't matter at all. That's a completely different jurisdiction and, quite frankly the federal prosecutors couldn't give less of a shit about what the ICC thinks about this case.
*  Edward Snowden hasn't been tried in the US, so there isn't any legal precedent for anything Snowden related in the US court system.
*  I think you might be confusing the issue of NSA surveillance with the investigation of the Silk Road. AFAIK there is no overlap between the two, so any rulings on the NSA data don't matter here.
*  The notion that you can somehow shield yourself with immunity if you just conduct illegal actions over the internet under a pseudonym is ludicrous. Like, on par with "an undercover cop has to tell you they're an undercover cop" level of ludicrous. Sure, they have to tie the real person to the online persona with evidence, but they have to do that for every aspect of a crime. If what you're saying is true, I think Kevin Mitnick would be very interested in hearing it.
* They don't have just circumstantial evidence. There is **a lot** of evidence they've gathered that Ross=DPR. This is what a lot of the trial will center around.
As far as your personal beliefs, I have a few thoughts on that as well. I really don't like the false dilemma that Ross defenders have presented that you either are in love with the Drug War and Drug Policy of the United States or you think Ross is a hero. 
Ross Ulbricht absolutely deserves to be put into federal prison. He's not a hero, he's a tinpot drug kingpin whose ineptness is comical. His proponents (fringe ancaps and fanatical crypto speculators) shit out  baseless claims about his ideological crusade, but it is all lies. Ross wasn't concerned with 'taking violence out of the drug trade and bankrupting the drug cartels'. 
When the opportunity seemingly arose, he leapt at the chance to directly enter into a partnership with drug cartels (Hell's Angels). He tried to have 3 innocent people **murdered** because they committed the crime of living with someone he thought scammed him. Not only murder them because they stood in his way, but because he wanted to take their property as recompense for what he thought was rightfully his. 
The Silk Road has left plenty of victims in its wake. Do you think the victims of the hacking tools and programs sold on the Silk Road are somehow not victims? Do you think anybody injured or killed by a weapon illegally procured through The Armory (a Silk Road offshoot he created) are somehow not victims? Do you think the wife and children of the ex-employee he thought he had assassinated are not victims?
Even the claim of 'lowering violence' is dubious at best. There is no evidence that the Silk Road impacted street level drug dealing at all. In fact, there's plenty of evidence that street level dealers bought their product OFF OF SILK ROAD to sell on the streets. Drug cartels absolutely rejoiced at the concept of Silk Road, the elimination of middle men benefits them more than anyone.
I think you could benefit from looking at what Ross Ulbricht actually did through a critical eye instead of an ideological one.

**Mark Karpeles** - Nuff said.
**Charlie Shrem** - Currently in federal prison for laundering money for the Silk Road
**Roger Ver** - Ultimate shill/Bitcoin Jesus (an angel investor). Considered persona-non-grata in the United States. Has personally donated 130,000 dollars to the Ulbricht defense.
***Everyone under this line is not currently a convicted felon (afaik)***
**Gavin Andresen** - Arguably instrumental in the creation of bitcoin, holds critical access keys to the technology. Also created "ClearCoin, an escrow-type of service, which was closed circa June 23, 2011 [6 months after Silk Road opened]."
**Peter Vessenes** - Creator of Coinlabs, a "bitcoin business incubator". Entered into partnership with MtGox, this sums it up:


Later filed a lawsuit against MtGox for something like 75 million dollars (pre-implosion).
**Patrick Murck** - A lawyer who apparently specializes in avoiding Fincen regulations. Dubious credentials. 
I dunno too much about the last 2 guys.
**Satoshi (pbuh)** - ?????
All rabid ancap/libertarians. Defenders of liberty, enemies of tyranny (taxes/laws). All profited **immensely** from the bitcoin train. Welp, this all checks out! Nothing dubious here!
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:12:34
Do you realize how insane that sounds? 
Let me ask you, if you had started a multi-million dollar black market website and the people you handed it off to said "Oh hey why don't you go ahead and take all those bitcoins we made and can you go to this library for us in a month?" how fucking stupid would you have to be to say "SURE!"?
I also take it that Ross has noooo idea who the *REAL* DPR is either?


Sorry, I thought this was the thread to discuss the Silk Road trial, not the FREE ROSS circlejerk emporium? I'm genuinely interested in what the other side has to say because that's how you actually refine your opinions..
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:35:48
Well the Maryland charge is also a federal charge, and that one is over him trying to arrange a hit with an undercover cop.
They're probably not going to charge him with the 5 other attempted assassinations because in all honesty it looks like Ross was being scammed on those, and they can't find the other participants. So while they might use those as evidence, I'd imagine it'd just muddy the one they have in the bag. This is just my opinion though, I'm not a federal prosecutor.
There's a pretty comprehensive timeline of the events surrounding silk road's downfall, I don't have the link offhand but I'll try and find it. It's pretty amazing actually, because it looks like Ross was not only being played by the feds but being scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by sophisticated scam artists. I really think it (and BTC in general) plays out like something out of a Coen bros movie.
edit:  here it is.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:24:44
That appears to be what the defense's case is. That Ross created it as an "economic experiment" and handed it off after a few months later to the "real DPR".
The problem with that is that the Feds have several pieces of evidence that directly tie DPR to Ross throughout the life of the Silk Road.", as well as the 100k+ bitcoins tied to the Silk Road in Ross's possession. But that is what the trial will determine.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:41:03
Ok this made me bust out laughing, please tell me this guy is a troll..

On the third point IIRC he is actually still being charged with at least some of the murder-for-hires, they are just being moved to a separate trial in Maryland. That court is just waiting for their turn.
Here is where the Free Ross nutjobs had to issue a correction on their own site about it:
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:24:36
I'm not jailing anyone. My opinions and posts will literally have 0 impact on the trial.
I 100% defend the right that Ross Ulbricht has to a fair trial, and would loudly denounce a miscarriage of justice. But, as the judge told him the other day: "Defendant points to “the sheer volume of evidence of illegal transactions by Silk Road users”, but a criminal defendant is not entitled to preclude evidence simply because it is incriminating and there is a lot of it."
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:39:16
So if you personally had evidence of something particularly damaging on the CEO of Monsanto and he sent a hit squad to take you out, you would not only feel he was justified but acting ethically?
Using your arguments, you seem to think the proper and righteous course for the US would be to send a hit squad after Snowden.
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:31:11


You're either misinformed or lying. Ross created a branch of the Silk Road explicitly for weapon sales but shut it down due to lack of demand.
Ross also had no ethical qualms with trying to break into the illegal arms business, as per the article:


@_date: 2015-01-14 00:52:07
Do you mean why wouldn't they? Keep in mind, like I said I'm not a federal prosecutor or a lawyer, just someone who is interested by this case, so if anyone wants to come in here and correct me feel free.
Keep in mind the Maryland trial is still going to happen in a federal court.
The Maryland murder indictment happened over a year ago. It was filed before they even knew who DPR was, but kept under wraps until his arrest out of fear that he would destroy the evidence. It was a long going undercover investigation that culminated in the arrest of his employee (chronicpain) and DPR's subsequent hit.
The current indictment that's on trial now is a different investigation altogether afaik. They probably wanted to take these charges to trial first since it will save a lot of time during the murder trial having those questions (i.e. the involvement of DPR in the Silk Road and whether or not Ross is DPR) already answered by a previous court case. Though that is entirely my speculation. It's hard to get actual info on the cases happening because of his supporters trying to obfuscate the actual reality of the investigation and trial on the internet.

No, commission as in the definition of commission in business:

"foreign banks may charge a commission"
synonyms:	percentage, brokerage, share, portion, dividend, premium, fee, consideration, bonus; More
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:54:56
Sure. However if you look at the evidence (and despite what his defenders say, there is **a lot** of) it's pretty certain that it is Ross.
For example, an undercover agent was having a chat with him online literally at the moment they busted him and the messages were opened on the laptop Ross was using. A conversation specifically so that they could tie Ross to DPR.

How did he take violence out of the drug war? Even ignoring the murder-for-hire charges, he not only facilitated and capitulated to violent cartels, he explicitly tried to partner with who he thought was the Hell's Angels.
He wouldn't have put any cartel out of business. Despite his rhetoric, the only exceptional thing he did was to potentially lower their operating costs.

I don't feel that I am, all of these people could be incredibly stand up in person. However, every one of those people have key skills that would make them invaluable to the creation and maintenance of the SR. Not that they were, but I'm trying to look at it through the lens of the Ulbricht bombshell today.
I got my dubious credentials source from [this page]( and from digging through some posts of his it seems that fincen regulations and what to do to not have them was his area of expertise, but I did caveat with "I dunno too much about the last 2 guys." 
But he did arguably profit immensely from the bitcoin train, if not monetarily he did become the head of it after it all fell apart.

Was that gross revenue? I thought it was that over 1 billion flowed through there, but I believe Silk Road took a 10% cut? So the 170k in btc is not unreasonable for that to be what Ross had on hand considering the price of coin at the time, at the high mark it would have been over 200 million dollars.

5. Scan QR code.
6. Choose amount
7. Make sure you didn't accidentally mix up what you wanted to send, and your transaction fee.
8. Click Send.
9. Realize your private key wasn't strong enough and all your bitcoinz were swept within 2 minutes of going into your wallet by one of the many bots that automatically scours the blockchain.

Hmm, let's take a look here..


An account number that provides limited access to a bank account for public use, that gives all necessary information to deposit money but no information to allow withdrawals from that same account. Seems like a pretty textbook example of cryptography...

Wait, the withdrawal problems were a result of the traditional banking system and *not* a lack of liquidity at MtGox?
That's great news, so when is everyone going to get reimbursed (besides you, of course, since making that video was the price you paid to get your money out before everyone else). Could you elaborate on what specific practices of the traditional banking system were causing the withdrawal problems?

Even that is dubious. I really like the concept of chargebacks, and accept credit cards for my business. Since I'm a flesh and blood human I find myself somehow being both a 'vendor' AND A 'consumer'.
I'm not worried about someone trying to get a chargeback from me because it's not a magical spell that takes away money. I simply have to prove that I provided the service for my client, which is not a problem. I've never even had someone attempt to do a chargeback on me. 
I'm pretty sure the only businesses that are so plagued by chargebacks that they'll switch to a completely alternate currency to bypass them are shady as fuck. Ironically, all efforts to provide a chargeback-like system for bitcoin are most likely alienating the only vendors that are attracted to bitcoin in the first place, in my opinion.
So fwiw I would stop using "No chargebacks" as the number one selling point when trying to attract legitimate business.

Right, creating usable highways for consumer, commerce, and industry, as well as our military and government, had nothing to do with economic progress.
I forgot how the highway system led to the downfall of western civilization. I'm always telling my friends "Just think how great this country would be if there weren't an easily traversable intercontinental series of roads spanning this nation. To think that I can travel from Los Angeles California to Jacksonville Florida on one road, we should burn Eisenhower in effigy."
Funnily enough, I'm an owner in a business heavily intertwined with the construction industry and somehow the existence and maintenance of government funded municipal roads have never been a hindrance! 
Even in your criticism of them, you concede that there is an entire market based around the highway system lol. Just admit your oh-so-clever platitude is dead wrong instead of squirming around trying to make it work.

Uhh no, you need beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. That's a world apart from undeniable proof.
A tumbler isn't really going to keep you from any consequences if anybody gives enough of a shit to care about you. What it *will* do is implicate you in other unrelated crimes and put you on a different investigation's radar.
If your hope is that you can't be convicted of one crime because your bitcoin actually ties you to a different crime I got bad news for you..

It's roughly 1% of all bitcoins currently in existence. So yes, enough to make a difference on price.
Also, pretty sure they haven't commenced the full on dump yet, this is just the anticipatory tremor. I'm thinking sub 150 before it's over..

And the ability to send bitcoin requires having wallet software first, so that excludes 99.9 percent of the planet.
And the ability to have bitcoins requires buying them in the first place which requires having a bank account, so all those steps are required anyways. Before you say "B-but muh localbitcoins" I can easily use paypal cash, or a prepaid debit card, or western union, or literally anyone with a debit card to turn my cash into money online.
And the ability to send money by texting doesn't require a bank account, ever hear of M-Pesa?

How is that literally ANY different than putting out a public key?
In fact, the IBAN is *even more* private because you literally can't do anything else with that information besides SEND HIS ACCOUNT MONEY. You realize anyone who has your public key can see every single transaction that you have ever been involved in and the balance of that wallet in perpetuity. If you bought a pair of alpaca socks from me 3 years ago I know incredibly intimate details of your finances if I cared to look.

So, for my business, I have to essentially pay double what I would pay for a CC processing fee, and on top of that pay 1% extra to provide a facsimile of what was already standard in the already lower CC processing fee? Not to mention that now I have to deal with the clusterfuck of entering escrow with every client that pays with bitcoin, which I'm gonna have to spend time managing.
How does this make any sense to you?

I would argue that the amount of gold entering circulation is much easier to predict than the amount of bitcoins in the future. The 21 million bitcoin mark is completely arbitrary and can change with consensus. You are literally talking out of your ass to say that there is a hard limit of 21 million bitcoins that can never be overcome.
