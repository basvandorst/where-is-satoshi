First some background: when a transaction hits the network it moves from node to node. Each node can decide on its own to forward it or not. 'Proper' transactions will be forwarded. Likewise, nodes that mine may include 'Proper' transactions in their next block. A transaction is accepted as soon as it is in thee blockchain.
All of that gets more complicated because the order of events is different for each node and thee blockchain is not known until much later (even the six block confirmation is not 100% assured, but it is good enough).
A proper, pending transaction may dropped only if it is a double spend. When you initially see a transaction, it is either the first of a double (or more) spend, the second. If you see that it is the second, you know it is invalid and you will drop it/refuse payment. If it is the first, there may be a second double spend transaction.
Thus you want to know, what are the chances there will be a second transaction (double spend) and what does it cost the crook to pull this off. One way is for the crook to send out two transactions at the same time, but to different parts of the globe. Then there is a 50/50 shot a minor across the globe will take the 'other' transaction as the 'first' one. If you wait a bit, you'll see the second transaction get issues and you can refuse payment. The time for a transaction to saturate the network is within 10 seconds.
If the crook has his own mining operation, he does not have to publish the second transaction and can attempt to mine it him/herself. Then you have no idea until the next block is mined. Then you have to know what are the chances the crook's miner will get the next block (this is where 51% attack fear comes from). This situation is described [as a Finney attack here](
TL;DR: wait for network saturation or t=V*T/B so around 10 seconds for $100 or less

That was the dumbest thing I've read all day.

Fees with Coinstar are a total of 9%.   
4% fee + BTC priced about $200 over Coinbase.
I tried it today.

Down 5% in the past hour are you kidding me?

If the stock market crashes people will just sell BTC to pay bills
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:49:25
Bitcoin is slow? That's news to me. I've been sending BTC for over 6 years with the only issues occurring last month before transactions were batched. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:19
Sounds like you're late to crypto and are desperately wanting Nano to be the next big thing because you're already invested in it. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:05:19
They're billionaires who have held since $8. They don't care about spreading misinformation to make even more money.
@_date: 2019-09-26 22:36:01
Shouldn't it increase *faster* this time though? Since we now have price data after two halvings, the trend will continue..
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:56:29
Even if I was stupid rich I'd never buy a sportscar, it's ridiculous and attracts attention.

People will use the Bitcoin ledger to sign videos in the future, to avoid deepfake controversies

You don't need a new private key for each transaction, your wallet should be able to generate any number of public addresses

Why should banks be allowed to make interest on money that is printed out of thin air?
And then, when banks fail, the fed prints a bunch more to bail them out. How is our current system feasible?
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:53:11


Other companies are already doing this. Microsoft is building a way to verify your identity on the Bitcoin blockchain. It's going to be awesome.

So tired of these 10+ minute videos for something that could be summed up in a few paragraphs.
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:01:57
Would you rather hear it from somebody that doesn't have or believe in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:27:06
Because your point doesn't necessarily make sense. Just because you're used to living with 3% inflation doesn't make it the "correct" way.

All that wealth in one spot, with no way to easily move it undetected. Gold seems like a joke compared to Bitcoin.

The US wastes too much money on military. Trillions of dollars get "lost" because they are unaccounted for. What bullshit.
