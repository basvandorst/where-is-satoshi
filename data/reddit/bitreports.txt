No, bitcoin would not be backed by gold, or vice versa. Bitcoin is unique in its ability to produce uncontrolled and unmonitored transactions as well as its distributed tracking and audit-trail credibility. Banks don't like bitcoin because as it gains momentum, they (as middlemen) become redundant. Governments hate it because they cannot generate tax revenue from bitcoin transactions (they typically attack the middlemen for compliance). Waiting for either of them to get on board is a loser's game - they won't. 
Maintaining the position of bitcoin as a speculator's free-for-all simply creates yet another fiat currency without tangible underpinning. The M3 number ceased being published in 2005 and with it went all hope of monitoring the true value of the US Dollar. 
I acknowledge my naivete. But wouldn't it be great if bitcoin could not only position itself as the world's trading currency, but also as the world's currency standard? 
In my opinion it will never get there under the current financial regime. My suggestion of tying it to a tangible hard asset that is well-positioned within the existing financial structure bypasses the need for the approval of anything or anyone. The relationship between gold (limited hard asset, difficult to trade) and bitcoin (limited soft asset, easy to trade) could be played well in the media and it would not be a leap to expect a relatively prompt acceptance of bitcoin as the retail face of gold. 
Obviously Mr(s) Winklevoss et al would not like the grounding. But it would only be a matter of time (probably short) that the price of gold becomes driven by the price of bitcoin, and that price would likely soar, especially against worldwide fiat currency fluff.
