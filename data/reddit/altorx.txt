This is driving me nuts.  I have a small balance on havelock also, and it's been sitting in withdraw escrow for about a month now.  I've emailed and even tried calling them, but they just ignore me.  Argh!

No, but support did reply saying they needed extra details that proved it really was me.  I've replied with those and more and verification pics with me, photo ID, and name on ID that matches my username in havelock.  I think that's pretty solid proof it's me.. but no response since.  I've just started contacting lawyers in Panama to see if they can at least send an official-looking letter threatening legal action to maybe scare him into giving me my money.  If you want, I can include your contact as well when I contact the lawyers.

Have you thought about doing a child pays for parent transaction to boost it?

There was a payout today (Jan 30) -- 
My withdrawal is not there. So frustrating to have many other people withdraw but not me. Anyone else not get theirs yet?

Not enough miner's fee?

I've heard some people got withdrawals today.   is the transaction.  Unfortunately, I'm not on it.

I think demonstrating that credible people who they would trust think bitcoin is an important innovation is a good strategy.  Just took a quick look, and found  and 
“Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value”
Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google
“Bitcoin is a technological tour de force.”
Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder
That such credible people think bitcoin's technology is so significant means it's definitely not a ponzi scheme (and a very good answer about what just might be the biggest technological advancement in our lifetime).

I'm pretty sure if he had to go through all that, they have some security process on the chat support.  Even if they didn't enter a PIN, the procedure should be to insist on a support method that can be authenticated.
The fact that his experience and the criminal's experience is so different makes me think it was an inside job, like you said (though I wasn't sure if you were referring to an inside job by someone at Canadian Bitcoins, or someone at the rogers support data center).
I feel bad for Canadian bitcoins, they were the first way I bought bitcoins and it was a very smooth experience.  I hope they get a good settlement.  It's not their fault at all.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe they should have had some of encrypting the wallet so that even in root mode, a decryption password would have to be entered.  But I have no idea about the technical details or their process to know if that's feasible or not.

I also work for a number of US clients and have started requesting wire transfers or paypal.  It takes two weeks just for the cheque to arrive, then 30 more *business days* before you have access to the funds (and that's the fastest clear time I could find).  It's one of the major reasons I'm pro-bitcoin.  It's just ridiculous.
I did request bitcoin, from these clients, but no go. :(

What site are you using?
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:33:06
Rogers never asked:


So I guess it could have been an inside job at Rogers.  The specific chat person was ready to make it look like they were careless and gave the funds to an unknown person, when really they were working together?

Yeah, I put some money in there just a week or two before he disappeared.  It still makes me a bit upset -- to me, most likely, he just walked away with the money, and there's not really anything we can do about it.  But I guess it's an option that he got murdered or something...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:25:04
Did you ever get your money?
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:27:46
Just a followup, I finally did receive my withdrawal.  So it took in total about 5 months.
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:19:16
It was with blockchain.info.
To be fair, I originally made the transaction with no mining fee at all, since it was to cold storage, I didn't really care how long it took.  However, blockchain then put the bitcoins back to my account (after about 12 hours).  So I tried again, this time with 0.001 fee to make sure it would go through.  Just looking now, I see the original transaction DID go through, and the second one with 0.001 fee is flagged as a double spend.. :S
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:15:07
I'm trying to transfer 1.5 btc with a 0.001 fee, which is quite high.  It's been 1 hr 34 min now unconfirmed.  Could you imagine paying at a restaurant or store and waiting this long to confirm?
When it first went through, it said the network propagation was 200+ nodes, and now it's down to 4..
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:14:14
Regardless, the fact is the quickest transaction confirmation I've had is about 2 minutes.  Most are 10 minutes or more.  If I were at a grocery store and my debit card took 2-10 minutes, I'd be pretty pissed (as would the people behind me).  There will have to be some sort of solution to this for brick-and-mortal retailers to use bitcoin.

In soviet Russia, customer charge exchange fee!
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:58:07
Yes, it makes sense.  My frustration is in how long it took, and with blockchain for refunding the amount back to my account if it was still going to go through - at least it would have been helpful to show a message explaining what happened, whether I should try again, that the bitcoins are not lost, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:18:56
Nope, just transferring btc from one address to a cold storage.  Is it safe to paste the blockchain.info link?  Someone could identify that's me if I do that?  In any case it's at sitting at "Estimated Confirmation Time: Very Soon" for the last two and a half hours now..  Eventually blockchain will just put the btc back to my account and give up on the transaction right?
