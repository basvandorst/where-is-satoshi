Right.  I'm sorry to have assumed good faith here, but if you do have anything you'd like us to look into, just let me know.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:32:26
Tell me more about that, and I'll see if Linh wants to follow up on it?
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:23:52
Exactly.  "If you keep some, in 2-3 years it may be worth a LOT more."  Or: "If you keep some, in 2-3 years it may be worth a LOT less."
If Bitcoin starts to catch on and go mainstream (there are some early positive signs) then yeah.  If the current media fascination and fad fades out, then not so much.  There is a possible future in which bitcoin continues to trade amongst a very small population of geeks but no one else cares and the value becomes difficult to sustain.  BTC at $1 is not unthinkable.  BTC at $10,000 is not unthinkable.
For me personally, I'm going to hang on to my 0.1BTC and possibly buy more and possibly sell some and so on, just for fun.  (I used to be a currency trader professionally.)
But for Wikimedia, it just doesn't make sense to hold a speculative asset.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:09:18
Well, the Wikimedia Foundation board is quite accustomed to "chaotic" - it's Wikipedia after all. :-)  But there are some real practical objections that I fear too many bitcoin enthusiasts gloss over.  And, unfortunately some of them seem far too eager to anger and assumptions that aren't true.  Most are very nice though. :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:23:37
Then you don't know me very well.  Nothing wrong with that, but if you did know me, you'd know I wouldn't feel right keeping money given to me under these conditions.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:59:31
Exactly.  Scientifically we can leave open the idea that perhaps due to the unique characteristics of the bitcoin community, in particular their generosity and enthusiasm to prove that BTC works, the donations gained would offset the donations lost.
But it is important for us to think about those lost donations and why that happens.
At Wikimedia, we have millions of donors per year.  Most are not the kind of hard-core geek who make up the bitcoin community.  But most *are* pretty far along on the geek scale.  They are exactly the type of people who have been thinking a lot about BTC.
If we show them a donation page that accepts BTC, they are going to go "oooh, shiny!" and click on the link all excited to go and finally learn how to get some BTC.  Two hours later, they'll be reading this reddit thread.  And they won't have donated. :-)
Ok, that's just a hypothesis.  But I think there's something to it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:28:30
That's good to know.  What are the typical costs associated with the USD conversion rate?  Is there a fee around that, and what is your bid/ask spread on converting in each direction (this is normally the largest cost in conversions).
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:37:00
That would be a reasonable place to start, I think.  And then further research and A/B testing could happen in due course.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:21:02
Well when 2 or 3 people were giving me money "for a cup of coffee" or "for a beer" I didn't feel like I had to give it to the Foundation since it was just people being nice.  But it sort of blew up overnight into nearly 3BTC (2.86 at the moment) so obviously I'm not going to keep that for myself.
One of my questions is how I can (later on) stop people from cluttering up my personal address with donations they hope go to the Wikimedia Foundation.  This is obviously not the best way to do that. :-)
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:14:38
Well, you are very welcome to enjoy Wikipedia without donating, so try not to worry about it too much, ok?
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:37:33
 is something you will likely find interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:17:52
Haha.  I don't mean it that way, really.
A lot of people would like to see us add a banner on every page "Now accepting Bitcoin!"  Mostly I fear people are thinking more about the benefit to Bitcoin rather than the benefit to Wikipedia, which would be limited in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:24:04
Well that's part of what my playing around is to discover.  But is what you say accurate?
If I want to send you money using BTC versus using Paypal, it seems about the same amount of effort to me.  I have to log in, type in an identifier for you (BTC address, email address) and hit send.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:22:45
Crazy ideas are good and fun.  But they often don't work well in practice.  (Sometimes they do, which is why they are worth thinking about!)
Some people find microdonations and the idea of microdonations very appealing.  But it turns out that consumers don't generally find it appealing at all.  If you offer consumers the chance to pay a tiny amount each time they listen to a song, versus a flat monthly fee, they prefer the flat monthly fee.  There is cognitive cost to every transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:01:49
I think that's probably right, but I think a valid counterargument would be the classic "minimum viable product" argument.  I.E. some would argue that we should slap together the simplest possible page and test it.
One problem we have in all of our A/B testing is that a few large donations really skew test results.  That is, for every million banners shown, we might sometimes get $1000 donation, and sometimes not, and that really screws up testing, meaning that we have to run surprisingly large tests to get real results.
But this is getting way ahead of ourselves.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:28:51
Well I have a relatively minor problem in that I set this up as a personal account and getting flooded with donations was just an accident. :-)  So I need to figure out how to make sure people don't keep using this address.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:02:23
That's exactly right.  "Oooh, shiny!"
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:18:54
Well, this is one of the challenges for the adoption of Bitcoin more generally.  It will come with time, if it is to come at all.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:36:09
Thank you for your kind words.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:15:37
If it were for my personal account, I'd just hang onto it, just for the fun.  Certainly for the 0.1 that I bought, I'll just hang on to that no question.
But for the nonprofit organization, it's not really the right thing to do to sit on a speculative asset.  Irresponsible.  Nonprofit financial management is of necessity boring if done properly. :-)
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:27:18
There is a legitimate alternative view that you should consider if you are putting a significant portion of your personal wealth into Bitcoin.  There is a chance that Bitcoin won't break out of geek subculture and current prices will prove unsustainable and it will fall to less than $1.
I'm not predicting this, and I'm not predicting that you are right either.  I am saying that you don't know, and since you don't know, you might want to be careful.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:15:38
Yes I've considered doing an AMA, but I've never quite gotten around to it.  I want to do it the right way with some planning and letting people know in advance and such like that.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:56:16
I think there's no such thing as "free" conversion to USD.  There's always a bid/ask spread - even for Coinbase.  Crossing the spread is a cost.
(I used to be a currency trader.)
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:09:47
I've done a lot of reading but at first glance, that looks like a great essay.  I'm saving it and will read it later today.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:54:41
Yes, well, I thought someone would send me a couple of bucks.  In retrospect I should have imagined that it might accidentally go a little bit viral.
Given that I've already done it, though, I'm not sure what the best way is to "shut it down" in a few days.  I don't want to have to keep cashing it out and donating to the Wikimedia Foundation in the long run - that's not a very efficient or safe way to do anything!
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:14:07
What I've said for a long time continues to be true.  I'm "cautiously pessimistic" about Bitcoin.
What I mean by that is that I'm loving the idea but I see a lot of real problems.  One of my concerns is that the complexity of it all will hinder adoption.  
I also have concerns that are perhaps born out of a lack of full understanding.  What happens when BTC mining returns drop significantly lower than costs?  Will transactions fees be sufficient to induce miners to continue participating?
But I'm not forecasting doom for BTC.  I'm cautious.  I don't know enough to say for sure.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:27:15
Well, it's a fact so we have to start our analysis from there.
The art and science of landing page design involves, as it turns out, lots of things that are counter-intuitive.  But I think the main basic principle is that once someone has decided to donate, any complications of any kind causes a significant portion of them to bounce.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:26:15
Ah, well, it isn't a negative to cash out quickly in this kind of case.  As the money is going to a charity (the Wikimedia Foundation) it is standard and boring nonprofit practice to sell immediately.
If someone gives us Google stock, we'd sell it immediately, and that's not because of any opinion of any kind about the future of Google.
Anyway since all this started with people randomly giving me personally BTC (which I didn't ask for and didn't expect!) I am going to wait a few days until things settle down and then cash out all the donations and give it to the Foundation.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:22:39
Exactly. :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:20:59
Yes.  I'm not immune from bad actors and evil people, of course, but I'm also pretty careful.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:32:48
I think it highly unlikely that people would want to be paid in bitcoin.  Indeed, with payroll taxes and other deductions, any deviation from our standard payroll system would be quite annoying for most employees.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:23:25
Our financials are very transparent but if you have specific additional questions, you can ask.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:38:28
It's a well known phenomenon.  Yes, more evidence is always good.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:51:31
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:30:04
QR codes send me running, as well they should, they are robot barf.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:29:45
Yes, that's what I'm thinking would be a fine start.  It would eliminate that whole category of concerns and would give the BTC community a way to donate.
I'll be raising this with the board, but of course it isn't up to me alone.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:18:24
Yes that makes sense.  It's interesting how many people out in the world assumed that the transaction implied I was moving the BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:22:30
And what is your best recommendation on how to do that?  What software do you recommend?  
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:08:36
Well, I think there is significant currency risk.  It is generally considered poor form for nonprofit organizations to hold speculative assets.  If you donate stock to us, for example, we sell it as soon as practical to do so.  This is standard for large nonprofits.
We do hold some foreign currency balances - in currencies where we are likely to transact.  But with BTC, I think for the Wikimedia Foundation, conversion to USD quickly would be the standard policy.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:19:53
Of course not.  You may not know this, but I don't take any salary for my work for Wikipedia, nor do I take any expenses for my work.  That means when there is a board meeting (or Wikimania) and I'm traveling to it, I buy my own plane ticket, pay my own hotel, etc.
I do eat the lunch provided for the board at board meetings.  King Jimbo gots to get something! (ha.)
Also: relax.  Not everything is as corrupt as you fear - or hope.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:50:06
It seems very unlikely to me that total transactions costs would be lower than credit card transactions fees for us with BTC.  Currency conversion alone is not frictionless.
I'd be interested to see a thoughtful analysis of the two, from someone who has experience and understands the real costs of both.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:05:11
Thank you for your kind words.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:30:59
QR-codes are robot barf.  I hate them. :-)
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:33:16
 Just for you ;-)
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:45:25
I speak of the general principle.  It might not hold true for BTC, but I think that's extremely extremely unlikely.  Indeed, BTC is just the sort of highly interesting thing that would distract people a lot.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:12:33
Let's save this for an AMA, but I can give you the tl;dr now.
tl;dr - great school, wonderful friends for life, but high school inevitably sucks for geeks so I hated it to a degree at the time but appreciated it more in due course
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:24:51
I think it would not be wise to put it on the bottom of every page.  In the grand scheme of things the number of people using bitcoin is effectively zero.  So we'd be showing what would effectively be a promotion for bitcoin in exchange for a very small net financial gain.  That'd be great for lots of for-profit bitcoin businesses, and great for the bitcoin movement, but not really sensible for Wikimedia.
Yes, maybe someday if bitcoin becomes mainstream.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:27:07
Well, if my bank gets suspicious I'll find that highly amusing.  They can turn me in to the drug enforcement people or whatever, and it'll all be highly amusing.  Seriously, I'm very very boring. :-)
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:03:03
Yes.  I'm liking coinbase and finding the interface pretty straightforward.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:30:11
No, you can't.  This is me in my personal capacity saying that if you want to give some right now, I'm already planning to sell all that's been given to me so far and donate it to the Foundation.  But that's not really ideal.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:04:23
But there is still a bid/ask spread.  Always.  Yes, BitPay or someone could reimburse by (for example) taking the average of the current market bid/ask when doing the conversion, but that would be actually costly for them, as compared to simply foregoing some fees.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:06:20
Yes.  The need for many donors to have an invoice means adapting our systems, etc.  A lot of people who think "why don't you just add this javascript to your page and be done with it?" are missing that we have big responsibilities.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:46:49
Good resources, thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:36:57
You're welcome.  Thank you as well.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:29:05
Just click the little x when you see it.  It should stay gone.
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:10:44
Funny. :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:16:58
That's ok.  Wikipedia loves you anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:30:24
Thanks for your comments.
Actually, I can't afford to just hire 10 journalists for a year.  Remember, I'm the Wikipedia guy not a Google guy. :)
What kind of sources do you want?  For what?  It doesn't really make any sense - you seem to just want to vent, and hey, that's fine.  But if there is something specific you'd like to see, please explain.
Basically, it comes down to this: if you don't want to support, don't support.  You can still read and participate for free.  Try and relax, nothing about this is hurting you.
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:08:20
Yes and yes.  And thank you. :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 19:48:57
*Well ideally if we get big, we'll be multilingual and in lots of places.  Initially we are launching in English but also looking to hire reporters with strong language skills.  You've given me the idea that if we could only hire 1 bitcoin reporter, it might be kind of awesome to find someone fluent in both English and Chinese.  But we should also look into the costs and possibilities of hiring in China as well.  (Hiring in China is cheaper than in English speaking countries, so...)
Basically I guess the more "big picture" answer to that question is that I'm open and flexible and want to think about how to be highly effective.
*One of the things that I'm interested in is whether the "engaging a community" model that I'm talking about for bitcoin can also work for local journalism.  Let me give an example.  
I was recently in my home state of Alabama and met someone (a journalist) who was telling me about a couple of small local towns where they have 2 newspapers who used to have about 4 journalists each.  Now both papers share 2 journalists who work half-time each on stories in each down.  This has to be devastating in terms of having proper accountability for local corruption, etc.
So, can those communities get together and say hey - let's become monthly supporters of Wikitribune and indicate our interest as our small town?  The two towns have a population of 50,000.  A few thousand supporters could make a big difference.
And here's the thing - because our content will be published under a CC-BY license, we might be able to coordinate with the traditional papers and let them use our content for free.  Why not?  It's paid for by the community, so let's let it go out to the community.
*We're launching in English, but that's just because we have to start somewhere, and that's the language I speak.  I think one way to deal with the bias that may come with that is to look for a broad base of community members to oversee things, but also to think about that issue in terms of hiring (see above for my desire for hiring people with 2nd language skills). 
But I also think it means a lot - not that it is perfect, just that it means a lot - to have a principled dedication to neutrality and a culture of encouraging it and checking ourselves for bias.
*I think community can help, yes.  But yeah, there are no really magical answers to these tough philosophical problems!
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:08:44
There is already independent and high quality journalism in the space - but there could be more.
What I think I can add?  Genuine community control.
And yes, if there is enough support to hire someone to exclusively cover the bitcoin/blockchain beat, then obviously it makes sense to hire someone already well versed, right?  What else would make sense?
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:12:59
Yeah, tipping is very problematic when journalism is concerned.  It's important to design the incentives for journalists that they calmly and rationally follow the facts wherever they may lead.  It's hard enough as it is to do that, without introducing an incentive mechanism that makes it financially joyful to suck up to particular funders.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:24:19
Wow that's very dishonest.  "Lots of donations collected" - from me.  I was the primary funder of the project.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:40:22
Oh, I'm sure!
One of the things I like to do is think about all the advantages of bitcoin in a given context and see if the application really benefits from it.  This is a way to clear ones mind from those who try to razzle dazzle with bitcoin hype.
Would it be a good thing for Wikipedia to pay contributors and reviewers out of ad revenue using a system that would make it quite easy to have direct pay-to-author side deals?  No, actually, it wouldn't.  Doing it via blockchain doesn't really solve any of the actual problems.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:22:54
Good stuff.
@_date: 2017-04-25 23:07:29
Announcing that a service that is normally only offered via traditional currencies is now being offered via bitcoin seems ok to me, eh?
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:36:16
You can't think of a single worse thing for humanity? :-)
Not very imaginative.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:31:13
No, I don't track anything related to blockchain.  I'm not even sure what that would mean in this context, but anyway - no.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:11:10
If by "sounds suspiciously like" you mean "something completely contrary to what was said" then sure.  But unfortunately, words have meanings, and I didn't say - or mean - or suggest - anything like that.
There really is such a thing as neutrality - not everything has to be a battleground.  Coverage of bitcoin can be fact and evidence based, and guess what - sometimes that's going to be positive in some ways, and sometimes that's going to be negative in some ways.  But if we want to make decisions based on the facts of reality, we have to accept that sometimes things go wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:32:45
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:35:02
I'm doing this personally, separately from Wikia.
@_date: 2017-04-30 00:43:36
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:32:24
See my skepticism in another answer about 'tipping' as a model for journalism.  The problem is that it leads to incorrect incentives for authors really, unless handled very carefully.
