What should I do? leave it there for a while? What does that "modify" means? Why can;t i send stonewall after gettting confirmations? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:16:35
stonewall do not work. It's asking me to modify my unspent even though all of them ave more than 6 confirmations.

 I choose richochet. I did not see any coinjoin.. There was only four hops.

Roger ver is a [narcissist]( For him bitcoin is a business, accumulating money and power to feed his grandios trait. He is using libraterian philoshopy as a mask to take over the project . He has not done anything significant to the community. All he has done is spread FUD and invested in bunch of companies around bitcoin to take control over the project.
When he saw bitcoin is decentralized, NO CEO, he registred bitcoin.com and assigned himself as CEO. He did everything possible to take over. When he saw no one really cares about him, he became a politician and used divide and conquer strategy. He started promoting alt coins and last year he even posted on front page of bitcoin.com to go and buy alts and sell btc. Fucking hypocrite. 
All this charde is nothing but his greed of power and narcissistic metal disorder.
Most of the people who are in bcash bandwagon are same like him. All of them wanted to become a CEO. Jihan WU; he wanted to take over.. Faketoshi aka craig wrong... They all wanted to become a figure head, they got hurt when community did not give a shit about them.
They will whine and cry..

This is very exciting. 
With the help of analytics, now the exchanges and financial institutions are black listing users, and addresses. If this thing does not get implemented ASAP, we will lose "permissionlessness"  of bitcoin. Then bitcoin will become like any other commodity controlled by central authority. 
Only draw back is; it requires soft fork. All the mining and exchanges are doing their best to centralise this protocol. They will do their best not to get bulletproof implemented, which they will turn into political event to pump bcash. 
It gives me hope for bitcoin ones again when I see there are dedicated developers working on this project. We love you for keeping it real and keeping it CYPEHRPUNK.. We will support you on this revolution until the end to free the humanity.

To me it feels like we have come to a point where bankers have successfully taken over the bitcoin. Now they are black listing users and addresses. We have lost bitcoin to their "system of control"…
Do you think we should give up bitcoin and go fully Zcash and fight back to destroy bitcoin itself becasue it is now "permissioned" ledger.
I have been involved with bitcoin since 2012 and I feel really bad to see how they took over the project. It was suppose to fight their monopoly, now its part of their monopoly. it was suppose to be cypherpunk revolution but it turned out to be Total global finanacial surveillance system ran by institutional investors.
What are the options left.. this is serious??

Thank you for writing here. I have been following your work closely and you are one of the true Heros of this revolution.
Reading your story gave me goose bumps. Wow !!!
So, when can we roughly expect wasabi to be rolled out? And where else can we see the progress except from the github page?
How can we help? I do not code and I do not think I have bright mind like yours but I am sure there are plenty of people like me who will support bitcoin privacy projects. Let us know.
Stay strong.. world needs you.

From what I understand, Bulletproof encrypts the "send amount" and in combination with coinjoin bitcoin can achieve confidential transaction. 
Are we going to get CT anytime soon? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:26:32
Thats very disappointing. 
What else can be achieved from bulletproofs? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:03:42
Thank you for your reply


Thats how it starts. first this group then another group and then some other group. I am sure you have seen this \[video\] \([ from AA. We can not discriminate. The system has to be work regardless if the person understands the technology or not.
We have come so far with bitcoin.. lets not destroy this system and give it to hands of those. You have ability and power right now.

I hope enough people will see this.
