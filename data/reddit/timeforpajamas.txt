Didn't this happen the first time Bitcoin went to $100? I remember it was at like $30 for a while, and then, oh shit, $100/BTC. Jimmies were rustled. Rick Falkvinge (Pirate Party) was the main guy I was following at the time. Then something about Mt Gox tanked and the price went back to, whatever, $50.
(then later the booms to $200 and subsequently $1000/BTC, and bada bing bada boom here we are today.)

based on my reading of [bitcoin.pdf]( acknowledging the 51% attack amounts to "playing around and waiting." That, or "voting with CPU power."


I'm hearing you identify the falsehood of this foundational assumption. What if honest nodes don't control a majority of CPU power? I agree with you that centralization is happening. I understand and agree that some sort of miner identification would keep miners decentralized.
However, I disagree that this is a feasible solution. Personally, the way I read the paper and through my interactions with the community, the "honest nodes" assumption is not a bug, it's a feature. I believe relying on CPU power is to rely on a free market to determine who cares about Bitcoin, and who's willing to allocate resources to mine.
This is a little shitty, because essentially it amounts to the type of corruption we see with "corporations" controlling America and the world. Why does Hollywood have a stranglehold on copyright legislation? Why are our highways littered with billboard advertisements? Why are all the brands of laundry detergent manufactured by 3 big companies? Because allocation of resources, left unchecked, goes towards an 80-20 distribution of wealth (or 99%-1%) and towards monopolies. I agree that this is messed up. I agree that government should have some regulation in place to limit monopolies and promote competition (a/k/a decentralization).
However, I think people love the free market anarchy of Bitcoin more than they love "Bitcoin" itself. They would rather see Bitcoin crumble than introduce a governing body.
*and at this point, I plead ignorance to Bitcoin politics like Bitcoin Foundation, developers, mining pools, and more. ;-) thank you for the videos. you've taught me a lot about Bitcoin.*
