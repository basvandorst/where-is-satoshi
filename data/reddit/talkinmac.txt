Thankfully I’m not the only one scratching their head on this post.

Nicehash held the coins in their wallets until payout requirements were met. Their wallets were the ones in question that were drained.

Just need to sign a transaction ����.

It would have to be $170,000 for you to have $1,500.

That’s one of Bitfinex’s cold wallets...
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:20:17
So basically their private keys or system holding the keys was exploited...from the outside or within. Some of these recent hacks have me wondering what’s actually going on.

It’s very common to hold 1,000+ BTC in many wallets. Likely part of a larger pot but with as many great opportunities around I’d be surprised if old money DIDN’T start to diversify.

Do you have a screenshot?

It feels imminent doesn’t it? I’m all for a nice dip before the next ATH. I’ll most likely convert all my BTC and rebuy even more on the dip.

Roughly $1700ish...depending

I’ll sell you some via PayPal payment?
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:36:06
Cheers! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:46:20
lol...you’re joking right?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:59:20
Wow. I’d die haha.

They recently dropped PayPal for Adyen...announced this week and sent PayPal’s stock down 15%. It’s real. 
What does Adyen do? Everything PayPal does but with crypto integrations as well. 
...Adyen serves the likes of Uber, Spotify, Netflix and EasyJet to name a few. They’re the real deal. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:00:20
They no longer have Bitcoin integration?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:15:44
They integrate with bitbay though no? For years I thought? It’s late maybe I’m out of it lol. 
...me too! PayPal is married to banks &amp; Wall Street their adoption will be last on the table. Adyen is the future. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:03:55
lol fair enough.

I hate to fault your super awesome logic behind this but what you’re saying is simply not true. Not being able to afford food and working at the same time is reality for many people and I guarantee it’s not their fault. 
I’ve not been able to afford food before while also working non stop. I’ve also had multiple successful startups while earning well into the 6 figures. Shit happens that you end up there it’s not a choice by the person working 40+ hours a week I promise you that. 
So yea OP could get paid daily and it would actually help an entire group of Americans and beyond.

I won’t be able to sleep now.

Is that lettuce...please tell me it’s not lettuce. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 06:01:48
So what do you say to the people who didn’t make the stupid choices you did but find themselves in a similar situation?
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:22:32
Ok that’s bad but not as bad lol.
