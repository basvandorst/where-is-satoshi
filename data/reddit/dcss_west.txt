thats rich coming from the guy who tried to start a serious conversation with a collection of adults about the implications that stem from a lack of cryptocurrency in a computer game about a zombie apocalypse
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:30:29
welcome.  world needs more people who think like you
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:51:45
frankly yes
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:19:17
yes there are some other projects i could see succeeding on various scales and for that reason i am invested in them
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:42:39
for all intents and purposes.  if you want to guess them you are welcome to try though
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:08:04
search this sub for 'hardware wallet', thats what you need

it sure is.  modern hw wallets make the whole process very easy.  there are plenty of things going on behind the scenes that are worth learning about (in my opinion), just so you understand the way transactions work, but you can afford to take your time with that.

steps:  
  
1 - get your wallet's public address, or a qr code for it.  i dont know which make/model you have so i cant help you here, but it should be straight forward.  something along the lines of turn it on/plug it in, open your software, click on 'receive'.    
   
2 - open coinbase on your phone.  go to your accounts, click on your btc wallet, click on the 'send' arrow in the top right.  enter the amount, enter your public address (correctly.  if you mistype it, thats 100% on you, and also irreversable) or scan its qr code (this is what i do.  so much faster and eliminates human error).  hit 'confirm'.  
  
youre done congrats

the thing is, its not a huge spike.  in 20 years when people look back at the charts, the inevitable jump btc made from 10k-16k is going to be so eclipsed by the exponential growth into 7 and 8 figure values that this 'big spike' probably won't even be visible at all on the upslope of the graphs they put in kids' economics textbooks.  but yes, 16k soon
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:48:21
respect.  also, you're being a bit cavalier with your financial details.  how much bitcoin you own is your business bro, keep it that way for good practice.  nobody here needs to know what you've got
@_date: 2019-08-25 06:24:22
oh youre welcome man no worries.  put your bitcoin in a hardware wallet, and consider it on another planet because to would-be thieves it might as well be
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:28:50
what is the point of your account
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:05:28
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:43:49
robinhood is cool for trading but you arent buying bitcoin in the sense that it will ever actually belong to you
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:24:18
however you want?  write them spread out across a few 'random' pages in your favorite book.. hide them in a painting.. memorize them.. write all but 1 or 2 of them down, and just memorize 1 or 2 of them.. use any kind of cipher to hide them via cryptography.. put them in a safe deposit box at a bank..  thats the thing about seed phrases.. its just words.  there is no law that says you have to put it down in order on a piece of paper that says 'this is the password for your bitcoin wallet, dont lose it!!!  dont let anyone find it!!!!!!!!'
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:12:25
i already addressed this in a different comment here.  but i'll reiterate, for the sake of education.  losing a hardware wallet is little more than an inconvenience.  your btc is safe and still under a lock to which only you possess the key.  in the event of a loss/theft, you simply get a new hardware wallet, and restore your lost/'stolen' balance to it using the 24 word seed key that was generated for you when you initially set up your first wallet.  poof, all your bitcoin are back in your hands.  even if someone else steals your hardware wallet, knows what it is, and tries to use it.. unless they know your 8 digit pin code, they cant do anything other than turn it on.

im not the person who posted this.  also theres nothing lame about beautiful women showing off their bodies, personally i fully support that behavior.  i can only assume you are either prepubescent or homosexual?

i use 'simple bitcoin widget' on my phone.  im a resolved hodler but i still enjoy being able to see the price at a glance.  its pretty customizable and it updates every couple minutes, drawing info from a source that you can choose (coinbase gdax binance kraken or any of like 50 other exchanges)
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:23:24
relax man this is a happy place were all makin money its all good remember :)
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:58:53
nothin like that.  my path is not contingent upon bitcoin, i bought the ticket just to ride the ride
@_date: 2019-09-07 21:30:48
makes sense
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:23:27
well played
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:05:37
as far as exchanges go, ive heard coinbase is as safe as they come.  insured, etc.  the thing is, if you have your bitcoin on coinbase, you dont actually own any bitcoin.  for all intents and purposes what you own is a coinbase account with an 'i owe u' number on it.  until you secure those coins into a wallet with a key only you have, you dont actually possess anything.  so if you trust someone else with not only the security of your money, but also trust them to cough up balances at a massive loss if their shit happens to go tits up (google "mt gox" for a historical example of this scenario), thats cool.  i dont, there are alternatives available (ledger) and they are ridiculously easy to use

maybe you should fuck off rofl
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:49:58
factory for sure.  nice btw
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:16:11
this was my first thought as well.
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:04:23
i would say having and maintaining the integrity of your private keys is the qualifier for taking personal responsibility for the safety of your investment
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:06:11
amen.  astonishing to me that there are people who have money in btc and havent spent 50 bucks on a hardware wallet.  personally it was one of the very first things i did, even when i was an absolute beginner to crypto with next to no knowledge and very little skin in the game, it struck me as common sense to spend a relatively small amount of money on the ability to take personal responsibility for the safety of your investment
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:29:24
after doing some meticulous ta i predict we hit 50k this weekend
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:49:06
he's trolling
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:49:14
whoever stole it/finds it cant use it for anything because they dont have my 8 digit pin, and i use the 24 word seed phrase my wallet generated when i set it up to restore my balance to a new hardware wallet
