Yeah. The futures contracts that will be added will allow for institutions to go long and short.
Even though the contracts are cash settled, the introduction of these contracts opens the arbitrage ability until the BTC and spot price match up.

I will tag you in a post when I finally finish it on my laptop. It goes into the potential effects of the new futures coming out. But I'm watching Futurama right now and I'm lazy.

"What goes up must come down"
"past performance is not indicative of future results"
"It works..... until it doesn't"
"This one isn't like the other times." -Said every time.
If you think this price is sustainable, you are more optimistic than I am. And while I believe in blockchain technology in the long run, this is no longer about its inherent technology adoption. This price pump is about buying an incredibly inflated price because you know you can sell it for a higher one. 
That's called building a castle in the clouds. There's no foundation.

Dammit yeah I did

Would be awesome if you could purchase them with crypto. But I didn't see anything 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:04:38
Yeah pretty much

The BTC futures will be cash settled

Well, we're only 10 spots away from it. Instead of $993,000.
Edit: apparently I forgot a word last time

You only lose when you sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:07:41
Thats awesome! How much have you net from the bot?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:05:44
Try it and let me know! The fees are probably what make it non profitable. But arbitrage opportunities are fuckin awesome so might as well
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:56
I did the same as you. But.... sold all of it. Whoops.

Charlie designed LTC to act in tandem with BTC. I believe I'm in the majority who believe the future will have BTC as the store of value while day to day transactions are conducted with Litecoin

This is the definition of arbitrage
