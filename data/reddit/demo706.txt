You clearly have no idea what point I was making, and I don't think you understand this video or you would see it's discussing a different context.
Basically, if you want to tell me that ETH is worth more at .5 BTC when BTC is at $5000 than its worth at .1 BTC when BTC is at $50000 then you are lost.

That's fine that you feel that way but it doesn't change the accuracy of his post. It is still worth an all time high relative to USD. It may not be an all time high compared to BTC, but it is compared to cheeseburgers, gold, or Microsoft stock. Do you see how pointless these distinctions are?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:10:06
For what it's worth, I don't agree with position on this. My point was that the OP chose his unit of comparison as USD and that it is at an all time high. To dispute that by saying its value compared to BTC is low is arbitrary. You could choose limitless different units of value (different coins, securities, currencies, anything) to make different claims about whether it is an all time high by these different units. It would be pointless to do so, as it was pointless to make the distinction about its worth relative to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:41:10
That would be funny but you can tell the other people responding are not joking. They seem to think my pointing out his arbitrary choice to pivot to a different unit of comparison is an insult to BTC.

It's part cultural, part technical. The technical divide is whether increasing block size, the main difference between BTC and BCH, is a long term viable solution for scaling transactions.
The cultural divide is that BCH has marketed themselves as the "true" bitcoin, a laughable claim even if their tech is superior, and they are backed by divisive figureheads (Rover Ver, Craig Wright). BCH, for their part, views BTC as having been "hijacked" and isn't "Satoshi's vision."
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:43:37
Honest question - do you believe that block size expansion is the final solution for scaling issues?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:43:37
lol true
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:17:19
No he doesn't, its worth relative to BTC is arbitrary. He could have just as easily chosen any other coin instead of BTC to compare it to and it would have been equally as arbitrary. He could have chosen ivory as the comparison and it would have been equally as arbitrary.
I love BTC too but come on now.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:13:20
Are you purposefully being dense?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:15:23
I can agree that Bitcoin would be well served bumping up the blocksize to maybe 8MB blocks as a temporary solution (though some say even that size leads to centralization).
I get a lot of different answers from BCH supporters. Some say that it's just temporary and then they will just basically port LN to BCH once the scale is too great for on blockchain transactions (which I find confusing - that's basically admitting that core is right, but that putting the bandaid on is worth the hard fork). I see just as many say that LN is trash and an abomination, which is more confusing because you clearly can't scale on chain transactions to truly large, VISA scale. 
To me, Bitcoin is making a short term mistake by not putting a band aid on the bleeding wound, but I respect their vision in realizing that block size increases will not solve their problems. If growth continues anything close to the rates it has been then even 8 MB blocks will not help within the year.

To be honest, I'm uninterested in who Gavin supports. He believed Craig Wright is Satoshi which shows him to be a naive person at best.
That aside, my point was that he is not a developer. His support doesn't alter the fact that BCH Devs are not largely responsible for the work that they have forked.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:43:58
I think comparing alts against BTC can be useful in that they are most often exchanged for BTC. Comparing them to USD is easier to understand and, generally, more stable, I would agree. 
I guess it would be more accurate not to say that I don't agree with your position, but rather that I was making a different kind of point.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:17:10
As stated, yeah that's a bit silly. But he and bcash devs insult the "core" devs and their work frequently while having forked all of their work and contributed very little of their own.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:55:35
Well Gavin Andresen, to my knowledge, is not an active developer for BCH, and was not one for BTC for a few years now. So bringing him up if your claim is that BCH devs actually made Bitcoin seems strange.
So basically just Jeff Garzik?
Honestly curious, not just trying to be argumentative. I just see Roger Ver and this one BCH dev on twitter always shitting on core devs. If they actually did a lot of work on Bitcoin then sure I'd get with that, but I don't believe that they did.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:30:50
Are you suggesting that he is claiming in this tweet to have started a Bitcoin Cash fork in 2010? He is quite clearly just making a political statement that he believes Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin should be, which has nothing to do with our discussion.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:36:00
I don't think either of those things changes what I said. Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin with relatively minor innovation. All that you've said just means they're insulting themselves and their coworkers.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:36:47
I can understand things and disagree with their accuracy. 
I hope you're right because if bitcoin, or crypto in general, has as much of an impact on the world economy as you believe then I will be incredibly rich. That's just not how I believe it will work.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:32:58
They could hire 1000 people and it wouldn't be done in a day. 
I'm not here to defend Coinbase, I'm just here to call out really shitty comparisons.
This is the thread cryptolution was talking about - 
The comments are full of people shitting on them, rightfully so. No decent QA could have been done, and someone in that topic points out the service they upgraded had performed less than 20 transactions for about 200 users. You can't compare their operation to Coinbase. It's not in the same realm. The comparison was total garbage.

This is ridiculous. If I want to buy a house and I don't have all the money to buy it in whatever deflationary currency...guess what I would need? A loan.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:46:23
This kind of hub and spoke design is similar to how the internet functions today, except that you will have more choices than your local ISP on what hub to connect to. The concern about centralization is overblown.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:04:55
I doubt the team that upgraded their systems in a single day with 3 engineers is anything close to the scale of Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:58:42
There is a spectrum of centralization. Full peer to peer mesh is as decentralized as possible but not feasible in some cases, ie the internet. A hub and spoke configuration is not fully decentralized but it is not centralized either.

You think Bitcoin is going to make house values crash now? What are you talking about dude?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:25:59
You have an incredibly bizarre understanding of the world economy for one thing, and your speculation about house prices is an unrelated tangent to the necessity of loans. Even if house prices somehow get to the point that they are affordable in a lump sum for most individuals, which they will not, to entertain the idea that loans will be unnecessary because of a deflationary economy is insanity. Our understandings of the economy are clearly extremely different and would take far too long to unravel, so I'll just say have a good day.

And why is that "healthy?"
The point I'm getting at is that there's nothing inherently "healthy" or "unhealthy" about these market forces. They merely are.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:35:25
I have never understood the view that a small price pull back is "healthy" for the market. What makes it more "healthy" than if the price just increased at a slower rate in the first place?
I'm not saying I think Bitcoin should just go up constantly or anything, but people always forecast a "healthy" pull back or justify it like this after it has happened.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:37:25
For certain things private blockchains will make lots of sense, if it's just internal tracking of some data that a company wants. For some purposes, a huge part of the benefit of blockchain is that it's a public ledger. The largest and most secure public ledger is Bitcoin. I wouldn't personally make the argument that Bitcoin will take over everything - it will have its particular uses that it will be very good at, but it's very unlikely in my mind that Bitcoin will maintain its stranglehold on the use of blockchain technology. However, to say that Bitcoin will completely fall by the wayside in favor of - of all things - government issued crypto shows a misunderstanding of the purpose of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:58:58
There really isn't a difference.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:03:37
Everything is super obvious in hindsight. Without knowing what went into your decision you may as well have flipped a coin, hit heads, and said afterwards it was super obvious it would be heads. Or for that matter even if you called it beforehand it's still random chance.
You may have made the decision for the wrong reasons and ended up right. Claiming that anything about the price fluctuation of Bitcoin is obvious makes me think this is most likely the case.
