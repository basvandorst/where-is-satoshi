So they can't account for all of the cash purchases/investors... Could be more like 2.5m no one knows... 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:12:40
How could anyone possibly know that?

As far as I can tell Multibit doesn't allow you to set the fees, I'm currently in the process of "reset block-chain and transactions" in multibit, at the moment its 47 percent. Could this help?
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:12:58
Yes sell! Bring on the 3 page rants about how bitcoin went to high to soon. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:25:22
You honestly dont think people highly invested in BTC have limit sell orders in place to automatically sell at their desired price point?

It's important to truly understand somethings value before you take out a loan to invest in it. You take out a loan that you can't afford to buy something that is over valued and you're going to get burned. The banks are happy to take stupid peoples money no doubt about that. Some banks got greedy which is what led to housing crisis occurring between 2007-2010, which ultimately contributed to the U.S. recession of December 2007 – June 2009. Those select bank's should have been left to fail imo. But this isn't convincing me that blockchain is the 2nd coming of Christ...

Okay but can you explain how they're going to replace bank loans with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:02:05
Can someone explain to me how blockchain will replace loans and mortgages?

I'm going to repost with a more refined title and description.

It's call objectivism...

Finally a relative comment.  I can finally go to bed now that I know this isn't a parallel universe of the Donald sub...

Okay can you loan me 0.22442 Bitcoin? You can deposit it right into my Bitcoin wallet 136ZNpfEixrvevbkJVvCrs94G2z9VzUapt and I'm going to pay you back because that's how loans work now...

You were either born rich or your going to die poor with that "don't spend money you don't have" attitude friend. Bank's are the only ones who are going to loan you money to open a business (assuming you have a solid business plan). They want you to pay off your debt so they can collect maximum profits from you.

I don't have any friends with the capital to lend me 300k to buy a house, or 1.2 million to open a restaurant unfortunately... If everyone knew someone with that kind of capital we wouldn't need banks, sure, but these aren't solution to a bank loans... 
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:36:15
 I understand what it's suppose to be replacing, I just don't understand how.
Without fractional reserve banking in this country (America) the average person wouldn't be able to get a loan.... Imagine if you took away 90% of the loans in America.

You're referring to inflation. People are making more money today than ever, blame the people who are able to afford the higher prices... Everything is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it... And I'm all for a solution to make things affordable for everyone, but right now the only solution to buy something you can't afford is a bank loan imo.... I don't see where blockchain remedies this, that's not to say I came here with my mind made up, I would love to leave with an understanding that changes this... 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:01:54
(I edited my original comment)
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:48:55
And blockchain is going to replace loans and destroy banks how???
 


I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:05:30
I understand smart contracts but I don't see how they can replace a bank loan. Most people would lose their home within a year... 
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:49:40
Seriously? Did you even read my original question "Can someone explain to me how blockchain will replace loans?"? My currency could be gold, or bitcoin for all you know... I want to know why people think blockchain is going to replace the tradition banking system specifically loans. Can you explain this to me? If not then please step aside... 
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:21:44
I do not disagree with that statement sir. Extremely wrong about what?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:47:41
I dont think anyone is understanding the question of why and how
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:59:46
To buy an investment or rental property? Open a business? Generate wealth?
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:30:30
I can't with this guy...
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:27:42
Are these bots? Changing the way you think maybe. We need loans dude... I'm not talking about talking about taking a loan to invest in a fucking speed boat here, I'm talking about loans used for investing to develop wealth. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:18:57
I was only attempting to keep my reply relative to your comment, and I never said anything about bitcoin. Your first comment didn't even take my original question into consideration... In no way does Bitcoin allow people to 'be their own bank' it is simply a storage of value, albeit one of the best we have imo. Bitcoin allows us to cut out the banking system from a standard transaction, but it isn't cutting out "the middleman". 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:55:26
Your still going to a BANK. If you miss a payment they're likely going to work with you as they want to maximize profits.
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:37:24
I like that answer. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:57:33
Will someone please tell me what "Bitcoub's" are?
