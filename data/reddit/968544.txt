im buying and selling on gdax, not transferring, maybe same issue? but 1 of mine has gone through, and my other trades today went through no problem. It was only after the crash when my money froze

Anyone else experiencing this issue? i have just sent an email to gdax but i doubt i will hear anything from them in a timely mannor.

is this a stop loss?
current price is 10,000
i put stop loss at 9975
when price hits 9975, i automatically sell at market price

He says 500 bits is .00005 in his post. That’s $0.50
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:29:55
500 bits is only $0.50
5000 bits would be $5

He’s reading the business paper in 2019. It says bitcoin 75k

That’s because everyone already uses euro and dollar, you don’t need to advertise..... pretty common sense.
Everyone has heard of Coca Cola, yet there’s tons of ads so you can BUY MORE. Are you 12?

Sometimes $2 is better than no dollars. Only thing stopping me from using the atm is the fees. If it was reasonable i would use it.

I did this while selling my 13k motorcycle. I ended up with cash and used it to buy bitcoin. No one wanted to use bitcoin because they dont know anything about it.
