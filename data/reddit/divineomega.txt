I do understand what you mean. You are saying, in the future, you may want to recover from a seed using a program that (theoretically) may not exist anymore.
I've had the same concerns before. I'm quite confident, since we're getting standard ways for these deterministic wallets to be generated, that in the near future there'll be many different programs that can recover from the same format seed.

As someone who has developed Android apps before, it is slightly more complex than just the Google account getting compromised.
To update an Android app, you have to digitally sign the new version of the app with the same key used for previous versions. This means the both the Google Account and this signed key would need to be compromised to allow for an unofficial update to be released. If the keys do not match, Android devices will refuse to install the update.
I'd say this is why you don't hear about that happening often.
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:22:22
Wild insane conspiracy theory: A large double spend as a result of a 51% attack was planned to occur on Overstock.com just after they start accepting Bitcoin, in a malicious attempt to discredit Bitcoin.
I doubt that is in any way true, but the timing of these two big events could be deemed suspiciously close by some.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:59:09
Exactly. Multibit appears to be getting a lot of grief for something it does not do - create change addresses.

@_date: 2016-03-03 09:12:13
I would have liked to do so, but I thought there were two problems with this.
1. As says, it would be difficult to separate regular donations from donations intended for the game. I didn't want to have a fixed amount, as I wanted people to be able to donate as much or as little as they wanted.
2. I didn't want the charities to deal with the inherent issues of dealing with large quantities of same values. Large numbers of inputs tend to result in large mining fees. Sending them in bulk amounts every so often should help mitigate this.
Thanks for the feedback. :)
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:39:28
Hey there. Sorry you feel like like that. I'm actually intending to give the vast majority of the bitcoins received to charity. :)

Hi all,
I'm the creator of this. I was inspired by seeing  and the idea of remotely controlling devices with bitcoin micro-payments.
You can send any amounts you wish to the various controls and you'll see the result a few seconds later (it actually happens near instantly, but there's a live streaming delay). I intend to give the majority of the funds received away to bitcoin accepting charities. Not yet confirmed which, possible Seans Outpost and/or The Water Project. If anyone has got suggestions for charities, I'd love to hear them.
If you've got any question regarding this project, please ask!
@_date: 2016-03-03 09:06:59
Sounds interesting. The implementation currently uses the bitcoinj library to monitor addresses. I've not had any experience coding payment channel solutions, but it's certainly sometime I'll have to look into.
Thanks for the feedback. :)
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:31:21

Regarding the bitcoins themselves, I intend to give out the vast majority of any money received to bitcoin accepting charities.
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:31:30
Thanks. I've tried to keep the default value (provided by the QR codes) high enough to not generate horribly small outputs, but people are free to send whatever amount they want. The game will respond to any amount sent, as long as it gets relayed through the network.
Thanks for feedback! :)

Or am I optimistically misunderstanding?

Shame, but still very cool to see some progression in this area.
Many thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2012-01-13 18:51:35
I completely agree with the error handling, and that is definitely going to be in the next version. Perhaps it will be simple as the function returning false or a -1 (or various negative integer error codes) if it is unable to process due to a failure to retrieve the JSON content (or in the case that the retrieved JSON is invalid.
Class names beginning with capitals is a convention I've always used in Java, but I have never heard of a specifically recommended naming convention for PHP classes, but fair enough.


I have never heard of this, is it a convention/style remark or is does it have performance benefits due to how PHP handles strings and/or concatenation? I'm quite curious. 
@_date: 2012-07-20 08:45:10
Good article, but I think explaining this to new Bitcoin users would just confused matter. I think new users need more analogies to fiat currency, something known and used daily.

@_date: 2012-01-13 18:58:37
Don't worry about it too much. 
It was really quick bit of 0.1 version code, and it took me longer to write about it on the site than it did to create and test. However, I'll definitely look to improve some elements of it, and add new features that could be useful.
Knowingly releasing it without error handling for the external source networking code is actually really bothering me now. I'll likely fix it this weekend.
@_date: 2012-05-29 21:17:29
This look cool, but I've not heard much about it. Where can I buy this in Bitcoins?

@_date: 2012-07-20 21:36:33
I only suggest it in this situation because the concept being explained here is particularly foreign from what most people are used to understanding about how currency transfer works. 
Otherwise yes, I agree we should definitely differentiate Bitcoin from fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2012-09-24 22:54:52
Just to make people aware, this is not a new vulnerability. Waiting for sufficient confirmations alleviates all of this.

@_date: 2011-06-06 22:28:44
Correct. The coins are stored in the network (in the block chain). The wallet simple stores the relevant data to access the coins which are yours.
If I'm wrong, someone please feel free to correct me.

Thanks. That was the exact idea.
I'm quite experienced with Bitcoin, but I find that a lot of 'intro to Bitcoin' style articles jump into cryptography and the details of how Bitcoin works, rather than just what it is. I was hoping this (heavily) simplified explanation may be useful for people to those initially looking up the subject, without being heavy on the technical aspects and hoping not being too inaccurate.

Quite a few here: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:31:08
I can't vouch for the WooCommerce WordPress plugin, but the API is very simple to integrate if you have familiarity with any other fiat currency payment gateway systems, such as SagePay. 
Their support staff are also very helpful. My only slight niggle is that you currently have to request refunds via email and they are processed manually - although, to be honest, I'm not sure how that could be done (safely) in any other way.

Thanks for the apostrophe catch. I'm usually red hot on apostrophe usage, as it is really annoys me when I see them used incorrectly.


I've probably given the impression that I'm not very experienced with Bitcoin by writing that with no context. I'd like to say I am pretty experienced, and I agree the article is nothing new per say. However, I wanted to try to write an article that avoiding the technicalities of how Bitcoin works, while still explaining what it is. 
The audience is those who are only mildly curious about subject and do not necessarily wish to understand the cryptography behind how Bitcoin functions. In retrospect, is more a group of intermediate to expert Bitcoin users, so possibly not the best place to post it.


Yes, this is my address, and I have no problems with this address not being anonymous. I have multiple separate wallets for anonymity if/when required.

I think a reasonable number of GPU miners will leave Bitcoin mining (all together or for an alt. coin). This will cause block confirmations to briefly become slower than the standard 10 minutes for a while, until a larger number of ASICs are out there to compensate.

I thought this was going to be another story to someone stealing your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:16:51
Brilliant! Thank you.

I have to know the story behind your username.

I just sent them an email stating that I heard takeaway.com now accepted Bitcoin and asking if they had any plans to accept it. 
@_date: 2013-02-01 23:58:53
I actually made something specifically to do this.
Example code (this is for GBP, but can easily be changed to USD):
    include "bitcoin_helper.php";
    $bh = new bitcoin_helper;
    echo $bh-&gt;convert_to_btc("GBP", 10);
Link: 
It makes use of bitcoincharts.com weighted price data. 
Edit: note, this isn't actually an API in itself, but a library/class that makes use of bitcoincharts.com JSON API.

Do you know if these guys are open on Sundays? I was thinking of heading there tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:58:21
What client is that?
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:12:53
Glad to help. :)

This video cuts off before the interview is over. :/
Do you know if there is a more complete version? I can't seem to find one.

Regarding 'chain block', I noticed he stumbled slightly after saying it, which suggests he may have realised his mistake. My opinion is that perhaps he did not wish to make a big deal of a slight mistake in a technicality of how Bitcoin functions.
Not everyone who uses cash necessarily knows what the word ledger means precisely.

I'm also interested in UK support.
Have you had any thoughts on expanding to other fast food restaurants at all?
@_date: 2013-11-10 11:51:41
Do you have plans to support UK merchants?

How about these:  ?

The regulator was surprisingly positive.
@_date: 2013-09-15 11:27:23
I wish a UK based company would start doing this. 
@_date: 2013-08-14 08:08:56
Apparently I should expect my order some time next month.
