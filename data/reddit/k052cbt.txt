Do you guys think KYC rules will ever lessen? I feel like it's a big barrier for new people coming into the space. Imagine someone giving up their SSN, address, and picture of themselves to an exchange website they've never heard of before. Uniter States by the way
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:44:36
Ok I meant taking a picture of ur drivers license or passport
@_date: 2019-08-19 20:52:13
I feel like this is one of, if not the biggest barrier to adoption of cryptocurrency. We live in a world where the government has complete control over us and decide what the rules are.

Question: if I buy bitcoin and want to give it away/ buy something with it like coffee or a video game, do I need to keep a record for tax purposes?
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:52:02
What a rat
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:43:19
hah.. if we truly lived in a democracy.. everyone knows that there's very very very rich people behind the scenes controlling everything

Does Bitcoin mining use that much electricity? I feel like this is a point that Critics always use. Can't this problem be resolved by renewable energy like solar panel and windmills?
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:06:18
Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin should not be taxed at all. What service is the government providing to us that gives them the right to take a cut of our Bitcoin gains?
We already contribute to society on income tax and sales tax. The government doesn't have a right to be involved in investments.

Someone who finally gets it thanks. Other people commenting are government cucks

I'm just worried if I decide to buy 100$ of Bitcoin today and spend it and having that transaction haunt me back later once bitcoin reaches 100k or so.

We might not get an ETF for 20 years. The boomers in office  are stubborn. We need them to die out and millennials in office.

What Happened Gol D Roger's gold from One piece died?
@_date: 2019-10-04 23:15:19
If fiat collapse, Gold won't be used as a currency, it's not divisible and inconvenient. We live in a digital era of information. If Bitcoin can somehow be simplified it will go mainstream. Alt coins may be faster than bitcoin but they do not have the users or security.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:48:20
There will come a time where you won't need to convert Bitcoin to anything, because Bitcoin is already money itself.
@_date: 2019-10-07 16:19:04
What bank is this? Call them out

This is why capital gains tax are a scam:
If you buy one Bitcoin for $5000 and sell it for $10000,
After taxes you wouldn't be able to buy back the same exact Bitcoin you just sold.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:00:35
You buy one BTC for 5k and sell it for 10k,  now you have 7k after taxes and you use it to buy BTC again, but it can only buy you 0.7 BTC when you originally had 1 BTC. You lost money.
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:42:25
I always saw Gold as jewlery and not really a form of money. I think the only people praising gold are the boomers as it was precious in the old days. I don't know any other millenial values gold. It's just a shiny rock that has no use other then comestics. Information and technology are far more important for us.

im not spending my whole entire portfolio?? i'm taking spare change from my cash converting it to btc and making a purchase. why do you even fucking care lol
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:56:08
my fun consist of occasionally eating out and playing league of legends (free game)
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:53:39
Alt-coins are merely tools to accumulate more bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:32:21
It's really hard to leave the place where I grew up with all my family and friends to move to somewhere alone with nobody I know. It's a harsh reality but I am considering it to attain more wealth.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:16:55
Like what if I bought and hodl for my non tech savvy parents?
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:34:38
While all my graduated friends from high school are traveling the world and enjoying their lives partying, I'm just staying working/penny pinching and going home every weekend for the last 2 years so i can invest in bitcoin. Am i doing it right? I hope this will pay out in the end :)

Stay at home wife being the boss what the hell

Bitcoin won't go anywhere under these KYC laws. I want to get some Bitcoin to buy nudes from a camgirl but there's no exchanges that don't require KYC. I don't want to purchase 25$ and be questioned by the IRS where that 25$ went if it turned into $1000 etc. Government regulation is absurd
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:17:30
So is it official that Bitcoin's use case as a currency is dead? It seems that Bitcoin's purpose is to be a store of value. I feel like there are too many tax restrictions that prohibit from bitcoin flourishing as a currency. I can't imagine keeping track of any micro-transaction to report to the damn IRS at the end of every year.
As for currency transactions, I think alt-coins may be more suitable but no alt-coin will ever take bitcoin's place as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:50:44
my fucking bad for wanting to actually transact with it. you can fuck off retard
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:44:17
Everyone thinks it as simple as just working and saving money. But not everyone wants to retire at 70... The boomer generation was able to purchase real estate and stocks at mouth-watering prices. Today's millennials are screwed in my opinion. How the hell are we suppose to get 200k for a downpayment on a house?
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:51:54
What's your salary though?
Have kids or wife?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:06:21
thank you good sir
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:41:32
Hate to mention the L word but maybe Libra would be our go to cryptocurrency? it might not incur capital gains tax due to being already pegged 1:1 US dollar. Or Maybe even Dai
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:53:05
 I hard agree that California is becoming socialistic. Taxes are crushing the middle class into oblivion.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:58:27
Its ok man I literally bought at 9500 too.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:19:27
Lmao my paycheck already got hit by income tax and the Gov wants to hit it again for me simply wanting bitcoin hahaha, truly corrupt society
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:48:55
Heh hopefully my heirs will be able to create a dynasty with that wealth.

Where did you move good sir? I am considering Texas, Nevada, or New York in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:58:44
buy buy buy MOTHERFUCKERS, DON'T LET THE WHALES BUY BACK AT A LOWER PRICE
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:48:25
What's your cost of living though?
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:30:25
Allow me to elaborate, all situations suck. If you want a home, go to graduate school to get higher income, BUT you'll be enslaved to student debt for your whole youth.
If you don't take on massive debt to try to invest in yourself, you'll be a renter for your whole life. 
I think both scenarios are screwed up. Life is meant to be enjoyed. I think the working culture in America is screwed. I believe we only get 2 weeks of vacation a year where EU countries get months? Correct me if im wrong.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:46:52
The question is to where shall I move..
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:48:04
It's pretty good if there's room for job promotions. But my field is very selective and jobs are hard to come by
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:00:32
Are there any laws against someone giving me money to buy bitcoin on their behalf using my coinbase account?
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:41:43
We can thank the government for this barrier :)
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:37:05
Cost of living is at an ALL TIME HIGH due to mismanagement of government and unlimited currency printing whereas wages have remain stagnant. The only people in California able to afford homes right now are people who come from a Rich family, successful entrepreneurs, or people who took massive debt to enroll in graduate school.
The market is oversaturated with Bachelor degrees now and employers are not motivated to pay employees wages to keep up with the cost of living.
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:52:05
Would Bitcoin do better under a Republican or Democratic government?
Let's be honest, Donald Trump pumped the hell out of the S&amp;P 500 and we saw some of that money flow into Crypto.
