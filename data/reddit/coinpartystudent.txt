We only use 1-to-1 transactions, where the second-part transactions (from the temporary escrow addresses to the shuffled output addresses) are executed randomly within a certain time window in order to break the linkability that, e.g., large CoinJoin transactions suffer from.

Indeed, we stumbled across this pitfall. However, there is nothing wrong with letting the users submit another unencrypted "backup address" that is being used instead of trying to find the original "from address" if an error is detected. If the protocol has to abort for any reason, the requirement of anonymity can be discarded.

Yes, there is. It was the task of my master thesis. Unfortunately, we are not ready to release it yet. And even if we do, work must be put into it to make it a production-grade level project.

We did not yet release our code. During my master thesis, I rewrote the initial prototype mentioned in our [comment]( to make it a usable system. However, it is not very polished and in some regards that are important to a production-grade piece of software, but not to the proof of concept and general usability that we wanted to achieve with my thesis. Hence, even when we release our code, some work must be put into it before it is securely usable in a real-world setting.

That's what we're hoping for. :-)
