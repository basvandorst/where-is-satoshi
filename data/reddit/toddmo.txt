Well, FUD over one isolated incident at coinbase might be totally wrong, but overall, the FUD about keeping bitcoin keys online seems justified, don't you think? I moved it to blockchain.info because at that point I didn't know how to do cold storage. I'm learning about that now. Thinking of doing just a brain wallet actually.

People who say bitcoin is a bubble are **reacting to the price** vs. **doing analysis on the value**. They are not doing any analysis on the value. None of them is doing analysis, using that analysis to calculate what the price should be, then comparing it to the current price. They are just looking at P, P', or P'' and making an absent-minded judgement.
So, they are a trailing phenomenon, not a leading phenomenon. What they say has no predictive value.
Or, they are the enemies of bitcoin. Either way, they will never say "Ok, I give up"

**Free access to bank account transfers** and **free limit orders** for day trading, that's why. I'm a member of every other major US exchange but none do just what GDAX does. I don't know why either. Huge business opportunity for them.

When another exchange besides GDAX offers free limit trading, I'll happily move, if there's sufficient trading volume.
My point is, with all the dissatisfaction, there's an untapped business opportunity for another exchange to offer free limit trading with better customer service and segwit.

So, even though I'm not thrilled, the current tax situation is far from some slaughterhouse that bitcoin users will not survive.

What if nicehash gets hacked again? Their books aren't worth shit.
What if the bitcoins coinbase thinks are there end up not being there?
This is like trading certificates of deposit.
Also, since these aren't cleared by a fool proof mechanism, the funds can show up in two places at once, which happens all over the place in our current fiat system with all kinds of assets. It lays the groundwork for coinbase to become insolvant.
I'm surprised the regulators allowed this.

If Wall Street keeps screwing with bitcoin, or a derivative, that would help ensure that survival. What is attractive to common people is attractive even more to the wealthy because their wealth multiplier is so much greater on any given opportunity.
I think only the central bankers themselves are set to object unconditionally. Even the big banks are investment houses now. If they start making more money from bitcoin then by lending, they will depend on it.

Hmmm. I don't know about the wisdom of giving them actual money. Money equals power. I think all they deserve is depreciating legacy debtor's notes. They are our enemies, after all. Plus, if they give them fiat, they'll have more fiat to give them later. Big oil doesn't give them land rights. Big pharma doesn't give them patent rights. We should follow the lead of the experienced lobbyists. Don't share the power base. Use the power base to get even more power.

I meant up *and* down, both. It's not about a dip; my comment is about spot traders using the futures as an indication of where the spot price needs to be. Which is bass-ackwards. My "gibberish" is about the spot price getting "pegged" to the futures price, still, today, right now. Why isn't spot 20k? Because a bunch of diddle heads think the futures market is some indication? Oh boy. Why in the hell would **our** confidence *ever* depend on **their** confidence? That's insanity!
Futures trails spot, shouldn't be influencing spot. They over there at CME have no more idea than we do about what the price "should be" in the months to come. Worse, half of them are big bears. Wall street has a very different idea about how prices work. They think this thing is just another stock! And half think it's in a bubble! Half think it has 0 value. Worse, the CME makes just as much money if the futures ping pong between 18 and 19k forever. They could care less. And we can count on MSM to be absolutely as unhelpful as they can possibly be, spreading FUD and conflating spot and futures.
Are we, who understand the technology, going to let a bunch of shit heads on wall street tell us what bitcoin price needs to be? Because in the long run, price and adoption level are intimately tied. It's probably not an existential crisis but a lot is at stake here in terms of moon schedule and hence adoption rate. (those 2 things are in a feedback cycle)
So, remind yourself to let me know when the spot breaks free from (stops trailing) the futures price. because then your point will be valid and I'm telling you, I'll be glad to be wrong then. Trust me I will. I hope the critical mass realizes the CME is a side show, sports betting, irrelevant to the future of bitcoin (other than to lend it credibility).

Bitcoin is based on some type of game theory. But I'm not a GT expert. Maybe Satoshi was. But it seems reminiscent of giving a pie to two children, and letting one child cut it and the other child take the biggest piece. It's a trust-less but fair system.
Someone should write a book on trust-less system engineering. Because that is absolutely fascinating. Another example is the lines at the store or the bank. They even out in a fair way with no policing or trust required, as per self interest.
Bitcoin's value is the vacation from trust. Humans are intrinsically untrusting of strangers. Trust in strangers causes anxiety. Bitcoin reduces anxiety. This is universally and eternally true. Fedcoin won't change that aspect. Thus bitcoin is also emotional.

Satoshi is a crackpot?
Just this year, the Fed opened a completely new section devoted to blockchain research. This was in Powell's congressional testimony. He said, they are very interested in blockchain. What I'm saying in my post is that they are also very scared of doing it themselves, esp. as a public facing coin for the public.

In a move that may seem counter-intuitive, central banks are going to go to war with big banks:
This explains why the Fed says "bitcoin bad, blockchain good". It explains why Jamie Dimon hates bitcoin. Watch. You will never see the Fed make a public statement that contradicts this theory (of a war on big banks). By "War", all they really have to do is wait for the big banks to fail again, and simply fail to bail them out. In order NOT to fail, the big banks may buy huge quantities of bitcoin; remains to be seen. But seems like that might shore up and balance the books. However, the Fed needs to fully develop, test and deploy the FedCoin before it's ready for the big banks to fail and go away. When they do that, they will outlaw bitcoin. But, as per game theory, bitcoin may be legalized again if somehow (yet to be determined exactly how) FedCoin fails.
I don't know how this fits into my question, except that a huge layer of corruption will be removed by the central banks (biggest criminals) to eliminate the middle men (big banks), the big criminals. Fiat will be all digital aka FedCoin.

No they won't be biased when they are earnestly trying to talk to one another across central banks or within the same central bank. The trick is catching those "real" communications. You really have to read every piece between the lines and deduce the shadow that the truth leaves on whatever they say. We know they are concerned. We also know they haven't issued FedCoin yet, nor have they outlawed bitcoin. You take whatever truth you know and use it to help you do the "shadow projection". It's an art, not a science. But the more you deal with sussing out the truth, the better you get at it.
They have mostly been leaving the FUD to the MSM and their guest "expert" speakers, who they secretly assign and pay to issue all the hit pieces.

people just need time to get used to the new price and for it to seem normal, then it goes up again.
Once it crosses *X* k, it bounces around in k - 1, but k - 2 seems like a bargain so it doesn't ever go hang out at k - 2 again for more than a few seconds. It just gradually goes up until k + 1 becomes the new k and the process repeats itself.

No it can't. You can only arbitrage in the same item, like if two exchanges show the same thing at two different prices.
But bitcoin is bitcoin and futures contracts are USD settled.
So, this notion is false. You can't buy some bitcoin and take it into the CME and use it for anything. You can't exit the CME with bitcoin and use it to close a position in the spot market. They give you just fiat.
Said another way, arbitrage is only possible when two markets share a common item that is portable between them. Bitcoin is not allowed to cross the crypto / CME boundary.

Ah. Well, as we see, fiat is valued less and less even in the absence of bitcoin. But enter bitcoin and that accelerates. Eventually, bitcoin holds **all** the value and fiat holds none. In the final days, the exchange rate will be so high and changing so fast it will become essentially meaningless.
We know the price (exchange rate) but we can only approximate the value. But it's related to the adoption level.
If A is the adoption level and P is the price, then A^new = A * P * constant1 and P^new = A * P * constant2. Some positive constants. It's a feedback loop. Note, the adoption level is a percent, and it isn't just the number of people holding *any* bitcoins, but the sum of all holders % of assets in bitcoin / number of people.

"Bitcoin was the first automated ratchet-action noose-tightening one-way inevitable irresistible money bomb mind bomb meme reinforced global power acquisition system (RANTOWIIMBMBMRGPAS). Being tireless, working night and day, as it was a machine, it easily out-maneuvered even the Rothchilds (see previous chapter), captivating the minds of the entire planet and acquiring the world's wealth in what seems now like a breathtakingly short period of time - 20 ancient Earth years, with 98% of the money of Earth being gobbled up in the last year - 2029. When the algorithm completed, nothing existed that was incompatible with it. Although it saved Earth's inhabitants from much misery, including global warming, it did cause the first cases of hypermemeatoxia, as some of these more primitive humans were simply too underdeveloped to be able to think any longer of anything other than bitcoin, and forgot to breathe."

DO NOT FREAK OUT. HOLD.
Futures Index trading is only in dollars, and not connected to the actual bitcoin price by any mechanism whatsoever. Only FUD can make the bitcoin price go down. The MSM is probably going to try very hard to conflate the futures with the price of bitcoin; they may start reporting on the futures prices and stop reporting on the actual bitcoin price.
Do not let any of that fool you. They want to "tame" bitcoin with FUD and make all the money over at the commodities exchange and stop the bitcoin rocket. But I say they can't and it will fail. Educate as many people as you can that the futures is not connected to bitcoin; it's a sideshow for wall street only.

Ok so this means that the futures will never be above the (spot price + the time value of money). The futures are pegged to the spot in this way. The spot as defined by the index, of course. But the OP was asking how can the futures control the spot. 
In the apple example and with bitcoins, arbitrage can go into the spot market and buys items repeatedly until the spot price comes up to within (the futures price - time value of money). This drives the spot market up.
However, if the spot price is equal or above the futures price, arbitrage **cannot borrow bitcoins** so they can hold those for a year, like they could with apples (yes, magic apples that don't rot; think of grain then). No one has any bitcoins laying around available to lend. To drive this point home, when they settle, they aren't given bitcoins that they can use to pay back the bitcoins they borrowed.
So, in summary, **futures arbitrage could pull the spot market up, but it can't pull it down**, which is what the OP was afraid of.

Value isn't price. Price of fiat is over-cooked, I think.
If there's nothing left to convert bitcoin to, then there wouldn't be a conversion rate. 
As inflation and QE continue, (which is the price to go into a conversion rate like the bitcoin "price"), at the same time the fiat will be de-valuing vis a vis bitcoin (a de-valuation effect *seperate* from inflation and QE), as people value bitcoin more and more. So everyone will demand more and more fiat in exchange for bitcoin.
Finally, as the value of fiat approaches zero, the "price" (the conversion rate) of bitcoin will approach infinity. Bitcoin will get you near infinite fiat, but that fiat won't be worth much.
Fortunately, the bitcoin will be worth **alot**, in **value**, in what it can buy in the real world. 
Someone who owns 1 bitcoin will own 1 / 21 millionth of the world's entire wealth. That is a shit load of wealth.
Whew. Now to actually answer your question:
With the banksters out from around our necks, the economy will grow like never before. So yes the **value** of bitcoin will be the **value** of the world economy, which will take off like a rocket, not be a bubble, and we'll never have another recession or depression again!

Fascinating. 
I can see how bitcoin millionaires would pay off their loans, thus causing dollars to be destroyed, and moreover no longer have need to take out any new loans, and loans are what makes the fiat economy "go". *I would still need to figure out what happens to the late adopters.*
The early adopters might take out loans in the period of bitcoin price inflation, to buy more bitcoin. But if the price leveled off this would stop. 
By Their's Law, people would hand over "worth less" fiat for taxes and obligations, and sellers of valuable things would insist on receiving bitcoin only. This would push up the price even more. It's already begun on Craigslist.
We might need to elaborate about how this makes fiat worthless in everyday life.

That's actually a great idea, replacing the fan. The S9s have to be electrically connected to the factory fan or they won't run. So that's an electronics and possible warrenty issue, but probably solvable.
I found out that several layers of towels might be the best / cheapest option to sound proof. I ordered a sound meter. When that comes in, I have a VERY noisy hair dryer I can experiment on. 
Also, if I stack them where the dryer WAS, then stack my dryer on top of my washer, they can all use the dryer exhaust port to export all the heat right out of the apartment! They will be sucking air conditioned air.
Still doing research, but maybe I can wrap each S9 in 5,345 towels each, then enclose the miner rack in a box which is lined with 72,316 more towels, maybe they will be bearable.
And, if I locate my wifi router there, and run a 15m cat6 cable to it from my modem, they can all get ethernet 1Gb connectivity (instead of wifi).

My goal is to accumulate bitcoin, not fiat. And one day live in a world where bitcoin acceptance is ubiquitous. And then, key distinction, I'll convert some to fiat *only as a last resort*, not because *that was the objective all along*.
From my point of view, the difference manifests itself in the distinction between "sell high buy low" bitcoin trading pairs, which increase the holder's bitcoin, and "buy low sell high" bitcoin trading pairs, which increase the holder's fiat. There are other ways to accumulate bitcoin, obviously. What you value is what you end up with after your activities, be they trading or anything else.

FUD is something done on purpose. So newbs can't do that. They don't know enough to cause FUD.
FUD is done by enemies of bitcoin, who study it enough to make false claims that seem real to the most bitcoiners possible. So the more the FUDder knows, the more bitcoiners his understanding exceeds, and the more people he can scare.
I get some of my best insights from the responses to FUD, where the FUDder is corrected by someone who knows even more than him. These replies, to be effective, must be technically brilliant yet written to be understood by the people whom the FUDder just scared, who are less technical.
The **FUDpool** is the set of bitcoiners currently scared by FUD. The layers are the technical knowledge level of these scared bitcoiners, and it takes a corresponding level of greater knowledge to clear them from the pool.
The FUDpool not only affects the current price, but also the direction the price is headed, so clearing it is very important.

The administration is not in charge of anything (ok, maybe what the holiday card says or which brown people to block this week); the Federal Reserve is in charge of anything they consider significant, which is almost everything of any gravity, and that indeed includes bitcoin now. The administration isn't "mum"; rather, they are awaiting orders from on high. 
The global central banking community controls the Federal Reserve. They all think exactly the same way.
Bitcoin is a nightmare to them. They dig the blockchain a lot. It stands to reduce their costs and increase their efficiency in enslaving the world and gives accountability to their billionaire underlings like Jamie Dimon. Jamie and other big bankers won't be able to skim any more at the expense of the central banks; the central banks will thereby consolidate power and the big bankers will be on a shorter leash, or conceivable could be stroked out of existence. With some good software, blockchain automates all big bank functions. The central banks will also have unheard of surveillance powers over the global use of cryptofiat and that will enable them to manipulate humanity and events like never before. You thought Google was bad.
Bitcoin can't co-exist with the central banks in the long run. Already there's a low grade struggle going on between different parts of the establishment. The accountants and the consulting firms and the commodities markets and the investors are supporting bitcoin. Incredibly, the big bankers may have to choose and take a side with them against the central bankers. They are the only ones who can stop the central banks, and I can see a scenario in which they blow off the commands of the central banks because bitcoin is just too profitable to outlaw, and perform a coup de banq.
This is why I call bitcoin a money bomb. It is the wildest monkey wrench that has ever been thrown into the machinery of the establishment in human history.

They can't do "dirty tricks". All you can do with bitcoin is buy, hold or sell, on a bitcoin exchange. The more "big boys" get into bitcoin, the more market cap at any given moment, and the price will reflect that. We'll just get used to seeing 1,000 BTC orders go flying through the order books. We'll get used to that, trust me. Honey Badget doesn't care.

I think it's kindof a false dichotomy. The money is the vindication.
The world that applies to me, my circles, present and future, will judge me in part by what I did with the fiat I got from bitcoin going to the moon. As long as it's just in a wallet, it's neato, but once it turns into a mansion, then they see it as real. Because they won't be able to argue with results.
So, I guess the vindication (of me as an individual, not the vindication of winning some argument about the price / value / utility of bitcoin) is more important, but the money is the way I'll get that personal validation.

 you can't short arbitrage bitcoin
Arbitrate by definition is **guaranteed** profit. That's why it's such a strong driver for market correlation.
Adapted from 
Short Arbitrage for apples:
Apple future are $300 / bushel a year away. Spot is $200 / bushel. Interest rate on loans is 10%.
1. Borrow $200 at 10%
2. Buy a bushel of apples
3. Sell futures contract (for a year away). Agree to sell a bushel in a year for $300.
4. In a year (at close of contract period), deliver the apples to the contract buyer to settle the contract.
5. Collect $300 from the buyer of the futures contract.
6. Pay the lender $200 principle plus $20 interest = $220, thus making $80 *guaranteed* profit.
Short Arbitrage for Bitcoin with CME and GDAX:
Bitcoin future is $300 / coin a year away. GDAX (spot) is $200 / coin. Interest rate on loans is 10%.
1. Borrow $200 at 10%
2. Buy 1 coin of bitcoin
3. Sell futures contract (for a year away). Agree to sell a coin of bitcoin in a year for $300.
4. In a year (at close of contract period), deliver the bitcoin to the contract buyer to settle the contract. **You can't!**
5. Collect $300 from the buyer of the futures contract.
6. Pay the lender $200 principle plus $20 interest = $220, *but your profit or loss could be anything*.
You **must** sell the bitcoin in a year in order to settle the contract. The buyer isn't allowed to accept the bitcoin, as he is the apples. The price could be anything. You could lose money on the sale at that time. Your are going to collect $300 and you are going to pay $220 to the lender, yes. But, you must add to the $80 profit an unknown profit / loss on the sale of the bitcoins, which could be a loss more than $80, there are **no Guaranteed net profits!!! This can't therefore be arbitrage. Therefore, this can't be a driver to correlate the spot and future market**
Ok so the way futures are settled, means that the futures will never be above the (spot price + the time value of money). The futures are pegged to the spot in this way. The spot as defined by the index, of course. But the OP was asking how can the futures control the spot. 
In the apple example and with bitcoins, arbitrage can go into the spot market and buys items repeatedly until the spot price comes up to within (the futures price - time value of money). This drives the spot market up.
However, if the spot price is equal or above the futures price, arbitrage **cannot borrow bitcoins** so they can hold those for a year, like they could with apples (yes, magic apples that don't rot; think of grain then). No one has any bitcoins laying around available to lend. To drive this point home, when they settle, they aren't given bitcoins that they can use to pay back the bitcoins they borrowed.
So, in summary, **futures arbitrage could pull the spot market up, but it can't pull it down**, which is what the OP was afraid of.

Well, add the documentation from account history that it's actually a send. I'm in the camp that if you are 100% legal an audit is not a worry, despite coinbase having a reporting error. Coinbase knows Send vs Sell. If the report is screwed up, that's all that would need to be fixed, but even if not, the IRS knows the difference. No one can reinterpret the law for the IRS.

Does anyone know how to get my bitcoins unstuck from a transfer to coinbase after I mined .000045 coins and tried to send it there from coinbase.info? I think net neutrality is to blame? Do you think they blocked it? Or is it the IRS? I don't know how this all works; I just mine the stuff? I'm afraid if I don't get it unstuck bitcoin will be worth less when it's finally done. What do you think the price will be Tuesday? That's why I need to get it unstuck before the CME opens. Thanks.

All that, still wasn't a 1200% gain for 2017. And my point is, bitcoin will do about the same in 2018, which is way more than GBTC will, even with all the tax benefits and even with the employer matching and even with the early withdrawal penalty if you were to switch on 1/1/2018.
By the way, IRA is taxed eventually. And bitcoin HODLing isn't taxed until it's eventually sold. So that has to be taken with my point. I'm saying HODL, not trade in and out.

Taxes are a minor part of the revenue of the Federal Reserve.
They make most of their money (by a factor of 100) by charging interest on the money they issue. When a bitcoin is mined, they don't get any interest b/c it's not debt to them. 
It's very plausible the big banks could get addicted to bitcoin. We could have a war between the big banks and the Central Banks. I'm stocking up on popcorn to watch that shit.

On Kraken it depends on your verification level and the monthly limit can get high enough to clear a typical house.

They already did this with this title. $17,170 was never the bitcoin price yesterday, but look how misleading this title is. I'm saying, that's on purpose. They know 90% only read the headlines.

Normally, I would agree. But this is trash and toxic information, brewed out of the FUD of Wall Street people who don't understand or care what bitcoin is. From the media at least, it seems like 50% of them don't understand what gives bitcoin value so 50% fully expect it to "crash". 
So I say the more people ignoring it the better. The alternative is a bunch of bitcoiners spooking each other into a self-fulfilling prophesy of that stupid side show actually meaning anything.
*Qualitative*  FUD, like some "expert"'s opinion on MSM, had no effect on bitcoin price. All this is (besides a huge way to make money for the futures exchanges), is *quantitative* FUD. They are making the FUD official and are going to give an exact number to the FUD. They are going to have a quant funeral for bitcoin, and I hope bitcoin fails to appear for its own funeral.

[David with coinbase in the background]
Of all the primates on earth, only homo sapiens have such complicated mechanisms for getting what they want. But like the chimpanzees and other great apes, ultimately, sexual gratification is at the root of absolutely everything they do, and this sexual frenzy, is literally threatening the very existence of a bitcoin exchange.
[David in breakroom of coinbase as girl giggles to guy]
However, the coinbase staff are sexual too, and have their own strategies for sexual gratification. Here we see a support girl flirting with a software developer. Seems harmless enough, but let's look closer at this intricate exchange.
[David in front of a big screen of DNA animation]
She's going to induce this developer to adopt segwit in order to stop all these support tickets, and she's going to use an old chimpanzee trick - jealosy. For you see, nothing motivates a homo sapien male more than FOMP, fear of missing pussy. In the next few weeks and months, he will work tirelessly to secure the mating rights of this young female, and has become completely overtaken without even really realizing it. He doesn't know she's not serious, and he works himself to the bone.

Bitcoin is Halal. The Fatwah is linked to here:
It clearly adheres to 4 of the 5 Islamic principles of money. About the fifth element, The Islamic scholars still need to decide if mining is gambling. But with the right technical advisors, they should discover that statistically spreading out machines to clear transactions with predictable rewards is just income, not gambling.
The arab world has also been suppressed by the Global Central Banking system (Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority for example). Interest is banned in Islam, but their central bank issues money as debt!

So since 0.0001 bitcoin is worth $1.20, I say print $1.20 bills and let them buy them off you.
Why? Because people who won't spend $1.20 to get into bitcoin and don't ask curious questions are never going to get in. They don't value it. If they don't even ask questions about it (seem curious), they definitely won't get in. If they ask a bunch of questions and say neato but won't spend $1.20 to get in the game, they probably never will and are not worth some precious bitcoin. So you have the truly apathetic people and the eternally indecisive people.
You can really print some pretty bills too. Blank Stock cheque images with spiragraphs, add the qr code and denomination, and a link to coinbase, and the bitcoin icon.
But I wouldn't print more than 3, get ready for almost no one to bite. People are way more like apathetic cows than we want to admit, especially the ones who aren't already in it.

Why? So you can sell if it shows lower for Jan/Feb/March?
I'm not saying that's your reason, but to whomever it would be, *that's how they would indirectly control bitcoin, by controlling FUD susceptible people who think the futures is any indication whatsoever of what's going to happen to the bitcoin price*
They have no inside information. They know as little as we do about the price action. Worse, they have a traditional mentality where they expect things to go up and down like a see saw, which is not the model for bitcoin as it is on an S-shaped technology curve. So the futures price will be dismal compared to the real price. But who cares? It has nothing to do with bitcoin. That "prediction" is trash.
I'm not hostile towards you for asking the question despite what this looks like. I'm hostile to the FUD or the idea of Wall Street telling bitcoin what it's price "should be". Fuck Wall Street.

It's not an audit. You may get a letter. You may owe interest and penalty.
Go to bitcoin.tax to see what you owe. If you file an amended tax return you are welcome to spend $50 on turbotax and legally find another additional deduction somewhere else to actually avoid the penalties.
Interest and penalties aren't based on one item on your return but rather the whole tax owed and unpaid. Keep that below zero and heck, you might even get a refund.

They had to buy the 100,000 bitcoin first in order to do that. The more whales buy / sell like that, the more the momentary market cap will be at any given moment, hence the price.

They can't. You can't sell more bitcoin than you bought, even if you are a whale.
All these whales splashing around in bitcoin, to manipulate the futures markets, are just going to make the bitcoin market cap, and hence the momentary price of bitcoin, go higher. Possibly much higher.

This is a much needed function, lending.
This isn't a ponzi scheme. It's legitimate.

Is like the cocaine experiment with rats.
10k was like that point in the experiment where the rat completely stopped doing anything else and just sat there and continuously snorted. I haven't been out of bed in two days.

Good luck on your business. I have some questions. 
1. What's the minimum? 
2. What rate of return?
3. Would I get the returns (gains) in btc?

There are beautiful stock images of blank currency templates for checks with spirographs and other flourish.
You could photoshop one to include the bitcoin logo, the denomination (100 Satoshi)  and the public / private key pair, load it up with 100 Satoshi,and hand those to such people.
I didn't do that bc it wasn't worth the trouble, but if someone was giving a talk to a bunch of newbs it would help some of them, especially if you explain that most us dollars are not in paper.
