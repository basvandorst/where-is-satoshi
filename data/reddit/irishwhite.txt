Wait, really?  I had USD in bitfloor when it closed down and I never saw any mention of him being robbed.  Can you source that?  On the bitfloor site, he gave no reason as to why bitfloor went down and it took at least 6 months before I finally got my money back.  At the time, he was anything but straight-up.   Maybe he had good reason to give no details.  I'm not sure, but straight-up is certainly not what I would call that situation.  Thankfully I only had a little over $100 tied up in that account.  
Also, thankfully, I've not touched bitcoins since then.  Learned my lesson early on!

I used coinbase a week ago today at $104, didn't get my bitcoins till Thursday and iirc they were at about $150 ish at the time.  I was worried I'd only get market value but I actually got all that I paid for on Monday at $104.  Still, the waiting period was a bummer.

People should be scared.  All investments come with an inherent risk, but bitcoins are much more risky if their price can be influenced so easily.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:33:10
I think you misunderstood me (most likely because I wasn't being clear).  Forget about the coins I'm not selling, instead my problem is this, Will I ever actually get the USD that bitfloor says I have from the last time I sold coins.  
It was great, last week i bought coins and sold some of them.  Now I've got coins and cash in my account, but had no way to get the cash.  Now maybe eventually they'll approve my bank account and then i'll be able to get my cash, but until then I've sold virtual coins for virtual cash and have not much to show for it.

bitfloor went up to over $125.  I only know this because I sold some at my yeah-right-we-wont-see-those-prices price of $125 which I thought was just a pipedream.  Also sold some at $99 which I thought was more realistic and I had worried that there would be resistance at the $100 mark.  I was wrong, but in a good way (for me).  Today on the other hand, things are down overall.  Fortunately I got in at $70 even, had a sell for $84 then bitfloor went down for a bit.  When it came back up, i put a sell in for $75 and then had to leave my computer for a couple hours.  Came back and they sold almost immediatedly!  
Just to be safe I'm withdrawing a good amount of my money now, because i'm really worried one of these times bitfloor is going to go offline and maybe not come back.  Then what happens to your money?  It's gone.

I believe the last major crash was Sept 2011 but i'm just going from memory so don't quote me on that.  
There was a mini-panic sale on Monday 4/1 which saw a drop in about $30-40 in price.  it bounced back pretty quickly and was due people's reaction to a DDoS attack on MtGox I believe.

unless you are diehard for the cause, i'd say sell out soon.  I just can't see how much longer these prices will last.  I know i'm of a dissenting opinion on this subreddit, but it's what i really do believe.

@_date: 2013-12-26 15:44:48
Yes, it's still pending.  I contacted my bank yesterday so the payment shouldn't go through.  Although I guess that if it does go through for some reason, then you're right i probably could make a profit.  Although the exchange I used last spring (bitfloor) is no longer in existance (i think?) so I'd have to go through all the bullshit if signing up for another exchange which I'd prefer to not even have to deal with.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:00:03
I don't have a good answer for this but i've noticed in a few posts that redditors mention lag in relation to MtGox.  Maybe they're just x amount of time behind the real current value and BitFloor is more immediate?  
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:15:47
Glad to hear it!  Take my advice with an absolute grain of salt...but I think that things are going to become very interesting when MtGox opens up the floodgates again tonight at 10:00 p.m. EST
Things could certainly go up or down, but I suspect prices will rise as 80% of the market will once again be able to trade.  A large group of people watching the prices fall and hoping the price will reach it's past height could be very good for those of us that can buy now at a low price.  Good luck!
i realize mtgox is not bitfloor...but considering it's market share, many people from other exchanges will take their cues from the behemoth.

I'm going to guess you're not a fan of history nor do you actually read any articles or have any knowledge of how these bubbles usually work?

I feel so sorry for you, unless you're just making shit up as you go which is a very likely candidate.  
just because you paid nothing for coins outright and they've increased in value by whatever astronomical figure it is now doesn't mean it will either continue to do so.  You **really** need to brush up on some entry level economics or get some books on how the market works.

I use it.  I've sent money via connecting directly to one of my bank accounts and received money from them via that bank account.  only issue is i believe it takes a couple of days (i didn't buy coins through them initially).

Also, the real question isn't so much in regards to *buying* bitcoins, but *withdrawing* the cash once you sell them if you were so inclined.  I've sold some with bitfloor last monday and then realized...now I've got nothing to show for those coins except for what bitfloor says I have in their account.  I've since started the process of setting things up to be withdrawn to a new bank account by sending them a photo of my ID and my routing/acct number but it says it will take 2-3 days to set up.  So i just bought more bitcoins at that point in time so that there's a chance they'll further increase in value until bitfloor gives me a way to get my cash out.  Luckily for me, those coins have increased (from $147 to $190) so not bad.  Plus I still have the rest I'm hoarding.  :-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:48:42
if you put in a buy order for let's say 5 BTC at market and the highest priced sell order is only selling 3.05 BTC then it moves on to the next one which might only be 0.02 and the next one which might be 1.03 and so on and so forth.
This is what happens when people who shouldn't be buying bitcoins in the first place and can only afford to buy .02 BTC at a time because the price for one BTC it too damn high and then they sell their coin.  
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:13:49
No, no, no.  Come on, let's be reasonable here.  Sometimes I swear I jump into this subreddit and I feel like I've stepped into some alternate universe!  the percentage of merchants that are currently accepting bitcoins is abysmally small.  In order to really get more merchants to accept bitcoins outside of some niche techy/geeky merchants is for bitcoins to have a long run of use, misuse, and corrections directed at misuse.  Currently it's simply not safe enough to use large scale.  Seriously, think about it.  Yesterday MtGox suffered a DDoS attack in which it's assumed that someone or some group took advantage of the panic and basically coerced many people to start selling their bitcoins which lowered the price and then they allegedly bought up as much as they could when the price was low.  How can a merchant reliably market their goods when the value of a bitcoin can be so easily manipulated?  
Lastly, the bitcoin is going to take a loooong time to become mainsteam enough that our parents would even think to use it.  Oh sure, it's got all this hype now because speculators artificially caused the price to rise so fast over the last few weeks but I don't think it'll be long before they've disappeared and interest in bitcoins as a viable alternative will wane.  
I just think that many of us on this particular subreddit are deluding themselves with all this bitcoin zealotry.  For your sake, I hope that i'm wrong...but as far as I'm concerned I'm keeping my feet firmly planted on the ground!
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:02:57

@_date: 2013-04-08 21:01:00
Okay, that's certainly a good point but that's still a "what if" scenario where I'm talking about a real world "has happened" scenario.  It's not a simple as just saying, well you can withdraw from all of these different exchanges and simply transferring BTC is no issue at all.  Yes, it is *supposed* to work that way and if any of these exchanges finally validates my bank account than it will be.  Until then, it's all words/numbers on a screen.
A sell off would certainly pose a serious issue and I'm sure that's why exchanges like MtGox are limiting the amount of money you can take out per day ($1000) and per month ($10,000).  Better set up extra usernames with extra bank accounts if that's how it's going to be!

speaking of cancer, i learned some time ago about how most people can't manually stimulate their radial nerve (found on top of the thumb knuckle) with the Supramandibular Reticulum (the nerve activated when you hit your lower front teeth) simultaneously with their eyes closed without becoming really dizzy.  It's all due to the fact that the Supramandibular Reticulum is connected to the optic thalamus (optical nerve) and also the Inner Ear Equilibrium.  
I almost got sick the first time I did it, but as an experiment during college I practiced a lot and got pretty good at it.  Give it a shot!
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:27:40
That's exactly the case for me.  I knew of bitcoins a couple of years ago when Wired did an article on them and thought they sounded neat, but probably wasn't going to be more than a novelty sort of thing.  Turns out I was right, for 2 years or so.  Then a couple of weeks ago I saw someone else get tipped and commented on how I thought it was cool and I had never seen it before.  Then the OT (original tipper) tipped me!  Since then I have been following what's going on, been interviewed by a newspaper regarding bitcoins (I told him I wasn't an expert by any stretch of the imagination and had only been researching for about 2 weeks) and even bought bitcoins on Monday.  Too bad I didn't buy in when I just started looking into things 2 weeks ago when bitcoins were selling for about $70, but I still got in at $104 which is better than buying now!
So all I can say is, thank you tippers!  That little bit of coin goes a long way in assimilating other relatively tech savy people within the community.  You might think you're just giving a gift of money, but in reality you're providing a gift of knowledge.

@_date: 2013-12-26 15:35:55
Thanks!  And I think you're right.  I was using bitfloor last spring and was very happy with them until out of nowhere they just went away with little to no messages from them about what was going on.  Thankfully I had just under $150 in USD in that account when it went dark, but it was 6+ months before I finally got my money back from them and the whole time I didn't expect that I'd ever see it again.  I just can't trust these companies like I would like to, and learned my lesson from the bitfloor fiasco.  
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:31:40
**UPDATE** just got an email back from their customer service dept as seen here:  
for the lazy, they are supposedly launching a webform later today to handle setting up an ACH.  I'd still really like someone who's got more knowledge about security to verify as best they can that it adheres to best practice in terms of secure submission.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:58:34
I have.  I used coinbase to buy my coins.  it took a couple of days but I won't be going that route again.  It looks like i got lucky and they've been having all kinds of issues recently.
i traded on bitfloor and set up an ACH bank withdraw over the weekend which was finally approved yesterday.  Today the money was in my account!
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:51:30
Yesterday's lag was up to 70 minutes.  I'm not too concerned with 7 minute lag times (plus I don't use mtgox, but I think it's still important to use as an indicator since it's marketshare is so high).  Maybe if they hadn't upgraded their equipment we'd be seeing much higher lag times?

When someone tips you, and account is created automagically.  First you are sent a pm asking you to accept or deny the tip.  Then if you accept, you will get a pm that gives you the info on your new wallet.  first thing to do once you get into your new wallet is change the password.  After that, once your bitcoins have been confirmed 6 times or more, you are able to officially do something with those coins, such as transfer to another wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:57:04

@_date: 2013-04-09 22:52:10
open a new account at your bank.  DON'T give out your normal checking or savings account.  I had an account that I don't use for anything important and that's the one i linked to on bitfloor.  As soon as that cash hits my account it's getting transferred to another account so there's no way they can touch it.

bitfloor allows you to link a bank account to withdraw to.  I applied over the weekend and finally today it became active so i was able to withdraw with no problems.

Jesus...you guys get your panties in a bunch over the stupidest shit.  The headline **is not** misleading, assuming that they are right that it was caused by hackers.  The value did drop by x percent due to the DDOS attack and resulting panic selling.  Just because the resulting drop was still above the record high of the day before doesn't change the fact that there was a sudden and precipitous drop in price.  By your logic, if the price dropped down to, let's say, 50% of it's market value at the time directly due to nefarious activity and the media reported it, would you then scoff at them for reporting it?  You'd claim, "this media is sooooo misleading because the price is still above what it was a week ago!".  
Past performance has no real relevance to what was, at the time, a real downward spiraling attack on bitcoins.

Oh, and at least you have a bachelor's degree.  Read through my post history at some point if you care to know the story...but I was kicked out of high school 19 days before graduation.  Had to get my GED.  Got it, went to college.  Made dean's list the first couple of semesters and joined a co-ed honors fraternity.  Stopped paying attention to the things that I should have been paying attention to (school) and instead focused on what I shouldn't (failing relationship) and ended up failing out of school and feeling really disgraced.  that was the final nail in the coffin of the relationship i was in and had a really hard time with depression for a couple of years. 
finally I got some good breaks and worked towards a few things.  I've still got about $30k in debt that I'm working on but I've got an okay job for someone that doesn't even have a degree and i'm just going by day by day.

Money is a stress whether you have a lot of it or none.  You discounting that as trivial is absurd and very narrow-sighted.  You family and friends are unlikely to be professionals in dealing with this type of stress and shouldn't necessarily be counted on as their going to have a bias since they know you personally.

no, it will automatically set one up for you.  that's how i got into this whole thing in the first place.  A couple of weeks ago someone tipped me and after that i've been sliding down the slippery slope of bitcoins.  it's been fun...but i'm not getting much sleep recently.

Yes, this is through my checking account, correct.  Thank you for pointing that out as that certainly eliminates the Target breach from the possible source.  Maybe my account password on coinbase has been compromised.  I've changed it yesterday, so if that's the issue then hopefully it is now not a problem.

I still can't get over the fact that people can tip other random strangers bitcoins.  Such a great idea.  I'm just imagining a day where people will spend the entirety of their day trying to post thoughtful/witty/creative posts in the hopes that they get tipped enough to feed themeslves.  Okay, maybe that part isn't quite so great.  
sorry...stream of thoughts typed out directly sometimes get weird.

I kind of agree with you, assuming that people that have yet to sell their coins are the ones that all of the sudden think they are wealthy.  I was never into magic the gathering (those people were losers was my thought process back then...i've grown up slightly since then) but i was big into collecting sports cards and then eagerly going through the latest issue of Tuff Stuff magazine to see what my various cards are worth.  
you know what they were worth?  Nothing.  Because I never sold them.   Now my prized cards are sitting around in my parents house somewhere, or more likely thrown out, and they certainly have no impact on my finances.

there's some serious lag time right now.  I hope you're wearing your life jacket on 'cause we're sinking!

newbie's first post.

my API key is already disabled, but thanks for the info!  I wouldn't have thought to look at that!

Hey, if you're just playing with extra money at this point, then by all means stick it out and good luck to ya!  I'm still in as well for now.  Just don't know how much longer I'll hold out.

bitcoinity.com shows this as well...
kudos for not just creating a hardly useful site with a fine print donations address though!

ah man...I really wanted to join that kickstarter but they were sold out of the affordable (realistically speaking) version by the time i caught wind of it.  that is really awesome though!

bitcointalk isn't loading for me.  Bitfloor is also down

That *was* fucking awesome, but let's not discount all the work you guys have done as well.  sure, you can't compete with those amounts of bitcoins but even the small tips you guys provide through is enough to bring some joy to random redditors.  thanks so much for your continued generosity!
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:55:30
yeah, it's neat.  my last tip was just for the same amount that I was tipped last, which was $0.20
no where near as majestic as bitcoinbillionaire

in order for something to sell someone else has to buy...
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:57:05
I bought at $104, sold at $109.  I figured 100% RoI was good enough for me.  Cashed out, then after the crash I put some more money in to day trade with.  I'm up 30% on that money at the moment, but the last couple of days have been bad for me.  Oh well, it's all play money for me at this point.
