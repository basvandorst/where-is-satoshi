thats exactly what happens during accumulation. loads of bitcoins start moving around. huge buyers coming in quietly, and the last of the sellers giving up their weak hands. loads of btc moved way more then usual amounts. not saying that the bottom was in for sure, but this shows accumulation is starting,

I would only buy btc. Bch was an attack on bitcoin that proved unsuccessful and has later forked itself into two coins bch and btcsv. Would be hard to explain the politics of btc and bch and other forks in this reply. Its beyond the scope right not to fully explain it here

the concept behind bitcoin is owning your own value. buying stocks your still relying on the intermediaries. in my opinion it defeats the purpose of bitcoin. buy bitcoin, secure it yourself with a hardware wallet. this way you are in control of your bitcoins. when price rises you can sell them. but the key here is you are the true owner, and nobody can take them away from you if you secure it properly. the innovation behind bitcoin is owning unconfiscatable deflationary censorship resistant HARD MONEY. bitcoin is beyond what stock market prices are. bitcoin is owning proof that you have value part of a ledger system that is all over the world. if your not owning your own keys then you are trusting someone else to own your bitcoin for you, imo thats going backwards. bitcoin is about owning your own money and nobody can stop you from it.

the amazing thing about bitcoin, is everyone is free to use it as they wish. eventually good money practices will be more standard. but for the time being they really have no incentive to upgrade since it would require more dev work, and extra bundles to cross. i love btc, but feel free to use it how you like, wether you use segwit, or ln, or not is free choice and it should always be free choice

no, hardfork most likely imo should not happen. unless there is a serious emergency, and or if for any reason there is consensus with 90% or more of the users meaning the nodes not just miners. atleast thats my opinion. but i agree with the rest that market decides organically is most beneficial.
