Why would holding it make tax difficult.
Just keep a record of NYC value when customer paid.
When you do sell, that is the cost basis.

Network effects can creep up SUPER fast.
It's a relatively new phenomenom though so predicting it is hard.
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are examples where growth in a 5 year span has gone from minimal to enormous.

Receiving is anonymous if:
As long as the Wallet is not on an exchange, and the coin did not come from an exchange account in your name.
Selling into fiat is only anonymous if done in person.

Your right that Argentina is / was not socialist. They just defaulted on debt.
I gotta chime in whenever some one who has never been to, worked in, or was not born in Scandinavia says it is the best place in the world to live.
Norway has a small population and oil money so thats the exception.
But Denmark, Sweden and Finland have high living prices and not high wages. Lots of people leave to find work. Medical toursim to other countries is also popular.
What makes people say that?

Nothing would stop them but in a mass adoption scenery a single individual could have as much power as a major financial institution, which would undermind a lot of what bitcoin wanted to do.
Example. JP Morgan goes out of business (will never happen) but some guy with 1000 btc just replaces it with btc loans from his stash. The massive bank never goes away. Just changes.

people on this sub are fucking retarded.
Bill gates is rich, but he still owns a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of .0000000000001 percent of the worlds wealth.
The one percent huh?  How many people make up the one percent. It is more than 21 million people. With bitcoin their will be individuals with an actual 1% cut of the worlds money supply.
The one perecnt's wealth is also not liquid. Bitcoin is.
good question op.

HSBC has had a lot of issues of late, I closed my HK HSBC account.
The bank is built on human trackficking, drug trade, and every other unsavory trade there is. And not in the young naive school girl reddit way where all banks are bad. They were responsible for the Opium boom in Asia and Latin Americas Cocaine money storage.

i spend a few months yearly there. its not that present. 
i think the idea that every japanese person has btc comes from looking at japanese trade volume, which is high. 
but i reckon most of that comes from instutional trading, because it is legal and everything else that institutions over there would be investing in has been stagnant for 20 years.
instituions can be companies, schools, towns, etc... most countries allow insitutions to invest but limit the percents they can into certain areas to limit risk as many insitutions serve the public. unusual investments usually can only get 5% (btc). japan does not have a 5% cap on btc. 
tldr; japans trade volume comes from instutions not people
