I think you're getting a bit carried away in Bitcoin's nature there.
It is the people who determine what math is implemented that govern Bitcoin. First that was Satoshi, now it is a mixed group of developers. If people decided to break Bitcoin's math through some alteration of the protocol, there is nothing your 'governing' math can do about it. Math does many things for Bitcoin, but it does not govern it. Consensus does.

So assuming growth towards visa tps (big assumption yes, just roll with it), what can we realistically expect the hashrate to do &amp; how will that affect the cost of a 51% attack through mining? Bitcoin today may not be worth over $120 million to disrupt, but if it becomes any serious means of global transacting it could very well be.

The host just said saying 'ahh so Bitcoin is a lot like World of Warcraft gold' is perceptive, he wasn't joking.

Remember now magical it felt to instantly receive peer-to-peer money? If the OP chooses one volunteer he can send him $50 worth or so. That person will feel good and the audience will notice.

You say that as if it's *ok* to have a specific personal interest in this debate? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 07:51:59
What others have suggested: just use one volunteer as an example, now you can send this person 'a few bucks' x 30.

I like the scenario.

Point is, with Bitcoin I can withdraw my bitcoins from my exchange account and be trading altcoins on another exchange, have them securely in my cold wallet or be using them to buy pizza just a few confirmations later. Withdrawing my fiat from an exchange takes far longer and therefore does not permit me the same freedoms to do with my money as I please when I please. Let's not go back in time and make Bitcoin slower.

You seem to have missed the point of Bitcoin.

What makes you think mining technology will become more accessible in the future?

What actually happens if block sizes are not increased and the block size limits are reached?

People here seem to have some clue:

Rusty is putting the Lightning spec into a series of blog posts:
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:10:26
Can someone elaborate on these changes?


@_date: 2015-08-12 10:19:45


So how has this resulted in a low-trust model? Also, how is Thunder centralized compared to an ideal Lightning implementation?

I was able to buy just a second ago, what exactly is the deal here?

ELI5 this vote thing?

Just use Ghostery and ABP?

Appreciate the response but that doesn't really explain how it works?

Where/when/how can I see footage of this?

Yes, please set this up!

Thank you!

Do we have a list of addresses that would be considered proof if spent from?
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:02:45
Yes thanks!

Thank you for the detailed response.

Do you also have Vitalik's response?

Oh the irony of your post in this thread.

Adding this to reddit would be amazing. The ability to "disable" a moderator for your view only if you feel they are not beneficial to your experience.
