Sure, at a high enough multiple to spot.

You can already represent the value of bitcoin in whatever currency or commodity you like. Just like with gold -- Americans consider the price as $/per ounce, while the rest of the world looks at the price as local currency/per gram.
If the conversion of say U.S. dollars --&gt; bitcoin --&gt; Euros results in a different value relationship between U.S. dollars --&gt; Euros than a direct FOREX contract, people may make arbitrage trades (buying bitcoin in the undervalued fiat currency or selling it in the overvalued fiat currency) which should eventually result in these ratios being equal, whether you convert USD to Euros directly or through Bitcoin (minus any transaction fees).
It's not perfect; my local currency does not have good liquidity wrt Bitcoin because of governmental regulation, so the ratio is very out of whack compared to buying dollars/Euro directly.

I've starting following virtual currencies more closely recently. Can you explain your comment that Bitcoin "is worse than already existing solutions in almost every single way"? It's a genuine question. I had a micro/macro econ class in university, and have read some econ books over the years, but I'm mostly a software engineer.

Students get free electricity in the dorms, and many probably have high-end graphics cards for mining. Advertise that a month of mining with a 1080Ti = ~$40 in drinks, you might arrange a bar to have some kind of special for close to that minus your fees. I'd charge a lot -- 30% or more.
