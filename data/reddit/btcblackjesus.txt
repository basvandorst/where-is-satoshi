He's got the extras sitting there so that he can update his picture when it goes up again.

Is that the same government that forced all its citizens to turn in their gold for $15 an ounce? then three months later raised the price to $25?

I'll continue mining even if it falls to $100 a coin. Realistically, I can't see it dropping below $250 in January and February. 
Once March hits though, my opinion is that it will go up past $1,000.

When it hits $10,000/BTC a large majority of owners today will have already been bought out and wouldn't be able to afford to get back in

Speculation on the price going higher.
People using it to purchase items.
New money coming in from several countries.
Less being mined than what supply demands.
Good points, or extremely bad?

Since when does $1600 to invest in mining equipment equate to "hundreds if not thousands of dollars per month in electricity costs"? Keep up with the subject, huh? Realistically, any personal miner he would be able to afford would use very little energy.
IMO, there are quite a few people that mine without being forced to pay the electricity costs to run them. Active military residing in base housing pay no electricity. Government workers that live in housing provided to them, people that pay a flat fee for rent, utilities included. People that make arrangements with the company they work for putting them into the network room. It happens, get over it. 
If you actually read the article that I commented on, a guy got fired from his job for plugging in his Segway. The court ruled in his favor, and it's now being disputed in a higher court. If I'm thick for thinking he had the right to plug his motorized scooter in at work after working for the company for 26 years, then so be it.
Personally I wouldn't invest in a miner to run at home, or at work, even with free electricity. It makes no sense to me when I can purchase a miner to run at Hashnest and pay for the electricity costs out of my mining proceeds. I let them deal with the heat and the ungodly noise that they generate. It's a really good arrangement for me while putting my 0.30 btc pennies in my wallet at the end of the day.
You do whatever the hell you want. I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

BTC is the perfect replacement to the "petrol dollar", if we ever see that take effect, hold on....
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:59:00
that seems a bit more realistic, and a much better choice over any fiat
I can see it happening

Have you looked into cloud mining with a reputable firm?
ASIC miners are notorious for being loud, and generating a lot of heat. Hooking one up and connecting to a mining pool is easy enough. Keeping your hashrate, and heat low enough to have effective mining is easy enough to learn. All of the cons of owning an ASIC are pretty much gone by running one at work.
I would still advise putting the money toward hashrate on cloud mining.
$1600 US dollars at current rates gives you around 4.05 btc. Which gives you around 7800 ghs on Hashnest for S5 gh (current market rates) and Maintenance Fee:$0.001175/GHS/Day. Still makes you more btc than a personal ASIC miner.

so you would keep driving that crappy car, and living in that crappy house, knowing the whole time that you could have your own driver, and the biggest home you can imagine, all the while holding on to your digital wallet?
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:20:42
0.07 - 40% (maintenance) = 0.0420 btc daily multiplied by 95 days = 3.99 btc
420! forget btc, move to Colorado and buy weed

Do you now wish you had turned those into BTC about two months ago? Or is the extra sitting there from the profit you made?

If you plug your personal cell phone in at work while sitting at your desk, you are stealing from your employer for your own personal gain.
If you take a pen home from work and throw it in a drawer, eventually that drawer will fill up with stolen pens.
I'm not saying it's right, but every single one of us has done it, in some form.
This news post you put up here shows cases in court that were thrown out by the courts of people doing exactly the same thing.
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:31:08
assuming 100% luck, which they have shown for the past year, you end up with around 55% to 60% of the miners output. What are you basing your 1% numbers on? Just because you say it doesn't make it so. Show me facts and your supporting evidence.
If you say to buy BTC and hold it, you make zero interest, zero profit other than the increased cost of your btc. That is insane, why not put your money (btc) to work and make more?

Personally purchased over $10k in btc on Coinbase, on two different occasions. In the 5 days it took to post to my account each time it gained substantially in value.
I got my coins both times, did not get my account cancelled or frozen. Moved them out within ten minutes of each deposit.
I suggest you not do as the OP has done and gamble with coins directly deposited to a gaming site. Coinbase did nothing wrong.

I've bought daily limits, multiple days in a row from them, all at lower rates than when it was posted in my account. 
Knock on wood, they didn't do it to me yet.

Market rate on hashnest for S5's is at an all time low, making your ROI quick. Currently 0.00051 btc per GH.
Any way you slice it, 7800 gh/s with 40% maintenance fees is a sound investment for only 4 btc. They make the miners, they aren't going anywhere.

I didn't say 100% of your fiat to bitcoin. I didn't actually specify any amount, or percentage. There is nothing truly terrible about giving advice to invest in BTC, at least not with it's performance rating last year compared to any fiat.

I would guess that at least one or two of them would appreciate information about it from you. 
What if you offered them a gift of $1 or $2 worth of bitcoin in their own wallet that you helped them set up?
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:50:23
I agree with you 100%. I believe that I don't need to do anything at all. What is already in place will be more than enough push it to the moon. Things are happening right now that will drive the price up in 2016, and will continue to happen. I believe that it's extremely undervalued right now and a correction is imminent.
Still, it doesn't stop me from telling people about it, and helping people that ask for help. 
It really makes me feel good when someone that I have gotten started with Bitcoin in the past, tells me about a friend that they have helped get started.
If Bitcoin fails tomorrow, I will not lose anything that I cannot live without. If it does the opposite there is a really nice house somewhere that I'll be buying......

For someone attempting to use Btc as a replacement to say Western Union for instance, it is a much cheaper service, even with the conversion from currency to btc, and back to a different currency, mainly because of the additional fees that are charged.
There are many instances just like that, where it is a much cheaper service than what is being currently being charged.
and you sit there.

I sent some bitcoin gifts to Poland, and South Africa last month. It cost me a very miniscule amount to do it, especially when compared to the international bank transfer fees I have paid previously.

do a search for Bitclub, and Ponzi scheme and draw your own conclusion. IMO, of course it is.
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:55:56
Assuming that I get paid in Bitcoin, I send Bitcoin, the person I send it to spends it as Bitcoin. How much is that? Still 2%?
