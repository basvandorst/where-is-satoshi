The volatility will be at ease when the market cap reaches $1T and beyond. It’s extremely volatile due to it being such a small market.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:01:22
Hmmm... Well I do definetly think it is a possibility and yeah you're right .. 0.1 would indeed make you rich. I guess I was wrong. I wasn't thinking Bitcoin would be at catastrophic numbers like that.  Maybe 1M per coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:10:55
Good luck keeping it stocked. I hope he's rich.

this has been a problem for months.. i stopped using this app after it sent out funds without my approval. I restored the seed into a new wallet and the funds were there. Almost had a heartattack multiple times. Fuck mycelium
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:09:08
Sorry but you will never be rich with 0.1 btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:37:58
Sounds like a plan.. just make sure you cash at least 5% out at these prices. It sounds like even if you sell a few you will be able to retire if the price continues to go up. No need to be greedy, take some profit and never vow to never sell another coin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:56:32

@_date: 2017-12-05 11:50:06
This will be reality soon.....
All we have to do is wait for the government to realize btc is out of their control, they can ban it, criminalize it and try to do what they can, but money badger don't care.

Unfortunately if the price of bitcoin rises as people think it will by 2020/2021 the fees will be too high for them to use it. Lightning network hopefully is advanced enough where people can use it without having to deal with the technicals

We charge 5% for buys and sells at our ATMs. I own about 6. And they all get a ton of a traffic. Sometimes we can't even keep up. Although we do not pull from exchanges, we use our own btc.
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:41:50
You probably bought it from one of my ATMs lol :)
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:13:55
It varies... One of our machines does 50-100 transactions a day, the others anywhere from. 5-15..  they are located in coffee shops with good hours.

The government officials of China will never fully regulate it out there, simply because they themselves want to use it to move money out of the country. BTC will rise no matter what 
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:03:19
I personally own 6 ATMs in Canada. Good investment. Depending where you pull your coins from or how you acquire them. Margins can be quite profitable 
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:59:28
It is available and works everywhere!
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:19:11
I own 10 bitcoin atms in Vancouver, Canada, and yes 11% is high, we charge 5%. But at the same time you have to understand the volatility of the market. Sometimes we buy 200 coins at a time and they drop $40-$50, you can do the math there. These fees are to cover the companies ass so they dont get burned if the price drops. Im sure this company is buying their coins are 2-5% above market price hence the high cost.
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:13:36
Retire in 5 years off 1 BTC? You will be lucky if you can retire of 10-15 btc in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:37:41
Most likely up, as more supply is being pulled off the market. Could possibly go down as well of course. I don’t think we will see green for months straight. But rather a slow grind up with various corrections seems more likely.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:34:26
Cause when they settle they pay out big contracts in btc. Therefor pulling new supply off the market in big chunks.
The difference Between this announcement and past announcements is that in the past they hadn’t announced they had got the green light to launch. It was delayed due to delayed approval by the CTFC. Which is no longer the case.

There was a recent article of a Japanese business mogul who was wearing a $800K Richard Mille outside his hotel in Paris that got robbed for it. The financial crime unit got involved due to the cost of the watch. Pretty scary stuff.
If you have 800 grand to drop on a watch I think it’s smart to hire security during your stay in a foreign country.
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:00:33
For reference those rings are going for about $450K a piece
@_date: 2019-10-17 10:49:58
seriously ? Where did you see that?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:31:07
Strange. Is it requiring you to buy the btc directly from coinpayments or do you already have the btc you want to pay with ?
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:46:00
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:22:47
Why are you using coinpayments
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:31:34
Sorry to hear.
In the future, use a real exchange. Shapeshift and Changelly have a bad rep.

Well then in that case , buy In now and get out before the top.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:37:09
I would say due to the fees at the moment, it wouldn't make sense to throw away millions in transaction fees. Makes more sense for exchanges to halt transactions.

i hope it wasnt too much, ive been reading alot of people's post about coinbase holding funds and shit. Good luck brotha
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:56:04
To be honest I don't really think the large holders would risk even moving coins if there's any risk at all... Why be greedy when you're already a whale. Anyone who's been in this space isn't gonna sweat the price drop after the fork. Just another day bro. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:40:28

i have been told that the hardfork will implement a tweak to this, where the difficulty may not actually be as hard as we think. Any truth to this? Also, it is not a guaranteed thing the miners will switch back over, is it? What if they have been so brainwashed into thinking BCH is the new BTC they dont even move back. Does it make sense to mine at a loss? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:41:34
She's looking good !
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:32:40
Well let's put it this way, if you got 50 phone calls a day from people asking what Bitcoin is, would you explain to each and every one of them for 10 minutes on what it is and how it works ? My time is more valuable than that. I provide a service, its up to you to figure out if you want to use that service or not. If I was a customer support line, yes I agree. These are the same people who lose their private keys and blame Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:25:09
Someone wanna comment on this ? What's going on.. these aren't real forks of btc. Just alts I believe.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:08:05
I believe this truely a lie... There is multiple videos on bitconnect users getting hacked.. my guess is they are trying to avoid taxes or save face.

Damn. Then you deserve to be poor lmao
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:44:09
Here's what I can suggest..
1. Figure out where you're going to source your coins from, volume can get crazy.
2. If you're going to use an API to pull from an exchange, how much float are you willing to store on the exchange at all times.
3. Get the banking approval and requirements taken care of.
4. Make sure all necessary licenses are in order and if you're in good standing with the government.
5. Make sure you have 100k in float at all times, and a new work phone because you will be getting a whole lot of calls.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:16:51

To be fair, I deal with new comers everyday who are learning about Bitcoin. The amount of people who want to buy Bitcoin without knowing what it is or how to download a wallet is staggering. Anyone with half a brain interested in something like btc, who does their own research and learns themselves gets my respect. But people who don't take the time to learn, fuck up and blame someone else is not something I'm for.

@_date: 2017-10-11 17:27:30
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:38:54
Yeah it's just recorded in the blockchain. 3rd party means that if you decide to send your btc out of your account, the platform you're using has to approve the withdrawal before funds leave your account. Jaxx does not require this to send or receive funds. Just create a paper wallet from the link above and send your btc to the public key. Choose single address wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:08:17
No one is really sure how the claiming of coins will work or what wallet your coins need to be in when it forks. Everyone's waiting for the same answers including me, I'm sure there will be some info soon. For now pull them off any exchanges or 3rd party wallets you're using.

@_date: 2017-10-30 13:41:36
Yes is it most definetly safe.. please have your trezor handy with you when you are transferring your coins. There will be two wallets, one will be legacy. Create a legacy wallet and move your btc there, and don't touch it. You can move your coins to the other wallet once segwit has been adopted more and you're comfortable with it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:47:59
Mine has done this a few times in the past. Yesterday being one of them... Mycelum on Android was sending out funds and showing payments without even me sending them. Also it kept crashing my phone non stop and was super buggy. Thankfully I got my coins out of there into a new wallet. I've been using it for 3 years but that just almost gave me a heart attack again. Never using mycelium again.

Haha I understand that brother.. Regardless if the video was old, this man had/has this much btc. It's unlikely this man liquidated 800+ btc over the years, therefore it is a possibility that he still holds the majority of this.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:48:52
The funny thing is, most of the people that are most excited about price action are the ones with less than 0.1 btc... It's pretty entertaining.

Man there's like 100 posts on this in the last day, quit acting like I'm the issue here. Quit spamming this sub with the same shit over and over and search for once. If you're not smart enough to figure that much out you're not smart enough to be investing in crypto.

@_date: 2017-10-11 16:01:03
Really ? I've been using mycelium for years. It's always been reliable. The only thing that erks me is the whole crowdsale scam. Other than that the wallet has been solid. Does GreenAddress need registration?

That's all?
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:51:34
Where are you located.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:45:18
Really it all depends on what you're doing with your coins. If your in it for the long term then don't even worry about the price swings. If you're day trading btc and the swings yeah you could take a big loss.. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:20:19
You have 3 choices really...
1. Buy a hardware wallet and pay for overnight shipping. (Trezor)
2. Go to  and create a paperwallet in which you own the private key. Best to tether from your data while doing this. Keep this on a usb stick offline somewhere safe till you can get a hardware wallet.
3. Create a mycelium/Jaxx/GreenAddress/electrum/copay and store your funds there, and secure your 12 word seed.
All you have to do is send it to an address which you own for one of those keys and your'e good to go.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:04:11

@_date: 2017-10-11 15:55:19
Trezor has already implemented segwit and segwit addresses. It is up to the user if they want to use Segwit or the "Legacy Wallet" which is the old trezor wallet. I could not imagine my life without this device. Infact when the 2.0 comes out I'm gonna get it and keep 2.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:52:49
? Lol...
Yeah Hodl your 0.1 btc . One day you'll be rich.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:53:19
Well, I can't say that it's better. Personally I just like the ease of use when it comes to trezor. I had the nano, something about the interface and stuff didn't really make me feel good about it. Once I got my trezor I was impressed. The amount of little tricks there are to protect your btc even if someone gets a hold of it somehow are amazing. I can't wait till the 2.0 is released.
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:05:15

@_date: 2017-10-10 14:03:09
Hahah don't worry too much about it, there's two outcomes.
You get free shitcoins which will be sold for btc or fiat.

This guy knows what he's talking about.

I think a few people are waiting for the answer to this. Trezor hasn't decided what they are going to do. I'm sure they will give you 1:1 on the new chain. Follow their twitter for updates. Also there is multiple posts in the sub asking the same question. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:41:03
created throwaway account two days ago, sends btc to wrong address today. Hmmmmm
if you're not trolling, thats unfortunate.. How did you manage to send it to an address that was in your clipboard?
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:52:27
^^ this
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:26:01
Trezor hands down. Nothing more to discuss.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:44:02
I dont believe anyone has heard any news from trez yet, we are all waiting on the edge of our seat m8
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:58:48
great article
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:54:59
Legacy is basically the old btc trezor wallet. You should be using that if you are unsure. In regards to the fork, I believe the legacy wallet is ok.

Came here to say this lol

I always found typing the question or topic in Google and adding the word Reddit after it turns up miracles.
Ex: Bitcoin 2x fork reddit
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:23:08
I don't use a lever, I use a handle.

You got your space suit on ?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:00:15
Man! I feel bad. But if you're strong enough to withstand the highs and lows of the hodl, you can quit cold turkey. Don't be weak, be a man. It's just a placebo. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:14:04
Get your funds out of there... I've been using mycelium for years. I've seen this issue twice now recently.. I've also sent a few grand and it showed my whole balance sending to unknown addresses. This fucking shit has almost given me a heart attack twice now. 
This is the last time I'll be using this wallet ever.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:47:45
Man, I couldn't agree more... But 15 posts a day on what a fork is and what wallet to use.. that's excessive.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:08:21
My dudes a savage
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:35:44
Fuck that's awful. I think I remember seeing a thread similar to this. Someone sent his btc to his BCH address. I'm sure you can find it somewhere, I'm not sure what the outcome was... Really shitty, but hey you could have been the poor bro who lost 95 coins yesterday. You will make it back.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:07:51
Why don't you just sign up and find out? I believe there's two methods. One in person with cash or online with your cards and I believe the site kind of holds it like an escrow.. could be wrong
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:31:06
Where in Canada are you
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:21:18
Questions are great.. we get that it is important that you safely complete this task. The problem is, this is asked 10 times a day in this sub. For godsake please do a search. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:57:26
Fair enough, not going to argue. I just figured a more straight forward approach would make them realize that it is in fact important to search and dig for answers and THEN ask if you've turned up with nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:03:09

You my friend have a wild imagination, what strain is that?
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:54:39
If that's the case im sure alot of people would have died of old age lol
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:43:55
Guys ! Let's listen to fud from someone who can't even spell!
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:43:38
hahahhahahahahahha lol this is great joke!! you should be a comedian
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:57:14
Alot of people have been credited but balances aren't showing up. There's also no markets right now so don't panic
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:22:19
Fair enough... Don't believe the fud... Nothing will replace btc. Claim your new coins, sell half for fiat or btc and keep the rest. That way you didn't lose anything and you may win in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:29:21
I would still think in the back of their minds people will price a gallon of milk around ~$4
I think it will always be relative to the btc price, no matter how high it goes changing cost of btc for the milk will always be $4 just depends on the fluctuation to determine the amount. Also I don't think there will be a time soon where money isn't pegged to a crypto. But that's a interesting question.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:39:32
Just don't respond, he's bluffing.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:04:54
You want to cash out ALL 0.06% of your btc. You're gonna be a rich man
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:23:16
I've seen this with mycelium on iOS... Just subtract the fee from your dollar amount and type it in manually.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:09:16
Man its crazy to think that so many people on this sub and responding in here have less than 1 btc. Happy that you guys have decided to get in recently, the future looks bright.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:01:54
If you're asking this you likely already missed the bounce
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:00
I haven't paid attention to that portion in awhile.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:36:47
At the moment its really not meant for these small size transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:49:18
The TI-83 stopped producing gains after the last halfing. They have switched to ps4's. Just make sure you know what you're doing when you're setting everything up. Feel free to reach out.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:08:39
And you're one of the dumbest people in the space
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:24:21
The answer to all of your questions.
Yes it will be safe on mycelium
Yes you will own your seed, but not private key.
You know just as much as everyone else whether you will recieve coins based on what wallets your coins are sitting in. Please standby or do a search in the future. 
Why are newbs always the most entitled? I bet if I said it's gonna cost you $10 in btc for the info you woulda searched real quick.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:20:05

I don't think you're gonna get any sympathy in here.
This sub is not for drug addicts begging for money.
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:55:06
It depends on the provider. Some most have a certain amount you can buy without ID. Usually 1-2K without I’d and anything above you need to provide a phone number or picture I’d.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:51:20
Pretty much
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:47:29
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:54:13
Most likely
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:36:08
No one in r/Bitcoin will tell you it's a good time to buy BCH. It's a deadbag. The only hope there is for BCH is if Roger and Jihan get the funds to pump it one more time.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:33:54
Last run up I believe I lent out 2 btc at 1%. It was epic
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:14:35
Yeah... I agree with you. I would say ANYONE should have 10 btc minimum if you're looking for any type of significant increase in wealth over time.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:38:41
So you're saying buy more before Nov 17th lol
@_date: 2019-09-06 20:35:29
Most likely tied to huobi
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:23:04
its only 0.1... good number to start with depending on your financial situation.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:05:02
Lol omg you're kidding.......
This guys trolling...
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:59:35
I look at my gains from may 1st to now and I'm just like is this even real..
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:42:08
I've sold some on the way up, unfortunately quite a bit at 1090 USD
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:48:59
Most likely not... Unless you use the market place.
