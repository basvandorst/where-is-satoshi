I will jump from the roof, I have a roof now ;)

The majority of people here are not aware of Bitcoin yet. I could have waited for BTC to become mainstream, but that may take too much time, more than I can afford..

I sold it using local currency, to someone who was willing to invest and take the journey from there.

I will upload some photos tonight.

I already have a horse.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:31
it's already a house and a half...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:46
Possible, but your village is speculative, and my house is rock solid real.

No bamboozle.

I'm not worried of IRS, we don't even have one ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:55:59
Maybe, but at least I have a house now.
Better safe than sorry ;)

We don't have Walmart here, and if you spend a night in a tent you might get robbed or even killed.
Are BTC useful in heaven ?

I'm from Tunisia, and house prices vary from $40 000 (small house) to infinity.

Thanks, but I don't think so. I fear that in 2 year I will experiencing the same stress again :D

You should settle down on something, and aim for it. Otherwise, you'll never reach your goal, you will be trying to reach the things "higher than your pocket".

Yes, I started this 2 years ago as an experiment. I'm not fun of adrenaline and strong sensations. I prefer stability.
Yes, I think BTC is the future. But I also think that it's money, and money must buy things we need.
I needed a house, so when I reached required amount, I bought it. It's that simple.

We (3rd world) can't simply move from a country to another.
You can visit as a tourist, but you can't stay. 
The only exception are political or war refugees.
