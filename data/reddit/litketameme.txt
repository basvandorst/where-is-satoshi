Naww I wish haha, I'm too poor to even be able to think of investing in Bitcoin haha �� Trying to sell a bunch of my stuff so I can afford a few new clothes for the summer. Nothing fancy haha just a few t shirts or something

I was just wondering if it is entirely possible for someone to hack me solely by me just posting my PayPal email for them to pay me

Jesus, my bad man genuinely wasn't aware, I've heard of like ddosing and shit but I didn't realise they could find all that from a username
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:44:11
Oh right I see, well thanks for explaining that. The guy could've toned it down a little bit haha. Bit rude tbh
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:18:58

@_date: 2019-05-27 21:02:09
Ok man thank you :) how much would one have to invest? My job is extremely awful so it leaves just little money to invest
