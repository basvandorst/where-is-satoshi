I'm not expecting it to be easy, but exponential growth is a beautiful thing.

BTG is not a serious coin at all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:20
This is a much better idea. You are much more serious and devoted if it's your real money at stake.

Your wealth is determined by the total value of assets you own. So yeah, you can be rich without having any money.

All you need is 1% per day. That way you'll be a millionaire soon.
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:15:43
This. If it was popular, there would be adoption. Most people just want to get rich.

Haven't really been paying attention recently, what are the fees at the moment for a payment like this?

Why are crypto articles always retarded. It literally repeats the same paragraph twice, once saying current quantum computers have 100 qubits but need 2300 to crack encryption, and once saying they need 1500 qubits to crack encryption. It then goes on to say how far quantum computing therefore is from breaking encryption. I’d say that is pretty damn close, especially given that most advancement has been made only in recent years. The development goes extremely fast and, most likely, exponential.

Lol why are you being downvoted
@_date: 2019-03-29 18:09:03
It’s interesting how crypto culture attracts so many of them..
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:01:45
Yeah lol, this is how news works.

So the left guy is talking about "interconnecting" of exchanges. Is that what is going to happen? Everything will become one big liquidity pool? What would be the effect of that?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:55:21
Bittrex: no fiat. Bitfinex: not for US customers. Sadly, there aren't many options..

They are actually pretty active on Reddit and I have communicated with them before on this issue. However, their only response is, "We are aware of the issue and are working on a new trading engine".
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:03:59
That's a lot of money. People would do it for $2,500 just as gladly..

It's not about comparing it to credit card transactions, it is about comparing it to other, much cheaper and faster cryptocurrencies...

If you're US based, I like Gemini.

Both subs are extremely one sided, so best to read both and form your own opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:59:05
Don't worry, just move your funds elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:07:03
Though technically you have greater reward en less risk when you are a daytrader or other short term trader.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:12:06
People will try to hack you.

The Netherlands has no capital gains tax, only a flat rate on capital (1.9-5.6%). But it doesn't matter where your bank account is, as long as you're still working and living in a different country, you'll be liable to tax there.
@_date: 2019-04-10 20:22:51
Well, they might start by hacking your Reddit account, then email, etc.

Shorting, he is the bear of course, constantly getting fucked in the ass by the ever rising Bitcoin..
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:13:13
How is this an argument? Bitcoin isn't even used as a currency yet, the US is a COUNTRY of 330 million people...
