Needs Steve Wozniak on it. He’s definitely a pledged supporter. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:38:19
Agreed. Just want it to be implemented. Business is business, but in the long term I think it’d be worthwhile for all parties.

Also if you find this do not share this information with ANYONE, even friends. The words are essentially the keys to the safe. Research more into it if you do find it.

Upvote! This should be front page news.

I’ve tried entering my current breadwallet address into it but it all says 0. Does this happen to you?

Uber troll? Or Uber stupid?

OMG what is this movie?? Watched it so many times as a kid but it slipped my mind.

Mr. Spacey is on line one.

Green Address for segwit capability. Do you want high transaction fees and longer transactions? If not utilize a segwit wallet please. Everyone should be using segwit.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:32:20
Do you mean actually utilizing it as a payment? Or selling it for fiat? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:56:59
Well if you had more bitcoins you would be gooder.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:20:15
Try and get familiar with Segwit wallets. I’m not saying you’re doing anything wrong, a lot users don’t use it either. But there are ways to send cheap and fast transactions. It depends on the wallet you use. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:51:08
The right path on getting Bitcoin mainstream. Fingers crossed heavily. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:39
So much trolls in this sub nowadays. Did Roger pay you to infiltrate this sub? GTFO
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:47
GTFO troll. You’re the type of cancer that this sub doesn’t need. We need mature investors who appreciates the core technology and not only the profiting. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:15:39
big big news!

If they don’t have it in your country then find someone (with great and plentiful reviews) in another country that can western union you the money.

Man who are you.. You’re truly someone special. And successful lol. All the best to you in life.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:08:29
That’s all speculative. Bitcoin was never made for investment purposes. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:29:59
The article comes from someone that doesn’t even quote anyone saying this from the PRC government... All opinionated speculation as always. Nonetheless I hope it’s true, but hopefully coming directly from the government itself.

I'm a hodler for sure but everything that goes up in extreme amounts could also drop in extremity too. Best to judge this by yourself and take the advice of no one.

@_date: 2018-03-20 22:41:05
Thank you.

Regardless of what skeptics say. If an insititutional giant comes in like this, Bitcoin prices most likely will never drop down to 0. I have faith in the long term development of Bitcoin. It's prices now obviously doesn't reflect, but gradually I believe it'll make steady gains over time. The boom of 2017 was short lived and any experienced trader would know that. Nothing goes up that fast and stays up. That's impossible. There will be ups and downs just like any investments. I'm looking forward to Bitcoin's natural growth over the next few years.

How much dogecoin would it cost? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:17:59
At least you aren’t in the kids for Bitcoins

Man I hope this works! Some good news needed. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:21:24
This needs more upvotes.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:00:59
I love Bitcoin and am a Hodler myself but I do have anxiety knowing if they decline it again the market will bomb. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:45:20
Same shit different day. There will always be countries and entities that will be pro crypto and others that are against it. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:57:09
Coinomi for me
