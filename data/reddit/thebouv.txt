Found the 12 yo full of angst.

Funny how the qr code seems so much cleaner and brighter than the rest eh?
Almost like someone overlaid their own address on this image. Certainly no one would do that.

And yet I've been a user for months and I can't add a new payment type. They simply do not accept the verification amounts. Hell the first time I requested them they sent three! And asked for two. No combo worked. 
Asked for new numbers. 
See them on online statement. 
Don't work. 
Ask bank directly. 
Same amounts. Don't work. 
And for over two weeks I've been trying to get them to help me.

And even with the flood of money they're getting, they still have shit support.
I would love to buy the dip, but can't.  I've been a member for a little bit and all transactions were fine.
But trying to add a new payment method, they won't accept the verification amounts.
So now I'm stuck unless I move elsewhere (Gemini I guess).

Gah! Had no idea. When I went to search for this feature all I found were threads from the developer bitching about people not talking in bits instead of fractions of a Bitcoin.

Fix it for him and make a pull request. :)

Same.  I have the smallest smidge of bitcoin and have for a while, but wanting to buy some with USD through Coinbase has been a complete let down over the past few days. Terrible.

I just wish they'd give me an alternate way to show besides only bits. 
No exchange or seller works in bits or uses that term or symbol. I literally only ever see it in their wallet.
