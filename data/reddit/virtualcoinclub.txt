There is no encryption.  There is signing with the private key and verifying with the public key but no encryption using the public key

From a link in the article: "La Poste Tunisienne will strictly control the issuance and circulation of the eDinar in order to prevent it from being used for illegal transactions."
There is no indication on the Monetas website (mostly fluff) on how circulation will be controlled.

Simply put: nothing.  Encrypting private keys in a wallet is optional, Bitcoin works perfectly fine without encrypting the private keys.  It even saves time when you use the keys.  It is prudent to encrypt them if you do not trust your OS.
The question in return is how do terrorists use the encryption of private keys in wallets to harm the US?  Why would the US care at all about that use of encryption if it is not a threat?  Thus it would not fall under the scope of regulation of encryption.

Encryption that can be repurposed by terrorists?  If yes, is the encryption a direct application of Bitcoin encryption or is it added encryption that can be added to any protocol along with suitable steganography.   Alternatively if Bitcoin encryption used to secure a wallet is repurposed by terrorists, how is that different from securing a wallet for any illicit purpose?  In that case how is securing a wallet different from locking your door to secure your physical possessions?  Why have locks since they just aid terrorists?

You haven't shown how Bitcoin clients provide encryption useful to terrorists since you are ruled out "over-the-wire".  You haven't shown how Bitcoin "encryption" would be banned, only claimed it would be.  At least you gave up on your other straw man of encryption of private keys in a wallet.
You need specifically to show how the removal Bitcoin "encryption" would cause it to not work.

I'm sure their ID requirement is more prophylactic than actual damage to my privacy for now.  But eventually the government will want records of transactions or even just list of IDs.   I should also mention they buy a similarly steep discount.  Looked like about a $70 spread in their sell and buy prices.

The coincafe FAQ says "Do you accept personal checks?
Sorry we do not accept personal checks. You can have a bank check made at your bank or a money order at any US Post Office, Moneygram, or Western Union location."  On another page they say you can mail them cash.

I used an ATM (virtualATM.net) for the first time on the way home from work Friday night.  First it asked for my drivers license bar code, then spit out a piece of paper with an address and private key.  Next I fed all the cash I had with me ($160), and it printed out a purchase receipt for 0.391 added to 1GgW5GhrbS55NerfvZgkLy9VkypVfxm4cP  Today I looked and it is still there, so I suppose there was no secret camera aimed at the ATM picking up printed private keys.
But it was about as easy as it could possibly be.  Expensive too.  It cost $409 when the market price was about $370.

This is a Bitcoin thread and Bitcoin is powered by coal so if you are concerned about "climate change" you need to be on a different thread.  On the flip side Bitcoin enables brand new knowledge and data services which allow the economy to transition from physical to virtual.
Bitcoin enables pure capitalism which allows the allegedly overpopulated masses to save and invest their earnings without the threat of government confiscation and sell their labor in a free and open market.
The bottom line is there are no sustainable "alternatives" to capitalism.  You have not named any above, nor has anyone else throughout history.

The idea that a modest amount of global warming is causing "extreme" weather is indeed not scientific.   For one thing everywhere on earth the natural variation is greater than the manmade warming.  "global warming" is scientific.  "Climate change" is not.

I spread bitcoin using Denarium.  Costs more of course, but people are very unlikely to throw away a Denarium or other physical coin.  The downside of course is that that only works once since the coin cannot be partly spent without essentially destroying it (peeling off the sticker to get the private key).  A better way to spread would be an electronic physical coin that would allow collecting but also spending.  Would be like a Trezor but much cheaper so they could be given away.
