Tracy is a recovering heroin addict who works at a needle exchange. You can see her featured in the documentary [Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street]( when she was very deep into her addiction. She is clean now and helps the current users in try to better their lives.
Tracy is a wonderful person. She's very intelligent and is kind of the light at the end of the tunnel for opiate users. She gives them hope and leads by example. Many recovering heroin addicts cannot do what she does. There is absolutely no doubt that she is saving lives by doing this. I have a lot of respect for her.

I believe no matter how hard we tried to prevent war, the government would still pursue war as a solution to the worlds problems. There are things the public just doesnt have access to that the government does which allows them to believe war is acceptable. Young men enlist for various reasons and even with the knowledge of what they are getting themselves in to doesnt amount to the reality of what really happens during war. Opiates help to numb the pain they suffer from war and what they experience because of it, and society has no other choice but to help them in as many ways as possible.
Overall, it is more difficult to prevent our government from going to war than it is to provide help to those who have experienced the torments of war.
