@_date: 2017-07-22 02:04:19

So you basically you just assume you know whats going on in other peoples heads, assume they listen to your bullshit, and then pat your ego on the back for your own projections. You really are a character.

For the record, I stopped caring what you had to say a long time ago.

I am using Jaxx. Even on minimal transaction it was still something like 0.000883.
I will look into mycelium.

I cant open either of the windows installers, they are unresponsive...

Keyboard warrior prides believes he is superior to others because it sits on a forum all day, considers himself some sort of psuedo-freud champion of knowledge.
I dont think I've met such an amusing online persona in quite some time

well I got an email today saying it was activating in 50 hours, so blame "cryptocompare" says right in my email "will be locked in and activated in roughly 50 hours"

it cost me 0.000783 to send the same amount from the exchange I bought it at, to my wallet, now my wallet (jaxx) wants me to pay 0.001 btc for a fucking transfer... 
even on the "slowest cheap" setting...
WTF is going on... this is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:53:16
you're a condescending prick with a superiority complex. I clearly stated that I did not know much about bitcoin or segwit, I came here because I figured somebody in the know could explain it to me, because I tried searching on google about higher fees and couldnt find anything.
Not everybody lives on reddit and moderates bitcoin cults...
again, gtfo troll.
you should shut the fuck up, and get a life.
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:11:06
your forum rep getting you a lotta places in life? I'm sure your rousing discussions about bitcoin are all the rage with your friends. Do you make them kiss a ring and give pledge before you grace them with your presence?

they posted a response yesterday that makes me question how safe electrum is, are you guys sure because this really doesnt seem like the right wallet to get bcc
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:56:17
seriously what wallet is safe to get BCC? I've been asking for days and nobody has a straight answer
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:59:41
You are the one with the attitude. you pretentious asshole.
I really dont give a fuck what you have to say, considering your tone has been completely rude since your first post, and since you pride yourself on being a condescending asshole, there is really nothing I can say to you that will go through because of your mislead inflated ego.
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:50:33
well I tried to download the setup for the newest version and both the exe and installer will not run, so my confidence in electrum is somewhat shaken, my version is atleast 4 months old
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:45:42
wow arent you just a fucking huge asshole huh?
gtfo of my thread please.
I'm not a fucking investor, im just trying to pay a friend back... he wanted it in bitcoins, you don't have to be such dick. Sorry not everybody has time to sit on their computer and read forums all day.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:10:50
you're holding the mirror the wrong way bud.
I asked 5 questions, including the thread title and I did try and figure it out beforehand, which is why I said mind my ignorance because it is not my area of expertise. You're just a jaded asshole who is looking to pick fights on forums to boost your sad ego. You should have left the thread when I asked you to the first time and maybe you wouldn't have tarnished your prized forum rep.
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:41:56
thank you, this makes more sense now. I appreciate your response. im sure there has been a lot of these posts
