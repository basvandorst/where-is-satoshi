But… correlation between the two doesn't *imply* infinite growth:  
  
Couldn't it go sideways?  
Couldn't the # of transactions die off to sync again?  
Couldn't the price ascend and *then* go sideways?

Ehh, we're only stuck until we start consciously changing how we talk about BTC and its value. I think that with a roundabout base value of 1k+, we get the chance to talk about mBTC being more than a dollar, a familiar value for a new generation of buyers.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:05:51
Agreed. If 1k+ becomes the new base standard, I think we, as a community, really need to discuss messaging rather than maintaining a "people will eventually come around" mentality; and it's not an all or nothing, but that of a meeting the consumer in the middle.  
  
Thanks for the response, btw.

Ah, I mean, I try to discuss both but I let the conversations drift to whatever aspects of bitcoin seem the most interesting to the person to whom I am talking. And, by the end of the conversation, we've typically touched upon it as both an emerging technology and that of an investment. Funny thing, everyone who hasn't invested/purchased BTC, without fail, brings up the price; it's sort of all the mainstream buyer has to go on without going down a rabbit hole of google/SERPs, because to find information on the technology side (and even as a store of value), the media doesn't help much.  
  
I think you raise a great jumping off point for that of explaining bitcoin as two sides, an investment and as a technology. I'd push that we, as a community, look into changing our language to reflect the denominations/currency, and the potential that mBTC might make bitcoin more relatable to the new generation of buyers.  
  
Ah, and to echo YRuafraid's statement, I never try to sell/push people on investing, I just provide the reasons as to why I am invested.

Family and friends; I'd guess that after the holidays, with this recent pump, some/most will have had this experience.

You end up [investing in the market itself]( for the long-term, thus minimizing risk. It's just a less risky way of investing, and for a market as volatile as Bitcoin (and crypto in general), dollar cost averaging can still offer really good gains while minimizing the impact of losses.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:01
Dollar cost averaging is (pretty much) always the best bet. $X a day/week for the long haul.

1 hour after you write this, as we are testing a support line, Coinbase is down again (_edit: was down when I decided to type this, is now displaying "Oops! Something went wrong" after every UI click_).  
  
They need to fix their server problem. They have always had one. They don't learn, or they're choosing to cut costs by not implementing a better offload for when traffic spikes.  
  
But, unfortunately, I'd bet that they'll continue to have this problem for years to come.
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:36:47
Waiting on a reply for 3 days now. They're a bit overwhelmed I think, haha.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:55:54
Gotcha. Sorry for my confusion. Uber tired. And yes, lucky for them, in that scenario, bitcoin was kicking ass.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:02:22
Sorry to hear. Going forward, I hope that the treatment I got today is  implemented as the standard for Coinbase from now on. Sucks to hear your side, and past treatment from them.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:02:10
Yep, same boat. Took me 4 tries. Got it an hour ago, finally :-)  
  
Still haven't gotten any BTC though. Denied (twice) as high-risk. ::sigh::

Market*^cakeday*ing knows *^cakeday* no ethics. ...*^cakeday*
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:47:13
It's crashing right now.  
  
Edit: Was. Dropped to 565 on BitStamp. Back to 590 right now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:41:36
Gosh, you're the only one who gets me. Thanks hisham. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:17:21
Haven't even hit the point of withdrawing BTC yet. Thanks for the heads up. It'll allow me to plan for the worst when that time comes. Hopefully it gets fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:32:55
That's a good point. I mean, a random cancellation has to waver your confidence. Especially as a Level 2. Hopefully they're working on it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:19:54
Good on you for your decision. Sound like you had had enough.  
  
I agree that the wait times are preeeeety long right now. Nearly intolerable. In my case, all ended smoothly. If/when it doesn't, I'll probably have some not-too-kind words to say (I was saying them days ago, haha). But for now, I like the progress they're making.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:57:28
Horror story after horror story. I guess I'm lucky I got taken care of. I just hope my situation becomes the norm for how Coinbase handles their customers. I was negative and they turned me into a Belieber. Let's see how long it lasts!
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:53:53
Apologies, makes sense now.  
  
Long week and a loooong day at work have ruined my ability to comprehend. Me no understood good. спасибо (thanks :-D)
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:13:36
Yeah, they do. It's why I submitted this follow up. And thanks for that link! I had never seen this issue raised. Now, I can keep an eye out when tipping (or getting tipped!). Please post/pm me and let me know how it turns out. Could be an issue in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:39:01
How long did your reply take? Just curious.
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:08:51
Rees from Coinbase just emailed me. So it was a turnaround time of 108 hours. 4 1/2 days. Just an update!
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:53:32
I'm still waiting on a successful transfer. Got two of mine cancelled (high-risk). Maybe this third one will work. Also still waiting on a support email from my first cancellation (asked to be whitelisted). Tried to buy at $320ish, then 350, and now 400. Not too happy. However, I did just read about coinsetter? I know nothing about them but I think I'll set up and see how they work. PM you results.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:04:28
I was badmouthing them for the past few days. Figured I'd follow up, give my account, and set things straight. Typically, when you hear about someone complaining, you never hear them follow up on how things were handled. OP delivered. You're welcome.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:15:26
Damn, double-edged sword much?
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:26:43
Everything gets sorted out. Thus, rest easy. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:09:08
I feel you. When did you mail them?
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:21:28
How the hell did you get so lucky? I opened my account on the 7th, purchased on the 8th (1BTC), got flagged as high risk on the 10th, send a support email that day, tried to buy again (2BTC) after sending, and just got flagged as high risk again about an hour ago.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:16:58
I'm right there with you. Tried my first time at $300, high-risk cancellation two days later. Tried a second time at $350, high-risk again. Have been waiting for a support response for days now. Figured, hell, maybe $400 is my lucky number. Hopefully I don't bounce again.  
  
tl;dr: I know your feels, bro/lady-friend.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:28:20
Wow. That blows. Glad I received the sorting out I did this morning. So nothing went through? Everything was pending then you cancelled? No overdraft fees? No losses? No gains? You went back to 0 unscathed and brought your business elsewhere?
