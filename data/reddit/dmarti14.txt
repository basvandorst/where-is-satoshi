Everyone should help each other if possible. 
I used this accelerator and it worked for me. Worth a shot. I was in a similar situation with a small amount of coin and it wasn’t until I saw a comment from a helpful redditor I was able to relax. Tx went through 30 mins later.

Yes trading is immediate. I was waiting to transfer to buy some more alts. Sorry if I was unclear folks!

Agreed. So much information. You guys rock. I apologize on behalf of my fellow newcomers who choose to ask the same questions over and over again.

Mine took like 5 days I think. It was excruciating.

Btc has this awesome feature where you can own like a piece of it. 
So picture you had a full apple pie. You could split it into smaller pieces. Let’s call those slices. You could then sell one slice at a time. So if the pie cost you 10 bucks, you could actually sell 10 smaller portions (slices) for $1 each. 
Proof below. 
10 USD /10 Slices(s)  = 1 usd/s 
1 USD/s * 10 s = 10 USD

That's so awesome! I just got in a week or so ago but just with some play around money. I've made ten bucks then lost 5 then made it back. My priority is throwing some spare change in and maybe getting a leg up on a ring for my girl down the line. I think I'll always have something in now that I have learned so much though.  
I'm worried about everyone heading in to be a quick millionaire. I have a bad feeling that way lies madness.

Yeah I tried at like 1:30 and it said try at the top of the hour. Then I tried at right 5 seconds after it changed from 1:59-2:00 and it worked. I really didnt expect it to but it did. Hope it works for others

I joined Gemini a few weeks back. Took a couple days to verify I think. Took like 5 days for funds to be cleared. They had high traffic due to the bitcoin explosion in price. Just posting as a reference point I thought might help some curious people. I know I was wondering an estimate when I was going through it 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:37:25
Haha yeah no shot. I love the girl but I’m not insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:37:55
Not yet

My personal moon is at 35k. If I could just squeeze out a bit more I can finally buy the engagement ring I’ve had my eye on. I’ll be leaving a bit in btc and some alts/buying more with every paycheck but that will be a milestone I can’t leave alone at this point in my life. I love this girl, we’ve been together for 7 amazing years and I want to buy her a ring with bitcoin!
