It's much easier to go from .005 to 1.00 than to go from 15k to 100k. 
Further, I can do that much faster with alts than waiting for years for BTC to maybe hit 100k. 
Even further the tech behind alot of alts really shows BTC's age. I have mad respect for it paving the way but there's just too much superior technology out there right now.

Learn about the top 10, the top 5 will be the most stable and least risky investments. 
The further down the list you go, the more risky the investment, but greater the risk, greater the reward. Check out some of the coins I recommended. If you like l one of them, find their subreddit and website and learn as much as you can about them.
Then decide if you think it will rise in value.

Whatever, people are just mad because they didn't get inside info to base their precious day trades on. 
The nature of the crypto market right now is that it's unpredictable with crazy swings. People calling full on boycotts over this is ridiculous. 
They added a coin to coinbase, good for them. They're not responsible for the affect it has on the market.

They did, it's called bch.

I'm not saying it was the only use. It's just the only reason I knew about it or cared to learn about what it was. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 18:07:37
I knew about about it in 09.
I regret not getting any at the time. At the time it was just a way to buy questionable things online. I didn't see it as an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:13
Not giving a big announcement about adding bch? I don't think that'll stand up in court.

Another vote for binance, they seem to have what I want and have been great to me thus far.

You could like at LTC eth or any other top 5 coin to be honest. It really depends on how much risk you're willing to take. For something safer stay in the top 5-10. If you'd like to take your chances at making a huge profit, bet on something young that you think has alot of potential. 
Iota, TRX, OMG, xrb, req,  xvg, icx, Mana, req. 
If you wanna play it safer, split it up between BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, and either dash or xmr

I'm about to sub to this doge sub. I've been pretty interested in bitcoin for a while but it's pretty inaccessible to noobs like myself. How can I start trading and mining dogecoins?

Could you tell me how I would collect these reddit tips into my wallet on my Android?

Why pay interest and go into debt on a risky investment? 
Just save it up then buy your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:32:35
I really would not suggest investing in something you don't believe in let alone understand.
Why would you willingly through your money into something that makes no sense to you? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:50:41
In that case, next best time would be now.

Move your btc from your exchange to a wallet of your choosing.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:03:11
I don't think this is something that has anything to do with BTC.
Am I upset that people are getting rich off BTC? No, why would I be. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:17:07
Because they believe in BTC and they don't believe in B2X.

Your best bet is buy and hold. If you're set on mining, mine something else like vertcoin.
