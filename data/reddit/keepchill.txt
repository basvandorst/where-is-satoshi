more like altcoins waiting for decentralized exchanges so the price isn't controlled by the dying bitcoin.

you're all worried about competition from other coins when it's impending government regulation you should be worried about. Bitcoin is robbing the US government of billions and they have had enough of that. Economics don't matter and these men don't play fair. They are going to take what they want and if you don't think they have the power to absolutey destroy bitcoin, you're kidding yourself.

You are far from the only one a little salty. I know literally hundreds of stories just like yours. I've said this before, but I think "bitcoin depression" could be a very real thing in the near future. Shit, I feel it everyday. Everyday I live with the reality that it was once at a coinflip decision and I made the wrong one that cost me hundreds of thousands at the risk of a few dollars. And I get the whole, "you would have sold already" argument, but honestly, I probably would not have. If I had invested, I always planned to just kind of forget about it and let it sit.

That is absolutely the plan. I am looking at it no different than gamlbing, just maybe a little better risk/reward than a casino.

But majority votes usually stay common. There are trends. The majority sentiment has changed, not just a few opinions.

This sort of volatility is becoming very scary. Not sure why you're all excited about this. I'd much rather see a slow and steady gain then hopping around from 15-18k in a matter of hours.

I'm researching what to buy and how to buy it right now. My GF and I talked about it last night and we are investing in digital currency. I have a personal theory that there will be 3 main forms of digital currency when it is all said and done. Huge things always end up in 3's. I think bitcoin and ethereum have all but secured the top 2 spots, and now I'd like to try and find the next bitcoin in  We're ok enough that I'm not trying to slowly grow an investment portfolio through digital currency. I'm just trying to find the next one with skyrocketing growth. It could still be bitcoin going to 200,000k, I know that, and please don't take any of this as anything but random guesses. I have no clue what I'm really talking about.

this sub is so confusing. One day it's bitcoin is the next coming of jesus, the next is bail out ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:09:21
oh absolutely. Most people would say you're insane not to cash out at 40x growth.

There was at time around 5 years ago I could have bought bitcoin for 30 cents and now it's $16,700. No other stock in history has compared. Not even close. I sat at a computer and watched a friend do it and he is now a multimillionaire.

A new account trying to spread FUD, that's adorable.

great, a 150% rally would only put me 25% down what I bought from.

You saw a movie, welcome back to reality where governments aren't the least bit afraid of people and it's actually just rich people that run everything. Bitcoin is crashing because "government" snapped their fingers and [decided it should crash.](

My math may be a bit exaggerated, and I'm actually not really invested in Bitcoin at all, I'm Diversified throughout the entire market so I was really speaking more about the market cap in general.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:00:19
as I said in my other comment, it wasn't exact, but you also were in a $17k or over period for 6 days straight, so I wouldn't exactly call it really unlucky.

welp, we all appreciate someone from the biz coming to tell us how we're idiots. You definitely don't look at all like a douche bag trying to feel intelligent.
