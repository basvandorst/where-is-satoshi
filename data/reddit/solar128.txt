It's a trick traders do regarding announcements... for example, say an alt is releasing a new wallet... they load up beforehand, and then sell right when the wallet is launched. It's dumb but many do it so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's so bad that sometimes you'll see the price tank days before a release as people try to be the first to sell the news.

Btcsuite, an alternate bitcoin node implementation, did not suffer from the bug.

@_date: 2018-09-25 02:34:07
Reminder that btcsuite, a non-Core implementation of bitcoin node, is not vulnerable to the bug.

Decred (featured in the research report) is a legit alternative to Bitcoin.
Monero is exciting but I think their anti-ASIC stance will be it's downfall. They are surrendering the ability to defend the network.

ASIC resistance is a buzzword and a pipe dream, but miner centralization is not. Giving users on-chain power to counterbalance miners is the solution. Implementing hybrid PoW/PoS would increase the cost to attack bitcoin by an order of magnitude:

Are you referring to miners signalling?
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:02:28
No need to be rude.
I asked for clarification because miners signalling does *not* seem like functional on-chain governance to me. Functional on-chain governance would include *binding* signalling primarily from the users (coin holders), not the miners. If you want a miner dominated bitcoin, well Jihan &amp; Roger have a fork for you ; )
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:02:58
This. Mass astroturfing on both sides is not functional governance. Wearing hats on twitter profile pics is not an effective way of reaching consensus.
On-chain governance is the only way to make decision making sybill-resistant.

If BTC can't survive Bcash, then how is it supposed to survive bigger challenges in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:28:23
If you think miners should not have 100% control of the currency, check out Decred. Basically bitcoin (21 million fixed cap) with a PoS system on top. Stakers have to give blocks the "seal of approval". Hard forks are also decided by currency users rather than miners, making a bitcoin cash scenario impossible.

Thank you. Why is this comment all the way at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:35:29
 is decent

Yes, binance, the home of luxury car giveaway "trading competitions" (outsourced wash trading) for gems such as Tron and Hshare, is the exemplar of integrity.

I'm saying what if Robinhood or Bitcoin IRA never touches a single bitcoin?
Since you have no ability to withdraw/deposit , it might as well be what they are doing.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:09:35
It's possible they aren't buying any bitcoin at all
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:17:13


Oh you sweet summer child...
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:29:58
What's the point of a bitcoin ETF if you aren't actually in possession of the crypto?
Reminds me of that bitcoinIRA bullshit. You're never actually in possession of the bitcoin. They might as well be not buying any bitcoin at all, it could be a fractional reserve scam or something for all we know.
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:17:00
The problem with shit like Robinhood or BitcoinIRA is it won't move the price one sat if the companies involved aren't actually touching bitcoin. It seems like they're currently just tracking the price.

I know a couple Cubans who would offer a different opinion. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:59:41
I first learned about bitcoin when it was $6... Almost bought a couple $100 worth but the exchange seemed sketchy... Several years later... Doh.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:56:40
If it's just tracking the price, then there's no bitcoin actually being bought or sold, is there?
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:20:15
If only there was a cryptocurrency like bitcoin but with a resilient governance mechanism...
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:38:10
Bittrex and Bitfinex are different exchanges.

Ethereum will probably end up copying the Decred system
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:01:29
Hybrid PoW/PoS can be the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:24:05
They charge 6 to 7 figures for new coin listings.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:05:58
I don't think it's very good. No mention of any of the projects experimenting with PoS after PeerCoin. Seems like an Ethereum shill piece.

Decred ASICs have been getting delivered.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:17:51
Check out Decred, hybrid PoW/PoS, allows users to punish misbehaving miners, made by the folks who wrote btcsuite (alt bitcoin node implementation)

My theory: They don't actually have much btc on hand and are preventing people from buying the dip with the fiat in their wallet. I've been planning on doing this for a few days and it's very frustrating to have the service be down when I want to buy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:42:00
My speculation: They don't actually have that much btc on hand. I wanted to buy the dip with the fiat in my account and reinvest it into alts. I am sure I am not the only one. They probably don't have enough btc on hand so they shut it down. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me this week so I am going to take my business elsewhere.
