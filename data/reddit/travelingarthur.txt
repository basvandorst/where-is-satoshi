1. Bitcoin isn’t anonymous. Your record of transferring  stays on that ledger. I know your wallet, I know your life 
2. Slow AF 5 TPS on chain. If the reality adopted Bitcoin in its purest sense, you’d wait in line for 1-30 minutes waiting for your transaction to finally take
3. Easily manipulated. Tether prints $1.4 Billion Fake Money and price jumps 300%. Tether doesn’t do anything for 2 weeks and prices falls 10%
4. Gold is a hedge. I.e put $200 in gold and expect it to be $200 worth of spending power in 10 years. Over 77 years $114.74 in gold equates to $4200 today. $115 77 years ago has roughly $2000 worth of spending value in today’s. That’s a hedge. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. That’s not a hedge 
5. Don’t know how P2P it is when 87% of the volume is done from an exchange nor is it really decentralized when 1% of the wallets own over 95% of Bitcoin 
6. Hard to bank the unbanked when you need a bank to get crypto from an exchange and majority of the unbanked won’t set up a mining service
Bitcoin is only good for extreme transparency and cross boarder payments. It fails in every other regard

I realize you have the ability to deposit on some of your assets, but not all. Just curious, why this is the case?

Since Abra has Neo, are the any plans to add VeChain?

So essentially...it’s a lot of work and the feature can’t be added by (theoretically speaking) a flip of a switch. Got it. Thanks
