Yes I know- It was never put on Reddit even though other releases were

That was a spontaneous video but it was fun and I might just do that! :)

I'm very sorry for the late response- I do have a list of "online" countries- I am waiting on a response from Alan Safahi (I report to him) with a response to your questions, as I am pretty sure that he has a better answer than I to all of them! 
I will keep you updated, as soon as I have an answer I will post here. Probably within the next 24 hours! Again, apologies for not responding sooner...

Did you get a chance to read Alan's responses? He posted them personally

If you enjoyed the acappella broadway piece then great, but that one was made much earlier...

This was meant as a thought-vomit- not necessarily a presentation :) Thanks for the feedback though, I intend to have a more professional layout and presentation style when I tackle Bitcoin in developing countries and payments infrastructure in Africa!

Hello, 
If you have had a bad experience, you are welcome to submit a formal complaint to myself or another member of the team. If you are asking about money transmitting licensing, I am sure I can clarify with our Risk and Regulation Exec. Claire Roberts. 
If you are complaining about ZipZap stealing your business model, then I am obliged to remind you that the payments industry hardly has IPR over any model, since there has been little to no innovation in (standard) payments in decades. ZipZap is operating on a business model much like many in the space- ZipZap is just doing it marginally better than others. This is the basis of Schumpeter's Economics of Innovation papers- social Darwinism in a business context, if you will. 
Yes, Brian is a brilliant tech guy. But the rest of the executive team and other members are gifted and dedicated to the mission of innovation within payments and bringing this innovation to developing countries and existing "developed" markets. 
Again, if you have a formal complaint, you should direct it towards myself or another member of the team, so that we can be constructive in criticisms rather than partaking in this tedious and petty mud-slinging online. 
ZipZap has a business model that has proven viable and obviously worth investing in. 
ZipZap, Inc. Social Media Intern and Research Assistant

Is he ever going to comment...? or validate?

I like the pictoral analogy... but even that explosion led to further innovation ;)
