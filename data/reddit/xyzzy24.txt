that area (not a single publication of the alleged group of “200” is listed, let alone information sufficient to assess the seriousness or depth of such articles). Of course, not all consultants are experts. In contrast, Bellovin’s curriculum vitae suggests that he has considerable expertise in cybersecurity. 
He was precluded because of procedure, plain and simple. Maybe she would recognize his expertise if the defense bothered to list his articles and show his work in the field. He'd still be precluded because of the tardiness of the disclosure, lack of opinion, lack of description of methodology, etc.

the reason why andreas was precluded from testifying was because the defense chose not to disclose any details about his testimony, as is required for every expert witness in every federal trial ever. The judge opinion about andreas lack of credentials was based on the fact that the only thing provided by the defense about his credentials was a crappy cv. 
Basically, the defense tried to call up andreas (and bellamy) as an expert witness in the 11th hour, without disclosing exactly what he would say, why his testimony is relevant to the case in hand or providing evidence showing why he is an expert in the field.
Dratel is an expert federal criminal attorney, so this was probably done on purpose, to earn ~~cookie~~ appeal points, and thats why the judge wrote [a very detailed ~~smackdown~~ ruling about these preclusions.](

Not so fast. There's a friction cost when exchanging R$ to BTC, another when converting BTC to R$ and fees in every step of the way.

    Your post advocates a
    
    ( ) technical ( ) legislative (X) market-based ( ) vigilante
    
    approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your 
    particular idea, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)
    
    ( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses
    (X) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
    ( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money
    ( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks
    ( ) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
    (X) Users of email will not put up with it
    ( ) Microsoft will not put up with it
    ( ) The police will not put up with it
    ( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers
    (X) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once
    (X) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers
    ( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
    ( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
    
    Specifically, your plan fails to account for
    
    ( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
    (X) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
    ( ) Open relays in foreign countries
    ( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
    ( ) Asshats
    ( ) Jurisdictional problems
    (X) Unpopularity of weird new taxes
    (X) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money
    (X) Huge existing software investment in SMTP
    (X) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack
    ( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email
    ( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes
    ( ) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches
    (X) Extreme profitability of spam
    ( ) Joe jobs and/or identity theft
    ( ) Technically illiterate politicians
    ( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
    ( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
    ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
    ( ) Outlook
    
    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    
    ( ) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    ( ) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    (X) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    (X) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    (X) Sending email should be free
    ( ) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough
    
    Furthermore, this is what I think about you:
    
    ( ) Sorry dude, but I don't think it would work.
    (X) This is a stupid idea, and you're a stupid person for suggesting it.
    ( ) Nice try, assh0le! I'm going to find out where you live and burn your house down!

You are missing a couple of steps there. Here's the full procedure:
* Physically fetching a pen in the office desk.
* Physically walking from the office to the living room.
* Physically picking up the envelope and putting it on the table.
* Physically removing the cap from the pen.
* Physically writing the return address on the envelope.
* Physically putting the cap back on the pen.
* Paying 37 cents for postage and in my case going to the store to buy stamps.
* Phisically walking back home from the store.
* Phisically licking the back of the stamp and affixing it to the envelope.
* Walking all the way to the office to fecth the checkbook
* Opening the top desk drawer where the checkbook is located.
* Picking up the checkbook.
* Closing the drawer.
* Walk all the way back to the living room where the envelope is located.
* Physically removing the cap from the pen (Again! See how inneficient this process is!)
* Writing a check.
* Physically putting the cap back on the pen.
* Putting the check inside the envelope.
* Closing the envelope.
* Going to a mailbox, dropping off the letter.
This is just to mail the envelope! The waiting procedure involves 3 meals a day and lot's of sleeping, so I'd run out of room in just this comment. But you got the idea.

the evidence in the murder for hire case is this:
* chat logs in Ross' laptop containing his conversation with the would be hitman, discussing the hit and arranging for conditions, payment etc.
* chat logs in Ross' laptop containing his conversation with one of his Silk Road employees, where he extensively talks about hiring a hitman. this conversation occured concurrently with the hitman conversation and includes some details about the transaction.
* the hitman in question was actually a federal agent, so the feds have his side of the conversation too.
* ross' deal with the hitman probably was also logged in the silk road servers (there is mention of this in one of the pre-trial communications between the federal prosecutor and the ny judge).
* ross paid the federal agent hitman by wiring money to him. twice. the feds tracked this transactions and linked both of them to ross' personal bank account in australia.
the evidence is pretty compelling, and damning. the feds probably have more, including evidence for the other 5 hits he ordered, but the evidence would only be public if the maryland case goes to trial.
Anyway, it seems like the case would be open and shut, if not for the fact that the federal agent who was the hitman was CARL MARK FORCE IV, one of the corrupt federal agents who extorted money from ross and stole a bunch of silk road bitcoins. A corrupt cop makes an awful witness for the prosecution, so the feds are probably waiting on the silk road NY case sentencing (and the resolution of the CARL MARK FORCE THE FOURTH criminal complaint) before moving forward with the Maryland murder for hire case.

on that same document, on the footnote of page 28 of 121, the federal prosecutor discloses that they have communications between CARL MARK FORCE IV and Ross that were acquired both from his laptop and the SR server.

The conspiracy crime does not merge with the substantive offense, so can be charged separately from the substantive offense.
If the federal prosecuters want, he can be charged in the future for those 5 hits. 
He probably will not because apparently this would be a tough sell to a jury. The evidence of these hits are a bunch of torchat logs of him negotiating with the would-be killers and the correspondent bitcoin transactions in the same dates and values as mentioned in these chats. 
The only hit the feds have hard evidence against ross is the one that involves CARL MARK FORCE IV, and these charges will probably be dropped because of the whole corruption thing, specially if ross gets a life sentence next friday.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:30:53
probably real. if he was fbi there would be 6 murders-for-hire in the maryland indictment instead of only 1.
@_date: 2015-05-27 02:00:54
there's a thing called chain of custody, and federal agencies take it very seriously in their criminal investigations. 
For instance, the logs were obtained in Ross' laptop, which was aprehended by a New York FBI taskforce agent. 
CARL MARK FORCE THE FOURTH was a Baltimore-based DEA agent, and wasn't involved in the laptop or the server seizure. The other corrupt agent was Bridges, a secret service agent also part of the Baltimore taskforce. 
Obviously, if you think that every single government agent is corrupt and out there to nail ross, then i suppose there will never be enough evidence of ross guilt.

That seems to be a frequent issue with people defending bitcoin. 
Remission is a highly regulated activity anywhere in the world. It's illegal in the vast majority of the world to send or receive money from abroad without filing the proper paperwork.
If you consider bitcoin to be an asset instead of a currency, then in the vast majority of the world receiving bitcoin would be considered a import, and you'd have to declare it to customs, and pay the proper taxes.
Part of the reason why western union (and other money transmitters) have so many fees is because they have all the licences required, already figured out the proper forms that have to be filled, pay up all the fees and taxes that must be paid, so that when you send money abroad through Western Union, not only you know for sure that the amount you sent will reach the proper destinatary, but also that neither you nor the person receiving the money are commiting any felonies or breaking any laws, and that all the proper taxes were paid.

I'd still say that is not entrapment, because there's a disconnect between those two steps (stealing the money and offering the hit). One could argue that the person had a predisposition to murder people who stole from him, or something like that. But certainly the governement would look bad to the jury in that case, and a case like this would probably be settled before trial.
In the specific case of ross, CARL MARK FORCE IV was not acting on behalf of the government when he stole the money. Also, the way he presented himself to ross and took the hit order would probably not be considered inductment (for I presume there is a specific procedure followed by undercover DEA agents exactly to avoid entrapment). Finally, and i might be wrong here because my memory falters, but i think ross was already discussing the possibility of killing his employee with another admin, so it could be argued that he had a predisposition for hiring a hitman and he'd have ordered a hit on green regardless of the opportunity presented by the federal agent. So **in my opinion** ross was not entraped
But it still looks really bad for the prosecution, and that's probably why they are not going forward with the maryland indictment. 
Also, entrapment is an affirmative defense and usually a jury question, so it's hard to say a. what would the jury think abouth this case and b. if ross would be willing to submit an entrapment defense and thus admit soliciting the murder for hires in the court of public opinion.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:28:40
Given that the hits were included as overt acts of the count 3 - narcotics conspiracy, and that ross was considered guilty of said count, you can say that yes, the jury found ross guilty of those 5 instances of murder for hire.
if what was presented was not proof enough to convice you, well, thats your prerogative.

Dratel is a harvard graduate who became famous for defending some high profile terrorism cases. He managed to get an astralian taliban fighter out of guantanamo and got him a plea deal of just 7 years, later reduced to only 9 months of prison.
He's definetly not a bad lawyer, he just got dealt a crappy hand. Maybe he recommended a guilty plea and ross refused to listen. And anyway, this case is not over. In fact, considering everything, anything less than natural life is probably a victory for ross.
@_date: 2015-05-28 00:06:07
yeah, everything was linked to the DRP account in the silk road. 
Prosecution managed to link DPR to ross by crossreferencing the DPR account in the silk road server, the log.txt found in ross laptop, ross's gmail and facebook accounts and the FBI physical surveilance of Ross.
The defense claimed that ross created silk road, left it during 2011, and was lured back by the real DPR in 2013, just in time to be framed and arrested. This allegations were not proved, and the DPR/Ross link presented by the prosecution was never properly contested.
But yeah, the defense never argued against the hits because it claimed that Ross was not DPR when the hits were ordered.
Also, the evidence for the hits could have been contested without compromising the defense thesis, if they managed to prove that the logs, torchats, bitcoin transfers, etc were false/forged/planted. But they never did...

What does the USSG have to do with the exclusion of the evidence regarding agent CARL MARK FORCE IV from the trial?
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:23:53
The only logical reason for the defense actions in this trial is that they were gunning for a mistrial or trying to score "appeal points". 
They did not call any experts to counter the laptop/server evidence, choosing to try to make their points during the cross examination of the prosecution expert witnesses (which is not allowed).
Then they decided way too late to call in a computer and a bitcoin expert and even then they failed to provide the proper paperwork to include them, so they were precluded from testifying.
with no expert witnesses and with ross choosing not to take the stand, the defense consisted basically in character witnesses testifying about how peaceful and non-violent ross was, and his counsel's opening and closing arguments about how the internet is a mysterious place where strange things can happen, like how a bunch of silk road files and tor chats logs can randomly appear in a laptop memory due to a power surge, and that the person who framed ross could have dictated the silk road notes found in his apartment trash by phone.
Dratel failed to contest the vast majority of the prosecution case, and it was not a surprise that the jury took only 4 hours (including a lunch break) to find ross guilty of all seven charges.

So, as the prosecutor's letter mentions, it is a fact that the murder for hire charges were included in the superseding indictment filed in august of 2014 (at least 5 months before the trial) as an overt act of Count 3 - Narcotics Trafficking Conspiracy.
And before you ask, those are the other 5 hits that he ordered. The CARL MARK FORCE IV hit is not included there, because the prosecution was careful to exclude everything that involved CARL MARK FORCE IV from this indictment.

In that light, the defense did what it could: avoid presenting expert evidence, fuck up some rules on purpose to make the judge make some rulings against him, play the government conspiracy card and try to score as many appeal points as possible.

You are correct in stating that the maryland murder for hire charges cannot be taken in consideration for the sentencing because evidence for them was not presented in the trial. 
But the logs where ross negotiated for some of the other hits were submitted as evidence in the trial and the defense was free to contest them and present counter evidence. Why that didn't happen can only be answered by the defense counsel.
And this things totally should be taken in consideration during sentencing. For the same reason the defense is able to present a bunch of letters from ross family and friends, claiming that he's a good boy and asking for leniency.
As for a new trial, the first one was a blast, and I was rooting for the retrial appeal to be granted, so that there would be a do-over of that comedy clusterfuck and dratel could elaborate on how mark karpeles managed to insert mycrimes.txt inside ross laptop using a breaking bad torrent.

Ok, this is where you are wrong. Ross ordered 6 hits. CARL MARK FORCE IV was the hitmen (hitman? help!) in one of them. The other 5 did not involve him.
The NY superseing indictment was careful to exclude the 1 hit that involved CARL MARK FORCE IV, and mentions only the other 5 where he was not involved.
So, again, the murder-for-hire was mentioned in the original NY indictment, and ross defense could have contested these allegations during trial if they bothered to. Also, the hits included in the indictment did not involved CARL MARK FORCE IV at all.
Even if they were not mentioned in the trial, the USSG allows for other relevant conduct, charged or not, to be considered during sentencing.

they did it because it was an open and shut case, and pleading not guilty would only postpone the inevitable, plus lose any goodwill points they can get by pleading guilty.

so yeah, he'll get whatever the judge decides, according to the federal sentencing guidelines, which are quite complex. As far as we know, he might get 20 years, but probably less, because he took a plea, and that counts.

    (2013-01-27 01:20) cimon: Dude, he was a CSR that could read PMs, reset passwords, mebbe harvest addys while emptying accounts, etc., etc. He was smart enough to impersonate gooly-dick, take nob for some marching powder, and all with yer assistance. 
    (2013-01-27 01:20) cimon: yeah, and chat logs
    (2013-01-27 01:21) cimon: So, you've had your time to think. You're sitting in the big chair, and you need to make a decision. Now, really, things could move fast in the future.
    (2013-01-27 01:21) myself: I would have no problem wasting this guy
    (2013-01-27 01:21) cimon: Well ok then, I'll take care of it.
    (2013-01-27 01:22) myself: do you mind keeping me abreast
    (2013-01-27 01:22) cimon: So, other than that, how's your weekend going? 
    (2013-01-27 01:23) myself: it's good 
So yeah, the murder thing was proposed by his mentor, who as far as we know was not cop, but even if he was a cop, ross jumped right into it without second thoughts. it took a whooping 5 minutes for him to decide he was ok with "wasting this guy".
the following afternoon he talks to "Nob", who is actually SPECIAL AGENT CARL MARK FORCE THE FOURTH, about the hit. again, "myself" is DPR/ross.:
    (2013-01-27 15:16) Nob: as we discussed, I reached out and I have two very, professional individuals that are going to visit green
    (2013-01-27 15:16) myself: will they execute him if I want?
    (2013-01-27 15:17) Nob: they are very good; yes, but I directed them only to beat him up; that was your wishes yesterday, correct?
    (2013-01-27 15:19) myself: yes it was
    (2013-01-27 15:19) myself: will you be in contact with them when they get there?
    (2013-01-27 15:19) Nob: no, no contact; too risky
    (2013-01-27 15:19) myself: ok, so the plan is in motion then?
    (2013-01-27 15:20) myself: for them to give him the note and beat him up?
    (2013-01-27 15:20) Nob: yes, they have your note and are going to, how do I say it, torture him
    (2013-01-27 15:20) myself: ok, hmmm
    (2013-01-27 15:21) Nob: i am paying for this one, but if you want him killed it will be a lot more and you will have to pay the difference
    (2013-01-27 15:21) myself: do they know he was arrested for coke 10 days ago?
    (2013-01-27 15:22) Nob: no the details; they work for an associate of mine; i have never met them
    (2013-01-27 15:22) myself: ok
    (2013-01-27 15:23) Nob: do you know what happened? what are the details of his arrest
    (2013-01-27 15:23) myself: I don't know, but I assume it was your key because it happend right around the same time
    (2013-01-27 15:24) Nob: this is why I shouldn't mail; everybody want's them in the mail
    (2013-01-27 15:25) myself: yea, larger stuff is better to do drops
    (2013-01-27 15:25) Nob: too risky, not damned methylone and other shit
    (2013-01-27 15:25) myself: ok, so can you change the order to execute rather than torture?
    (2013-01-27 15:26) myself: he was on the inside for a while, and now that he's been arrested, I'm afraid he'll give up info
    (2013-01-27 15:26) Nob: yes, is that what you want?
    (2013-01-27 15:26) myself: and he ripped me off
    (2013-01-27 15:26) myself: it is, after i had a chance to think on it
    (2013-01-27 15:26) myself: never killed a man or had one killed before, but it is the right move in this case.
    (2013-01-27 15:27) myself: how much will it cost?
    (2013-01-27 15:27) Nob: ok, I was going to pay $5,000 to have him beat up; I need to contact my associate and ask what the price will be for the deed
    (2013-01-27 15:27) myself: ok
    (2013-01-27 15:28) myself: ballpark?
    (2013-01-27 15:28) Nob: i have no idea what it will cost
    (2013-01-27 15:28) myself: ok
    (2013-01-27 15:28) myself: less than $100k?
    (2013-01-27 15:29) Nob: depends, they need to check out the neighborhood, police force, etc.
    (2013-01-27 15:29) myself: ok, so you'll let me know
    (2013-01-27 15:29) myself: ?
    (2013-01-27 15:30) Nob: yes, give them a couple days to assess the situation and I will have a price for you
    (2013-01-27 15:30) myself: thank you 
so yeah, the reason for ordering the hits was a federal agent stealing 350k from him and the original suggestion of murder might (only might, becasue we have no clue about cimon/VJ identity) have come from a cop, but ross did not show any sort of resistence to the though of commiting that crime. on contraire, he came to terms quite fast, and was more worried about how much it would cost him.
[that's not entrapment](

the official border was defined by the river, and the river course changed since then. 
Croatia says that the border is the current course of the river, Serbia says that the border is the line where the river used to be hundreds of years ago, so everything inbetween the river and that line is not recognized by anyone.
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:34:18
actually no, the way it was done makes the most sense. 
the drug charges only need proof that ross is DPR to stick
the murder for hire charges need proof that ross is DPR, plus additional evidence for the murder for hire part
therefore, its only logical that they did the drug charges first.

@_date: 2015-04-01 18:05:00
yup, thats the correct timeline. 
In january 2013, ross paid 80k to "Nob" (who was in fact SPECIAL AGENT CARL MARK FORCE THE FOURTH) for the murder of Curtis Green, aka "Flush", who was a former silk road admin who was arrested and turned by the baltimore taskforce.
In march 2013, ross was being blackmailed by a vendor named "FriendlyChemist", so he paid 150k to another person called "redandwhite" to kill "FriendlyChemist". In the logs, he complains that not long ago he paid 80k for a clean hit.
This was the hit that was mentioned in the NY criminal complaint, but only in the background section, he was not charged for any murder for hire crimes in NY. 
As far as we know, these guys were not federal agents, and from the looks of things they were probably the same person, and ross was scammed.

The server was seized in iceland. Its not illegal to seize a crime related server overseas, unless the owner is an american citizen and claims the 4th. 
The government does not need to prove that the shit they seize dont belong to an us citizen. Ross was given the opportunity to claim ownership of the server and refused. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:37:13
in your hipotetical case where the cop is a home invader who is threatening the guy's family, yeah, that'd probably be considered entrapment.
in the prostitution case, if after disclosing that she wants money the guy still wants to pay, that's not entrapment. johns can always say no to the proposition and leave the room.
in DPR/ross's case, the guy was neither threatening nor blackmailing DPR. cirrus literaly said "hey, this guy knows a lot of stuff,b maybe he'll rat you out, if i were you i'd kill him", and ross quickly agreed.
if cirrus was a cop (and again, we don't know that), then maybe DPR/ross would have a snowball's chance at the entrapment defense.

the thing is, croatia claims that the correct border is the course of the danube river hundreds of years ago, and they are claiming a bunch of serbian territory currently located on the east bank of the danube river. 
That specific piece of land is the largest piece of land under dispute that is located on the west bank, so in order to strenghten their claim to the east bank areas (which are much larger), croatia is "giving" serbia that area. 
Serbia on the other hand don't want to give a bunch of territory on the east bank of the danube to croatia, so they claim that that piece of land in the west bank is croatian.
there's zero chance a bunch of libertarian czechs are going to be able to form a new nation between croatia and serbia.

i know that in your eyes judge forrester is an evil pawn of the statist conspiracy to destroy ross life for the sake of the war on drugs or whatever, but let me quote something that she said during the trial:


and here's Dratel admitting that ross founded and operated the illicit drug market webte "the silk road" for a couple of months:


So, unless your argument is that during ross tenure as operator of the silk road there was no drug dealing happening on the site, it really doesn't matter if there were other silk road administrators, or if ross was being blackmailed, or if mark karpeles is actually a crooked DEA officer. 
ross was "DPR" (meaning the administrator of the silk road site) during a time when there were drug deals happening through that site, and that is enough to convict him.
Also, the crooked agents were involved in the murder for hire charges, and had nothing to do with the seizure and imaging of the silk road server or ross' laptop. in the end this line of argument is moot because the guy kept mycrimes.txt in his laptop right next to drugaccounting.xls, and the prosecuting managed to prove using that that ross was DPR the whole time.
as i said, the defense could have used the existence of ~~these crooked agents~~ **CARL MARK FORCE IV** in an attempt to discredit the federal agents that seized the laptop filled with evidence in the eyes of the jury, but that would still be a hail mary.
edit: corrected a typo.

the very first thing ross' defense claimed in their opening statements was that ross was DPR.
sure, the "evil cops are corrupt, dont belive the government" line of defense would be marginally better than the "karpeles did it though bittorrent" defense that they went with, but it would still be a hail mary, because the trial was about selling drugs, and ross even admitted being DPR during the time when drugs were being sold though silk road.

The maximum offense level is 43. He got 50. The -3 from the plea wouldnt make any difference. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 02:50:13
actually the prosecution charges him with the crimes it thinks it can get a guilty verdict. 
also, he was charged with money laundering, which is a pretty serious felony: 8 base points + 6 for laundering drug money + points plus bonus points for the amount of money involved, which should be 16 for the over 1 million he was charged with = 30 points. He got a net of 3 points knocked down as the sum of his adjustments, probably thanks to his plea deal. 
so, a small amount of money laundered (money laundry bonus points for the amount of money laundered goes up to 30 for over 400 millions), plus the plea deal means he got the 7 years per the guidelines. 
what other felonies do you wanted? theft is only 7 base points. extortion would be similar, 18 base points, which is 4 more than the 8+6 he started with in the money laundering, but the bonus points for the amount extorted would be about 12 or 14, so 30-32 points which is similar to the money laundering calculation. EDIT: also he was charged with “Extortion under color of official right”, not of "Extortion by Force or Threat of Injury or Serious Damage", so the above calculation does not apply.
he never used a gun. he never dealt with drugs. no minors, no terrorism, no sexual stuff, no physical violence, he was not part of a criminal organization. Obstruction of justice is +2 points and it was probably applied. on the other hand, the plea deal is -3 for accepting responsibility and saving the trouble of a trial. Finally, he only had a misdemeanor in his criminal record.
Here. [take a look at the USSG]( open an excel spreradsheets and try to get an offense level higher than 27 for whatever crimes you wish he was charged for.

still not how it works. if the counts are not grouped, only the highest scored group applies, and bonus points are added according to the offense level of the other groups, so laundering + extortion + conspiracy + terrorism + high treason would be just the highest offense level of the bunch +0-5 points depending on how the relative seriousness of the other charges.

If you read the maryland indictment, you'll find that he hired the undercover agent to torture his ex-employee because he stole funds from other silk road users. 
Later, he changed the order to execute because he was afraid that the ex-employee would give information to the police about silk road. 
At no point the empolyee he asked to be tortured and killed blackmailed him, or snitched him. 
Again, according to the maryland indictment, Ross, this beautiful flower of a person who is a hero of freedom and was only trying to bring peace to the world, tried to hire someone to torture and then execute his former employee over stolen funds and fear of being snitched.

[Just read the decision](
If the defense wanted his testimony to be accepted, they should have properly disclosed it, according to the rules. 
This has nothing to do if the guy is an expert or not. The defense tried to do some trial by ambush and got smacked down, simple as that. Maybe Dratel is going for some appeal points, or maybe he's just that incompetent.
Edit: TL;DR:


@_date: 2015-02-03 02:32:03


Just to clarify this point, this is wrong. That's not the reason the court blocked his testimony.
In a criminal trial, if you want an expert testimony, you have inform the court and the adversarial counsel why is this guy an expert, what exactly is he going to say, the metodology that he used to reach his conclusions, etc, so that the court can decide if his testimony is relevant to the trial and so the adversarial counsel can prepare for cross examination.
In this case, the judge blocked both defense experts because the defense failed to provide the required information, and did it after the start of the trial. 
The court cannot even determine if the defense expert's testimony would be relevant to the case or not because the defense never disclosed what they were supposed to say.
This is the real world, not a phoenix wright game. There are no secret last minute witnesses in real world criminal trials.

Ah, but your conspiracy theory fails to notice that the [original DPR indictment for the "murder for hire" charges]( was filled on May 1, 2013, 5 months before the arrest!
BTW, do you subscribe to the "Karpelès framed Ross by putting evidence in his laptop via bittorent" conspiracy theory, or do you go with the "disconnecting the ROM from a powersource randomly wrote the backup of silkroad and mycrimes.txt on Ross' laptop" line of crazyness?

lol, you are dumb because the 25% new tax is only for tourism, so if you are moving to mexico you'll probably open a bank account there, so you'd only pay .38% in IOF plus whatever fees and fx spread.
also lol if you think it's hard to move USD 60k around.
also lol if you think USD 60k in lifesavings is a lot of money.

the prosecution had a laptop containing:
* illegal_drug_marketplace_website.bkp
* fake_passaports_and_miscelanious_aliaces.pdf
* drug_market_accounting.xlsx
* secret_conversatons_with_felow_criminals.log
* my_daily_life_as_a_criminal_mastermind.docx
what plea deal?

OP, you are dumb, the 25% tax is only for paying for services abroad, you can buy whatever foreign currency in brazil paying only 0.38% IOF and leave the country with your wad of dollars/euros/dogecoins without paying any taxes.

Ok, fair enough. There might have been an open plea deal.

The mycrimes.txt file was not written by ross, but rather uploaded to his computer by mark karpeles via breaking bad torrent.
