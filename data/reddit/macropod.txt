Yes, they are both assets.  However, value is supply and demand.  Inflation is volume.  Of course they are connected, but not in the context you chose to explain. 
Your talks about competition are not related to this topic either. 
"Folks are currently treating e-coins as an investment/stock opportunity so they can sell it for a higher price later. But that would defeat the entire original purpose of using Bitcoin as actual currency."
Only if you're day trading. Otherwise, no it doesn't...
The fact that I can buy a currency that holds a variable value (like a stock or bond) instead of banking my cash so that banks can invest in a stock or bond means that crypto is very valuable! The fact that I can mine and earn dividends to compound my gains means that I have the power to grow personal capital and the banks do not.  Once again, that is value my friend! 
Not to mention, it's global, carries lower fees and there is a finite amount.

Value and Inflation are two completely different things.  You're not able to "print" more Bitcoin in response to supply &amp; demand. Bitcoin is more like an asset and the value is only determined by what individuals are willing to sell them for.  At this moment i'm willing to pay a lot of dollars for Bitcoin because I literally value it more than the US Dollar, which is given to the banks, who reinvest it for their own gains.

Okay my friend, whatever

Would you pay for a service if you own the miner and we host it?

Are you mining or are you not?  I purchased my first S9 and realized there was no way I could run it from the comfort of my own home.  Too loud, too hot and too much electricity.  We had to invest in a facility.  Like me, there are not a lot of people who can help support the mining network,  in their own houses. Therefore, instead of buying a miner and having to worry about its operation, they can pay for a service to support the mining network by having it run at our facility.  A 10% management fee for us to maintain, reboot and cool the miner is all we see in profit.  We also forego any investment in the coin.  From a business model standpoint, it helps us by increasing our up front cash flow to pay for utilities, which is why we have made cloud mining available as a product.  The word scam gets tossed around so much in crypto (for legitimate reasons), but people often forget that business models profit by providing value. If it does not provide value to you, you don’t buy it.  If it does offer value to you, then you do buy it.  That’s not how scams work.

Not in all instances, if the value goes back up, locking yourself in to a 1 year fixed contract is an absolute bargain to investors who did not purchase when the price was low.  Many other instances can be given

Well, that’s why we’re getting feed back.  You think 10% above our break even is an unfair margin for us to cover air conditioning, power and internet? It’s basically the same price as you buying an S9, paying for the power supply, cables and import taxes and then having someone else have to solve the noise and heat problems for you.

How would you structure a cloud mining service? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:10:11
Yeah, assuming the market is stable.  It’s not.  Also, if you used our calculator, electricity is already factored into the contract cost, so should be left at 0 when you use it.  You would get .48 BTC at 3k for one year at the current rate and difficulty.
Price goes up, miners win. Price goes down, it’s likely difficulty goes down as miners would shut off he hardware.  Those running contracts, would be earning &gt;.48 BTC in that instance.
