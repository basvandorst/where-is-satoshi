I think the big question here is "so what?"
That's the risk of taking an investment in a new technology, or anything.
I mean, it's the point of "investing": you, the capital-holder, shoulder the *risk* of the endeavour on the assumption it will pay off..  It's *good* that we still have *opportunities* to take risks and make something of ourselves, if we're willing to try.
Bitcoin is inherently a "libertarian" and "free market" idea, so I have no idea why what you're saying is a necessarily *bad* thing.
It's better than sealing everyone safely in bubble wrap.

First of all, nobody cares about there being a hard fork.  If this group wants to hard fork a new chain, they can.
The problem is that this new fork is not fully safe.  It is going to allow for replay attacks.
What this means is that the new chain, and the old chain, will be functionally similar.  Any transactions you issue to the Bitcoin network will also be valid for the B2X network - and vice versa.  Anybody can copy these transactions and simply replay them on the other network to wreak havoc on other people's coins.
Say you used your new low value B2X to buy a coffee.  You spent 0.2 B2X.
This gets replayed by a mischievous troll on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Suddenly, "CryptoCafe" just profited $700 for a coffee (since they own that address, too!)
Everybody should care that 2X isn't safe for activation in its current form, and could wreak havoc on *both* BTC and B2X blockchains.
This bull-headed move of Jihan Wu is sort of a "you can enable 2X or not, but we're going to do it and the whole thing will be fundamentally broken until you join us."
This isn't just an attack.  This is bitcoin being held hostage.

Yeah, if you subscribe to a world where the laws of physics don't count and throwing more electricity at it will make it go faster.

Yeah, I was *just* adding a note about how I expect transfers to be copied from network to network instantly...
Manual route does seem to necessitate a tool to ensure simultaneous transfer of coins on each network, and even then, no guarantee...
Urg.  This is frustrating.  Can you describe the time lock method, or know where you saw it?

At the same time, I thought the [empty NFL seats]( would've taught liberals that playing politics hasn't worked out for any other industry *but* politics.
Let's not piss on Bitcoin and alienate people, *especially* when Nick Szabo *himself* said that Bitcoin is inherently attractive to the capitalist-libertarian audience (you know, the audience that found a home under Trump's wing?)
You have a head.  It does more than hold up hats for you.  :)

You're sure good at playing dumb, then.


Ironically, you mean like the pedant I'm responding to?






If someone's going to be a pedantic ass (and demonstrably wrong) then I'm going to point it out.  There's enough misinformation here without the idiots "correcting" what's already correct by flipping words on their head. 
Sorry for the hurt in the rear!

"Math problem" means there would be a mathematical solution.
There isn't one.  There's an answer, but no way to solve for that answer.


Hence the brute force.  Don't be smarmy.

Honestly, it's likely to counter the common language of "these big names signed the NYA".

For those who might be confused, a common response to this is:
*"But what if the "shift them to another address" part gets replayed before the sale - and then the sale gets replayed!?"*
Here's how you secure your bitcoins when 2X comes:
Let's say you have Wallet A on both BTC and B2X.
* Wallet A (BTC)
* Wallet A (BTX)
Create two new wallets, one on each network: 
* Wallet B (BTC)
* Wallet C (B2X)
Simultaneously, on both networks, empty wallet A into the new (different) wallets that you made.
Confirm these transactions have been committed.  
You now have a replay-safe wallet on each network.  Wallet B now has your BTC coins on the BTC blockchain, and Wallet C (different address) now has your B2X coins on the B2X blockchain.
Spending transactions from Wallet B, if copied, will not affect Wallet C on the other network.

I mean it's nice that you're really trying this hard to turn an obvious sign-on list into "they're just listing people who didn't sign it."
If that's the case, explain why there is section of companies whose support of 2X is still in question. They appear to be transparent as to which companies they don't know the position of.
Evidently, they're doing their homework, and you just want to play linguistic games with the *just* the first sentence.

I'm not sure what kinda layman you're thinking of, but my idea of a layman can grasp "random guessing." ;)
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:46:09
Bait and switch is absolutely illegal (and almost universally so).
If they call it "bitcoin," charge you money for "bitcoin," and it's not on the standard blockchain that everybody *else* calls "bitcoin", then they've stolen your money and provided a counterfeit product.
That's what this is - a counterfeit product.  Tricking you to pay for one thing while giving you another.
It's not like "Bitcoin Cash" where the fork was trying to be something different and advertised *clearly* that it wasn't the same product as Bitcoin.
So, no, they don't have the "right" to do this in most countries around the world.

This isn't correct, but I'll run with it:  the problem is more aptly described as "trying to guess a password" than it is "solving a complex math problem."  In fact, the concept of randomly guessing a password until you get the correct one is *easier* to understand than trying to explain it as a "complex math problem" while refusing to explain any of the math behind it.
Saying, effectively, "just trust me, it's complicated math" simply doesn't engender the same understanding.
"Guessing" conveys everything *without* the layman inserting their misunderstandings of mathematics into the fray.
Now, the reason I said it's not correct is because of this:


This isn't right.  It's not any amount of "complexity" that makes it impossible.  It simply *is* impossible.  Just as I cannot mathematically solve for guessing a password, I can't mathematically solve for what produces a given hash.   It's called a "one-way" function for a reason.
What makes it impossible is that there are no steps to solve this problem.  It's not solvable.  No amount of complexity reduction would make it solvable by a computer.  You can find one of *many* answers that fit the problem, but you will not find the solution.
BTW Your ELI5 is great, *if you 're trying to explain how to "solve for x" in algebra.*  Other than that, it's useless.

Yeah, buying more miners gets you more hashing power.  Nobody's debating that.
I'm snarkily pointing out that ASICBOOST does not give any given unit "more hashing power" as OP suggested, trying to one-up the poster who said it doesn't.


(You *don't* get "extra hashing power" *out of* your miners.  You get *extra miners*.)
