Can I just ask what exactly the arrest was? Did they pull you over, knock on your door, what?

Watch out for anyone paying with bitcoin... I had an absolutely abysmal experience with tiger direct. I played for about $950 worth of parts with bitcoin. They use BitPay. I ended up cancelling that order. I was told by one customer service rep I would receive my refund in an American express gift card, since they couldn't refund bitcoin. OK, that's fine. Next customer rep tells me otherwise. Now I can only receive a store credit.... Horrible news, but fine. 
Rep tells me REFUND IS ON THE WAY, 3-5 business days.
1 week later, no refund. I contact customer service. "Yes, your refund is on the way."
I contact another rep. They forward me to a BitPay invoice which is incomplete, and tell me to manually change the invoice myself to send a refund request to bitpay. Its a pain, but I do it. I contact customer service. They don't know what BitPay invoice is, and I should speak to BitPay about it. 
 
Needless to say, I'm out $950 still. 2 and a half weeks after purchase. 
Be very very careful.

I had a horrible multibit experience. I had issues where my transactions would be subtracted from my balance, but never sent. So I was missing funds. I had to export my private keys to another wallet to "retrieve my funds". Never again.

Paper wallets are just as easy, and allow you to hold your own private keys in cold storage. Coinbase holds your coins in cold storage. If you'd like the same security as holding on coinbase, + control of your own coins, use them. Coinbase automates the process to be ridiculously easy as well.

Then I feel as if this article is in the wrong sub Reddit.

I've seen plenty of high end cars for sale on It definitely happens.

I'm so sorry... this is horrible man... 
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:02:34
Nah coinbase isn't a bitcoin trade exchange, it's really only a way to purchase bitcoin through ACH or credit cards. Don't use it for swing trading.

The people who would wish to ban it are sheep. Seriously, they probably no zero about the protocol besides what the mainstream media has told them. Either way, why ban it? I don't understand. Unless the banks are scared they would not feel the need to ban it.

Why anyone would store their coins directly on their phone is beyond me. With all the online wallets (I still believe in cold storage) you can use on your phone, why would you store them in a place they could easily be lost if you lost your phone?

The item was listed as "in stock", and after purchase they updated me saying it was on backorder, which would take 1 week or so before they even got it in, let alone do the packing and shipping process.

Very nice.

They didn't lose anything. They use bitpay, the BTC was converted to USD instantly. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:21:00
I've got to say, I had a nightmare with tiger direct + bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:54:37
They use a bitpay invoice system. You scan the bitpay QR code after selecting bitcoin as a payment system, and the invoice is paid almost instantly. As far as payment, it's a very good system. Refunds are much more cumbersome however.

a month or two ago. this was with a current version of multibit. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:08:36
Where does this article even mention anything about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:01:30
Well apparently this guy has received 0 bitcoin if you look his address up in the blockchain.

Watch out... take a look at their reviews... 1 star out of over 9000 reviews:

I was able to pick up a few at 530 on coinbase, died when I saw 102 on BTC-E

Damn. This long process is rough. Hope all the ATM's aren't like this.

Place contact information and we can make it happen. This is wrong.

This is a crypto only marketplace. Inactive so far because of a lack of users. Maybe it's time to fill it up!

Who owns this domain again? The website is absolutely terrible. Hope the owner sees this.
