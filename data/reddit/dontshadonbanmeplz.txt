any info from BFX CEO or he dissapiered ?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:56:34
they will buy btc with usd + buy btc with eth thats why the price of BTC is going up 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:50:42
Why ? Wouldnt 1 mil $ be enough for a lawyers ?
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:50:24
more, I was lending for ~ 15% per year
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:51:24
Its fair
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:38:20
I could do that for 1 mil :)
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:53:47
BFX should return usd in full otherwise FBI/jail etc. and go bankcrupt about BTC, give back as much as they have earned and havent spend and buy BTC for that and do small haircut
They can just operate as normal and lets say 50% of profits goes to "return fund". Withdrawal got a cut of 120/1800 for everyones BTC's and as time passes and fees are collected those account got some btc every day/week or so

additionaly exchanges arent safe, and ETF is insured (?)
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:37:26
Thats not true, it will last longer. However big blocks is wrong direction but be have to define big. 100 GB/year even today wouldnt be a huge problem for full nodes - and customers should use light clients. Full nodes as every customer is not possible way to achive too. Does we need more then 1000 full nodes worldwide ?
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:31:11
nope, if block is 80-90% full, then spamming is good tactic for miners (they fill 10-20% but those 80-90% pay 2x,3x higher fees
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:49:17
BTC is speculation more then real use. Price will move hard. If not approved retest 780-820 seems like natural thing, if approved 1160
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:52:58
can you short ETF with USD as collateral ?
@_date: 2017-02-06 11:38:59
all 4 exchanges dead ?
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:15:16
yes, thanks, but please do something with those fees.. (80% for segwig as vote of yes or promise to increase block size if SW isnt enough or LN/side channels etc. )
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:25:42
they are great guys for btc, thanks even if won't be approved !
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:48:26
Cant we just put transactions in order ? (I wanted to build alt like this but its too expensive for me)
I mean lets say fee/size is 50 (if block is full increase default fee 2x ). If I send transaction at 3:35 it is converted into bigger time stamp like 3:35:(0001) and it gets into block before 3:35:(5000). 
1 session will be 10 minutes. 0:00 - 9:30 will be taking transactions in real time. 9:31 - 9:55 - transations stops (goes into backlog) difficulty changes to 1 (from infinity). CPU nodes sends their block to each other - it should be the same as transactions are in order so we have consensus (by proof of nodes)
Additionaly we will gain 0-confirmationm and BTC transactions will be trully close to instant and decentralization as its super cheap to run full node)
If you could answer if thats stupid idea I would be very grateful.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:22:29
yes, thanks !
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:59:09
good for btc not so good for dash :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:14:38
ffs just upgrade that block size to that 2mb. Its small difference. Just do something like: if 80% nodes are signaling 2mb block, increase block to 2mb after XXXX blocks
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:31:03
is my electrum doing them ? or I need to update to new version or sth ?
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:22:52
today Ive send with default fee from poloniex to okcoin, took about 1,5h
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:16:28
same, I think after 800 we went straight up and we may go below 900 to retest some levels like 850 which was tested once
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:53:23
few months ago, about 2k btc and same or lower amount in fiat was stolen from polish exchange, ppl lost their lifetime savings and probably founders will go away with it.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:07:02
its too complicated, It have to be:
1. Open wallet
2. click "backup your BTC"
3. save file on some kind of device
It should be 100% safe. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:07:57
some photos would be nice :) 
gl with your project, love it !
@_date: 2016-12-04 11:37:19
hostile for btc, its like pool who helps spamers send bitcoin to themselves nearly for free. Imagine every pool works the same - blocks will be only the spam
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:46:40
I would for 1k and buy at market for 800-900 :P
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:50:55

Thanks !! :D
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:00:45
or it was hedge so he is up ~40$ per BTC so about +25000 $ but need to hold till the end and open new contract
@_date: 2016-11-16 23:54:30
how much volume ?
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:44:48
its not insured ? :O
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:59:58
Why we need so many past transactions ?
Why wont we do something like checkpoints and now only use blocks 350 000+ and do not download 0-349999. And do checkpoints every XXXXX blocks. We could manage disc space that way easily and could increase block size maybe even as high as 8mb now and more in the future as download/upload increases worldwide
not tech savy so simple explanation please :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:12:21
Ill buy those scripts for 251k ! 
@_date: 2016-12-21 22:43:14
those mor0ns cant check basic stuff like chinese volume
16m btc in circulation and 10m volume... yea right :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:51:33
how many ?
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:53:49
why they use them as corespondent bank then ?
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:47:46
yes they should have over 65 kk USD on TW bank to cover USDT as /u bfx_brandon . Could you confirm, please ?
@_date: 2016-09-30 18:49:40
they all should be core, why divide ?
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:19:49
21 has vision about world but its too early I think :)
@_date: 2016-10-01 09:33:35
those phone dont have 4g
@_date: 2016-10-14 22:17:18
maybe 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, total volume in BTC and USD ?
@_date: 2016-10-11 17:10:01
end it went down to 0,57 :)
@_date: 2016-10-23 18:35:53
1. I have public key but where can I find private key in electrum ?
2. If hacker got access to my computer could he extract my privatekey ?
3. If I have this 12 words stored on paper can I be somehow hacked ?
Im using default settings.
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:45:59
I like this one. Simple but solving a problem
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:21:41
how is it a problem ? My old laptop has 4 gb of memory and you used only 0,3 gb
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:07:24
thanks very helpful ! 
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:29:14
There is no promise for bigger blogs after SW 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:29:50
Because world is ready even for 4mb blocks. Remember 4mb blocks != every block 4MB
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:35:17

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:13:17
Why would miners want to increase block size as with lower size they got paid more ?
They will think about it when backlog will be 1M+ transactions and fee/size 1000+, then to encourage people to send more transactions and still have fullblocks they will be happy to double blocksize to 2MB with fee/size 600-700 :)
Miners are greedy what is normal and you ask them to be generous and to decrease their revenue.
We need UASF or we are doomed
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:49:25
so he have to lock at least the same amount and he buys ? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:01:44
Margin trading, liquidity providing and 0,1% maker and 0,2% taker would take away all bfx clients.
You could benefit additionaly and set hard cap for usd borrow rates at ~0.1%/day and back it up with your money..
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:35:22
why would they lend for 5% per year their BTC ? If thats lower than 20-30% its not worth it (exchanges got hacked)
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:15:18
good, thanks
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:35:15
We cant get 95%. Even 60-70% will be problem
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:37:51
There is too many of those "2 sec blocks" how about:
solve block1, do not propagate it, check for new blocks by competision and work for next one - block2, when competision probably found block propagate block1 and you have head start over block2 , If you find block2 propagate block1 and block2.
We should check if there arent too many those 3 sec blocks statisticaly they shouldnt happen that often
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:08:17
thanks ! +1 desktop wallet user , -1 exchange BTC wallet user
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:45:46
Can I do it somehow with electrum wallet instaled ?
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:37:52
Coinbase/Gdax arent processing payments in EUR. Look out do not deposit there and withdrawal BTC when you can !!
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:44:55
ATM and +5 years we dont need 10000 tx/s, so one step at a time
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:27:45
If core do not support this something is fishy.
They get SW as wanted and there is 12 months to test and prepare for 2MB HF. They can tell they want 90% consensus for that to happen - that means everyone wants it and devs are people who deliver what people want not what they want as bitcoin is for users not devs or miners with hashrate majority. 
I support this SW2MB strongly.
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:49:02
So it will be like USDT - will work untill id doesnt ?
It will be 1 of 2 multisig ? They couldnt still from us and we cant have both RSK and BTC ?
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:33:20
Can't segwit be softfork ? If yes why not do it now even without 95% ?
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:08:53
if they had 50% hashrate and avarage fee size went 4x they did good job and earned a lot more than without spam, I see it as a problem
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:39:23
go to kraken usdt/usd market. Difference should be about that amount +-1% max
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:28:02
will destroy userbase(people who buys with btc) and new users experience. btc will be fine but marketcap will be as low as it is now
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:00:48
Is 1st link save ? Can someone confirm ?
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:12:13
my is 0,00011 BTC . I always use it and have no problems
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:32:01
So there is no problem to increase block size
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:00:18
Any safe way to sell those BCC ? 0,2 BTc is great price if you ask me :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:21:13
BS, 95%+ inactive or more otherwise those 100k would buy 10-50M $ of BTC per day 
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:51:01
maybe there is mining cartel ? I mean with 60-70% mining power they should do that to maximize profits
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:44:05
thats why LN dude !
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:26:19
why wont you call FBI ? Do that operate in US too ?
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:47:56
same for electrum
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:18:33
0,0027 BTC for pizza 0,006 fee :/
