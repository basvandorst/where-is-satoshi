Thanks! Good suggestions, I will add them to a future release!
For now, I use MultiBit's internal AES256 wallet encryption.

Good question! You can verify sha1sums, or build it yourself - the entire project uses open source software only. The scripts to build the USB stick are included and are very handy!

From an earlier reply:
I am using this technique for long-term, offline storage. I don't anticipate withdrawing these funds for many years.
By that time, I expect their to be better options, such as Trezor, and more secure operating systems.
Until then, I have 2 options. I can access my encrypted wallet from any system through the /cdrom/ directory on the USB stick, or I can boot into the live OS and send from MultiBit without ever using a browser. There's some (healthy) skepticism in this thread, but I would choose the latter because I trust the distro.
I also have the choice of sending any remaining funds to a fresh offline wallet that has also been created completely offline.

How can you be sure your computer doesn't have malware that automatically saves any generated wallet/keys for later upload, when you connect back to the internet?
With Bitcoin's rise in popularity (and price), and the prevalence of eastern European crimeware, I'm not prepared to take that risk.

It is meant to stay offline. Don't connect to WiFi!
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:18:29
Great suggestion! I'll throw the scripts and HOWTO up separately on the download page, give me a sec.
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:06:27
You don't have to trust me - you can use the scripts provided to create your own distro. It's easy to keep it offline - unplug from Ethernet and don't connect to a WiFi network!

Back online now... I really need to change providers. :( Next up on my todo list.

I appreciate your skepticism, and will try to reply to your concerns.
I spent a lot of time trying to use unetbootin, and couldn't get it to work: the USB stick would never boot! When I started creating my first USB stick, I thought it was going to be as simple as you suggest, but I was surprised to find it was as difficult as it was.
Instead, I eliminated unetbootin as a dependency and used dd and other native tools to write the ISO, MBR and mark the partition as active. If you prefer unetbootin, by all means use it. There are many ways to solve every problem. (I think you will still need to modify syslinux.cfg to set working boot parameters and mark the partition as active.)
The MBR I used comes from syslinux.org 6.02: syslinux-6.02/bios/mbr/mbr.bin and the sha1sum is 448992a29ae60e9985189649afcda40a58b7f712. You are welcome to verify.
There is nothing preventing this from going online. The recommendation is to stay offline by not connecting to WiFi and unplugging any ethernet. In my opinion, this is secure enough! Optionally, you can choose to go online if you would like to update software, or send money.
I included Nvidia drivers because they fixed major performance issues on the systems I was able to test with. They are not installed by default, and I thought it to be useful. I agree that I shouldn't expect every system to be running Nvidia, but I can't possibly support every graphics card. I will consider removing the drivers in a future version.
The last part of the README doc is a basic guide for anyone wanting to create their own ISO, if you do not want to use any of this project. 
Finally, to clarify the intent of the project... I originally wanted a seamless way to create USB sticks for my friends and family to manage their bitcoins. After seeing so many novice users (in this subreddit) lose their bitcoins due to loss or theft, I thought I would offer the solution to computer-savvy users who may not be experts who can do this from the ground up on their own.
Let me know if you have any more questions.

Check out the BitcoinColdStorageLite zip file - it has all of the scripts and files needed without the ISO!
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:39:32
Good suggestion!

This seems to be due to the hosting provider I am using (LibertyVPS).
From the Malwarebytes website: Users who run peer-to-peer(P2P) programs will see these alerts frequently. Due to the heavy amount of malicious content on these networks we block most by default, until cleaned of all threats.
They seem to be blocking other legitimate Bitcoin projects, like cgminer, as well.
 
I will look into hosting it elsewhere. Does anyone have any recommendations for VPS providers that accept BTC?
Edit: I've since moved hosting providers to OVH, and it should no longer be flagged by Malwarebytes.
Edit: I've also switched domains, check out [coldstoragebitcoin.com](

Yes. Check out the BitcoinColdStorageLite zip!

At some point you have to put trust somewhere. I've chosen to not put mine in a computer that regularly browses the internet.
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:00:18
A quick update...
I've registered a new domain to go along with the new hosting on OVH. Here's the new link: [coldstoragebitcoin.com](
Thanks for the continued feedback and e-mail... I'll be putting together a new ISO with the new version of Multibit shortly!

Using VirtualBox still relies on trusting your Host OS that you use to browse the internet every day.
Ubuntu Live is much more secure; this project makes creating a USB stick much easier. (I don't have a cdrom!)

I have moved providers to OVH, and it should no longer be blocked in Malwarebytes. Please let me know if there are any more issues!

The issue remains: where do you generate it? How do you know that system is secure and safe from malware?
By the way, I also included the Bitcoin Paper Wallet generator within Ubuntu!
