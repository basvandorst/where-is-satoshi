T0, nowdays, we function with FIAT. If we envisage a T1 where we'll have mass adoption of crypto, then it is obvious that a transition period should follow. Hence the need to coexist for some time. And still ... no means to have a easy conversion.

Totally agree. Bitcoin is build on top of blockchain technology. But it IS NOT blockchain. Blockchain has multiple applications beside cryptocurencies. Actually the blockchain technology appeared in the early 90's (allthough not distributed). 
Concerning this statement "The only way to pay for use of the blockchain and the miners to authenticate your transactions is with bitcoin" ... well seems to me you got it backwards :-). Using the blockchain is not a need in itself, doing whatever you want with your money could be one, willing to transact at low fees, having instant transactions etc. Blockchain is just a technological mean. Nobody crave for using blockchain because they want their wallet address to appear in a transaction block inside the blockchain. 
All in all ... my initial question still stands, and i think it is fair to say that without mass adoption, this is not sustainable.

But which is that constant bitcoin demand ? For me this is a myth. There are no supporting arguments for this claim. Please, bring some references, i could find any supporting this ideea, that there is a constant bitcoin demand.

So to the question: which is the demand you simply answer: well, there should be some as the price is increasing, hence QED. Concerning the trading volume, this cannot be considered a proof of demand, as there are constanlty new altcoins appearing and there is huge transfer back and forth from bitcoin to altcoin and vice-versa. This is how some of them are growing 100% in a day, then crash in the next one. So ... trading volume is not an indication neither. Concerning the anticipation for demand, this applies to all kind of commodities, it is like saying, well ... Bitcoin is a good investment (anticipation of demand) because it is, because someday "blockchain becomes a substitute for trusted ...". Well could be that blockchain will become, but bitcoin is not blockchain.

If exchanges are the best thing we'll get for this purpose, there will be no mass adoption for crypto. Gonna be a mean for washing money and paying for illegalities. 
Which should not be something decent people should support ...

This must be a joke. Bitcoin adoption rate is so small that it is not reasonable to propose such thing. What are you gonna buy with Bitcoin? You will save 90% of your monthly income and probably die starving. So far Bitcoin is not an alternative to FIAT and conventional money transfer means.

So most of the miners are located in China. Fair enough. But still ... the numbers are those. Therefore, even with cheap electricity, 1.3 mld yearly is spent for Bitcoin mining. How is this constant bitcoin dump balanced? I guess it is not, there is no counter demand. Which leads to the question: what is driving the price?
