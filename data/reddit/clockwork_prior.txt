Britain: Register a seemingly harmless company for £12, and use false contact info to launder millions. Lie to keep yourself safe.
Bitcoin: By default, publicly record your transactions/addresses to a ledger that anyone can view.
Hmmm.... If I wanted to launder money, which option would I choose? It's just such a close call

You’re right. Sex workers should have the ability to accrue sovereign wealth... it’s just the platform of HBO is so big they could just do better

Great point. I feel safe recommending dollar cost averaging though. $20 here and there consistently... no life-changing wealth to be realized right away, but it’s a starting point. First milestone becomes .01 btc accumulated, second becomes owning a hardware wallet, etc.

Now my question seems rather naive. Thank you for the link!

Are you a part of r/hydrohomies ?
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:20:59
just coincidence combined with dollar cost averaging... tough to convince friends who still view it as "too risky"  :(

The value of bitcoin went up 5% today yet the smaller market cap means horse and buggy riders will still laugh at the automobile

Instead of time-locking, I'd try to find a way (if possible) price-lock. 
External storage device unlocks and texts/emails are sent to beneficiaries in the will if 1 btc = $125,000.00 USD

Works with CashApp withdrawals for me. Totally understand where you're coming from though. Depending on how much your holding, it might pay for itself in the not so distant future

Thank you for the idiom correction! I’ll return the favor and suggest that you keep your periods within your quotation marks. 
So, no need to use glacier if you’re content with hardware wallets x multisig?
