A hash of the transaction data, excluding signature data is created. Different parts of the transaction are included in the hash depending on the hash type of the signature. Then the hash is signed and the signature is included in the input of the transaction. This verifies that the owner of the private key approves the transaction and also that the transaction data has not been modified. 
In public key cryptography data always needs to be "signed" with a private key. Then with a public key anyone can verify that the data was signed by the person with the private key associated with the public key.

If you can't quantify an attack, then you shouldn't worry about it too much.
The people submitting pull requests aren't the real issue. Several major developers have submitted pull requests for block size limit increases and the were not pulled. The people that control it are those with permission to actually pull those into the main branch. They control the direction of Bitcoin. How do you determine who has that permission? The [People]( page on the bitcoin github doesn't show the level of access. Does everyone on there have pull permission? There are 21 people on there and 5 work for Blockstream. Several don't have real names, so I can't confirm whether or not they work for Blockstream.
Amaury Sechet has been the main developer so far, but there are others. I agree so far development is basically centralized because it is new, but Bitcoin Unlimited and other teams are also working on it. I believe there will be many more developers and teams on Bitcoin Cash as it grows. Amaury said his work on BCH was funded by a grant and he said the grant was not related to cryptocurrency.
I also agree that Bitmain is a strong supporter of Bitcoin Cash and helped start it. It is in their best interest for SHA256 backed crypto-currencies to thrive. It doesn't mean they control it.

Do you think BTC can scale with 1 MB blocks? If so then you have been mislead.
It was not short sighted. The block size limit increase has been requested for years by many Bitcoin developers. Including many still on the core team. They also fixed the quadratic signature hash problem and improved the difficulty adjustment algorithm. You should check out the development plans of Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin ABC. They both look promising and will be in Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:19:03
Yeah, I agree. It is more like network advantage.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:36:09
Segwit doesn't really reduce transaction size. Even though I know they said that. It just discounts some of the block space used by the transaction so that more Segwit transactions are allowed in a block before it hits maximum size. It does cost roughly 30% less in fees because of this discount, but there is no real performance increase.

Bitcoin Cash Fund had a vote and most supporters voted to change the color to green to distance themselves from Bitcoin Core. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:05


Easier to attack and likely to get attacked are two different things though. Anyone with less hash rate is easier, but it is very unlikely because of the way Bitcoin is designed.


I agree, but Bitcoin Cash has only been around for 4 months. I believe this will increase. I am coming out with another implementation soon. Compare this to BTC though. How many people use Core vs anything else, and how many commits are done by non Blockstream employees.


I have heard Roger say that off chain solutions are good as long as they are optional. I agree with him on this. I think when many of the people say it is against "Satoshi's vision" they mean that on chain transactions still need to be functional to everyday users. If it is only cost effective to use off chain solutions for paying people, then that isn't even really block chain anymore, so I can see how that would not be Satoshi's vision.


I don't know what CSW did to prove he was Satoshi to Gavin. I believe it is possible he proved it to him, but chose not to thoroughly prove it to the world for some reason. So I am not going to say Gavin is wrong unless someone proves him wrong. I don't need to believe CSW is Satoshi. It doesn't really matter who it is to me. I like what Satoshi did, but this is a leaderless movement.


[Here]( is a list of 966 Bitcoin ABC 16.1 nodes with locations. Based on [this] ( that is almost 65% of the 1500 Bitcoin Cash nodes. I don't see a way on that site to run statistics on that list. It does show a lot of nodes from Hangzhou, China, but I don't think it is 50%, and remember that is only 70% of nodes. I will have to pull the peer IPs from my node and make a report from it.

Bitcoin Cash has 10% or more of the hash power and it is growing. A 51% attack would be very expensive and prove that BTC miners are willing to collude. This would greatly devalue BTC. 
Bitcoin Cash has several independent development teams including Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and more. 
I haven't heard anyone say they would add Segwit. The general consensus is to implement a simpler transaction ID malleability fix to enable LN. Second layer solutions are good if they are not required for functionality. 
The public faces of Bitcoin Cash also include Gavin Andresen, the developer that Satoshi gave control of development to when he left. The CEO of Bitcoin thing was a joke. If you read it you would understand.
The last one is just wrong. It was thoroughly discredited. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:32:44
It is easier to implement the changes Bitcoin Cash made than to implement Segwit. So it is easier to move to BCH than stay on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:46:28
I think the main reason they say they are the real Bitcoin is because they are pushing for on chain transactions, where they enjoy the benefits of on chain transactions like censorship resistance. BTC is planning to move 99.9999% of transactions off chain. If most transactions are not on a block chain, can you really call it block chain technology? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:22:37
Bitcoin Cash has low fees because the block size limit is set based on what the network can handle, which is well above 1 MB. They have the security / immutability in their block chain because even at 10%of BTC hash power it is more than most other alt coins.
Bitcoin Cash supporters have been asking for BTC to increase the block size limit for 3 years, so they are pretty sure it is not happening anytime soon. 
Bitcoin Cash supporters agree that raising block size alone will not scale completely, but it is required to scale. 1 MB is not even enough to support opening and closing LN channels. As second layers like LN are available they will be integrated into Bitcoin Cash. Can you imagine opening a LN channel for a penny?
If the primary chain can't support everyone opening and closing LN channels regularly and reliably then LN will not provide scaling.

I am pretty sure insider trading only applies to publicly owned company stock, options, or bonds. Since owning Bitcoin is not ownership in Coinbase it doesn't apply.
It is shady to trade on information like that and I am sure Coinbase would take action if they can prove it, but it is not illegal.

What is the better tech that you have? You don't have the quadratic signature hash problem fixed in regular transactions. You don't have a more agile DAA. You don't have reliable confirms or fees. You aren't working towards on chain processing efficiency.

@_date: 2018-08-02 02:43:15
Wow, big post. Hard to respond to.
TX malleability currently only relevant for  LN transactions.
Quadratic sig hash is solved in nearly identical method. Only real difference is that on BTC it only applies to Segwit transactions. Learn your basics. This is completely solved on BCH and not partially solved, like only in a voluntary transaction format. BCH has true linear sig hash operations on every single transaction. 
Economic incentives to reduce UTXO set are not aligned with cost of managing UTXO set. Who decided that closing is 4x cheaper than opening.
Bug fixes and other minor issues are being handled on BCH just fine.
BCH DAA handles swings in hash rate with no downside. The most proof of work chain is always the most valid.


Market conditions change. If you are not aware, or they change after you send your transaction and before the next block, then your transaction might not confirm for a while. That is a big problem. BCH has appropriate block size limits and can confirm nearly all reasonable transactions in the next block nearly every block. 
BTC worked for years while ignoring on chain scaling. Bitcoin Unlimited identified several issues with single threaded operating that slowed acceptance into mem pool which was a bottleneck to on chain scaling. Has BTC upgraded this yet? BCH has!
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:49:47
It was just a lot. Keeping things more concise often helps.


BCH also added a fork ID to the sig hash, which allows for easy replay protection on future forks. So it is not identical. Do you know how open source works? If the problem is already solved, they why reinvent the wheel? My point with this was to say that BCH requires this improved algorithm on all transactions. In BTC it is optional, which is not good for a vulnerability fix.


Please give examples. There are no known attacks on BCH, that are fixed on BTC, to my knowledge. BCH does a hard fork update every 6 months with major and minor updates to the software. 


Forks are not bad, despite what you may have been told. They allow for competition, experimentation, and increased decentralization. All of which strengthen the system. If forks are not allowed, then the system is clearly centralized and controlled by whoever is not allowing them. If you can't handle, or don't want competition, then you likely have an inferior product.


When most BCH supportors say "original vision", they mean a decentralized peer to peer electronic cash. Anything that furthers that goal is appropriate. Claiming a more agile DAA or forks are somehow against this vision is baseless. Reducing usage and adoption for some vague fear of centralization is not in line with that vision. It actually centralizes the system more. Increased adoption will decentralize the system far better than small blocks. Most people that have a vested interest in running a full node can afford hardware to process very large blocks very easily. Others can trustlessly use the system through SPV.

I am running a Bitcoin Cash node on my 6 year old Linux machine. It has been seeing blocks over 1 MB regularly and has processed many blocks that almost 4 MB. It processes even large blocks in seconds. The cost of running it is very minimal.
Raising the block size is one of many scaling features that will be implemented on Bitcoin Cash.

Miner's are taking a big risk on cryptocurrency. Much more risk than the stock market. They wouldn't take that risk for a 1% profit margin. It has to be much higher or they would be much smarter in a less risky investment. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 04:32:46
Fees on average are still only 1% of the block reward. According to fork.lol. A miner could choose to leave a lot of that on the table. Especially if they are just selling for another coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:00:27
I think most people see what they want to see. He is explaining the positives and negatives of both sides of the scaling debate.
Raw block size increases alone are not likely to sustain future adoption. If Bitcoin takes off like it should. Blocks larger than 1 MB are completely supportable by the average PC running a full node.
Obviously a block size of 1 GB anytime soon is not feasible. I think it is also clear that 1 MB is not sufficient anymore. Blocks are often full and fees are high. This is not healthy for Bitcoin. It is slowing adoption. Until SegWit is fully adopted and side chains are fully functional and adopted a 1 MB block size is not going to be functional. Ideally by that time even with those improvements 1 MB will still not be enough. 100 million people opening and closing a channel once a month will not fit in 1 MB.
As any good software developer knows optimization is key in software as in life. You can't go all in for one benefit or another. You have to balance memory improvements against processor improvements. You could make software use very little memory at great cost to processor usage, or use very little processor while using way more memory. The key is to find a happy medium where memory usage is reasonable and processor usage is as well.
The optimization in this situation is the easy costly fix, block size increase, versus the more difficult, more efficient, longer term fixes like SegWit and side chains. There has to be a balance between the two. No block size increase is equal to no balance and poor optimization.

Sorry, I misspoke. I found a source saying some other startup actually came up with Lightning Network. The patent I had heard about was for side chains. You can read about it [here](
I also found [this]( stating their intent for patents is for defense.
Please read the rest of my comment, as the patent isn't really my point.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:04:20
~~Lightning Network~~ *Some side chain technology* is patented by Blockstream, and they have plans to sell software and charge fees for running Lightning Network nodes. This doesn't mean they will enforce these patents. Often patents are just to defend against patent lawsuits. It also doesn't mean they won't release their software open source to allow people to run it for free if they can administer it themselves.
The main thing I am worried about is that LN is not proven to work in a decentralized and censorship resistant manor yet. It seems likely that it will become hub based where users will create a channel with their local hub in order to do transactions with each other. If not, then that is great and I will definitely use it.
Meanwhile, in the short term, moderate increases to block size is simple, effective, and is proven to maintain the decentralized and censorship resistant properties. All effective nodes now can easily handle 8 MB or larger blocks.
I don't understand why there isn't more of a balance between the two methods of scaling. I get that it isn't really used as a currency now, but wouldn't it be nice if you could.

[Here]( is the basic explanation of it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:02:52
To be a successful fork, you have to have hash power and user support. There is no way to prevent a fork in an open source project. The only protection a chain has is to be superior and, as a result, have more hash power and users.
A miner can always mine old blocks, that still match a specific chains consensus rules. But without majority hash power their branch on the chain will never have more hash power than the main chain, so it will never be considered the valid chain and the block rewards the miners would get are not valid. So it would never be profitable or even cause any problems. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:46:04
In my opinion they don't misrepresent it. They clearly say BTC and BCH. Or Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash. There is plenty of discussion on both, so no one could be in there long before understanding there are two and the basic differences. If people don't know the difference they can easily find out and make their own decisions. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:32:18
It is 8 MB weighted block size. With normal transactions the blocks are likely to be around 3.5 MB actual size.
Also, as other people are saying, that is only with near 100% Segwit transactions. I think it is closer to 10% Segwit transactions right now. So they will still be pretty close to 2 MB actual size. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:39
Expensive paperweights is a little strong. They will still be able to mine 2X and Cash just fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:40:30
If you move your coins to another address you own after the fork and that chain fails, then the coins will still be in the previous address on the other chain.
The only way you lose coins is if someone else pays you on only one chain and you give them something for the payment, then that fork fails. Their payment would no longer be valid, because it isn't on the longest proof of work chain.

I understand that it is open source. People sell supported or fee based versions of open sourced software all the time.
Sorry, I should have provided sources in the original post. I have seen documents from Blockstream explaining their revenue plans, but can't find them right now. They are a business and have to make money somehow. I am not saying it is bad. I am just saying that is how it works.


Maybe I am using the terminology wrong. Lightning Network is a type of "side chain", right? If not, can someone please explain the difference to me?

Okay, thanks for correcting me. Sounds like I have some of the details wrong. Are you saying Blockstream is working on Lightning Network for free, with no plans for profit? I would assume at the very least they are planning on selling services around it. Can we at least agree on that? :-)
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:53:02
It is miners, many major Bitcoin businesses, and many users against Blockstream. Please do your research. Miners and Bitcoin businesses don't gain with a block size increase unless the entire community does. Fees will go down. Blockstream profits if more people use their off chain services, which aren't even ready yet. I just want Bitcoin to be as strong and efficient as possible.

I wouldn't say clogged. The blocks are slow, but they are still clearing out the mempool.
Also, the new difficulty adjustment algorithm is active in 4 hours, so hopefully that helps both chains have more steady block times.

The "longer chain" is the one with the most proof of work, not the most blocks. So it is impossible for a minority hash power to make a longer chain.

I thought old school Bitcoin software generated like 100 key pairs at a time. For change and receiving addresses. So as long as you generated a new set and backed up before running out you were good. It seems like a bad idea to use keys that are not backed up.

So it is all just a big coincidence that there was a big banking crisis at the same time that a bunch of cypher punks came out with a currency that didn't require banks? The cypher punks had no political ideas in mind when they developed this? They just felt like having a new digital currency?

I don't think so. I assume you are talking about before HD keys. If you didn't back up your wallet each time you generated new key pairs then you could lose the value associated with the new key pairs that you lost, but not anywhere near everything in most cases. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:19:56
I agree for the most part. The way I understand this, is that it is more of a protocol issue.
With Bitcoin you always have the ability to backup your keys before using them. There are definitely better ways now than there was.
With Lightning Network however, I don't believe it is possible to perform the backup until after the new state has been negotiated. So if anything fails between the state change and finishing the backup, bad things happen. I am not saying it can't be solved. It is just a little more complex of an issue.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:44:04
Not necessarily disagreeing, but last time I checked fees were closer to 15%. Roughly 15 bitcoins total income per block, 2.5 of which are fees.
If more people were using the network day to day for smaller transactions, wouldn't they be paying for the network? Essentially decreasing the dilution and possibly reversing it.

Sounds like we are using different terminology. I am just saying that proof of work has nothing to do with the amount of transactions. Miners can mine blocks with no transactions (only the coinbase) if they want, and the accumulated proof of work will still increase.
If there is a definition of "chain weight" then please point me at it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:40:36
Yeah. You are right. I know how the block reward works. I guess I inadvertently combined dilution and fee income. Eventually the balance of the two will be reversed. Hopefully not for a long time as 12.5 Bitcoins in fees per block would be crazy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:09:23
I am glad you responded. I would love to be proven wrong by someone who actually knows what is going on. I have mostly been focusing on non-SegWit code, but thought I had the basics down. Sorry for all the questions. I hope you have time to answer them.


Okay, if you look at it that way. I am just saying that the "segregating the witness" part doesn't do that. Another change made as part of that does.


I understand that blocks not being full reduces fees because there is more "supply". Are you saying that fees aren't calculated using the same size weighting as SegWit block sizes?


Really, I do need to do more research on this. Do you have a good source, or do I just need to dig through the code? There is an option to send/store blocks without the witness data though, right? Do they just strip it out as they send/store it?


Yeah, but referencing my question above. Aren't the fees calculated on the weighted size of the transaction? This means if pre-SegWit transactions are side by side with SegWit transactions then the SegWit transaction fees are being discounted compared to the pre-SegWit.


How do miners that accept SegWit transactions have any advantage over those that don't if they can both fill blocks? SegWit transactions don't pay more than the standard fee rate compared to their usage of the block capacity, do they?
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:00:50
When the chain forks the history of the 2 chains will be exactly the same before the fork. So you will have exactly the same amount as before the fork on both chains. So yes 10btc = 10b2x at the fork. Transactions after the fork will only effect the chain they are accepted on.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:51:32
FYI, looks like you can buy Bitcoin 1X futures on Bitfinex as well. Currently priced at 75% current Bitcoin value.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:36:34
Wow, that was fast.


I think to be more accurate it is whatever fee the miners are accepting. Since they have to put it in a block. The transaction being out in the mempool isn't enough on it's own.


That is not what I was saying. I am asking how wallets calculate fees for SegWit vs non-SegWit transactions. I would assume they base it on block capacity usage. So SegWit fees would be a lower per actual KiB rate.


If the nodes aren't upgraded to support SegWit what is the point of them even running on that network? Since they can't actually validate blocks.
Also, so SegWit is just about transaction ID malleability. I was under the impression it was about reducing the end result size of the data. Like so you don't have to store all the signature data forever. If not, then I don't understand why there would be a discounted size weighting for it, other than just to promote it.




This still goes back to my fee calculation question. If wallets are calculating fees based on weighted block capacity usage rather than actual transaction size, then there would be no advantage for miners since 1 MB of non SegWit would be worth the same as 1 weighted MB of SegWit.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:36:06
You could do an initial block download without downloading witness data, relying solely on proof of work for verification.
Pre Segwit you have to download the entire transaction to calculate its transaction ID to verify it is in the block it came with. Even if you aren't checking the signatures themselves. 
*edit for phone autocorrect*
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:02:18


I am still not getting this. So if fees are per unit weight from the wallets and SegWit transactions have lower unit weight, then it seems like non SegWit are just as profitable for miners as SegWit. So as long as miners could still fill blocks while excluding SegWit, they would have blocks with less transactions, but higher per transaction fees, and not be losing any money.
Or are you referring more to the Sig Ops limits that are different for SegWit transactions because BIP 143 makes signature hashes more efficient?


Pre SegWit pruning is for the whole block though, right? I thought SegWit allowed pruning of the witness data while still having a block that proof of work can still be verified on.


Can you point me at something that explains the UTXO scaling fixes? I don't see it in those BIPs 141, 143, or 147.
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:11:54
Replay protection usually requires a wallet update or for a user to know enough about what is going on to "mark" all their UTXOs as only valid on one chain. So whoever implements it is going have less wallets supporting their chain, which is a huge disadvantage.

@_date: 2017-10-29 00:05:55
No. Sorry to be blunt, but you have no idea what you are talking about.




Since the proof of work is done on the block header (it is a hash of the header) and doesn't care how many transactions are in the block, the transaction count doesn't factor in.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:46:58
Oh, I see because the discount is for input data and not output data.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:49:57
That is hard to believe because it doesn't seem like it favors long term profit. If they are basically scamming Bitcoin users and signaling for S2X when they have no intention of working on that chain, then that will just hurt Bitcoin in the long run and reduce their future profits. Sure they can jump back and forth between the two chains for a while and maybe make some short term gains, but not much. Fracturing and alienating Bitcoin users is not good for miners profits.

Can you point me at where it shows Bitcoin Cash miner support before the fork? I haven't seen those numbers.
I think Bitfinex is an exchange strongly skewed toward Bitcoin 1X. I would like to see some numbers from other exchanges.
It seems like the miners signaling support for S2X will immediately start mining that upon the fork. I don't understand why they would signal one way and then immediately do the opposite. Can you help me understand this? Is there some benefit to this?

I read that article and it just explains why the SegWit block weight discount won't make the UTXO set worse. I thought you were saying there was something in the SegWit updates that helped UTXO set.
I was hoping for something like low fees for transactions that consolidate large amounts of UTXOs. Or some motivation for people to consolidate. Currently with high fees there is a strong motivation not to consolidate smaller UTXOs. So if people do small enough transactions then it won't be worth it to spend those and they will be stuck in the UTXO set for a long time.

Sadly that is how most people think.

Okay, that makes sense. 


I know proof of work on the header can be verified without transactions, but you need the full transaction (pre SegWit) to verify which transactions are associated with that header's proof of work via the merkle tree root hash. But since SegWit transaction IDs don't require the witness data, you could verify the merkle tree root hash without them. I will go over that section of the whitepaper again.
Thanks. I will check out that document.

It is about block size. The blocks are full. The volume of transactions are limited by the block size.
If we want more people using Bitcoin then we need bigger blocks. If we want more people using other services like payment channels then we should leave the block size where it is.
The main disagreement is "do we want more people using Bitcoin, or do we want more people using other services like payment channels?".

Well, that seems like semantics. As soon as the "signaling" reached the specified level the update was activated. If the miners didn't want S2X then they wouldn't "signal" it. Even if they implemented it to make sure they were ready. Because "signalling" it is what causes it to happen.

What makes you assume they intend to dump 2x? It has over [90% miner support](

Satoshi mined the first block and put this message in the coinbase transaction input. I think it had a little to do with it.

I am not sure what you are referring to as "chain weight". If you mean "chain with most accumulated proof of work" then that is 100% up to miners. They do the proof of work and choose which chain they do it on. More transactions has nothing to do with longest chain or most proof of work. 
The only thing that can save 1x is if despite having less hash power and higher user fees the users still choose to pay more for it. I don't think there is a reliable way to determine what user support will be like.

I think you have to respect all "employees" as your analogy goes. Otherwise you have to deal with high turnover, and a lower quality employee. Miners are actually closer to independent contractors.
There are several other posts explaining why a 600% value increase isn't a 600% raise, so I will leave that part alone.
I think SegWit disrepects the miners. The developers chose to change the format of the transactions (to move the "witness" out of the main part), then they also chose to arbitrarily reduce fee rate and block "size" impact of that part (witness) of the transactions. The change in format in no way makes the transactions cheaper for miners to validate or broadcast, which are two of their three main roles. The other being the hashing of the header after building a block. They still have to validate all the transactions in nearly exactly the same way. They also still have to transmit the main block as well as the witness data for nodes to accept them and add them to the chain.
So according to your analogy the developers decided that miners would do their work for discounted pay. Independent contractors are free to work for who they want and if they aren't happy at their current contract then they will find a different one.
The miners didn't want SegWit, which is why they originally didn't signal support for it. But then NYA happened and they struck a deal. If they got 2 MB blocks then they would support SegWit. I think if the 2 MB block fork fails then miners will stop giving the free discount for SegWit transactions because they have no cause to. They just have to adjust their software to calculate fee rates based on the total transaction like it always has been. They won't lose anything because they can still build valid blocks with non SegWit transactions if the wallets don't adjust accordingly.
