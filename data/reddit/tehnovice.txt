What about a group that is helping with research for Alzheimer's? My grandma passed away with that...and it's so fucking heartbreaking to see people suffer like that.

I've got about, .03 of Bitcoin right now, and wishing I had some more. If your wallet gets heavy I'll take one off you. Best of luck to you and may the charts rain green in the years to come.

Would there be any concern of buying Bitcoin at the moment, with all this noise I hear about August 1st?
I'd like to pump a $20 bill here and there every little chance I can.
Not sure if that is the best way to do so, or if I should just save it and then buy it in one full swoop.
