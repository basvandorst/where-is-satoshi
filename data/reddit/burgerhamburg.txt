The long term Bitcoin chart price chart looks pretty darn good.

It'll probably get shut down though... Shapeshift isn't doing AML/KYC.
@_date: 2016-03-11 21:04:15
seems to have more altcoiners in it than bitcoiners these days. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:11:28
I'm sorry, but this is laughable... the cost is extremely high because every node has to store every transaction forever, and because mining operations are extremely expensive. Decentralized money isn't cheap at all. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:59:45
As proven when the Ethereum Foundation directly manipulated the blockchain to reverse the outcome of the DAO contract hack. That's pretty centralized and it can happen again.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:01:41
Pretty interesting that a non-sequitur is the top comment. Hmmm, how does that happen? 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:57:18
90% is probably more achievable while still representing consensus. Otherwise I fully agree with you.

 &gt; The variable fees will definitely still confuse new adopters of btc
I bet most people won't even notice. I mean, I certainly wouldn't care if the fee automatically fluctuated between 2 and 20 cents. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:43:30
Well look at the over-the-top downvoting going on. Parent's comment doesn't deserve -28 ffs. The sorting is justified.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:57:17
It's an entirely different kind flying
@_date: 2016-03-04 04:16:46
Focusing in one data structure in Bitcoin, and identifying that as what makes it successful, is pretty hilarious. The grammar oddness just makes it funnier.
Blockchain will revolutionize finance!
Array will revolutionize finance!
Merkle Tree will revolutionize finance!
Bloom Filter will revolutionize finance!
Etc etc

Must be a pro-BU site.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:55:53
Interesting. So Satoshi was AGAINST hard forks created by software with deliberately incompatible consensus rules.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:02:49
 &gt; tacit approval of the horrendous censorship occurring in this subreddit/bitcointalk/bitcoin.org
That's really crazy... come on. Can you point to any evidence of this tacit approval? 
I think that you'll find near unanimous agreement among everyone that the censorship here is wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:56:18
I agree with that. Bitcoin is what the community decides it to be. 
Currently BU doesn't seem to have a chance of winning the heart of the community, fortunately.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:44:13


Well he sure did piss all over that, didn't he?
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:56
I think RogerVer already rage quit into altcoins. Now he's trying to destroy Bitcoin to justify that.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:57:18
What the cheap-and-fast payments proponents don't seem to understand is that Lightning is designed specifically to address option 2. So we can have the best of both worlds, as long as we scale in a layered approach.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:00:07
There is at least a supermajority of developers who are happy with the core scaling plan.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:02:39
It's about changing the PoW work function, not removing PoW for something else. The work function can change without changing the nature of Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:04:41
If the fee is $100, then Bitcoin would be a massively successful form of digital gold. That would be awesome.
But there will still be clueless people saying "nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:46:36


This is so wrong it drives me crazy. Miners can't dictate protocol changes because the core client app would just reject any invalid blocks created by the miners.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:47:36
Classic bitcoin meme... love it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:49:03
Miners are the 0.001%. Jihan Wu and maybe 4 other guys in China would control the blocksize if everyone was running BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:03:10
That functionality existed when blocks were empty... it was a temporary situation. And the block subsidy was higher back then. We have to worry about when the block subsidy runs down to a small amount.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:39:19
Yes. You can tell what a community of hundreds of thousands of people is all about by a shitpost on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:18:56
Just as you do.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:01:27
By their contributions.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:02:29
That's what layer two is for.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:53:28
On the other hand, node counts cannot be completely discarded, because obviously not all nodes are sybils. The current number of Core nodes fits within the trend over the last couple of years so it is likely that the real:sybil ratio hasn't changed much.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:13:43
Terrible analogy, because SegWit isn't fundamentally broken in the way that cooling the atmosphere with refrigerators is (the net effect of a refrigerator is obviously more heat).
How about this:
Core: Here's a tank of gas to help us get to our next stop on the scaling road.
BU: A tank of gas won't allow us to drive all the way to the destination, so we'll stay where we are.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:12:01
...because blocks were empty and the subsidy was high. That was a bootstrapping incentive. Those days are over.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:06:08
A cheaper coin that has low usage or that sacrifices decentralization for high capacity or that is in its early high subsidy phase. You can't compare that to where Bitcoin is right now.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:43:37

@_date: 2016-01-18 20:43:55
Your coins will be on the Core and Classic chains after a fork. There will be two Bitcoins at that point: Bitcoin Core, and Bitcoin "Classic". You will have to choose which one to use for receiving and spending your coins. 
One of the two Bitcoins will eventually fall in value faster than the other one, causing it to rapidly be abandoned, relegating it to altcoin status. So choose wisely! If you're not planning on spending or receiving during the period of uncertainty, then you'll have less to worry about. But even the value of the "winning" Bitcoin will have taken a major beating due to the uncertainty. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:37:08
Well, they *would* have those problems were they to get big enough. This is a problem that eventually happens to all successful open projects.
@_date: 2017-03-26 20:07:52
That's what we have today. What's the problem?
If cash included a self-transport mechanism so that it flew itself to any recipient on the planet while avoiding regulators, do you think it wouldn't include a transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:46:47
Wow how obvious is that.

You have to admit, the discussion in this subreddit improved drastically after got heavy handed with the moderation. This place sucked when the mob had control of the front page.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:30:49
Why? Because you didn't like one of Szabo's tweets? Because he happens to not agree with your point of view? That's pretty silly, given his stature in financial cryptography. Honestly, some of the comments here are mind boggling in their ignorance.
@_date: 2015-08-20 18:52:35
That's an interesting summary of the issue. I'm definitely in that first camp. The only thing, to me, that really distinguishes bitcoin over other monetary systems is censorship resistance, so I think it's important to favor decentralization over any other consideration.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:52:59
The crowd here will not have it. Obviously Nick Szabo is an evil agent of Blockstream /s
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:50:23
That's why Reddit is fundamentally broken as a forum to hash out the issues for something as complicated as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:49:09
It doesn't work so well when legitimate comments get downvoted into oblivion, which has been happening a lot recently. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:04:28
From a miner's perspective, a halving is effectively the same as the difficulty doubling, which it has done many times since the beginning. So in that sense, we've had many quiet and uneventful halvings without even realizing it.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:59:17
No, the miner is out of luck, because he wasted electricity on a block that the rest of the network is rejecting. Why are you having a hard time understanding this? 
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:17:55
Why? They're the good guys. Unless you're crazy, or from (but I repeat myself).
