Its not easy to liquidate 14k BTC without slippage. Also you have massive exposure whilst holding your position. There is certainly a small group of whales that have the ability to corner the market but I imagine it is a much larger and sophisticated play over months not weeks

There is a miner and node in space which gives me comfort. Even a nuclear apocalypse can't stop bitcoin.
