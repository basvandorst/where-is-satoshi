What's the point of a car dealer website with no prices? Do they seriously expect me to phone\contact them to find out the prices of the cars I'm interested in? Not going to happen. I have a certain budget, and I want to create a shortlist of cars that falls in that budget BEFORE I contact them for a test ride.

I just decimated my sandwich. Typically most people would think I destroyed it, but in reality it just means I ate 10% of my sandwich.

What is the evidence that women earn less than men for the same job and hours worked in the USA or the UK?

It angers me to think that offensive idiots like you, are a part of the Bitcoin community.

I'll try it as soon as it's available for Firefox. I don't trust Chrome with my bitcoins.

Geez, how many more government researchers that use supercomputers to mine for bitcoin will we see this week? It's becoming pandemic! /s

Good. I admire his contributions to Bitcoin, but I don't appreciate it that he uses his fame as a platform to promote the feminist agenda. I had to remove him from my twitter feed to escape his white knighting.

I would love the ability to run Mycelium offline on an old Android phone in Airplane mode, with the ability to sign transactions on a USB key via USB OTG or via QR codes. This will eliminate the need for an offline computer/Raspberry Pi to sign transactions, and will be portable and could be used anywhere.

Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.

Anytime something doesn't make sense on reddit, the answer is almost always kids.

To be frank - if you need to wait for payday to buy anything with a value less than your salary you probably can't afford it.

I had no idea that the [ALOT]( can help recover Bitcoin wallets by speeding up password mutations. Truly a wondrous creature.

The problem with Circle is that they bootstrapped themselves into a viable business largely with the support of the Bitcoin community by offering an amazingly simple way to buy &amp; use Bitcoin, only to abandon the same community post haste when they felt they no longer them.

"You're" is the contraction for "You are", and so your sentence reads as "I just read you are post...".

Great if you live in London.

Not in the east (Chelmsford, Colchester, Ipswich, Norwich etc). I did check the link &amp; Google, which is why I posted my message. The closest BTC atm to me is a 80 minute drive in total by car to London. It will take nearly 4 hours in total using public transport.

We were all so optimistic before the Great Scaling War started.

I seem to recall that the US government have had more than a few Bitcoin auctions to sell funds they seized. Seems like they can take it at will.

Wrong sub.

Bitcoin isn't mentioned in that article at all. This type of article is just a circle jerk pat on the back to make everyone feel good about being into Bitcoin.

Dutch won't be of much use on a German website though :p

I really admire the amount of effort &amp; dedication you put into hating something you don't like. Have you ever considered offering a nemesis service on reddit? Ironically Bitcoin would be ideal for receiving payments from your international clients.

FWIW: "alot" is not a word in the English language.
