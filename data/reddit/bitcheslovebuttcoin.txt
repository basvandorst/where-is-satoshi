I completely agree that the decision was made incorrectly but the part I havent wrapped my head around is how would asking for community input go exactly? 
I already see multiple bitcoin factions growing throughout twitter and reddit with very different ideologies. Just look at rbtc vs rbitcoin.

This is the truth right here.
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:38:23
ah, duh it actually says 'Bitfinex cold storage' right there. I was thinking that was 'some customer' there and not the exchange itself.

I can recall the 2013 Thanksgiving November season and coins shot up to 1k from 350 range, it was insane. This current run up to the holidays seriously feels the same to me.
There was a huge crash come the day after Xmas or near there, but there’s so many new people coming it I think it’s going to soften the crash a bit this time. But we’ll see!

If your gut says this is a bad idea. Then it’s a bad idea.

We’re due for a correction but it’s anyone’s guess how much or for how long. There’s so many new users coming onboard. If you believe in the long term viability of bitcoin then it’ll likely go much higher even after the correctional. At least it has every time so far. :p
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:15:28
Yeah I get what you're saying as far as reliably making consistent gains but but there might be an Amazon or Hulu (if that's the analogy we're going with). I think Bitcoin is great as a store of value but it's a wide open playing field for many other amazing blockchains that will store other types of assets or perform functions we haven't even fathomed.

You’re correct they’ve built their own replay protection mechanism which is better than what the segwit2 coins will have (nothing). 
If you don’t trust yourself to split coins using a hardware wallet (which is the recommended way, to handle your own private keys) then the next best option is to trust Coinbase to split them for you. 
Google Coinbase Bitcoin Segway Fork FAQ to read about how they’re handling the fork. They don’t want to loose customers and I’m sure they’ll figure out what’s best.

Sure that's fair, albeit those terms are fuzzy because a correction can be 20% (or more up to 40%) according to investopedia and similar sites.
I never said 90%, but the real point is that it's naive to think 'this is it' and not expect a 'crash' or large correction and somehow this is different. I'm not bashing on bitcoin, it's just how the entire past has been up to this point and until we see a new pattern, that's what we should expect.

Just read their FAQ 
At the time of the fork, the existing chain will be called Bitcoin and the Segwit2x for will be called Bitcoin2x. Ultimately, we will call the fork with the most accumulated difficulty Bitcoin. We will wait for a period of time after the fork, before finalizing the naming

I know right! And the more you buy the more you save!

Some of my relatives who are very successful entrepreneurs would buy gold before bitcoin because they’re not great with computers, don’t trust the internet, do trust gold, have been fished and hacked before and still use the same password on every website (and refuse to use 1Password at my request). Honestly I wouldn’t even trust them setting up a Coinbase account and not getting phished or hacked. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:05:52
Is that why the current run up?!
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:15:08
7% correction is nice and all but I think you need to zoom out on the charts. This feels VERY similar to the holiday season run up of 2013 where we went from low 300s right before thanksgiving to over 1k and crashed much much harder than 7%. Not saying we’re going to relive that but saying we’re not overdue for a larger crash is just silly or you weren’t around for those.  
(I realize this is a new Reddit account, my old had too much pii)
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:21:59
Yeah it’s like whatever fits their fascination wins out.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:17:56
What the actual fuck 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:29:51
The fact that they love specific relics of internet’s past doesn’t mean they don’t grok new technologies, just that they give certain tech a hug so hard they can’t ever let go. They’re quite advanced in tech with all their robots and bullet trains. 
I love that they’ve adopted bitcoin as their own, I just wish transactions fees were lower so it’d function better as a currency there since that’s how they appear to be using it.

Side chains run independently of the main blockchain as to mitigate risk and or enable additional functionality of the primary blockchain. If the primary blockchain doesn’t support side chains then that’s when a software fork would come in to enable sidechain functionality.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:16:33
Well that explains what side you’re on but doesn’t really answer my question. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:32:57
I’ll take their internet
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:37:20
It generates long entropy pseudorandom passwords that are unique to every website and auto logs in to most sites and works on mobile. If a website gets compromised those creds don’t matter since they don’t work on any other site. It’s awesome, been using it for years.
You can also save credit cards, software licenses and any info you want to secure into the locker.

Yes, we’ve all learned this. It’s hard to outperform the hodler life.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:20:50
Apparently performing cabaret at the Robot restaurant in Shinjuku or fighting the giant USA megabot. :p
But in all seriousness Wikipedia talks about how serious Japan is about robotics, more so than any other country. Industrial robots and building amazing cars, etc.
Also, how’s Japan?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:52:34
That's what they (this sub) said, literally every time. But ok, let's call the 7% correction. 'The correction'. I'm long bitcoin but it's pretty normal at this point to have huge crashes and it'd be dumb not to expect that.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:21:42
Alts compliment bitcoin and bring more investments, investors, projects into the space, more money into bitcoin as people trade across currencies and help propel all of the cryptocurrency space forward. 
Embrace the space don’t throw mud.
