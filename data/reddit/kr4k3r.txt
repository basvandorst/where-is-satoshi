Get well friend. Found your short term moon. My best to you and your family! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:54
It appears that you're doing it correctly.  Buy high, sell low. Shits easy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:30:57
You owe me life back
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:19:16
Don't be so hard on yourself friend. We've all done it. You're young; bounce back and learn from this mistake. You'll be aight, bitcorn isn't going anywhere. Just accumulate some more and only trade 10% or less of your holdings going forward.
If you want to practice trading shoot me a pm and I can guide you to a very good testnet. (Not sure if I can link on here)

Check coinbase....will say pending, click address
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:05:40
If they also have a coinbase account, you can email it to their coinbase associated email, And also attach a note to it. Or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:01:42
Heavens no.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:11:53
Ill throw in when that time comes.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:55:25
Wire money to coinbase, transfer to gdax.

@_date: 2017-10-09 03:47:31
I almost gave up on everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:04:17
Scam, this piece of shit is sending "iota" not "Miota". Scammed some poor redditor yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:45:28
Cool story. How about a legitimate source rather than just spreading FUD.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:49:47
Plz just the tip?!
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:18:21

Scam!!! Sending iota not miota. This piece of shit won't stop scamming people. Also, he threatened to hack me lol. Tried to reset my Reddit password. Because I keep calling out his scam.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:08:15
Not sure about your first question. In regards to the second question, I've personally bought from coinbase numerous times. Then send directly offline. It's as convenient as it gets. Fees seem a bit high, but again, convenience 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:21:17
I know the feeling friend. Hopefully we can all pick up some good sales the next couple weeks..
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:28:54
That's awesome. Congrats to you and him. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:11:30
You're my favorite person. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:03:55
Super curious how one just "comes into some bitcoin".. either way, pretty awesome. If you're not familiar I'd do a bit of research before you do anything rash. I myself am a holder (long term). I believe bitcoin has a lot gain in the future...
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:43:07
I'm not sure about the PayPal question. However, don't listen the the negativity. I agree that the fees might wipe you out, but if $3 is what you have to save/invest, do it.  You certainly have to start somewhere. Hopefully, this first $3 dollars gets you started and snowballs into 3 million. I wish you the best OP.  No better time to start ...
Edit: welcome to the community. We're happy to have you.

It's not bad, I prefer juicy juice however.
