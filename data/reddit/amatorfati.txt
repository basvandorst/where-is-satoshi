It's Bitcoin, not BitCoin. Nobody cares what you see or don't see. If you can't understand the potential and how it vastly outweighs the minor temporary drawbacks that scaling has run into, nobody really cares if you choose to miss out on this opportunity. We won't miss you.

Hey mate, welcome back.
It means you need to be holding cryptocurrency, always, in a wallet you and you alone control. Otherwise whoever does own the wallet will get to decide how to deal with forks.
Anytime your BTC (or whatever shitcoin) is in somebody's wallet, you don't have jack. You've got, at best, IOUs for some "bitcoin". With a fork, the wallet holder gets to decide what those IOUs now mean. They may or may not give you shit on any potential other chain.
Besides this, most users don't have to think about it much. Price may fluctuate more than normal but with the volatility of cryptocurrency prices anyway, it may not even be all too noticeable, and predicting which way the effect should be is notoriously and hilariously impossible (most for example expected the price to tank around the time of the last fork).
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:09:44

That's is 10000% not how it works. Bitcoin is not inherently anonymous.
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:47:30
The wallets don't "have" fees, they just have different methods of calculating what fee they think is gear to push your transaction through in a reasonable amount of time. And some wallets do this by giving very precise control to the user while other simplify the issue and give little to no control.
You always, always, always can simply import to another wallet. You are never hostage to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:36:49

@_date: 2017-08-14 02:19:24

@_date: 2017-08-28 10:36:40
Because the percentage per the value you're sending is completely irrelevant. It could be 200% for all we care, that's not how fees are calculated.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:29:47
You are making a lot of really stupid assumptions here. BTC isn't "bought in an exchange"; it's bought and sold like any other asset—however the hell people choose to buy and sell it. There's as many ways of buying and selling as there are buyers and sellers.
Countless people buy and sell anonymously all the time.

@_date: 2017-08-30 04:56:38
You sent BTC to an address specifically generated for use with BCH in one of Shapeshift's wallet.
The deal you agreed to was to send BCH to that wallet. You never paid up your half of the deal. They don't owe you anything.
That BCH address is theoretically a clone of the exact same address as a BTC address. Which is the one you sent it to. It's just that no one is using that BTC address because nobody knows you sent BTC to their address. Shapeshift was expecting BCH not BTC. Shapeshift has the ability to collect that BTC presumably by importing the private key for that address to a BTC wallet, but they have absolutely no obligation to return it to you or accept it as payment of any kind.

That's not how any of this works. You've been here for weeks and constantly giving bad answers to other people's questions, you think you would've learned a few things about bitcoin even accidentally by now.
Confirmations just means the number of confirmations in the chain since your transaction has been included. Obviously the blockchain goes on after your transaction.
Addendum: no number of blocks are "needed", that's still not how anything works.

@_date: 2017-08-16 04:29:50
Your complaint is incredibly confusing because you're not proposing anything better. Laymen have never heard of public key cryptography (even though they use it probably dozens of times a day), they won't know what a private key is.
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:36:06
It's much easier to just go about doing this yourself. Far, far more secure to buy bitcoin through whatever means is easiest, then use your own client-side wallet software to send BTC to whatever address you want.
You don't specifically need a middleman to take your card payment and send BTC for you, that's the cool thing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:24:08
Obviously that depends on the wallet and their developers. Most eventually did with the recent fork at the beginning of the month. Some haven't yet and some never will. But what the wallets do or don't do is irrelevant; if you have bitcoin in a wallet that is truly yours, you can always just use another wallet to transact with it. Wallets are just an interface, bitcoin isn't stored there.


It doesn't.

Bitcoin lacks unnecessary flashy features by design. It is meant to be a robust, redundant, highly secure protocol. Slowish blocks with extraordinarily high proof of work cost. Can you do cheaper PoW or some alternative for faster confirmation? Of course you can. Can you add on a whole slew of totally pointless features that no one actually wants to use at the protocol level? Sure.
Doing so though will utterly compromise the security strength of your cryptocurrency.
Turns out nobody wants a coin with ten thousand detachable multitool components that can tell the time from the orbital spin of a blue whale's mating call. The market wants a highly immutable blockchain.

There's no excuse for that level of narcissism.

Thank you for not being a stupid noob. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away in this thread. Tons of us will be happy to help. Please be sure to read the sidebar thoroughly, there's so much information to be found in those links that your friends and family might think you're dead in the next week or two.

You don't have any bitcoins. They did.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:35:23
No, probably not. Next time, try to understand that with cryptocurrency, the cryptography *is* the bitcoin. Throwing away the private keys, or whatever information controls them (like the seed phrase), is the same as throwing away your money.

Learn skills in your free time that will get you somewhere in life ahead of your peers.
Learn widely-spoken languages that interest you. Learn as much about computers as you can possibly absorb. Learn some hands-on skills that you find fun as a hobby; for me it was welding and electrical stuff but woodworking is also fantastic and easy to start from zero with. And artistic talents are nothing to scoff at either if you have the patience to get really good.
Right now you have time and energy but no money. When that equation changes, you can easily get trapped in an annoying cycle where you make some money but have very little time and energy left over day to day to improve your situation. Don't end up stuck in that trap like most people.

That is a mind bogglingly stupid argument. For the Bitcoin protocol to change so fundamentally that it's no longer even using public key cryptography, it will no longer be anything at all like Bitcoin.
The entire point of a blockchain is that transactions point back to previous transactions in a cryptographically secure manner. You can't change that and still have a blockchain. You can't change the way the public key cryptography of the chain works and still keep a cryptographically valid Ledger starting from the genesis block.

Https is irrelevant. It can change all it wants, just like many other protocols for internet traffic in use today. Backwards compatibility is *nice* for such purposes, but not necessary.
You said "no", and the question is "will this keypair be compatible". You're 100% wrong, don't try to dance around that. Nobody cares how obscured the keypairs may become to the average user. It's irrelevant to the question.

You're not at all like me in that you're a gigantic asshole on discussion forums.
It's literally the rules of the site. I don't care how you feel about it. You are supposed to read the sidebar information and use the search bar first. If you can't find what you're looking for, *then* you post. The vast, overwhelming majority of posts to this subreddit nowadays fail this criteria.

It's called change. The very short gist is that when you send BTC, you have to totally spend an address; so what your software does is it spends however much you intended to send to the recipient, and sends the rest "back" to you at a new address (or an old one, you can do it however you want, but most modern wallets will always generate a new change address for you).


We are unfortunately in an extremely atypical state of the network right now.


You can always receive. You never need any internet connection at all in your lifetime just to get bitcoin.


Sort of for the former, yes to the latter. The public key gets cryptographically hashed into the Bitcoin address first, and that's what you receive BTC to. Think of it like giving your email out to people.
Go read about public key cryptography to get a better understanding. This is a universally used technology that has been tried and tested for half a century now.

It's somewhat more secure but by no means foolproof against malware. Something will eventually just spoof the credentials.
The only real security with a second factor device is by using a hardware wallet. That way there's no harm done even if malware is interfering with your wallet. It won't be able to steal your private keys and can't trick you into spending to the wrong address.

lol that was pretty funny.
You said some very silly things and your idea is still a bit foolish. You're banking entirely on bitcoin continuing to rise indefinitely and not failing or at least losing its spot at the top of the food chain.
Just because I believe in that and most of us here do too doesn't mean you should bet your whole future on it. I know you're a smart guy, that's why I'm bothering to even carry on this conversation with you, because I like your spirit and outlook on life and admire your tenacity and appetite for some risk.
But smart people make very stupid decisions.
Earning bitcoin right now isn't even a great market honestly. Not too many people have it and the sort that do don't like to spend much, especially on generally frivolous things. You're better off earning petty cash and using that to build up some savings while investing a small percentage of that into cryptocurrency.
You may not think another sudden financial problem will come your way anytime soon. Nobody ever thinks that. Life is a bitch. I don't care how much crypto you have, you will feel really dumb and really angry if you need fiat and can't get it fast enough, and you will make poor investment decisions as a result of stress and emotion.

You should learn to use Reddit instead of berating people who took time out of their day to help you. It is literally against the rules of the site to do what you are doing, asking dumb questions without reading the FAQ or sidebar info or searching first, and we answered your bad questions anyway. You can fuck right off with your entitled attitude.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:49:35
Your question isn't very smart.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:49:12
lol this shill is a fun one.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:04:02
If you think six confirmations is too long, why are you currently willing to wait a month for transactions to settle with your bank?
Because you're ignorant and you don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:15:25
It's somewhat pointless. Your seed and this all funds that will ever touch that wallet are already as compromised as your computer you used to generate the seed.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:58:03
You don't have any bitcoin, you have expensive IOUs if they're in an exchange.
Jaxx is a bad choice for a wallet for the reason you stated, but at least it's a client-side wallet where you actually have bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:15:47
Confirmations are fast. The target time for confirmations is a very ideal compromise between usability and absolutely unbearable security.
It's the fees that bother you, you just don't want to look at it that way for some reason. But for sure if the fee to guarantee a confirmation in the next block was a penny, you would probably not be here complaining about "transfer speeds".
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:00:04
Okay, cool, opportunity cost exists. You realize, smart guy, that this is true whether you pay in fiat or bitcoin?
If I buy something with $100 in USD, I could have also used that $100 to buy the equivalent in BTC, with exactly the same possibility that it would reach $200 of value later on. What currency you actually spend in is utterly irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:27:09
Makes sense. That seems sketchy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:23:21
Stupid questions get stupid answers.

You don't have a Trezor "account".

You don't have any bitcoin if it's not in a wallet you and only you control. Have fun with your extremely expensive IOUs.

Begging is not allowed.

Frankly, this should be the core problem you should be dedicating your attention towards. Especially considering you don't make enough to have any money left over even just for measly fiat savings, let alone crypto investment.
Don't allow yourself this distraction. You don't need it. You will fall into the same exact problem again shortly anyway, having to sell off what you have. No guarantee that the price won't be crashing down at that time, and you'll be pissed as hell thinking bitcoin screwed you and you'll curse your fate.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you will be able to make more bitcoin faster than you'd have any luck integrating into the traditional economy with widely accepted skills. All the power to you, if that's the case. But if I were you, I'd stop chasing the crypto for now and focus on your more immediate problem.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:42:45
You can't meaningfully enforce such a stupid idea even if people thought it would be a good idea. The protocol is open source and freely distributed, which means there's no way to control or even keep track of nodes.
If you want a closed, shitty, unfree currency, you should use Ripple.

@_date: 2017-08-14 20:36:04
What you're saying makes as much sense as "I want to buy groceries but I heard that X grocery store is a bad place to farm vegetables?"
Buying and selling BTC should be completely separate from how you keep it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:51:46
The problem is that you are voluntarily and naively giving someone else your bitcoin for literally no reason at all.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:03:08
You are far more likely to lose everything to the third party you're trusting to hold your coins for a stop loss scenario than the market crashing drastically and never recovering back up. The former has happened countless times, the latter has always ended up being just a small dip in a massively upward curve.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:29:21
You are literally panic selling over nothing. This is what every week looks like and has looked like for years.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:59:01
You should be very reasonably knowledgeable about every possible sort of malware threat that could affect the creation of your wallet and how you're planning to protect against it.

If you have at least read the links in the sidebar, you are not the dumb useless noob I am talking about.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:38:29
Coinbase is not your wallet. It is Coinbase's wallet, where they own bitcoin. You don't own any bitcoin in their wallet, you will only have some pretty IOUs.
Blockchain and any other web wallet is a terrible idea. Don't trust your private keys being stored and transmitted by any third party, ever. No exceptions.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:19:14
Because putting your money in someone else's pocket is completely stupid.

It's called BTC, not Before Christ.
Yes, that is indeed how basic arithmetic works.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:40:04
You could start by not being a useless noob and reading the sidebar.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:38:27
The con is that you don't have any bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:45:08
Oh no, someone might get their feelings hurt. Wouldn't want that.
That's definitely much more ducking important than the constant flood of new guys here making phenomenally stupid decisions with their money that inevitably results in being robbed.

The gigantic and glaring elephant in the room is immutability. The bank, the government, hackers, a disgruntled employee or communist, a glitch... any random third party at all... could arbitrarily at any time stop any transaction you have tried to make at all without any cause for doing so, long after you perceive the transaction as having gone through.
It's completely apples to oranges.

Don't be jealous cuz I've been trading crypto all day.
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:05:32


Account or sub-accounts aren't actual things that exist in any way outside of whatever your specific wallet software decides, it has nothing to do with actual bitcoin really. It's just whatever helpful way your wallet might let you organize your addresses as you choose.
There are addresses and there are wallets. You use new addresses for every transaction for best privacy practices.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:33:10
No, no, no. Waaaaay colder, you were much closer to the right idea a comment ago.
You should go and read more about what the blockchain actually is and what a fork means, this will all make a lot more sense to you once you understand what a fork actually means in terms of the chain.
Basically, imagine that you have an account with Bank of America or something. BoA says you have $5k sitting in your account. Suddenly, quite out of the blue one Wednesday morning, BoA splits in half in a bloody civil war over a dispute about the use of the microwave in the break room; thousands die. Now there's two entities that each think they're the *real* BoA; maybe they both use the original name, maybe one slightly changes it, or maybe both; it doesn't matter in the least.
But both BoAs now acknowledge the $5k in your account, only, they don't share the same information anymore. Neither cares what the other BoA says is happening to your money anymore. If you go to BoA-1 and withdraw a hundred bucks, your BoA-2 account will not reflect his change in anyway.
Imagine now that you're a very confused BoA customer. You've always just used your closest local branch for routine banking needs and you have no idea what's going on. Well it turns out that local branch is now controlled by BoA-1. They don't even tell you what's going on, that BoA-2 even exists, and they certainly don't tell you that you now own basically a clone account over at the other enemy branches. But you do.
All you have to do is go over to a BoA-2 branch, show them you're the account owner in some way, and in every way you can use that account as if nothing ever happened. As if BoA-2 had been the same original BoA all along. While also doing the same on BoA-1 if you'd like.

Your proof is the same proof you use transacting on the regular bitcoin network. Cryptography. Read about public key cryptography to understand how that works. Check out the Bitcoin wiki to understand exactly how it's used in the Bitcoin network in terms of addresses.

Why am I the only person left with any respect for the basic rules that uphold a good discussion forum?
Sure, letting every lazy noob ask the same question over and over and over and over and over again is great for them. Zero effort, everything handed to them on a silver platter. I don't care about what's good for lazy noobs.

That's absolutely not how anything in life works. Reality is much more boring than that. 
People generally build wealth slowly over time by choosing to delay gratification, saving as much money as humanly possible and investing in their future potential to earn more money later on, avoiding high risk of any sort, and building up networks of high trust and cooperation.

There are countless ways of buying bitcoin. I'm forced to assume that your assumption is buying through an exchange. Sure, yeah. People have had accounts hacked and funds stolen. Another good reason not to have any money sitting in there.

It's even crazier than that—there's nothing to "open" or "close". You can just generate new addresses at will, infinitely. And reuse any address you have used or not used previously again at any time.

Don't listen to this idiot. A third party custodial service holding coins for you is not the same as owning bitcoin. Don't settle for IOUs.
Literally the entire purpose of cryptocurrency is the ability to use cryptography to create and use a system of currency. Giving somebody else your coins and hoping they don't rob you is both mind-numbingly retarded and also completely against the entire point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:27:50
The entire point of the seed is to be randomly generated. Anything you set yourself will be orders of magnitude less random.

Change is not always the better option. People value gold exactly for the reason that it does not change.
The entire point for the vast majority of people speculating in Bitcoin is as a store of value. Serious changes to the protocol threaten that. Nobody wants "innovation" for the sake of "innovation.

It's akin to the gold-grabbing back in the day. It would be so blatantly transparent, the panic would be insane. People who have barely heard of bitcoin and even the ones who were calling it a Ponzi scheme yesterday would flock en masse to get their hands on some.

Because the pro-Core crowd don't see Bitcoin Cash as being meaningfully bitcoin in the sense they care about, so hodl doesn't apply to BCH for them; it's the same as trying to tell them to hodl any altcoin. They don't see any long-term value to it.
Personally I sold some BCH recently for other alts and I'm holding the rest in case my instinct is wrong.

There is no "the fee". You choose to pay whatever fee you want. How much you pay, given the size of your transaction and the traffic on the network at the time, gives you a good idea of how quickly you can expect your tx to be mined in a block.

Online bitcoin wallet is an oxymoron. It isn't your wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:28:30
You pretty much just answered all of your questions.
You can encrypt your private key with a passphrase, and many wallets have a functionality for that. It's not mandatory.
Yeah, any private key can be used with other software.
The last one is much simpler than that. With a third party device, you don't have any bitcoin, just IOUs. Look at MtGox, or BTC-E more recently. Millions flushed down the drain instantly because stupid noobs thought putting their money in a middleman's pocket was a great idea.

You're welcome.
I think the best way to actually understand bitcoin once you understand its mechanisms is to learn as much as you can about fiat currencies. Most people when they encounter cryptocurrency have to main problems, generally. The first is that the math concepts behind it can be intimidating and confusing. But the second larger and more common problem is that it tends to break people's core assumptions and deeply held beliefs about what money *is*, and they realize that it's something they've never actually understood in the first place.
Learn as much as you can about how the government manipulates the money supply, interest rates, and the whole monetary system. It's horrifying.

...? What? I never said a word about fees. I don't care about the fees associated with those services, I just don't want to "spend" bitcoin that's not actually spending bitcoin. There's absolutely no point in spending bitcoin rather than fiat if it isn't going to even encourage vendors to adopt bitcoin. Using gift cards bought with BTC or debit cards that trade by BTC for fiat to then pass to the vendor completely defeat that purpose. I might as well just spend fiat directly if that's the idea.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:15:11
Welcome. You'll be fine, man. Sometimes you'll buy real cheap like you did, other times not as great a bargain, but as long as you see the lasting value still there and your nerves are calm, you should stay safe. A crash to zero is unlikely; panic selling during a dip and losing lots of money, though, is common and this subreddit gets flooded with posts by weak hands who do so every time.

Beginners and mining don't mix well. Do yourself a very wise favor and forget about trying to mine. Read all you want about it until you have a really solid understanding of how it works and how one might be able to generate a profit from it. Read up on the current state of the market and who dominates it. Then perhaps one day you might come back to that idea and actually be in a more informed position to try to get into it.

Again, *fees are voluntary*. Holy shit. I don't know how much I need to explain that to you. You were ignorant of how the network or your own wallet works, so you sent out a transaction without checking how much you were paying in fees. That's your own carelessness, nobody forced you to do that. It's not a mandatory charge.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:52:03
Because you're asking silly questions that would've been clarified by a very simple use of the search function or even just googling bitcoin mining and looking for a recent source.
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:51:25
Fees are completely optional, you can pay zero.
You need to know how much data your transaction is to calculate how much you should pay.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:49:26
It's not a matter of when. Time nothing to do with it per se. If you know what you're doing you could try it immediately. The problem is that almost nobody else will know what they're doing and will want to send or receive coins they don't understand.

@_date: 2017-07-10 21:03:42
Exactly. It's a technology that changes the distribution not of wealth but of power, like firearms did for combat. With modern cryptography, regular civilians can easily train in how to safeguard not just their information and communication, but now even their money. We've never had anything like this before. Will lots of people ignore it and choose to still be slaves? Of course. Human nature probably tends towards lazy complacency. But now the tool is there for those who want to use it, and there's no going back from that.
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:41:12
Your first few questions make no sense, you don't seem to understand what a wallet is.
Don't use web wallets. Using Coinbase or any other exchange to buy bitcoin is (relatively) fine. Keeping it there is retarded, it defeats the entire purpose of cryptocurrency. Read about Mt. Gox if you want to know more about why that would be a stupid thing to do.
Get yourself some other kind of wallet. Bitcoin.org has a very nice list with pros and cons of various kinds of wallets. Familiarize yourself with the differences between web wallets, hot versus cold storage, hardware wallets, et cetera.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:49:04
I mean, it's a super economy setting. If anything, you've just been getting lucky until now.
But there's no way for anybody to meaningfully answer this without knowing any information about the actual transaction. It may have just involved an unusually high number of inputs/outputs.
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:24:37
Literally anything is possible with regards to price. Anybody who claims to know the future is lying. You're better off making up your own mind based on your best understanding of bitcoin. Listening to other people's arbitrary predictions is pointless.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:46:21
You haven't read enough. You're getting close now but you still don't really seem to get it. The whole point is that it's trivial now to hide in plain sight and getting easier every day. No, you can't just spot crypto stuff just like that and you can't just incentivize ISPs enough to do it. It's becoming literally impossible very quickly. You would have to indiscriminately shut down all traffic, you can't just spot and pick out what you're looking for anymore.
The other main issue that quickly comes up is jurisdiction. The federal government can't just ban all traffic outside of the country but that would be the only way to stop encrypted anonymous routing if they somehow even did magically manage to shut down every node in the U.S., which is already infeasible.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:29:45
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:56:59
No, not necessarily. Like I said, it depends on how securely you generate the paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:40:33
That is a terrible idea begging for malware to spread across that kind of vulnerability. There's no need to send anything over bluetooth. QR codes are already completely ubiquitous in every wallet app out there. The customer just scans the code and confirms the tx; takes like two seconds.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:08:22
That's an accurate assessment but I'm not convinced that would be a bad thing. Encouraging investment sounds like an absolute ideal because it sounds nice in our heads, but the reality is that is that by trying to encourage it beyond its natural limits of what expected returns on investment are in any given market, through tax returns or inflation or controlling interest rates or whatever, you only end up setting up a dangerous scenario of overinvestment in riskier and riskier loans and startups, because people at that point would rather put their money into almost anything rather than keep it and lose value.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:09:39

Take some time away from cryptocurrency. Not long, just enough to build up more fiat savings until you can comfortably afford to move around $2k and not end up unable to pay rent because of it. You are deeply overinvested.

The only reasonable assumption is that a group of people with lots of resources were intentionally trying to make it appear like the network was naturally becoming congested to the point of full capacity. We can deduce this because A, they didn't announce their attack in any way so they didn't want the community to know it was an attack. B, the scale of the spam is insanely expensive so we know they're well-funded. And C, the timing of the attack coincides with monumental changes being debated in the community that would negatively affect the income of some extremely well-funded individuals who also have the technical resources and ability to carry out precisely this type of attack, as well as the coordination to do so secretly and cooperatively.
Conclusion: a group of miners tried very expensively to trick the Bitcoin community and it didn't work.

The problem is that by trying to open that Pandora's box, you've then created every incentive for not just miners, but any potential cartel of developers, miners, node operators or just Bitcoin-related companies to push changes to the protocol which allow for greater centralization, more central planning of protocol changes where important decisions are made as shadowy deals between powerful cartels, and inflation would be once again controlled as a centralized policy.
You don't want to try going down that road. Any cryptocurrency that tries to do so will fail. Nobody wants this. If we wanted it, we'd stick with the dollar.

Not as much as you think, really. You don't have to be a brilliant developer to be able to analyze some basic things about a program. It's fairly trivial, for example, to learn how to analyze data traffic coming in and out of your computer to check if programs running on it are being honest and not sending or receiving anything they're not supposed to.

It's still just a caesar cipher, all you need is a decoder that can work with numbers and letters and you'll break it in the blink of an eye. All you have to do is get your program to take that ciphered private key and try every variation of shifting its letters and numbers a certain amount up or down, or just the letters, just the numbers, or some minor variations. These are trivial computations.

If the wallet you transfer to only takes the transaction as BTC but not BCC, think of what it looks like on the other side of the fork. According to BTC, the coins have moved to your hardware wallet. Normal. Easy.
According to the BCC chain though, the coins never moved. You would need to import the address you want to spend from into a wallet that can spend BCC if that's what you want to do.
But if you don't care about using the BCC you have then you don't have to worry about doing a damn thing.

Currency has two important functions; these are actually the exact same function, it's just a sleight of hand that makes them appear different at all. Currency is a medium of exchange, and a store of value; the only difference is the scale of time we're talking about in between. A very "hot" currency, we could say, would be something like a world in which no one has any savings; they earn what they earn and spend it all by their next paycheck. Bitcoin is like gold today, it's the opposite of that. Still a currency, just a very "cold" one. It's meant to retain value over a long term.
It's still a function of currency. But our world today has largely given up on long term value as a foregone conclusion. This doesn't have to be the case. Loss of value due to unchecked inflation does not have to be our reality.

We should get paid considering how many fucking customer support requests we get on this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:33:39
It's super easy, actually.
The harder thing that most business owners want to do is get a system going with a service like Bitpay, where a customer can pay in bitcoin, and then it is immediately paid to Bitpay who immediately pays out the equivalent price in fiat currency to the vendor. Still not particularly hard, but you know, it depends on what country you live in, the currency you want, you're gonna pay a flat 1% fee, etc...
What he wants to do is so easy that he could get started in under five minutes. It's literally a matter of downloading an app on your phone which will set up a private wallet for you. A wallet is just a fancy way of referring to addresses (think like an email address, you need it to send someone an email; same for bitcoin), and the private keys that control them.
Most wallets nowadays generate all the private keys and addresses they use from a 12 or 24 word random phrase that you have to write down somewhere and keep safe; with these words you will always be able to recover your wallet even if you lose the device, or even if that particular software goes away, you could use another similar app and it will work the same way.
Anyway, here's how a simple transaction works, more or less. Let's say you just want somebody to pay you in bitcoin, face-to-face. You whip out your smartphones or whatever devices. You pull up a screen on your wallet app that shows a receiving address which will be presented as a QR code. The other guy takes their app, it reads the QR code with the camera and decodes the address. You can even set up the QR code so that it even suggests to the sender the amount of the payment requested just so it's already there when they scan it, it's crazy convenient. The sender reviews the transaction info on their screen (check the address looks right, the amount, a few details about transaction fees to make sure the payment will be confirmed in a timely manner). They hit send. Their wallet might require them to type in a PIN, a password, use a thumbprint, or whatever. You're done.
Paying in bitcoin works the same way, of course, in reverse. Online payments are much the same. Instead of scanning a QR code you can copy-paste or even manually type an address.
Mycelium (iOS &amp; Android), Breadwallet (only iOS), Copay (both?), and Greenbits (dunno, never used it) are some of the best apps I'm aware of, but there are others.

Why did you keep it in Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:10:20
No. However small a fraction of time passes between sending one transaction out to the next translates to a huge advantage in the first transaction reaching many more nodes than the first. Without trying to spend a higher fee to get it included ahead of the first, there's really no serious chance at all that it will win out. But even a higher fee won't really get you your double spend most likely. Miners don't blindly like to allow that kind of behavior, they'll usually ignore a second transaction that would contradict an earlier one in this scenario, even with a higher fee, because they spot it as a double spend attempt and don't much like people trying to cheat the system.
To be sure you'll get it done, you've got to control some serious hashrate and try to mine it yourself.

The other interesting aspect to this question that hasn't been answered yet is that right now Google already probably could *barely* afford to buy into a reasonable section of the market. They would certainly *not* be able to establish themselves immediately, and probably not ever, as the monopoly or even the largest player in the market. It is already far too expensive to do so.
When the network first began, let's say there were around ten people mining. To dominate the market and be the winner who gets to mine every block, it maybe only required a very modest advantage. So if one guy bought a faster computer than the other guys, he quickly became the fastest horse in the race at very little cost. But with every added block in the chain, there's a timer. Periodically, the mining difficulty rises. It's designed this way so that over time, less and less bitcoin will be created until finally there's no more new bitcoin.
This makes it more and more difficult for anyone to gain an edge in the mining market. Every day it gets more competitive, and getting a slight advantage in computing speed becomes more expensive. It is already at a stage where trying to buy your way into the market is already prohibitively expensive for even governments to try to manipulate this market. Right now the only government making any real effort to do so is China, and even they will not be able to keep this up forever.

They're present, in a crony market where corporate giants have an uneven advantage to throw the full weight of the legal system against competitors, so they're crony. They're not crony just for being giant, no. But giants in a crony market are probably almost always crony.


Did you mean decentralized? And anyway, no, I still disagree. Your using a definition of decentralized I don't even remotely agree with, one based on an outcome you desire and not based on protocol itself or any meaningful standards. You want the protocol and the market to change to whatever is necessary to make individual miners dominate again, I want a protocol and market that is fair and I'm happy with whatever outcome results from that.

It's different because it's decentralized and completely in your own control. No government can send a letter and confiscate your bitcoin. No one can decide to inflate the money supply. No one can forge transactions.
It's not meant to "solve" income inequality because income inequality is a red herring. It's not a cause of social problems, it's just one possible symptom of it. People having more money than others isn't a bad thing. All societies inherently trend towards some kind of inequality or another. The problem is when that difference in wealth translates to an abusive control of political power.
With bitcoin, there is no mechanism for wealthy people to control anything about money. They can't inflate the currency to devalue your savings. They can't confiscate your savings because they arbitrarily decide your profession is illegal or you now owe more taxes. They can't control your money.

Educate yourself about what a blockchain is and how it works. When we talk about data, we're not talking about your cell phone or internet bill and that sense of data usage. We're talking about how transactions get mined into blocks. It's a limited resource.

@_date: 2017-07-27 23:13:59

Just the same way that a mugger doesn't automatically know how much cash you have on you, but will know to target somebody who's flaunting their wealth obviously, nobody who tries to rob you would automatically expect you to have immediate access to a huge fortune unless they know you're rich.

They'll put out a firmware update and just like with ethereum (I'm guessing it works this way, I personally use a Ledger device), you have to choose between ETC or ETH when initializing your wallet so it knows what to do with your wallet in checking for balances and sending transactions. Same would be done for bitcoin in the event of a hard fork, probably also for a soft one.
If not, you would have to resort to using your seed words on a different wallet that does support the forked bitcoin. For example, if Trezor decides not to do the right thing but Ledger does, you have the option of cloning your same wallet on a Ledger.

Comparing it to, say, Visa transactions around the world still would not even be a fair comparison, because all of these traditional types of digital fiat transactions have chargeback features that make payment reversible and risky. The equivalent to bitcoin mining isn't just the electric cost to send and receive transactions, it's also the verification tool used to make transactions irreversible and legitimate, so it's effectively equivalent to everything banks do with your money for thirty or so days. Plus it mints new currency, so add in the entire electric cost of the Federal Reserve.

Nodes listen for new unconfirmed transactions and spread them to the rest of their peers so that in this way, the whole network quickly hears about them. Then for new blocks just recently put out, once they receive a new block they immediately get to work verifying the cryptographic validity of the block and if it checks out, they accept it as the chain unless a better chain comes to light.

There is absolutely *zero* reason the same would not probably happen with a standard official wallet. If anything, I'd argue there's more risk, because bearing some stamp of official authority would make more users gravitate towards it and trust it implicitly, leading to a great risk of a second MtGox type of incident.


Virtually everything in the cryptocurrency world has been open source from the beginning. It makes no sense at all to trust software to do what it claims to do in order to use a trustless network! That would truly defeat the purpose.

Two issues with that. First, the more complex you make your weird system, the harder it is to remember and the more tempting it is to keep a record of that method somewhere so you won't forget it.

Don't get me wrong, the banks are scum of the earth. But if you don't have an actual understanding of what cryptocurrency is and how it works, your opinion is worthless because you have no way to ground your fear in anything real.

Don't listen to the other guy, he's kind of a moron. There is absolutely no need to get way into the weeds and try to run a Core wallet yourself when you don't have the kind of technical skills necessary.
You don't want to keep your funds in BitGo simply because there's no good reason to do so, and it's an unnecessary risk. Bitcoin isn't like dollars, there's no good reason to leave them in someone else's possession for safekeeping. BitGo is not going to be much better than you (if you do a very modest amount of research) at safekeeping your cryptocurrency; on the other hand, all kinds of exchanges have had very turbulent histories of outright stealing users' funds, being hacked resulting in theft of funds, being shut down by governments and having funds frozen, intentionally freezing users' funds for various reasons with no real recourse... and so on.
In short, you could potentially lose everything you have. If it's not in a wallet you control, I would go as far as to say that you do not have any bitcoin. You have bitcoin IOUs.

You can't change the ledger. Trying to modify any transaction information invalidates the hashes of the rest of the chain, all you need is one correctly functioning node to see this.
The protocol is quantum resistant. Even with a theoretical machine that can crack an s-key from a p-key very fast, you still have to reverse the hash to first derive a public key from a Bitcoin address if it has not yet been spent from.
@_date: 2017-07-14 04:50:12

The fees are not worse than with Coinbase so you're still better off than leaving them there.

Because you don't have any bitcoin on Coinbase; *Coinbase* has bitcoins and you have IOUs from them.
As for blockchain, the situation is a little muddier. You're able to extract the private keys of the wallet holding your BTC so you have some degree of control, but you still have to trust Blockchain to be benevolent and not steal your funds intentionally, trust their server's security against hackers, trust the government not to shut them down and confiscate your funds, trust the security of the data transmission across the internet without a man in the middle interception, trust your browser's security, and trust your computer at the other end.

Hypothetically your banking information can get hacked and leaked, I guess. Realistically that has probably already happened to you at least a few times without your knowledge; you've handed out your financial information of this kind to every merchant you've ever swiped your card with and every site online you do shopping on. In reality it's not a big risk since you can easily claim fraud, charge back the amount taken, and your money is easily returned.
The risk is far greater on their end than yours. You may try to scam the exchange and charge back the transaction from your bank. That's why they make you wait before giving you the BTC.


It is. I don't understand how you still don't see that. Nothing about your complaints have anything at all to do with bitcoin, it would be the same issue buying any kind of asset remotely with the traditional banking infrastructure. And then the second you have bitcoin and want to use it, all of these stupid problems go away. Doesn't matter where the person you want to send BTC to is located. Doesn't matter how little or how much. Doesn't matter what kind of computer they have, what operating system they run, what language they speak, if it's legal or illegal... what matters is the amount, the addresses, and maybe attach a good fee if the network is a bit crowded. Done.
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:52:02
Well the first answer is a lot easier, you literally just have to look at a chart of the price of BTC-USD over time since its start and see that even with the biggest crash in its history, it recovered its value very quickly, and year by year it has blown away expectations every single time and somehow manages to keep on climbing. The people who lose a lot are the ones trying to maximize profits on buying low and selling high on all the BTC they have, and they stand to lose a lot on just one or two bad trades. But those who have simply bought even just a year or two ago and held onto it have seen their value rise immensely. There's nothing else like it in the market right now at all, where you can make that kind of gain just by buying and holding onto an asset.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:43:56
You have some of the private keys, and Coinbase holds the others. More control than the average Coinbase user has because you can move them without waiting for Coinbase's approval to a wallet you fully control. But Coinbase could also do the same. You are trusting them not to maliciously rob you, or freeze your account for any arbitrary reason, or get shut down by the government or some other entity who freezes your account or steals your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-08 08:16:56

Can't send it anywhere unless I hand deliver it myself, across the street or across the globe, without trusting a middleman.
But sure, the shiny rock has intrinsic value.

No. It was the same since the very beginning. You can have bitcoins, or you can have worthless IOUs from an exchange. That's been true since the very beginning and remains true now.

@_date: 2017-07-11 01:40:38
But let's assume, for example, that you generated that paper address on the same computer as your desktop wallet. You're still using the same potentially compromised device for both wallets, even if your paper wallet isn't generated by the same software as your desktop wallet. Both eggs are still in the same basket, you're just deluding yourself into thinking the paper wallet is somehow more secure. You're not inherently more secure by using a paper wallet, it's only as secure as the method you use to generate it! Hell, arguably it could be more exposed if you're concerned about a hacker accessing the printer you used for the paper wallet, or if you simply used bitaddress.org or some clone while online in the browser to create the paper wallet then you still have to trust the site to not be watching your key generation.
Plus keeping any in an exchange is just mentally retarded. That's not hedging your bets, that's just willingly surrendering your money.

@_date: 2017-07-12 03:19:48
Austrian economists argue that the irony of Keynesian economics is that monetary policies are what *cause* boom and bust cycles in the first place, when trust in all these risky investments come back to bite us in the ass all at the same time and suddenly nobody wants to invest anymore even at the cost of suffering inflation because there's just too much mismanaged risk.
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:17:35
Sure, but again, you're still in a silly scenario. There's no way that all of your options are all equally risky. If I had to rank them all, I'd say that a paper wallet is the safest (only if you use a one-time use computer that will never in a million years connect to the internet, and destroy the printer after use or are 1000% certain it retains no memory of what it printed though), followed by hardware wallet, then by a significant drop in security you have smartphone wallets, followed by desktop wallets. And then I'd classify having an IOU for bitcoins on exchanges as something else entirely; you don't have any bitcoins there, just promises.
So it doesn't make sense to distribute your eggs evenly among all your baskets if some are made of glass.

If you're asking how much you would have if you had bought 20 bucks worth of bitcoin at the price of $333/BTC, that's a different question.

$2550/$333 = $7.65

...ah. Not much you can to do protect against fear of missing out, I guess.
Best advice I can give you might be to set yourself a steady budget for cryptocurrency every month and stick to it. Let yourself choose when to use it. That way, say you know you can only spend up to $500. Okay, but you can still watch the market a bit, try to get the most bitcoin for that fiat. That way you can stay involved but you can know when you've hit your limit. Stick to your plan and don't overinvest or you will end up trading on fear.

No, they cannot. Read about onion and garlic routing, end-to-end encryption, TCP-IP infrastructure...
The gist of it is that no, you cannot just block whatever you want on the internet these days. You more or less have to find every server one by one and shut them down, and with property operational security practices and obfuscation techniques, this could prove to be impossible.

Depends on your goals! Bitcoin infrastructure these days is at a point where it's reliable to spend for lots of goods and services.
You can try your hand and trading BTC for profit. I'd suggest not going in too heavily, only buying and selling a modest portion of your holdings.
You can hedge your bitcoin investment by looking into other altcoins and if you believe any have short or long term value, try your hand and trading those. These days there's tons of services just for trading between cryptocurrencies.
You can cash out all or most and look into more traditional investment options if cryptocurrency feels too risky for you.

There are probably at least a hundred ways people commonly buy and sell BTC in some way for fiat. A very lucrative field is buying and selling gift cards for BTC and reselling them online for fiat but of course that can be quite a gamble and may also take some time depending on what sites you use or how trustworthy they may be.
There's Bitcoin ATMs out there. People buy and sell for cash face-to-face, buy with money orders, checks, paypal... the list is endless. You really are going to have to narrow down what you're looking for. Problem is, to most people anyway, almost everything is going to be more expensive than just a bank account transfer.

You need to forget about this. Mining BTC for a noob is a really really stupid idea. It isn't for beginner's anymore, you will lose a lot of money. The kind of ASICs you need to try mining are incredibly expensive. You stand a good chance of never even breaking even on your investment, let alone generating serious profit.
I have yet to see any small-time miner make more money from mining than they would have simply buying and holding BTC for the same amount as their initial investment plus electricity and maintenance costs.

It's a very dumb question but that's what you do as a beginner, you ask dumb questions and you learn. No worries.
Your wallet doesn't actually "receive" anything. Bitcoin is transferred from one address to another. When you "receive" bitcoin, the blockchain has updated to include a transaction that sends some amount of BTC from somewhere to an address in your control. You don't need to do a thing. You only need your private keys in order to spend them.

You don't have to do anything. A hardware wallet is like having a safe in your house. If you're thinking about getting one, it probably means you should get one because that's a good indication that you have enough value that it's worth investing in solid protection.
You can download and run a client-side wallet on pretty much any operating system platform out there. Smartphone cross-platform wallets for iOS and Android are ubiquitous. Windows, Mac, and Linux programs are also very popular. These all absolutely work and offer different degrees of security. But if you're looking for true peace of mind, nothing beats a hardware wallet.

Absolutely false. It is used for tons of other cases already.

You can instantly pay someone across any border any amount without any need to deal with government or financial intermediaries. And so on and so on and so on. Anonymity is not even one of the stronger features of bitcoin as of right now, there are better cryptocurrencies for this purpose!

It's literally third grade multiplication, dude. You just need a somewhat more advanced wallet than a lot of beginners prefer but it's not like you necessarily need to run a Core node or anything like that.
You need a wallet that shows you the data size of the transaction you want to send. Then check a couple of sites that calculate the suggested fee size for you. Decide to pay what you think is fair for how long you're hoping to wait for confirmation. Remember that you may be trying to do it at a peak traffic time, or asshole miner cartels may be trying to spam the network again; consider waiting a little while to check again later if the fees are absurd.
Probably the reason you are seeing high fees is because the BTC you have is in smallish amounts split up into various addresses, and this drives up the data size and thus fees when you try to spend it into one larger payment. The trick is to combine these addresses into one sometime before you need to spend it, when you can afford to wait a long time for confirmations. That way when you do need to spend it fast and cheaply, your fee is dirt cheap because it's an easy 1-1 transaction.

Short answer is that you need a wallet that gives you control, and no one else, to your own private keys. You need to learn how to figure out what that means and what wallets will do that. We can lead you to water but only you can make yourself drink.

Mycelium for iOS is fine, I have no idea why that commenter thought there should be an issue with it.
Learn to read yourself. No one can choose for you. You need to get to a point where you can research a wallet yourself, understand the features it has and doesn't have, and decide based on your own knowledge what is a smart, secure choice.
Don't just take me or anyone else at their word, dude. Random people pretty much never have any idea what you're talking about.

You're very, very, *very* far from the first person to conceive of this idea. That's not meant to be any kind of insult or to discourage you, I'm just letting you know that the idea has been put out there many, many times and heavily discussed among cryptography enthusiasts.
It just hasn't really had much of a chance to be tried out yet, like lots of blockchain implementations, for lots of reasons. Mainly because it's still very early in the game, frankly. To insiders it may feel like bitcoin is old news now and the altcoin explosion is pretty old too, but to regular folks, most people have hardly heard of bitcoin, never really even heard the term "blockchain" and wouldn't be able to understand how or why it works even if you tried to explain it to them (because explaining a distributed ledger is useless unless you understand how public key cryptography + proof of work makes it immutable).
Some distant day in the future, actual governments and actual corporations could be built (hell, I'd even say *must*) on such a model, but for now the best we can do is to try to set up experimental organizations that work this way. I could see small-scale organizations implementing a blockchain voting system at least just as proof of concept.

Yes and yes! You're much smarter than you give yourself credit for, you basically have the idea of it. The only way to properly guarantee that nobody could ever steal the information they'd need to steal your bitcoin, when using paper wallets, is to use a computer that will never go online, and a dumb printer that can't store the images.
For most people's security purposes though, and especially since you're not looking to keep much money, a smartphone wallet is more than secure enough. Smartphones are generally much more secure than everyday computers, and using good security practices is trivial.
@_date: 2017-07-13 20:19:33
You send it all like a transaction or many transactions, yes. The difference is that if you do this when you're not in a rush to pay something, it doesn't really matter if it takes one hour to confirm or a day, so you can just try it when you have spare time and not worry about paying a good fee so it confirms fast. Just pay the lease amount that will still probably get processed eventually. The mempool has been getting smaller and smaller lately, it looks like the attackers have given up, so this strategy isn't even that necessary anymore anyway.

It depends on the size (in data, not in value!) of upper transaction, which itself depends on the number of inputs and outputs. Too much to explain here if you don't know what that refers to, do some research.
But fees are really a choice. You can send one with no fee at all, people still do so, but it may very well never get included in a block. Paying a proportionate fee to the size of your transaction encourages miners to include it in a block as soon as possible, so it will probably be guaranteed faster. It's relative, so if you have a transaction you want confirmed right away because it's time-sensitive, you need to worry about setting an appropriate fee. If you're just reorganizing your funds that you don't intend to spend for a long while, you can try to get away with paying nothing or almost nothing if you're ready to accept it getting stuck in the mempool for a while.

You may want to read up a lot more before putting any money into something you really don't understand.

You're investing in the wrong thing, bud. You need to get out of cryptocurrency *now* or grow up and learn about it, but you can't keep on keeping on like you are, ignorant of something while invested in it. That's a dangerous way to go.

You should never trust anyone to hold your BTC for you. Read about MtGox.

Nothing about using bitcoin or browsers that anonymize traffic is illegal in itself, or grounds for the government to spy on you.

There's nothing illegal about anyone of any age simply buying cryptocurrency assets. Some bitcoin ATMs, however, require ID verification and those may not allow a minor to use them. Not all have this feature, and I'm not sure if some that do still allow minors to purchase BTC.

If you have enough income to throw thousands of dollars into cryptocurrency but don't set up a safety net that can reasonably cover most unexpected expenses, you're a moron.

Open up the Bitcoin extension. It will prompt you to unlock your Nano S.
Connect your Nano S (it's ok if it's already connected before too). Open up the Bitcoin app. If the Chrome app still doesn't recognize it, try changing the Browser support setting in the Bitcoin app to the opposite of whatever it's set to, this for some reason usually fixes the problem right away.
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:58:38
That's not how wallets work, they can be clones of each other without any issue. However what you're describing could be a problem if the network theoretically tries to spend your transaction on the BTC chain instead of the BCC, so it's wise to move the BTC first to a different wallet you control and only after this succeeds should you try spending the BCC separately.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:54:18
Changes the mining market. The machines that dominate the industry right now are only suited for a very specific type of PoW. Changing this upsets that market, since miners would see their capital investment rendered almost useless overnight and would have to invest in new hardware again.
I can't go into a ton of detail about the mining hardware itself... I know a fair bit about the hashing that is done but not why precisely some processing units are better at what type of calculations exactly.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:55:13
It's not outright a stupid plan then, but it does seem like a lot of security theater. While it's true that by separating your funds into different platforms like this, you're keeping them safe from most vulnerabilities that only affect the others, you're still needlessly splitting funds into some platforms that are far more vulnerable than others.
What I mean, for example, is that keeping funds in a smartphone wallet is almost always going to be more secure than a desktop computer. There are just less vulnerabilities, generally speaking, for smartphone operating systems than for desktop computers. Malware and viruses are super-prevalent on the latter but not so on the former. Splitting your eggs between these two baskets doesn't make sense, they're not both equally good baskets! You're necessarily taking a much bigger risk with one than the other. Assuming you only have these two devices, you'd be far, far better off assuming your computer is infected with malware and not trusting it with any wallet and just keep using it however you want for browsing the internet and whatnot, and keeping a secure wallet on your smartphone and keeping strong computer security practices on that phone.

Well... You seem like a decently smart person, but in the future, it's generally dumb to just go with whatever random explanation you hear from strangers on the internet. Best to go right to the source as much as possible.
Bitcoin was invented by a mysterious person who used the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto. Nobody knows for sure who this person was or if they're even alive anymore. Whoever they were, they released an initial paper detailing the general scheme of the protocol, and then later some of the first software for a wallet and for mining.

No, the equivalent would be that you can pay the clerk $50 to go to the front of the line and he will count your nickels for you. The same person next to you in line, with a much easier problem that will take a second to solve, also wants to bribe the clerk to let him cut in front, but the clerk tells him it's only a $2 bribe. That's the analogy. You didn't have to pay a dime, you chose to do so, you just didn't realize it.

Fortunately it's just a function of more development to make it more accessible for newcomers, and explosive growth as a matter of time.
The internet was unforgiving and difficult for businesses and regular people to adopt at first, even though the early adopters were quickly making crazy profits. But once enough people were getting into it and the competitive edge it provided became so obvious, nobody could really afford *not* to adopt. Bitcoin will very quickly become like this.
Right now the fee market problem is stagnating growth, but the ability of the community to solve this problem even against incredible odds (multimillion dollar mining cartels backed by Chinese subsidies is no joke) relatively quickly and smoothly is a very promising indicator that development is catching up and scalability *will* be achieved until someday soon when it scales beyond the needs of the human race for the foreseeable future.

I still don't see how you figure that. Old people have historically always been prey to con men. You can trick somebody into sending cash through the mail to you if they're stupid enough.

I've got a passphrase protected Ledger Nano S, I understand all of the crypto-side tools I have at my disposal, for the most part. It's the physical security and human error half that worries me. Anywhere I might store a seed copy is vulnerable unless it's encrypted. But if my wife and/or I know a password, *we* become the vulnerability in a kidnap/arrest situation. Secret sharing scheme would mean we could design it such that they need two different passwords from each of us, but that's still very possible for the government or any clever attacker to do.
And there's no good time-lock encryption method developed as if yet.

The price of bitcoin in any other currency is literally the least important quality of bitcoin. If you lose or damage its other qualities, you'll ultimately lose that monetary value anyway. You're thinking very shortsighted. You may see temporary major volatility but in the long run, if a fork results in a better currency, the value will eventually reflect that.

You have 1 BTC on both chains. The catch is that nobody knows how much either "new BTC" should be worth, and it's very likely in the event of a fork that we'll see both prices crash pretty hard for some time. Probably one of them to virtually zero and that's what will likely kill that chain when everyone tries to sell it for the other chain and for altcoins.
Or not at all. There is absolutely no reason this would necessarily have to be the case. It could become a bizarre scenario where both chains remain stable for some time, retain most or all of their current value or even surpass it, and it really does become a case of seemingly free money. There's no rule stipulating that the price has to crash on both or either chain.

You don't need KeepKey the company to stay alone in order for your KeepKey device, or any other hardware wallet, to keep working.

FYI this is pretty much exactly what Litecoin designed itself to be, and is marketed as. The "silver" to bitcoin's "gold". A very strong concept.
Personally I'm not sure it will take off anymore... the changes being rolled into the bitcoin protocol these days have the potential to remove the barriers to near-instant, dirt-cheap transactions of BTC; on or off-chain is irrelevant to the end user as long as it is convenient and reliable. It's an interesting debate and discussion but from a developer point of view, not a user one.

Regardless, what you still don't really seem to grasp is that all that would result in, even in 99% of the community stupidly went for it, is they would fork themselves into a doomed shitty altcoin with unchecked inflation that would inevitably drop to zero someday.
A minority of the hashrate could continue with another chain as desired, with the original 21 million cap, and even if it saw an initial mass decline in users, hashrate, support as being *the* "Bitcoin", and a drop in value, I would never sell. And I think any hodler who isn't mentally retarded would make the same choice. Only a hard capped coin has any hope of retaining value in the long run. Everything else might as well be fiat.

Doesn't matter where you move it as long as it's out of the address it was in at the time of the fork. This is to protect against both blockchain accidentally trying to spend the same transaction, thinking it was intended for them. Once the BTC and BCC have been separated, ie the BTC chain has recorded the funds moving after the fork, you can try doing whatever you want with the BCC with no worry at all that it will do anything to your BTC.
Yes... not seed, private key. You can use the seed but I would only do that if you completely sweep the BTC out of that Electrum wallet first.

Both will probably be equally convinced they are the only correct position, and their opponent is a con man trying to make money from bringing down bitcoin.
Reality doesn't usually work that way. Both sides have profiteers as well as altruistic men who are genuinely trying to guide bitcoin down what they see as its best possible path. It's not about good or bad, it isn't that simple.

You don't have private keys from a Coinbase wallet. That's the whole point. It's not a wallet you control. Even if Coinbase did give you the private keys to the wallet it would be incredibly stupid to use them, since they've already been held by a third party and passed openly over the internet and exposed to your possibly compromised computer.
I personally would recommend against using Blockchain. Mycelium is a very recommendable app for Android or iOS, and since I'm assuming you have one of the two, mobile platforms are generally more secure from malware than desktop operating systems. There's also Breadwallet for iOS.

The problem with altcoins is long term trends are absolutely unpredictable, whereas these days pretty much everyone who would buy cryptocurrency agrees that bitcoin is probably the safest bet in holding value over the long term. Virtually every other cryptocurrency has crashed to zero. So nobody wants to be caught holding an alt for very long, but many people feel much safer holding BTC after they've swapped back and fort and made their profits. It's quicker than trying to take your profits back into fiat with its massive delays, huge risk of accounts being frozen and funds inaccessible, and of course paying taxes on your gains.

It doesn't really work that way. You *can* do so, but your odds of finding the correct solution for the next block are incredibly small. There's no reason to just put your own transactions in.

A good quick back of the hand estimate is 2k. Bitcoin only recently broke that record, then kept spiking up steadily until it hit the 3k wall, and is currently in a bit of a dip again. If you buy in at 2k, you'll be in huge company, I guarantee it.

Even if they want to, it's not that simple. Most people who don't have a good understanding of technology think there's some kind of magical box somewhere with a switch, and if you hit that, it'll kill the Internet. It's not even remotely like that, you can't just kill a distributed network. It would literally be a matter of one by one systematically hunting down and forcibly shutting down nodes, and even if you tried, the network would resist. It's unlikely that they would be able to succeed. Strike one node down, ten more pop up in defiance, using better techniques to mask their IPs. Hell, people would even be able to broadcast transactions over ham radio if they have to! It's been done before, if you can believe it. I know it sounds insane, but the internet could survive a nuclear war (it was actually designed for this purpose originally), just in a very degraded fashion (ie most sites would be down and almost nobody would be on it).

Short answer, high fees are a temporary recent abnormality that should go away very soon.
Longer answer... Assuming you're sending from a wallet of your own and not a third party service, you don't actually have to pay anything. Fees are voluntary, you just didn't realize this and were careless. Read up on how fees work a bit, and play around with whatever wallet you're using, see if and how you're able to set a custom fee or at least adjust it some.
Also, The price of fees has absolutely nothing to do with the value of the transfer. They're calculated based on the data size of the transaction, which itself is based on inputs and outputs. That is, if the bitcoin you're sending in your wallet is stored in a large number of addresses, probably because you received it over a large number of transactions, and/or if you're sending bitcoin to a large number of receiving addresses at once, the appropriate fee will be higher.
But again, fees are actually voluntary. The problem right now driving up costs is a little complicated, but the essence is that recently blocks have been pretty much full.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:05:55

The security of a paper wallet 100% depends on how you generate and store it.
You have to either understand the software enough to verify its integrity yourself, or trust the software you use to generate the paper wallet. You have to trust the computer you use to do it, or at the very least never again connect it to the internet so it has on chance to ever leak your private keys. You have to trust the printer you use to not save any information, or destroy it to make certain of it. It's very, very difficult to be certain of your security with paper wallets. There's lots of corners that people always cut because they stupidly hear "paper wallets are the most secure" without even thinking critically about why that is or isn't necessarily true.
Hardware wallets by comparison are of course more convenient to spend with, but also they're incredibly hard to fuck things up with compared to a DIY paper wallet. I don't know about initializing a Trezor, but when you start up your Ledger Nano S, you *have* to prove to the device that you wrote down your seed words; it immediately quizzes you on what the words are before you can move on and you must answer correctly. There's no easy way to screw up transactions when the receiving address is shown on the device screen itself so you can be sure an attacker isn't spoofing the address to trick you into sending it to their wallet instead. You don't have to trust a website not to pass your private keys over the internet or trust your browser or computer.

Don't drop a dime in something you don't understand. Cryptocurrency is a groundbreaking asset but you should take it slow and understand what you're getting in to. There's no close analogy to it, it's not like the stock market and it's not like gold or silver. You need some basic knowledge if you want to buy BTC and keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:19:05

You can't, really. Any kind of transaction that day will be riskier than normal if a fork happens, because the new coin you have will only be valid on one chain, and there's no way of knowing which chain will have the best future value. If you want to exploit the possible low prices that day you will necessarily be taking on lots of risk with whatever you buy at that time. There's no way around that.

Electrum is a very good wallet with lots of helpful features while still remaining simple to use, easy on beginners, and a clean interface. My issue with it though is that it's a desktop application, and I don't trust my own computer or most computers to be free of malware. Even Macs and Linux systems these days are vulnerable. I feel more comfortable with smartphone wallets because they're far less vulnerable to these kinds of threats and mine personally has built-in biometric identification that as far as I know hasn't been spoofed yet (thumbprint reader on iPhone).

2. Yes and no. It's good security practice to use new addresses for every transaction, and most wallets do this automatically, so the answer is basically yes. The file grows as you have more transactions because you're adding new addresses every time. But it doesn't necessarily have to scale that way. You can reuse addresses if you don't mind those transactions being easy to link by an observer.

You should at least vaguely understand public key cryptography to the point where you understand what a private key is, what it's used for (ie signing a tx), and the various ways it could be compromised and what this would mean (theft of your bitcoin). Someone not understanding that you don't need to spend a hundred dollars in order to keep bitcoin in a wallet you control clearly doesn't understand bitcoin enough at all to be throwing money at it.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:20:32

You're not going to "get" anything new per se. Think of the blockchain like a timeline, where all the nodes agree on a precise history of the world. A fork is like an alternative divergent universe that splits off from the other at a specific moment in time.
According to both sides of a fork, the same addresses up until the fork had the same amount of bitcoin. But now there's two chains going forward. Post-fork, the blockchain differ. And they now can be used separately as assets and traded.
You aren't "getting" Bitcoin Cash, you will already have it.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:08:48
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:15:34
Your final conclusion is more or less correct, yes. Generally there are people who make a hell of a lot of profit trading back and forth between altcoins and BTC or even ETH these days but nobody who knows what they're doing wants to hold altcoins very long, generally. Because 99.9% of them are pretty much guaranteed to crash and become worthless sooner or later but so far bitcoin has been the clear winner in terms of keeping its value.

@_date: 2017-07-19 20:46:59
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:20:45
That's what a split means. You can now "double spend", but each chain intentionally wants this. They accept you as owner of independent coins on each chain where before you only had coins on one, and so it's not technically double spending anymore because they will each recognize different transaction histories from that fork onward.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:32:07

@_date: 2017-07-03 20:13:34
No, you still have it wrong.
For somebody to send you bitcoin they need your public address. You don't need to do anything at all to "receive" bitcoin, it's already sent to that address regardless. What you need the private key for is to spend the bitcoin held in that public address.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:19:25


Well that first of all is your problem right there. Your whole train of logic already is wrong starting at your fundamental premise. That's not how Bitcoin works. There are no "curators". Many different groups develop software and proposals for changes to the bitcoin protocol. Users as a community either implement them, or don't. Nobody can make the community do anything. Nobody is "the" developer group of Bitcoin.
Study up on what forks are, the different types of forks, and how they generally work. The short answer to your question is that in order to "change" bitcoin in this way, you cannot just hope to put out a software change, expect the entire community to adopt it just because you want them to, and have it be the new bitcoin protocol. In reality any even moderately successful attempt to change the 21 million cap would require, and result in, a hard fork, splitting BTC into one coin with the 21 million limit, and one without. And practically speaking, given that an inflationary cryptocurrency is a hilarious mockery of bitcoin that would rapidly become a worthless plaything at the mercy of miner-developer cartels pumping and dumping the value down to nothing and nobody would willingly buy such a useless coin for long term value, only the 21 million limit bitcoin would ever remain relevant.

As long as the wallet shows you the deterministic seed it uses to generate your addresses, literally any wallet is better than leaving it on an exchange where you have zero control of your bitcoin.
That being said, familiarize yourself with the popular wallet software that's out there and get to know the advantages and disadvantages of each. Electrum, for example, is a decent wallet for beginners, with a simple enough interface to not be too intimidating for someone still learning, but still allows things like setting your own custom fee which is useful once you sort of do know what you're doing.

There's no "better", it depends what you're looking for. Electrum is a lightweight wallet that works without running its own local copy of the blockchain, so it's very very fast and doesn't need crazy memory or bandwidth requirements. Core is more or less the full bitcoin experience.
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:38:49
Unless you can find the seed, it's gone. Any possible way that you could get your funds back otherwise would be a very very bad thing for other users because it means that a thief could easily get access to your wallet without your phone password, they'd just have to reset your phone and then do whatever steps you'd follow to somehow restore without the seed.
You should learn to take better care of sensitive documents. It's an expensive lesson to learn but that's the way it is, sadly.

Even then it's almost for certain far too late. At most they could probably sustain a very short-lived 51% attack of days, *maybe* weeks at most. Less than a majority of the hashrate, they could maybe continue attacking in various ways to degrade the network for a longer period of time.
And as others have mentioned, there's no reason to think the community wouldn't react. Just look at the situation with the major BIPs right now! That's all just in response to some relatively minor disruption with possible spam attacks on the mempool. Really minor stuff compared to an attempted 51% hijacking.

You need to study up on public key cryptography so you understand what wallets are. Until you do that you will forever remain completely confused about what is secure or unsecure when it comes to cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:29:49
It's not the only one by far, there are tons of ways to buy and sell BTC. But it is an option. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:00:08
Look into hot wallets like Electrum, Mycelium, Copay, Breadwallet, Armory, GreenBits, et cetera.

@_date: 2017-07-23 19:12:22
As long as you move them to a wallet you and only you control, you can always do whatever you want in the future with any side of a fork. But if you're moving them into a third party custodial wallet like Coinbase, you're at the mercy of their arbitrary choices.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:58:46
Yes and no. The wallet you choose might not immediately enable you to do that or even ever do so. But you'll be able to import your seed into another wallet that does and you could try it that way. But it is risky for various reasons.

This is idiotic. Use a passphrase and commit it to memory. A random grid pattern is far, far worse for memorization than any password could ever be, if it's sufficiently random. If it's not random at all, if it's a highly regular pattern that's easy to memorize, then it's not secure at all and could be cracked in minutes.

Yes, or into any other compatible wallet.
The seed words are used deterministically to generate all the key pairs you use with that wallet. Read about public key cryptography if you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Understand that if you lose access to the wallet from a glitch or your phone being lost or whatever, and you don't have those words, there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to help you. You've burned your money. And that should seem a little scary to you. But think of the security implications of that for someone trying to rob you. It's damn near impossible.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:47:59

@_date: 2017-07-15 02:26:34
Blockchain is not a better wallet than Breadwallet. Both give you the seed to your private keys but by using Blockchain, a third party website also gets that seed, even if supposedly they have good security practices. You're relying on Blockchain not getting hacked. With Breadwallet you only need to concern yourself with your own device being hacked, which is way way way waaaaaaay less likely if you even just use a PIN code.
Coinbase, you've got the right idea, yeah. It's even more accurate to say that you don't own cryptocurrency at all if it's on coinbase; you own IOUs.
You should read up more on how transaction fees work, it's difficult to concisely explain it here.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:28:44
It looks pretty legitimate, but this is the first I've heard of them. The products they sell are widely used and very popular among bitcoin enthusiasts, so definitely I can tell you those products are not a scam. Whether the seller is legitimate or not, I couldn't say for sure.

It's not "possible", it's easily verifiable and completely obvious that you would have made more profit just buying bitcoin. Just look at the average price from January until now.

People leave BTC in exchanges because they're retarded monkeys with neither the hindsight to look back at incidents like MtGox nor the foresight to adequately measure the enormous risk of trusting random internet strangers with their money against the convenience of being able to trade without first moving in and out of wallets.
Just look at the past history and decide for yourself, but you've already seem to come to the correct conclusion.
FYI around here we usually tell people who ask this question that they don't have any bitcoins, they have IOUs.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:00:37
It's possible that some exchanges could go down in flames with the price volatility that a fork may bring. It's already been a pattern that they have outages lasting a day or longer when the price moves even moderately steeply. I wouldn't be surprised to see a long term shutdown if we see &gt;$2k again soon.

I believe so. Not all wallets even with the same number of words use the same exact algorithm to service private keys from the seed, but Electrum and Blockchain should be compatible. Look in Electrum's documentation to check.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:16:11
You'll probably want to go with something like Electrum. Moderately easy for beginners (like myself as well) to play around with, and it lets you set custom fees as well so you can avoid paying miner fees that are too high.
If you plan on having large amounts of cryptocurrency, invest in a hardware wallet. There's no beating that peace of mind.

Blockchain is an online wallet where your private keys are stored on a centralized server that belongs to and is controlled by Blockchain. Not you.

Only use wallets that store your information locally on your device.
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:37:59
Please do your due diligence before investing in a volatile asset. Read about Mt. Gox.
If you don't have bitcoin in a wallet you control, in which you and only you have access to the private keys, you don't have any bitcoin. Coinbase does. You have an IOU from bitcoin promising to deliver bitcoin at some future time when you try to withdraw it to your own wallet.

Mt. Gox also infamously claimed that they had a majority of their bitcoin in cold storage right up until the day of the great crash.
Logically speaking I would never trust this to be actually the case without any proof of it. It's just not in their economic interest to keep the bulk of their BTC behind barriers. They want as much liquidity as possible, and that necessitates vulnerabilities.

I'm not specifically sure about the Blockchain wallet as I've never used it. It may be possible to get your key information from it. But this would be highly inadvisable, as doing so completely defeats the purpose of moving from a web wallet to a more secure keys-offline kind of wallet, since your keys will have already been exposed to the internet in some fashion and been held by a third party who you will have to trust indefinitely not to compromise your funds. It's better to send what you get as a payment to your copay wallet.
You don't want to bother with mining on Nicehash, you're not going to make more money mining than you're losing with electricity costs and hardware degradation.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:04:07
I don't trust banks or another third party storage.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:18:48
Obviously hindsight is 20/20, this happened to you in the pre-Gox days and most people were stupidly naive and not worried about a Gox-like incident, and also like you said, it's not like you even kept your coin then long-term.
But I guess this is why going forward in the future, people should always try to split their sell-off across multiple exchanges in small amounts they can afford to lose. Better to miss out on a bit of profit from day-to-day volatility than miss out on the entire payout.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:15:22

That's absolutely a factor and none of what I said is any reason to go and claim that bitcoin is invincible or something. It's not. No currency ever is. But it does have many very good reasons giving it a lot of staying power. A vast number of merchants already use bitcoin but not altcoins, or if they do, most of their transactions are bitcoin anyway. Exchanges thrive on bitcoin transactions. And so on.
If bitcoin crashes and stays low, it will tear down a lot of that infrastructure with it when exchanges go bust, merchants can't sell goods and services and buyers can't buy because nobody knows what crypto to use, exchange rates are more volatile than ever because speculation is driving the prices of every altcoin like crazy trying to set themselves up as the successor coin, et cetera...

Making any major purchase at that time is going to be very risky. But at the same time I expect huge profits to be made.

There is. You definitely are on the right track and you understand as much as most people who are regular long time users of these kinds of wallet already. Keep going further and reading into it, it's interesting stuff. Some wallets use 24 words. They don't always have to be English. Some have protocols for using a user-generated password as one of the seed words to throw more entropy into the mix and make it tough to steal, so long as the user can be trusted not to forget the password.

And then they just stupidly assume gold has intrinsic value without exploring that bizarre assumption in the least. Whereas if they actually bothered to try to defend that assertion at all, they would realize most of the qualities they're proclaiming in favor of gold are shared by bitcoin.

Yes, I'll be fine most likely. I would hodl very hard unless I had to go some time without a job and eating through fiat savings too fast. But as it is right now I have way higher job security than most Americans, a much easier time getting desirable jobs, and a better combination of pay and benefits than most. I'm very fortunate right now and I'm not worried about another recession that much.
That being said, I think cryptocurrencies have a very serious chance of going right for the moon in such a situation if it starts to get really serious. People fearing for their retirement and life savings will flock to what they've seen hold value. Lots of new buyers will turn to bitcoin in that situation out of desperation. This time it's fiat that would be going FUD. Not to mention the utility value of bitcoin in a recession in supporting the grey and black market. If it starts to spiral into an actual depression, I wouldn't doubt the chance that bitcoin ends up stronger for it.

But that's the thing about distributed networks, the larger they grow, the more impossible they become to take down in an attack. Every node is one more that must be brought offline in order to stop the bitcoin blockchain from progressing. Even a few nodes left online will keep the currency alive.
And there's no single piece of software they all run that can be compromised to infect the whole network. People run all kinds of different clients, use different wallets with all sorts of security measures.
It's not as easy as saying "terrorism". It's very possible that the bitcoin network has already passed the point where even the most powerful governments in the world working together in a concerted effort to shut down bitcoin might not succeed. If it hasn't reached that point, it may very well do so soon.

You need to read up more on how fees work. It depends on the wallet you are using (how to set them, not how much they should be).
Fees are not based at all on the amount of the transaction (0.00001 BTC is indistinguishable for this purpose from 1,000,000 BTC), but instead on the complexity of the transaction in terms of inputs and outputs. The gist of this is that inputs are all the different addresses and amounts you received bitcoin *from*, going *into* addresses you're trying to spend from. And outputs are the same, going *out* of your addresses elsewhere. So getting lots of small amounts of payment into an address and then trying to spend it all as one amount will be a fairly costly transaction.

Well, it's an issue unless you get widespread BTC adoption in the general population in other economic activity first. If everyday people start speculating in the currency, using it for money transfer to friends and family, for grey market hustles, et cetera. 
For people who have already adopted bitcoin, the issue is backwards. Have bitcoin, want coffee, but buying directly with BTC may be slow and pricey at the moment. What's the fastest and cheapest way to go through USD for a cheap buy? And there are various solutions out there for that already.

Think of bitcoin like a safe. The safe itself is essentially impenetrable, but if you keep it on your porch without any protection it is likely to be stolen. That is not a vulnerability inherent to the safe, it is a flaw in your protection of your valuable assets.

If you can afford to speculate on crypto, you can afford to stash and protect the keys somewhere safer than under your mattress.
Ideally, a twelve word seed should be easy enough to memorize anyway, right?

So most people shouldn't need to keep a written seed somewhere readily accessible.

"coins" aren't stored anywhere. You keep private keys in order to sign transactions that allow you to spend bitcoins that have been received by your public addresses.

Some wallets don't let you set your own fee (ie set it to zero if you'd like), but almost all of them have some degree of choice in how low or high you want to pay. In choosing a good wallet it is highly recommended once you understand the bitcoin network a bit, to try to get a wallet that lets you set custom fees.
But 1000% I guarantee you, before you hit "send", it told you how much the fee was.

The "majority of the world" has already paid one hell of an opportunity cost by not jumping on the bitcoin train, and will continue to do so until bitcoin either takes the stage as the global store of value, or crashes and falls to basically zero.

bitaddress.org or other similar sites generates private-public key pairs for you through a variety of different methods. The problem, however, is that even though the site may be trustworthy, your computer may be infected with malware that will record what you do and will send your keys to an attacker. Even the printer you use for a paper wallet could save your file and then release it to a hacker.
Be forewarned. Best practice is to save the website, transfer it somehow to a purely offline device, use it to create your keys, and print them with a printer that will never connect to the internet or remember what it has printed.

It's thousands of times more mainstream than any other crypto though, both in public fame and notoriety, exchange and wallet application and other supporting infrastructure, general familiarity, and in terms of being as "proven" of a currency as any other crypto can hope to be as of yet.
People for ages mocked and doubted bitcoin. Many still do, of course. But overall people across the world have slowly come to see that despite its price volatility it has made a lot of early adopters very rich very quickly, has had tangible benefits as a store of value against hyperinflation already in countries like Venezuela, is easy for everyday merchants and buyers to adopt (ignoring for now the current transaction cost problems that are a genuine obstacle), and has been successfully used now by millions of people for years.
No altcoin has anywhere near that kind of general public awareness. And that is an extremely valuable asset in bitcoin's favor. You'd be a fool to underestimate it.

You're misunderstanding the problem though. If the address you're "confirming" got swapped into your clipboard and you're copypasting it into your wallet software while using a hardware wallet, all you will do when you confirm the tx on the hardware side is see "oh yeah, same address I'm looking at here on the screen, check", when it's the spoof address.

If BTC ever makes it that mainstream for it to be a genuine issue, we will have ubiquitous anonimization. I can't foresee any other way it will survive that long, grow its market share enough for everyday coffee purchases to be a normal fact of life, and yet still allow people to comfortably hold 90+BTC without sweating every small purchase being linked to their jackpot.

Better question, why would you want your bitcoin in somebody else's wallet instead of yours?

You need to read about how public key cryptography works.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:38:08
Well, there's really no difference in copy-pasting and double checking that the address is the same versus typing it by hand, but sure. Always confirm the address is the intended one.
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:46:03
If you look at chicken feces at just the right angle...
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:35:37
Plenty of us are on this train until it hits the moon. I think if the day ever comes when the market price of BTC&lt;-&gt;USD is something like a million dollars per bitcoin, it's as much a bad sign for fiat as it is a good sign of bitcoin's health. There's no way I'd trust fiat at that point anymore, if it has fallen so far in relative value to cryptocurrency. At that point the market cap for bitcoin would surely be astronomical. There's really no benefit to switching back at that point to an inferior currency.
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:48:46
It's still valid. Most wallets change the receive address for every new transaction for security purposes. Makes it more difficult to track transactions, improving anonymity of individuals and the network as a whole.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:56:13
Generally not.

I'm willing to bet I know a hell of a lot more about how far along these technologies are, what their potential capabilities are, and what methods would be quantum resistant and quantum-proof than you are. So, yes, I think I am *somewhat* aware of the upcoming quantum hurdle. I also know a little bit about proposals as to how bitcoin can be made ready for when that day comes.


Sure, it's definitely possible that the government made it.


That's not how computing works. Individual to individual, three letter federal agencies have more computing power than any other *one* player, yes. They have the biggest gun, so to speak. But *altogether* that's nowhere close to true. They absolutely do not have enough computing power to beat out tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and someday maybe millions of nodes running a distributed network across the entire globe.


lol ok buddy. I'm not sure what you even think the government would *do* if somehow it could "control" bitcoin. What exactly would that even mean to you? How do they "control" it?
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:58:41
I want to help you out, but holding your hand and telling you what wallet to use would defeat the purpose because you won't understand *why* you should choose one wallet over another and why one is more secure, or more convenient, et cetera.

$4 fee is not unheard of right now to pay during high traffic for a fast transaction, sadly. That being said, you can definitely pay way less and still usually be fine.

False sense of security breeds complacency. Oh, I've been using X wallet so far with no problems at X amount of BTC. Must be safe to keep doing so.
A healthy understanding of the ecosystem you're dealing with and the many potential dangers there are within it is critical here.
@_date: 2017-06-27 10:35:53
Somebody claims to have just started to mine bitcoin but doesn't even understand what wallets are or why using Coinbase for a wallet is a terrible idea seems like a good recipe for losing lots of money.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:16:33
Do your research and find a wallet which only stores your private keys on your own device.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:43:17
You were hit with two problems, really. First of all it is absolutely pointless and uneconomic to buy that small an amount from an exchange. The fee just to buy is way too high.
Secondly, Coinbase won't let you control how much you pay for the fee to withdraw to your own wallet, so that really sucks. If they did, then you could have paid as low a fee as you wanted and just waited it out.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:36:23


A few points here... Not all ATMs require any kind of ID, so from that point you'd be fine there.
However, even that wouldn't necessarily be foolproof if you don't do any sort of tumbling to anonymize your bitcoin. Say you just buy all your btc on a single exchange over a period of time. Maybe you even make it really easy and send it all to the same address in your own wallet. Cool. Then you go to this ATM and withdraw from that same wallet address for cash. Extremely traceable for anybody watching the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:34:00
It depends on the fee paid and also just how long that particular block takes. Coinbase transfers for me are usually faster than 30 minutes. You can check the status of the transaction in a blockchain explorer.
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:21:28
Definitely real it up into smaller pieces. Good news is you will be able to sell at higher than exchange rates.

Do some research about the state of bitcoin mining these days. It's not a small unknown hobby anymore, it's a massive and highly specialized, brutally competitive market now. You're guaranteed to lose money unless you're well-connected and well-funded in that game now.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:31:51


It's not about storage space, it's about keeping the keys airgapped but still being able to sign transactions with great convenience.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:52:41
There's no way of knowing this. They could still remain compatible forever even with no future development.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:03:08
If you buy btc on an exchange but don't move it to your own wallet, you have no good reason to believe it actually exists anywhere and you could get fucked if you try to withdraw it at a later time.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:52:22
It's a good strategy but that has nothing to do with holding or selling.
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:14:02
Well, if the line isn't constantly being filled with more people buying their way into the front of the line faster than you are making your way to the front for free.
It is possible that the network could remain so congested indefinitely that no one could ever get included in a block at zero fee, but let's hope this doesn't remain plausible forever.

What exactly is a keycard?
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:24:06
Yes. The price will go to $2,947 in three days time, then break 3k again and briefly hit $3,100.
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:32:02
Your bitcoins will be valid and recognized on both chains, assuming the split happens and remains relevant for any significant period of time. You now own bitcoin-1 and bitcoin-2, so to speak. There will be a lot of confusion at this time. Making any serious transactions is probably unwise. Price will be quite volatile. Nobody will know what they want to trade for during this time, as everyone will want to see what the market as a whole decides first so they know which coin has "real" value and which will be the new altcoin, pretty much.
Hodling is basically not an issue at all here. Just keep hodling. You have nothing to consider, you have done your diligence.

You need to do lots of research, my friend. I only own a little ETH so I'm not the best to ask, but yes, it works the same as far as no fee to receive a transaction.
You need to understand what the fees *are* and how they work, though.
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:33:58
You will not make money mining bitcoin, you will lose much more money than you could possibly make by trying to do so.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:48:39
Correct, as long as you can use that seed on another wallet you don't even have to rely on that particular wallet software.

Christ, you're a moron.
I have $X right now. I can choose between having $X *more*, or X BTC. I choose X BTC.
That is in no way at odds with me already having $X. Just because I already have $X does not mean I also want to have $X *more*. It just means that I prefer having *at least* $X rather than X BTC. These are not at all the same choices.
For example, let's say I have 10k of savings in fiat in a bank account. Because I have chosen to stash this amount in a bank account, does it logically follow that I would choose to take another 10k into my savings account versus 10k worth of any other asset? No, it doesn't. I may not want another penny at all. Perhaps 10k is the most I would want readily available as an emergency fund. Perhaps I am already over what I would like to have in stagnant fiat. Or perhaps I would gladly take another 10k sitting in my account. Who knows. The point is, you can't just assume "well this person chose to have 10k previously, they must prefer to have another 10k more than any other possible asset". That's asinine.

A wallet has nothing to do with buying or selling bitcoin. Research what the hell you're talking about. Investing in something you don't understand is a very bad idea.
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:47:10
It doesn't matter. Coinbase will come and go. Exchanges are not guaranteed any staying power. Hacks of major exchanges are a commonplace feature of life now. You can cry all you want about your favorite exchange getting hacked but at the end of the day, you can spend months appealing to some strangers who ultimately don't care about your security and just want to profit off currency speculation, or you could do yourself a favor and actually take your security into your own hands.
@_date: 2017-07-09 04:11:43
It has nothing to do with how much in bitcoin you transferred, so that's impossible to answer without more information.

It's not worth it at all. You're spending way too much time for very small fractions of pennies. You'll make more money walking the streets and picking up change, using one of those machines to get bills from coins, and using a BTM or buying for cash on localbitcoins or something.

You *want* investment as this stage of the game. It needs lots of committed investors to become viable as a currency. Right now while the market for bitcoin is already impressive given how young it is, it is still very small compared to buying with the dollar. But once you have huge numbers of people holding bitcoin as an investment merchants have a stronger incentive to accept it as payment, employers will want to pay it, and someday prices and even wages would become sticky.
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:15:44
Presumably a significant amount of bitcoin usage in India would be receiving remittances from relatives abroad, and a mid-term store of wealth to guard against fiat volatility. The average person should not have a huge concern with making regular transactions in amounts small enough to feel the pain of tx costs.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:46:36
Still not a good idea to treat your bitcoin like USD. There's no real advantage to leaving it in a third party's wallet, and every possible disadvantage of doing so.

No, but I highly recommend you do a lot more research on understanding *why* that is and how hardware wallets operate compared to using an online wallet, a hot wallet, or some form of cold storage.

Stashing a hardware wallet is not an issue at all for most people. If you masked regular transactions with it and don't have your life savings on it or anything like that, it's not a terrible idea to keep it somewhere convenient in your home. Stealing the device itself doesn't grant the thief the ability to steal your bitcoin, and you can recover them as long as you keep a copy of the seed.
Where to actually stash a private key in the form of a paper wallet or any other encoding is another problem entirely. Personally I'd bury a backup or two somewhere if you have any wilderness accessible from where you live. Better if these copies are encrypted with a password that only you know so anybody who does miraculously find them still can't spend anything. Keep another in a safe deposit box, also encrypted. Send encrypted copies to trusted friends/family in whatever secure method you trust, or split up the key with a secret sharing scheme and distribute them appropriately.
