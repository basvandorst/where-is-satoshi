As much as I'm a supporter of cryptocurrency, your fallacy is cherry picking.

Nice unsupported assertion there, would be a shame if someone were to tell you it's wrong
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:56:45
Probably because China has large bitcoin mining industry as well as massive electronic theft/fraud industry. China knows it's making too much money off crypto to ever consider banning it

The encryption protects you from the email company and cloud provider. Do you not understand what encryption is?
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:32:18
 Literally encrypt your files you absolute peasant. 
You'd think CRYPTOcurrency would give you a clue
@_date: 2018-11-09 02:44:41
 Literally encrypt a txt file with your pertinent info, goober.
Set up a sock gmail through a private VPN.
Email it to yourself. 
Nobody other than you can open it, or has any record of your ownership of it.  
Source: actually have computer, networking, and security certs.

Part time work, some sort of Craigslist or eBay business, day trading crypto, freelance computer work, some multilevel marketing, SOMETHING. Your financial options are only limited by your imagination and your willingness to put in the work.

The only people who should celebrate the stagnation of its value are those looking to buy more. Both owners and users of bitcoin lose purchasing power when the value growth slows or reverses

 Haha you fucking fool. Legal brothel girls are cleaner than your average girl next door. They're tested very frequently and cannot work if they test positive.

At this current point the only reason you should sell is because you don't see it recovering past its current price any time soon.
