I suppose it's not entirely impossible that they both could have worked together to create bitcoin. Though with Kleiman being the public face and posting under Satoshi in the forums. I highly doubt all that correspondence was Wright himself - as you said, it doesn't really fit.

I guess it'd have to be reaching 15 million bitcoins on Christmas!

Heh novelty ID ;)
Don't send straight from coinbase, they will close your account if your behavior seems fishy (I've had it happen myself.. not that I did anything super sketchy though). Transfer to a wallet first, breadwallet or electrum etc
You don't really *need* to use a mixer, but it's great for extra privacy and would throw coinbase off your tracks if they do try to follow your transaction trail.
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:05:18
If you do this though, buy a little extra as I'm pretty sure they now have a 1% withdrawal fee.
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:04:51
Here, have some on me to get you started! 630 bits
As others have said, buy from trusted websites and sellers. It's quite easy to do these days. Just try to avoid keeping your bitcoin stored with an exchange or third party though. Airbitz and breadwallet are pretty safe wallets and very straight forward to use. If you ever get your hands on a substantial amount of coin, it is worthwhile to invest in a Trezor or similar for extra security.

Probably because most women aren't into computer science/technology in the first place. 
As said:


Same thing happened to me. I was the only female in a class of 30. It's still pretty much a male-dominated area. So it makes sense that the majority of Bitcoin users are indeed male. Women simply haven't heard much about it. And if they have, are still less likely to participate because of the risks involved and/or don't see the point. 
That being said though I do hope more women get involved. - it will drive more incentive for merchants to accept Bitcoin, as we love online shopping. ;)
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:45:07
Sweeping is moving all of the coins from one address to another. You need to scan or import the QR code (private key) to your wallet in order to do this. This particular one is formatted so that you can only use a specific wallet to get the funds. That so happens to be Airbitz! 
Someone has already claimed the funds - I am usually on the lookout for these posts but always end up too late!
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:11:44
Get a hardware Trezor wallet. I know you don't want an offline wallet but these things are great. Unlike an offline paper wallet, you can't fuck up and lose the change address with your coins. You can also access them instantly by plugging it in and recover from a seed if you ever lose the device. If you want to know more you should search this sub and the Internet for people's opinions on the Trezor. 
But if you're really insistent on an online wallet, airbitz is pretty cool. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:56:39
You should invest in a trezor

I don't mind it - makes people think for themselves and form individual opinions, rather than just agreeing with the most popular comment.
Though it still does really bug me somehow. I'm so used to seeing the number there that it makes me feel uneasy. People don't like the unfamiliar. 
Personally, I think hiding the votes for an hour or two rather than a full 24 hours  would be a better choice. That and making sure the posts still get sorted like the rest of reddit.

@_date: 2016-01-30 08:45:23
No problem! 
And just so you know, If you ever do end up buying Bitcoin to keep, it is a bad idea to leave those coins stored where you bought them. As exchanges and websites can be shut down or hacked, therefore  compromising your coins. Instead, transfer to a more secure wallet such as electrum, mycellium, bread wallet, airbitz etc

Hey I had never done it before so thought why not. Paid for it in Bitcoin so it still counts right?
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:24:44
Most places you buy bitcoin from actually need you to sign up in order to make a purchase. (As your ID needs to be verified)
They will store the coins you purchased in a wallet on their website. You can then just withdraw these straight to any Bitcoin address you want. It's a fairly simple process. 
Examples: localbitcoins, circle, coinbase + many others
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:05:03
Yes you can send or add funds to a paper wallet as often as you like without having to make a new one. You only have to create a new one when you send or spend any balance from said wallet. So if you are transferring between them and dont want to make new ones, just make sure you send the complete balance over to the second wallet.
[This explanation]( might help you better understand
I suggest just making a bunch of paper wallets with different denominations, such as $5, $10, $15 etc and treat them sort of like cash.  :)
@_date: 2016-01-31 21:55:15
There's no point replying to them as the accounts get banned pretty quickly. Plus the guy himself actually commented on a thread a while back saying that he was using a bot and doesn't bother looking at any replies.

As a person that already plays ingress, this sounds amazing! can't wait to test it out once dropping is live. I'll be able to hit up portals and collect Bitcoin on the go ;)
It is probably impossible to stop spoofers completely though - but it seems like you have put in place some pretty good barriers so far. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:28:24
No, you'll have to monitor what address the change is sent to and then make that one into a new paper wallet. You'll be able to see which addresses you own on the software/client you've used to generate your first address.
This whole process can be quite confusing. That's why I usually just tell newcomers to use a simple online wallet.
Using some clients you can enable the change to be sent back to the original address - and therefore you wouldnt have to print out a new wallet - but this compromises your privacy quite a lot. It is still an option though.
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:58:56
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:37:32
If you want to buy with cash, best way would be Localbitcoins.com - Look for someone well known with good feedback. It's a fairly simple process and the website holds funds in escrow so that it's hard to get ripped off.
Send the funds you receive on localbitcoins to a wallet such as airbitz, breadwallet or electrum. There are many more but those are my recommendations.
If you aren't planning on spending the coin - and keeping it instead, you could create paper wallets for offline storage. There are tutorials everywhere. Just remember that if you do spend from a paper wallet, you'll need to create a new one as the change is sent to a new address.

@_date: 2016-01-18 09:49:51
Yes that's right. If done correctly, the benefit of a paper wallet is that the keys are not stored digitally. Which pretty much removes the risk of your coin being stolen via malware or other means.
An alternative just-as-safe option to this is a hardware wallet such as trezor, from which you can spend and not have to worry about where the change gets sent to - as it is all contained within the device.
And though the wallets I suggested to you are generally safe, there is still a vulnerability there with any online wallet.

Is there a reason you can't or don't want to verify your paypal? 
I'm very doubtful that you'll be able to find a way to exchange your funds without the verification. So if you can verify, do it - as it's the only direct way. Worse case, you'll have to buy gift cards and then sell those for bitcoins.

There is actually quite a large thread on Bitcointalk, and a user specifically talks about how he lost 5 BTC
They have traced that approximately 21 BTC was scammed by bitcoinblackfriday.info - this number could be higher as well. I think the website was taken down before thorough research on all the phishing sites could be done. 
A number of people reported the websites to google as malicious, so that's why browsers eventually gave people a heads up. Others also contacted the websites hosting and the merchants etc. Main site was probably taken down by the host - or the website creators themselves once people caught on. 
Here's the bitcointalk thread I mentioned 
@_date: 2015-11-28 04:15:17
That's because the .info website was considered competition at the time. Bitcoin Black Friday (.com!) has been a running event for years. Nobody could have known that the deals on the competing website would be scams - until it actually went live. Before today, both sites were landing pages and waited to release their deals until the day of the event.
Though this .info website was sketchy in my eyes (and others) from the start, everything appeared to be legitimate on the surface. It honestly surprised me that they would go this far. And I'm glad that it didn't go unnoticed for long.
Safe to say that people should only trust the original website from now on. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:57:47
Yes. The phishing sites were most likely created by the main site itself. Certainly seems to be what is speculated at the moment. 
The merchants no doubt signed themselves up to be featured on the bitcoinblackfriday.info website. As most of them are also featured on bitcoinblackfriday.com! (with the real deals though)
This is not a case of scammers simply submitting their fake sites to .info, pretending to be the merchants. It has to be .info itself cloning the deals that were submitted to them beforehand and discounting even heavier to attract targets.
*They also could have stolen and cloned said deals right from the .com site (since it launched first!)
Quite clever and carefully planned if you ask me. No wonder they put so much time in advertising and manipulating reddit votes.
