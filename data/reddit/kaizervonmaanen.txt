Some poor old person will probably use her savings on this to be able to leave their grandchildren with a good inheritance because they heard about bitcoin in the news and know nothing about how it works.

The old true and tested method. Everything else is a scam.

Yeah, haha... Old and senile people deserve to feel dread and regret for the rest of their lives because they were swindled out of their life savings. They just get what they deserve, stupid old people who don't know how bitcoin works. Haha, they got it coming

I call it distributed computing. It's a nice observation I guess, but it is not really different from using a regular computer with a block chain, just that there is a bigger distance between the different parts of the computer that is used.

It's a interesting observation. A paradox is a logical contradiction, something that logically can't be true for example if I fail and pass an exam at the same time it is a paradox and in real life only one of them is true, because both can't be true at the same time because it is a paradox. Your observation can be true even if both your statements are true. A paradox is logically false and untrue if everything in the paradox is true. 
If they ought to have a node or not is not for me to answer. If they manage to mine without it somehow then they obviously don't need it.

They still sell them as souvenirs in the border regions. For example in Zambia and so on, I am pretty sure you can get one as a souvenir if you travel to Zimbabwe

The good old 'buy high, sell low' strategy... He should do the opposite instead

To be honest, I sold my bitcoin and has gone to other cryptos. It will continue to grow, likely... But I don't have any now anymore

Etherium and going to get some Monero. Don't want to say how much.

That is not a paradox
