Isint that what bitcoin cash does by having larger block sizes?  What makes Segwit different?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:20:38
Bitcoin was fast and cheap before everybody started using it and the blockchain was not clogged. I fail to understand how Segwit prevents the blockchain from cloging.

I want classmates to look back on what I said when bitcoin is worth 1,000,000$ and have them think I was ahead of my time 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:09:15
So does that mean if I repeatedly search bitcoin on Google, the price will go up? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:28:57
That's pretty good

I'm 16 too and I have put 1000$ of my job money into crypto, now have 1800. We shud hang out sometime lol.

Yeah that sounds Good, I'll definitely include those three things. 
 I'm not so great at my school work and I have failed many classes, if bitcoin pulls through the quote will be a statement to all of the teachers/classmates that think I wont ammount to anything. Also it will proove to my grandkids that you don't have to have other pepole think your smart to be succesful.
