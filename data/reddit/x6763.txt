You can start a new branch at any point in the chain, but unless you have enough computing power to build that branch with a *higher total difficulty* than the main branch, it will effectively be ignored by the rest of the network.

from   this morning:
    07:59 &lt; TD&gt; no, it's fine. this is an 'official' google project.
    07:59 &lt; doublec_&gt; ok, cool
    07:59 &lt; TD&gt; it's just not a big team with big strategic implications or anything
    07:59 &lt; TD&gt; at least ..... not yet &gt;:-)

The test network uses a different genesis block than the main network (there are also a couple differences such as the port number, difficulty rules, different wallet, etc).  Nodes will not have any problems between the main network and the test network.
gigtrix covered the part about creating a competing network.
I'll also add that the client has the main network genesis block (as well as the test network genesis block) hard coded into it, as well as the block id's of certain "checkpoints", so it's only possible for a client to get fooled into using a more recent branch off the main chain.  Having a single connection to a node with the correct block chain is enough to counter any attacks attempting to feed you a weaker branch, as your node will be able to calculate the total difficulty of each branch and therefore know which one it is suppose to use.
