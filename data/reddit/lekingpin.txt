Provide very cheap energy, wait till all large scale mining moved, then confiscate the equipment in secret and fuck it using 51% attacks.

So your artificial scarcity is determined by the miners, the miners only exist as long fools put money into the system, once they can’t get their costs covered using fiat, the miners are gone and your whole network collapses.
@_date: 2018-09-29 03:34:33
miners only exist because they can get fiat, no more fiat, no more miners, no more bitcoin. Once there was 147m bitcoin, but apparently you don’t remember that.

Imagine being paid in bitcoin, where the fees for a transaction managed to spike to a level thats equals a month of your salary. Banking the poor people in bitcoin is laughable moronic.

Bitcoin was successful double spend in 2013 repeatedly. Now Bitmain may soon have the ability to do so. They may not be interested in doing so, but if the price keeps dropping and they are pushed to the brink of bankruptcy, no one knows if they would do one hail marry before going under.

I’ve done several bank transfers for free, why is paying 4 cents better? Let alone the looses from converting to bitcoin and back.

Get a better deal, but if I had 280M I’ve probably not care about $2.

Wonder if he has insurance, all those miners properly already mining under water, pure luck with that flooding.

News has nothing to do with it, there is no demand, no one puts fiat into the system.

1 day, copy Bitcoin code, rename, make sure it creates own network, build, release.

The most efficient one will squeeze out the others, properly leaving Bitmain in control of everything as they create the best mining rigs. Once the others are dead, they can turn off equipment until profitability is high enough while still keeping others out.

He's right.

Why do you need them? You got any of the “we hacked you, send us bitcoin or we’ll post your nudes” scam mails?

The irony in that a middle man is required to transfer bitcoin. Try transferring without a miner.

Bitcoin lost more purchasing power in the last 6 months, than the dollar in 30 years.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:40:42
Blocking out the numbers....
So you went from $50 to $213.

Why use bitcoin at all, they could make a exchange that sold lightning coins and allowed to redeem them too. 1:1 with USD. Cut out the middle man called bitcoin. We could call it VISA.

1 week in isolation in a nonstop lit room and you'll handover that key of your own free will.

Bitcoin is not scarce, I can launch 10 bitcoin networks with a mouse click. 100% the same thing, just a different name.
Just because something is scarce, doesn't mean it's more valuable in any way. Ruthenium is more scarce than gold, yet you can get it for $65/oz but gold is $1250/oz.
Claiming bitcoin has more utility than gold and fiat is laughable, it has existed for 10 years and yet is used for nothing else than playing chicken with other people. Who will hold the bag.
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:50:30
At the bitcoin high, he would have to pay a week earnings just to open and close a lightning channel once. Bitcoin isn't for poor people, they would be rekt'ed the second the fees goes bananas. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:37:12
They either fork and increase the limit, miners go bust or you start paying tons of money per transaction that suddenly isn’t subsidized by rewards anymore.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:41:44
Yeah, don't take gamling advice from someone almost still a minor.
Except two pumps it's still flatlining as in the past months. It will eventually drop again, just as it has after a few pump/dumps at the other levels.
Even after a 10K coin volume pump, it only managed to rise the price $200-$300. Barely.
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:13:19
They need USD or euro, Bitcoin dropped in the last months tripling  the price of goods and services.

Mining is a cost, it backs nothing. Just because you produce paintings that cost you $6600 to make, doesn't mean someone will buy it for that price. There is only two options, shutdown or lose money.

Miners needs expenses paid, they burn best case (every one uses anitminers and China at $0.04 per kW) $4M a day. They burned through your $100M in 25 days.

Well, how many own a huge oversized black dildo? Properly less than 0.0001%. So I guess black dildos have a growth potential of &gt;600000X in terms of userbase size. Apprently you're all in the wrong business. It's all just getting started.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:10:45
Until they change the rules or when you realise the scarcity is deemed by demand not an artificial limit.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:28:29
Nothing in your link says that and there is no evidence that it's because of crypto in anyway.
