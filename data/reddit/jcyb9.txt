My plumber has opinions about bitcoin too.  Not mentioning my wife's hairdresser.
Well, better late than never...

I'll definitely

Got another one, then! Found in related or from another post, I don't remember: it's by teamHODL, published in Oct, 2017 before the storm.

Thanks for the reply!
I'm expressing an absolutely personal opinion about your anyway beautiful t-shirts: the bitcoin symbol has lost its "elitist" meaning it had, say, 4-5 years ago, so someone like me would find it superflous in a t-shirt.
Now that my plumber, my wife's hairddresser and Paul Krugman talk about Bitcoin every day, I'd rather buy a shirt that only another 
 "brother in  would recognize, with no B logo.
I know that big numbers will be made by purchases from plumbers and the many Krugman's fans out there, but I just have a different taste for t-shirts. :)

It's for bank employees, I think...

You have to take volumes in account, not only prices. If bcash volumes are neglibles, it's not a contradiction having both going up.
I don't know if they are, actually.
Price is a widespread information, volumes are not.
I mean volumes of trade, not the number of coins in circulation.

I got this from another post (based on the famous Vitas, the singer, video) :

I'm curious: does he sing in standard Romanian or can you hear some local (Transylvanian?) or Ethnic idioms?

Sounds like 
I'd prefer to be buried with my war horse and my thousand concubines, but maybe I'm too old fashion.

The singer is Sandu Ciorba, a Romanian singer of Roma ethnicity from Transylvania. This is the original video

The US dollar has no intrinsic value too, but its value on currency markets is still high because it's the only mean to buy things that have a very high intrinsic value: oil and cocaine.
USN fleet and nukes also give their contribution to the value of the dollar. 
The BTC is like gold: very heavy and expensive to move and with a capped supply. 
Gold also has almost zero intrinsic value too because it has a quite limited use in industry. Its value is given by jewelry and jewelry is the mean to have access to one of the most precious commodity in the world: that thing that women have monopoly on.
It' just as simple as that, so don't bother and use the right crypto for the right purpose.
I kept it simple for you dumb americans, but I apologize for using "its" and "it's" in the correct way.

I trusted my wallet (blockchain.info). Now I learned the lesson.
BTW my transaction went fine after 15 hours.
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:41:35
Oh well: I have a 4 hours old transaction with no confirmations and a fee of 104.204 satoshis/B (which should be enough). :(
