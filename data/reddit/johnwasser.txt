Increasing the number of decimals is no more “printing money” than allowing you to spend tenths of a penny makes you richer.  Everyone still have exactly the same amount of Bitcoin they had before. They can just move smaller portions of it.

But the number of Bitcoins doesn’t increase.  If fiat currency deflated to the point that you could buy 50 loaves of bread for a penny, wouldn’t you expect a new coin worth maybe 0.01 cents?  You could buy the one loaf of bread you want with two of those coins. It doesn’t mean that making those coins available changes anyone’s net worth or the value of a penny in any way. 
To compensate for “lost” coins we only have to add one decimal place each time 90% of existing coins are lost. How long do you expect it will take before that happens the first time? The second?  I don’t think two extra decimal places will bring future computers to their knees. 
One estimate I saw was that 6 million Bitcoins are already “lost”.  That is about 1/3rd of already mined coins and 1/4 of eventually mined. Do you see any major effect of the loss?  Are people unable to use Bitcoin because of the “lost” coins?  It appears to me that the “lost” coins are not a problem now and will not be a problem in the future.

Isn’t that how arbitration works?  Maybe too many others noticed the opportunities and created bots. Each bit is buying low and selling high so they are bringing up the price on the low side by buying and reducing the price on the high side by selling. The prices should track closely, at least as closely as the transaction fees.

In the USA, Bitcoin is taxed like capital goods. Either the Borrower still has the Bitcoin or has tax returns showing the capital gain on the Bitcoin spent or exchanged.   Are such details available through discovery?
How about the Borrower’s payment history. Doesn’t a lender typically report payment history to the credit reporting agencies?
It would be very odd for the Lender to have a Bitcoin wallet (set of one or more private addresses) that happened to contain the right number of bitcoins.  If they are telling the truth the wallet would have been created shortly before the mortgage was registered. By checking the history of the addresses in the wallet you could determine when the wallet was created.

Dollar Cost Averaging (buying the same dollar amount at regular intervals) does not work when selling.  It guarantees that you sell more when the price is low!  My thought is that percentage of stake is the way to go.  With retirement accounts there is a  Required Minimum Distribution after a certain age (71.5?).  You take your remaining Years To Live ( the IRS has actuarial tables) and divide your holdings by that.  For example, a male at age 65 has a YTL of 21 years (you made it to 65 so there is a 50% chance you'll make it to 86).  He would sell 1/21st of his holdings that year (1/252nd per month).  As YTL drops, the percentage sold per year will also drop. The holdings will last the rest of your life ,or you can always sell earlier if you feel the price is too good to pass up.

Typically you would transfer Bitcoin by having your Bitcoin network client software post a transaction to the Bitcoin network transferring Bitcoin from addresses you own (addresses you have the private key for) to the destination address.  A less common way is to transfer ownership by handing over the private keys for one or more addresses. This is risky because: A) anyone who intercepts or listens in on the handoff can withdraw the Bitcoin.  B) Until the recipient moves the Bitcoin to an address they own, the Bitcoin has two owners. The sender can withdraw the Bitcoin any time up to the time the recipient moves it to an address they own.  For those reasons, on-network transactions are much preferred to handing over a wallet (private keys).  Of course if the Lender and Borrower in collusion...
A “wallet” is just a collection of private keys. They can be stored in a file on any file storage device, stored online, or printed on paper.  Each private key gives you the right to move Bitcoins from the matching public address to any other Bitcoin public address.  If they are telling the truth, the USB Drive will probably contain one or more files, each containing one or more private keys and the Bitcoins held at the matching public addresses will have totaled 750 at the time of the transfer.

But 5 addresses is not even close to  9% of 20,000,000 so that's doesn't help answer the question.  The top 5 addresses contain less than 4% of all Bitcoins but that doesn't help much either because each exchange could have any number of other addresses.

Of course it doesn’t matter if the price goes up. You have only made a profit if the cost of mining N coins is lower than the price at which you could have bought N coins.  If the price goes up, the coins you would have mined and the coins you could have bought appreciate at the same rate.

In general your wallet data will remain in place when you update your Bitcoin client to a new version. 
If you copy your wallet.dat file to another installation of the Bitcoin client on another system you should still be able to see and spend your Bitcoin on the new system. 
The wallet software creates a bunch of  Bitcoin addresses to send transaction change to. If you use up those addresses (100 transactions?) you will need to create a fresh backup to save the next set of change addresses.

For a 24-word phrase, the 11 bits from the last word contain 3 bits of key and 8 bits of checksum. If you have the first 23 words (in order) it is simple to list the 8 possible final words.  If you are GENERATING a new key and don’t care if the last three bits are random or not, use any of them. If you are RECOVERING a key, only the correct word will work. Try all 8 until you find the right key. 
For a 12-word phrase, the 11 bits from the last word contain 7 bits of key and 4 bits of checksum. If you have the first 11 words (in order) it is simple to list the 128 possible final words.

Two miners A and B solve block N at nearly the same time. Both broadcast their blocks. Some portion of miners, P%, see the A block first. The rest of the miners, 100%-P%, see the B block first. So P% are looking for AN+1 and the rest are looking for BN+1. The odds are in favor of whichever block got to the larger portion of miners first. Say P is 35%. There is now a 65% chance that BN+1 will be found and broadcast before AN+1. That makes it likely that BN+1 will make it to an even greater portion of the miners before AN+1. Now maybe 95% of miners are looking for BN+2. This converges fairly quickly and within a few blocks 100% of the miners are working on BN+n. The A blocks are orphaned. Consensus has been reached.

Mining pays way too much. If that were not the case we wouldn't have the hashing rate doubling every month or two. People would not be investing in more hashing power.

I don't know how efficient the hardware can get. I suspect that since the market is only about a year old there is plenty of room for improvement. Bitcoin hardware might even, out of necessity, lead to some breakthrough in computing efficiency. 
If need be the entire network can run on the mining power of a mid-range Pentium PC. Anything above that is spare power that can be turned off (slowly) without hurting the Bitcoin network.

How would the older, longer chain be "published instantaneously"?  If the current block of the consensus chain is N and the attacker chain branched off at N-50 they can't publish their N-49 because that block has already been published and has 49 confirmations. Similarly they can't publish any of their blocks AFTER N-49 (including their N+1 et.seq.) because it is not built on the established N-49. 
I can see how a 51% attacker can control what  transactions get into their blocks but I don't see how they can change the rules. If they produce blocks that don't pass the existing rules, most of the full nodes will not propagate those blocks. I'm thinking that there are far more full nodes than miners so a miner with 51% if the hash power will control a small minority of the full nodes.

Your math is a bit off. Your 100 GH/S miner can do 1 seconds work in 14 days but you need 10 minutes worth of work to mine a block. Multiply your 14 days by 600. That means close to 23 YEARS to mine a block at 100 GH/S.

You can’t generate the checksum with only 11 or 23 words. The checksum is only PART of the 12th or 24th word. You need the rest of the 12th or 24th word before you do the sha256 hash.  If you take 11 words representing 11 bits each, that’s 121 bits, not all 128 bits of your key. You need all 12 words (to represent 132 bits) then throw away the last 4 bits (one hex digit) to get your 128-bit key. Similarly, you need all 24 words (to represent 264 bits) then throw away the last 8 bits (two hex digits) to get your 256-bit key.
The rest you know: get the sha256 hash of the key and append the first 4 or 8 bits to the key. Then take the last 11 bits of the key with checksum and look up the NEW 12th or 24th word.

I think I understand now. The signature can't sign the signature part of the transaction (the opcodes). If you make an inconsequential change to the opcodes you end up with a transaction that spends the same inputs, produces the same outputs, and passes the signature test. It looks like an attempted double-spend. One or the other will make it into a block and either one will produce the correct results. If you track the contents of your wallet based on blocks you should be OK. If your client is looking for YOUR transaction to be confirmed it may get stuck if the substitute transaction is confirmed instead.

The basic idea of Public Key Cryptography is that you have two related keys, Private and Public.  You can't determine the Private key from the Public key.  Anything encrypted with the Public key can only be decrypted with the Private key and vice-versa.
You sign a message by encrypting it with your Private key.  That way it can be decrypted by your (widely published) Public key.  Since only you have the Private key the fact that the decryption can be done proves that you signed the message.

I agree that the network is not likely near 0.5 W/GH/s (the efficiency of the most efficient ASICs) but that is what the OP said they were using for an efficiency value.  I disagree that the power efficiency of the Bitcoin network is 100 or even 10 times as bad as the best case. The average ASIC is roughly half as efficient as best case (1 W/GH/s instead of 0.5 W/GH/s) with the worst being only 7.4 W/GH/s. That puts the likely power cost per block around $700, still far lower than the OP's estimate.  Absolute worst case would be about $5000, still far below $20,000.

The blockchain contains blocks. The blocks contain transactions.

Another slight twist to the Difficulty equation is that it is not used directly. A 256- bit value called Target is calculated from Difficulty.  Each attempted block hash is compared to Target. If the hash is less than Target a block has been successfully mined. As Difficulty goes up, Target goes down. Humans use Difficulty mostly because it is a much smaller number. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:52:05
You don't get Bitcoins with a Hashrate. You get Bitcoins with a hash count. It takes, on average, Difficulty times 4.2 Billion to mine a block. Look up the current Difficulty value (it changes every couple of weeks). Multiply by 4.2 Billion to get hashes per block. Divide by 25 to get hashes per Bitcoin. Divide that by how many seconds you are willing to wait for your Bitcoin (I recommend one week worth of seconds). I think the answer is about 10 TH/s. 
Note that if it takes you more than a week to mine a Bitcoin the Difficulty will likely change and you will need to re-calculate. If you set the time higher than two months you are likely to never reach the goal.

Not really "scams" because you typically DO get paid the exact amount promised. It is not their fault if a buyer is to lazy to use a mining calculator and pays far more than the contract is worth. 
The closest they come to scamming is pointing to a mining calculator that shows daily return at the current difficulty.

You can send free transactions as long as they are 1,000 bytes or fewer in size.  Transaction size is 10 bytes for the header, 34 bytes for the Output and 180 (+/-1) bytes per Input so you can consolidate FIVE Inputs per free transaction.
You need to generate a bunch of transactions that turn multiple outputs into a single output.  Repeat until your dust is consolidated.

The rate of mining blocks is set by the protocol and does not depend on the quantity of transactions.  Even if there are no transactions the block mining will continue at the same rate.  If there are too many transactions to fit in a block, some will wait for a future block.

The most efficient miners are running about 0.5 Watts per GH/s. Network hash rate is 30,000,000 GH/s so 15 Megawatts. That's as much power as used by one NFL football stadium on a game day.

Yes, you can create a longer blockchain by using a low Difficulty but the 'real' blockchain will be the one with the most work done, not just the longest.

Your wallet software will calculate a mining fee and add it to your transaction. It is based on transaction size so if your balance is made up of a lot of tiny inputs you may pay more. It should come to no more than a few cents per kilobyte.

The part of a transaction you sign to authorize spending bitcoin does not include the script that contains the signature but the hash that identifies a particular transaction DOES include the script. Someone can copy your transaction, change the script a tiny amount so your signature still works but the transaction ID changes. When they send that transaction out into the Bitcoin network it looks like you are trying to double-spend your inputs. One of the two transactions makes it into a block and the other one gets dropped as a double-spend. If you are waiting for the transaction you sent to show up in the blockchain it may never be confirmed (if the mutated transaction gets confirmed first).

It's tricky math.  One way is to multiply two very large (100 digits?) prime numbers.  It's easy to multiply but very hard to figure out which two numbers were multiplied together.
When someone 'sends' you Bitcoins they create a transaction and publish it on the blockchain.  The transaction uses, as inputs, some Outputs from previous transactions.  For each of those inputs the transaction contains the Public Key that matches the Bitcoin Address they were assigned to and a Signature that proves the transaction was written by the person who has the Private Key that matches that Public Key. The total of the Inputs is then assigned to one or more Outputs.  One of those Outputs  says "Assign 2,000,000 Satoshis to this (your) Bitcoin Address".  Once that transaction is recorded in a block on the Blockchain those output coins are yours to spend by making your own transaction.  Your wallet software takes care of tracking how many Satoshis have been assigned to all your addresses and putting together transactions when you want to spend some.

So the plan is to wait for someone to stay off the Bitcoin network for two weeks while your 100GH/S miner mines the next block with transactions you choose. As long as they stay off the Bitcoin network until you are done solo-mining a block, and when they try to re-join the network you prevent them from connecting to any node but yours, you can then feed them your selected set of transactions.
What happens next?  
For the difficulty to go down so you can provide the expected 6 blocks per hour you have to produce at least 2016 blocks. At 14 days per block that is 77 YEARS. I think your customer will figure out that something is wrong long before you can get your fake network in order.

A block is a set of transactions that have been checked for validity and confirmed with a proof of work. The proof of work shows that all of the world's hashing power tried for (on average) ten minutes to come up with a nonce that would produce a hash value for that block that falls below the current target hash value. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:27:56
You can't add a block unless the hash falls below the current target. To create that block in a reasonable amount of time, say an hour, you would need to control 1/6th of the world's hashing power. After a few hours of getting new blocks once an hour instead of once every ten minutes your customers will start looking for ways out of your walled garden, perhaps a VPN. 
Maybe, if you could sustain the ruse for a few weeks the difficulty would drop and your block time would go down closer to 20 minutes. I don't think your customers would stand for it that long.

The hash rate will grow as long as there is profit to be made.  Mining hardware will be replaced as more power-efficient mining hardware becomes available.

More likely you would tell the ATM how much cash you want, it shows a QR code you scan to get their address and Bitcoin quantity. You scan the QR code to get your wallet to send the Bitcoin. When the transaction arrives and they are satisfied the transaction is valid (check the sending balances and look for a double-spend) they dispense the cash.

The block rate is set by the protocol. Every 2016 blocks the Difficulty is adjusted to bring the block rate up or down to 10 minutes.

It would only be practical if you had a significant portion of the world's hashing power. If, say, you had 10% of the network hash rate you could generate a block about every 100 minutes.

In the US, if you bought 100 Bitcoin when the price was $1,000 and later sell those 100 Bitcoin when the price was $10,000 ($1,000,000 sale) you owe tax on the $900,000 gain.  Short Term Capital Gain if you held the Bitcoin for less than a year. Long Term Capital Gain if it was longer than a year. If you spend part of that $1,000,000 and put the remainder back into Bitcoin, you STILL owe the tax on the $900,000 gain.

Nobody sees the Public Key until you try to move coins from one of your addresses.  The spending transaction contains your Public Key but the destination is a Bitcoin Address where some or all of the bitcoins are to be sent.  The Bitcoin Address is a hash of a Public Key.  Being a hash, it can't be used to determine the Public Key.  The person sending you Bitcoin won't know your Public Address until you spend those coins. That is one of the reasons some people recommend never using a Bitcoin Address more than once.


The blockchain doesn't need your Private Key.  It just needs proof that you know the Private Key.  The Public Key you provide when you want to spend Bitcoins has to A) hash to the Bitcoin Address the coins were sent to and B) decrypt the signature which can only have been created with the matching Private Key. By being able to encrypt a signature that the Public Key can decrypt you have proven you know the Private Key.  By verifying that same Public Key hashes to the Bitcoin Address you have proven you own the address by proving you know the Private Key which matches the  Public Key which matches the Bitcoin Address.


Only the one true Private Key can encrypt a signature that can be decrypted by the Public Key.


Any other Public Key would not hash to the same Bitcoin Address and any other Private Key would not be able to encrypt a signature you can be decrypted with the Public Key that hashes to the right Bitcoin Address.


The blockchain never sees the Private Key.  It only sees the signature encrypted by the Private Key.  If the Public Key can't decrypt it then the signature is for a different Public Key.

No reason NOT to create millions of private keys except that they have almost no value.  The private keys are just big random numbers.  They MIGHT have some value if the associated Bitcoin Address has an interesting pattern.  Usually "vanity" addresses have a short word or someone's name or initials as the first few alphabetic characters.
You would have to find buyers ignorant enough not to know that it is very dangerous to use an address generated by someone else.  That someone else can steal all of the Bitcoin at that address any time they want.

Exactly the same way a Canadian debit card connected to a bank account containing Canadian dollars can be used to buy stuff in the USA that is priced in USD. 
The terminal sends your account number to the clearing house. The clearing house checks with the holder of your account to see if you have enough money to cover the debit. If your balance is high enough the debit is finalized. The charge is converted to Bitcoin and debited from your account. For this to happen the company holding your account would keep your Bitcoins in a address that they control.

Remember, the important part is not the Bitcoin Address. The important part is the Private Key stored in your wallet. If anyone gets that key they can spend any Bitcoins at that address.

"You only have to trust them for as long as it takes to transfer the balance of the private key to a key that you control" and wait for a few confirmations to provide assurance that those Bitcoins have not been double-spent. :(.

Your addresses Public Key is published when you spend from that address. Many wallets use a new address for change from a spend transaction so if your address only contains one 'output' your old address would be emptied at the same time the Public Key is published. That would keep that address safe from quantum computing attacks. If your wallet always uses all outputs at an address and moves the change to a new address your entire balance would be safe. 
For example, if address A received two outputs: X of 2 BTC and Y of 3 BTC and you wanted to send 1 BTC to address B a typical wallet might say "From output X send 1 BTC to address B and 1 BTC to change address C which I just created. Here is the Public Key to address A to prove I can spend output X". That leaves output Y at address A to be plundered! A safer thing would be to send using both X and Y with 1 BTC going to address B and 4 BTC going to the change address C. That leaves address A empty so the quantum thieves have nothing to steal.

I recently started mining more to support the network than to make a profit.  I bought a 10-pack of Block Erupters for $299 on eBay.  The 10-port powered USB hub is still 'in transit' from China but I had an old 4-port powered USB hub.  Unfirtunately the ports are too close together to put Erupters in adjacent ports so I can only fit two.  Those two use 5W and run about 670 Mh/s (a little faster than your Radeon and much more efficient).  They make about 0.003 bitcoins a day.  Even when I get all 10 running it will be 0.015 bitcoins a day or over two months per bitcoin.  Of course the difficulty is still skyrocketing so it may be years to break even, even ignoring power and cooling costs.

The difficulty is adjusted to match the network hash rate to the desired block rate (average of 10 minutes each).  The difficulty will level out when the network hash rate stops growing.

Maybe in a few years. :)

The product arrives and the buyer sends the Private Key of the Forward wallet to the seller. What keeps the seller from emptying both wallets and getting paid double?  The key to the Forward wallet has to be encrypted with the seller's Public Key so it can't be use by the buyer and the Backward wallet key has to be encrypted with the buyer's Public Key so it can't be used by the seller.  Worst case is the seller never releases the backward key and the buyer has paid double.

Rest assured that the transaction rate limit has nothing to do with the number of miners. The block rate is adjusted to about six per hour, regardless of how much mining hardware is in use.  It is the maximum block size and the average transaction size that currently limits the transaction rate.

You can approximate lifetime payout with this formula: 0.03 BTC * Hashrate / Difficulty.  Currently the Difficulty is about 189,000,000 so 1GH/s should produce about 0.159 BTC over your lifetime. 
You could sell 'cloud mining' yourself: charge well over 0.159 per GH/s and give most of the money back slowly over time. No need to buy hardware or pay for electricity. :)

It appears to me from the source code that the transaction database stores a bitmap of which outputs have been spent. Once you find to he source transaction in the database you check the bitmap to see if the output has already been spent. 
Of course you can save space by deleting transaction records where all the outputs have been spent. If the source transaction is not in the database the transaction trying to spend one of those outputs is invalid.

Each Private Key (the one that will let you spend) should be as random as possible. From that is calculated the matching Public Key and from that is calculated the matching Address. 
With a deterministic wallet there is a random 'seed' and Private Keys are calculated from it. That way if you back up the seed you can re-generate the Private Keys.

Difficulty increases every 13 days or so to bring the average time for generating a block to 10 minutes. It goes upas the total hash rate goes up.

The bad PRNG on Android wasn't causing duplicate Private Keys. It was causing the Private Key to leak (become knowable) when it was used to sign multiple transactions. A part of the signature that was supposed to be completely random was using the same 'random number' more than once far more often than would happen by random chance.  If two signatures use the same 'random number' someone can figure out what Private Key was used to sign the transaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:59:18
It takes, on average, Difficulty * 2^32 hashes to find a block. Divide that by your Hashrate to get seconds between blocks. Divide that into seconds per month (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) to get blocks per month. Multiply by 25 to get Bitcoins per month. Since Difficulty has been going up about 100% per month, the lifetime return is double that (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8...=2).
Once all the algebra is done the formula comes out to:
0.03 * Hashrate / Difficulty.

Some will take more then 10 minutes. Some will take less. Perhaps you just noticed a string of long times.

The shortened form of the Bitcoin address is called 'firstbits' and it is enough of the address to be very probably unique. That is what is printed on the outside of the coin. The Private Key needed to spend the coin is a QR code hidden under a sticker.

Does this quote from their FAQ answer your question?
"How can I calculate expected returns?
The potential earning on a contract is determined by a number of factors; Hash Rate, Duration, &amp; The level of difficulty over the duration of your contract. A tool we often use to estimate expected returns is the profit calculator on bitcoinx,com; For example to find the potential returns for a Platinum Contract (20GHash/s) enter the hash rate, and calculate the daily return, then multiply by the duration of the contract (730 days). As of today (2nd November 2013), the estimated return is 18.761BTC"

Yes. It gets a little more complex because each address doesn't have a simple 'balance'. They have a list of Transaction Outputs. If your 'balance' of 10 came from two transactions of 6 and 4 your wallet can use either or both as the inputs to a spending transaction: 4, 6, or 10. You can't 'spend' any other quantities. To send 3 Bitcoins your wallet will send 4 (or 6) with 3 going to the destination and the remainder (ignoring fees) to a change address. If it sends 4 and returns 1 in change to the original address that address now has transaction outputs of 1 and 6 to spend and the 'balance' would show as 7.

The rate is estimated from the time between blocks. Since that time is random the average of many blocks is used. A 24-hour average would contain about 144 blocks. A one week average would be more stable. The Difficulty adjustment is done every 2016 blocks which is roughly 14 days at the nominal 10-minute rate. 
Each block represents, on average, Difficulty times 2 to the 32nd hashes.  Divide that by the time since the last block to get hashes per second.

The block you are trying to solve will change every time you receive a solved block and every time you add a new transaction to your block. You don't work on a single block until it is solved. The reason it takes so long to find a block is that there are a lot of other miners with an chance of finding the next block first.

Different Addresses can't have the same Public Key since the Address is a hash of the Public Key.  Two different Public Keys can hash to the same Address. This is called a Hash Collision. 
When a hash collision occurs, different Private Keys can generate different Public Keys but the same Address. In that case either Private Key can spend coins at that Address. To spend coins you have to show the matching Public Key and sign the transaction with the marching Private Key. Since both Public Keys match the Address, either set of keys will work.

You can validate that the address printed on the Paper Wallet has a certain number of Bitcoin at the time you check, if you have access to the Blockchain. 
That doesn't mean that the Private Key printed on the Paper Wallet matches the address, or is valid for ANY address, or is the only copy of that Private Key. 
To make it work you need a trusted party to generate tamper-resistant paper money backed by Bitcoin. The trusted party would need to redeem their bills for Bitcoin. If each bill had a unique Bitcoin address you could have some assurance that the trusted party did not print more bills than their Bitcoin could back.

If "too many" suddenly leave at once, the rate of block discovery will be slower until the next Difficulty adjustment. I think "too many" would be roughly 50%/month but I don't anticipate a change that would suddenly cause half the miners in the world to shut down in one month.
Many miners (like myself) make a hobby of it.  The ongoing cost is negligible and my ten little Block Erupters have more than enough hashing power to support the ENTIRE network once the Difficulty drops to 1.

By my estimate your income will go negative with over $500 left to pay on the hardware.
If your electricity is free and the difficulty only goes up 50% per month you may end up with a $300 profit after a year and a half.  I think that is an optimistic estimate.

The next generation of Bitcoin wallets are supposed to be smarter about transaction fees. They will calculate recent fees for various levels of service (urgent, same day, lowest fee) and should let you specify the level of service you are willing to pay for.  This may cause fee averages to go up or down. Time will tell.

The hash is done on the 80-byte block header. The various hashes in the header cover the transactions in the block and the previous block so any difference in the combination, order, or content of transactions (including the payout address of the block reward) means that the header is unique. 
It takes, on average, ten minutes for someone in the world to find a hash below Target. Transactions happen on average about once a second. New transactions are added to the blocks in progress as they arrive (if there is room for them). If a higher priority transaction arrives it might even bump a lower-priority transaction out of the block.

Making up a convention doesn't help if it is not the convention your wallet uses. The Blockchain tracks each transaction output separately. You can SAY that you intend your wallet to be FIFO but if your wallet is LIFO or First Fit you will be spending different outputs.

The 1 MB block size is sufficient for about 7 transactions per second. The network is currently at about 1 transaction per second. As the average block size approaches 1 MB, more transactions will have to wait longer to be included in a block. Larger transactions and transactions with low fees will get stuck and will either get included eventually or will fail.  If they fail you submit them again with a higher fee.

Your phone could have a parking meter app. You enter the designation of the spot you want and the app sends Bitcoins to the proper address. That way the address is not on the meter and can't be altered. The worst someone could do is get you to pay for a different spot. 
For vending machines you could use NFC to get the address to pay. That might work for parking meters, too.

Sending a physical object might help some for some services like Paypal but the receiver could still say they what they received was not what they ordered. There is also the problem of bad checks, fraudulent checks, stolen credit cards, stolen payment accounts, etc. There is even the problem of counterfeit cash!  
About the only way to make it easy to buy Bitcoin is to have places everywhere that will exchange Bitcoin for cash (and have the equipment to check for counterfeits). Banks could do it. Convenience stores could do it. Just have to build up demand using the current system until a better system comes along.

Too bad they didn't explain what they meant by 'fake, hacked Bitcoin'. If the Bitcoins appear in your wallet they can't be faked or hacked.

Once you get one confirmation you are in good shape. That means your transaction is on a blockchain, just maybe not THE blockchain. After that the transaction fee (or lack thereof) is moot.  Additional blocks added to that chain (more confirmations) make it more certain that the block your transaction was in is part of THE blockchain and won't later be orphaned.

Once again but with fewer typos: Difficulty increases every 13 days or so to bring the average time for generating a block to 10 minutes. It goes up as the total hash rate goes up. As the total hash rate goes up, your share of the hash rate will go down and your income from mining will go down, unless you pay to upgrade your rig. Either way your profit will drop.

I would expect the infinite demand would drive up the price. Until the price becomes near infinite there will be a lot of people who will hold on to their Bitcoins. It might cost a trillion dollars to buy (effectively) all Bitcoins. 
Even if those Bitcoins are taken out of the bitcoin economy the remaining Bitcoins will just be sub-divided and people will pay millionths of a bitcoin for things.

The feature of making coins only spendable at some future time is already in the protocol. There is a scripting language I'm the transactions that allows all sorts of tests. Almost all current transactions just check the Public Key against the Address and Signature. If you know the Public Key that matches the Address and sign with the Private Key that matches the Public Key then you can spend those Bitcoins. More complex tests (Date &gt; December 25, 2015) can be included.

Mining hardware pays off in Bitcoin. If a miner can mine 1 BTC over its lifetime and costs $1000 you will make a profit if Bitcoin is worth more than that $1000 and a loss if Bitcoin is worth less than that $1000. A low Bitcoin price is bad for anyone wanting to get into mining.

At current difficulty I can mine 0.003 bitcoins per day (0.09/month) using 670 Mh/s hardware.  To get 30/month you'd need 333 times more hash power: 223 GH/s.  
Block Erupter Blades (32 Block Erupters) do about 10.6 GH/s so you'd need 21 of them at about $1000 each, then add 30% more every couple of weeks as the difficulty goes up.  I don't have time to calculate that out but over a year it should come to at least $483,000.

You can't just buy one each month. Your hashing power would go up 100% the first month but only 50% the second month and 33% the third whereas the difficulty would be going up (roughly) 100% each month. After three months you would have three times the hashing power but would need eight times the hashing power to stay even. 
You could stay even by doubling your purchase every month but that would just keep your income steady. It won't take many doublings before your expenses far outstrip your income.

Alice's Bitcoin wallet program generates and stores the Private Key. This is kept hidden to KEEP it private. It then uses the Private Key to calculate the Public Key.  It then uses the Public Key to calculate the Bitcoin Address. 


The coins were sent to a Bitcoin Address. To move any portion of those coins to a different Bitcoin Address someone (hopefully Bob) has to provide the Public Key that matches that address AND sign the transaction with the Private Key that matches the Public Key. Anyone can do the calculation that matches the Bitcoin Address with the Public Key and anyone with the Public Key can prove that the signature was created with the matching Private Key. Assuming Bob has not let anyone else get hold of his Private Key, only he can spend the Bitcoins at that Bitcoin Address by moving them to one or more other Bitcoin Addresses.
