I feel Bitcoin benefits the entire world and as a result is to my personal benefit also. I see myself as a citizen of the world. I think it really is a matter of perception. 
The good news though is so many people can pull value from the protocol regardless of their ideals or beliefs, geographical, political or ethnic backgrounds.

if walmart started accepting bitcoin and ran a bitcoin services desk at every location they could kill visa / mastercard in less than a year...

I just get more btc as I spend em... So I'm always spending it and helping the btc economy and growing my savings in btc when I can. away from the corrupt bankers. I don't trade btc for fiat unless at cost to family or friends or to help a noob...  err beginner.
 That's why the hoarder argument is stupid imo. It's like saying I need a new tire today ill just drive on the rim of the wheel because bitcoin is deflationary. No you go get a tire from the tire place accepting bitcoin and acquire some more btc to replace it if you want to. So simple.
*tl:dr bitcoin, some people get it some people take a while longer.*

How modular is it? I'm hoping there is a simple way to export transactions into a database so that they can be queried by btc address etc without having to install a ton of extra features. 
Great job guys thanks for giving back. Have an upvote for open source.

Bitcoin kiosks really make it super convenient. We just need a price index for retailers to use to create a floor to set their prices against. using a snapshot of a bitcoin exchange isn't very accurate and volatile. 
2014 is already looking amazing for bitcoin and we are only a few days in :)

They should develop an open standard. Or some one else will and people will just use their tablets with a usb printer and make them quickly obsolete.

Don't forget this guy first sold his coins then proceeded to yell fire spreading this document saying it was 'catastrophic' for bitcoin. He must have been very disappointed when the price bounced back. Now he spends his time trying to gain relevance and credibility for his crappy blog by spreading unsubstantiated fud. His motives are clear the op is just another scum bag opportunist.

Well I personally don't treat Bitcoin as a "high interest savings account". If you do then of course that is fine and is your right and not at all a bad thing. That is the beauty of bitcoin. Maybe not everyone views the world the way you do. '
Simply, and to avoid a long worded response, I like to spend Bitcoin and receive bitcoin because I think it is **better** money and with time it only gets better. And side note If I have bitcoin which I do. I will support business that support it when I have the opportunity to... because that helps secure the bitcoin economy and yours (and my and everyone else's) "high interest savings account."

China's bitcoin market demand is fueled by developments in the rest of the world. They see it sticking so they want in. Overstock and people accepting and using and making things convenient for bitcoin use give it value. China's market reacts to other markets they are just bigger. One hand washes the other.
**tl;dr:  op is incorrect**.

Thank you, I appreciate the sentiment.
