This video is totally missleading.
Bob doesn't need to open a payment channel with the coffe store, he opens the channel with the LN. 
That's totally different because Bob actually connects to everyone in the network. Opening a payment channel 1-1 it's NOT using the LN. 
I understand that if Bob opens the channel and then the coffe shop opens others channels he eventually gets connected to the LN, but it has to be explained in a proper way.
It's like opening a tab in a bar (paid in advance) but it's also like connecting that tab (to receive and send money)  to everyone in the world that uses any implementation of the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:29:10
But why?? LN it's quite secure. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:18:32
I'm crying. Top notch. Nailed it!!
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:39:38
Didnt like the date questions either
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:46:10
Is there  a source? Thanks

As an Argentinian I can tell you that I'd rather take my chances with Tether rather than USD in an Argentinian bank. But it doesn't matter anyway because we have BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:00:25
Actually that's the more healthy thing to do
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:24:47
" I'm teaching my girlfriend about Bitcoin. But instead of the blockchain I use "the brickstring" is gonna be top-post. Gurantee.
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:28:57
Sure it is. Even so it may be more secure, at least in short term, than argentinian banks.
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:31:54
People in Argentina can have a savings account in USD. But every now and then banks decide to keep the USD and only give pesos in return (ARS, local fiat). The catch is that they use the official exchange rate so they can confiscate up to 70% or so of the value of the savings.  
So most people hold USD physically.

Nothing. It just means nothing. it´s a shitty index all around.
@_date: 2018-09-24 23:16:34
I came here JUST for this. Leave blockchains to corpo!!!
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:19:15
I've heard about it but never seen the video before. It's just too good! 
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:00:33
Discretely dead-dropped on USB sticks in public parks would make quite more interesting. XD 
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:02:11
Spend some BTC on a better screen. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:45:11
"when I eventually try to spend and 50% is eaten up by fees." 
You are outdated. Using segwit current fee it´s about 3 sat/b. 
And you can even pay less and consolidate wallet if you want to. There´s no need for LN now to save on fees.
Good luck with the 1TB block on Bcash :P
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:31:26
Of course it does: Less data = less fee. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:57:51
Sorry 0,115, sorry 0,12 and 0,1 of someshitfork. Sorry...

Fake news, AGAIN. 
I´ m from Argentina, great BTC communnity but it´ s almost impossible to see even one BTC ATM, even less chances of seeing one working.
Dunno who spams this fake news every 3 months but we are getting tired of it. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:38:51
Actually they are starting to trade Bcash too. And one of it's founders called BCH the real Bitcoin in Twitter. :(
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:40:56
It' funny when people talks about "not touching" BTC. Like if it where possibly to touch it. :P
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:08:29
Never seen it before. Thxs for posting
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:45:06
Ps.: what really matters it´s "the blockchain" .
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:10:51
First time in hashnode. No downvote button? Why?
@_date: 2018-10-12 09:44:23
Sure it´ll be great, like petro. Because who needs a descentralized uncensorable global coin? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:09:34
No lo había pensado. Podría ser.
@_date: 2017-08-10 10:20:32
No tengo drama pero nunca hice un envío internacional. :/

When you are hodling, living in Argentina and drinking "mate". 
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:05:33
BTC holders that want to get ico tokens, kitties or some other shit like that
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:52:44
Why did u make a minimun 1000 satoshis bet?  
One of the advantages of LN it´s to make really micro payments. I´d like to see that in action paying and receiving one digit satoshis
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:36:07
Just buy the dip. Easy pizi. 
How much dipping? Up to you. For me from 10% to 30% under ATH worked great. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:33:30
Without the oxy
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:24:42
You know, you can choose NOT to pay the taxes. 
And if you handle things properly it's not even a crime.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:22:17
"No, sorry. I have a low time preference and prefer to spend it later with better whores" 
Too much?
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:25:58
Not in my country.

Unjust enrichment is not tolerated legally in any jurisdiction and it's immoral. They should give it back. 
Another thing is if it's worthy the huge amount of time a lawyer would need to do such a claim with such a low chance of success.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:43:02
I'm a lawyer at my own solo practice firm in a small city  and I started emailing clients that I take BTC as payment, offering a 15% discount. 
So far nobody paid with it but asked about it so I created awareness.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:09:18
Don't forget Metcalfe's law.

@_date: 2019-04-24 11:11:18
Awesome!  
Imagine it done in iron, like half a meter long, to put over a table. With the light coming out as leds and a smallscreen which only shows the current bock height. :)   
I can assure that if you manage to do it you could sell it for a lot of BTC.

Todos los servicios de exchange en Argentina hacen KYC. Y en este caso además te rompeen el toor con el precio. Así que cuidado.

Long term no effect. Middle term governments try to incarcerate every node owner and fail. Short term FUD.
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:26:18
Are you already getting kidnapped like once a day or not yet?
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:31:25
Great defense vs a $5usd wrench attack. Other than that I don't understand why would you want to lose temporary control over your BTCs. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:48:49
Or how tulips work
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:34:37
I want to mine my own BTCs using energy from my Tesla roof. :) (Or run a lame node at least if ASIC continues)
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:17:24
Excellent video!!! 
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:07:16
Sign says "aceitamos BTC" which in spanish means he oils them. Then they run smoothly over the network with fast confirmations and low fees. Epic win. ,��
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:19:33
How do you comply KYC and AML rules?  
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:16:01
All this "official" rolling out... doesn´t make you think sometimes that the bitcoin network policy it´s actually quite centralized?
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:16:37
Sure. Or you can just hodl the BTC payments and spend fiat for your expenses. Gresham's law.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:57:47
It depends on the context. Mostly on how much are the interest rates. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 19:36:12
Aantonop? Is that you?
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:31:15
Holding fiat it's just the same thing. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:50:21
Yes. 
Read it in full twice and every time I have spare time I do it again. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:12:20
Why use it? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:01:36
No, its not.  is squatted right now but without.any tweets
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:04:49
BTC over NYC sky? Don't think so. 
Did you get a bitlicense to paint that?  :P
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:19:11
I'm a lawyer and do some  jobs working at distance. When I ask the payment to every client that has to pay me from distance I inform them the price and tell them they should deposit the fiat in bank account xxxx. In the next line I tell them that I also accept BTC offering  20% discount with this payment method and that they should deposit in this address xxxx. 
So far nobody paid in BTC  but I generated curiosity and I know they keep thinking they could have saved some bucks using BTC. 
I encourage EVERYONE to do this since it's a great way to promote BTC to no-coiners and to not-yet-coiners. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 11:09:11
I'm offering 20% discount. Still haven't made one sell in BTC. (But keep raising awareness :) )
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:15:19
53% inflation in 7 years!! Please give me that. I´ve just had 48% only during last year. And 40% devaluation of my local fiat in less than a month.   
Argentina sucks bad.
