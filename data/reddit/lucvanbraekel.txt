Spot on. "Know your customer" does not only apply for withdrawals but just as well for deposits. Bitgold's reply did not explain why they accepted the deposit but refused the withdrawal. I find their official response inadequate.

Interesting and important question!  Apparently your mnemonic seed enables you to restore your wallet into compatible software wallets. Go to [trezor apps]( in the Trezor web documentation and jump to the "recovering funds without Trezor device" chapter. Mycelium and Electrum are among those listed.

I'm glad I read your informational report, because it says "If You Send BTC From Coinbase.com You Can’t Claim Your Factoids".  If I hadn't read that, I would have sent BTC from Coinbase. Nowhere on Koinify did I read anything about needing the private keys of my Bitcoin wallet to claim my Factoids. Koinify gave me a master passphrase that will be needed "to send or access software tokens purchased on Koinify". Are you sure that I will need the private keys of my Bitcoin wallet?

I can confirm what tito13kfm writes. I have AT&amp;T uVerse with Gigapower. I can login into my residential gateway, switch the firewall on or off, forward ports to local devices, etc.  Of course if you don't forward port 8333 to any local device or you don't enable UPnP then your Bitcoin node can't be reached from the outside.
I just started up bitcoind which I had installed but wasn't currently running, and it's accepting incoming connections... of course with proper port forwarding.
