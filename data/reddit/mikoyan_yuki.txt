Like everything else on earth; "this (insert cool new thing) can't be fucked with, no, there's no way they can get it"
Months/years later
"Ok I know I was using this as a positive aspect of (insert cool new thing) but now it's just like the bullshit I was talking about before, now let me brush-off what I was listing as a great feature as now totally pointless". 
Agreed with others, spin it however you want but so much for decentralized.

If you can casually pick up a penny at random within one second you deserve to make 36 dollars an hour. 
Especially if you can consistently pick up individual pennies wherever you are at any time within one second. 
I'll settle for 1800 pennies thank you very much. Maybe 900 pennies so I don't have a jingling pocket all day and so I have time to put that into a wallet.

The problem is you present the evidence and simply because it isn't true immediately you're a bastard and ignored. Then a few weeks/months later it's gone and everyone is saying "why didn't anyone warn me?" Or "we ignored obvious warning signs". 
Not allowing the bears in to speak their mind loses millions of dollars if the coin is going for a crash. So wishful thinking trumps rational economics, and then you get to "I should have sold at 14k,12k,9k,6k,4k,2k,500,200,50....but everyone on that silenced and taken over subreddit said that it'd be worth 80mil by March/April/May/June/July/August".
That or "hey the stock ticker looks like a duck, which means very clearly that everything will be a-ok, because duck shaped anomaly". I mean fine, if we're going to resort to that as an indicator maybe I can read palms for Bitcoin predictions. Basically don't groupthink yourselves a challenger mission by ignoring the warning signs before launch.

Never thought someone could make the Statue of Liberty look like Benito Mousollini's head. 
But something about this did just that. And yes I spelled the name wrong, autocorrect won't work with dictators names.
