I recently got my Trezor and I am very happy with it, now a friend asked me something and I haven't found an answer yet so maybe you guys can help me here.
Let's say put my Trezor somewhere safe and in 10 years I get it out again to cash in massive $$$.
BUT WAIT oh noes the Trezor is done for, somehow kaputt. 
I still have my mnemonic recovery seeds, but 10 years from now the Trezor Company is gone. 
Are the coins now gone for good, without a working Trezor to restore the seeds to?

Log in onto your desktop browser. Then on the right hand corner click on your username. On the freshly loaded windows you can check your comments, your upvoted and downvoted stuff.
Since I never bothered for downvoted I just recently saw that I have tons of downvoted stuff, so my account has been compromised for quite a while now. (usually I just browse on the mobile app.)

Woot! Great news! Of course, the price will drop now because everyone who speculated on "free money" due to getting B2X to their BTC will sell now. But that's good it will get up soon enough

Same here! Every post on Bitcoin Cash has been upvoted and everyone here downvoted. This will take some time to make it right again.

Same here. :-/ just going through all my downvotes. And it was from brazil too. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:50:08
Happened to me too. Just going through all the downvotes. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:40:15
Same here :-/ every post in Bitcoin Trash upvoted and every post here downvoted. Took a while to correct that.

Thank you! You are a beacon of light in dark times.

A worthy sacrifice!

I asked him three times if he is sure about that because I am pretty sure it is not worth it but he insisted. So who am I to judge. Maybe he can hook it up somewhere where he doesn't have to pay for power or something. No idea

How can / should I calculate the fees? I can set it manually from my wallet but I have no clue of where to look. So any pointers are greatly appreciated.

You aren't mining so no worry.
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:17:18
Oi? Wierd but good to know, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-10-07 12:02:28
Yeah guess I'll just keep everything in the trezor and wait for the first guys to figure out the right ways to do things. :-)
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:56:14
Gah, thanks that helps. A little. 
If I have all my BTC in my Trezor wallet, and I can claim B2X due to the Hardfork and sell those, someone might take my "normal" BTC too? *confused*
