I'm disgusted that he is trying to capture a market using regulatory reform to his benefit. Not surprised, but still disgusted. 
Like you said though. Doesn't matter. Ancaps and cryptoanarchists control the infrastructure, the coins, hell even this subreddit. The ship sailed and the Alexis OhheyMeToo's of the world are still on the dock. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:02:35
Another big government advocate looking to capture the market among friends and support his investments in coinbase. You should be ashamed.

Ha! You got me this time! From now on, I'll be more careful! :p

It's been rejected now. Is there a way to view what was there while it was pending? It doesn't appear so from my experience. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:00:22
Buttercoin, the pro-regulation exchange.

 I'm curious, what does that mean in this context? By definition spammers usually do so to profit or advertise in some unsolicited way. Why would that happen here, twice from the same account, once last Thursday, then again this morning?
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:42:18
Exactly. Satoshi was crystal clear regarding bitcoin existing as a means to find a greater degree of freedom from governments. 


@_date: 2013-07-26 21:37:52
Meh. It's not "objective" though. Ancaps run basically *all* bitcoin infrastructure. It's not something they push as helpful to their "ideology" ... it's a direct manifestation of it. That it bothers some progressives at reddit is completely irrelevant. This subreddit is not a cross section of it's user base. It's a small sampling of redditors dabbling in the world of anarcho capitalism. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:08:49
You've been arguing the core tenet of objectivism. A certain type of minarchist libertarianism that advocatesa smallish government can befunded voluntarily. The objectivist notion is that people will fill out voluntary funding sheets for government they want. Asking for citations implied you supported the Objectivist notion a viable government can both coerce (jail, go to wars, etc) and have taxation be voluntary. 
I think I see what you mean now. I completely agree that government can continue to exist in a greatly reduced state by things like you mention. That isn't a government in the sense most today would recognize... but yes, they can limp along for many years in a near nightwatch-type capacity. That's what we were saying elsewhere in the thread. This isn't something most people today (and aren't you in the UK? virtually no one in the UK) would recognize as government. 
Bitcoin kills government. Not like a bullet, but through old age. At the very least ... from the best case scenario from a "desires largish government" point of view ... it transports government back in time in a way. Before an "inflation tax" allowed for government to grow as it did in the previous century. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:55:49
Yeah. Now how many claim to be profreedom and that centralized trust based financial institutions are the problem?
I won't even go as far as OP. I will concede that anyone using bitcoin is helping end the state though. Maybe left wing anarchism can take it's place, but bitcoin use,*in itself*, is subverting government at a fundamental level.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:20:33
Exactly. That's what Knapp led with and I agree. A lot of us here agree with him from time to time, but that other 75% of the time is a real deal breaker. The guy is a horrible man. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:58:49
I prefer Turdcoin
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:27:50
That's a whole lot of ifs because perhaps, and maybe X actually means Y, lmao. 
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:31:25
First of all, yes. I'm not sure what an ancap thinks removing  a link off of a sidebar matters when probably 90% of the held bitcoin are held by ancaps, and most of the infrastructure (including the important stuff which doesn't include a subreddit) is run by them. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 09:05:46
LOL, satoshi says he created it specifically so governments couldn't attack it successfully. It's a direct attack on government itself, by design. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 11:24:08
I agree we can't be sure. If I were taking bets, I would put them at 80-20 ancap, 95-5 anarchist counting geolibertarianism and mutualism. By no means can we be certain of anything. For all we know the creator was lying about wanting greater freedom from government to begin with. 
The fact remains he created an anti-central banking  decentralized and free money though. It's the greatest experiment in Austrian monetary theory to date. It's beginning to look conclusive that Austrians are right about money. 
Jeff Tucker at mises (defacto head of the LvMI) is probably the best writer on the economics of bitcoin. He writes just about daily if you are interested in reading more. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:09:33
How about you provide evidence that people pay say ... sales tax on Amazon purchases, or income tax on scratchoff winnings? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:20:26
They don't understand that traders STRICTLY want to make money off of YOU? 
No amount of regulation will ever stop that. It becomes harder for people to pump a stock, but not impossible. Pumping a coin is marginally easier, and there is no shortage of bagholders in the penny stock world, why would altcoin trading be any different?
I feel for you, I really do. Still, you can't go around saying that people new to trading are not aware other traders want to trade them something for more than they paid. That is the point. People lie. Especially people selling something. If you have to learn that lesson in an altcoin chat, so be it. No offense meant, but c'mon. Should anyone be there at all if they, "are new to the site don't understand that" traders want their money too?
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:43:47
For portions they know about. Evasion would be easier and more common.  Eventually, actually paying taxes on contracts becomes taken about as seriously as not downloading Game of Thrones. 
Of course, that varies. Some have a boss who flies the straight and narrow, and others never pay a dime on their drywall installs or graphic design. Revenue is reduced, as well as ability to inflate. It's going to be a double whammy. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:11:24
Yeah, meaning devs and creators can't run pump schemes (if it applies, untested case law at this point anyway). Some guy who happened to get lucky with a couple of calls, then activily manipulated a few .000000 alts? Nevermind people asking for his advice ... insider trading laws don't apply because he or she isn't an insider. That is just some asshole making a tweet saying they are buying a lot of Turdcoin so you should too. People do it ALL THE TIME even under trading laws. Look at traders like Sykes or [Superman](
@_date: 2013-07-26 15:03:43
I agree with all of this. Sorry if I wasn't clear when I was saying there would be a period of mostly "voluntary" taxation very similar to what an Objectivist would advocate. That won't be a minor amount of time, I agree. Eventually though, competing services and top level goods producers will supplant most government is all, and even more eventually ... it begins to fade into irrelevance in a gradual paradigm shift. I didn't mean to imply that one day we'll wake up and some guy will invent some exchange that gets instant adoption and kills all governments worldwide by the next weekend. Eventually though, the scenario I play out where it's easy for low level interactions to be wholly within the agora is inevitable. People want that, it will happen. Even those who decry it want it. Look at the front page of place like when Amazon is forced to collect sales taxes. People aren't going to pay that shit, everyone knows it. In the interim though, yes, small scale government continues to exist despite cryptocurrency. It's unrecognizable to the mouthbreathers watching MSNBC and Fox though. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:02:11
Well, that shit is the other 75% where most everyone here would disagree with him. He is obviously right that central banking is detrimental to us all, and money and law on it should be polycentric...but a lot of the other things he writes about are just plain wrong and dangerous. When he sees something like central banking as wrong, it is an astute observation ... if it weren't for *why* he sees it as wrong (God hates interest). 
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:20:42
Yeah, they can "collect taxes"... but it's going to take people willingly paying taxes, in a sort of Randian voluntary tax system. Ancaps, and frankly most sane people, think the idea of voluntary taxation is a laughable notion, proven to be absurd time and again. It's eventually going to be dead easy for Joe sixpack to pay Billy Beerbuyer in BTC and have no government ever know about it. THen Billy can turn around and make anonymous purchases, deposit it into encrypted accounts, etc. Some of this is time prohibitive now... but make no mistake. The day is coming where people will be able to do this from phones and no government will ever know. Bitcoin *can't* be considered apolitical, because it **is** anarcho-capitalist. Thanks to crypto-anarchy and crypto-currencies, society without government is inevitable. Unless we implode first.

This is absurd. It's like asking for a citation most trees in north america have green leaves in July. I understand some of the most hardcore rothbardians who think he made *zero* mistakes, and almost every objectivist disagree with this. Still...I'm an ancap saying this is one of the only things Rothbard ever got truly wrong. Wrong in the sense he took the idea people would possibly pay government instead of private defense agencies even remotely seriously. If you want citations that the vast majority of the planet Earth disagrees with Rothbard's alacarte government theory, or objectivism as a whole and everyone else thinks there is absolutely zero chance people hand over 30% of their income for no reason whatsoever ... put voluntary taxation into google or buy a book on objectivism. That is about the only group that takes the idea remotely seriously. LMFAO

Just enjoy it. The wild west has made many a fortune. You are just the latest. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:07:34
When trading, you sell into green. Period. Full stop. 
So, let's say you want to trade a fontas pump. You know it is a pump and dump going in, like  apenny stock pump from a sykes chat back in the day or something. You buy at the announcement. It is rising instantly. What do you do?
1. Watch it go baby! I am gonna make a fortune!
2. Click sell almost immediately. 
Choosing one ensures you are a dumped on bag holder.  Choosing two ensures you are selling into green.
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:32:58
That's not fair at all. You are the one claiming that absent any chance of getting caught ... or even shamed among peers in a way virtually no one today shame someone who downloads Game of Thrones, people would pay a truly voluntary tax. This is a truly non-controversial claim ... the controversy lies among those who like bitcoin but want to pretend for the sake of appearances  that even when ubiquitous encrypted untraceable transactions become commonplace, that doesn't mean government gets less support or funding. Put up the appearances for the outside world. Whatever. Don't blow smoke up each other's asses here though.
