Jedi-esq Bitcoin Counsel - The lead-organizers of each group is on this counsel, representing their group.
Monthly events will be organized and will be held at the different groups' home-bases.
From scattered events across the globe, to large-unified events. Unify as one.

My favorite part of the article is the ridiculous comment at the bottom of it:
"Jimi Hendrix FAKED his death and became Morgan Freeman..."

Essentially: Some of the biggest bitcoin-experts explain all the newest and up-to-date technology associated with Bitcoin (as of this month), they talk about where Bitcoin is moving towards in the coming weeks, and, my personal favorite, they go into incredible detail on how to take your business into the bitcoin-century. 
(It's worth watching if you would like to download all necessary and next-gen bitcoin information into your brain)
