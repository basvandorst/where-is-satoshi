I interviewed with GEM last year, but I decided to go a different direction.
Congratulations, guys/gals at GEM. :)

their api works with the bitcoin blockchain (thereby enabling developers to build services/products **for** bitcoin).  doesn't that, by definition, mean that they are contributing to the growth of bitcoin?

I got the opportunity to do some programming work on a stock trading system.  I've always been interested in that kind of work, so I jumped on it.

Do you all realize that this sub has driven a lot of the doubters off to other subs (eg: because people here were full of (over?)confidence?

Keep in mind that that doesn't just mean that someone *used* that phrase.  "In use" means that it was used in commerce (eg: in a sale) and that the phrase continued to be used in commerce (eg: in ongoing sales).
from 
"The first use in commerce date means a bona fide sale or transportation in commerce which may lawfully be regulated by Congress.  If we break that down into the two important elements, it means that, first, it must be a bona fide sale or transportation for the first use to qualify.  And bona fide means something more than merely a token use.  It’s actually use of the mark in connection with the goods or services for the purpose of making a sale, be it advertising, marketing, whatever it might be.  And then the second element, if it was in fact bona fide, was it followed by activities providing a continuous effort or intent to use the mark.  So, you can’t simply make one sale and then abandon use of the mark moving forward, yet, try and claim rights in it.  You have to continue to have the effort made and intent to use the mark moving forward."
