Or how about just hodl it? What if Bitcoin takes off and now your $50 is $100 dollars just later this year? AND lightning network and Schorr signatures reduce transaction fee to a dollar or less? You would gain so much more in the long term than getting rid of it now.

You can take your money out. What does any of this news have anything to do with the fundamentals of cryptocurrency? Yeah, I thought so. Weak hands who don't understand the technology are being shaken out.

According to Lightning Lab's implementation, as far as I understand, their Lightning Network Daemon (LND) implements something called 'autopilot' which can automatically sets up payment channels (minimum 3 channels to a maximum 8 channels) for the wallet user, in a manner that is decentralized, and not reliant on the user. If this implementation is popular and true, there is very little way major hubs can in fact be maintained. I heard about this on the Let's Talk Bitcoin! pocast # 352. You should listen to it. It's quite informative and explains more regarding LN implementation.

I think price obsession rather than focus on the technology of the protocol is much more distracting than politics in this space.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:37:17
It seems like it bothers you. It doesn't bother the Bitcoin protocol one bit. In fact, I don't think anyone's political beliefs bothers the bitcoin protocol either, unless I read the whitepaper wrong. So why should it? If anything, there needs to be less attention right now while Bitcoin works on scaling. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:53:42
I totally agree with you on the scaling issue. But I think people should be mature enough to separate personal politics with Bitcoin itself.  Even If they can't, I don't think they would be the ddiscriminating effective adopter who becomes the determining factor in Bitcoin adoption.  Think of it like another attack vector.  If Bitcoin can't survive politics, then again, the experiment has failed, and it would deserve to fail. Or, humanity just isn't ready for this technology just yet.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:14:34
 Got it. You are not all that concerned about actual things that are arguably more distracting as a community (price) or important (protocol), but choose to be triggered by a political tweet you don't agree with. You want Bitcoin to be a safe space that shields you from political microagressions.  Good luck with that.

Not even close. The court ruled that the Colorado civil rights commission demonstrated religious animus against the baker, and upon that specific ground, ruled the basis of the suit was invalid. They didn't address the issue of religious liberty at all.

Bch Has been revealed to be a power grab by unscrupulous players positioning themselves to be the upcoming crypto cartel. Bch split from the original chain because segwit removed the ability to utilize covert asicboost which gave a certain mining group an insurmountable mining advantage. Big blocks is simply a cover for this. Long term, this translates into one mining pool to rule them all as all non asicboosted pools die out or become absorbed. They also want to usurp the bitcoin name, thus very sensitive to the bcash name because their whole goal is to be ultimately called bitcoin. Through segwit2x and pumps at critical times, they seeks to degrade the main chain and gain control of the dominant chain. Bch will never be a decentralized network as it is. It is trying to be the new asset cartel.

No, that's not what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 03:05:58
Even the appeals to the first amendment do not cover all types of speech. His first amendment rights to free speech SHOULD be protected. However, he willfully and knowingly engaged in DEFAMATION, especially regarding the families of Sandy Hook. Defamation is not protected as free speech. If people realized that the 1st Amendment isn't designed as a blank check to say whatever the hell you want, reddit would be a less busy place.  Also, freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences, especially if it could affect companies and brands. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:53:06
Yes. Blacks by law were considered property and didn't even have the right to self sovereignty. Women by law couldn't vote. Gay couples by law couldn't marry or have visitation or inheritance rights. Protected classes are protected for a reason, based on past precedent of law and history, as the highest court of the land already deemed those 'rules' illegal under the Constitution. Rules for thee but not for me, indeed.

Check out this genius who can only resort to name calling as a retort

And by chance, what race were the landowners you are taking about? Since the Native Americans were the original landowners, are you saying they had the money and power? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:59:40
No that's not how it works. Privately own businesses of PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION must abide by anti-discriminatory laws enacted by federal, state and local governments, which prohibits discrimination against protected classes.  Alex Jones is HACK, and Hacks are not a protected class. Nice try though.

Garbage. If BCH stopped trying to forcibly usurp the bitcoin name and rather let it stand on its own merits, then I believe the BTC community wouldn't have a problem with it. This is one big fluff piece full of strawman and false equivalency fallacies. It is also a distraction for BCH's covert ASICBOOST capability and miner centralization.

Lol? "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars " Matthew 22:21. Jesus said that. For being so old and ancient, it's obvious you know very little outside your fox news talking points. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:06:37
So did Jesus ironically enough.
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:26:29
hehe, careful there old man, you're gonna sprain something!
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:21:02
Haha, you are so adorable!! Those money changers were local merchants in the outer court who offered financial services for foreigners to make burnt sacrifices at the Jewish temple. Jesus overturned their tables because they no longer honored God, but took advantage of the temple for greed and profit.  If I'm going to stop and listen, it's going to be someone who know's what they're talking about! :D
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:27:14
I'm not talking about speculator's value. I'm talking about the long term societal value cryptocurrency has.  If you don't understand the value of trustless decentralized networks, then please do not opine on it. It makes you look bad. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:01:11
It's obvious you do not understand the solutions cryptocurrency has brought to society. Go learn about it first before declaring its value. Your level of hubris is cringe worthy.
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:35:39
You do realize you answered your own question right? Who caused the 2008 crisis to begin with? and with what financial system were they able to do it with?
I'm actually laughing because I see your own belief that those in power would rather cause the world to burn than transition smoothly to 'advanced financial technology.' 
Do you see how ironic your post is?
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:42:59
Ok. You win. Your trolling is too strong for my patience.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:24:29
Sure. You as a crypto holder blame crypto holders for wanting to burn the world while defending the world burners. lol.
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:03:06
Fair enough. Perhaps another time. And a different thread.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:18:57
I'm wondering, do you think price depression could be intentionally used to centralize mining even more? No FUD, just curious.
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:29:44
No. It's the most plausible because any imperceptible advantage of efficiency increases greatly over time. This principle works across many economic landscapes and is easily observable once you know what to look for.

Just as responsible? Shoot, so I guess accepting a predatory loan is the same as giving one. Makes total sense.
