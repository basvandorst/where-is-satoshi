I Have been using mycelium for a while, over a year. no issues held 1.5 Bitcoins at once but usually just hold anywhere from.     .1 to 1 Bitcoin not for large amounts Trezor is perfect for large amounts. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:34:32
And my phone screen broke so I bought a new one and use the seed back up to recover the Bitcoin on old phone   and still using the same account on mycelium 
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:36:22
Not sure but that's not going to happen anytime soon. By then Bitcoin will be too big to fail for sure.

@_date: 2017-01-15 03:16:57
Small amounts under 1 bitcoin Mycelium  app ....larger quantity use a hardware wallet Trezor what i use or ledger or if dont want to spend money a paper wallet ....make sure you write your 12 or 24 word seed back up in case u lose your phone or hardware wallet ..
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:28:58
Yes I've  have like 10 different wallets i experimented with paper wallets.. with a passphrase. .but I've been using mycelium for 1 year same wallet with over 300 transactions made each a new address ..lost my phone twice  got a new one downloaded mycelium again put in 12 words back and running with all my keys and my bits ..and trezor is for large amounts of bits i would say 2 or more bit coins with a passphrase meaning if  u forget this passphrase you wont be able to restore you wallet with the 24 word back up but its safer in case somehow your 24 word backup gets stolen or compromised somehow.
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:21:15
U seem optimistic. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:54:47

Do some research dude dont just talk up your ass theres plenty of talk and knowledge about quantum computers in bitcoin your not the first and brightest person to bring this up as we speak if you  do not reuse same address bitcoins are safe with quantum computer. .also all needs to be done is a soft fork to use quantum computer resistant cryptography and bitcoin community not worried about that now not a priority  and so all that quantum computer is FUD 10  20 years too early dude 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:49:25

@_date: 2017-01-13 06:18:06
I never used multibit ...but isnt there a history of all transactions made .I use mycelium and anything like that happened it would show every single transaction ...it does show every single transaction and that would mean someone has my keys and would probably take all my bits.

As long as you have those 12 words you can restore it on all wallets. .example. ...mycelium. .breadwallet. .trezor..electrum......that 12 word back up will always carry all your bitcoins and addresses regardles what bitcoin wallet your using.
Edit . Never used blockchain.info before but if its a back up for your wallet all above is true. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:08:38

@_date: 2017-01-13 06:14:24
Im not sure but i believe they do sync ..if not the amount spent on your phone will be deducted for sure and reflect on blockchain.info..  I use mycelium on phone and trezor as my savings dont touch those bitcoins two different accounts. and yes you can restore your back up as many times as possible .

@_date: 2016-05-05 04:54:50
That laptop though! 
@_date: 2016-10-06 11:47:41
Mycelium on android is definitely a go best and safest app in my opinion.For small quantities of Bitcoin .01 to 1 bitcoin. Make sure to write down your 12 word back up very important in case phone suddenly stops working lost or stolen .keep back up in a safe location...And Trezor is for large quantities of bitcoin .also write back 12 word back up ..add passphrase dor more security. .
