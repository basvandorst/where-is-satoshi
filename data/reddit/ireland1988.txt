Looking forward to seeing the Vegeta memes again. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:16:40
LTC and ETH will gladly take this meme from you soon :)

I believe that's John Oliver.

Paper money and credit is not backed by gold any more so isn't it also... not real? The only thing that gives it value is confidence in it's value... right?
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:52:51
Really? You believe that?
@_date: 2019-10-22 20:56:20
Treu shit. Been hodling against the bills for a few years now.

Makes me wonder. What does old Ron Paul think of crypto? I assume he can't wrap his head around it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:30
Make's sense. I was one of those people as well. Although I don't subscribe to his political ideas so much anymore he opened my eyes a lot at the time. Voted for him twice.

I'm really hoping it's not a reference to pizzagate.
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:20:48
Serious believers of pizza gate are sad to see.

I put this statement at the end of my bio on my website. I work in advertising/designer and most emails I get about jobs people comment on it. To be fair I don't invest much in BTC but have a good amount of ETH and LTC. Would work for it though!

It's been such a mess since yesterday. Is it because of the conference? Increased traffic?

A bubble is growing but it's not popping any time soon. When Vitalik's on the cover of major magazines and newspapers I'll sell.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:26:33
Exactly. This bubble is just getting started. People keep comparing it to the .com bust but by the time that bubble burst it had exploded into mainstream culture and every one and their mother was trying to ride the train. I would say the majority of intelligent people I know still don't know what ETH is.

Let them fight.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:16:33
I don't feel like we've reached mania yet. Go ask a handful of people on the street what ETH is and I bet you'll be met with mostly blank stares.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:12:31
Honestly I see the ETH community trying hard not to fall into BTC bashing pretty consistently.
