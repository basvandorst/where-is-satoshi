Referring to yourself in the third person, or just laying your cock out on the table and simply saying, "I."

It's about as sexist as separate words for 'he' and 'she'

There's a few different ways of saying 'I' in Japanese. Two of these are 'watashi' and 'ore'. 'Watashi' should be used in formal settings and 'ore' should be used in casual settings and only by men.

Html5 has crap browser compatibility? What planet do you live on? And all of youtube is not flash. Iframe embeds, mobile and chrome (if you like) all use an html5 version of youtube. ARM chips can't handle flash and they vastly outnumber x86 architecture. I barely use anything other than my phone btw.

Any chance of some verification on this? I want to believe it but the two links indicate nothing except that zipzap is linked to ripple.
