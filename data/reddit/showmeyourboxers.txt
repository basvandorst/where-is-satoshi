How do you connect your ledger to your phone? NFC?

Bingo!

Except that discussion of that kind is banned on this subreddit. So no, it's not just that simple.

I know, right? I was shocked to see this post on @_date: 2016-03-17 00:14:43
It doesn't appear that he does.

I don't know whether or not money transmission laws are tyrannical or corrupt as you say. Regardless, if we want Bitcoin to be taken seriously as a serious currency that actually means something and that people treat like actual real money, then it will need to adhere to the laws of the land.  
I think your opinion on money transmission laws is a separate issue that applies to all currencies, not just this one in particular. If you have issues with the way currencies (bitcoin, the dollar, etc) are regulated, then perhaps you should try to change the laws for all currencies instead of focusing on trying to create a loop hole for this one specific currency that you happen to like.

I'm fully aware that we all got fucked up the ass with a cactus when it comes to financial crisis. However, I'm talking (as is the subject of this thread) specifically about regulations that protect our cash/checking/savings/other accounts.
My point was, this law specifically requires bitcoin exchanges/transmitters to be insured in order to protect their customers from losses. Just like non-virtual currency money transmitters. I do NOT see how this is a bad thing. You're trying to lump apples and oranges together by saying the whole system is corrupt. I'm saying that some of the regulations and laws are good. And this specific one seems to be good as well. You have yet to point out why this specific law/regulation is bad other than whining and moaning about the whole system in general.

I'm curious why you don't think our current banking regulations work? If i'm not mistaken, the last time we had major bank failures that screwed millions of people out of their money was back in the 20's before bank regulations. Since then i don't believe there have been many cases. Even in 2008, all the losses people suffered were from things other than losing money from their checking/savings accounts. (Mortgages, 401ks, investments, etc) Or am i wrong?

I understand Bitcoin just fine. However I made a mistake. (sounds like you've never done that)

I did upgrade Electrum right after I figured out I screwed up. Sadly it was too late. I'm investing in a hardware wallet soon so I can get rid of TAILS completely.

Interesting. Does including more transactions have any effect on the difficulty of the block? E.g. a 800k block vs a 80k block?
@_date: 2016-02-07 06:42:57


Wouldn't the difficulty just become easier after a while to match the network's new, lower capacity? 
@_date: 2016-02-07 06:39:30
Which two pools are you talking about? Both are Chinese pools i assume?

Out of curiosity, how do you plan to earn a living? Are you going to get a job there or just go there and live off the land? 
@_date: 2016-02-07 06:35:21
Why is it that China controls so much of the network. Do they just have more money to throw into mining or is it just cheaper to operate there? Or are westerners just not as interested and not investing much in mining operations?

Exactly. Regardless of whether or not there is valid technical merit, the community wants a pony and they've made it quite clear. If Core continues to only offer a horse, then there's no other option but to go to someone else who offers a pony. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:04:04
I think what he's saying is that if the Core devs continue to ignore the overwhelming and clear demands of the community, then the only option is the nuclear option. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 05:57:24
Very interesting. When you say that they mine on empty blocks, does this mean miners pick which transactions to include in the block before mining it? I was under the impression that blocks were mined first and they decided which transactions to include after a block was mined.

If you watch the whole thing, she talks about that very thing:

Not that it helps, but you can buy 128gb micro sd cards for about $30-$40 on Amazon. I just bought one for my node running on an rPi 3 the other day. That said, i'm not sure what i'll do when the blockchain reaches 128gb. I'll probably have to run a pruned node. Or maybe by then 256gb cards will be cheap.

I didn't realize that only some combinations of the BIP39 words produced "valid seeds". I thought any combination of the words on the list would produce valid seeds.
