There's old "onecoin" - where the joke was, there was literally "1 coin" to be mined in all - 
Then there's a new thing calling itself "onecoin" - and yes that's a scam = and there is no "coin" what so ever. It's just a big flashy hand wavy Ponzi that hasn't fallen apart yet.

While there are a thousand and one good practices they could have had, unfortunately there are no guarantees that the site did any of those easy things to secure your personal information... :/
If you stand outside the site, and weren't an insider with first hand knowledge of how it's handled, then you don't really have anything to go on - and anything they say they did are, to you, just claims. Not something you could personally verify and know.
A lot of the basic measures are easy, so there wouldn't be a lot of excuse for not doing it, but ...

I think that what's going on is that OneCoin gets people to buy into a system where they think they're buying a part of a cryptocurrency based business that will give early adopters big returns. The thing that's baffling though is what is the business, and what is this OneCoin? It doesn't seem like there is a coin, nothing to mine, or have. Just a big scheme to take people's money is what it looks like. At least altcoin makers actually usually come up with some kind of blockchain explorer and a wallet that lets you send/recieve and mine the altcoin. Here, seems like there's nothing. I'm not sure if there's been an altcoin that simply didn't even had a coin but pretended to.

This is a question you should be asking yourself already. As the world goes increasingly digital and online all the time, you have to have effective computer security.
You first have to ask yourself if you prefer the banking bailout system you already live under or not. This is the world of FDIC insured, Fed prints money, their friends get first dibs. If you like how things are now, don't go to the next step.
If you're more keen on the idea that a thriving business or economy, like a farm or a small business, is a better idea than a hoard of gold or bitcoin, then stop here.
If you prefer to hold precious metals like gold, because of the long track record of value and you're pretty sure asteroid mining making gold worthless is a long ways off, then do that and stop here.
If you need a currency, but not dollars (Swiss Francs are pretty good.) Stop here.
Now, if all the above has not made you happy, and you want a stateless currency, be-your-own-bank, etc etc. Then check out bitcoin.
Ordinary every day computers (Macs, Windows, Linux) are not normally secure enough, "as is" to secure bitcoins. 
For casuals who have more than 1.0 bitcoin but less than 100, I would recommend a hardware wallet like a Trezor, a Nano, or KeepKey (check out Amazon for purchase).  Each is going to have it's own claims of being tamperproof and reliable.
For small amounts I use Mycelium on Android. Be sure to check and test wallets with small amounts.

@_date: 2016-08-31 23:09:51
For a big market cap to get that liquid ...
Well, that would put bitcoin prices way way up though. It would have to exceed the market value of silver at least because there were times when people really could try to corner the silver market. And I think that was just two whales (a pair of brothers). 
(apparently ... : How much silver is in the world?
All the silver is worth 522 billion dollars. At around $31 an ounce that is 16 billion ounces. )
So it seems like bitcoin's price has to get north of $2500 USD before it starts to become really hard to manipulate the price...

I've used those, but lately have switched over to Mycelium Entropy for paper wallets -

Probably. And I think their network issues are overstated. A lot of the mining photos we see coming out of China show fiber optics even in remote places like that one dam. China has some of the highest high tech out there, along with wide countrysides that are low tech. But there's generally enough tech out there that they will be fine. A lot of 2meg fear is FUD. The real issue I think is that the percentage of miners that have to be on board with it has to be &gt; 95%, and the users and exchanges, wallets and more all have to be along with them before they can risk it. They'd also have to make a change probably to prevent double spends from the old network, and have to be pretty creative about it...  I think that before the ETH/ETC HF drama, people were assuming that 75% of miners is enough, but obviously it's a big problem if 25% of the mining power wants to go a more conservative direction, and the no change conservative direction is the easier path and short term safer path. Long term, you need something that people want and use.

Oh sure, that's the dark side of trusted computing, in that the people that make the hardware try to lock people into DRM and draconian copyright situations, or spy on them, etc. The hardware then is "Secure" but secure against you, the user.
I mean that I personally think that bitcoin security is still pretty difficult and it's nice to have a dedicated little computer (like a Raspberry Pi) that has a mining chip in it so it can pool up and get a few satoshis in order to jump start paying for a transaction and be a little mini hardware wallet - like a Trezor but a step more programmable.
And it's nice to have a unit of commodity type hardware that you can get started on.
I guess to summarize, I see it as like a Raspberry Pi for bitcoin. Maybe the start of a cash register system, or anything where you want to work with bitcoin but don't know all the ins and outs of handling it in hardware and just want to get to the part where it deals with bitcoin for either receiving payments or sending them along.
I guess the market has spoken because I don't know and it doesn't *seem* like there's piles of demand for this, but it might just be ahead of it's time or bitcoin is still too niche and most people in this space are rolling their own solutions on some Linux stack they like?

If by trusted computing you mean tamper proof hardware, yes, it's a good idea in this application to have rock solid hardware you trust.

I thought the 21 bitcoin computer was interesting, and how it could drive a WiFi access point / bitcoin payment system was interesting too.
How do you connect that up to some kind of sane WiFi system so that it's filtered against the kinds of things that police come to investigate?  
Eg do you set up a web proxy? block Tor, I2P, torrents, etc? 
I don't really want to have to Nanny the Internet, but people can be pretty irresponsible, and I'm not an ISP with safe harbor protection over what my users do (as long as I enforce DCMA etc).
Anyway, I thought their bitcoin computer was pretty cool but I need to see more example cookbook bitcoin business payment ideas that use it before I could probably get the hang of it.

You'd have to find a way to build up the pieces over time, maybe use a stealth address and keep all the deposits "separate" instead of pooling up somewhere obvious to someone watching.
Anyway, a million bitcoins and the auction style for the NSA tools are kind of silly :P

Well I'm happy to own the hotspot non-anonymously and face the music for whatever abuse happens, but I kind of wish that there was a "mini-ISP" rule that says something like - if you allow anonymous access then you have to have logs of date/time, protocol, source IP/port, dest IP/port, mac addresses, and keep those logs for 90 days and post them publicly or something - do that and we grant the ISP access point some kind of no-hassle pass.
Instead it feels likely they'd just chase you the ISP provider, because barking up the wrong tree is what our society does best.

Maybe, depends on if its easier to get cash out than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 22:57:38
Yeah I heard it was a pretty small number of active people that wanted the DAO fork.
For my money, I'd say it's okay for bitcoin to go slow. I can understand people feeling pretty upset if you have a lot of money in mining it and you think that a lot of value for bitcoin comes from it being able to scale way up. 
And I'm not saying I like at all every word written by Mircea Popescu, but I read what he writes about bitcoin and when I think of the kind of mind that can see a weak coin and destroy it, he's like the level of mind I think would do it. He's stated that if bitcoin grew it's blocksize he would just attack it relentlessly, so you'd have to figure out how to get people like him on board from a game theory / value perspective - eg PROVE good value in the fork, show that it's not reasonable to attack it, makes better sense to join, etc. 
So I'd say if bitcoin hardforks, they would want to go to some extreme measures to prevent doublespends, have huge consensus in place. 
I think that old coins in the hard fork would be in an interesting situation. Maybe you'd have to fork again a later year to leave old coins behind so that they couldn't hurt you, not sure. 
On the other hand, I think that bitcoins have been distributed about as fairly as you can distribute any cryptocurrency, now that they've been invented. So old coins have that legacy value.
EDIT: Anyway, here's MPs warning and I read and reread it whenever I wonder if bitcoin should hardfork:

@_date: 2016-08-29 19:45:52
But by this logic, eventually a coin that's rising in uptake by actual use, you would not be able to store all the transactions. So... don't you have to switch to SPV at some point? Because nodes weren't rewarded for having a blockchain copy, then someday the miners are full nodes but other people aren't. That's the end game unless bitcoin changes direction. Doesn't have to change direction by rewarding nodes, but could do anything.

"some say", love the attribution.
Ok, if you're going to be into bitcoin and not understand this, stay out: here you have to be your own bank, keep your bitcoin private keys private, and theft or not, if you lose control of your coins you are going to have a hell of a time undoing it. That's the whole point. This isn't money like you know it, it's a new kind of money. And much more unforgiving. And in case it's unclear what makes it better - it's that you control it and other people can't dictate to you how it gets spent, if they can even tie some bitcoin address to you and prove you control it.

The fees are supposed to be a really small and interesting afterthought. Enough to stop "spammers". Enough to make it believable that someday in a hundred years, miners will be able to live on fees, after nearly the final design is finished.
In the meantime, miners should be mining because they want bitcoin and see value in it. The value is in the consensus and in the promises to participants, like the reward schedule, the difficulty, etc.

@_date: 2018-01-19 16:37:15
Oh okay, sorry I misunderstood you.
Well if you lowered the time to 1 minute, and gave 1/10th sized rewards, you would have a few odd effects occassionally.
If went smaller, and had 6 second blocks and 1/100th rewards you would get a lot of orphans and thrashing. But it might actually be okay.
Going the other way, to 100 minute blocks and 10x the reward would be pretty slow, and kind of not worth it for adoption...
I think the current times are fine, and might even be adjustable downwards a bit, but I wouldn't over worry it?  
I think an early altcoin called Feathercoin used to have high speeds, now it's gone, I don't see it anymore on coinmarketcap, so I guess the market decided it didn't want that feature so badly? Maybe it could come back in another coin or as an evolution on bitcoin like LN.

Yes but we're also hoping that with coinbase reductions actually following through, that bitcoin supply will be limited as promised (in production, maybe the market will make supply available, as always, lots of variables are in effect) - but with less supply being mined, value should skyrocket as promises come true.
I see what you're saying better though, thanks for explaining further.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:08:07
Let me stay with you - yes it matters. Did I miss the point of something you were trying to point out??
EDIT: maybe you're trying to say that bitcoin I have has to be backed by the resources or backing of my other wealth or earnings? Uh, I kind of agree? In that, if someone is super poor, they need to go spend their money on necessities? And they don't have any to spare for a speculation? So I agree that people need to have other wealth in their life before they can take a chance on bitcoin (don't go all in, only what you can afford to lose, yadda yadda)
And that some of bitcoins function, a lot of it, doesn't depend on how many bitcoin you have (it does kind of because of the fees, but if you have 1 or more bitcoin, the fees aren't that big a deal - granted, you're stuck paying $50 to buy a lambo, but yeah, sure, it's fees kind of suck now...)
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:37:31
Yeah like JJDsource is suggesting, a lot of these could just be scams to get you to play a transaction - so they can replay it.
Or do get you to download and run a Trojan Horse wallet or miner. It preys on your greed.
Maybe some of them mean well and are real and worthy projects. But it's very hard to tell if you're not sure. 
I wish the non-scams good luck and I am not necessarily anti bitcoin forks, I kind of see why it can be the right way to make an advance as a good alternative to an altcoin.

Mostly its the old legacy system's fault, and it's supporters.

There's a lot of reasons why Eth is  and sure, you listed some of them. I'm just saying that late comers always have a new set of reasons for why they chase another coin in circles.
It used to be transaction speed and ASICs, so Litecoin existed.
Now it's smart contracts and cool new ERC20 coins on top of Ethereum and so now you have Ethereum and it's altcoin market, sure, I don't disagree.
It can and probably will switch again. Each new group arrives, realizes that they are late comers, and figures they should either buy the top dog, or speculate down the chain of existing coins, or make an all new coin that solves an interesting problem and get rich from there.
They get creative and new coins happen. Some are scams, some are legit, most only exist because in their mind bitcoin has some defect (mostly, that they don't have enough, and have very little influence over bitcoin's structure).

Let me just acknowledge that the orthodox (Keynesian) economic point of view is that a currency should be slightly inflationary, for reasons that they deeply believe in.
Bitcoin can't be too scarce because it's divisible to many trivial decimal places and it can be divided again.
But, given how markets actually work in reality, prices for things lurch between being outrageously expensive to outrageously cheap, as the market seeks out to bid up the value of assets and Greater Fool thinking takes hold and asset prices go higher, and then they crash.
So a currency where some all-knowing benevolent thing can step in to address liquidity crises is handy in a Society that doesn't like the effects of being in that back and forth lurch of boom and bust. (They do pay for that though, in their Liberty, as the forces that were previously manipulating them now still do it, but behind the scenes. Or, more mildly, there is a future GDP loss from tamping everything down and evening it all out.)
Gold probably mostly had to be abandoned as a currency because despite being portable, it was not practically divisible for day to day purchases and people had to use gold notes, and silver, silver notes, etc. 
Then those were no fun because Society (or bankers) decided that they would rather have a currency that they could fractionally issue etc. 
And that's all politics. 
I never said that value only comes from scarcity, I can make scarce things that no one values.
Currencies pop up spontaneously when a group of people have a need for one and they last as currencies until someone has something better.
Also, I fully expect that as long as bitcoin is more valuable (appreciating, despite wild volatility in notional price) than cash, then people will prefer to hold bitcoin and spend whatever their local cash is - for as long as others will or must accept their local cash.
Step away from dollars for example, and use something we can agree is worse - like Venezuelan bolivars. I have a lot of sympathy for the people of Venezuela, and even their government, but there is a lot of misrule and muddy thinking going on regarding currency there, so it makes a good example.
IF I am a loyal citizen of Venezuala, say I'm a dentist, so I am getting paid in bolivars, then the thing I want to do in their inflationary currency is IMMEDIATELY spend on the necessities of life that are in bolivars like food, and then as quick as I can, take any extra and buy a store of value - say, junk cars. (Actually, and relative to their currency, Venezuelans also use the dollar as a store of value/currency, and gold, but that mixes the metaphor and misses the point -- And yes, I know that there are other people that think dollars are stores of value)
That is exactly the same as dollars and bitcoin. Dollars are like Bolivars, and junk cars are like bitcoin. Yes obviously bitcoin is better than junk cars, but you see what I mean. Store of value and currency are maybe a bit opposite. I used to hope that bitcoin would be a currency, and maybe with Lightning Network it can sort of be, but the on chain settlement given current constraints and high fee costs pretty much precludes it being a currency PLUS dollars don't appreciate in value doubling in value in a year, so why would I spend bitcoin (right now)?  I have to wait until it levels off and gets steady. But by then, bitcoin would be up there with the Swiss Franc. 
Final point or idea. I'm not saying that bitcoin, rationally, is not without logical contradictions in it's goals and aspirations. And it might fall flat on its face. 
BUT I did what you're doing and I basically talked myself out of buying bitcoin when it was $1 each. I can see with my own eyes that yes bitcoin has many logical contradictions. But I also basically don't care. This is an experiment, and it has aspirations to be a super global freedom money, and I get that that's probably not possible with bitcoin as it is, but frankly, I don't give a damn.

I liked the image of the quote where futures markets exist to prevent there being any hedge in any other asset against government devaluation of the currency.
I think it makes an interesting point. Counterpoint though, once we get a cryptocurrency that is usable as a unit of account by itself, THEN you can't buy or futures it away in a unit of account that's slipping.
Example - if you have a futures market against bitcoin, and your money is the Zimbabwae dollar, well ..... I guess you could short bitcoin and make more .... Zim dollars. But eventually, you have lots of Zim dollars and no bitcoin.
That's a losing game, better to hold bitcoin.

I agree that gold is not fixed in supply.
I also agree that a store of value and a currency are a bit of a contradiction. In a variation on Gresham's Law ("bad money drives out good"), anything that everyone else will take as a currency, you use as a currency, in the meantime, you hoard stores of value.

Yeah well it's always possible that a 3 year bear market is coming, so yeah? Something has to set that off. The market wants "reasons" to go into hiding sometimes.
Bitcoin is an ongoing story of something flying upwards past reasonable valuations, and then panic plunging past reasonable value, so this isn't going to change for maybe another 20 years.
There's no reason for this besides fear and greed, it doesn't make bitcoin a bubble or cease to work and have uses and value,
Because of these market gyrations are bunk. If you have bitcoin, you have the same amount next year if you don't sell, regardless of silly market stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:26:18
Okay, so tell me if I have this, if this is right
If I have a lot of little inputs, and they go to one output, that output has the sum of all the bitcoin from the inputs right? But the old inputs are now used up, are spent, do not 'exist' except as a memory in the blockchain. And the new output is some size in bytes that is small probably, not the sum of bytes of all the inputs? Nor require as an output, a signature from every input when I spend that output, going forward?
Because that's how I'm hoping this works. They don't just produce an output that is STILL made up actually of little inputs? You have one new fresh clean small output, right?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:40:53
I hear you, I just mean, specifically, that despite the price gyrations, based on whatever (avalanches are the best analogy), I still have the same amount of bitcoin I had the day before.
Sometimes when things get confusing and there's trades between bitcoin, to eth, to an ERC20 coin, or coins, and then back to Eth, and then back to bitcoin, despite allllllllll the confusing exchanges, you can come right back to bitcoin and realize you have less bitcoin than when you started. That means you're mentally using bitcoin as your unit of account and not dollars. And believe me, it's frustrating to do any buys sells or trades (in the long ago) and realize you have less bitcoin than if you had left it alone. Who cares what the market price is today, it doesn't matter.

Ah! They decided that now they wanted picture ID for my account.
Not sure, maybe the amount I accidentally left there popped in value or something, over some threshold? 
I'm guessing I had more than $10k in there at some point or $20k, whatever that IRS thing was where they came down on them. It's easy for me to provide -- but their support is so backed up they're not unlocking my account.
I'm an older guy and I have my retirement and stuff, not in crypto, so none of this super bugs me except for the inconvenience of it.
What is really inconvenient is that at some point I would need all the records they have so I can be sure my taxes are filled out right. I can kind of do it by memory and records I keep but it would be great to have it 100% accurate.
I wish that there was a physical office in my town that I could go to and a human being could unlock things. Like if I could go visit Schwab or UBS bank, anything, show them my id to their satsifaction and then get my account back?
Or if there's some goofy legal issue that they want to chase with the IRS or Fincen or some other three letter agency, can they and my lawyer work this out? I just kind of don't like the darkness of the process, whatever it is that they've made up.
I kind of wasn't expecting it, so I wish I had downloaded my transaction records from them more often. If it gets unlocked again, I will do that monthly or quarterly so that it doesn't hose me up too bad. 
I just wanted to go download 2017 records (and buy into the price dip) and that's why I noticed.

Sure but, I get the impression sometimes that miners think half their revenue should come from fees or something nutty.
I think that it bitcoin fees and blocksize never got explicitly targetted as a fraction of the coinbase reward, unlike difficulty.
So I get that I can keep wishing, but my own impression was that I would have hoped that bitcoin would adjust the blocksize to keep fees small. Probably something so that when the block reward was really smaller, like in 20 years in 5 more difficulty adjustments or so, the block reward would equal the fees reward. And in a 100 years, the rewards would be 99% fees.  But I was left with the impression that bitcoin intended to be a currency with basically negligible day to day fees. (Not negligible for spammers).

No, just a price is in various fiats. The value is in the mind of the person doing the measuring. Right now the units of account for most people are in whatever their local fiat currency is in. But I gotta tell you, for me, I routinely switch units of account in my mind (so much dollars, so much bitcoin, this much eth, that much other altcoin, etc, and sometimes I go back and go damn it, now I have less bitcoin! after some trades ... and I'm not measuring that in dollars).

But that's because they think crypto is random get rich quick Ponzi schemes
I think that the bigger problem is over in got-rich-too-fast ICOs. Things where all they had was an idea, a website, a token, maybe some half-baked code. Then suddenly 100x rich or further. Why go to work the next day on this idea? Did they really care? Or is it easier to pack it in and just give up, and be rich?

The velocity of bitcoin is clearly slower because of the fees. Decreasing the velocity of money raises its price (which feels good). But it's like a sugar rush. In search of lower fees to transfer value, people seek other forms of money (like altcoins with lower fees). So its not like fees dont matter.

Right tell me if we're on the same wavelength -- 
Pretend you and I are Bank Officers and willing to make a loan in dollars, like a small business loan, and a guy walks in and says "Hey I'm willing to sign a bitcoin message, then you know I own it! You just have to tell me the message to sign, I'll do it, then we're good!"
Scenario A, he is a scammer, we are suckers and "we say go for it, if you can sign a message on a big account, then you must be good for it":
He logs into a big miner website, which has a fun URL web page, and he can type in any message he wants, and they'll sign it at a bitcoin address - for free! Feel free to sign any message you want on their 10,000 coins. 
We don't know this, and the scammer signs a message on that that says "I own dis, gib me monie$$$" or any message we want ("Hello Bank Account officers walloon5 and alsomahlter, this proves I own it")
Or he calls a guy on the phone, and signing a message, the site will do, but they never really reveal that this person actually controlled anything.
Scenario B:
We say, send 10,000 bitcoin to *US*, and if we see it arrive, then we don't know who you scammed, but we'll keep it in a multisig wallet and we can release it with 2-of-3 - you me and the scammer.
Well that sucks, who would want that?? If you were honest, and not a scammer, now you've transferred your bitcoin to a bunch of Bank Officer malicious compliance officers who promptly lock you out of your bitcoin. You were just trying to prove that you have some collateral for a loan, not actually tie up bitcoin.
Scenario C:
We have a method to have him PROVE he has the secret keys, and it's not signing a message and it's not sending us the bitcoin, nor telling us the private key so that we could steal from him.
I think you know a solution to this problem, what was it??
Was it that we make him sign a message, but one that proves they really could choose to move bitcoin - but don't - and that they actually have control of the private key?  That way there's no one in the WORLD that would trust Random Joes to show up and sign a 10,000 bitcoin address.  
There's a way to do this right? Ring signatures? Something maybe partially outside of the bitcoin system and blockchain?
I'm sorry I don't know or don't remember the solution.
It is true that I can never prove that someone else doesn't have a copy of the private key.

High level, wealth is not something like silver or gold that you mine out of a mountain and suddenly become rich. That's something that the Spanish conquistadors and their backers and Europe generally didn't understand. So they conquered the New World as hard as they could, suddenly there was something like 7x the gold, but they were not really as much better off as they dreamed. So at the level of even whole societies there is not a lot of understanding of what makes wealth.
Bitcoin has it's genesis in the idea that things like Quantitative Easing are just a massive theft from the public. So, now bitcoin exists, and it was attempting as an experiment to be money. 
Unfortunately one of the implied things about money (like divisibility, unit of account, store of value, fungibility ...) was that transactions costs should be low too.
Because transaction costs are actually pretty high right now, that slowed down the velocity of money, and the slowing velocity became a higher price. Then speculators jumped in, drove the price to fucking moon and beyond.
So now we can buy lambos with bitcoin, but the transaction costs make buying coffee with it not feasible. To the embarrassing problems like a bitcoin conference where you can't pay your entry free in bitcoin /facepalm.
So where I'm going with this is that bitcoin could be a good money, they just need the fees to work out, and maybe LN will help it scale. 
I get that you are not keen on a deflating money supply (like gold, which bitcoin is meant to imitate and improve on)
But some things in the economy are deflationary and scarce and other things are not. It depends on what it is. If it's laptops, those get cheaper and better all the time. If it's housing, education, healthcare, those are getting more expensive.
Our little monkey brains want any kind of money that is usable as money and is a better store of value. And wherever we find it - be it bitcoin, used car parts, pearls, whatever - that's what we will trade for and prefer to own.

Well that's one scenario for collapse -- that bitcoin has some flaw that's not quite an emergency with an obvious fix, because if it was obviously flawed and obviously fixable, people can rally and fix it. But if it's subtly flawed and not obviously fixable, then yes bitcoin development can dither and dither.
But the opposite, like Ethereum where they rally around hard forks is not necessarily so great. Same with Monero (I have both coins and bitcoin) - its not obviously better that hard forks as a pace of development are so great.
What if Vitalik or Fluffypony get approached by gangsters that say flat out - make your currency do X or give us some, or we hurt you? With a community based on trusting leadership and routine hard forks, the community can get hijacked. That's a risk.

No what I mean is that coins like IOTA only exist because butthurt newcomers (people who are late to the game and have too much hustle to just spend money to buy what already exists) - they are too good to just buy bitcoin or Ethereum.

Eh, I mean MagicalTux is a lame-o, and chose PHP as a programming language and was in over his head, and kept things running when he should have closed his doors, and made poor choices, was found guilty of fraud and went to prison... I mean, I guess we can keep crucifying him if you want to, but I'm not going to throw any more rocks at him ... 
EDIT Oh, one last part where I agree with you. I do think that Justice was not 100% served in his case. I would limit his movement to keep him in Japan and under some surveillance. If it becomes clear that he has undisclosed income, then I think (obviously with bitcoin it's difficult to force people to give up private keys - sometimes it's not clear if they have them or not - until they move the keys). If he has personal wealth - like billions of dollars in value - hidden in bitcoin, then I would pierce the corporate veil and find him personally liable and distribute his personal funds to pay back - in bitcoin - the people that he defrauded. I also would make him sell his cushy condo and live in a "rabbit hutch" like a normal person, and distribute - even if it's a dollar - a share to the people he defrauded. Just symbolically he should not be able to live in luxury when he hurt people. So yes I would have gone further. I would also bar him from financial related business activities on pain of going back to jail. And from profiting from his story. So books, interviews, etc, all forbidden. But anyway, I am a bit of a hard-ass and maybe, except for letting him keep personal funds - I will always dislike that they let him get away with that - mostly, I can see why their justice system did what it did and leave it at that. I was not a victim of Mt Gox just a bystander. Victims might want to see that guy back in jail for at least 20 years.
Drug dealers ... I mean some drugs are not as bad as the Federales think they are - MDMA, marijuana, the world is not going to end over that kind of stuff. I wish that people could be responsible but they're not, and yes it's clear that the painkiller opiod crisis has led to more abuse of heroin and worse. Fine, I half agree with you there.
But murderers on the dark net? Those are all FBI dude. No one is going to kill someone else for you unless you're in the Mexican Mafia like Los Zetas. That was all made up. It always is, I hope you don't visit the dark web and think that murder for hire is real, that's like beyond normal levels of gullible. THinking you can go on the dark net to find a contract killer would make a fun story or a movie or something, but it's not reality. Those are all agents.
Next, snuff films, I know nothing about that. There are surely people making and distributing horrible content like CP etc, and surely they are using crypto or cash or creating and sharing content with each other. - I have heard but obviously I know nothing about this - that groups require trade in the content itself in order to get access - thats how that horrible shit spreads. So I seriously doubt that that was anything other than a police sting and I hope they catch lots of those bad people. 
Done? bitcoin is just a crypto, and is a tool. I believe in financial privacy. I am not some kind of criminal or tax resister. I personally think that taxes should be on very tangible things like real estate, and not on intangibles like profit (see Hollywood Accounting) and other shell games. I also dont think that income should be taxed. But I am kind of an outlier. But I also give to Caesar what is Caesar - meaning I fully 100% pay my taxes and when something is in a grey area, I take the side of it that pays the IRS what they're owed.
Over and out.

I wish that the bank had said something like:
We, as a bank, expect our employees be completely silent with our customers about any investments - property, stocks, real estate etc, and to make NO SUGGESTIONS. Because people's financial lives are extremely important to them, are confidential, and are completely respected by staff as their own private business.
To direct our clients *instead* to seek out their own fiduciary for help.
....Unless they are in a sales role. Then, "this is what the bank is selling" and the advantages and disadvantages of each, and ask investors to think for themselves about what is right for them. Both sides of investments should be offered - long foreign market stock, short foreign market stock, etc.
And in a matter of personal ethics, expects employees when they do discuss investments or speculations to disclose if they have a stake in the speculation or investment - not how much - just that they have a stake in it, and to reveal that. And to not shill garbage shitcoins for money or gifts. 
EDIT: oops just realized they want to go further - they dont even want their employees owning bitcoin. Wow, is that legal???  I choose to demand that my employees own no rap music.  Next I demand that you own no pants. By reductio ad absurdum  I demand you only own Danish cars.  Also, never leave Denmark, also, only buy car insurance from us.

It's interesting and maybe ominous.
When people throw a technology metric into things, and call bitcoin 'first generation' it hints that there is a bit of bias towards 'second and third generation' coins.
Example - privacy and security weren't top level metrics.
So what they're choosing to measure is biasing the results. That's fine, just pointing it out.
Anyway, I think that this puts front and center something interesting.
Despite the fact that bitcoin isn't Ethereum, and I've heard of colored coins before for bitcoin, why are so many groups making ERC20 / ERC223 tokens on Ethereum rather than making colored coins on bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:18:41
Ehhhh yes bitcoin is great, but stocks aren't a liability on a company.
Stocks protect shareholders from the liabilities of a company. If a company goes bankrupt, bonds get paid first, then shareholders get a claim on what remains. But it's also understood that shareholders really are partly owners of a company and share in the wealth. They're not partners in the company though, and probably not on the board nor CEO, so what a shareholder or group of shareholders can really do to steer a company is a bit limited.

Gains? 
A sale in the long ago of I think 4 bitcoin to sell to cover credit card debts. I wish I hadn't sold but that's okay.
I did wind up going back into credit card debt to finish college, so sometimes I wish I had put that into bitcoin, but other times I am happy to have finished my education for now.
Side note: bitcoin was just something I got into because I had sold my home and had some spare money and lots of spare time and a lot of unhappiness. So I bought some bitcoin and had fun with that, then decided once and for all to go to college and get the degree I never got. So it was good. I used to be very controlling with my personal finance and watch every penny, but doing that I was never going to take any risks and I would never have gone to college. I had to go into debt, I felt, just to afford it, and I'm glad I relaxed my spending rules and went for it. Now I have to pay it back, but I will just do that and be more at peace with my life choices, which was the real lesson. (I maxxed out the student loans my credit union would give out, which was surprisingly low limits like $7k, before they wouldn't lend more).
And lately did some selling of bitcoin, that was a gain technically, but I turned it into Ethereum, then sold some Ethereum (after the ATH of course, at a dollar loss) to buy some ERC20 tokens, which each successively mooned (bought at a high for each) and then sold low - buy high, sell low - so I managed to lose like 70% of the value.
The times when I "gained" I bought and never sold(!)   I think I've learned that there's never really a good time to sell. Maybe quarterly? Sell 1% each quarter? not sure.
Lol, so my advice:  No Sell!  Only Buy!
From a dollar point of view, I have gotten out everything I put in. I am probably net zero in dollars. I just now have a balance of positive bitcoin.
Oh also, if I had known (hindsight bias) that bitcoin was going to be so big, of course I would have bought assloads of bitcoin, altcoins, and never looked back. But it's nice to have an education, in case that didn't happen. If it cratered, I was going to be okay.

Now that said, the fees are caused by a free market deciding what the priority should be for disk space in a block that'll be saved forever, so it's not like the fees should be Nothing. 
And you could argue that you might want to find a sweet spot where fees are high enough to stop people from using the system like SatoshiDice does, doing micro transactions. But ... one persons spam is another person's legitimate use.

Real estate might be a really good way to move 100+ bitcoins.

For perspective, Robinhood had 2,000,000 users in October last year and gains ~140,000 a month apparently. So they might be near 2.5 million users now.
This bitcoin thing has 600k+ signed up, I don't know how many are already Robinhood accounts. There might be some overlap, but it should be a noticeable boost for them.

Not necessarily, it would just make it so that ASICs which are very specialized would be replaced by RAM - and RAM is more universal so it could turn this back into a more universally mineable currency. It might wind up using much more electricity, but be more decentralized and more available to people.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:55:24
Partly, the idea of completely trapped energy resources, like a hydro dam with no electrical cables to get the electricity anywhere --
and that from the point of view of the producer of these land-locked isolated sources of electrical power - 
that they can recoup their losses by at least selling to bitcoin miners, aluminum smelters, ANYONE, ...
The idea that any fucking bureaucratic idiot in China would ever wake up and smell the MALINVESTMENT (in random disconnected coal and hydro plants) - fat chance
Instead they want to blame bitcoin again, and here same thing, someone not understanding the idea of trapped energy resources and thinking bitcoin is the cause of all this waste .... when really, it's just idle power doing nothing, that's why it's so cheap, and that's why mining makes sense there, at whatever the market rates justify ... and apparently people really freaking want bitcoin ....

I will just agree and say that it logically doesn't matter if you have 1.0 bitcoin 1000 bitcoin or .1 bitcoin - each one is just a place that can sign messages and/or write a permanent transaction to the blockchain. It slightly matters in that transaction fees are paid in bitcoin itself ....

The conversion from bitcoin to dollars, now, are already parallel systems where someone promises to give you notional digital dollars (sometimes actual cash) for movements of bitcoin values. The systems aren't literally connected.
Example - in your normal checking account, when you log into your bank and see money there, thats actually an IOU (FDIC insured) and not actual dollars.

Sure, some market manipulation must be possible in the South Korean markets because their prices are so disconnected from the rest of the world.
But another way of looking at that is to say that it's their stupid closed won (their dollar) banking system that is allowing the manipulation.
From an outsider point of view, SK banking sounds fast easy and efficient with cool 3 hour anonymous accounts and all kinds of good things. Then you take a step back and realize how closed it is. It's not a free trade kind of thing where outsiders can easily move money around.
No one outside can really get in to help fix the prices (selling bitcoin at a high price to them).
The people inside the system are trapped. But again, it's bitcoin that is going to get the blame. When actually bitcoin is part of the freedom and liberty system.

The amounts being moved around I think are in decimal amounts and mixed, so like 100, 50, 3, mixing with 200 60 and 4. 
Then there are ring signatures as a tech so you know someone in the ring signed the transaction but not which person specifically, and it's hard to tell what mix the outputs really is.
As long as the inputs coming in match what's going out, you know that no new money was created, but you don't know who is getting it and who's getting it (well it's someone in the incomign and outgoing) but basically you just don't have a lot to go on.

He missed his chance, whatever.
He starts his book saying he went to a bitcoin conference in 2013. Sigh dude, you could have had bitcoin for some price around $400 or less. And now, we're supposed to believe you.
He is simply too proud to say, "wow my ego got in my way." And publishing books and going on shows is just more ego. Dude, dump your ego. You're not that smart.
The way I see bitcoin starts at Market price for it and says, best prediction of future value for something is the current price.
That means that no matter what bitcoin is priced at, it's got a fair value in the market. You just have to decide for yourself if you see a lot of factors that could take this higher or expand it, or lower.
He's totally convinced this is a bubble. I think that this might be something new, like a rocket going upwards, and that the percentage increases, logged out are going to look vaguely linear, but from the ground looking at this in an old-fashioned way, is going to appear to go to stratospheric heights.
I see people like this, who had all the chance in the world to catch a ride on this, and didn't, and see that bitcoin is going to ignore them and go higher.

Bitcoin can't go to new highs until it touches a bottom and then goes up. 
Weak hands are people who are in it with a short term time horizon, like a month, a quarter, or a year. Or, who foolishly put in too much money.
If bitcoin goes down in price long enough, they get demoralized. Weak hands don't have to take much in losses (like 30%+) for more than a couple months before they give up.
Strong hands can handle 2 to 3 years of 50%+ total downwards movement without selling, maybe buying a little to average down.
Then when it rebounds, they get to make huge gains when it surpasses the price they bought at (and are no longer bagholders)
Then it goes higher as people get on board, and reaches a new all time high.
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:00:23


I wouldn't do it in coin proportion, but I would do it with an eye to unit bias, and market cap. Unit bias is the thinking newbs have like "wow this altcoin is worth a penny each, what if it became a dollar someday?? $$$ ????"  So I'd give that kind of stupidity a bump. But other than that, maybe match market cap and watch out for premines and avoid memes, and try and see what is really new and different, or reaches different markets.  Trying to think ahead in crypto is super hard. I have no idea what's next.
So Ripple, premine, avoid..  bitcoin, rock solid, must be at least half of my setup. Privacy coins, my bueno. Monero = some kind of spanish sausage, very good.  Zcash 20% dev payout bleh, Zclassic looks better.  Dash staking scam. Steem junk. etc.

Right I'm not advocating 1GB blocks or anything, a x2 to x16 would be fine. It's just a throughput system.
I think that fee targetting as a fraction of the coinbase like 1/10th or 1/100th of the total coinbase would have been good. That way the blocksize would get bigger or shrink based on fee value vs coinbase value. "Ideal" would be an Oracle that knew the fees for a transaction were like 2 cents, but connecting bitcoin to an Oracle is bad.

My time horizon is too far out there to be taken seriously even in a bitcoin subreddit.
I literally couldn't care less what the current market value in imaginary money (dollars) other people think bitcoin is worth. There's what I can afford to lose and I have it in that and other things (honestly not much). 
And I don't let crypto be any big part of what I own. But to me, it just feels like this is going to be huge. Unbelievably terrifyingly huge.
But it's also possible for it all to crater and go to zero. So, that's how it goes :) and I just try to take sane risks.
Anyway, I'm not blind to what other people want to buy or sell crypto for. There are some numbers I would sell at maybe, even though it would be a hassle; there are definitely numbers I'm buying at. 
If you're selling fractions of bitcoin for under $8k, then PM me or whatever.

Yes, I just mean that in Monero, the amounts you work with are in powers of 10. So if you start with 1000 and want to pay someone 123, then that breaks out the Monero into 800 100 70 20 7 and 3. The total is the same but each decimalled amount winds up having it's own apparent destination and you can't really tell. 
Plus I think there's a mixin where it makes up faked transactions with 5 other people (I think for each one of those numbers above, like the 800 appears to go to 5 different people).
It's kind of complicated but effectively shit gets so mixed up that tracking who got what is effectively very hard (combinatorics) to work out who got paid.
Honestly, after reading how it works, I realized that Monero worked a lot more like I had assumed bitcoin would work.
To me bitcoins input and output system with more variable made up amounts, and not very good cloaking of who got paid, and also, it's very interesting programming language, those were all surprises to me :) but I don't think they're bad surprises, just interesting.  
@_date: 2019-07-10 16:51:31
Well it's kind of like why would anyone ever sell stocks? Same idea. Sometimes you need to, or want to spend and enjoy since we're not immortal. Other times, you're young and need a risky investment and want to trade risks with someone. It can be rational for each side to buy and sell the same thing.
Most investors think of a whole stock as a "sell" or a "buy", like this stock is good or bad. They don't nromally think in terms of risk/reward and time horizon.
Bitcoin is great if your time horizon is 2-5 years out, and if you're using money to buy that you don't care if bitcoin goes to 0.

First time bitcoin really got on my radar was at $1 from a Slashdot article. I was a skeptic and a Statist at the time (what is bitcoin backed by? yadda yadda) and didn't even try to buy some just to see what it was. What if I had bought $100 worth instead. Ah dammit.

"Virtual currency trading real name system 30 days ... "No new investments"
6 banks 30 days Confirmation of blindness on January 30th 
New investment will be applied to strict criteria such as blind date confirmation 
(Seoul = Yonhap News) Park Yong-joo, 30 days after the expiration date. 
From this point on, new investments in virtual money are allowed, but it is likely that more stringent standards will be applied in the process of confirming blindness.
According to the financial authorities, banks and virtual money traders on the 23rd, six banks including Nonghyup Bank, Shinhan Bank and Shinhan Bank, which are providing virtual currency exchanges and virtual accounts, Start. 
"The six banks are planning to open the system at the same time," said an official from the banks and virtual currency exchanges. 
Confirmation of blindness deposit and withdrawal service is a service that permits only the account of the trader whose identity is confirmed and the deposit and withdrawal between the same bank account of the exchange. If the exchange and the trader's account are in different banks, the trader must open a bank account like the exchange. 
A trader must go to a bank branch in person to open a bank account at another bank and check his / her name. During this process, you must present proof of your real name, such as your resident registration card or driver's license. 
Confirmation of blindness When the deposit and withdrawal system is implemented, it is possible to compare the resident registration number in addition to the name and the account number of the trader, thereby effecting the establishment of a juvenile or non-resident foreigner in the market. 
It also creates basic data for imposing transaction tax or transfer income tax related to virtual currency transactions and makes it possible to set additional transaction limit per capita in the future
When the blind deposit / withdrawal system is implemented, new investments that were previously blocked are allowed. 
The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has suspended the provision of a new virtual account for the virtual currency trader, which was presented on 28th by issuing special measures related to the virtual currency, and canceling the provision of the virtual account for the new member of the existing virtual currency trader. 
A financial official said, "There is no reason to institutionalize measures to prevent people who are new to virtual money investment from becoming blind," he said. 
However, analysts argue that it is more likely that banks will offer more stringent criteria for issuing virtual accounts, as the government recognizes virtual currency transactions as speculative. 
A bank official said, "I will respond according to the guidelines of the authorities, but it does not seem to be the case to actively open an account when reflecting the overall social atmosphere."
Financial information analysts ( FIU ) and Financial Supervisory Service ( FSS) are expected to apply guidelines for anti-money laundering related to the virtual currency of exchanges through banks that are obliged to prevent money laundering under current law. 
Banks plan to apply enhanced EDD to traders through preferred exchanges . The EDD is a way to include the customer's name (name and resident registration number), address and contact details, residence, financial transaction purpose and source of fund. 
The committee also decided to check whether the exchange strictly separates corporate funds and customer funds, and maintains records of users, such as keeping records of transactions.

It's much easier on everyone if the taxes apply if you trade or sell it, then calculate your basis in it. If you got it for nothing, then sold, then obviously you'd pay full value.

SHA256 hashes of bitcoin blocks arent usable as answers to other things directly..*
The progression of bitcoin mining was CPU, GPU, FPGA, then ASICs. ASICs for SHA256 hashing are blazing fast but only good for that.
Other coins were meant to be ASIC resistant but Litecoin and others have ASICs now. 
Some coins still use CPUs deliberately, usually by increasing the RAM requirements. Oddly, yes, CPU and RAM heavy computers could be used for other purposes, and counter intuitively that works against them
In my opinion the ideal would be GPUs that once they mine coins they cant go back to being regular GPUs. 
*there is a conspiracy theory that bitcoin is a distributed effort to crack SHA256, which I dont believe
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:01:28


I honestly think that the usage might S-curve,
But the value could go down, level, up linearly, or up logarithmically, or up exponentially. I just have no way to tell.
It's all so crazy and new to the world. It's not like other assets. With gold, if it got valuable and scarce, people could go mine more and get more supply out there.
But with bitcoin it's just withering - it will not make more supply very easily - you can kind of mine it faster but the relentlessly moving difficulty easily keeps up and the supply is very predictable. 
What you don't know is how much the market supply will be, and market supply and demand is going to set the price.
But dang if this thing isn't just so unlike anything that has ever physically existed before ... 
So time will tell.
I'd bet on it being outrageously, unbelievably valuable - or to nothing, and a lot of things in between. It's probably the most unpredictable thing out there in terms of future value.

I think it's fun watching the NYAG try to finangle some contrived way to interfere with Tether and Bitfinex.
They seized their dollar accounts with Polish help, thought that would kill the company, it didn't.
The company sounds like they want to say "hey we have no New York users" but apparently someone at the company helped investors that lived in New York create foreign shell accounts that could hold and own their funds at Bitfinex... (people at Bitfinex shouldn't have helped them with that workaround.... maybe should have just allowed advertisements on their site for services that did that, lol, like google ads, and let some other group out there offer those services)
Then post hack or something, post-interference, they tried to keep their company afloat with some token called LEO and offered to do buybacks of it. Now they want to call that a security (like stock), eh sure, but that's been a really common way for companies to survive getting hacked and bankrupted ...
But then you wonder how the NYAG even has jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, that ostensibly doesn't allow users from New York (turns out, Bitfinex used New York based auditors, and lol, NYAG argues \*that\* allows them to step in, what the fuck, how fucking flimsy. Next they'll argue people in Bitfinex wear clothes made in the NY garment district, or ate tuna in a can processed in the fish area of town, or some such fuckery. Hope that gets dismissed).
Anyway - found out the USA has legalized its foreign fuckign overreach with the Martin Act, that should obviously be repealed. Since the US has no fucking business in foreign corporations. At all.
I'm not a big fan of Bitfinex or Tether, I just dislike Big Govt more.

Nicehash does sound like the right pool to use.
AML/KYC is the first big hurdle - do you want to be anonymous or not. Decide that, and live with the consequences either way.
Don't go too overboard in mining get a basic rig going until you can see if the investment is worth it.

Lol what I love are the analysts, like which one was it lately, Morgan Stanley? (have to go find a citation)
Where they tried to figure out "Fair Market Value" for bitcoin and claimed they weren't buyers because clearly you could just go mine it for less than market price.
Begging the question - okay smarty financial wizards, if it's SO FUCKING CHEAP to go mine it rather than buy it, GO FUCKING TRY.
The real truth is bitcoin is expensive to mine and not always expensive to mine in dollars. You have to get hardware, you have to have a place to do it, economies of scale, you can't hide these massive operations - not really - and you have to pay a political price if you are going to get "cheap" or "free" electricity.
Conceptually and technically, bitcoin mining is easy. To actually do it is hard.
The real prices are what you have to pay in Western countries, and look at that, it's about $12 to $15k.

My impression is that technology is not a universally "good" force.
An example from another era is the cotton gin. This helped the economics of a slave labor system in the US South. The cotton gin lead to entrenched massive widescale slavery. My opinion
You could argue that just spreadsheets like Excel have improved business managent so much that its much easier for capitalists to manage workers, production etc, and that advances since 1970 or so have led to workers just not getting paid better. A lot of workers arent paid for their brains. Theyre basically wage slaves.

Well my theory is that Facebook and companies like it are being pressured by European govts to throw away user data, and so this is their new trick - make a money system, so that they have to keep records.
Financial regulation = "oh no don't throw me in that briar patch"
Then they'll get whatever laws they want rewritten however they like. It's kind of funny how screwed Western Union is in this situation. They're like the new Blockbuster.
Now, because users will have payments info tied to their identities, they'll be forced to validate user identities / do identity proofing, which spies love, and which is going to help with marketing, and will help with weeding out shitheads that post beheading videos on Facebook, so saves them money and grief.
Next, they'll have data for a long ass time on people. Some people, once they get involved in lawsuits, you might have to keep the data pending legal discovery yadda yadda. They could make up some side companies or even fund stuff like the ACLU to sue them, get some class action lawsuits going, something harmless though, so that they'd be forced to keep user data effectively ad infinitum. Like, do something semi shady like attempt to track people's religion or left/right conservative/liberal beliefs, something superficial but shocking. Or a "gay rating" like a "Kinsey scale" lol. Or something like "how much you like pink" or how much you click through and respond to flags (national flags, nazi flags, gay pride flags) - does that mean you're a nazi, or gay? Or just triggered?

Yes when you go short you are betting on a future lower price. When you go long you bet on a future higher price.
When you sell bitcoin short, you borrow someone else's bitcoin, immediately dump it for notional dollars (this is all inside the exchange), then wait for a future time. 
You're hoping  that at some future time, you use your exchange's dollar balance (these aren't "real dollars" necessarily) to buy back bitcoin, at a lower price, and give that bitcoin back to the person you borrowed it from through the exchange - with some interest or fee, and then pocket the difference.
But the problem is with margin, you can have shocks to the system liquidate your position, and then you're forced to spend from your balance in a bad situation when the market has moved against you, and you get closed out / stopped out / liquidated. Sometimes a lot earlier than you would have expected.

~~About half a bitcoin in 4 years. About 1/100th a bitcoin in 20.~~
EDIT: eh okay a more realistic edit.
Today's lambo priced in dollars is $300,000.   That's roundabout 30 bitcoin.
In 4 years, I think it will take about 12 bitcoin. Eg, spend $120k on bitcoin now, and wait four years. You'll have a lambo.
In 20 years, I think it will take about 1/3 of of a bitcoin. Eg, spend about $3000 on bitcoin now, and have enough for a lambo in 20 years.

I agree with you, I think if you get the 6173, your accounts are being subpoena'd all over the place. Apparently the IRS has to give you some sort of notice before they can start doing subpoena's of third parties (per the IRS slide deck leaked by that accountant and posted on Twitter about a month ago), so I bet THIS is your notice. Of course it's vague, and you don't know what's wrong or what happened.
But what happened was some chainanalysis companies sold software to the IRS, pointed it at their data and said,  "tah dah" looks like these people owe you money.
Now the IRS is just closing the loop, dotting the i's and crossing the t's. If you get 6173, get a tax attorney ASAP, do not dissemble with them, let them know whatever the truth of your situation is, let them help you. And let them do the talking to the IRS etc, Power of Attorney, etc.

I think people just hope that a central bank somewhere will take bitcoin into its reserves. A lot of current price is based on speculations on future price and value. So anything that seems positive is a win for a certain mindset. 
As much as I wish it wasn't the case, I personally think the Bulgarians either sold it off, lost it in BTC-e, or got it embezzled. I really doubt they still have it - they might, but they probably don't. It's also possible that they have it and don't at the same time, like maybe it's captured, but password protected.

I've seen people try over and over to get this upvoted. I also want it upvoted. I suspect ten cent army types of downvoting it because they don't like "China Uncensored" (an anti-Chinese Communist Party channel - well, actually they're just against what the CCP does, not it's existence. Eg: attacking Falun Gong, Tiananmen Square, cronyism, paranoia, ~~imprisoning Xuigurs~~ re-educating Muslims, invading Tibet, etc)
Anyway, it's a good take on what's going on. They are a pro-Hong Kong, pro-Taiwan channel and I think they have taken funding from Falun Gong. View them the same way you would Russia Today. Keep in mind their biases, but that doesn't make them wrong on every issue.

POW proves that scarce resources were required to validate. It can't be faked. No one makes anyone participate or mine. It just drives a reward on a supportive economic commitment. That's the genius of it.
I can see why people think it's a waste of energy. But another way of looking at it is that people are believers in "number go up" tokens.  (Scarce things that gain value or hold value).
If we all used gold, it would be like being very unhappy that people use energy to mine gold. Yes, the environmental destruction of gold mining is not okay, but it doesn't have to be so destructive, that's on us as humans to set standards.
In the meantime, the reason a money system has value, like bitcoin or gold, over fiat, is that fiat is a system that's full of cheaters that have rigged the system against us all.
If we had financial freedom to buy whatever we wanted, without interference, and without financial thoughtcrime, or surveillance, and if they did not and could not print fiat units of account and give the benefits to their friends, and it was all fair, then we wouldn't need bitcoin right.

I think the disruption of S2F to dollars will get shaken out by people making zillions of altcoins to cash in on the craze, diluting the S2F temporarily. bitcoin draws copycats into the arena, and latecoiners have their FOMO moments. After their craze dies down, and the fraction that went bitcoin did better, you see people frenzy via trading, gambling, getting sucked into scams (double your money! lend your bitcoin! &lt;-- no don't do that), etc that all is going to be a part of the story.

I think people are into bitcoin in China for a lot of reasons.
They have technophiles there too, who probably also dream of financial freedom and less restrictions on what people can invest in, and less paternalism about proper investments.
Chinese govt reacts the way it does I think because it tries to control currency exchange to the outside (keeping it's people as financial prisoners). Solving the Trilemma that way. 
And then culturally it seems like if there's ever scams or blowups or investments gone sour, people seem to expect the Chinese govt to bail them out, and the govt does not want to encourage them. It's in a Catch-22 where it wants to be all-powerful, but when things go wrong, people expect it to use the power to help them. 
So bitcoin is a problem for them. If some pensioners buy bitcoin, send it to a scammer promising to double their money, the govt gets sucked into some huge drama (okay, someone broke the law being a fraudster so of course they have to be involved, it's either that or let citizens solve disputes with violence, and we can't have that) so the govt just tries to ban bitcoin.
And they already have tons of bad loans and shadow banking, and they know they need to stop, as they have piled tons and tons of systemic risk into their system. So bitcoin is just another leak in the dam.
People in China, I think they really go out of their way to NOT politically challenge their govt. It's very dangerous to do things there if the govt doesn't like it.

Maybe it starts off as a "claim of location" as kind of a note.
I think I'd be interested in a coin that gave partial credit on Proof of Work. Like the miner that had the winning claim gets the current block, but all the miners that had partial credit on the previous block got to get in a transaction too for some of that previous block value; so like being short up to 1/16th the value was okay, and gave you a partial claim. That way you didn't really have to join big top 10 pools to have a shot at mining but could casually spread out into hundreds and hundreds of pools and have no problem with the regular payout you'd be getting.
But incentives for nodes, and for spread out mining is also very interesting. Love that people are thinking about it. Might not happen in bitcoin but could happen in some other fair coin and be leveraged later if the users really want it. The main idea is proof of work.

What's funny is that it's human nature to just want a money in the middle of all trades, and that money has to have certain properties, and being devalued is not one of the properties anyone would want ... 
The govts think they can trick people (And they can get some) into holding this trash, and they think this stimulates investment (by putting it somewhere like the stock market where it can hold value vs inflation -- but what do you do if the companies are trash and/or scams). It only forces people to not hold their fiat money and to desperately seek an alternative money that works.

Some countries don't govern with the consent of the governed. Everything they do is essentially criminal. They stomp on people's rights and a small coterie of elites and oligarchs have their paid armies point guns at people and take what they want. There is a greater or lesser degree of violence involved.
Next, some countries have some representation, but poor protection of minorities. They may seem fair and good to the majority, but oppressive and horrible to some other groups.
In even the best democracies, the role and size of government is debateable. How much should it do, how far should it go, and how much should it allocate. How much waste fraud and abuse is inherent in the system. How much out and out corruption. And, are there "war mongers" - meaning people that sell war - who get your country involved in expensive wars, which get your taxes spent on military equipment that they produce, and you get blood and treasure wasted, to enrich a few assholes.
So one day you get mugged in a dark alley and your wallet and some cash is taken. Next, you start thinking, hey wait, taxation is theft too. You get your money mugged, and you get nothing for it.
Before you shout "but who will build the roads?" consider the first kind of government, an out and out authoritarian dicatorship - a purely criminal enterprise. There, taxation, any government action at all, is CLEARLY THEFT.
The ones where it's the second kind, and you are a cruelly abused minority, where your rights are tramped constantly. The taxation actually winds up literally used by your oppressors to keep oppressing you - like if they had white and black drinking fountains - eg Apartheid South Africa, taxation is also still some kind of damn theft.
And last, even in the best governments, the average person does not and will not have any say in the size or type of taxation, nor what it gets spent on, nor has hardly any ability to affect this. And may argue that some of the services that government has taken on with taxes are outside its proper remit. And if you don't pay, they take your money, garnish it, and/or put resisters in jail at the point of a gun or a beating. (Or some kind of trial by made up laws). That's very extreme, but just helping with the point of view.
(I personally have a "Give under Caesar what is Caesar's" point of view. Dollars exist as their money token, they expect taxes paid in it, meh whatever, just pay. This is just the reality of being an ordinary pawn inside of a larger shitty system, but don't martyr yourself over taxation. Just argue harder against waste fraud and abuse, and help people imagine a fairer system, with less shitty wars, less terrible spending, less corruption, or even consequences for the corrupt, etc.)

I think you're one of the few to realize that and connect the dots.
Even if the rate of newcomers slows, as long as bitcoin's emission rate slows faster, it makes it a decent store of value.
And since newcomers add to the number of people (n) that use bitcoin, then by Metcalfe's Law the value of bitcoin (not necessarily price) should go up as n\^2
Also good point about real estate vs mobile value. It could go either way, it seems like some of globalization is this kind of entrenchment you see worldwide while people fight over their share of the pie.

I think that if you had a known position of about 3 or 4 miners (London, New York, Tokyo, Moscow, Calcutta etc) that were spread out enough,
Then you could calculate how swiftly someone could send a message to all 4. They would be fast for some and slow for others, effectively giving you a 3d position.
You could have a reward for being the fastest to all four, which is impossible unless you have great networking (like up to low earth orbit and then over. SpaceX is working on low altititude satellites and the latency in space in a vacuum is lower for laser beams than it is for lasers down fiber optics on the land below - I think about twice as fast)
Maybe think of the Earth as an icosahedron and make it so that some of them are in a known triangle (the main 3 or 4 or 5 places) and you have people with competing claims to be in the other ones. 
Most of the other ones are ocean, so it could spur ocean-going mining systems, libertarian ships, seasteading, and ocean-going Citadels.

Well technically time is not set in stone, but the direction where there is more disorder is perceived as forward in time. It's because down at the level of atoms, where they bounce off each other, you really can't tell which way is forwards or backwards in time. But in aggregate once you have enough atoms, like 100+, you can make good guesses as to whether or not a given state is forwards or backwards. At a million atoms you are very sure which way the arrow of time points. Time is an illusion man :)
But of course, at the scale of a person's atoms, the random effects are essentially one-way. Irreversible, for all practical purposes.

Yeah but for people that have actual bitcoin, not dollars or tether, having a market correction where people run to hold in tether, and then having tethers become worthless (maybe because the people who print tether wake up and print trillions tommorrow) is like the ideal meltdown scenario for a bitcoin holder.
I don't care about the existence of tether than I do the existence of any other fiat, like the euro, dollar, or yen. It's all made up money, and bitcoin (relatively) isn't. See what I mean?

I mean you can try it, but you might have to include the captcha in the blockchain (the raw image), and then you have the problem of "is this really the valid solution?"
The advantage of SHA256 is that it's really easy to prove that that's the correct hash and hard to work backwards from the raw transactions back to that hash, short of literally trying as many as you can.
I used to think it could be interesting to find some kind of folded protein value, and have people vote on the next protein to be validated, but I think that's a struggle to figure out something that doesn't feel like a "waste of energy" or "waste of effort".
I admire that you're trying to make something fair where a person participates or doesn't, and can't conceivably "scale" it, short of setting up call centers full of human beings spending their lives solving captchas which sort of sounds like a dystopian nightmare.

Just thought of something - 
DO NOT GIVE UP. Quantum computers, someday, might be able to figure out your wallet password.
Just fucking hang in there. This may be the thing that makes you rich someday :) - because you couldnt sell. For better or worse.
Here's the wallet encryption details:
I think, that the AES 256 in a wallet, call that unbreakable right now.
If you had really good quantum computers, I think that lowers it to be equivalent to AES 128, which is still unbreakable.
But damn, you can hope. I think it would take trillions of computers billions of years to crack AES 128, but it is doable.
You never know, and your wallet is holding still, so to speak. It's not evolving now to whatever the future brings.
You never know, maybe in 10 years someone somewhere will learn something about the mathematics of the thing, and remove the security from it with some great effort --- just enough effort that no one would try it unless they knew and had access to your wallet and knew what it held.
That's different than bitcoin addresses and private keys and all that.
This is only my supposition. But I would hold out. Do not give up. Learn math maybe, you have lots of time :)
Also, keep the hardware/software that you generated it on. Maybe somehow, it has a stupid flaw in how the random numbers are made. That's a wild long shot but maybe.

My take on it, when he talks about performance of bitcoin as a money during a financial crisis -- is to be seen.
He talks about 1998 and 2008 and since bitcoin was invented in 2009, he is taking a wait and see - selling the idea that people will lose confidence in bitcoin if there's any kind of crisis.
I think that if he could hear himself, from a bitcoiners point of view - it would be that in a financial crisis, the banks are going to run the presses and dollars, euros and yen are going to have a higher money supply and therefore be able to purchase less, or stock prices will go still higher like they have been, if the wealthy get the money and not the working class.
Anyway, if you have bitcoin, the price should at least go up as fast as they run the presses.
So ... yeah. See you at the next financial crisis - maybe that will be in 2019? 2022?
bitcoin will, especially if there's a financial crisis, be the best place to be invested, by far.

Yeah I'm the same, I can't live their financial life for them, and if it ends in tears and ruins, I don't want to hurt them.
And they all have their own life to live and their own choices to make and understand without another person making suggestions.
I'll just put it out there that a fiduciary should have their best financial interests at heart. The flipside of this though is that common advice is to diversify into foreign and domestic stocks, bonds, etc. If you then go and get into a nice 401k at work where some big fund patronizingly deals with all the details on your behalf, you are going to find that they're going to buy some crazy ass bonds. Someday, when those fail to earn anything, you'll find out that basically the System helped you bail out some banks, the bondholders, and some terribly run governments and corporations, leaving you without that income. Ugh. 
So anyway, I *would* recommend that anyone put about 1% of net worth into crypto. Nothing you need to live on, but it might perform really really well. I can't say what mix of bitcoin to others you should do. I would just say that you should have some of every coin you think is interesting*.
*If you take the precaution of a different virtual machine at least, for each other weird ass coin and wallet. If you keep downloading wallets and miners for odd ass coins, eventually you are going to get your ass hacked and lose possibly everything - even other coins, like your bitcoin.

Listen to the Authority citizen. When they decide its okay to tap into your brain's deepest thoughts to find Thoughtcrime:
“The reason we are able, as part of our basic social compact, to  guarantee individuals a certain zone of privacy is precisely because the  public has reserved the right to access that zone when public safety  requires. If the public’s right of access is blocked, then these zones  of personal privacy are converted into 'law-free zones' insulated from  legitimate scrutiny.”
Once it's possible to access your private thoughts, we can't have your mind become a law-free zone.

No, things that make bitcoin harder to turn back into cash just make bitcoin price rise.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:03:00
I know this is a super weird conjecture --
I think it helps affect the price in three ways:
1) it makes bitcoin much more valuable for payments, remittances, and as a currency - a good effect that makes people want to buy it, that raises price
1b) it also takes some value out of altcoins that right now are addressing that "defect" of bitcoin. ("Defect" because, well you know, that's subjective) - so if LN gets going, then that helps bitcoin claim back value from coins that say they have faster confirmations. Whatever.
2) okay so next, 
((((.. You know what, maybe I am 100% wrong.  Now I'm not sure. I just have a belief that if the Velocity of money is high, that that cuts the value of bitcoin. But maybe I have it backwards. I could have sworn that increasing the Velocity of money lowers the demand for it, which lowers the price of it. ))))
 
I'm just going to handwave this and say that crude monetarism thinks that increasing the velocity of money makes the units of money like dollars go down in value. Just like if you moved the decimal place on dollars in circulation and increased the amount of money out there also made dollars go down in value. -- I think.
So the criticism of that, maybe Mises or someone, would say that ain't how it works.
Well, so now we have bitcoin! :) And we get to find out.

I suspect that it will lower the price to buy bitcoin.
See what happened to gold:
What really might happen is that bitcoin in the ETF (where it's double the price) might just come down to actual market price (what we think it is).
So the other possibility is no net effect on price.
Yet another possibility is that having a futures market will let all the haters come and short bitcoin.
Then, suddenly, bitcoin will lurch upwards like a rocket, flash crash, bankrupt the shorters, and disrupt the futures exchange to such a huge degree that it ruins other futures markets by bankrupting the exchange. Ahhh fuck :) 
Whatever happens, we don't have a crystal ball, but people are effectively placing bets by being in or out. I would say don't be all in bitcoin and don't be all out.

Bitcoin is definitely not the only thing that will come into your life and go up 1000x in value. Spotting things that can go up 10-100x in value is like an annual thing once your eyes are open. But the opportunities are not very big. Like a $10 thing that can become $100, that happens, just you lack the information to spot it when you see it, or the perspective. Just relax, all will be well. Keep an open and critical mind.

Nassim Taleb is just so amazing and wise. I loved his book the Black Swan. Even if he came out and said "bitcoin sucks", he is too wise to ignore.
To me, bitcoin is just one thing he could have an opinion on. For 99% of the things out there, he would know what's what. The main idea is that survivor bias and confirmation bias and the probably of being 100% into one big thing that suddenly blows up on you - that's what is the undoing of most traders. And "black swans" - the thing not in your model, the thing you never expected that tanks you and undoes all of your efforts.

I also always try to buy from walls in bitcoin. Walls represent resistance. I love the idea of putting whales and shorters on the wrong side of gains.
Walls above (resistance) and walls below (support) act to keep prices in a channel. Once walls are broken through, then you have a breakout upwards or a break downwards.
Then prices find a new channel to trade in. Maybe between walls, or maybe between robust more subtle support and resistance.

Eh, he's not quite right. There's crypto involved and LN is cryptographically strong-ish maybe not proven either way yet, but should be able to lean onto bitcoin. And therefore is like a gold certificate made of gold or something odd like that. Analogies don't hold.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:10:24


I'm trying to parse this. 
Are you asking - how is it fair that a channel opens and closes with the same (sum) total of bitcoin? Well, in the end, one side or the other has either all the coins, or a fraction of them.  There's no waste. One side or the other pays the fee to close the channel. Probably the guy playing the transaction? Not sure. Depends on what you set up originally.
And ... "saving is not lending" - I think this part of your question or statement is saying something like:  "doing this is not free, how do I get paid or benefit?" 
The get paid part: you can charge a little for people to take your routes through. So someone paying through your partner, you could advertise that your route charges people a bit. So if they *really* want to, they could use you and it will cost them, but maybe actually you might set a fee in one direction but not the other. Eg, you prefer to have fees if most transactions are going one direction through you, and the effect of that is that it's basically put all your bitcoin to one side or the other, and making it so you have this open channel, and you're wondering if you should just put the transaction to the blockchain and settle. But if you do, you have to pay a real fee in bitcoin. Ugh. So you might have it be fees in some directions, but no fee to go back the other way, or anything that drives the balance back to the middle? I'm not sure if this is needed or even possible, to have asymmetry of fees.
So then, next, not how you make money off this, but how is this a benefit to you?  This builds a valuable Proof of Stake layer on top of bitcoin. If you were ever wondering why the heck you should have something like 1 bitcoin out there as a "contract" on the blockchain, and what the heck that means in terms of risk (what if this explodes and you lose your bitcoin?!?!?), and what that means in terms of benefit (1 bitcoin at stake might be enough to be a BANK man, an ENTIRE BANK - well a bank branch at least :) ).
Eg, this fixes the scaling issue, routes payments, defeats VISA, and makes you mind-bogglingly rich.  If that's your thing.
Big companies that take lots of payments like Starbucks, could need on the order of ~100 of these payment channels. Maybe more. Maybe one per customer, maybe one per customer's bank. Whatever. Or really their payment processors would have that for them, but same idea.

Wall Street has a lot of good investments, and I would say that most people should have at 1% to 5% punt on cryptos. But have maybe 30% of net worth in surplus home value, and 66-69% in stocks on Wall Street - ideally an index fund. Go Vanguard!

yeah the shorts and long bets, in dollars, those are matched. But no one actually has to get or use any bitcoin. 
So it kind of sucks. It helps me understand though why gold futures didn't make the price of gold go up up up. 
What's happening is kind of like if you had two pals, not into bitcoin at all, but one betting it goes up the other betting it goes down. And they're betting in dollars. Neither might know anything about bitcoin though.
This just makes a market out of those people. This is good for some participants in bitcoin, like it sounds good for the miners who have to produce bitcoin and don't want to risk losses.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:56:46
Well, I have to say, the major thing you're doing right - with bitcoin - right at the beginning - you have to choose to be anonymous OR NOT. 
Now that you've gone the ATM route, I would stick with ATM  / localbitcoin type situations.
Your coins arent' 100% anonymous - mined coins come closest - but that premium you paid (30%?) - is also a premium someone else might pay for that level of privacy.
So, from me, I think you did good.
I went the other way and did not buy anonymously ... but that's cool, I knew what I was getting into ...

Now I have to ask :/
Is blockchain.info following this bitcoin, or is it following bitcoin cash (bcash)?
 
also separate technical question
You know how bitcoin addresses have a checksum, can something like that, maybe it has to be new - be used to make sure it's super clear which bitcoin chain I'm sending to?
I get that the answer is "no" because they're both trying to be  "the" bitcoin. But is there some way to be absolutely positive which blockchain I'm sending stuff to, does it depend only on the network of nodes and me just magically knowing?
Am I basically forced now to use a full node to make sure it goes to the right chain? I'm not sure how I could be more sure I'm on the right one.

oh sorry, didn't mean to be a jerk to you; 
But yeah it's disappointing that fees are so high relative to what miners could get from the coinbase transaction. 
I was expecting today's situation where fees are greater than the block reward to be something that happened way out in the year 2100+ 
But it turns out that no one thought to target fees over time to converge onto some ideal amount as a percentage of the block. So, here we are.
I don't think it's completely moot to have bitcoin. Not being able to send money cheaply is very disappointing for me. But being able to do it without permission is still important.

If it's your money, and it's only play money, I recommend the opposite. Respect your dad but make your own choices, and live with the consequences. Don't go overboard on bitcoin stuff, like don't get crazy with it, but a punt on something interesting is still worthwhile.
Be sure to keep your eyes open for other good opportunities in life, because bitcoin is not the only possible thing out there (I don't mean altcoins) --
Sometimes life randomly gives just you a chance at something big, could be a good job, a great idea, a patented invention, or something, and those opportunities and those gifts you should be sure to keep on the look out for.
Bitcoin is definitely not the last great thing to come, and if you keep your eyes open, you will see good opportunities every so often. Make good choices, take strategic risks, don't ignore the chance of unlikely things sinking the ship.

$2.2 billion dollar fund, 1/2 in bitcoin. Implies $1.1 billion in bitcoin. Assuming he bought late (if he bought earlier, the numbers would be even more ridiculous ...) -- then he paid $10k / bitcoin.
That's 100,000 bitcoins. Who has that besides maybe Draper?  
I find this really unlikely.
10,000 bitcoin is possible, if slowly slowly slowly accumulated, and if they painted the tape with large dumps to get people to sell. But I don't really believe that it's gone the other direction.
UNLESS he set up a fund that nominally has that much in bitcoins, but only because he's running a fund for someone else. Early adopters like Brian Armstrong of Coinbase had (still have?) ~50,000 coins.

I think you're right -- example:
"In the case of the NYMEX WTI contract, physical delivery is possible and entails delivery into the oil hub of Cushing, Oklahoma. ... In reality, very rarely does physical delivery take place in commodity futures."
I think that every future, in the end, IS actually delivered for things like oil.
Just that if you really don't want to baghold it, you might have to sell it at a loss to someone who does want the actual oil, and is ready to take it off your hands. Otherwise, like a game of musical chairs, the music stops and the actual thing is delivered to the last person holding the future ;)
I think that a given future is counting down to it's delivery date though, and might pass back and forth between many hands, before the actual receiver gets it. They could buy the future and hold onto it all the way to the end obviously, but speculators might pass them around. One of those speculators could get unlucky and baghold it. I think that Keynes himself speculated on wheat futures and at one point was going to have to find a warehouse to hold 1 year of Englands grain production, lol.

Welll .... technically LN could fix the scaling problem but kill bitcoin's value ! :)
It increases the velocity of money, which is something that you divide by. So as the number of times you can move money around goes up, the price of a unit of bitcoin goes down.
But other than that, YEP we do not have a crystal ball.
And I'm basically in favor of bitcoin having a good high velocity, because a better currency has that property. So let's not be afraid.  That sets store of value up against utility as a currency, but either way, I am happy.
I do think that the fees are a bit high; on a percentage basis, for what you're getting, I think they're great. It's like "oh no, my 20 bitcoin lambo just cost me .0001 bitcoin" -- but in an absolute sense, bitcoin transactions are not going through by the price of the bitcoin, but by cost in byte. So that's weird for people. They're getting fees that are .0001 bitcoin or something (or higher?) for tiny purchases. Okay, they should take their tiny purchases and go elsewhere. But what about sweeps of many inputs to one output to consolidate? There's got to be a better way to do this.

Eh, Economists compensate by taking on meanings for words that are outrageously precise. That way they can't be wrong. Example would be ordinary terms like price/cost/value, labor/capital, etc. To you and me those look like ordinary English words but they mean something much more precise to an economist. It would be like as if chemists took ordinary words like "air" and "pollution" but should have found new words like "oxygen" and "nitrous oxide". Then they take these ordinary English words and moosh out nonsense, and then blame the rest of us for not understanding them.

Thanks for making me look that up:
The Warburg hypothesis (/ˈvɑːrbʊərɡ/), sometimes known as the Warburg theory of cancer, postulates that the driver of tumorigenesis is an insufficient cellular respiration caused by insult to mitochondria. ... In other words, instead of fully respiring in the presence of adequate oxygen, cancer cells ferment.
Do cancer cells thrive on oxygen?
Increasing Cellular Oxygen Can Kill Cancerous Cells. The link between oxygen and cancer is clear. In fact, an underlying cause of cancer is usually low cellular oxygenation levels. In newly formed cells, low levels of oxygen damage respiration enzymes so that the cells cannot produce energy using oxygen.

I'm not sure, exponential functions like this are hard to guess, 
I was surprised by today's surging FOMO volume on Coinbase and GDAX.
I don't see why bitcoin couldn't surge to $120k, then make a long depressing slide back down to $30k. 
Or hit $20k, then slide all the way back down to $5k. 
The spikes can be really sharp and fast, and the unwinding off that downwards can take years to settle down. You have to lose hope first.

EDIT: I don't mean "you" personally - I meant, could Eve run a LN node and spy on people? And I've come to understand that in the LN, the node knows the node the payment is coming in from, and which node it's going out to, and it sounds like the direction of that payment travel is chosen by the payer - and is not revealed - and that's good, sounds like TOR.
BUT is the message in the payment confidential or not, is it still the same broken pseudonymity of bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a different form of "fiat". 
It's not fiat in that it's not declared by a sovereign to be valuable, and I don't know of anywhere you could pay your taxes in it directly. But it's also not a tangible "hold-it-in-your-hands" thing like a lump of gold.
It's more of a very hard to earn, but easy to trade, digital commodity with a notional market value, and some interesting properties (like smart contracts), accepted by a pretty good number of people.

Well that's how they see it, but they conveniently ignore the obvious malinvestments ... 
I get their argument, I see their side. They're just trapped. They're trying to have full employment (4% unemployment, close enough), and low interest rates to encourage businesses and invesments. 
And I LOVE some of the companies that needed cheap access to capital to pay off (solar farms, stuff like that). But dang, there is also bad businesses out there, and mom and pops trying to guess which investment to be in (should be in indexed funds) and I am not sure.
In the meantime, into bitcoin as a hedge. Also, invested in S&amp;P500
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:04:14
Sure what people do is string out nets to catch coins at falling prices.
The ideal curve for buying and selling looks like a 45 degree angle on the buying side, and looks like a logarithmic curve going up and away to the right on the selling side. Not sure why that is, just something I've noticed over the years. Some math is behind it.
If I wanted to do this, I would sling nets between $8000 and $11600, about every $100 as little buys in case bitcoin moves down. Check out for some more ideas
So if you're buying, you want to fill in the odd spots on that curve up and away to the left where it's accidentally got some pits and stops, usually right in front of slight walls on the way "down" in price.

If they're on Coinbase they can throw back and forth to each other with no fees, there's a "receive" option.
Other than that, yeah fees. 
You can have a personal wallet on a cell phone.
In other countries like Kenya, they use mPesa instead of bitcoin, which started off as a way of trading or giving away mobile phone minutes, but became a currency, and is now tied to the Kenyan shilling. 
When people REALLY need a money, they find something. Money will have certain properties.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:15:01
The fees are nice, and it would probably be a good idea to set a fee target for blocksize, like 10% of the coinbase reward. If the fees are too low in 2 weeks of payoff, shrink the block. If the fees are too high, make the blocks bigger.

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:40:35
Yeah the miners could do that, and keep raising the fees, which then other pools are collecting, unless they all do that, then "real" transactions have to pay the fees that all the miners want. 
Then ... in my suggestion the blocksize would get bigger and fees would fall back down. Then the miners would stuff the fees (effectively paying themselves). And blocks would grow in my system until the miners were like "oh oops" - because the first miner to stop with that stupidity starts collecting good sized fees.
It just turns blocksize storage within a time limit (like the 24 hour, or 6 block confirmation, or some other limit) into a new thing with a price. If blocksizes can't flex, then I think that it's much more gameable.

Gresham's Law, bad money drives out good, a variation on it.
Basically, if you have cash, you spend that instead and keep your bitcoin. Or if you spend bitcoin, you have to rebuy (or else you're selling bitcoin). People on the whole would rather keep bitcoin than spend it, the supply can't keep up, bitcoin prices go up..
Add in some US tax interpretations that makes buying and spending a taxation tracking problem and you're not as able to use bitcoin as a currency. 
It could be more like a currency if we did like Japan or Germany and treated it as a unit of account / currency of it's own.
Then add the problem that a rising bitcoin with a fee system that rises with it (limited space in a block), means that one day its $1000 bitcoin and 5 cent fees and then next year its million dollar bitcoin and $10k fees. Argh. :)

The "Evil maid" attack, performed by a friend, repairman, relative, etc, that's how you would lose your coins. It all completely depends on how they attack it. They need physical access, and they need to catch you in the middle of using the system, like they did Dread Pirate Roberts. Not easy to do, but not impossible.
You can use some other way to encrypt things, but the 12 or 24 seed word thing is going to be understood by more people, for better or worse.

There's what he personally bought, then what this fund has, and there are different periods of time when one or the other had different amounts in them, AND with the price movements, and no real knowledge of any trades after purchase or these points in time, it's nearly impossible to guess wth is going on with these numbers.
I'd say he probably has ~8500 coins in the hedge fund
"In late October, The Wall Street Journal reported that Miller's fund had nearly a third in bitcoin and about $154 million in assets under management. At the time, the digital currency was trading near $6,000. Bitcoin has since more than tripled to above $19,000 as investor interest has grown."

Track a little bit of maybe 8 coins that you think are interesting.
When theyre all down in the red, buy a little.
When theyre all green, see if pulling out a few thousand dollars worth is good timing. If not let it crash/slump again and buy more later.
Todays a good day for buying because all prices are down. Not a good day for selling.

I agree with what you're saying, at some point you have to take something intangible like bitcoin, and ideally transform it into something that can't be extracted from you - like a business education - and then you can grow and grow. Real "wealth" takes real effort.
It's nice to have the resources of bitcoin to buy things with, but what can you *buy* that will really help you. Or help you advance your goals. What are your goals? Etc.

Instead of focusing on the dollar cost as a yard stick, why not focus on the amount of bitcoin you're accumulating? It's looking likely that things like Lightning Network will add something like a proof of stake layer, indirectly, by requiring a fair-sized sum of bitcoin to open the channel and be useful. So if you can get about a 1/10th of a bitcoin or more, you should be set.

Well, speaking just for me; 
I had good experiences with professors in college and I had bad ones. Some were amazing knowledgeable, confident, knew the limits of what they knew (my Science profs mostly).
The Math prof I ran into that thought that computers could not possibly work symbolically in mathematics, boy that was painful.  He was convinced that because computers were all ones and zeros, that they could never really do algebra. They couldn't "know" what 1/3rd was, that a computer would think it was .333333333333 or something. Boy that guy was daft.
Anyway, in a better future world, where deflationary money takes hold, people that KNOW something, and really know it, inside and out, those people will be very very valuable. And hopefully we can have real scholarship again, with less doofy college administrators leeching off the top, uselessly.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:48:58
What a great article, I basically agree.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:01:59
Oh that page?
Oh it's making up ideas like - what if some goldbugs, currently into gold, sold their gold and bought bitcoin, like 1%? Move the slider to 1%. 
What if people sending money to Mexico, the Philippines, or anywhere, what if 1/2 that market went to bitcoin? Move that slider to 50%.
The more that bitcoin gets used for these different purposes, the more bitcoin would eat their lunch.
Given the supply of bitcoin, then you get a target price for what it might do.
I sometimes wonder if the model is wrong, like if removing a little supply makes bitcoin go crazy upwards. But its seems like as bitcoin gains value it overshoots - spikes way way up - then plummets, spiking way way down - constantly looking for resistance - and no one wants to sell when it's rising - or support - no one wants to catch a falling knife and buy when it's falling.  From that point of view, they might be underestimating the network effect of bitcoin, but remittances kind of captures the idea (badly).
Clearly, another part of the model that's wrong is that altcoins exist. They really swung into action. At the time that page was made I think the altcoins that maybe mattered were Ripple, Litecoin, and weird stuff like Quark or Counterparty? Not sure. It was a while ago. No one then was really worried about altcoins. I don't think Ethereum existed then. Ethereum is like the coin for brainy people that were late to the party.

That paper would imply that it would allow big financial groups to drive down the price of bitcoin.
To me, that just means that people who want actual bitcoin will be paying less.
I just don't think that, unlike pork bellies, or frozen concentrated orange juice, where a producer and a consumer of those things (to raise hogs, butcher, provide pork bellies, so that someone else can make bacon, or to grow oranges, harvest and pulp it, then sell so that someone else can make orange juice)  - there a middle man or market for the commodity makes a lot of sense.
But for bitcoin there are sellers and there are buyers and I don't really see why we need these middlemen. BUT this might actually be a helpful step because once you have a middleman, this helps you sharpen the mind about how you can cut them out, and/or become one yourself at get your own cut of the profits..

I'm not Coinbase support but I might be able to explain how it works.
Which money do you mean by the way? Do you mean from your bank, into Coinbase, and giving you dollars to spend,
Or did you mean bitcoin, ethereum or litecoin you bought and are waiting to see "be there" in your balance?
The balances should be in your dashboard and on the right hand side should be the status. When you're first starting off, the limits are low, and things like bitcoin take "days" to arrive because really, they are waiting for ACH (the old checking system) to settle the funds.

It doesn't dissolve away very quickly, it's somewhat scarce, and people think it's valuable cross-culturally, and have for centuries.
(I think bitcoin is a bit better money for a modern Internet-connected age, but gold is kind of neat, and I can see why it became money. - Platinum or silver seem like they would have been a more likely money than gold to me, but gold's pretty portable. It's more of a stretch to see why Rai stones became money, but that's an interesting story by itself.)

I'm down to chat Lambos with you. 
Have you seen the prices on Lamborghini parts? It's like embarrassing. Say you blow the E-line on the transmission in your Gallardo, that's like .5 a bitcoin to get a replacement for the pack of 5 transmission lines. But you don't need all 5, you only need that 1. But if you chat with Lamborghini of Dallas (they dont take bitcoin? do they take bitcoin?) you can get just the one transmission line you need overnighted to you for like .25 bitcoin. An oil change is going to cost you freaking .05 bitcoin.
I'm personally not going to pay 20 bitcoin for a Gallardo, I'm holding out for 1 Lambo = 1 BTC. (I don't know what the entry level 2022 model will be though). The *ad personam* program is nice though, I'm either thinking all black gloss, carbon black, or maybe cherry red matte, verde mantis color is cool though.

One layer of practical use is to send money around and maybe be able to do some smart money contracts and to embed a little bit of data, like hashes and timestamps, into a system that's hard to censor.
So a lot of the value comes from the network effect, being so big and being first. 
Some of the value of altcoins are getting their value from the authors being able to personally enrich themselves to a degree off the altcoin that they never could in bitcoin. Bitcoin is also hard to change, so if you have some ideas, it can be easier to start with a fresh cryptocurrency. Next, you can derive a lot of value for an altcoin from fixing a bitcoin defect. You can make more interesting contracts in Ethereum, you can have a more private money with Monero. Then there's piles of semi-scammy coins, or total scams (Bitconnect sounds like a scam). 
Bitcoin's main practical use is that if you HAD TO get someone some money to the other side of the world, they could tweet an address, and you could send them some.
Bitcoin has defects - there could be repurcussions to you if the powers that be want to come crucify you and make an example out of you. But yeah, basically you can do what you want.

I agree, because I don't see why every scammer or 'entrepreneurial' 'visionary' dev wouldn't make their own altcoin, token, or ERC-whatever token - that way they can scam the F out of people and do nothing, whereas this like actually makes them not be as scammy, for a whole lot of work.
I mean you could have a non-scam altcoin or ERC token, for sure, and those would have to be an order of magnitude less hassle for them .

@_date: 2017-12-05 17:23:00
Well, I humbly suggest that he is not right.
You can store the string "1/3" and if you need to know it's decimal aspect, you can calculate that as 0.333333333 and for repeating decimals, you could choose to hold that internally as another aspect of 9ths. Example, if something is .222222 forever, that's really 2/9ths. You could tag the object as a "repeating decimal" and have the computer know that interesting aspect of your object.
It might be hard to have a computer notice new previously unknown things and tag them as "interesting" and/or find practical applications. And it might be hard to have it notice things without a brute force search for interesting things. Eg could a sufficiently well programmed maths computer independently "discover" *i*?
EDIT: You and I probably both read Godel Escher Bach, but maybe came to slightly different conclusions? My take was that computers could become string pushing machines, and do things like take a string in mathematical notation and using rules or heuristics "solve" problems with those rules pretty well, probably well enough to do undergraduate college mathematics at least. Maybe not top end maths, because of Godels theorem.
An example would be, you could have a computer running two different programs. One of them is feeding input to "calculator" and the other one is a more subtle program like I'm envisioning. Same computer though.
One of them is fed the string "3/9=" and returns "0.33333333" and another better one returns "1/3"

Their banking system is closed. You cant arbitrage it easily. Their currency is actually strong because of exports. bitcoin is balancing it out.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:20:02
Look dude, sometimes I'm on mobile so I don't have time to explain as fully as I'd like.
Starting over:
If you have gold in a bank, and they issue a gold-backed certificate, then bank robbers could come and steal all the gold and all you have, the certificate, is paper.
If you have bitcoin, then you actually have secret keys that let you sign messages on the blockchain to move values of bitcoin around. 
If you are in a LN channel with someone, you are passing back and forth signed messages that show balances moving around but are not yet played to the network. If a participant falls off the map and stops participating, you can play a signed bitcoin message to the bitcoin blockchain that will work out in your favor. 
Like, say you have a channel with a bitcoin LN "bank" and you're paying them and sometimes they pay you. You pay when you want to buy things, and you get paid when other people pay a salary to you. If the LN bitcoin "bank" goes belly up, just ceases to exist entirely, you can always play to the network the last transaction that you got that you like. That would be the one where you got paid your salary, but not the one where you paid for one last item. That preserved your balance of bitcoin. 
LN is cryptographically strong, but it's new too, so there are some risks. Hindsight will be 20/20 and after LN is widely deployed, there could be a problem somewhere with LN, but that's the chance you take with new technologies.

The fees don't matter. They're just a basic charge for the storage space to prevent spam.
The miners are being paid by the coinbase (the mining reward).
It is an inflationary subsidy to miners paid for by holders that are speculating on the future value of their disinflationary money system (inflating, but the rate of inflation is decreasing in the future).
The miners don't have to mine bitcoin or do anything, but it's assumed that they either want their own bitcoin and most especially, it is assumed that they have a source of cheap electricity and fast mining hardware.

Yeah if you make a breakout, some people are only looking at candle charts and they are like "what happen?!?!?" and are too late. They always think its 'news' or something 
I am watching that same sell wall at 18,000 -- I figure thats an 2013 bitcoiner who is like, "$17 mil?" and pulled the rip cord. :) Now the coins will go to safe hands
Also, could be a VERY large wall from a whale that absolutely positively MUST NOT have their bitcoin shorts stopped out

On the left side, is people waiting to buy more passively. They have some purchases set up in case someone wants to dump coins. Those coins represent mild bull interest, and are more passive. They are "support".
As you slide your cursor over them, you can find out how much bitcoin is waiting to be bought and how much dollars that represents. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:25:55


I'll buy as many bitcoins as you're selling for  $1.16 each; we can do this deal OTC so we won't move the market much, very little slippage; just PM me, I have $1.1k dollars just waiting to get in, so I can buy about 900 I figure; just keep it on the down low. Soon we'll have small remote control Lambos for mice! I promise this is legit, $1.16 per bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:33:44
Cause people are idiots and see the amount of dollars their bitcoin is worth going up, and buying into the dumb nonsense that LN will save everything.
They haven't come around to the idea that fees need to be in dollar terms very small, and that means that fees need to get exponentially smaller over time (Because bitcoins are getting more rare) - and if the fees are too high relative to the coins minted, then the blocks should get bigger until fees fall again.
Also, there's no reward at all for being a node, and that should have some kind of reward, but that's tricky to do because what "work" are they doing? But it would have been helpful if nodes were funding with either a full bitcoin a year, or a 1/10th of a bitcoin, or some number, then you could do the math and figure out how much disk, network, etc, a node needs or should have. If nodes were a full bitcoin, a $17k node would put paid to the fucking whining about disk space of the blockchain.
But being the first cryptocurrency, this and other problems are things the creator didn't anticipate.
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:08:00
Yeah because nodes don't get any bitcoin for bothering to be a node.
It's kind of a small flaw imho.
Also, datacenter network speeds improve WAY faster than home users. Of course that depends on the country, in Sweden you'd be fine, but in USA our networks still suck.

@_date: 2017-12-24 03:25:14
How about whenever the fees exceed half or a quarter of the value of the coinbase, then increase the blocksize, dynamically, or decrease it, every two weeks.
Probably have the fees as a proportion go DOWN relative to the coinbase over time, because bitcoin is getting more scarce fast, but the fees need to stay low to stay relevant.

Hmm, well but you know there are simple concepts of infinity, which we could implement as the symbol "∞" and then we can write some Calculus with that symbol or some other symbol -- (we have to figure out how to "encode" mathematical statements into something we can type.)
But once those statements are encoded into a string of some form, a computer could use rules or heuristics to try to make progress.
Like this page - 
I'm not arguing though that very very top end Mathematics could be done this way, because Godels theorem says it can't be done - I think. Doesn't the theorem say something like no axiomatic system can ever be proven by a set of its own axioms? Paraphrasing?
But I think undergrad Calculus level problems could truly be solved by a computer, with some symbol pushing.
And if you press it for answers like: graph this, if x = 0 then what is y? and things like that might be done by some sub-solvers of their own that take encoded mathematical expressions that are already in their simplest form (an interesting problem to try and guarantee), and then spit that into their own solvers, which are like seeing the information from another point of view. Graphing x=y, and the equation as written, "x=y" are literally just two different ways of expressing the same idea.
Well I don't know, I am ... of okay level intelligence. I just think it's maybe possible. Lack the time right now with a job and school to put in the effort to make a demonstration of what I mean.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:38:45


Yeah I do like Coinbase, but you're right. It's still a central place and I feel that a lot of bitcoins could go down with it. Even them, their business is so big and complex, there's no way that somewhere it doesn't have a fatal flaw. If I had to guess, the most likely would probably be having the cold wallet itself just be borked, unrecoverable, gg game over.
Part of the risk of having a third party control your bitcoin is just that kind of super stupid mistake.
Another risk seems to be an RSA data breach type vulnerability where an APT (Advanced persistent threat - like Project Aurora or Stuxnet) gets in and slowly reams them and all their customers.

Well AML/KYC and other forms of blocking people using their money, confiscating their wealth (gold seizure, account banking bail-ins, trying to seize the profits of criminal enterprise, court-ordered judgements) these are on a spectrum where a person with a neutral point of view might think X is okay but Y is borderline and Z is right out, whereas a given government is mostly just obsessing over whatever they CAN do, and in a digital world of ordinary banking, would love to see the end of cash and the total control and surveillance of everyone and everything, with the largest possible sovereign reach.
Also, there is just a massive cop out on the part of government to do anything active to really stop certain world developments or criminal enterprises.
Sometimes its because actions like "putting warheads on foreheads" would just lead to outright war like US vs Iran, and sanctions are easier.
Sometimes it's because strangely the government can't make a case against someone like Al Capone for something straightforward like murder, but could get him on tax evasion.
EDIT: and of course I forgot Civil Asset Forfeiture which is a whole awful can of worms where the cops are incentivized to steal your stuff.
Or like Silk Road, where seizing bitcoin or the person operating it turned out to be easier than going after or going through the postal system. Ordering the materials and tracing the origin back to suppliers of drugs.
The banking system is a part of the power elite's structure and it serves the elites interests. It is the elite, it does their will too. It tries to find ways to make itself relevant. If all bankers did was cash checks, wire money, and make change for $20 bills, and ask no questions other than confirming some mutual secret to establish account ownership, they would not be very relevant in the power structures today.
Meh, I hope someday we get banking secrecy back, but it's going to take time. Maybe 40 years.
We will probably get there by eliminating the functions of banks where they get in people's way, and keeping the parts where they are going to stick around, like making business loans and financing large projects.

Cash/USD/checking clearing, those don't actually settle very fast. 
The other way around, if you send bitcoin out to an address and it gets confirmed in a block? Then you are in a pickle, as there are no take backs on bitcoin. (But that's part of what makes bitcoin great).

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:27:37
Maybe. You could use a quick heuristic to think about breakouts --
First, the ones doing the breakout upwards, those are bulls in the traditional sense. They are active buyers, and once they buy, that money is gone (converted to bitcoin!)  :)  (They could always become sellers, obviously, at some future time, or in moments)
Behind those active bulls are more passive bulls, that are supporters. They want cheap coins. They have money on the left side, up that hill up and away back to the left. 
What I do is I look at any support walls about near the middle of the left green side. Right at that point, I look at the money involved. Maybe its $123 million US until you reach a little support wall at $8k per bitcoin, and they're willing to buy like 100. So there's a small support wall, and it's right near the middle. So now you know that there's that much passive money waiting to buy if the price is right. And they're in front of that mini wall, so they're pretty interested. If they were behind that mini wall, they're using the wall as insurance for really cheap coins in case of a dramatic fall in price.
Then I take that more passive - but interested - amount of money $123 billion, and I move my cursor over the resistance and I try to see how much that would buy (buying resistance is really firm, the two sides might look kind of symmetrical, but it's a real overhang, a weight, as you go to the right).
So if that $123 million clears the resistance wall, I look to where that would stop. If it's way way past it, then you might spark momentum ignition (where shorts get popped) and then get a crazy breakout. 
So that's my thought process :) 
might have ideas.
Caveat: trading is not for me, too much documentation for taxes, and too high a chance of losses. I got lucky. If I'd known that bitcoin was going to be such a success, I wouldn't have taken the risk of trading.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:09:27

World Bitcoin Network has a sliders page, and if you move the sliders to how much of value in gold, remittances etc, bitcoin can take, you get some number around $140k
To the degree that that looks plausible, that future value is reflected in the current price, which today is around $17k a bitcoin.

I know how you feel, but consider another point of view.. Instead of dollars and bitcoin, pretend it was metals like platinum and nickel. 
Pretend a government simply said, this coin of platinum is worth this much in taxes (a face value, higher than the value of the metal), and starting off the nickel had a face value, also higher than the value of the metal inside. 
So you think, that's cool. And start using it like a currency. Have to anyway, because taxes are paid. Can be paid in either coin.
Then, these metals that they're made of BOTH start to become kind of rare. The face value and the metal value are nearly the same, and for long enough that people think platinum is scarce and valuable, and that nickel is common and worth a nickel in buying power. 
Okay, then one day, there's a private project to go mine asteroids for platinum. Predictions are platinum will be common.
Now you start to rethink things a little. Maybe you should hold nickel. You're really not sure.
So from then on, you are speculating on the face values, and the base metal values. 
You started off going 10% nickel, at a time when most people were seeing steady value in platinum and having ONLY platinum. 
Not your fault, the asteroid mining works, and the value of platinum crashes, your microscopic nickel hoard is now worth a TON, no one is spending nickels, they are spending fractions of platinum instead.
It's all weird, and it's a long convoluted example of Gresham's Law. Bad money drives out good, meaning. If there are two monies, and one of them is common or bad, and the other is worth holding onto scarce and becoming more scarce, people will take the good money out of circulation and hoard it. It doesn't mean it's worthless, it means the opposite. It means it's the GOOD money.
Bitcoin is good money relative to dollars, euros and yen, and that's what's happening.
Once bitcoin starts to be in the same sentence as the Swiss Franc, I think we've won.

Ah yes, true. Hmm maybe the "mixers" of the future are just an LN node in a strange place that  you have some reason to trust.
You know how IP packets now currently get routed around, and that just happens .... once upon a time in the Internet, I could swear it was possible to put into your packet the route you wanted it to take. Hmm. 
Well maybe just encrypting the payload, analogous to the way IPsec's ESP does, compared to IPsec AH, that might be the way.
If LN could send, or does it? Just like TOR? like, does it preserve confidentiality? Does each node in the middle *ONLY* know who they got it from, and who it's going to?

I'm positive that there's a bitcointalk discussion about this.
I'm also pretty sure that there was an actual Satoshi quote about the issue. Without handwaving it too much, you can either add to bitcoin and test lots of code and subdivide a satoshi, or do it off-chain in another layer.

I'm not the guy you're replying to, but the idea is that the Greater Fool theory is that sometimes people buy because other people are buying, chasing the price upwards in speculation of selling it for more later, to a Greater Fool.
Me personally, I have a different theory about bitcoin. I know this sounds wacky, but - I think that bitcoin is 1) harder to use than most technologies - which slows the rate at which it can grow 2) is not a company, so it grows mainly by word of mouth, trying things out, and speculative buzz
Both of those things slow things down. That means that bitcoin price has gone from zero to this number, and ...
One idea is that the current spot price is the best predictor of the future price.
Another idea is that the future price is so mind-bogglingly high that people don't dare to believe it. 
I know I got in, and I put a fair amount into bitcoin - but if I had known ;_; -- I would NOT have gone to college, I would have borrowed everything I could, I would have quit my job to rollover into a self-directed IRA to buy bitcoin, I would have moved heaven and fucking earth.
Balance that though with reality. Hindsight is 20/20, and I think there was a non-zero chance of total failure or wipeout on the way from then to now - and into the future.
AND the chance of it suddenly collapsing to zero in value/price - that's not 0% - but is it 1%? 10%? 99%? 100%?
No one knows. 
Is this a new asset class or is this a bubble? (both? yes? lol!)

@_date: 2017-12-24 02:10:21
I am, well it's a distributed currency, has distributed consensus. If it can't reach consensus, then people use coins that work the way they like, for better or worse.
I personally have a blind spot when it came to thinking of bitcoin as a smart contract system.
But I could see that there is clearly a problem in the privacy/fungibility/chain analysis, and there's a problem in the fees versus the value being transacted - maybe impossible to solve because there's no Oracle to tell bitcoin "hey, your fees are too high". Also, there's no obvious way to have a target number of free nodes. Like some reward for having or being a node. Oh well. 
Bitcoin came first, and has issues. Into those gaps come other coins.
I still support bitcoin and I think it's great, it just has problems.

I must have a weird different definition than you. Sorry I'm wrong. I think that by definition, you are right and I am wrong.
So I am not sure what to call my odd understanding. Call it something else like string-math instead of "discrete" math? I hate to make up my own terms, as that's an unfair way to argue something.
But I have this other understanding --
Do people store "real mathematical" numbers in their heads or just strings? I think, strings. Then we operate on those and ponder them. How we work out ideas in our visual imagination is probably a different system.
You can have "real" mathematics work on strings and not be continuous. Example --
"(1/3)+(1/4)=" -... and a calculator will say "0.58333333"
"(1/3)+(1/4)=" and a more subtle string processing maths engine would produce "7/12"
and you could flag that object up with different other objective meanings like (a decimal representation is this ..., some common components that are equivalent is this... etc)
This is kind of amazing if you think that computers can only do approximations.
Maybe if I become a bitcoin millionaire I will recode something like Wolfram Alpha but better, but that might have to wait for my maths PhD.

@_date: 2017-12-09 23:41:18
Yes, sort of. Take small punts on interesting ideas and see how they pan out. That's the best way to experiment. Like $100 bitcoin, $100 spending on garage sales, $100 in lendingclub.com, etc. See what happens to your attempts at making money and where it goes. Maybe buy a share of stock at Robinhood or Scottrade or something. Doing this is not going to make you a genius investor or anything but help you see other ways that you can find value out there big or small. My theory is that people have to try different things, then they find something, somewhere.

Well, there's greed, but there's also inertia. It's easier to not move the coins, and the hypothetical of what it could buy starts to feel real, and then you start to corner yourself (quit your job in spite, burn bridges, eg "become the real you") and then if bitcoin crashes hard, start to realize that hopes and dreams are not an investment strategy.
Now me, I am in it for the greed, and for the lulz.

"Custodial risk" is the risk that the broker (Coinbase) just suddenly goes bankrupt from a major hack that they didn't see coming. 
Or something else. It has to be something where you go OMG and /facepalm. But regardless, it takes out the exchange or broker where you had bitcoin stored.
If you are really paranoid (smart?) you are on 5+ exchanges and/or are never committing more than 20% of your bitcoin to any one.
If you really sit down and think "one day, I lose all my bitcoin? how could it happen?" then you see more of these scenarios playing out.

Meh. The miners are checking each other (With nodes) and building on top of the block with most proof of work that obeys the consensus rules. If they want to, they can fork at any time by obeying some new made up rules they want to believe in, but they can't then go and be surprised if no one builds on their block. And if they go too far down that road, they're mining a coin no one wants.

Yeah cryptocurrency energy use is just wherever someone can find some spare base load at low prices.
If somewhere like Venezuela stands around and subsidizes energy consumption they can't really be surprised when people use it. Same when they subsidize gasoline - look at that, people smuggle it out to Columbia.
Maybe the energy producers will switch to solar, or have a mining farm use solar+mine, then wake up one day and instead of replacing the miners, sell the energy. The solar will be good for another 30+ years, and miners are junk in a year.

I like that other logarithmic graph that shows the cycles taking longer and rising slower, so the next cycle is probably 3 years 6 months out, and takes us to $100k+ per bitcoin.
First we have to weather bitcoin falling to $8k or lower though. That's necessary to shake out weak hands. From here bitcoin has to be very disappointing. It can't just go straight to $100k.

Ah okay, so nlock can do this?
Then why does Replace By Fee exist? I think I was imagining that it was a way to unstick a transaction by having it go through with a sweeter fee.
But now, I'm thinking, if I really want a transaction to go through in like the next hour, and it doesn't, why wouldn't I just make a new one and play that one?
I am sure I am missing something. Maybe RBF is for other scenarios.

Dude, bitcoin crashes all the time. Swings of 50% down and 100% up are incredibly normal in bitcoin. This is because no one knows if this is a new asset class, a bubble or what the fuck it is. It has been on a huge upwards trajectory and every 10x it pops, retraces and comes back stronger. It's gone up 10x about 6 times already. And it might have three more 10x runs before it 'pops' back to either half it's value (at about 500x from here) or to ZERO. :)
Enjoy! :)

Some people will want to do that, because their unit of account is dollars. They think they will have more dollars if they sell high.
Other people are bitcoin zealots. They are hitting milestones like "hooray, I have 1 whole bitcoin!"  They are measuring their gains in bitcoin itself, and regretting ever selling any.
A bitcoin zealot has already figured that bitcoin is here to change the world and they want to be a big part of that future world.
They will only spend it if they absolutely have to. On food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or safe passage out of an authoritarian regime or something.
Now they can be shaken, events like "the flippening" and FUD of all kinds can make them want to sell.
Multiyear down values for bitcoin, looming bills, and witch hunts against bitcoiners can all really demoralize them.
But some fluctuations in price?? Pssh. Up 100%, down 50%, the volatility is HILARIOUS. Especially when a lot of them bought in at 1/10th or 1/100th or 1/1000th the current price.

I think a bank that is a Custodian bank is a different thing. Those banks have custody of the money legally but it's not theirs.
But I think an ordinary checking/savings account at a bank will show that you have a balance with them that's actually a credit with them, and they owe you the money if you ask to withdraw it as cash, but it's their money to spend on things like loans to other customers. And if you want to dispute it with them, probably the terms and conditions stipulated that you waived your right to a jury trial or a class action and will go to arbitration and you will find out out that they have your money.

Well what a propaganda show like RT is going to do, is they are going to host something like 80% things that are true, and 20% things that are the State's propaganda. They will mix true with false.
Also, like old KGB operations, they will foment any discontent that they can. So you're going to see things on their show like Noam Chomsky, civil rights activists, bitcoin activists etc. 
It doesn't make those guests or those points of view invalid. It's just that you have to pay attention to the larger picture and not vote in a Russian puppet.

Theres a really cool book about how to get rich by Fisher
I read it a long time ago and its pretty funny and cool. 
Spoiler basically theres a few main ways to do it - real estate lawyer, celebrity, famous sports athlete, inheritance, marry into wealth, investments, gambling, professions like dentist or plumber...
Read the book then it will be in your mind. 
Then when youre dating wealthy women (or men whatever dont mean to assume your gender) you might realize that could just be wealthy in a relationship... 
Bitcoin appeals to the luck of a gambler and the iamverysmart style of investor. But if we are truly so smart we shoupd keep seeing good opportunities in difficult to understand but future tech. Bitcoin might be one of those future things. But there will be many more.
Anyway, most people probably need to have 1 to 2 million before they realize that its not that life changing, because you carry around your own narrow perspective around as baggage

YES that is absolutely what I am saying :)
Example - this is the cool person on pastebin that posted their brainwallet curiousity -  
Just relax, read it, take a walk, have a beer, take another walk, re-read it, etc until you can relax and think up a calm plan. Don't wait forever, but you *might* have something that can "prove" to a robin hood that you aren't a competing brain-wallet sweeper, but the real deal.
And before that, there was a bitcoin Robinhood who did the same, who is actually a German researcher guy.
They sweep wallets, because people make mistakes. And to them, the social capital of being a good person is bigger than "bitcoin gains".
I think this user goes by the name 'johoe' on bitcoin talk but be careful - just in case their account gets hacked or anything like that so be cautious :)
Neither of those people is me; if I could do what they do, I WOULD help you. I have bitcoin too, and shit happens.
Outside chance that walletrecoveryservices.com knows them? Not sure what kind of community exists around recovering lost/stolen bitcoin. Wallet recovery specializes in that situation - a wallet you can't get into.  This is different, this is swept brainwallets, and that's a different guy. But they might know each other? A bit of a long shot.

The funniest thing to do if you owned these coins, to really throw people off, would be to have CSW's Twitter get hacked, post a pubkey/private key pair for one of the 100 BTC wallets, and send it to a burn address and say 'Suck it fools', peace out.
That .... would make a lot of people believe these are CSW's coins and you could go have fun for a year or two.

I am a simple man, maybe I'm wrong, but I am assuming that bitcoin mining and it's costs might be similar to selling corn futures and farming:
You could definitely tear that one apart and say that bitcoin mining is exactly nothing like growing corn and corn futures, to which I shrug and say, I think the logic of why futures help is the same in both, so despite the many differences, the main idea is the same.

Supporting your comments here.
Also BitGoyim who you're debating here, he's a lightweight compared to and I had the misfortune of debating that guy 3 years ago (4 years ago?) in reddit comments -- long story short, debating that guy was unbelievably demoralizing for me.
But I am glad that in the end, I didn't listen to him, I had the courage of my convictions and became fucking rich like I planned.

"Crack up boom" - yes kind of agree. These early times, where people feel the wealth effect, rising asset prices (like stocks), well, once the stimulus runs its effects, and the inflation hits, it can all end super fast.
If they start running the presses, and printing dollars at a fast rate, it's over. It just depends on how long people think dollars are not going to be printed ...
And as long as prices in ordinary goods stay low, that staves it off just a little longer ...
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:34:00
Having more vendors take the coin (something bitcoin is better at than Monero) is not the same thing as coins having a publicly viewable history. That public history lets you taint bitcoins with chainanalysis and refuse to accept them at major brokers like Coinbase. So if you take a gambling win and try to cash out at Coinbase you're stuck. On the flipside, Coinbase doesn't take Monero.
Monero is fungible, but it's not accepted at as many places or those businesses with super strict AML/KYC - so it doesn't have the same liquidity (you cant sell it as easily)

It dips up and down like that, like 10% as a normal circumstance.
What can happen now is a race over the next year to 4x, or two or three long years of slow slide down to $3.5k or something.
Check out Fibonacci retracements ... 
So because we have this nice round $10k number, you can follow the graph and look for prices just above ... 
$6180, $5000, $3820, $2360 etc.
Thats how far down things can reach looking for support, when it goes up, do the Fibonacci's the other way.

Fucking tell me about it. My 401k was so badly handled that they underperformed the market, getting about 1/2 the S&amp;P500 returns. Fuck me. So then I got into a more self-directed version and things have been closer to ordinary gains.
But yeah, with their mismanagement, the employer's matching funds were basically flushed down the toilet. If I'd known they were going to fuck up so badly, I would have just taken the tax hit on my salary as income, and then independently invested in my own stock picks. I could have done zillions of times better than those morons.
Right now that same fund is screwing over my oblivious coworkers as it 'invests' their money, some allocation is bonds, some of that foreign bonds, so of course they are invested in Argentina, Iraq, Greece and Venezuela. That's going to explode and leave them without income. Fuck. But that's what you get if you let other people run your money life. Misallocation, mismanagement.

..... yes? :) that's all that a "colored coin" is. 
Ultimately, down to the level of about 100 to 1000 satoshis is where the real game is. We're going to turn bitcoin into petabyte sized global database to store what really matters. Not trivial stuff like spending bitcoin to buy stuff.
Deep down I at least am trying to turn bitcoin into an uncensorable time stamp database. We'll use it to store records of who owns what.
You know, not everyone has the same goals. :) Just consider me to be along for the ride! Other people with other goals are welcome here too and I welcome them, and it's off to the races. We can fork the coin when needs are incompatible. We can't see the future, so who knows.

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:05:21
A store of value is not what you might think - it's not that 1.0 bitcoin is worth $19k today, and has the same purchasing power in the future.
It's that it's the SAME bitcoin sometime in the future, is just as usable as bitcoin is now, that future people will accept current day bitcoin as future bitcoin.
I give bitcoin a 98% chance of being usable much like now in 100 years. There's maybe a 1% chance it entirely dies (in which case it wasn't a lasting store of value) or a 1% chance that the way you use it now is so different compared to how you have to use it in the future that effectively your bitcoin "rotted" - like if bitcoin forks so hard, or a future alt-coin becomes bitcoin and steals old balances.

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:36:59
Kind of. Sometimes whales are faking it. In that they're not seriously trying to sell. If people start nibbling the wall at that level, maybe the smart thing to do would be to pull it, take the cash you got, buy downwards into the left side of buy orders (take those cheap bitcoins) - and let the bulls that remain wipe out the sell orders past your wall in order to start a breakout you've faked up.
EDIT: another possibility is that this is just a person who wants to sell, is new at it, and just wants to get out with a number they wrote on a napkin, no looking back. They are kindly doing us a favor in that sense. And we are close .... enjoy the show :)

@_date: 2017-12-15 20:08:58
Yeah you could have a fee versus block reward target. 
If fees exceed 1% of the block reward, the next block is allowed to be bigger?
As long as one miner doesn't have more than 51% of the network, then they're losing money on fees. 
UNLESS a majority of miners band together, and spam the network, to increase the blocksize to something absurd, like 100GB blocks (filled with little transactions), just to drive other people out.
Hard to game theory that out, but it might be possible to think up the different attacks.
Someone's probably done a good job of writing a maths paper on the topic.
Bitcoin just chose 1 MB blocks. Segwit moved the witness data out of the part that counts as "a block" and tacked it into a part that's not counted. So that lets blocks grow in size, indirectly.
But I'm not sure whats the best way to have non-spammy blocks.

That's okay to run out of 'new investors' or (pejoratively) 'bag holders'.
It's good that bitcoin has to make the change over from a get-rich-quick scheme where passing the bag to the Greater Fool is the 'plan' towards instead seeing VC capital go to creating businesses which add real value to whatever cryptocurrency payment rail makes sense -- and bitcoin only makes the most sense because of the large network effect.
So it's not a sad or a bad thing that bitcoin has to prove itself. That's how it should go.
And if people see the bitcoin value and think it's not worth it, or is worth it, collectively to whatever the market is currently valuing it at, then that's just where bitcoin is. 
It could do more the bigger the price gets, but here is where it is now.
And next, I think bitcoin just has to survive the waves of Johnny-come-lately altcoins that are bound to show up as smart people try to make niche coins towards new audiences, hoping for a piece of that sweet sweet cryptocurrency market share, some are succeeding and some are failing for various reasons:  Ripple (closed garden - and they seem to be able to mesmerize banks, but still a scam), Dogecoin (altcoin, meme, and community-ish), Litecoin (??), PayCoin (scam), Monero (technology niche), etc.
I think the altcoin groups that are not scams and have real community will be disappointed over time that they didn't stick with bitcoin.   And the high-tech altcoins which serve niches will last until bitcoin altchains something like them into a sidechain. But that could be a while.
The others, the scams will come and go, they are endless. Like people selling any kind of scam.

I didn't realize extension blocks would be a possibility. It would be interesting if you went from where we are now, where either you fully validate 1MB blocks or you are an SPV client - 
TO a future where you either fully validate or go SPV at any power of 10 or power 2 order of magnitude in blocksize. (Power of 10 might be best, so that you make firmer commitments).
Then you might choose to fully validate 1MB, and validate 10MB, but SPV the 100 MB blocks, and keep the requirement of very mature coins, like 100 blocks, before letting coins move between main and extension blocks.
I could see it, that would scale nicely.
EDIT: I'm assuming that the 10MB blocks are a merge-mined sidechain that's pegged to bitcoin, and that the sidechain has a 100 block delay/lockup between moving coins back from the sidechain and out to bitcoin.

Not much, it's just another coin? It's a little bit dated maybe? It makes some old business models (Satoshi Dice) viable again, shrug?
I wish bitcoin hadn't forked, adopted an 8meg limit or a floating limit; segwit seems okay, I see why they wanted to put that outside the main 1meg area. 
I can think of some crypto ideas that I wish were in bitcoin, but for now, it's okay that they're not.

LN is like you and me passing back and forth 1/2 signed IOUs with a better and better deal with each IOU. If the other side goes off and becomes unresponsive, the other side can cosign and play to the bitcoin network their last best IOU.
That's the simple payment channel explanation. 
You could almost do it with bitcoin today, except I think that transaction malleability lets people play games. And they need a relative lock time. I think both are soft forks so they don't break bitcoin for people that don't care to upgrade. Which is good. 
The harder version of LN has a riddle-passing scheme that lets chunks of the IOU get passed between people even people you didn't originally set up the channel with(!)
The second one will probably work, I'm just worried that what gets written to the blockchain will be something really bad like what looks like me signing a transaction to some guy in Iran in exchange for oil. When all I thought I had was a payment channel to Starbucks. So we'll see.
I personally think we need way bigger blocks, LN, and one or two more great ideas. Then we're there. :)

You know the popular theory about six degrees of separation...
If it's true, pretend you could know with some level of accuracy where coins are going to or from, with about 80% accuracy.
With 6 degrees of separation, and 1000 transactions per person in a big mesh..
How many steps down the chain do you have to go before you're about 50% accurate about who is paying whom?
I always wondered.
Because it seems like bitcoin may be, like any mesh of transactions (like phone calls), much much much much more traceable than people think.
Thanks much good luck at your presentation.

Oh you'll love this then -- 
check out 
They have a tutorial all about "candles" - those are just a standardized way of showing open, close, and high and low for a price of something in a given time period. There is a convention like green or white for the body of the candle if the close is higher (good for sellers), and black or red if the body of the candle if the closing price is lower. The wicks coming off the candle - the top wick is the highest price it reached, the bottom wick is the lowest it reached. Based on the shape of the candle and patterns of it, you can get an idea of how the market was acting. It's rather interesting.
Painting the tape is something, not good in a normal market, where you buy or sell at a moment (usually near the end of a period) like right before the 15 minute mark, the hour mark, or the day, you quickly buy or sell in order to set the mark (for the close) at a certain level to give the illusion of price movement and cover up other trends. It's called painting the tape.

That's an interesting definiton. Hmm. I was just studying up on the different ways that projects have to move forward. One was smoothing where you just put off the conflict. Another was confronting where you get towards a solution maybe finding a win-win. Another was avoiding (which they call lose-lose, but may be a set up in a bigger game where it's lose-win), and another was compromise (win? lose?) and forcing (win-lose).
I wonder if intelligence is the applications of these kinds of strategies and I wonder what kind of time scale makes sense. For some peope the timescales they're thinking of are transcendental (beyond their own life span) and for others the timescale is this quarterly report, or until their retirement, or on to the next job, the next business deal, etc.

You're counting the cost that holders - who chose to hold bitcoin are hypothetically paying. If they don't want to hold bitcoin, they can sell their bitcoin.
Actual transaction costs are tiny, for the people that use it like a currency.
To compare to Ripple, the price is to get in and out of bitcoin on each end, to and from fiat.

Is cooling a major cost? Yes and no. The electricity to mine gives off waste heat. They usually have to move it along. The last round of mining photos from China I saw looked like a warehouse set up like a swamp cooler with water soaking cardboard walls and fans pointing out through it. 
KnC apparently just mines up in the Arctic Circle and vents the waste heat.
But anyway, if you use electric baseboard heating - you use electricity and produce heat.
If you bitcoin mine, you use electricity and get bitcoin and heat. The price of bitcoin should be the approximate match as if you had the best prices for electricity in the world. 
That's not exactly the case for a typical household with electric heat. Eg, my awesomely low Pacific Northwest electric bills (hydropower, solar, thermal and other green sources) is coming in around 8 cents a kilowatt.
But if you're in China you might be getting electricity for free or 3 or 4 cents a kilowatt. 
Regardless, if you bitcoin mine, you get the heat as a byproduct and you can sell the bitcoin to the market -- and you got the waste heat for free.
Electric bitcoin space heaters and water heaters would be the hugest win for the bitcoin network and for consumers.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:55:33
Yeah bitcoins, to me, are like a scarce stock of something which could be useful.
Like a law office needing a phone number, to attach a fax machine to, so that they can be more efficient at getting documents to clients, getting them signed and sent back, and so on. A phone number is that. That's what a bitcoin address will be like, except it will be for payments and billing and whatnot.
So I hope that bitcoins wind up being useful as a cross-border payment system for import/export businesses, and that a typical big business like BMW or IBM will need about 10 bitcoin (or more is better, makes things easier) but could get by with just 1 bitcoin (but higher fees, less convenience) and some strange places like MIT or Harvard will have thousands of donated bitcoin and their life, in a bitcoin economy, will be way more efficient, but it'll be just another resource.

Politics. German voters not keen on bailouts of Greeks and other PIIGS banks. Problem is that German export powerhouse depends on the loans and imports from other parts of the Eurozone. And those weaker sections got their boom years in the past when they suddenly got cheap loans out of being in the euro zone. Now they're in a hangover period. There will be bail-ins later. Bad loans which honestly the banks like PNB Paribas and others should have just eaten.
TL;DR, the euro is trying to cover too big an area. People don't notice this as much with the dollar but it has similar problems between red state / blue state, even inside of a single state like California.

Kind of -- 
Probably whoever comes up with LN will have to make a series of unit and integration tests for wallets that lay out the test cases pretty clearly and let them get compatible.
LN itself at one level is going to be a simple payment channel. They called it a Poon-Dryja channel or something :)  But it sounded like a simple subscriber and a sign off. That might be one level of LN, the simple version.
The next layer of LN was going to have a riddle-solving thing that makes at least parts of the payment channel transitive. In my imagination, bigger chunks of your payment channel will become mobile riddles that can hold bitcoin and move around between people in the LN in order to settle things out in really interesting ways. 
If I locked up 10 bitcoin in a LN mesh, maybe big 1.0 bitcoin chunks might become these interesting transitive riddle boxes valued at 1.0 bitcoin and those would become these big mobile chunks. 
That second part would require a lot of compatibility testing.
But the main idea though is all doable with bitcoin almost as-is. I guess a soft fork is needed for the relative lock time, their time out system.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:09:37
There is already an efficient miner backbone that passes things around efficiently. So amongst members of that backbone group blocks already propagate very efficiently.
Around the time Gavin worked on the idea of invertible Bloom filters he found out that some miners had tackled the problem in a less elegant but still effective and kind of similar way.
So I think that blocksize worries about bandwidth and orphans are FUD. There already exists an efficient block propagation method.p

I think my ancestors used tally sticks to track debts.
I think other civilizations had quipu (knots in strings) and weird clay objects that contained contracts, Yap stones, all kinds of interesting things used as money (debt or favor memory).
I am not sure that tally sticks are "money" as much as they are a way of remembering, which depending on how you think about it is nearly the same thing.
But people have gotten so used to sovereign issued gold or silver or other metal coins, debasement, notes as a reference to gold or silver, and then just plain fiat, that what money once was is getting very distorted.  Gold especially is a horizon that people's memory of money seems to stop out at, when obviously it goes much further back.
I've always wondered if those Stone Age teardrop shaped obsidian objects were money, artwork, or tools (like an axehead) but maybe it will always remain a mystery. They were ... probably money/art.
Anyway, bitcoin/cryptocurrencies make me happy to see money go back towards being a universal memory of something...

Yep, it's the depositors that will take the brunt. 
The wealthy elites that control each countries' banking and finance sector are fairly immune to the effects of finance going out of control. Wealth is not money -- wealth is power and assets and control. They're not living on tiny savings accounts.
Bankster problems like this are starting to make me a believer in postal savings accounts held with the government itself. It's their fiat, so fine, here's a savings account. They won't invest it in anything worth a damn, but at least they can't lose the money as they can print more out of thin air. And since they do nothing with it, they don't contribute much and the savings isn't put to productive use. But who cares about the savings of the 99%? They have basically nothing.
I think we are overthinking banking and finance. I say we let the 1% play their dog-eat-dog bloodsport on each other's money and investments.

Oh you got me there! :) "investment"
Percent of US citizens invested in the stock market - directly? Maybe 1-2%, I could go find a source. Indirectly, like 401ks? IRAs? Maybe higher, 5-10%?
(OOPS I am so wrong, found a source, Gallup 2017 - "In Gallup's April 2017 update, 54% of Americans report having money invested in stocks.")
Yeah the stock market has been very weird lately. Stocks like Amazon, they try not to be profitable. Instead they go for growth. If you were cynical, you would think that their intention is to take over the entire market for selling products in the USA or worldwide. That has to hit an S-curve at some point - then the game of finding a Greater Fool to buy their stock gets harder and harder.
If you changed the rules of the stock market entirely and you said (not suggesting this, but imagine it): say you turned it around and said that 100% of the gains on selling stock were taxed. That ALL of the Greater Fool speculation will be taxed, but dividends weren't taxed. THEN things would flip around fast, suddenly stocks would have to pay a dividend to be worth something, and then I think that things would get interesting in the stock market.
Hmm so anyway, I'm not sure that what's happening in the US stock market right now can be called 'Investing' anymore. My 2 cents :) lol

Yes, the miners (its more complex than this, but a simple example)
Bitcoin miners are now no longer common computer CPUs nor GPUs, nor FPGAs. People do mine "altcoins" on those, but bitcoins are mined on chips optimized for SHA256 called ASICs.
The miners take a bundle of transactions and add a coinbase transaction at the top to pay themselves.
They come up with a number used once (nonce) that's random, they have their mining equipment check ranges of nonces.
Why a nonce?
They're running SHA256 on the transactions and looking for leading zeroes. It's like a limbo game, where lower numbers are better.
The number of leading zeros is the difficulty. 
To see what this is kind of like, go to a site where you can get the SHA256 of a message, then look for a leading zero.
Add a number at the end of the text, and check if there's even 1 zero at the beginning (1/16 chance in hexadecimal), average you have to make 8 guesses to get 1 zero.
If the "difficulty" in my made up example was 3 leading zeros, you'd have to try more nonces in order to find a random number that showed you put in the work to find the solution. You can't fake that effort, and it's easy for me to check that you did it.
Part of what you're mining, forgot to mention this, is that you point backwards to the previous block. Together these blocks, each pointing backward to a parent, is a blockchain.
Everyone agrees to accept the most work (proof of work) and make that the bitcoin chain. If two blocks arrive at the same time ... I think it's ambiguous until a miner builds on one or the other. Then that's the longest chain, and starts to get built on further.
Here's a site with SHA256 as an example:
The example text there is Hello world!
I added a 0, then checked, a 1 then checked, etc.
Got unlucky, took me Hello world!23
Before I got the hash with just one leading 0
Hope this helps, bitcoin.org has more info.
Miners in pools could mine for themselves, but if they mine what the pool tells them to, the payout is to the pool. They could try a block withholding attack. But that's a long story.

Ah it's never enough. The problem is the fiat side, the dollars.
So if I have bitcoin, and I can sign a message, then you know I truly do possess the private key. You don't know if I'm the owner of the bitcoin (a legal concept) but you know I have possession.
Now on your side, you have an FDIC bank account with dollars in it. They're digital dollars, but ... 
Say we had an advance, and the Federal Govt made up a FedCoin. It had some basic rules but it turned out be easy-ish to route around. Maybe some of the rules are that it has to go to only signed up individuals or businesses and the commands to move money around have to get settled centrally, with them.
Then I have to make a side chain off bitcoin that becomes some kind of high-speed transaction "coin" but which is probably really a database in exchange servers. 
Then the exchange has to work with either real bitcoin or database entries and FedCoin. 
It's just still not enough. FedCoin wants too many rules for this to work.
A lot of the bad and dodgy things around bitcoin are caused by its relationship to fiat money. 
It's those relationships that get your accounts shut down etc and even why you need multisig to move money here and there.
It's like you can try, and trying is maybe better than nothing... but for me bitcoin is one way, it's not going to be cashed back out for dollars.

It's definitely safer to run code that's closer to what 90% of the hashing power and markets want, but I agree it doesn't have to be 100%. It could be 99%. Any small sliver that holds out against the majority and doesn't take steps to avoid being mined on out of nowhere would get washed away into an easily attacked alt-bitcoin. 
My hope is not for 1MB blocks or not, I'd prefer no limits, but maybe 20MB is a good compromise to keep running full nodes doable by hobbyists. I am a fan of trying whatever we can to make the bitcoin dream viable way up to VISA scale or maybe just a tenth of it ;)

These alts are so interesting. I see a lot of this happening in the future. People late to bitcoin, but with social network access big enough to jump start their altcoin instead of evangelizing bitcoin. With their altcoin, they can premine it, jumpstart a social network, rake in the huge conversion fees selling their alt for bitcoin or for cash, and later the community would probably realize they can only use their altcoin in the small altcoin space, and take the altcoin+bitcoin. (These are kind of selfish altcoins but not scams I think, here's where I think Auroracoin and the like go)   If Facebook ever made a cryptocurrency, that's what they'd do, make a Facebookcoin.
Another late comer strategy to bitcoin is to look at bitcoin's flaws, know how to code something which is arguably better (or not, doesn't matter), code it, and then try to jumpstart and excite a community. I see coins and systems, Etherium is probably the most successful. Brilliantly thought up. (I don't think these are scams, they are just cool experiments that have a shot at being bitcoin 2.0)
And another type of altcoins are sadly, just scams :/

say that block 1 and block 2 came from different groups of miners. In each block is a transaction that couldn't be in both.
Later, someone mines onto block 2, adding to block 2, and not pointing back to block 1.
If more people mine onto block 2, then the transactions that were in block 1 are effectively not mined anymore. They were, back in block 1, but the ones that are valid would be back out to the mempool or forgotten. 
If you replayed the transaction that got mined in block 1 (but that block has been dropped by the network in favor of the new chain starting at block 2, sideways to block 1), then that new transaction would not be valid. You had it's outputs used/spent and that transaction got mined in block 2.
Other people's transactions that were in block 1 might still be valid, and could be mined if a miner wanted to. Maybe those people would have to replay their transactions to make sure they get mined eventually.

Ah, well some of those nodes might or might not already know about the transaction. If they've never heard of it, they tell others and put it in their mempool. If they have already heard of it, they don't tell others. Everyone has their own mempool, they are not all 100% the same. They are mostly the same though I think.
Here are the steps on transactions:
Next there is a more advanced way that nodes and miners can talk to each other, since reducing the latency on knowing the existence of things like blocks can help miners not waste hashing power on a block that might not get chosen as the longest chain.
So there are protocols where the nodes can infer from their mempool to another nodes, what the missing transactions are. The math is neat. It's called an Inverse Bloom filter. (Bloom was the person that came up with the general mathematical idea in the 1970s).
It's a way to retrieve information and have an idea if the remote node already knows the same transactions you do and quickly figure out which ones they don't have and vice-versa.
Forgive me, I can't recall if Bitcoin FIBRE is using that same tech idea or a different thing. But the point is that there are many ways to keep node's mempools of unconfirmed transactions efficiently relayed.
There isn't a thing in bitcoin I think like Ethernet's Time to Live packet.
Nodes though can shun or drop other nodes from connecting to them.
If you send nodes valid signed junk then it's just another unconfirmed transaction to it's mempool, and each node can have their own rules about which ones they want to remember.
The main idea is that the blockchain is what determines long-term truth in the system about what has actually been spent or moved around etc.

I totally disagree with this thinking that the fees are something miners are going to live on. 
The fees are there for spam reduction and that's all. To wear out spammers so that they can't spam spam spam by putting some friction on the process so that they at least run out of bitcoins to do it with.
Miners should be mining for the block reward's coinbase that's it. The fees are a nice bonus but not the main point.
The miners should want bitcoin to be useful and used by a lot of people. The more people use and need bitcoin to participate in the bitcoin network, the more the bitcoins that miners mine are worth.
The holders of bitcoin are the ones "paying" indirectly, through dilution, for the long expansion of the system and who effectively "pay" for the transactions by that watering down.
But the holders of bitcoin knew that going into it. 
Miners can choose to hold or sell the bitcoins they mine, which is a separate issue for them to hedge.

Question 1 - about making changes to the system
As another reply said below, there are these major groups in bitcoin - miners, users, holders (speculators), developers, businesses (like exchanges), hardware manufacturers, etc. Sometimes you have some combos like devs+businesses, miners+manufacturers all in one. 
Each group has a really hard time changing the system. Everyone in the system would like more of the 'value' of this collective system to go to them, but constrain the total coins overall. No one inside the system, except newcomers, is going to be interested in lifting the 21 million coin limit. A few are interested in relaxing it slightly, like making a smooth emission curve, but bitcoin conservatives like me prefer for now (maybe forever) sticking to the halving that's coming (I'm a user/holder).
People or organizations OUTSIDE bitcoin have basically no effect on the rules of the system. Only people in the system have much effect, and they have that effect by what they invest real resources on, and what they think others think bitcoin is. You can invest millions of dollars to make a new ASIC that has an alternative proof of work, but I'm (a user) not interested. Therefore that investment would be wasted. These game theory effects keep people in line.
Devs sometimes think of cool new ideas that the theory of bitcoin should be getting better and better at - pseudonymity, maybe difficulty retargeting, new ciphersuites, ideas like Hash Time Locked Contracts, and what those things let you do.
A lot of people see bitcoin as like a money, and the blockchain is tracking balances moving around, and it is that, but it's also a token system to track asset ownership, and do colored coins, and it is also a system of running little miniature programs. Bitcoin transactions are little pieces of digitally signed code.
What makes a valid program, what op codes exist, what effects those have, like bugs, might get widely fixed. Tightening up the rules is not something anyone can stop YOU from choosing to do. YOU could choose to only accept certain kinds of op codes to bitcoin to your node, but you might be a fool if you didn't accept new blocks if like 99% of the market of everyone else is following something else. You could start a fork at any time, and if you stick with SHA256, your fork could get attacked pretty trivially by someone willing to waste resources to teach a lesson or steal from you. Loosening the rules though, that requires an agreed upon hard fork by pretty much a vast majority of the community, I'd say at least 80%, but maybe 90%+. How people feel about changes like a larger block size are what created bitcoin cash.
Question 2 - taking down bitcoin and the blockchain
The source code to run a bitcoin node is "out there" you can't remotely delete source code files on other people's machines. Bitcoin nodes used to be CPU miners. 
Bitcoin the protocol is pretty small network wise, and you can tunnel it over VPN/TOR but it would obviously be less convenient. You can hide bitcoin messages like a transaction in almost anything you can store/transmit.
Nation states can make participating or connecting to a bitcoin network either difficult or literally illegal, those are challenges, but probably some part of the world would be free, and the unfree could VPN/TOR over to it and do what they want, or find less direct workarounds. That's part of the whole satellite bitcoin node movement.
Nation states are pretty lazy, so they're more likely to use somewhat blunt things like blockchain analysis, firewalls, maybe network takedowns, and police doorkicking squads to goon around to try and stop bitcoin. You know, in a tough enough police state, it can be hard on bitcoin, but it would never be 100% effective globally and is kind of a waste of their time.
The clever state bureaucrats will load up on bitcoin secretly.

That's hard to find in computing in general.
There is a lot of change management, vulnerability management, risk management, etc at play. 
When you see large well funded services like Google's search, or Amazon and Microsoft's clouds trying to stay up and working, they have their problems and they are orders of magnitude ahead in funding and organization.
Anyway, in the bitcoin space, what is or isn't a good service in one year can in a year change; they can fall behind, not keep up with new previously unknown vulnerabilties, and go from great to garbage. It's a moving target, there is no end. That's computing and complexity together.
Bitcoin itself is fairly simple. Cold storage to paper wallets like bitaddress.org for large amounts and a simple phone-based Android or iPhone wallet for day to day spends.

Any way to combine .bit (NameCoin) and .onion?
Or do we want the situation (maybe we do) to be that - if you control the private key, you control the domain. So ...  whoever captures or seizes it (or has a copy) gets to screw with it as they will?
That's oddly in sync with bitcoin's ethos - whoever has the private key controls the bitcoin.

PayPal can give chargebacks' benefits to the consumer lets say. But it's the merchant that chooses to have their stuff sold through PayPal, knowing in advance that PayPal will handle chargebacks and mediation.
If PayPal took bitcoin, they'd have to add a bit of a fee to cover chargebacks right? But it wouldn't be very different than their current business.
Bitcoin can be that layer, like cash or VISA, that sits underneath PayPal's oversight of your consumer purchase with merchants that use it too. 
You could have an escrow company in bitcoin that consumers and merchants can opt into. You might feel assured to see a store which sells things for bitcoin - and stands behind its products enough to make an escrow offer available (tiny fee taken by the escrow company).

I thought to myself: Is this a company that's trying to be the best exchange for traders, or are they just looking to live the high life?
If they want to live the high life, or are bored running an exchange, why don't they sell it and move on before failures mount and they go down like Mt Gox and Karpeles' frappachino stand in the lobby?

The network where you and I can send each other bitcoin tokens without having to involve a third party is the value created.
The notional tokens have a future value and that's what they are endlessly trading other currencies for. So in and out, depending on how much risk or de\-risk they want, future prospects that they either believe or "know" will happen, etc.
The value of the market for bitcoins itself is price discovery, that's valuable. Maybe you would give it a different price, this lets you get a reality check on the current barometer of price and implied value, and you can make your own choices. If bitcoin is more valuable to you than the market price, hold. If the market thinks bitcoin should be a lower price than you value it at, then buy. If the market has a price way way higher than you think its worth, or you have too much risk in your portfolio and want to de\-risk into less volatile things, then sell.

Yeah, those are bitcoin miners who are spending heavy into ASICs and hooking us up. They somehow think they will be more profitable doing that and getting bitcoins that way, than spending their money on just buying bitcoin. And the holders (bag holders if you feel sarcastic) are the ones using it like a "store of value" (airquoting it for you) because they are speculating that the price will rise. It just doesn't matter what it's costing per day, because enough people out there are floating it by their hard work (designing and installing ASICs at a rapid pace - something like 2 months to annually on hardware replacements, with very perilous risk of poor returns on investment) or have hodled since January and lost a lot of money (denominated in fiat, even if their holdings of bitcoin has stayed steady).
But they still think it's worth it, so the system "pays" that much a day... I get it but it's not a compulsory system, you don't have to 'buy in', hodl, or mine. You can just use it as-is for those times when it works for you and if you never run into those situations where you need it, don't use it?

Yes, it's a 'disinflationary' currency - meaning, it inflates, but at a continuously lower rate - right now a pretty heavy inflation rate via seignorage by mining, eventually will inflate near parity with the dollar, and eventually inflate at a lower rate than the dollar.

Kryder's Law increases disk space faster than Moore's Law increases transistor density. So storage won't be a big deal.
Passing messages around could be more, but VISA level of messages with some decent network hosting is not that much bandwidth now, ~1TB a month I think. Somewhere in the 1TB range and that's for VISA, not bitcoin. That's $120 a month for the bandwidth in and out at Amazon EC2 - and those are today's prices, not future prices if or when bitcoin ever catches up to VISA transaction speeds - so it should be cheaper in the world of tommorrow.

I don't think it has to...
In bitcoin, you might have an address and bitcoins going into there are like a reserved pool where all the altchains value in bitcoin is stored.
Then over on the altchain they can make up any rules they like about how bitcoin value becomes altcoins on their chain.
Then going back out from altcoins, they can destroy or recover their altcoins however they want...
But the max value back in bitcoin is capped by the amount of bitcoin in the altcoins reserved pool back in the blockchain.
That's one way to do it...

Sure the idea is that if you have a roomful of people, there's a good chance that if everyone announced their birthday, that you would find out that it's pretty common for two people to have the same birthday. 
That's because you're not being specific about which two people or which day ;)
For each person you're looking at a sum of probabilities that some other person also has the same birthday. 
Say it's 30 people in the room. 1st person has a random birthday. Each additional person has a 1/365 chance of having a birthday on the same day. So about a 1/30 chance per person of a match.
But there's 30 people in the room, so there's almost a 100% chance of a match of two people's birthdays.
Scaling it up to bitcoin though, don't worry, as I like the math at this page which explains:
The address space is so mind-bogglingly collossal.
It's way more likely that instead, you would have a bad pseudo-random number generator.

Yeah I think it might have been a mistake if it's true that DPR coded his own captcha. Apparently it was quite distinctive. So seeing Silk Road-style captcha could be probable cause? I think I heard that it was pink and white or something like that instead of the usual look.
But great point about the need to establish probable cause (get a warrant) THEN do the search. Why was getting a warrant such a problem? Because they were being fast and loose cowboys? Parallel construction? A warrant is a very very basic measure of oversight. Probably any judge in the land who thought they had the standing to give it would have given a warrant. Would this have had to be the FISA court? Maybe. So go to the FISA court and get a warrant.
I bet that even the judge presiding over the case would have given a warrant (for what it's worth) if the FBI had asked. I would bet that the FBI could go to a judge, tell them about their case, and get a judge to "sign" a warrant in the middle of the night from a cell phone call at some future date - it's that high profile a case. No problem.
No warrant? Invalid evidence - fruit of the poisonous tree. The FBI agents f-d this one up and so did their supervisor. They could have completely blown this case and they know it.

Secure-ish. 
It would normally be protected against 3rd parties seeing it, because it goes by in HTTPS.
But the URL, as a GET statement would be visible in normal everyday web server logs. They might upload those logs to places for log analysis. Or let it slip by somewhere to an employee that isn't cleared to see that kind of information.
And the Cloudflare is a problem, they provide DDoS protection, but they also front-end your HTTPS site and to them, they see the traffic in the clear - as if they were the remote website entirely - so GET/POST doesn't matter, they see everything.
Clever government would subpoena Cloudflare, because their whole business model dies if the government shuts them down. Both sides would agree to keep quiet (Cloudflare to save their business, government to keep access to information) and over time, tinfoil hat, Cloudflare will MITM as much as they can, and the government will recommend them as a service (anti-DDoS protection) rather than waste scarce resources chasing script-kiddies using DDoS tools (unless it's Anonymous, who they will hunt to the ends of the Earth, for some unknown reason.

Yeah, but it could be at an equilibrium in a sense.
Like there are holders out there, who might change their mind a little or a lot today, they'll sell. Others might want to buy and may or may not change their mind, by a little or a lot, and buy. 
Miners, people with experience making ASICs, who think - wow I have super cheap electricity, the fab plant, I could mine thousands of them, why not? And they make plans to bring it online. Other miners are dropping out.

"Refusing to make digital currencies legal tender, which would force merchants to accept them for payment, is understandable and central banks have a perfect right to decide what payment methods they themselves accept, but attempting to ban Bitcoin’s ownership and use is a different matter. How on earth do they propose to detect or punish somebody who chooses to store some wealth in a digital form?

I just meant that new things will continue to come out. If you can spot the good things, those will go up in value. 
Things that might go up more in value  -- one thing that jumps out about some tech companies - they try not to own things. Uber - no taxis, AirBNB - no properties, Netflix - eh, Facebook - , etc. So matching things up without ideally owning the underlying&gt; that seems like a trend.

Keynes, what a legacy.
Here's my take:
Before World War I, the world was pretty much on a gold standard. Also, there was a lot of Laissez-faire capitalism, and some very polarized views between owners/capitalists/bankers, and the general unwashed masses. Ideas like Socialism and Utopias of that kind were really believed in, and people thought those things could work. There were business cycles, miseries, booms and busts, and if you were wealthy, things probably didn't seem so miserable. Free markets, Adam Smith, etc. But if you were poor, Irish potato famine, working in mills, child labor, packed smoggy cities, unfair labor practices, etc. Above it all the bankers say that they really can't be funding lots of social programs, nor that organizing the economy can really be done, much less for social ends.
WWI breaks out and the Empires march to war. Their lousy military strategies kill millions in trench warfare, disease, landmines, machine guns, barbed wire, and gas. But behind the scenes a massive amount of government control of industry is put into place, along with wage fixing, price fixing, rationing and so on. 
WWI ends and people are dumped back onto the wheels of the laissez-faire capitalist state, but this time the workers are not fooled. It's clear to them that the old words that the government couldn't control the economy are hogwash. They clearly DID control the economy in order to fight WWI. So the government COULD fix prices, wages, etc. (We know now all of this nonsense as silly Socialism/Communism, doomed to fail, etc, but some people were big believers in this.)
Hence, when communism started up in Russia in like 1917 under Lenin, there was wide wide wide international support and Socialism everywhere ready to take over governments if they didn't get their acts together.
In the backdrop of the Great Depression, some countries like the United States under FDR, did anything they could, enacting any possible program or legistlation that would help jump start the economy again. This is how the idea that the government COULD jump start the economy, that it MUST, because it CAN, that the government is RESPONSIBLE FOR the economy... these ideas are rooted in WWI and Socialism.
Now we in the modern world, we are almost on the verge of asking ourselves WHY. WHY is the government in charge of the economy? (voters want jobs, that's why! Voters will vote into office those that promise some good jobs and a good economy, and they will vote out any bums that leave them jobless and helpless). 
Well in a Libertarian worldview, this is all upside down and the government doesn't have a good worthwhile role making jobs. The jobs and spending they come up with are just wasted. Their spending prolongs the agony of a downturn. Etc etc.
But Keynes he was kicked off the Board of the Bank of England, watched those idiots fuss and hum and hah doing jack squat. Keynes invested in the American stock market, warned those idiots that they needed to ease off the gold standard, print money like mad, had all kinds of brilliant ideas... He returned to the board at Bank of England, much much wealthier, told them off, led them out.
But still, Keynesian economics is a stupid pit. People keep it because it empowers them as rulers/leaders in government and banking, and the plebe wageslaves keep the system going because they think jobs are worthwhile and that government should make these jobs and the economy going.
Oh, of course eventually World War 2 comes along. And seriously, that was a war of existance for Russia, Britain, France, Poland, (well Germany too obviously), and all the stops were pulled out to win. Total state control. So again, after the war, people believe in 'Freedom' but they don't believe that the government CAN'T and SHOULDN'T run the economy. (Well some people believe that they SHOULDN'T, but no one thinks that governments CAN'T run the economy - they can run it badly obviously, or mediocre-ishly.)

To add to your point, the Catholic church also used to condemn and excommunicate people, and then the local govt I think would take care of burning the accused at the stake.
All that church power, gone.
I'm sure it would have been unimaginable to people in the Middle Ages that the church could lose so much of it's worldly power but still exist and be very large and wealthy.

Great point about how we could just buy many banks for a billion dollars. Make a Credit Union whose members have to be software developers.
"Are you a software developer? Join First Satoshi Credit Union!"
Then we could make up our own rules, still follow the regs and be the amazing bank of the future!
But in a sense, in this way, bitcoin is a tragedy like the 'Frog in a Well' phenomenon, where we assume that we are more alone in the world than we really are. Where our limited perspective keeps us in a hole. The low levels of trust, not liking authorities, trusting mathematics, those things are what maybe take us to bitcoin like moths to a flame.

I think in the meta, if bitcoin mining showed up in these countries and suddenly there's employment and jobs and a tax base and booming land values, then theyre all keen to help.
So if you're an industry like that, like maybe an aluminum smelter, then they think your industry is great. 
If you mine bitcoins they just think you raise their electric bills and offer no benefit to the local government (which provides the power and decides what you can use it for)
If it was a private power company they probably wouldnt mind someone paying to buy their spare capacity.
Government run power plants arent necessarily so great. I think big companies like Kodak used to run their own power plants for themselves.
Maybe someday bitcoin mining ops will run their own plants too.

It's filling idle time from the mining rigs.
So what miners want, really, is to mine a valuable coin. Blocks are more valuable if miners mine blocks that actually have transactions in it. Plus the little bit extra in fees is nice.
Okay, but when a new block comes out, that's been mined, you have to decide pretty quickly if it looks right and if you should give up and build on it. 
So you look at their block, confirm the hash is the right difficulty, confirm the transactions inside look valid, and then take out from your memory the transactions that are now confirmed in that block. Or maybe put them somewhere aside, in case things get orphaned and there's a reorg... Point being, whatever transactions were just mined won't be in the block you're going to mine.
Then you take and make up a block of your own and while you're deciding what you want to mine, which could take a little while to figure out .....
Are you going to let vast hashpower sit idle for 60 seconds while you figure out what to mine next? :)  NOPE
You set the miners to mine an empty block, because it's definitely valid, it has just the coinbase transaction at the top to pay you if you get lucky while you're thinking.
And then you sit down and go over the rules of transactions. Maybe you think the previous block looked questionable .... like it has some soft-forked things you're not so sure about....
But if you mine an empty block right after, win for you, and in a weird way, it's a win for the system - it unsticks people a bit. Things move on. Proof of Work is now building on that chain. 
You get something like 1000 blocks into the past with consensus on it and who knows whether it was smart or dumb to mine a given transaction? And who cares because it's buried under Proof of Work and undoing it is not going to happen.

Oh sure okay. 
There's one use case where the buyer is physically present, and another one where it's across the Internet.
In those cases where it's a face to face purchase using bitcoin, then you could have this concentration off-blockchain for a region.
Maybe use the triangles of a Dymaxion map, or subdivide a big triangle into 4 smaller ones as needed, and you can keep dividing those down. 
Or make a Latitude/Longitude zone and split it up into 4 squares if there's too much volume. You could have something like 4 or 5 degrees square and start cutting that down to 1 degree squares or even smaller if there's enough transaction volume.

If it was me and I had to make a system like this, I would keep some aspects of bitcoin's system, like an 'every two week difficulty targetting' and an every three year or so block reward halving..
But I would have put in something to allow nearly instant blocks, some way where a single set of inputs to outputs, by itself - just one transaction - is the basic block, and like 'squeezing a lemon' you could choose to find better and better hashes with more and more leading zeroes and get more and more of the reward. And then on a longer 10-minute cycle, blocks of blocks would be packaged up and put into a blockchain. 
Something like that. So you could get super fast confirmations and different kinds of miners. Transaction miners and block miners --- without Masternodes or anybody being more special than someone else other than their hash rate.

Dude, the problem with the idea is that there is literally no proving that I didn't spend it. 
Buy from Coinbase, transfer to mixer to cold storage or spend, how would you legitimately tell the difference? 
An honest person like me might say, okay it's in cold storage, but if someone else claimed it was mixed and spent years ago, how would you prove otherwise?
I'm not saying you can't jail people, fine them, or take all kinds of punitive measures. But it's also possible that you won't 100% be able to say who has and who hasn't got any assets.
Or if someone draws out $2000 a month in cash, for years, and says - that was pocket change, I spent it on restaurants, gas, clothes, whatever, all of it is long gone. How would you be able to prove that that wasn't what happened, as opposed to them secretly having $100,000? (it would only take about four years to amass that).
I don't think it's a great situation that bitcoin makes it so hard to go after people's assets - like how do you sue someone if they wreck something of yours and then claim to be poor? (They could be lying). Well, maybe more people will have to put up a bond or insurance before we trust them with anything.

Bitcoin's price is that of a speculative commodity right now. It's not a unit of account that everyday items are priced in (like dollars).
So the price fell off by a lot when the idea that there would be high use in China popped, so that cut it back quite a bit.
Another idea is that markets are markets and they go through booms and busts.
Or of course, maybe people got disillusioned, cashed out, and some are bagholders holding through a long decline? Or True Believers holding through the tough times. Or long term holders who have bought in at $10 each and are looking at 50x returns and seeing a number cut in half from HUGE to Really Big, that's not maybe bothering them...
There's probably a story you could get from each market participant, but in aggregate they all add up to the current price...

If you were long with leverage right now, you might have been margin called because bitcoin's price has been dropping.

(These price movements are pretty normal in bitcoin).
Getting short-squeezed feels more common, but you could get marginned out any time things go against you.

Well definitely people holding large quantities of bitcoin are targets for fraudsters.
The basic problem for an early holder, someone who shares libertarian/cypherpunk views and bought at MtGox or  back in the day, got maybe 1000+ bitcoins, is that ...
They might have realized at some point that their bitcoins, even if in cold storage, are just numbers in the ether.
Objectively speaking, they probably at some point want to either see their bitcoin numbers go up, their fiat numbers go up, or when they tire of that, cash out some or all of it for other things (stocks, real estate, a posh lifestyle, a wedding, medical necessity, etc).
Take the crowd of bitcoin enthusiasts with 1000+ btc. They might decide that they have 200 btc to play with. They might be looking already at a fiat value jump of 1000% in a year. So to them, 100% increases on their money look small. And they might easily lose 200 btc down crazy rat holes.
But to normal people making 100% on your money is pie-in-the-sky-crazy. And investments touting that kind of return are looked at with deep deep skepticism.
Anyway, totally expected the SEC warning. They're just still over in reasonable land and did not make 1000% last year.

It would be nice if there was something like Proof of Work without the wasted electricity, sure, and there might be another way. 
Proof of Stake is part of that exploration of alternatives. 
I'd say have hope - bitcoin is a system created by people - if something better comes along, bitcoin will either adopt it or be superseded by something better.
I think that people have to think deeply about what Proof of Work is doing and separate out all of those pieces before Proof of Work could be replaced (probably by several things working together).
I wouldn't mind Proof of Physical Location tied to Proof of Low Latency tied to Proof of High Bandwidth and Proof of No Firewall doing Filtering

Well it's a hedge, of a form. A good hedge in case of financial implosion. In the USA that's not pretty likely. I think I'm into bitcoin because of the technology, the utility, the potential upside. It's implicitly a short on any other thing I could be invested in (like dollars or gold), but I'm not in bitcoin to protect me from the downsides of those other assets or the larger dollar ecosystem (which I really can't escape or avoid, like having too few boats on the Titanic).
I think gold would be better in case of a disaster. Or clean water and food.

Yeah, would it have been worse if instead of SHA-256, if they had prepended a nonce to the transactions in some format and then done AES on it? 
That would have been neat if symmetrical encryption for confidentiality protection had become the basis of hashing and not SHA-256 integrity stamps. But I'm not sure if that would have worked well or not.

Base58check lets you make up phrases like that as long as the checksum at the end is right.
Maybe address utility will let you play around with that..
These custom word things are going to produce addresses where you don't know the private key and bitcoins sent to them will be lost
On the other hand, vanitygen is if you wanted a usable private key.  But it makes up random private keys and then tests if the public key is what you're looking for. It doesn't take long for short 4-6 character words but takes exponentially longer with each letter you're looking for.

In 140 years they can run on fees.
The fees are proportional to what people consider a modest expense in the world outside of bitcoin. So fees are going to be equivalent to extremely small purchasing power, like the price of probably two pieces of paper. But the block reward value is going to stay very high - but basically proportional to what the cost of reasonably up to date SHA256 hashing gear can be replaced out on an amortization + the cost of electricity. Miners that profit will be those with cheap electricity and/or excellent mining gear.
People don't have to pay high fees for bitcoin to be useful - or for miners to get rewarded - for at least 140 years... 
The fees just have to be high enough to slow spammers down. I think that because the stress tests didn't wear out too many bitcoins, I could make a reasonable argument that the fees are too low and should probably go back up to something like 0.0010 bitcoin instead of 0.0001 bitcoin.
But if we raise fees too much, people will seek a cheaper fee altcoin.

Bitcoin days destroyed captures the idea of money velocity somewhat and should be reflecting day to day use
Spikes in bitcoin days destroyed are usually the movements of huge values of bitcoin which were in cold storage
I liked this articles explanation - 
"The idea of "bitcoin days destroyed" came about because it was realised that total transaction volume per day might be an inappropriate measure of the level of economic activity in Bitcoin. After all, someone could be sending the same money back and forth between their own addresses repeatedly. If you sent the same 50 btc back and forth 20 times, it would look like 1000 btc worth of activity, while in fact it represents almost nothing in terms of real transaction volume."

I think that bitcoin days destroyed is a better thing to watch for coins in motion... you never know why coins are moving but at least bitcoin days destroyed isn't a number that could be artificially inflated. It's hard to tell if those coins are changing hands (in trade) or just moving between storage and wallets and back to storage though (without trading hands).

No and Yes.
No: Bitcoin itself will probably not change from a target blocktime of 10 minutes.
Also No: there's not a big security gain piling up lots of smaller blocks to get to 10 minutes. It's the amount of work that counts and that work gets deeper and deeper by time spent.
Possibly: I think it was Gavin's idea to pass around verified hashes of block headers and have the transactions and their sizes be a separate issue. So that the number of transactions in a block could scale. People feel right now that miners are incentive to pass around short blocks so that they have less chance of getting orphaned.
Yes-ish: if 2-way pegs to sidechains get made, then bitcoin could be pegged to an altcoin and that altcoin could have features like fast confirmation times.
Yes, but not exactly: a payment processor could take the risk of other transactions...
Yes but I don't understand it: petertodd has got a kind of pay to mine a second transaction which he claims would help - and this is the part I'm not quite understanding - helps somehow by showing how 0-confirmation transactions are very insecure, yet does something to secure it. He could explain.
Yes? - there was a wallet somewhere like Electrum or Mycelium which watches for transactions and ... because a lot of miners will see your first transaction and then relay it, a second transaction with same inputs (?) would not be relayed, as a double spend. And so they believe that you can show a rising confidence score ... 0%, 80%, 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99% in a few seconds. They may be wrong if petertodd is right that you can spend some things at one place, like SatoshiDice, and then send a doublespend somewhere else like to Eligius. But that's an example of a crafty way to create doublespends by exploiting what miners choose to NOT to mine. (Clever).
Maybe? The future might be a clever adoption of a new bitcoin, that's 2-way pegged to the original, and the new one would have more capabilities and do things like GHOST for processing blocks. And be extremely fast. Like 10-second blocks with great security. And people with old bitcoin gain the value of the existence of these new coins (unlike altcoin scamcoins), because the old bitcoin becomes the underlying, backing cryptocurrency.
My money would be on payment processors, some math like the Israeli GHOST paper, 2-way pegged sidechains, and tons more innovation.
Stick with bitcoin, it will overcome these problems. Everyone who has put time and effort into bitcoin is incentivized to see it succeed. It's not perfect now but it will grow and grow.

Not sure, I would expect Gresham's Law - bad money drives out good - to mean that people with thicker heavier purer coins hoarded them because they were actually worth more - but then everyday trade happened with cruddy coins.

It comes back around with less valuable taxes later (counted in coins) but you get this inflationary spiral going.

For a while things will grind, because right now a lot of people are engaged in completely useless tasks. Things will re-balance around projects with actual ROI. So that might mean that government, if it can't see into or affect your digital finances, it would mean that governments could just give that up and start taxing land ownership (land can't evade taxes).
And then, you might have to protect people's homes from random confiscation, but essentially you could make it so that people can force-buyout the ownership of commercial land (by offering to pay more in taxes for it) - kind of like eminent domain, but not affecting homes - or treating homes VERY special - and allowing companies to buy out each other's ownership of property at eye-watering rates. From there, someone can set up a toll road.
Everything will be fine, but pie in the sky / Greater Fool investment days would be over. Owing money in bitcoin would be financial stupidity or hubris. Making loans in bitcoin would also be dumb. So no loans, just private projects.
You could still come up with clear ROI on a lot of projects - like construction of tall buildings etc - but the risk would be really borne by the person fronting the money completely. It'd be a lot harder to do things with "other people's money".

Fractional reserve is dishonest if the people you store assets with have actually lent them out or even sold them or lost them, but whatever it was they were doing, putting those assets at risk and they didn't tell you that they were doing that, that would not be honest and ethical behavior.
Systemically, fractional reserve systems are fragile. If more assets have been lent out, and if economic conditions are such that the borrowers can't really pay bank the 'bank' doing the fractional reserve, and a rumor gets started, then the depositors will make a run on the bank, it collapses and savers lose. 
Some banks are very phony, and their books are garbage and they loan to friends and cronies and the thing teeters and collapses and not even the resources of the State can save it. (Search for stories on Bulgarian banks recently).
Between banks that don't engage in fractional reserve and those that do, the ones that do are more profitable as they play Russian Roulette with people's savings, and grow and grow, the ones taking the biggest calculated risks buying the safer banks. The big finance groups are impressively powerful. (Search: Squid on the Face of Humanity)
Eventually banks are too big to fail and depositor/voters get rightly pissed when they lose all. They set up regulation and social insurance (FDIC) to cover - socialize - bank losses on everyone else. They tax you and me to cover for their f-ups. FDIC honestly doesn't cost society that much. But the 2008 financial collapse sucked - collateralized debt obligations, badly marked up to AAA rated, swindled insurance giant AIG which died, Deutche Bank got screwed over hard, well anyway, it sucked, it was toxic. 
Now that said, lending and banking creates lots of interesting investments and industries.
But are we really benefiting that much by having a big student loan market, or does that just raise the price of college?
Do we really benefit from low interest housing loans, or does that just raise house prices, reward people that currently own homes and direct productive labor into housing and construction industries (roofing, painting, fixer uppers), which might honestly be a useless waste of everyone's time?
Is the lending situation creating a moral hazard (heads I win, tails you lose), a race to the bottom, a massive misallocation of capital?
Is the system evil? (Stupid and silly but I wouldn't say it's evil).
Banks do lots of good things. Definitely someone will come and add in a lot of the good things banks do. I'm just kind of feeling unhappy with them lately. I'm happy with my local Credit Union.

Yes, by your example everyone will switch to the lowest friction one - $0 to use 99.
I can also agree that if AmazonCoin comes out and they give a discount to use it or something, it will take off. Even if it's not a true cryptocurrency. Or even if it was really just bitcoin, renamed, with "A" addresses instead of a "1" at the beginning or something silly like that but otherwise was exactly 100% a bitcoin clone. /sigh 
And that's a good point you're making - how money, the bottom line, is a motivator. (Personally I think that means that bitcoins will trump fiat eventually, for just that reason - need to send value super cheap? very very very low fees? no interference? very little waiting? no take-backs? Bitcoin!) 
But it's good that you call me out - because I am just assuming, maybe with no good reason, that bitcoin will always be the lowest friction one, and it came first.
But I think that I do have a good reason. There's no really good reason to not use bitcoin and use an altcoin instead (right now).
I still think I'm correct in this and that first mover, even in something ephemeral like bitcoin software is still a very large advantage. And that something to come later has to be much much much better. 
All I see right now are a lot of altcoins eating litecoins lunch.
Only a transformatively better altcoin will have a chance of taking much of bitcoin's share. Like a DarkCoin, ZeroCoin with more privacy, or a sharded Bitcoin 2.0 that can process millions of transactions per second. Something like that.
Just my thoughts, I know that people will do what they must and some people definitely are covering their bases by watching the altcoin markets for a breakout somewhere. But I still think that the altcoins wear people out and eventually they give up and go back to bitcoin. The only winners it seems in altcoins are the devs which ride the initial wave in price. Hard for me to be idealistic about altcoins. I like altcoins as technical experiments but that's about it.

A key idea is that being short or long something does not necessarily have to have lots of leverage. 
If you keep a ratio of fiat to bitcoin, then you're going short and long with less risk.
If you short something, you could lose your whole investment if you get margin called. But as long as you're comfortable with that....

I don't know \-\-\- I've thought about it and if you had to "cash out" using bitcoin to buy real estate is not a bad way to go.
Seems like if you sell your bitcoin at Coinbase and do a wire transfer to a bank like Bank of America, you are pretty much risking getting the funds frozen and inaccessible. Maybe a lawsuit would open them, but ... doubtful? 
They would come up with some AML\\KYC reason why they think your wire is suspicious and if you did things like send $8000 a month \(a reasonable replacement for my salary if I lost my job\), they might think that's structuring.  
If you send it as one big wire, they might seize it, and you're even more in the hole.
If you really can buy real estate with bitcoin, then the sky's the limit. Yes, los Federales could seize the property, or IRS could I guess, but you could have your day in court at least, have some kind of appeal. 
I think bitcoin for real estate is a very interesting proposition. There's no middle man, and you get legal title. It's .... maybe not a bad idea!

The buyers don't have to care. But there will probably just not be as many coins for sale.
There are always still huge hoards which are already mined, those are still in the supply, but they might not be available for sale at a moment's notice on an exchange.
But it's possible that miners have to make a big sale monthly or every quarter or so and then miners do their best to get a good price.

Somewhat... the Police State will have a lot of control via guns and force over land and who gets to live and occupy a place. And they will have control and points of entry and exit and maybe be able to patrol roads and neighborhoods. Surveil communications systems. Infiltrate groups. etc.
So if we had a blockchain based colored coin system for car ownership, and say .... Toyota recognized "ownership" by whoever came to them controlling the colored coin, and based on that "ownership" you could have new keys made for your vehicle, etc...
So hypothetical future:
Then if someone owned and drove a Toyota 4-Runner from the USA (not a Police State) through Central and South America on a fun trip to Venezuela (Police State), they might find their car confiscated there on some bogus charge, and then the car could be bought/sold internally in that country, 
But at least as far as Toyota with colored coins was concerned, the original person is still the owner and could still get keys made for the car etc ;-)
The Police State is potentially physically all-powerful within it's own borders, but a paper tiger outside of that. It can confiscate physical goods, put people in cages or punish them in other ways, but once you are beyond their physical control (outside the Police State) - then it's more of a different problem. (Eg drone strikes or something).
Long story short: bitcoin does not protect you from the Police State. What good are numbers if they can not affect the way you live? You need a society where you aren't going to be captured and beaten with a 5 dollar wrench until you give up your 12 word seed.

Some people might think that by main currency you meant that a country would drop it's own currency for bitcoin, but you're not arguing that.
The other fellow cptmclain was wondering if bitcoin could become legal tender, and I just don't think so. Legal tender I thought meant that if someone owed you money and they offered legal tender, they *have* to take it for all debts public and private. But if you offer bitcoin, they're not under any obligation to accept that. That's the status quo situation and that's how I think things will be. I don't see legal tender in bitcoin's future at all anywhere.

No, wealthy people have their wealth in things that rise in price with inflation, or exceed the pace of dollar inflation.
Best, they own wealth whose value is notional (but very high) until they sell, like art and real estate.
But most would own stocks, or control companies by being in charge (even better than owning stock!)
Poor people live hand to mouth and can't get a leg up. The ladders get pulled up after them. However it was that most wealthy people succeed, they tend to make it so that follow-ons can't use the same ways to get rich. Doesn't have to be a conspiracy, it's just that by getting there first, wealthy people can out compete new entrants and set up regulations etc to keep newcomers out.

Something I don't understand about two way pegs, is how they're done -
a) does a dev team for an altcoin simply state "we have funded our altcoin with a backing of 1.0 bitcoin. We are issuing 1000 altcoins. Each altcoin is worth 0.001 bitcoins. Let us know if you want to cash out, and we'll buy our altcoin back from you and cash you out. Thanks."
or ...
b) Via some kind of peg mechanism, if someone gets ahold of their altcoins, they can make a corresponding bitcoin transaction that reimburses them ? Do the altcoins have to go to an AltcoinEaterAddress over there? How does the main bitcoin chain go look over at some altchain for proof? Confused.
c) do you use something like SSSS to split things up - take your bitcoin 1.0 backing, split it into 1000 pieces, each 0.001 bitcoin - then make altcoin units as many as you want - and let the solution to them be one of the keys back to a secret sharing scheme and then pay for script hash unlocks 0.001 bitcoin? (and the altcoin watches bitcoin and destroys/eats a corresponding amount of altcoin?)
So lost. Not sure how to implement this without changing bitcoin. Is that possible?

It might only take 2-3x the number of people wanting bitcoin to make it's price go up 10x
Any time that there is just more buyers than sellers by volume, price goes up to temper demand. 
But the price is very nominal and can fall quickly if it goes up really fast and people hit their price points and cash out.
That said, quickly rising prices draw in speculators who hope for ever increasing price.
The effect can wind up and unwind very very fast.

I wish that the hash algorithm itself had been more flexible, so that we could choose to use something that used hardware that more people could get ahold of..
It seems right now that things are mainly in these three camps
* CPUs : which encourages bot net farms unfortunately
* GPUs : which make gamers mad at miners, by making GPUs scarce
* FPGA/ASIC : which really reward those with the capital to sink into huge ASIC farms, fab their own chips, etc.
On the balance, I would prefer something that was both heavy CPU and heavy GPU. Not something you could botnet, but both together. So it would require a large mining farm to scale, but it would all be commodity gear. Not something you'd find on office desktops, or on a gamer PC. Though a gamer PC - with a better CPU - would be an ideal starting point, or could be.
I wish Satoshi had done that instead of not tackling ASICs at all :/

Not perfect, but the closest analogy I can think of off the top of my head:
Imagine an even number. Let's pretend that's your private key. Now add one (odd number) Let's pretend that's your public key. To generate this, you didn't have to connect a computer to the Internet. You could give me your public key (say, "11") and I could send it money. Then you could use your private key ("10") and send the money again.
It's a stupid example obviously, for many reasons, because there is actually a limit to the number of valid public/private keypairs for bitcoin, and because it's so trivial for me to figure out your private key in my made up odd-number/even-number public/private key generation system. But the point is, with bitcoin it's a somewhat similar idea.
First, there aren't an infinite number of possible addresses, but it's a huge number. And you can generate them offline, and there's just an extremely extremely small chance that you and I could ever come up with the same private key.
The private keys which get generated and the public keys which go with them, I think are generated with elliptic curve cryptography. The randomness would come from a pool of entropy. You could get that by rolling dice, wiggling a mouse, entering some data at a keyboard, listening to a diode or a random atomic decay off a geiger counter, whatever. The public key is further cloaked by not revealing the actual key, but the hash of the key (ripemd-160, then sha256 twice, something like that) 
Obligatory:  is a joke site that has all the private keys to bitcoin and their corresponding calculated public key. :) The directory is IMMENSE, you would never finish looking at all the keys.

@_date: 2014-06-03 16:29:14
There are some really odd calculations around fees. Apparently the original code made it so that you could send really old coins with no fees and get good priority. Somewhere along the way .0005 was the default fee, and now in the new client .0001 bitcoin is the default fee. It seems like miners are starting to just not bother with transactions that don't have a fee. A 0-fee transaction might get confirmed, eventually. But it can also be resent with a fee and that probably would get confirmed fairly quickly.

From the Wikipedia article about IPv6 under privacy:
"It is not a requirement for IPv6 hosts to use address auto-configuration, however. Yet, even when an address is not based on the MAC address, the interface's address is globally unique, in contrast to NAT-masqueraded private networks. Privacy extensions for IPv6 have been defined to address these privacy concerns,[30] although Silvia Hagen describes these as being largely due to "misunderstanding".[31] When privacy extensions are enabled, the operating system generates random host identifiers to combine with the assigned network prefix. These ephemeral addresses are used to communicate with remote hosts making it more difficult to track a single device.[32]
Privacy extensions are enabled by default in Windows (since XP SP1), OS X (since 10.7), and iOS (since version 4.3).[33][34] Some Linux distributions have enabled privacy extensions as well.[35]
Privacy extensions do not protect the user from other forms of activity tracking, such as tracking cookies."

Probably, the ETFs are being put forward by more deep-pocketed groups and will be approved.
This warning is probably for groups like Havelock and the Neo&amp;Bee debacle, and maybe digital currencies themselves.  Or that Romanian fellow that pushed back against the SEC, I think that was Bitcoin exchange MPEx, and it was about the sale of Satoshi Dice or something.
Depending on your views you could consider all digital currencies scams, or all of them but bitcoin, or all of them but bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin, and on and on.
Or you might see digital currencies as okay, but the bitcoin-denominated stocks as shady, or at least even more risky than just bitcoin.
They are just going to say something really conservative and I think it's reasonable to assume that their view is that all of the bitcoin denominated unregulated stocks are shady and they don't want people to invest in them.
And I think that the SEC assumes that if a stock is touted to US citizens that it would fall under their regulation. That's an interesting stance and it might be true?
I thought this other article they linked to was good too -  
And I don't own any of these bitcoin stocks, but here's a quick idea I think of how the SEC sees their role from this laymans guide they published:
(or OTC) market
These companies generally have not
registered with the SEC, and they publish
information based solely on foreign
requirements, including different
accounting and auditing policies. The
OTC market is much less liquid than
other U.S. securities markets, so it may
be difficult to execute trades at favorable
prices. Most foreign companies trading
in the OTC market have not registered
with the SEC. These companies may not
let U.S. shareholders participate in
offerings of new shares, such as ìrightsî
offers to existing shareholders, because
that would require SEC registration."
I'm pretty sure that the Romanian fellow who runs MPEx could care less what the SEC thinks. I would have assumed that only Romanian regulations or laws applied to running his exchange. But, maybe hypothetically a US citizen that got hurt financially could appeal to a jurisdiction somewhere in Federal Court for relief. See if he ever gets paid though. Hence, this warning from the SEC.

Yeah you could have a payment processor like Coinbase or BitPay just take the alt.
It can be more economical for a payment processor to process quite a few altcoins.
A merchant who doesn't use a payment processor to code it themselves and not get scammed and also have to explain using the system to employees (or not):
A merchant might accept 0 cryptocurrencies (right now the majority of merchants dont take any), or 1 - bitcoin is an obvious first choice, or 2 - like bitcoin+litecoin, or bitcoin+dogecoin, or take 3-10 currencies and get good with multiple wallets, or go berserk and like Cryptsy support 100s.
A payment processor could reasonably take 3-10 different currencies because they can afford the programming and to stay on top of the liquidity issues. But if the currencies are different enough from each other, it gets complicated to track and do it correctly - and I mean 100% correctly - or else like Mt Gox you get looted and can't quite explain how it all happened.
So I think there's room out there for sure for a processor to offer 3-10 alts and take that business on. (There certainly already is one right?)

I would have said, "Bitcoin doesn't have to escape anything, like an association with drugs. It's about financial freedom. The Feds now are pretty sure they have a handle on things and they can take down Silk Road like sites with old-fashioned detective work: follow the packages with drugs in them. So bitcoin sleuthing isn't really the difficult part of the job. So moving on, what makes bitcoin great is that it is headed towards bigger and better and more mainstream purposes. Looking forward to the bitcoin ETFs."

The article reads like "ELI5 for Central Bankers: how is bitcoin really any different from e-money?"
I think it's interesting how they seemed to be freaking out that bitcoins could be used to buy M-PESA phone minutes:
4	 The article claimed that Kipochi (a Kenya-based Bitcoin wallet accessible via mobile phones) launched a product that allowed people
   in Africa to send and receive Bitcoins. Several statements in the article were misleading. It referred to Kipochi as being able to â€œconvert
   [Bitcoins] to and from the Kenya currency M-PESAâ€ (Spaven 2013). M-PESA is not a Kenyan currency, but simply a service that allows users
   to send e-money through an e-money account accessed through the mobile phone. M-PESA is not affiliated with Bitcoin, and there is no
   integration of the systems. Safaricom does not permit the sale and purchase of Bitcoins using M-PESA."
...almost like they deeply feared an untraceable "leak" from bitcoin into M-PESA, and that they talk about buying bitcoins with USD, EUR and KES .... (Kenyan Shillings). 
So there might be a subtext there that the bitcoin to M-PESA link is under close close scrutiny for some reason. Not sure why....
Also the tone makes it sound like .... bitcoin is not very anonymous at all and as long as users use domestic brokers and exchanges (eg Coinbase), then the bitcoins can be very easily tracked and the identities of the users worked out. Which I of course already know but the way they play that out comes across as kind of Orwellian, as if knowing every little purchase made by the herds is super super super important.

Come on man, it takes more than 3 years to download the blockchain on a 1200 baud modem! So if you think I'm going to upgrade equipment that's worked great since ... God knows when, you're mistaken!

You need to get the blockchain down to about 100 bytes.

But yes it was very exciting to switch from 400 baud, to 1200, to 9600, to 14.4, to 28.8, and then DSL; for me it would take about a day to download the current blockchain.

Since you put it in bold, you might mean something other that what I'd mean by the word leverage --
At exchanges like OKcoin 796.com and Bitfinex you can do leverage (shorts / long) with bitcoin (and fiat), the multiples vary, between 10x and 3x. That's not like forex in the big pairs like USD/EUR where you can get 100x, but it's still a multiple.
That's a big difference between now and last year. Last year you could kind of get leverage depending where you look, but now it seems to be a lot more common on exchanges.
But it's still mostly true that you can't directly use bitcoins to get a home loan, the way you can leverage a small down payment.
Is that what you meant?

I didn't mean to offend you. Maybe the term is unconsciously racist?? It certainly wasn't meant to be so.
(There are other models of capitalism described in that)
No racism is implied by the term - but obviously it paints whole countries with a broad brush, culturally, and it's clearly not true that everyone in a given country feels the same way about their local market operations.
Anyway, about Anglo-Saxon capitalists, it's not necessarily a good or bad model. The United States seems to have a really dynamic business environment, but other countries have legal systems where you have to assume something is not legal if it's not explicitly allowed.
(When I was growing up - I just assumed that businesses would never do edgy things like skirt the spirit of the law and regulations. As I get older, I see that businesses in the US routinely come up with business models that would on their face seem to be illegal - eg Napster. And there could be eventual consequences, but you could get to be a billion dollar company before the axe falls. So interesting.
I wonder if this clash of business styles is why people like Kim DotCom left Germany for places like NZ to start MEGA etc. 
My dad in Germany has told me bits about how a relative there was getting business loans and things like that and when their enterprise folded, they were pretty much barred from starting a new business. I didn't follow, but boy you get the sense overall that there are Rules upon Rules in Germany, and overall a level of management and planning that people in the USA are completely unfamiliar with. 
In the USA, if you declared bankruptcy, there's this understanding that that's how Capitalism goes sometimes. Good ideas don't always pan out or execute well. 
But in Germany, apparently, if you make mistakes and go out of business, the investors pretty much get to block you from future business until you pay them back. Or something like that. It sounded very very different.
Anyway, that's an example of a cultural difference between Anglo-Saxon capitalism and Rhine capitalism.

I'm assuming that it's freaking horrible news for US based miners of large size, like the one in Eastern Washington.
I just can't imagine or see the logic of mined bitcoin being worth anything until they're sold.
It forces miners, I think, to sell mined bitcoins immediately. And to restructure so that losses/gains are born by investors instead of the miner themselves. 
What a mess.

Do you think it's possible that they did something wacky with game theory and came up with a distributed blockchain with no mining rewards and made individual nodes in their system into lightweight miners? Something weird like that? With centralized checkpoints so that if someone disturbs their system they can go back? I wonder what they really built.

~~Setting aside the coarseness of the block time -~~
~~The main idea is that once a transaction has been mined into a block, the deeper in time it goes the harder it should be to reverse.~~
~~So security wise I think 60 1 minute blocks and 6 10 minute blocks are giving the same security. (Correct me if I'm wrong).~~
~~But the problem is, as you shave blocktimes down, you increase the chance of another part of the network finding a different solution to the mined blocks. Another part of the network could see a slightly different list of transactions too, so it's not like they found an alternate answer, they were in a sense mining a slightly different problem.~~
~~If they had more work done on their side, then you've wasted that lucky mining effort. It's not a calamity, but kind of disruptive.~~
~~The chance of it happening under normal circumstances is probably something like the propagation time over the network in seconds divided by the block time chosen in seconds.~~
~~I do personally wonder why blocktimes weren't made to be 1 minute or even 10 seconds, but maybe clients that only use headers would wind up seeing proportionally more data.~~

And, they have the gall to both know that these are private banks, and that they are allowed to lean on sovereign backing and loot the tax payers when they distribute the wealth to their crony friends to their own advantage.

And soon you have the most terrible altcoin I can imagine, with the caveat that it has a massive "market cap".

Depends on what you mean by a charity but if you meant an IRS-recognized tax deductable one, sure why not?
What I would do is think about how charities are evaluated by groups like the Better Business Bureau - they have standards for Charities and they have some clear criteria they use to decide what makes a charity worthwhile and well run (if I recall, 20 clear points - everything from administration to fund raising).
I think that if the charity is well-organized and can meet some clear criteria for accountability, it might not be a bad place to fund.

Part of the answer comes from people thinking about spam.
There was this floating idea that maybe one could stop spammers by putting a small fee on email, like postage, or some other way to let someone pay you to jump to the front of their email inbox, or some minimum threshold they have to pay in order to get into your inbox at all.
Once people thought about it for a while they realized they just needed the senders to pay and they didn't necessarily have to receive anything.
One way to make spammers "pay" is to hold them up by making them do a calculation that takes about a minute to compute per email. Then they can't send millions of emails so easily. They could still try to get botnets and so on, but you could cut spam way down, so goes the thought. So they thought of a hashing system. Something where you hash the contents of the mail - takes a lot of CPU to compute compared to the CPU to check that it's correct. The next idea is to come up with a "difficult" hash. One way of course would be to hash it 1000 times, or a million times. Another way would be to make the hash beat a difficulty threshold. Like you could require that the hash begin with a zero - "0" or two zeroes "00" or three "000" ....
Of course not all CPUs are equal, and spammers still have botnets. 
And me personally, it looks like the spam situation isn't as out of control as people thought, and also - I felt like back in the day that email was never ready for prime time but people loved it. I would have had whitelisted mail servers and whitelisted senders, but other people loved the idea of having email be spontaneous and they loved having old friends connect and send them an email at random out of the blue without having to do a lot of permissions or strict identity checking.
So these ideas - Proof of Work ideas - were floating out there already before bitcoin.
Bitcoin came up with this idea of a distributed ledger, but used Proof of Work to tie it together, give miners a block reward (and fees) to check that the transactions are correct .... and the rest is history.

Well ... it's wacky, pretend you're the car company and you just want cash, and on the other side, you have this customer that wants to pay using a strange and volatile currency (or something odd, like gold).
Pretend what looks like it's matching up really well is a 2 year payment schedule, with 24 ounces of gold as collateral. At the end of the loan, if the gold has gone up in value, some remainder of gold is transferred back to the seller, and if gold has gone down in value, the buyer is on the hook for the rest.
This person wants that same setup, but with monthly targets, and using bitcoin instead of gold. 
If the thing they were buying was worth a lot of money, like .... a 777 jet, and the buyer was a Kuwaiti with a TON of gold they could put up as collateral, then a deal could be reached.
But we're talking about a really inexpensive car and bitcoins. So naturally, people aren't as keen to haggle out these sort of complicated contracts yet for such low stakes.

From the paper: "the set of transactions transactions in a new block (call that set "B") and the set of transactions that a node already knows about (call that set "P")."
Does IBLT make testing the difference between B and P (the set B-P) go up linearly or does it stay the same for basically a very long time?
So if B-P are about 1% apart, and B goes from 10 transactions to 100, and P goes from 9 to 99, then the difference goes from 1 to 10. So that went up linearly, O(n).
But if IBLT only takes logarithmically longer to figure out what's missing, like quicksort, then whether B or P is 10, 100, 1000, as long as comparing the differences is blazing fast, and the same basic cost, then I think it goes up O(log n), but I'm not sure.

Good for you!
You can assume that in the early days of VISA they had people go around and just ask 'Do you accept VISA?' and that they had a vested interest in it as salespeople to ask.
As the network effects start to rise, not only will some shops spontaneously start taking a payment system, but people will ask because they forgot cash (the alternate payment system).
Eventually, if a new 'money' is better it starts to have fairly ubiquitous acceptance.

The problem you're imagining is how does bitcoin become the 'unit of account' - the currency that prices are quoted in.
Well it won't happen until bitcoin prices become very very stable relative to other goods. 
It honestly might never happen :/  Bitcoin is very volatile, more volatile than the price of gold, and gold is pretty much revered as a store of value (by some people) - but most people I think look for dollars, Treasury bills, overnight deposit rates, LIBOR, Swiss francs, and other things as "better" store of value than gold, but depends on your perspective. Dollars have the Fed behind them, smoothing things out constantly, making speculation their future value doable (forex) but not easy money (imho) - so since dollars value doesn't appear to everyday people to move much, and because everyone around you is floating on dollars - wages paid in dollars, debts priced in dollars, groceries and gasoline priced in dollars, it appears to not move as much as it really is jumping and falling in value relative to other currencies. Which by the way, are continuously jostling around in value in a beggar-the-neighbor / least-dirty-shirt kind of way. Fiat currencies really suck, except maybe for Swiss francs which are partly gold-backed.
Bitcoins have to be hoarded as a store of value, used as a medium of exchange at least as widely as VISA, and then people might start to price things in bitcoin.
Also bitcoin would have to close the loop - suppliers paid in bitcoins, goods sold for bitcoins, workers given wages in bitcoins, contracts settled in bitcoins, it would have to be very routine.
That's probably a ways off, maybe never, but maybe it will happen.

Look, I get the main idea that for an equal price, should you have gold/bitcoin, or a factory/arable land, that you would be better off with the factory/arable land, because they produce something and eventually you could use the profits to buy the gold/bitcoin.
But as a means of exchange, bitcoin the techology is just amazing. And I think that because of the network effect probably just the top 2 or 3 cryptocurrencies by market value are going to be universal enough to get a network effect going. Most sites are going to take 0, 1, 2, 3, or 10+ currencies in a long tail. 
There's so much potential growth here in bitcoin's price... there will also unfortunately be a lot of regulation and scrutiny. Because bitcoin is the biggest, it will get the most attention and adoption (for good and bad). People will probably use altcoins more and more for pump and dumps and scams. There are plenty of problems to come, but cool rewards too I think.

Funny you should mention - just today our CTO was talking about the threat of hacks to Intel microcode. I assume Intel has to digitally sign the updates but sure the NSA would get a key.
"Detailed Description
The microcode data file contains the latest microcode definitions for all Intel processors. Intel releases microcode updates to correct processor behavior as documented in the respective processor specification updates. While the regular approach to getting this microcode update is via a BIOS upgrade, Intel realizes that this can be an administrative hassle. The Linux Operating System and VMware ESX products have a mechanism to update the microcode after booting. For example, this file will be used by the operating system mechanism if the file is placed in the /etc/firmware directory of the Linux system. "
Anyway, point being, if they don't like how your software behaves, then change the microcode in the CPU to do something different... I would bet that microcode can't do *THAT*, 
....But when you hear that Android phone gyroscopes can be used as microphones, I am not even mad. I am impressed.

Not really.
In an inflationary system:
Poor people tend to have to spend currency almost as fast as they can get it. Rich people invest in things that will rise in price with inflation. In general, everyone is encouraged to take on debts and hope that they speculate successfully and find things to spend that debt on that improve their situation (education, home, car, stocks and bonds). But fairly overwhelmingly, rich people are getting rich for having taken just about no risk.
In a deflationary system, poor people who have money in cash find that that cash is gaining value if they don't spend. So they are suddenly in much the same position as rich people. Rich people are stuck in a new world where lending is not as good an idea, so they have to come up with actual breakthrough products and ideas to fund, not tiny innovations. 
These are my opinions.

I think the seed starts somewhere and makes new addresses until it finds some you haven't used yet. Then stops there and lets you use those before making more.

No, it should still be O(1).
The transactions are already in the miners mempool. They are already transmitted to the miner when the miner heard them chirping on the network. When a block solution in the new proposed format arrives -- the miner has to check the hash in the header really fast against transactions which are already present in the miner's RAM.

Maybe a RES tag thing that says (this person has sent tips via ChangeTip, so they could be open to receiving them?)
The problem is that part of the spam of changetip is the social context of being seen to tip, receiving the acknowledgement, sharing that it's okay to tip, how to tip.. it's just all snafu'd kind of..
I like the private tipping, less spammy, but more I wish that we could just have bitcoin addresses if we wanted (stealth addresses ideally, or something like that) and get a message with a stealth address tip. That'd be neat :-)
Or a stealth address 'signature' where ChangeTip could spot your account and sig and make it so that people could see that you do see and use ChangeTip ...

Oh it's not a bad thing for China, it's just how life is sometimes. Ideas which need big communities (the network effect) to get going, the smart people just quickly build their own version of it and jump start it themselves in the local language rather than wait for outsiders to profit and lock everyone into their social network system.

You might know: do Mastercoin transactions look different? Like go to and from some known bitcoin addresses that are related to Mastercoin?

Well Europe is way ahead in other ways right, like having whole streets and areas like that spot in Berlin, which take bitcoin more like a functional economy.
Plus Bitstamp is in Europe and they have lots of innovation.
Also, maybe there's less pressure to replace banks because it sounds like lots of things that bitcoin is good at, like transferring money between accounts, happens pretty fast and happily amongst europeans.

Well breaking your question up into two pieces ...
Second half - intrinsic value - traditionally people think that gold has intrinsic value by example. But value is assigned as Piper67 suggests below. I'll give an example: which has more intrinsic value: a parachute or a bar of gold? It's a bit situational. Are you jumping from a plane? Are you trying to leave wealth to your heirs in a form they can understand? A five year old knows that gold is valuable, bitcoins are more difficult to explain and a piece of paper with an extremely valuable backup on them could easily be tossed in the trash.
First part of your question, could you make an altcoin that was a bit of a scam where you don't really have a valuable network or anything like that, just some weird happenstance of buyer/seller that has created a very artificial valuation. Isn't that something that has happened already to an altcoin called Quark? I think I heard somewhere it was a premine, so the coin value is kind of a fantasy value.
@_date: 2014-10-02 05:48:29
 &gt; Why is it an advantage, that the money supply is fix?
Well, it's not a disadvantage, from the point of view of a single person. 
All things being equal, you'd rather hold as savings a currency that inflated less than other currencies. Also interesting is a currency where you knew the future rate of production. Bitcoin is odd that way in that it's built into the social structure and source code of bitcoin to have bitcoins come out at a very targeted rate. Not even the Fed can do that - hold themselves to an algorithm.
Anyway, currency-wise, if you were paid in Argentinian Pesos, and you could easily trade straight over to US dollars, you would want to do that in order to preserve your purchasing power while you decide what to spend your value on (if what you wanted was basic liquid savings).
Anyway, just being rare or having a known fixed quantity is not enough. Also it's not enough that bitcoins are almost completely counterfeit proof. But those kinds of attributes, plus a really big user base that accepts them as payments, and you can judge for yourself if you think bitcoins (the currency value) will go up or down. Or if you just want to use them to buy things or as a way to do remittances etc.

Well, for better or worse, any system of accounting that doesn't actually account for the value held by all the players is going to get replaced.
To the degree that the powers that be, right or wrong, put pressure on other powers, those alternate centers of power (like the BRICs and their wealthy elite) will seek alternatives.
Not necessarily in bitcoin, but in something. Bitcoin is a nice hedge to political dollar power plays 
(Justified power plays or whatever, but it's politics and I can't blame the US for trying, but it's clearly not going to work forever, however justified they think it is, or it actually is).

The genius of this is that when you send out a block with a header and a bunch of transactions in it -- the other node probably already knows 99% of the transactions that'll be in that block.
You can pass along the header and enough information so that the nodes receiving it probably already can confirm for themselves which transactions you're including. The receiving nodes already saw bitcoin transactions being broadcasted so they already have them in their memory. 
Something to sort out is a canonical ordering of transactions. But after that...
As long as you include most of the transactions ... (or something silly like an empty block)
Then the IBLT helps you know very quickly if you're missing one or two transactions and you can confirm those, then be sure the block is valid, etc.
Turns out there was already a high-speed miner's backbone doing something like this about a month before Gavin mentioned an IBLT idea.

It is has a fee, it can be seen by the whole network pretty quickly - just a few seconds, and there's no logical reason to believe it won't get confirmed.
A double-spend would probably have to add a bigger fee? Hmm.
I see in other people's explanations that the double-spend coming next would be ignored. (But I thought you could un-stick a transaction that had 0 fees by adding a fee and re-sending?)

The trippy thing about bitcoin is that you can make as many addresses as you want, even off line -
They don't get taken (have bitcoins in them by having some on the blockchain) until someone sends them some bitcoin :)
It's similar to something like this, imagine a number from one to a million. Okay put that onto a piece of paper. Okay now I'll send the number that's on a piece of paper some bitcoins. You could just make up numbers in your head over and over.
Bitcoin is like that, but the number of addresses is collossally larger, and by "piece of paper" I meant the blockchain.

Don't hold bitcoins then.

That's true, that's the gold advantage. It's literally elemental.
Offtopic - found out the other day that the cap on the Washington Monument is aluminum. Apparently once upon a time aluminum was so hard to smelt that it was far more valuable than gold. Capping the Washington Monument with it was a way of showing off wealth and power. But some process was invented that makes it so common now that we have aluminum foil.
Gold is still rare, but some people think you could mine asteroids for gold and valuable metals and that it might become common. I give that a .00001% chance of happening ;) (eg, very very unlikely in my lifetime, but way more likely than me winning the Lottery.)

Loved the article.
Sorry I don't have links - but I thought I'd read that Blockchain.info really does price employee contracts in bitcoin. Retention (or at least morale) might be a problem when bitcoin tanks.
Yep, I'm pretty sure that for marketing purposes the whole deal at their company is in bitcoin completely.
It's also possible that (Roger Ver?) is super bitcoin wealthy and by using bitcoin at the company (it's privately held, yes?) that the bitcoin could be something other than funds and more like company inventory in some way. Not sure.
Call a clever accountant! :) Anyway, my bet is that their logic is - if PayPal isn't a bank - then Blockchain.info DEFINITELY isn't a bank. So the regulators can lay off.
It's definitely a bit odd to use bitcoin as your unit of account inside a business when that's not how the rest of the world uses it. But maybe there's something odd about how things are structured that makes this a hilariously amazingly great idea somewhere. Like "Hollywood Accounting", but bitcoin style.

Good article. Takes the wind out of your sails a little bit. I don't own a business so I can't say 'Bitcoin accepted here' or I would. 
It goes to show how even a few little places here and there that take bitcoin can really help.
But in some ways it was a sad experience that shows it's hard to take off and get the network effect rolling.
Hopefully next year is better.
And it would be interesting to make a coverage map of interlocking things people need - from essentials like utility bills, rent, house purchases, food like groceries and restaurants and coffee shops and bars, clothing (that can probably be ordered), ... and it's also obvious that Gift cards are a big big deal for being able to use bitcoin if you have some, but it insulates the merchants from realizing that there are bitcoin-holding customers out there... 
Something like Square taking bitcoin by default would be transformative. Hard to say, they probably just add in whatever their merchant customers want.

I think bitcoin right now is in a wiggle-room area, where it's not very good for super small purchases like coffees because of technical things like 10 minutes to a confirmation (debatable if that's important for coffee) and political things like every spend being a taxable event to the IRS.
Then it's also simultaneously too small to be able to buy and sell basketball teams with enough liquidity.
I dunno, crypto currencies aren't there yet but I wouldn't call them a failure.
It's bigger than the M2 money supply of some very small countries, and their currencies aren't any more useful for some of these things but I think bitcoin has more potential.

Maybe a graph of independent IP addresses, separated by latency, with a reward for low latency and high bandwidth.
Some way to prove that things are spread out very very widely, but still fast.
If the rewards scheme is worked out, it would be more profitable to have one mining center in China and another in New York, than to have one center in Iceland, because your miners are spread out. No point faking the latency, because most miners aren't and there's no reward for being slow. If we're all fiber connected then speed of light is the fastest we could ever get to and we could measure and make fast high-bandwidth routes to reward miners or retransmitters along the path. 
Maybe to do it imagine a grid of spread out points across the Earth, use a truncated icosahedron or similar to start - like a Dymaxion map - give a mining reward per area that decays a little if it goes uncollected, but continuously has more piling on. Make part of the reward be the propagation speed to the rest of the network - measures the time going out the different sides of triangles (would be neat if it could be squares for a simple north/east/south/west route around the world for measuring latency, but ... triangles will do) and in this proposal - each miner claims to be in one of the 20 triangles around the world - or a sub sub sub triangle if we want - and then at random a whole batch of miners all latency test each other and the believability of a given location is taken into question. And some kind of reward for being spread out applied.

Where he was paying employees the face value of gold and silver - 
Apparently the IRS thinks it's Kahre's fault that although a Quarter says it's worth 25 cents (and four of them make a dollar) - that a Gold Coin made by the US Mint which says it's worth 50 dollars right on it (one of them makes fifty pieces of paper) - that instead the market value of the underlying gold makes it worth something like 1250 pieces of paper. It's so asinine. 
It would be funny if the US Mint minted absolutely microscopic little gold coins that matched the value of the gold's value at the time of their face value.

Once the Mycelium Entropy device is out ... do you have a way to embed "values" or strings by letting someone print a circuit?
Even if not maybe someone could put a watch address into the USB and when they plug it in find out the balance on the blockchain...
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:47:03
Well sometime in the not too far future you'll have thumbnail sized computers with the power of my desktop computer.
They'll cost a dollar, come in cereal boxes and not have enough storage for the bitcoin blockchain.
But a pretty typical desktop PC will be able to hold the whole blockchain pretty easily.
Your cell phone would probably be able to hold some of it, but not everything like the mempool, unconfirmed transactions etc.
It would have access to computers that it could choose to trust that would have everything though.
It'd be nice if the whole blockchain could fit on a future cell phone but that might not happen.

I like your line of reasoning.
I think there's already a distinction in the credit card industry, some kind of acronym like CNP? (card not present?) - something like that. The credit card industry is already aware that there's a whole class of credit card fraud that's done without the card physically present (online).
With the Chip and Pin system coming to USA, in person credit card fraud hopefully will drop off. But I can imagine that online fraud will expand. 
Eventually, probably, the online fraud side of credit cards will start to slowly rise.... and bitcoin transactions not being fraudulent will start to look better and better for merchants...

That said, they seem to be a Stripe-integrated Ripple-like system and not exactly an altcoin.
I wish that Stripe had just purchased a million in bitcoin and said - "we now have a war chest and have the ability to float and have a little bit of financial slack inside the bitcoin economy - not a lot, a million dollars only buys less than 2000 bitcoins on today's open markets, but enough to get going" -- but among groups with a lot of money, there are many that don't want to make bitcoin early adopters wealthy, so out of jealousy/spite, they are going to throw good money down the toilet advancing dead ends.
Just my two satoshis...
They might be an interesting system. Not sure. Just seems like a gateway coin.

Oh that's interesting, I didn't realize the little circular buttons were clickable.

But more opaque because we don't know the volumes and technically a lot like the bitcoin blockchain we don't know the why - we don't know if those are purchases of goods/services from merchants or if those are bitcoin purchases or sales by customers. Oh well. Still neat to see rising volume. :)

Some miners are making a profit, sure. They need cheap electricity, suppliers that ship good products on time, a decent plan to grow, the ability to probably turn over equipment about every 2-3 months, and if they have a datacenter - a reasonable business climate and political climate.
Finding innovative financial ways to put some of these risks onto other people is smart too - like selling hashrate to speculators.
It's a lot to get right. If you miss out, the mining rig costs become a sunk cost and then the miners work to make as many bitcoins as they can with it until difficulty makes the ROI slip away from them.

I thought the nodes wouldn't relay a duplicate?
But it sounds like different mining pools can have their own 'submit your raw transaction here' web pages and you could privately submit a transaction to a miner?
I was hoping they would relay those transactions, then see incoming a spend of the same inputs but with a lower fee, and (I thought) a miner would mine neither transaction? A greedy miner could play dumb and just mine the one with the bigger transaction. If miners undercut the fair play rules of the system we might never know if they are doing that, but they're still knaves ;)

Yeah - and what's interesting about it, if you've never heard of it, is that you can lend in $25 dollar amounts, to borrowers which are looking to borrow some amount like $10000 or $13000 or something like that for credit-card refinance, home improvement, etc.
What I've learned is that the scammers (there aren't many, about 1%) will consolidate their 54 credit cards into one big pile, refinance through lending club, and then flush all the debt down the toilet like 4 months later by declaring bankruptcy. Arggghhhh.....
So, it will sound mean, but all the ones that did this were from CA or FL. So I never lend to people from those states now. There is something culturally broken about those places.
Anyway, hypothetically you could get 10 to 15% returns but it just takes one loan going bad and you're looking at 2-3% returns. 
Good learning experience though! If banks didn't have fractional reserve lending, they'd actually have to work for a living ;-)

You have discovered the Impossible Trinity in pegged altcoins. ;)
If you have a fixed exchange rate to and from bitcoin, and you decentralize how people can cash into and out of bitcoin and the altcoin, then you don't have the ability to make up an independent monetary policy (like gifting yourself free money) -- well maybe the altcoin could be a scam with a backdoor that does let you loot the value.
If you centralize it, so that people have to go through some kind of clearing house, then you can make the "peg" float around, but then it's not directly convertible (people have to find out from somebody central what it's "worth" - could be a group, could be a set of market makers, could be the developers, proof of stake, what-have-you) and you become an easily attackable target for regulators and control freaks.

Yes, exactly. The rules that make them taxed now, to be not taxed later, could be amended or asterisked in some way. Like you could have an epic bailout and Congress could pass a law, and declare that some emergency fund needs your money.
All of these things right now are kind of gentleman's agreements. This is because corporations have gotten away with looting pensions, cities like Detroit ran their finances into the ground and screwed public sector pensions (rightly, wrongly, depending on how you see that), and eventually they will come after private sector style 401(k) and public 403(b) - Roth or not, there's no particular reason to spare anyone's piggybank.

Right, so say this part is correct and they saw a real IP address, not something cloaked by Tor, and they trivially worked out that it's located in Iceland. 
Now, the most reasonable thing - is it to assume that the person running the site ... has to obey the laws of Iceland? And then, it's this unknown group or persons who admin Silk Road - do you even know they are US citizens at this point? You could choose to believe they're not US citizens (does that give them less rights? Not sure if "secure in their persons" applies to US citizens or not, especially if overseas, but if they're not US citizens and not doing whatever it is we think is illegal in the US, does our jurisdiction apply? Assume yes I guess, they're not US, the server isn't in the US, but yes our jurisdiction applies, hmm. This is quite a stretch at some point isn't it??  I mean, flip it around - if Russia chases crimes to a US data center in Santa Clara, can they kick in the door, seize the server? Whose laws and jurisdictions apply?)
Why not have the national police of Iceland seize the server? Or Interpol or something?

@_date: 2014-10-27 16:24:22
There's different ways to split this argument up.
One is to say that yes you're absolutely right and that no one should ever ever ever consider a 0-confirmation spend to be secure. And if you add a feature (I forget the exact name) - but I think it's "replace by fee" - you could double-spend with a tiny higher fee and that would replace your first, unconfirmed spend. Peter Todd supports that and he is smart and has reasons.
Next, you could use another service that does m-of-n signatures or something the merchant themselves make up. That would be that you and the merchant jointly sign a transaction, like a 2-of-2. And they're not going to 'undo' your spend, and you don't have their key. The merchant has to remember to put a tiny fee on it, or else it really might not confirm for a long long time for small amounts of bitcoin spent...
A company like BitPay insures the merchant against the risk... 
Or a system like Mycelium's sees the network receive the first transaction and believes with growing confidence knows that a double spend won't be propagated.
I think in all this, Peter Todd had an experiment using Eligius which won't mine Satoshi Dice (SD for short) "spam" transactions and SD, together. He could buy things, submit that transaction to Eligius directly - and - make a second transaction with SD where he stood a chance to win some bitcoin. If a merchant lets you buy things irreversibly with a 0-conf transaction - they get screwed if they give you the item based on the transaction they saw propagated by Eligius (which they will mine if they can), but if a totally different miner mines the SD transaction instead (where you may or may not win back a fraction or more of your bitcoin).
Weird world.

I don't know the uptake of smartphones to Africa. I think mPesa only requires an older phone that can do SMS. I'm sure I have outdated views and Africa is probably using smartphones all over the place. I'm sure Nairobi is loaded with people with plenty of money to have a smartphone. 
But mPesa seems to be pretty innovative and bitcoin will probably have a hard time disloging it. I would expect pretty glacial adoption until or unless it can get to a critical mass of users.
Probably bitcoin would need at some point an mPesa minutes to bitcoin exchange. mPesa I think has a lot of the same register users / KYC as a bank account, so it would probably be tricky and regulated.

I think you could make a good case that the off-market groups are trying their hardest to NOT raise bitcoin's price right now.
They have no interest in that until the Winklevoss ETF gets off the ground.
So I think it's going to be late in the year before regular Joes can point a fraction of their 401(k)s at a bitcoin ETF and in a massive self-fulfilling prophecy start the next big boom in bitcoin prices.
Just a guess tho. And if it's late to arrive, it's because some part of Wall Street wants more time to buy before the little guy can.
I think SecondMarket might be getting antsy, which is why I think they're willing to make a new fund that will let unaccredited investors buy in.

Yes I think the current thinking is that elements up to the atomic weight of iron are made in stars, but supernovas can create heavier elements in limited quantities.
And that the solar system was made of dust that had been through supernova explosions ... and that the amount of gold available was essentially set then.
But gold could be on asteroids. Some materials, I think it was gold, could be out there. I have a hope that the 'gold' in an asteroid is the least valuable thing about them. That instead the real value is in actually capturing a chunk of rock that has been in outer space for so long that it holds solar system history in it and helps us understand the Universe.... (and that melting an asteroid down for gold would be ... kind of a waste of its value)

Hmm you'd probably want to grab some time with a lawyer who knows finance...
Georgia: 
Looks like fingerprinting in a system called GAPS, a surety bond (not sure how much but probably north of $100k), have to develop policies for prevent money laundering, 
You could do like a lot of cash ATM machines and have something like a $300 dollar daily limit per user for the machine.
See if you can set this up so that you're the owner, a lawyer is your compliance officer with the duty to report to FinCEN, and another person is the operator/business person that turns in cash, refills with bitcoin, etc.
Keeping these walls up in places so that: YOU can't and won't stop FinCEN reports - you encourage everyone to follow the law, your lawyer can't loot the machine just files reports as they see their duty and helps write things up, you have an operator that maybe fixes the machine (you could give oversight here) and reloads it or whatever or picks up dollars and refills with bitcoins, and you just own and oversee the whole system and problem solve and earn profits.

Well probably with bitcoin it's the usual greed etc, he might be trying to liquidate a large position and once he'd transferred bitcoin and taken dollars and they start saying where the money came from \(after you give them bitcoin\) now you're screwed because you can't get the bitcoin back, and probably the Feds would expect you to give them the dirty money like it's the proceeds of crime and therefore not yours to keep \(makes sense in the abstract, but in bitcoin land there's no take\-backs so you're out the bitcoin\).
So probably what Ong should have done is \- IF \- he sold them bitcoin, they received bitcoin, he got cash, then they said 'hurr durr it was from drugs' \- THEN he should have backed off, \- sounds like he's Canadian \- so then he should have thoroughly snarled shit up for the cops on the USA side by contacting the RCMP and maybe the DEA and maybe Vancouver WA police and maybe anyone that would let him wear a wire and/or totally get all up in it. Like invite people to come to CANADA to buy, and then have RCMP arrest the USA Feds, and cause a total clusterfuck. That'd be smarter.

That seems strange.
The volatility of bitcoin is relative to dollars
 (where dollars are used as the unit of account, naturally, because there is more value stored in dollars and counted that way - and mentally thought of that way by its users)
You'd have to have a coin which pretty much adjusted based on some supply amount, which would be odd. And then people wouldn't speculate on it's value, which would actually be bad for it's adoption I would bet.

Paper wallets are good for offline key storage...
But to sign transactions, you'll have to eventually come up with a signed transaction and then play that into the bitcoin network. You could use an offline computer to sign transactions and then hand-copy across the airgap to a less trustworthy online computer the transaction...  Or maybe import the contents of a paper wallet to wallet software.
Anyway, paper wallets are great for what they are.

Example, say the prison "store" has a bottle of shampoo for 5 dollars. But the payment system takes half your money. So then effectively, the shampoo is 10 dollars.
But if you're just moving value around, and buying things outside of the prison system, then you could buy with bitcoin (not sure if they let you have access to phones and computers, it's probably very limited).

Don't increase your risks so much...
It's true that once you have bitcoin as you do, they are either going to be used in a transaction, or kept as dead stock (or maybe you plan on doing an experiment with the protocol, you could have other reasons for having some).
Assuming you want more wealth, maybe denominated in bitcoin. I would relax and not pursue that. There are so many scams where even if people think the best thing ever is going to happen and be funded by bitcoin investors, why would they tell you? 
Some things I could imagine take a lot of small investors to get going but - like the sale the other day of a gold mine for 3000 bitcoins, getting 1000 people to each chip in 3 bitcoins - that'd be a scam,  because who's going to run the gold mine? What are the expenses? Who's got the time and expertise?
In the end, maybe work on a web site or services yourself that can take bitcoin and see how that can do.

Sure, but having your own blockchain and miners means that you would be attacked by people with mining power that they could bring to bear on your altcoin.
Easier to use Colored Coins for this purpose and get the security of bitcoin underneath it.
And then you can have exactly what you're looking for, little quantities of coin which have a note like 'I am a certificate of Tesla stock' on them and it would be pretty secure, you would just have to use a wallet that handled them properly.

But they played that card for Terrorism. I think .... that if you're an American overseas and you have a hotel room with your luggage and laptop in it ... say you went to Rejkavik? ...That the FBI would still need to get a warrant to search. Wouldn't they? Just because you're overseas and maybe doing something against "terms of service" I'm not 100% sure that exempts them from a warrant....
Except per 9th Circuit court because of Terrorism.
 
Now they have some twists in this case, like that Silk Road was doing something illegal, and doing it in an Icelandic data center - violating their terms of service of the datacenter (a contract between them, not involving the Feds - does breach of contract now result in a Federal raid?), but probably the laws of Iceland.

It has a poor title, but you could call it 'holder subsidy per transaction' (bitcoins mined * USD value of a bitcoin / # of transactions in the block) -- that's weird though. Some of the transactions are dust. If we start sending to 10 addresses each are you going to say transactions went down in cost? No, obviously.
Holders already know they're 'paying' it. They hold (for a lot of reasons) but either because there's a float time, or they are speculating on a future increase in value (but could be for other reasons)

Do companies that do this also have to set things up so that customer funds, like bitcoins signed by m-of-n wallets, are treated like the property held in rental storage units in the physical world?
Like if my local U-Store storage center went out of business and they had loads of debt and back taxes, I presume that the contents of the lockers are the customer's and not the companies? So it's not like the customer's antiques get sold off to pay the company debts?
So in the same way, if a company racked up bit dollar liabilities to creditors or service providers, and then went under, that these bitcoins are not their assets to settle debts with creditors?

The latest rally is party ignoring China and partly fueled by China. The part that is ignoring China is that easy direct deposit is essentially forbidden by PBOC. This means that China's impact should be small, so the West has discounted the idea that Chinese exchanges could be hurt and take bitcoin's price lower. But Chinese exchanges are still finding workarounds to get currency in and out, so there is some risk of bad China news to come. The part that is China-led is that the 4000 CNY number was a psychological barrier to their traders, now that we're past that, they are joining the rally in a big way. I think that anyone still on a Chinese exchange and trading is a big risk-taker, probably any weak hands there have been shaken out, and I'm not sure what percent of the traders there are bag holders waiting to break even on their money and get out.

Probably would be able to access your old coins from prefork days (down each chain). They would essentially be splitting the value and then adding to it from then on.
Like if you had one fork that was normal old slow bitcoin, and another fork that was a new fast GHOST-based bitcoin with ~1 block per second, which is a change in how much work is calculated (it uses a tree instead of a chain), then your old coins which are values at old addresses, would probably still be valid.
Are your *new* addresses valid? In the example above, hilariously, your bitcoin-side movements might actually be totally valid on the GHOST-side, but GHOST-side movements might not be seen at all on the bitcoin-side. But you might not care, because GHOST-bitcoin would have scaled to surpass VISA transactions and the bitcoin-side would be stuffed with weird old super-high-fee movements or something strange.

Oh I'm assuming these are payout spams from the gambling sites - that they have a common wallet that they pay from.

280 is probably kind of borderline for their time. 
1000+ bitcoin is probably a phone call. 
If you go with a broker, then what you get, probably, for 280 bitcoin is them silently filling out a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) because the amount is &gt; $10k. It's nothing personal. 
You can keep this transaction private, but the government will know, and if it's owed taxes, will want their cut.
But you can get a good price probably, check out Coinbase or Second Market's Barry Silbert, or some of the others like Pantera might be interested.

But you may have noticed overall that the prices of some goods like toasters has gone way way down. The prices of other things like state college education has gone up.
Tracking that mix of goods and services is how inflation numbers are figured out.
The Consumer Price Index, CPI, gets tied to benefit calculations, like how much Social Security pays out. Because of that, rising inflation would just result in bigger payouts to Social Security. I read, probably at Shadowstats, that Newt Gingrinch was amenable to letting CPI drive Social Security increases, as long as the CPI was editted to make it look like inflation was lower. And this horrible situation has basically continued, depending on what you believe.
My personal feeling is that real inflation is around 5%. It's higher for things I care about, like owning a home, and it's down for things I don't care about - like anything I can buy at Target.
My income has doubled in 10 years, but it feels like my purchasing power is about the same. Slightly lower even, when I visit Canada. So despite earning more, I make about the same. My stock portfolio is up a LOT, but that's all just inflated trash dollars.

You don't have to feel like you're missing out by being a good guy.
Good guy miners put in the transactions, even 0 fee ones. Well other good guys leave out the 0 fee ones because they are spam transactions (Depending on point of view)
Rational miner says - how big can I make this block and gain the transaction fees inside - and not lose the 25 bitcoins I get from finding a block - because other miners are going to send smaller blocks that could go right over the top of mine and beat me during propagation.
Some miners may want this SO MUCH that they might start to build such a protocol behind the scenes amongst themselves -- a group of miners could 'collude' -- not to mine, but to share information about what they've found in a super high speed way so that the group doesn't get beaten by a block that arrived faster and gets built on faster, so that their 'better' block which just happened to be bigger arrives slower and is accidentally not chosen as the basis for judging which tree shows the most Proof of Work. 
I think.

I think your .torrent example is really good.
The hashing and maybe distribution is not the problem - it would be the poisoned content that's problematic.
I wonder if in the Internet of Things, I wonder how they are going to decide something practical like "This new firmware is good firmware" - maybe they have a decentralized blockchain based idea similar to how Namecoin escapes centralized DNS a little bit and maybe helps people escape centralized SSL, or could.
Do you think it's possible that billions and billions of ordinary toasters and doorknobs would have more compute power to hash and keep a secure blockchain of transaction updates (ie messages) and be able to know and trust a firmware update etc because of that? I think that's an interesting question.

I know transactions have to start somewhere, and it can be impossible given the current design to tell where, but I wish that private submissions weren't okay.
And I don't really mind the idea of a fee being even symbolically small, like a satoshi, if it can give people an idea of priority of transaction.
It seems like you pay about fifty cents to have a transaction in an hour, and five cents to get it overnight, and paying nothing can take longer (would it ever be delivered?)  Do unconfirmed transactions ever "time out"?
Seems like in the current world, miners can do what they want. They can accept these patches or not, process the transactions they want to, or not. This seems okay to me.

Market psychology does get bruised by sudden out of nowhere slams.
You'd have to change the market psychology by having more nets of liquidity slung out to catch the very very cheap bitcoins at the bottom of that curve, the $1, $10, $15 dollar bitcoins and so on. 
But yes, that would hurt the notional paper wealth that people think they have in bitcoin if it's constantly slamming down to the ground in trading value. 
Now, actually what it trades for is of no concern to a customer that gets in and out of fiat-&gt;bitcoin -&gt; bitcoin transfer -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; fiat. Because they're just using it as a medium of exchange. But for holders it would be nerve-wracking.
Ideally a big group could slam bitcoin down every time bulls ready up to go long and if you do it long enough, over and over, the few bears in the group start to get paid off... and grow and grow and grow until they are all standing around waiting to get paid by the these sudden out of nowhere selloffs.
Eventually they get enriched by the selloffs and the tactic would stop working. Once you've spent your coins slamming the market around, it gets harder and harder to get more ammo.
There are still some HUGE holders that you could go to in schemes to set up and slam bitcoin around, one guy (was he with Twitter? I forget) has 100,000 coins. So if he's ever selling, and he probably is sometime, you could return to that well again and again. It's not in his best interest to let people do that to his wealth, but anything is possible with a little deception (we need bitcoin for VC funding!)

Not sure -- probably is the best answer.
There might be a way to hash the header and an ordered list of transactions. 
Then the other nodes could look at the transactions they were working with, and start subtracting some out until they have a header and list of blocks that matches the hash they just heard about (and then go 'ah-hah! winner!') and then they could start mining the next block.
Now technically, you could have a small group of miners, like the biggest 5 or whatever, talking in this faster way - on their own side-protocol - and their big slow block could then propagate out
But maybe a hard fork for the mining is for the best.
I wonder if there's a denial-of-service attack on this though. Maybe it should have some extra hashes - to show SOME proof of work against DDos. A hash of the header and a hash of the transactions, and then both. And all three have to win, but that's probably too radical for anything but a hard fork.

I might have things backwards.
Did they find and work backwards from the servers in Iceland back to wherever in San Francisco (can't remember the town) where they found DPR in a (library? coffee shop?) and distracted and tackled him so they could access the laptop that he used to admin Silk Road?
So the probable cause of a search starts with the back end web servers somewhere?
Why would they go that way instead of starting with fake drug sells that needed more handling, which flipped an insider, who was connected one hop away from DPR, that led to DPR?
I wonder why they are going so backwards with this .... the straightforward story seems so much easier. Well I guess they started it - with this Captcha story. So that has to play out first....

There are some benefits to mining empty blocks, like faster propagation. 
There is a big downside to mining empty blocks, which is what is the point? A bitcoin network that doesn't mine transactions is no good for anybody.
But before worrying when you see empty blocks, sometimes miners don't see any transactions they want to handle for short periods of time, like right after another block full of transactions comes out, and rather than be idle, they go to work on empty blocks while some controlling unit decides what transactions to include and then passes that to their mining units. So you can get an empty block in that 'waiting' time.
Some people also might have found some odd mathematical optimizations on mining certain numbers of transactions or certain transactions, serendipitously.


You have to take the hash of previous blocks into account, so you can't mine into the future ("block chain" - one block following another, connected).

wikipedia - Georgism
"Georgists argue that a tax on land value is efficient, fair, and equitable; and that it can generate sufficient revenue so that other taxes (e.g. taxes on profits, sales or income), which are less fair and efficient, can be reduced or eliminated. Economists since Adam Smith have known that – unlike other taxes – a land value tax would not cause economic inefficiency.[5] A land value tax would also be a progressive tax, since it would be paid primarily by the wealthy, and would reduce economic inequality.[6][7]"
I think that we should not have an income tax at all, only real estate taxes.

Well the network effect is that there are zillions of other programmers, coders, and the like out there. 
Right now if they want to integrate with the 'Stellar' system, they have to go learn about it, possibly get permission to participate, etc. All that is unclear. I guess they can go get Stellar tokens by buying Sprite or something.
If you want to get involved with bitcoin, doge, litecoin, whatever, you don't have to work with anyone else or fit into their plans for world domination or whatever, you just jump in and start coding.
The network effect of bitcoin is that, also, regardless of it's technical merits or whatever, most sites that accept a cryptocurrency will take bitcoin. Unless they're really into their own currency and pumping it hard (eg dogecoin - great people). But a lot of sites are more agnostic. Heck most sites right now take 0 cryptocurrencies.
But if you took one currency, odds are you'd take bitcoin. 
In the small percentage of cases where someone was willing to accept 2 currencies, you could take bitcoin+litecoin, bitcoin+dogecoin, or other bitcoin+favorite alt. 
After that, it does get easier to take more and more coins, 3, 4, 5, 100, ... but some of the smaller alts have liquidity issues and you'd have to price things higher in them for higher-value items.
Or get a processor like BitPay or Coinbase to take those alts. But what's their incentive on a zillion alts? They *could* accept alts but it's so important that their business get the value of bitcoins secured in the system that it's distracting to process too many alts. Some of the alts aren't worth the cost in terms of lack of attention to fundamentals. If they go too far off the rails their main business dies.
Back to network effect - so if you're a programmer, and you have this whole field of cryptocurrencies out there, and you're working with snippets of code, wallet programs, and you're totally agnostic, you can pick any currency to play with, which ones do you try?  
I think it seems like you either go bitcoin because it's so big and serious and has major money behind it, and lots of source code, wallets, software everywhere, or you go doge because it seems like a nice community (but the coin is inflationary and has the same future as Freicoin etc).
I would have advised Square to not drink the snake oil and to not get involved with anything like Stellar. Ignore Ripple/Stellar, take bitcoins, make money. They are over-thinking it.
The only reason I can think of to make your own corporate token-coin like Stellar is for some convoluted and contrived legal reason. Making it effectively something like a 'game token'. That's it though. Still I wouldn't think it's worth it. Better to just dive in and take the risk and use bitcoin directly.

Transcribing it ...
Vanessa Colette: "Well let's talk about bitcoin a little bit. It's continued to gain in traction as a currency. How do you evaluate bitcoin as a store of wealth?"
Mike Maloney: "So far I don't evaluate bitcoin as a store of wealth but I love the fact that the free markets are trying alternatives to government mandated and manipulated currency systems. This is a wonderful thing. The world would be a far more prosperous place, a far more stable place, a place where you could predict what was going happen in the future and have a great chance - probabability of being right if we had free market money. Bitcoin is an attempt at that and I fully support any attempt at getting away from a small group of people trying to decide what the world economy is going to be because the free market has all of the information - it's got the information of every transaction in society. When a small group of people like the FOMC Committee at the Federal Reserve think that they've got, that they know better than the free market and they can decide where we're going to go and set interest rates, it works and distorts the economy and there's a price to be paid for that. They have now trained an entire generation not to save. They have tried to goose the economy by keeping interest rates low but that means that you can't buy a Treasury bond and make gains ahead of inflation. You're actually losing purchasing power by owning a Treasury bond. So therefore, they're punishing savers and training them to be either dangerous speculators where a lot of their wealth can be lost very quickly or to be borrowers and spenders. And so we're going to have an entire generation trying to retire on nothing, expecting the government to take care of them. And the problem is they're the majority, so they're going to vote for the government to take more and more from the producers and give to the consumers. We are rewarding - I'm sorry we are punishing - production and prosperity and rewarding consumption and being freeloaders basically.

For -- why do bitcoins have value? 
I would go to another page ...
Even if _you_ think bitcoins have no value - you can't counterfeit them, and there's a whole market trading currencies (dollars, euros, rubles, yen) for bitcoins.
You can make an alternate currency, like a copy of bitcoin, and run that - called an altcoin. But no one will use it unless you start out with an enormous user base. You could pick a meme, like dogecoin did, and hope to jump start a huge user base, but you may find that a lot of people are only speculatively participating to get rich and will sell your altcoin for bitcoins. If you fumble this, your altcoin dies. A lot of altcoins exist and are trying...
Even if _you_ think the bitcoin ecosystem will crash - when? If you knew, why not short bitcoin and get rich? Would you dare? The growth in value has been astounding, and it has further to go before it succeeds or fails.
And because it's an economics class: 
Obviously if we all went back to a gold standard, our economy would become an unworkable flop - like Krugman's babysitter club example - where hoarding wins and economic activity stops. Where holding deflationary money is a superior 'investment' strategy versus investing it in startup companies like Instagram and SnapChat. Why would we want to deny ourselves the economic growth that innovative multi-billion dollar ideas like tinting digital photos and a centralized corruptible time-delete photo sharing system? It's absurd to think that wealthy techno-visionaries that adopt bitcoin are going to do anything with it, like fund a space mission or come up with a cool company that 3d prints food, or cure Ebola - all of those things take investment, and besides making money, there is absolutely no other reason why humans do anything.
Where are bitcoins used?
Literally anywhere that wants to post a bitcoin address...
"Directly" - Overstock, NewEgg, etc
Indirectly - anywhere that takes Gyft cards.

How do other wallet user interfaces that use QR codes show the 'send to me' (receive?) versus 'send to someone else' (send?)
Maybe it should only show the QR code on 'send to me' (receive?) - with a note like - "show this to the person sending you bitcoins"
and not show a QR code on 'send to someone else' ? (or a have a button that says: click to enable web camera -- and if you click it you see a live webcam, and then .... duh, it wants you to put a QR code up in front of the camera? like a paper wallet with a QR code?)

Countries gain a lot by being able to print their own money. 
Politically, it lets them shield voter/workers from the shocks of an economy which in reality is more geared to boom/bust: people buying, factories producing, employment going up and up (politicians cheered, lions of industry exalted), virtuous circle - then no one buying, factories closing, workers out of a job (politicians booted out of office, capitalists hated), vicious circle. 
Militarily, countries gain the ability to finance their wars because war is not very profitable except for a few well-connected groups. And war's a mess and it kills people and destroys things. And besides wars of survival and necessity, there's all these expeditionary wars of choice that a lot of people are opposed to and would love to see the funding of cut off dramatically.
So with fiat, they can rob the workers/taxed middle class/voters by stealth - print money, enrich cronies, but smooth life out for voters, employment going up and down in more gentle waves, but hey it's kind of nice having a welfare state and unemployment and healthcare benefits. Who pays for that? The voters themselves, collectively, effectively. Fine (it's not a good situation, but voters don't like boom/bust cycles, or would prefer an endless boom - wouldn't we all)
But some countries are epic at misrule. They really go far overboard and hyperinflate their way out of problems and debts, wipe out savers, enrich their friends. In those situations people start to buy things immediately instead of holding currency that will be worth substantially less in the near future. 
So in Venezuela they buy cars to hold value, or in Argentina exchange their currency for the more stable USD. 
Bitcoin comes on the scene as another way to get monie's value in and out through your country and bypass banks and financial controls. So when a country is struggling but well-connected to the Internet, it can make sense to put some funds into bitcoin. Maybe it'll go down 50% or up 100% but the volatility isn't an issue, because maybe your other wealth would just be confiscated.
In more stable Western countries, bitcoin is more of an interesting curiousity and more of a niche. It's a fun niche though. Less likely to ever "take over" in a country with better run banks. But more likely to survive in places where it's clearly not a threat (Switzerland, Canada).
At the individual level, people just start to use these alternate currencies (mostly the USD) as other ways to buy things. Some places are out there where people will be able to possibly use bitcoin more easily than the USD.
Speaking of misrule, in the United States, what seems to be happening over the past 20 years+ with the Fed is that they fund bubble after bubble. But it affects people's lives very unevenly. Hot money chases these bubbles around and gets lucky or unlucky. Some people have gotten magically very wealthy by spotting each bubble, getting in early, getting out near the top, wash rinse repeat. Others get wiped out after a couple of bubbles and hodling when they should have sold. But despite the fortunes of individuals getting rich (often by having made just a handful really excellently timed buy/sell choices in major assets: tech stocks, biotech stocks, real estate, bonds) they are doing great. Others got wiped out and no one noticed their pain and it's sad.

You can make up bitcoin addresses (public/private pairs) to your hearts content. They're just numbers which exist in a massive range of values.
Once you've settled on one to use, you (or someone else) can send bitcoins to the public address. That's how come bitcoin addresses can be 'offline'. The addresses can exist (math) but if you want to send it some value in bitcoins, you have to send it to the public address. Then, on the blockchain, it's involved in a transaction. The numbers always 'existed' (as much as any number *can* exist anyway ... )
The thing is, the range of possible private addresses is COLOSSAL. The public address is a set of hashes which obfuscate the private address, but you can always regenerate the public address from a private address.
So with a paper wallet, like bitaddress.org, when you make a public private keypair - the public side will have a "1" on the address, the private side a "5" - you can make private keys from now til whenever you feel like stopping.
You can send an address that you made up, offline, you can send that bitcoin from somewhere that has it already (or technically, mine it, but skip that).  They can send from where they have it now, to your public address.
You can store it there safely, and when you're ready to move it on to somewhere else (like to a wallet, or to pay for stuff), your private key unlocks that and makes it work.
There are many cool ways to make paper wallets, use a computer you trust (ideally, it's offline, only used for this purpose, but that's ideal - and it depends on how much value in bitcoin we're talking about. For play amounts, it doesn't have to be perfect). 
And then use somewhere like bitcoinpaperwallet.com or bitaddress.org to make the wallets
Nice guides at:
* 
* 
* 
Last - a word of warning about paper wallets. Do not get clever with them. When it's time to spend them, IMPORT THE WHOLE VALUE STORED. (Otherwise, change addresses and lost bitcoin to mining fees.)
Some people get really into cold storage and use stainless steel cards with the addresses written on them in a special way, or get a punch set and some steel and punch their own numbers in. Or you can use a laser printer and some waterproof paper - that's a step better than an ink jet and regular paper. I'm looking forward to the Entropy USB paper generator device that's coming out. There are so many cool and clever ways to do cold storage -ways to split and print out pieces of a secret so that you need 2 of the 3 pieces or 3 of the 5 pieces, or whatever m of n you want - so you can scatter the pieces around in case you lose some. It goes on and on.

Yeah bitcoin is less efficient than a centralized service. But because it's p2p, it's harder to block transactions.
Reversing transactions in the centralized system is easier, but in bitcoin you can do that with escrow systems and insurance.
In the physical world, if I give someone gold, they can run off and hide it and I can't "reverse" that transaction. Bitcoin is like that, it's more a low-level thing. Not physical like gold, but digital. But similar in concept.
Bitcoin will be the go-to currency for international transfers of value because there's less to work out and less middlemen in the way. Everyone is free to engage and innovate and for the most part we don't have to ask lots of permission.
So I think it will succeed because it's another clever evolution of money.

The loophole is that Apple lets businesses and cooperatives install any kind of software they want. Idea being a corporation can install software for their employees, or a credit union their members.
So COG must be a coop, like a business and the members get to install whatever software the business has approved ... 
So this gets around the walled garden in a way.

The key to getting wealthy in bitcoin would be to exactly what they're doing - making a business that gets income, rather than sitting on 'dead stock'.
I would much much much rather own shares of Coinbase or BitPay or Blockchain than have the equivalent value in bitcoins. 
With the companies, you could eventually earn enough to buy the bitcoin you want.
It's similar to this question - which would you rather have: gold or arable land? In the long run what you want is the arable land, because with it, you could farm and earn the gold back. If you start with gold, all you can do is hold or spend.
Right now, feeling stuck, because I think bitcoin is great, but I wish I could invest in companies that used it to make earnings, reduce friction in their businesses, things like that.

Yeah -- I think Gyft bulk-purchases gift cards from major companies with the understanding that they will resell and do whatever AML/KYC is needed, but .... that's just me assuming.
So strange that Europe is closed up in this way, I guess I am surprised that American brands play so nicely with each other. They quite openly sell gift cards everywhere here for all kinds of things.
I never thought of it before but besides renting an apartment, paying utilities, car and car repairs, a lot of everyday items like food, cell phones, gas, clothes and more could all be bought by bitcoin with gift cards.
(Just checked - nope, you can also do lots of car related things with gift cards. Maybe not *buy* a car, but a lot of other things, like change the oil, buy parts, rent a car, etc)

European banking sounds a lot more efficient than US banking.
Here it would be rather harder to send money even to yourself between two different banks. You an send to another person at the same bank but it helps if you're in the same branch, same state, etc. 
It's quite a mess and I would just say that there is plenty of room for improvement...
Most people are with their current bank because it is good enough and has some feature or part of it's operations that works well enough for what they need.
But overall, the system here is very slow and creaky.
There seem to be bright spots, like Internet banks, credit unions, and so on, but there are advantages and disadvantages to each. Credit unions are good for auto loans, major nationwide banks are good at mortgages, etc.
If I had to send money to my brother though, bitcoin is the fast way. We both have bitcoin wallets and bitcoins.

But an honest merchant can pay 1% from each transaction over time, and across thousands of transactions have a pile of burned bitcoin. If they've burned 100s of bitcoin, why would they rip you off for 4 bitcoin? Doesn't make sense, not profitable.
Why burn it instead of donate it? Well the argument goes that some charity could benefit and you make an back channel incentive for those two, the scammer and the charity, to cut a private deal and scam the users.
People could just use an escrow service, but proof of burn doesn't need an escrow service just something like an eater address.
That was my understanding of it, maybe someone can explain it better.

I'm not sure value is created as currency changes hands, necessarily.
If we tax people for shovel-ready projects like hole digging and filling, is the country that does that at 10x the rate of another country, truly better off?
Or is it just mal-investment and misappropriated resources?
The Fed needs to stop pumping the economy and let it settle. They should stop trying to control the business cycle and find a new way for the labor market to wind up and wind down. Like .... job-sharing .... or something else anyway other than pushing on a string with this QE stuff.
The main issue is that everyday people have a lot of debt and it just doesn't matter how low you can make those rates go. Prices for things they care about, like homes and education, are going up. It's driven by the lending and low rates. It's not like these homes are that much better. (They are in some ways, sure.)
This is such a mess. The Fed should just stop.

I would love to be able to stop double spends by nearly casing in stone the idea that the first transaction that arrives is THE ONE. And a second transaction coming later trying to spend the same inputs is SOL.
Can we also make it an ordering rule that in the case of a hash collision - the first transaction to arrive takes special priority - beyond priority, fees, or anything else? 
Then if enough miners mine this way we could defeat miners trying to doublespend?
Maybe I need to look elsewhere for this... 
Is it good or bad to somewhat lock miners into processing the first transaction they see? Would a doublespender inject to one miner, then delay, then send to the rest of the network somehow (is that how they would plan to abuse it?)
@_date: 2014-10-15 02:22:52


I think that exists. I think they call it 'demurrage' where it loses value over time if you don't spend it. Peercoin has done that. You can buy some Peercoins if you like?

I think bitundo transactions can be done secretly or openly.
The secret ones are mined only by the bitundo pool and surprise broadcast if they succeed. Those might not be seen by Mycelium until it's too late.
The openly transmitted double spends could be picked up and mined by patched miners who participate but aren't part of the bitundo pool...
Maybe the *real* patch should be something that doesn't let unpropagated transactions get mined. (Hmm no...)

Uh.... I'll trade you inflating poorly-secured sidechain coin for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:02:34
Sure. Here's a simple way. Use colored coins. ChromaWallet.
But the low-tech way:
Pick an address filled with bitcoin as your company's start address for the software. All the outputs will be something like 0.0001 or a satoshi 0.00000001.
When someone buys a copy of your game, ask them for a bitcoin address they can send this to that they won't mingle and accidentally spend. Something like a paper wallet so they don't make the mistake of mixing it up. Or like a blockchain.info wallet, since it has a handy "Sign a Message" feature that will show up on the blockchain.
Once they have the address, "activate" the software by having them sign a message you make up, back at that destination address.
Or rather, the software asks: what destination did you put it at? (And the software checks that that output has your company's starting bitcoin address as it's parent). And then says: okay, go ahead and sign a message there then... and sees the message it just made it. So then it knows you must control the destination address.
You could make it something like that.

If you had a public IP address for a web front end, you could use ARIN.net and put in the IP and find out which data center or hosting it's coming from.
Then ... you could see that it's hosted in Iceland, fill out a warrant, contact the State Department, contact the government of Iceland, contact the police, surreptitiously monitor the server, collect loads of evidence ... etc. Lots of work - but to me, it sounds like they did not make this an airtight case.

Ouch ... (from the paper):
* Many Visa credit cards will approve unlimited value transactions in a foreign currency; this allows the attack to maximise the money extracted from each credit / debit card.
* The contactless interface allows transactions to be extracted whilst the card is still in the cardholder’s wallet.
* The cardholder’s PIN is not required for contactless transactions; this allows the fraudulent transaction to be extracted from the card without any further interaction from the cardholder.
* Visa contactless cards will approve transactions in offline mode; this allows the attack to be performed without connecting to the card payment system, thereby avoiding any additional security checks by the bank.
* The merchant details are not included in the data cryptographically protected by the card; this allows the merchant details to be added later, making the attack more
flexible and scalable.
* While the EMV protocol requires payment cards to authenticate themselves to the Point of Sale (POS) terminals, currently there is no requirement for POS terminals to authenticate themselves

The altcoins do water down the bitcoin brand a little, but on the other hand I think a lot of people are on the sidelines because either they think 'hey I could just make an altcoin and get rich' and if they're the creator and can get a community going, that lasts until the middlecoin pool shows up and mines them to a higher difficulty and smashes their price. Early adopters would still be winners in a pre-mined altcoin, but the rest, they would have been better off with bitcoin.
I think it chaps people's caboose that early bitcoin adopters have thousands of BTC and they don't. But I think they don't realize that wealth is everywhere and for a good idea, you can be wealthy too - in anything!

Taking me a second to parse what you're saying -- "better plays here than buying Bitcoin if you're betting against Dollar collapse" (meaning: better plays here than buying Bitcoin if you're betting the Dollar will not collapse)... yes, like stocks, real estate (ideally things that rise in value as the dollar inflates over time, probably things that earn income, so that unlike savings, you don't get wiped out.)
Yeah I don't really see dollar collapse as being super likely (hyperbitcoinization would be the funny term for that). But yeah, for me bitcoin is just for fun. I think bitcoin is that 1% or tenth of a percent % of a portfolio for hot money / speculation on price increase of bitcoin / black swan kind of stuff.
I think it's good advice to check out and maybe watch out for a kind of gambler's addiction to bitcoin. (Like, staking all your hopes and money on it.)

The wall of text is really long, but I think you were trying to say to withdraw bitcoin from the site, they need you to click a link in an email confirmation.
You can change the email in your account, or ask support to help you ... and they'll change your email to confirm withdrawls if you ask?
So if I know a login/password to btc-e.com, I could ask that they set the email to something else, and they would? And then I can confirm a withdrawl to a new place? Ugh. So then having fancy two-factor email etc wouldn't protect me?
Does btc-e.com itself allow the use of 2FA to log into them?

Even if it was as big as gold, that's not that big. Gold's value is a teensy tiny sliver of all the world's wealth.
There is so much lopsided wealth already in the world, bitcoin going to the moon isn't going to move the needle on the Gini coefficient in any country worth noting.

If your business is in the business of shipping things after a short delay, you're a good candidate to accept bitcoin as a business. You can use BitPay or Coinbase and when people send you bitcoins, you have dollars same as now, but with a wider global audience of buyers.
If you need to buy from other suppliers, you can use bitcoin to buy and you don't have to sweat their currency. Say you have business in Japan, and that company is Rakuten Super Logistics -
    well, now you convert dollars to bitcoin and they convert bitcoin to yen. 
Any currency needs two people using it for it to work, else what's the point? So if you have a supplier, and you want to pay them, and they can accept bitcoin, then cool. You have to know if other people in the chain are willing. If not, then it's not there yet. You can signal your own readiness easily by having BitPay or Coinbase arrange so that you can accept payment in bitcoin, and then you instantly have a global market.

Different parts of the bitcoin system aren't fleshed out very well:
More anonymity:
* Something like DarkWallet and some statistics work, or something like Monero to make really seriously anonymous transactions
More decentralized markets:
* Counterparty, is a great idea, but maybe not the right place for a live bitcoin exchange - looks good for buying and selling commodities for bitcoin though, something bigger/slower. 
* OpenBazaar development could be cool - take on EBay, disintegrate SilkRoad silliness and centralization. Let everyone be their own merchant...
* Any way to spread things back out so that centralized mining pools go the way of the dinosaur - something like open chip designs for bitcoin mining SHA-256 at various nanometers so that making a run of chips is no big deal. Ideally, mining rigs become space heaters which give off heat and make money to compensate - free heat in winter? ;) a fantasy dream
* Making the number of transactions scale way up? Clever math and help to Gavin for the IBLT would be neat.
* Looking through the code of bitcoind, pseudocoding it, making it more secure, coding it in different languages in order to figure out the odd cases
Website ideas, like ... coinmap 
* Imagine that you could have something like .... food/clothing/shelter and then more and more essentials of life, like gasoline, cars, car repair, .... food (groceries/fast food/high end food), shelter - to rent, homes to buy, vacation hotels that take bitcoin ... We lack a Coverage Map or some kind of Livability Score - and an easy way to tell what's *Missing*. Like Gyft cards, if you add/subtract them, what's covered or not covered? There are places that take bitcoin directly, and places that take bitcoin indirectly. Right now any given countries' currency works pretty much everywhere in that country. But bitcoin is this odd man out and it only works in some physical places nearby, or on the Internet where it's basically everywhere. It's so hard to get your head around where you can and can't use it and for what.

The proverbial canary in a coal mine will be when spent addresses' balances get drained.

People will demonstrate a quantum computer slowly and uneconomically mining bitcoin long before a full-on effort can be made by anyone to switch over to quantum computing mining for real. People who do science for a living, in my opinion, are mostly not in it for the money as much as for the kudos and the ability to be famous for their achievements. There's a cool factor to using a quantum machine that would draw people. I'd say 80% chance or better that there'll be an academic show off. Or even a situation like 'cold fusion' where people get irreproducible results long before there's a real break.
So the blockchain will show some rising hashrate and I don't expect anything to go wrong. The economics will make the ASIC guys wonder how someone else is mining so hard if electricity is so expensive... and rumors of a quantum crypto break will just make them go buy some of the same hardware. The arms race goes on and on.
But what defenses?
The public key of a bitcoin address is actually not the raw elliptic public key. It's also been hashed twice by SHA-256. But the elliptic keypair gets semi-revealed somehow when you spend from an address. I think because you need the private key to sign the transactions, because they don't have any outbound transactions (yet). 
So most likely if quantum computers get used to steal from addresses, they will not be stealing from cold storage. So for a while, hot wallets would be at risk. During whatever panic sets in, people's work around with hot wallets will be to completely drain the spend address and send change from spends to an all new address. That is, not send change back to the original address where it could be stolen. 
Then bitcoin will fork - will switch algos. Probably with some goofball intermediate like Triple SHA-256 or 30 SHA-256 (who cares?) as people did with Triple DES while waiting for AES. 
The developers, miners, etc will agree on a new algo for blockchains which recognize old and whatever new algos they have for a while, then phase out the old one as hardware gets out of date, over the course of 1-5 years.

Oh it's no big deal. Oh also, regarding leverage. Probably doesn't matter how much leverage there if the liquidity isn't there, arbing opportunities aren't workable, and if these exchanges can pack up fly-by-night and take your investment funds with them... that would keep Wall Street at bay for sure.
There's a possible future where everyone has bitcoin and lending comes to a halt because it's easier to just hoard than it is to invest. Do you see that as a probable outcome? I think that *could* happen, but the future instead of being for investment (streams of income, greater fool etc), big things will happen because it will take breakthrough thinking and breakthrough products that really make a difference. Then spending and investing is easy. Right now with easy money I just see a lot of mal-investment, different topic though.

Can you tell me more about what a sidechain and the relationship to a  "nearby node" is?
I thought a sidechain would be something like an alt coin with a two-way peg to bitcoin and maybe merged mining. Out there on a sidechain, you have a new coin with whatever rules it wants to have - maybe "10 second confirmations" or whatever, or an off-blockchain system with a peg.
What does "nearby" mean, this sounds like an interesting wrinkle.

Crude but maybe someone could draw a QR code out on even the cruddiest EPSON receipt printer ... 
This more modern label from an EPSON in Singapore shows a workable QR code - so get to that model and maybe some things get easier to do -

@_date: 2014-10-27 15:55:46
The miners could give themselves free tokens on the other side and prime the pump with bitcoin on the main chain. Then add cool features and see if the sidechain solves an actual problem (adds value). If it does, bitcoins come flooding in and voila, you as the dev own most of the sidechain coins, so cash out whenever.
Or build a business, support it functionally with a side chain and services for a fee, and get VC money to grow.

For sure they're not allowed to price things in bitcoin. 
But they are probably kowtowing to official government will by just not accepting bitcoins at all. Opinions vary about whether or not the rules were spelled out super clearly, but I think that in China you don't go by what's written down, instead you're supposed to be a mind-reader of government intentions.
This is because bitcoin got caught up in their previous rules against private business money like QQ. And just in general the Chinese government has currency controls.
Bitcoins are still traded there in a big way but it's hard for merchants to take it officially.

I think that donations have to be declared openly.
I would bet ... these rules would apply:

If a committee receives a cash contribution exceeding $100, it must promptly return the excess amount to the contributor. If an anonymous cash contribution over $50 is received, the amount in excess of $50 must be used for some purpose unrelated to federal elections. 11 CFR 110.4(c)."
Right or wrong, probably send bitcoins back to the address it came from if it was not anonymous or just ask if the person wants the remainder back to some particular address? Or cash it and snail mail back cash/check?
11 CFR 110.4(c).:
I think they can keep the money and use it, but not for re-election. The right thing to do would be to donate it to the Red Cross or a Veteran's group or something the politician is passionate about.

@_date: 2014-07-17 03:37:55
ugh I just realized my example is backwards...
If wealthy gold-holders hoard, while normal people keep spending as usual, the price of goods, priced in gold, would go down.
But if prices are down, then businesses have less reason to invest, employ people etc, and I think that's the deflationary spiral central banks think about.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:25:07
I bet 0-confirmation with 0 fees could be a problem.
I think that if you have a normal transaction with a small fee, and then have a second transaction with a Bigger fee, that maybe you could do a double-spend.
Would that second transaction with a bigger fee truly be ignored?
@_date: 2014-08-22 08:05:40
Well traders would prefer volatility because they can make money merely on the motion, the rise and fall, of the price.
Pretend bitcoin dropped in price precipitously, fell to like $100. And then sat there, basically in a sine wave, going up and down from $80 to $120, day after day. Now that's too predictable a pattern, but you could make money selling at $120, and then rebuying at $80, selling at $120, etc. The motion up and down is profits for them.
So all of them get in and start doing that, riding those waves up and down, dampening it out, smoothing it out. 
They are drawn to the volatility itself, and they "take profit" but also participate in bitcoin's value (and the value of other things they could choose to invest in - it's a free country, so they could always rebalance out of bitcoin to other assets, or diversify into bitcoin from other assets).
They probably intend to put value in (buy bitcoins) to get started, then ride the volatility for more profits. They probably like that it feels uncorrelated to the stock market to them. But I think a lot of traders are betting that the other traders are using hot money, which could leave in a flash. 
Will be interesting.

The shifts to and from altcoins and back to bitcoin are going to have to take a fee or a cut of different percentages of the underlying bitcoin.
So bitcoin -&gt; litecoin -&gt; merchant, or bitcoin -&gt; dogecoin -&gt; merchant, or bitcoin -&gt; (your favorite alt here) -&gt; merchant,
Each of those will have a conversion rate that will be dependent on the underlying liquidity of the alt.
Bitcoin has the best liquidity right now, but obscure alts are going to have poor liquidity -- you might not care, because you might be trying to cash out your altcoin or something, but eventually people looking to not risk the highs/lows of altcoin speculation will just avoid altcoins.

Well I can imagine two main ways a 51% attack could occur.. one is a rapid hardware advance by a big miner.
The other is the consolidation of the mining industry accidentally into one too big entity.
The reason it would be an accident is that a miner might want to get very close to 51% - like 45% - but ideally, not go over. They reduce their variance in bitcoin payouts if they are nearly half the network.
If they accidentally go over 51%, they harm bitcoin's value, which is the thing they're mining. So they are playing the economic game called 'Chicken'. 
Next the big hardware advances of CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC are in the past. Now people mine on ASICs and develop more and more specialized chips. But the age where someone could accidentally bring way too much hashing power on board too quickly has probably come and gone. Nowadays it would cost many millions of dollars to add just a few percent. So not as likely to swamp the boat by tech development from nowhere.
Some of the big mining groups now are pools, not individual companies. So individuals in the pools can always leave for another pool if the game of chicken starts to get out of control and hashing approaches 51% with a pool.

From the two-way peg conversation, apparently the sidechainers are taking the risk of having the whole bitcoin value of their side chain looted, so that's something maybe negative. But that seems to come with the territory... that if there's something of value there, then people will attack it, and if you mis-code something, BAM, you lose.
The other side I thought was interesting was someone I forget who suggested that if sidechains get linked in and hold value, then those who mine bitcoin and sidechains both get to use less than 51% hash power to attack bitcoin's value, which I didn't really understand...
And then yeah, I think there's a lot of altcoin writers looking to get (paid) for speculative innovative ideas in their premines which they can dump on Cryptsy etc.
So... overall I like sidechains because it seems to defang the altcoin pumpers. They can then add value and get bitcoin backing. I actually think more sidechains might not be scams compared to altcoins if done right.
@_date: 2014-07-26 07:19:20
Sidechains with pegs to other altcoins so they can be merge mined via bitcoin, get base value pegged to bitcoin, and go off and add off chain altcoin features and value without having to ask permission from bitcpin core devs for changes and permission to innovate :-)

Bitcoin is more divisible than gold. There won't be a liquidity trap the same way because eventually at some price you can (probably) find a buyer for whatever goods and services you have.
Like say we were in a bitcoin world, and front page of has some land in Texas prominently for sale, about 1000 acres for about 32 thousand bitcoin. Well ... okay, there are people out there with 10,000+ bitcoin ... I personally think that they should divide that down into lots that people that have bitcoins could actually buy... like 10 acre plots for 320 bitcoin or so. But the problem is the divisibility of the land for sale, not the divisibility of the bitcoins.

With a blockchain you could say 'this set of addresses is the Treasury of our State'. Every transaction in it would have to be explained - and it's that public explanation that winds up being the same thing to audit as the blockchain. 
I think a blockchain lets people ask low level questions, like where did this 125 BTC go? They could lie about the meaning of the addresses. For example they could label it 'Water Tanks' when actually it's for tanks. Etc.
So some commitment to honesty is essential no matter what they use.

The reason Spain is having these problems is because they look at their woes and do what they're doing instead of thinking to themselves: "What would Switzerland do?"
Tighten up the bolts on your government, Spain. Switch to taxes that can't be evaded, like property taxes. Kick your crony friends out of power, and institute some rigor into your banking laws. Get some transparency and audits in place. But keep secrecy and privacy the watchwords of your banking system. Do not loot people's accounts. Don't even dream of it. Summarily dismiss from government any staffer that suggests it and bar them from future government employment and the finance sectors.
You could fix your problems Spain, but you have to get a grip.

(short answer yes)
Some thoughts on it. If you knew FOR SURE that the investment was rapidly going to go up in value (that's probably not likely right unless you know something) - then the best is to go all in lump sum. -- Most people do this at the wrong time. They go all in exactly when they shouldn't. Also, they may have a gambling problem.
But if you expect in the future a flat or jaggedly curve, potentially U-shaped, with in the long run, a rise out of it, then dollar cost averaging is a good idea.
If you expect that there will be ups and downs and eventually a crash, then you should not invest at all.
Most people would say yes, dollar cost averaging is best during an accumulation phase.
Hope you enjoyed the thoroughness.

No, don't freak out and let fear of missing out (FOMO) grab you. Just enjoy and dollar cost average if you are accumulating. Obviously, if you knew for sure that bitcoin was going to go up, go all in. But no one knows if bitcoin will go up or if it will go down. If we knew, we'd leverage to the hilt, tell no one, do what needed to be done, and come out super rich on the other side. Most likely, like the Sports Illustrated effect, there's been news, you've noticed, and bitcoin like sports superstars will have a reversion to the mean (eg go down like it has the past half year). 
I'd be in just enough to be interested in the price, but not so far in that I freak out about daily price moves. You don't want to be over invested in this thing.

Going back to your NARA real estate coin idea ....
Say we had a mining rig for this thing, and we get one assigned by being an agent..
It makes coins, but can I trade the coins for something? Maybe? I can't I think you were saying something like that. I don't think you said you wanted the coins to be traded outside the system. Otherwise I wind up with a NARAcoin to bitcoin exchange rate probably.
Or that the coins aren't important but something in the NARA network is, some kind of blockchain. Is this where you wanted to store home titles, with these real estate agents being the keeper of the keys which inject the info (like: home / lot property sold on this date /time for this much money, maybe some other transactions like this home / lot split or joined, and maybe some tamperproof notary like system for other details like insurance claims. )
Okay so say you had this blockchain in this side coin? How much is it worth to put in fake records and break it's integrity? A lot? A little? That starts to outline the incentives for breaking it. 
If it's closed-ish - in that you need a mining unit / realestate license / NARA membership in order to play transactions onto the unit and those transactions are worth something, it also sets up a black market for bad actors, either bribed/stolen/cloned/hacked whatever. 
I think the elegance of bitcoin is that bitcoins themselves are worth something to the miners (bitcoins!), transactions have fees for priority, you can put messages into the blockchain (proof of existance of a document for example - the title to a home), and it just seems like all the incentives are in place.
Including of course, if blockchain things become valuable, and bitcoins are needed to move value around, but the big value turns out to be this incredible "tamperproof" record - the blockchain. Then that sets up incentives to steal or rewrite the blockchain - attack it. 
If you hate it as a competitor or as an underminer of authority, then you might find it cost effective to break bitcoin or (since people are what use it now - not distributed autonomous corporations / programs / robots) - you can take measures against the people that use bitcoin etc. But what a side discussion that is.

It has checksum characters and probably about a 1 in 4 billion chance of making a double typo - one in the main address and one in the checksum - that actually works out to be a spendable address.

I agree with you - sidechains aren't going to be able making money/value the usual altcoin pump and dump way where the author clones a coin, tweaks, premines and then pumps and dumps on noobs.
Instead sidechains will be as you say, created to serve a larger business model that a profitable VC will fund. They're not going to pour funds down a speculative bitcoin rathole, except to have bitcoin to help them drive their projects. Eg - Tim Draper's bitcoins - those are there to help get the liquidity in place for overseas bitcoin exchanges, not to just 'hodl'.
So 100% agree with you, I see centralized sidechains in the future, but that's fine they can do whatever.

Oh sure, I could imagine this kind of required service contract and violation could be engineered to happen on Ferrari's and Tesla Model 3. 
I heard horror stories of Ferrari's requiring expensive dealer-only service. But not sure how that works. 
And the Tesla Model 3's I heard were going to be sold to Tesla staff, made to sign NDAs etc, so that the normal engineering bugs of a new product are held over people that have every incentive to drive normal and keep quiet to the public about problems. 
If those kinds of cars took it up a notch, and  .... maybe if we entered contracts.
Another angle: I heard that mobsters used to just use limo services. The cars they were in didn't technically belong to them. So there was nothing to seize. 
Also, that during the drug war, people would shuttle drugs in cars that weren't their own, by towing companies that also aren't theirs. So there is no "driver" in the drug carrying vehicle, the carrier is not at fault either. Whose assets do you seize? (well, the drug lords, but they are nowhere to be found) etc.
Well anyway, all this stuff is outside bitcoin per se, but the usual cat and mouse game of cops and robbers goes on, many times with innocent people caught up in the gears of police, courts, jail and now civil asset forfeiture.

Yeah, holding 'dead stock' of bitcoin was never going to be their plan. The first wave of VCs - that's not their plan either. They want to make money, like Coinbase, whether bitcoin prices go up or down - 1% on the sells plus a spread - and whether bitcoin succeeds or fails. After a few rounds of funding, they can either keep going or sell out to a larger buyer. I thought Coinbase was a brilliant way for the Winklevoss twins to find a way to convert their bitcoin holdings into inventory for a company. Better tax advantages plus it gives that company some bitcoin liquidity. (They probably don't need quite that much)
I can imagine Wall Street arbing the ETF with physical bitcoin, or going across markets and chasing differences between them, but the exchanges are too opaque and getting fiat in and out to balance things can be sketchy.
So we'll see what next year brings.

They'll want to use a 'live' device to do the prices and make the QR codes.

Yeah, if bitcoin buys you mobile minutes (which is what I think m-Pesa is really selling and trading) then you don't need to go to and from Kenyan Shillings and mobile minutes. I think it was Safaricom which is the cell phone provider involved. So if Safaricom takes bitcoin along with KES then gave mobile minutes, they're done. Bitcoin is so easy to accept for digital intangible things like cell phone minutes, that I'm amazed they haven't done it. My suspicion is that the company is already tied up in assloads of red tape and AML/KYC crudola.

What's weird is people will often have cell phone access before they have public sanitation systems.
It's just so much easier to make a technology choice for yourself and not have to wait to have the infrastructure put in. Cell phone towers and fiber optics back to mainline phone systems of course are infrastructure but way easier to deploy than clean water.
Cell phone / SMS is admittedly less than full on Internet access, but 4G or other technologies aren't so far away from consumers if they can afford it. And usually it's not too bad, and once they have mobile minutes they can buy and forward, those systems like m-Pesa just seem to take off.

See if you can get another cool company going. The talent is rare, people that can do it have the world as their oyster. Maidsafe had an interesting IPO, but people I think didn't have enough time to invest, it was over too quickly.
If people could contribute to a super cloud and get paid in bitcoin, or fund and invest with their bitcoin, they will go nuts for this.
In the meantime if you wanted to buy bitcoin, a large amount like that is probably bought off market. I see BitPay mentioned, I bet SecondMarket too could help.

Warren Buffet is not a speculator and not even a venture capitalist.

Why isn't it a basic part of the bitcoin protocol to sign not only the inputs and outputs but the timestamp too? And if you have a later transaction that you can prove is lying because the signed timestamp is so far off base ... 
What are the consequences of mining a junk transaction now? Do the other miners cancel or claw back the entire block mined because of a bad transaction?

It's the ability to spend the same bitcoins to two different addresses..
You just send to two addresses and one of them will win by getting 1 confirmation in the next block (maybe). If someone trading them bitcoins for products is not looking for confirmations, that seller might get scammed.
But ... not sure if you've heard of this problem with other digital things. Like copying mp3's or duping Wow gold or Diablo2 items and things like that. Bitcoin is the first thing I'd ever heard of that didn't let you make copies of something digital (like double your bitcoins) - but was decentralized. You could make an ACID-compliant database or something but usually there's some flaw somewhere that lets someone pull cash out of an ATM machine but still have a balance in a bank account - and there's always the flaw that the person running that central database could just add some numbers to their own accounts and who would know? Bitcoin's cool feature is that it solves that problem ... good starter explanation I saw was the one about the 'digital apple' -- 
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:04:19
I don't know ...
Do you think that you could have side-chains which are pegged to bitcoin,
and then merge-mine those side-chains with the same bitcoin software you have now,
and effectively create a 'tree' of bitcoins? 
I bet you could? You could always have 'old' miners who are mining only the main bitcoin chain,
But you could have new ones which are - without having to add any more CPU - merge-mining 'bitcoin alts' which are side-chained to the main chain - and getting extra transactions' fees -- probably these side chains wouldn't give them a coinbase block reward but ... maybe?
Anyway, I think that there is a glimmer of hope in there somewhere for bitcoin's future and it *might not* require a massive hard fork.
If I had to predict, I think that in bitcoin this will be a really good idea in 2022.

I think it's not as likely that the coins went to addresses where Mt Gox lost the private keys.
Instead, as you suggest, I think that some people were able to create funds inside the system which showed balances in dollars/yen/euros which were fake, used them to buy Mt Gox 'goxcoins' - but critically - were able to get out actual bitcoins (not IOUs) - and maybe Mt Gox's tools got jacked.

I love your example. 
Tell me the same example but with bitcoin if you can? I don't want to waste your time but it went over my head.
In my imagination, the steel mill contracts with you to do the work, but they haven't paid you anything in bitcoin. Every day they're down, they are out $17k usd - their unit of account. But to you say it's around 30 bitcoin loss (pretend you use bitcoin for everything) - a loss in the future though, you haven't been given earnest money or anything to do the work. But say the total contract is about $170k and represents 10 days work (300 bitcoin to you, more or less)
You do the work and as you're doing it, there's this two-day delay. In the contract they stipulate that they get to assess a performance penalty.
You get less bitcoins in the end, something like 240 bitcoin. How is that worse or whatever than getting hypothetically $136k instead of $170k (2 $17k penalities).  I mean it's .... the same isn't it?
Or does dollar cash have some properties that bitcoins don't in this case?
You can still take each other to court for non-performance, regardless of how you're paid. Or if they stiff you and don't pay ...
Okay that's one difference - US Dollars are legal tender and can clear out any obligations.
If the contract was denominated in dollars as unit of account, and you're thinking 30 bitcoins - but say in 10 days the cost of a bitcoin went up 30% - now you're thinking you're going to get 30 bitcoins but they'll be worth a lot more in fiat terms - - well maybe a court would look that over and decide that dollars are legal tender, period. And paying in it is forced on you by the courts - as it's meant "for all debts public and private"

Right and some people think that the private and public keys are directly connected, and your diagram does a good job of showing -- that that's not exactly true (and it enhances the security of bitcoin addresses).
The public key in a bitcoin public/private keypair is also wrapped up in the ripemd and sha256 hash functions. So a bitcoin public key is really a *hash* of the public key. 
If you send bitcoins to a bitcoin address and don't spend from it, you are more secure than if you spend.
If you spend, then the signature of that spend got signed by your private key, which in a theoretical way leaked some information about what the private keys' contents might be.

^ I agree with this guy - you could store anything in the blockchain with enough time and bitcoins.
You could encrypt the file, encode it in an obscure way in the addresses, make it be based on the payout amounts ... it seems like you can have a lot of little payouts and either the size of the payout or the address they go to could be used as keys and data to build back up a picture of whatever it is you're trying to store.
If you make your 'file format' on the blockchain look a lot like a miner's payout from a pool, and the data you pay out is encrypted, and you ran a pool, you really couldn't prove or disprove if they were encrypting anything forbidden. 
Then other people could do the same and even though they're not miners, it still wouldn't be easy or possible to tell.
If a "mixer" service mixed coins and/or hid data on the blockchain, no way you could tell what was going on (was the purpose of this to mix coins? to hide data? both?)

To those suggesting blacklisting VPNs - How could you possibly do that? It's trivial to set up port forwarding - you could bounce off a friend's IP.
Say your friend was on the internet, running Windows firewall, they could run this netsh command and forward you right along...

Or if we use IPv6, routing is built in. And you as a client could change your IP dynamically all the time, user request logs with source IPv6 would be pretty useless.

Mmmmmm .... decentralized systems are inherently less 'efficient' in terms of how many copies of a database are being kept (the blockchain) and how many network messages are passed around in a mesh of connections instead of in a star of centralized databases and remote terminals like VISA.
But bitcoin's inefficiencies come with benefits like being able to pay someone without a third party in the way making up it's own rules about who can send money to whom and who is allowed to receive (blacklisting/whitelisting)
Another benefit is that everyone has their own ledger and they don't have to take a centralized third party at their word.

If you think the downloads don't need to be instant:
As few as 1 to 3 confirms for little items, if you were an exchange maybe as many as 6 confirms.
Would need to see that there's a fee attached.
And after what MtGox went through, maybe try to stick to the standard bitcoind, but ask it questions behind the scenes about the confirms, or make calls out to blockchain.info's API. Something semi-standard like that so that you don't get burned recoding your own interpretation of the blockchain.
Address Lookups
To filter by x number of confirmations include the confirmations parameter
e.g. /q/addressbalance/1EzwoHtiXB4iFwedPr49iywjZn2nnekhoj?confirmations=6
to only include transactions with 6 or more confirmations. This is extremely important if you are processing valuable transactions.
    getreceivedbyaddress/Address - Get the total number of bitcoins received by an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
    Add the parameters start_time and end_time to restrict received by to a specific time period. Provided times should be a unix timestamp in milliseconds. Multiple addresses separated by |
    getsentbyaddress/Address - Get the total number of bitcoins send by an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
    addressbalance/Address - Get the balance of an address (in satoshi). Multiple addresses separated by | Do not use to process payments without the confirmations parameter
    addressfirstseen/Address - Timestamp of the block an address was first confirmed in.

the part where the transactions are ordered -- coinbase reward comes first, then it orders by size (sounded like smallest results first) and sorts again to make sure it's transactions which are not dependent on others which come first.
I'm not even sure if it matters but ...
First thought is that some pools (Eligius?) didn't like SatoshiDice "spam" or anyway, some sites don't like little transactions. Is there some way to sort it so that by fee size or something so that bigger fees are more likely to get through?
Or would every possible transaction in the mempool be included?
Or some consideration for transactions that have been waiting more than 1 confirm and have a fee?
Well keep up the brainstorming! Thanks!

@_date: 2014-08-12 18:05:03
^ This.
The miners already have all the transactions. There's no need to transmit them in a block. The transactions were already relayed to the miners.
They need to know how to order the transactions, and their idea of 'all the transactions' has to be pretty close to what the mined block said was in there, but there is some room for freedom in determining what to mine (but not as much freedom as now)
If you choose NOT to patch as a miner, you are screwed by the way.
This high-speed way of passing hashes around could be done on a parallel bitcoin network amongst say - the top 3 or 4 mining pools - and if they communicate blocks this way, shaving time off, and then through 'gateways' tell the old unpatched network the block contents in full, all the miners that don't patch are going to be constantly having their work orphaned by a good-sized percentage.
It will be as if those other parts of the network are able to both screw them by having faster propagation like empty blocks, along with actually confirming transactions and taking those away too.
The cost is that miners won't be as free to pick and choose transactions to mine, and ideologically that might be bad. Or it might be good.
It's bad if you think miners should have the freedom to mine what they like and not be told by anyone what they can and can't do.
It's good if you think that this makes the system preserve fungibility in a big way - maybe it bakes in the whitelisting of almost all the addresses. 
I don't think it hurts the system, I think it's a big improvement.

Lol, 
Let me know if you find an efficient way to do SHA-256 on paper ;) (and the ECDSA too) - 
I see diagrams like this --  
and kind of wish it was possible to take your 256-coin flips (or dice, whatever) and make a worksheet for people, round after round, but  / SHA-256, 
I guess it has 8 32-bit internal numbers (A through H on the diagram?), maybe write those down in hex so they are 8 hex digits each, and then go down the page doing whatever operation you're supposed to to each set.
Have each round be a page, you have 64 pages for doing one SHA-256 pass, another 64 pages for another SHA-256 pass, and then whatever amount of work the Elliptic Curve crypto is.
UGGGHHHH :) But if you pull it off, it would be funny.

I'm not convinced that inside bitcoin you can fix this.
The 10 minute window for 1 confirmation is a balance between propagation time across the network and the chance of making an alternate chain.
I thought that if you lowered the confirmations down to something like 10 seconds or 1 minute, you'll have rollbacks and new chains coming out all the time.

Looks like some central banks have the ability to borrow dollars without asking, get "market rates", can lend to whoever in their own country they want to, but that foreign bank is on the hook if whatever company or bank that did the borrowing from them defaults. The Fed gets an asset on its books for the loan, gets paid back at the overnight or various lengths of time bond rates, goes through the New York Fed, gets paid back if they pay it all back with interest.
I think they thought it would be temporary but is apparently useful enough to the goals of all concerned that they'd like to make it permanent.
I wonder if this is Central Banks locking arms in order to discourage currency speculators.

Hi I think you might have misunderstood Gavin's system for confirming blocks - it works a lot like the current system, but with a little bit of difference.
Start with a pretend version of today's system - 100 miners, and two bigger ones, A and B. A plays fair, mines lots of transactions. B is more unfair and just mines empty blocks for the raw reward. Among the crowd of miners, B is doing pretty well - their tiny blocks propagate faster than A's larger blocks which include transactions, so they are getting more bitcoin rewards for the hash rate they put into mining. The community sees B mining empty blocks (or small blocks) as a problem because the network is more valuable if miners actually mine and include transactions - otherwise what is the bitcoin network for?
In the community, there are all these little transactions popping around constantly. These transactions are seen by basically everyone, and mined by nearly everyone. There are a few problems were very occasionally a transaction is lost in a miner's memory, not relayed, or never seen by a fraction of the network. And there could be controversial transactions, like SatoshiDice or 1Enjoy 1Sochi which are spam or immoral or whatever and which some miners don't feel like mining (justified or not - let's say justified, but other miners disagree or don't care). 
The transactions are already in every miners memory, with a few errors or deliberate omissions. All the miners agree to do now is pass around a hash - the correct hash - as if the rest of the block actually had the transactions in it - and an IBLT an inverted bloom lookup table - to the ordered transactions - they agree in advance on a canonical ordering scheme so that you know how to sort the transactions before you hash them. And if the transactions that a given node thinks should be in that block don't seem to be all there (the hash doesn't match the naive canonical ordering you try first), then the IBLT lets you look up super fast which transactions the miner left out - as long as they don't leave out too many. 
If two miners are far apart on their agreement of what needs to be mined, then they can't pass blocks around in this high speed way.*
If that happened, a miner would probably have to fall back to sending the old long format.
Maybe cutting-edge miners will do both - send a big IBLT version which will be confirmed fast by any miners with the patch - and the slower one with transactions for the older miners who don't patch.
* If most of the network - the miners with the patch *do* understand what just got mined, the miners that stay too far behind literally will not understand what the rest of the network is talking about and get extremely lost and really not be very successful at mining. They will be mining on the wrong block, and see larger and larger proof of work from miners which 'helpfully' catch them up with old-style block protocol. They don't have to fork and they could get lucky sometimes, but this could eat their profit away if they don't patch I bet.
* Miners with the patch are looking at the ability to do thousands and thousands of (virtual) transactions per second - which makes the bitcoin network's value go up, which makes the block rewards worth more, even if this takes pressure off of having transaction fees drive the system (instead the emphasis shifts subtly back towards seignorage driving the system, a little bit - from 98% of the reward being seignorage to 99% ;-D  ).
I think Gavin's proposal is exciting and puts into place some serious efficiency gains - no more real worries about 'blockchain size' (it doesn't need to have an actual size limit) if you do it right. Not sure how long the IBLT has to be to pull this off, probably very small though. They could make it 'absurdly big' and it would probably only have to be twice as big - and then never touch it again.

Hard drives are cheap and getting cheaper. 
Technology is taking different curves, Moore's law is for transistor density. A totally different observation is called Kryer's law --
"A PhysOrg.com article by Mark Kryder[4] projected that if hard drives were to continue to progress at their then-current pace of about 40% per year, then in 2020 a two-platter, 2.5-inch disk drive would store approximately 40 terabytes (TB) and cost about $40." (from the Wikipedia article about Mark Kryder)
EDIT: network speeds are more the bottleneck but it should be okay. They do not improve very quickly and it's probably not technology-related but instead government issued artificial monopolies hold us back. There's a common belief that water, power, cable tv are "natural monopolies" when in fact each of those could be served a lot of different ways and a consumer should get to choose which service provider gives them what they need.
Example - water, not a natural monopoly. You could buy drinking water, have it delivered to your house in a 55 gallon drum weekly. Or you could have a small neighborhood water tower and have a truck deliver to that. Or you could use a citywide system. You could have a choice and pay based on cost, service, features.
Or in the case of networking, you could have 4G WiMaX, cable tv, telephone, fiber to the curb up through your sewer line, a mesh network with your neighbors, satellite phone, etc.
There's no need to limit competition for these things - at all.

This is why the only thing that should be taxed is real estate.

I'd do that, make the tax unevadeable, and set aside a small amount of land per person that's tax free. Say .... 1/10th of an acre or so. Enough for your personal home. 
But that's it, any more real estate than that would be taxed. But that'd be the only tax.

At Coinbase you have to get verified to some level before your purchases are truly instant. And I think to do that you have to link a credit card. 
Trying to use a credit card to buy bitcoin never never worked for me. Only having cash in the account seemed to work. I would not recommend trying to do instant buys without the money ready to go in your checking account.
All the delays you're experiencing is because the old money system - credit cards, checking accounts, etc, is riddled with scams and chargebacks and is entirely the legacy system that's messed up. It has these slow downs and delays in order to protect itself from scammers. And the inefficiency is not anything they worry about, that's their customer's problem and where are they going to go? Another bank?
Once you're across and into bitcoin that nonsense goes away (and is replaced with difficult computer security problems, har har! :) but seriously, the problems change - you have to be more vigilant because there is not much in the way of safety nets with bitcoin. But that's what makes it so cool!)

It's an effect called 'The Impossible trinity' 
I'm just going to cut and paste wikipedia ...
The Impossible Trinity or "The Trilemma", in which three policy positions are possible. If a nation were to adopt position a, for example, then it would maintain a fixed exchange rate and allow free capital flows, the consequence of which would be loss of monetary sovereignty.
The Impossible trinity (also known as the Trilemma) is a trilemma in international economics which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:
*    A fixed exchange rate
*    Free capital movement (absence of capital controls)
*    An independent monetary policy
all three of the policy objectives mentioned above cannot be pursued simultaneously. A central bank has to forgo one of the three objectives. Therefore a central bank has three policy combination options.
    a) Fixed Exchange Rate and Free Capital Flow
    b) Independent Monetary Policy and Free Capital Flow
    c) Fixed Exchange Rate and Independent Monetary Policy 
And in this case, China and Russia are choosing:
    c) Fixed Exchange Rate and Independent Monetary Policy 
so they can't have:
*    Free capital movement (absence of capital controls)

If I completely stop spending my bitcoin, I can get these over to long term capital gains.

Yeah it's such a red herring on the prosecutor's part. Pleading the fifth has to do with you not providing evidence against yourself. It's the prosecutor themselves that claim a connection to a Silk Road server in Iceland to the defendant. The fifth amendment comes from the time when the Puritans were tortured into claiming what religion they followed and they brought the right against self-incrimination with them. It prevents evidence that's coerced from people from being admissable in court.
The fourth protects against unreasonable search and seizure. 
The fifth doesn't really protect your "stuff". You could have falsified accounting books and notes (your papers). Your stuff is protected by the fourth amendment.
(Side note -- Maybe if your "stuff" is protected by a password (something you know) then that can be more of a grey area. I personally lean on the side of the idea that your encrypted material, protected by something you know - would act as testimony, and in this case the grey area resolves in the defendant's presumption of innocence advantage. That just in general a defendant doesn't have to help the prosecutor convict them!)
No one is pleading anything - the prosecutor bringing the fifth amendment into this as if it was a trap is a false choice. It's not this or that.
The fourth amendment protects the defendants stuff, and the fifth protects them and their testimony and what they say (or choose not to say really).

You're setting yourself up to be a late adopter if bitcoin does well. Currency and it's value is a herd mentality thing. 
You might think bitcoin is not going to be the future. In which case, do NOT buy any or get involved.
If you think bitcoin will be the future, then decide if you want to be ahead of this herd or just join it in the middle when it's more fun to use.

Ah rats, I wish they'd interview me.
I would have given a much more fun interview. But anyway, for Apples' store I would have said to her question:
"Apple's move is a great peace offering to bitcoin fans. Wallet apps should come right out and make Apple offerings, those look like they have gotten a green light if they can respect local laws. A business like "bit legal" might be able to give good country-level indicators to the market about what kind of restrictions are in place in different countries.
For Apple investors who are thinking about the generous cut the app store gets (30%?) of in store purchases, I would say don't worry, Apple is not cutting their own throat with this.
For app developers that want to have in-game purchases with bitcoin for apps. First off, Apple hasn't set that up, and if they did they'd want a 30% cut. So, yeah. Or maybe slightly less but no promises. It's probably a bit tricky for Apple to get an API going but, lol, they could talk to BitPay or Coinbase and I'm SURE they would get their ass down to Cupertino and help.
Peace out, bitcoin!!"

They could go for a restructuring and make private miners go one way and their private ASIC farm go another, under separate management.
So you can chase this forever.
I care but I'm not in charge of GHash.io and I'm not in charge of mining rigs that point at them. It might be a good example of a game of 'Chicken' - a well known game theory problem similar to the Prisoner's Dilemma. 
The game here is that miners know they shouldn't go over 51% or they hurt bitcoin and their own profits. But on the other hand, ghash.io is super popular and charges no fees. So they make, what 1%, more profit if they point at it.
Or maybe the game is 'Not my problem (Lazy)' since I thought they could point to p2pool and not blow up bitcoin.

It's because the hash rate is increasing so quickly. 3600 coins per day would be if blocks did take 10 minutes to find. But 10 minutes is like a target so actually it's only taking like 7 or 8 minutes to find a block, so more coins found each day.

Yep, great article. Bitcoin's price has to go way way up. It has to start as an incredibly speculative store of value. If it does well, then it can become a medium of exchange. Once you can't even notice the volatility in it's little fluctionations, it can be a unit of account. As the price rises, it becomes more and more usable as money.

My understanding is that the Marshalls just don't want to manage a whole bunch of offers. They want like 25 to 20 odd lots and be done with it. Probably 10 lots of 2000 bitcoins and 10 lots of 3000 bitcoins. So a handful of people to check out and send and receive wire transfers from, something they can wrap up inside of a week.
It amounts to, yes, deep pocketed big players getting yet another advantage over the little guy, but whatever. 
I mean, ideally, they would sell all the way down to 1/100ths of a bitcoin as an item. Then I could put in a bid at $5, $6, $7, and so on and I could find out for myself what the larger bids must have sold for (eg, if my $5 and $6 bids get nothing but I get a hit on the $7 dollar bid).
Then FOIA or not, I could ballpark for myself what people paid.
Yeah, they don't want that. The fun of this game is that no one will have much of an idea what was bid, unless they are also a big player.

Not sure, I still think even 100,000 GPUs might still be very small.
I think a single Antminer S1 would have more hashing than all of those GPUs.
Assuming something like a ATI 4 series card, which is under a megahash, but there are some ATI 5 cards which go over a megahash.
I was eyeballing the stats on this page:
and I have no idea which pages might be scams but on eBay they seem to vary from $300 to about $1500 for an Antminer S1....
and then the whole bitcoin mining network of all nodes is probably into the billions of dollars in ASICs, so .... I think all of the GPUs combined might still be under 1% and maybe fractions of that of the bitcoin ASIC network.

I am actually completely sympathetic to your skepticism so don't take this the wrong way. 
First, to support your point -- I think that very small, very expensive things, which are sold and ready to go -- if those are sold in-person - those things probably it would be a good idea to wait for confirmations. (Jewelry, hand bags, expensive designer shoes, and ready to wear designer clothes.)
Even then, some people have done some math and feel that the chances of a double-spend on things that cost less than millions of dollars - with the way the network propagates transactions very quickly - that if the spend looks very normal and has an appropriate fee attached - it will probably confirm. 
I think though that Peter Todd (hope I'm not remembering the wrong guy!) had a counter argument that 0-confirms are absolutely untrustworthy and was floating the idea of a mining pool that you could secretly relay double-spend transactions to. (So that supports your concern that waiting for confirms is vital because attackers really do exist.)
But other things?
My suits are tailored, I have to wait days.
Big TVs are huge, I would have to pull up a truck and wait like 1/2 hour at Best Buy for them to load em into the back. The kind of TVs that fit in my car are only $500/1 bitcoin or so in price. I'd still have to get it loaded etc. 
When I bought my house filling out paperwork took quite a while, the other side was in China. We spent most of our time getting English documents translated into Chinese (like a week). The escrow process took a while too, several hours. Many more hours before cashed arrived at my credit union to pay off the mortgage. 
Furniture is normally delivered. IKEA has some flat-pack assemble yourself stuff, but some people have that delivered too.
If I bought a yacht? It would have moorage, it would be delivered by a skipper. It's registered with the state. You could find it on a radar map. How would anyone steal that??
There's plenty of time on expensive stuff to not hand over the items. 
I forgot to add - the TV is a good example. A really expensive TV is probably not going to be paid for in cash, but if you wanted to use cash, they'd probably have a manager come look over the bills for counterfeit etc. If you paid with a credit card, they probably wouldn't bat an eye if the amount went through and you had ID. (Maybe take it in the back and photocopy it). A month later, they could get a chargeback from the credit card. They'd probably physically get the TV back, but maybe not if it was stolen cards. With bitcoin, it's like cash, without the counterfeiting. I mean, it's really good money. At point of sale, you could use BitPay/Coinbase, pay about a 1% fee and get it same as cash. Someplace large like Best Buy for sure could arrange a better than 1% deal probably. They even, hypothetically could just take bitcoin directly and do all the currency stuff themselves, but MtGox shows that it's dangerous to process millions in bitcoin unless you are truly an expert.

Someday it will be necessary to have a little bit of bitcoin just as a float in order to do a good deal of business on the open market. The average Fortune 500 will have about ~10 bitcoin floating in a hot wallet and about 40 more in cold storage for larger purchases. 
Bitcoin will be a necessity for most businesses, like a postal address, a website, a catalog to order from, marketing and advertising expenses, a telephone, and a fax machine. Some businesses will get by just like others do without some of these expenses, but they don't have to, it'll just be a cost-benefit trade off. 
Payment processors like BitPay and Coinbase are holding back the day a little bit that businesses *have* to have their own bitcoin hotwallet. But it's hard to say if they're going to be the be-all end-all. They should do pretty well though.

Bitcoins are (kind of, but not super-really) a means of storing value ... and a medium of exchange.
It's meaningless that inside bitcoin we have these limited counters if the world of people outside of bitcoin don't want them. We can trade amongst ourselves but ...
Anyway, the assets outside the bitcoin system will be used, over time - maybe - to buy bitcoins, slowly. If it happens very slowly, then you might have been better off using your time / energy / fiat money to get land / skills / education / develop businesses and products - and then do like them and buy bitcoin if you want to.
We don't want to make the mistake of assuming that just because there'll be 21 million bitcoin that you can divide the world's wealth into 21 million pieces and if you own one bitcoin - point to the corresponding share of world wealth and say 'MINE'. 
But anyway, bitcoins are cool and I do think the world will value them more highly in the future :)

I think it's a tactic - a way to make sure something sticks.
I'm not saying he didn't do it, or isn't guilty of that (sorry defenders of DPR), but I personally don't like the idea of unbundling these various crimes and coming up with new charges on the fly.
If I was a judge, I would make them take the Maryland case to my own court, and I would toss out new charges that are being made up on the fly. Let's get this case over with.
A common everyday man sense of justice needs to be seen and performed or else the courts are not fulfilling a good social function.  If people wind up cyncially thinking that prosecutors can make up any rules they want and make up new charges as they go and pile it on and separate issues out so you're guilty of something somewhere if the first crack at you doesn't work - eventually people get cynical and engage in jury nullification and the like.

You could take the private key (begins with 5) and break that up into pieces to be signed in any m-of-n way you like. Then recombine, get back a single private key (begins with 5) and move coins.

Banks not liking settling dollar accounts through the New York Fed - because then the Fed pokes its nose into where the money is going and it starts to become a foreign policy game and you never know when the Fed will stop some payment (in dollars) from one bank to another outside the United States, because the Fed claims that kind of extraterritorial power over dollars.
Well, the banking cartel says (figuratively): "Screw THAT! (pause) Is there some way we can trade dollars around, even though we don't trust each other, and settle up accounts, without having to go through the New York Fed?"
(Keeping dollars outside the US is what a "euro" dollar is.)
Banks are busy lending each other "euro" dollars but aren't able to settle accounts out very well without going through the real Fed, like the NY Fed.  They hate that.  The NY Fed might keep their money or at least intervene sometimes as a matter of foreign policy when deciding who gets to settle up with whom.
The problem is bad enough that they are mulling the idea of a full-reserve bank, located in Ireland, to hold dollars just to settle up accounts.
Problem is (and the reason it would have to be full-reserve) is that none of these banks trust each other. "Maybe," they think, "can we use the blockchain to track assets like "euro" dollars and trade those tokens around?"
The international banking cartel is more likely to try to settle international accounts on the blockchain than to have a full-reserve "euro" dollar denominated centralized bank located in Ireland ;) -- and it is a banking cartel, because it's membership is limited and as a cartel they effect price controls -- they set the price of money.
Also, these "euro" dollars are messing up the value of actual dollars. The unit of account purpose of money is getting all messed up and becoming more and more outside the Fed's control.

That is a great point, it could be a lot less than that by an order of magnitude, depends on how you see it.
~ a few million wallets at Coinbase which offers wallets to US people with bank accounts,a few million Internet-connected people in the USA. I'm just looking for order of magnitude level accuracy.
But globally somewhere between 1-10 million people have bitcoin wallets probably, and about 4 billion people have Internet access. Sounds like maybe 1 in 1000.
Thanks, so wherever people want to set the numerator and denominator knobs, you can get answers probably not greater than 1 in 100 but not more rare than 1 in 4000.

Keep your head down and wait for it to blow over?
Kidding, cold storage, nothing.
A node, upgrade if you want.
Mining, mine on the new fork if you think more value and use will go with the new fork. What is everyone else doing too? If it's not cutting your own throat, then if 90, 99, or 99% of the hashpower is going off on a fork, you might as well follow it.  I have to think that miners need to be aware of both old and new blockchains and run some live "game theory" on hypothetical balances on each side of the fork - to see if someone is gaming the system and winding up with loads more coins on one side or the other, probably by stuffing transactions into blocks to see what makes it through or doesn't on each side, as part of exploiting a switchover.  But before any switchover, miners telegraph their intentions to switch - and all switch together (in theory). In reality, you can't get everyone to switch, so you have to wait for some percentage before it's a good idea. Some percentages are non-starters: like 10% want to put their hashpower at new fork - nope. 50% - nope. 75% - not really worth it... 90% - getting warmer, maybe. 99% - getting towards a certainty... 99.9% - might as well switch, because the low-hashpower side of the fork can get blown up, pinned down, double-spent, etc.

Yeah I agree, it's nice of him to have it open. 
Because this is something anyone could do - if he hadn't done it then one of the things that the big 3 or 4 mining groups could do is share amongst themselves but not share with smaller operations, in order to drive the little guys out of business, which would centralize things more. It doesn't have to be a conspiracy, it's just easier to communicate with a few site admins than with everyone...
Hopefully super high speed things are coming to bitcoin itself (like the IBLT, but anything better is good too) - I assume the IBLT would just be one way of sending info at high speed and like a method type, where the original bitcoin could be the first, and IBLT the second (or third?), if someone invents something better, that one can be next.

That sounds like a tough place.
Also I've read that a lot of the remittance problem is that the elites who run Nepal don't really work hard on making it a good place to do business, like roads and electricity. They just tax the heck out of remittances. And because there isn't enough local goods, people import a lot (and imported goods are just competition to locally produced goods and local jobs). 
So kind of a vicious cycle. No good local jobs, go overseas, get remittance money, send money home, no good products to buy, import products ... Eventually it hollows the place out.

I think it was slightly unlikely ... eg, most people who were not Cypherpunks might have come up with a Proof of Stake system, or a Ripple like registration system.
Cypherpunks knew about trying to do Proof of Work to control spam, so you had to be kind of inside that group to think of bitcoin (probably).
I think that bitcoin is somewhat obvious if you are inside the circle of Cypherpunks and what they were concerned about - activism, anonymity, cryptography, libertarianism, anti-State paternalism, anti-Big Brother, moving money without state control, etc. And if you knew the technology and political history of e-gold and other things.

The part I didn't understand 2 years ago about Ron Paul and his End the Fed nonsense...
Was that I thought everyone knew that the Fed created money out of thin air, by buying T bills from Goldman Sachs. Everyone knew this, right? And was okay with it, right? No? People actually don't know that!
But aside from that, it's possible that people in the Fed *are* getting away with shady things because it's unaudited. They *might* be selling their personal 1/2 million dollar homes to the Fed for 1.5 million. Then reselling those properties secretly back to their friends for 1/2 million. All kinds of shady things might be happening.
It's impossible to say without an audit.

First off, you have to start with a commitment to honesty and to not deceive people. You have to know why you're using a log scale instead of a linear scale. I think, personally, that a log scale is very honest in that it makes bitcoin's exponential price growth look like no big deal. It hides though the fact that on some parts of the curve if you buy at a peak and look over at the next trough, you might be looking at a 90% loss, which the long curve makes look like no big deal. But a beginner is going to feel very badly burned.
Essentially the reason to use a log scale is that the changes up and down in it represent percentages instead of absolute differences. So a log scale tells you the truth about, like for example, bitcoin price - if the price goes from $100 to $200 to $400, it doubled in price at each jump and the distance is the same on a log scale. At any point there, you could put in your money and double it. Then when it goes the other way and unwinds, $400 $200 $100, at each point, your money gets cut in half.

A different thing, in a way.

So if you used the new Mycelium usb entropy generator, and it prints out a clear text private key ...The randomness of that key, that should be pretty random, and pretty sure there.
But if you then then turn and print that image file out onto one of these copiers with an embedded hard drive ...
Then those keys could be read later from the internal drive (like when it's sold as surplus equipment or sent out for maintenance)
I support the Indiegogo for the new Mycelium randomness generator - but it must be used as part of a larger secure system:

Is there any system, where a manufacturer, say General Motors, could have a pool of bitcoin and then as like a "title" or "keys" to a car - put out a 0.0001 sized transaction, where OP_RETURN is the serial # of the car - and then whoever has that satoshi, owns the car? 
I'm not sure how to move these concept bits around. 10 minute confirmation delays are not how car ignitions and door locks work either.  But a 10 minute delay to pass ownership is fine by me.
I get that, legally, that's not how cars are bought and sold. Car titles are not bearer bonds. Yes there would be errors and thefts etc. 
But I am wondering how we can use colored coins in a simplified hypothetical. 
How can an object watch the blockchain and know that it is owned and controlled by a few thousand specific satoshis? Does it search the blockchain for something it's own private key signed earlier and then follow and trace that to a new "owner" who can prove it by signing something?
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:14:46

Using bitcoin this way is like taking a small amount of gold and turning it into a very flat sheet of gold foil, and then writing "stock certificate" on it.
So the amounts of bitcoin they need to do this are very very very small, but when companies here there and everywhere start to do it, pretty soon these tiny uses make bitcoin scarce-ish.

But that's something that holders of bitcoin implicitly accept. Think of it as a gift to miners from holders, in order to encourage those that choose to use bitcoin as a currency.
I'm not saying it's not there. It's that those who hold bitcoin are paying it, and they don't mind, because it's implicit in the price and inherent in what bitcoin is and how it relates to the world and the resources outside bitcoin that pay for bitcoin (like mining and electricity and ASICs). Buyers know all that, and freely paid for it.

Well, some things that would improve fungibility don't need a hard fork, but they would need a bit of thinking.
One part is to allow some of a group of people to sign a transaction (effectively, ring signatures) and to let that signing happen passively - some way for people to publish some helpful public key material (to the blockchain presumably) and have that be used by others to do mixing with their key too, so that some plausible deniability can come into play. Crudely, you can do this now with something bad like SSSS, but it would be better to build it in - could be done by just a quorum of wallet software.
Next the outputs, you would have to grow them quite a bit, and you don't have to have a hard fork, but you could do like Monero and have outputs fractionalize out so that when you make a purchase starting from 100 bitcoin as input, and trying to pay someone else 23.44 in bitcoin - instead of paying them 23.44 and getting simple change of 76.56, you pay out 20, 70, 3, 6, .4, .5, .4, and .6 and ring signature pay the whole pile and leave people confused in the block chain analysis about what went where. You could make it a rule that the most significant digit (the 70 and the 20) have to be broken up into unit sides (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, and then the other pieces could stay their weird sizes, or order that all the pieces always get smaller and shard ever on downwards, rarely? never? coming back and coalescing, or maybe up one level at a time, and only 10:1 back up as a single transaction, but with some wacky rules about swapping them for someone else's coins?)

Yeah sell walls are above the current price and act as resistance to a price rise (but maybe set things up for a breakout potentially upwards, or a collapse of confidence, downwards since it signals an intent to push things down).
And buy walls are underneath the current price and represent support, in as long as the buy wall is there, it represents an intent to buy at that price, which is bullish, but could be pulled and in a breakout price freefalls for a while downwards. 
When you have a lot of support and evenly matched resistance, buyers and sellers, the price moves in a channel, usually between walls or zones of resistance. 
If things go in a channel long enough, there tends to be a breakout, up or down, depending on which side has more resources to throw at it.

Yeah do you think the devices ability to make a few satoshi is something that would be useful to hook into, like a /dev/bitcoin kind of output?
I wonder if a trickle charge of satoshis to /dev/bitcoin is better or worse than just having a wallet that fills /dev/bitcoin.  (By analogy)  Not sure...

I don't see how regulations and laws are going to stop greedy bastards. I guess it's worth trying? Central Banks regulate the issuance of currency going one way, and then groups like George Soros break the banks when they try to fight reality. Like didn't he attack some peg the British Pound had and John Major had to give up and let it float freely? Something like that. It's like are these speculators attacking things or are they just not so blind to reality, thinking you can force pegs on currencies rather than let reality make them freely float. This latest scandal is probably some game where they tried to fix the rates one way or the other, probably against the powers-that-be, and are being punished for it, because they're inside the System's Circus Ring of Trust and Punishment.
 
Bitcoin might make the fight against the usual currencies even more unwinnable -- cool Juris Doctor graduation paper I saw linked the other day .... suggesting the IMF should get a bitcoin war chest or else - worst case, they may not be able to defend their currencies against bitcoin...
Hilariously fun to read. Take with a grain of salt, because I estimate the odds against the scenario it describes at beyond 1000:1 -- but never tell me the odds! :)

So malware in the phone can't sign transactions ... but it could modify a transaction once you decide to spend?
So simple malware or something malicious that tries to steal private keys off the phone won't work (one key is not enough), but sophisticated malware that modifies live transactions would?

Probably make it so that blocks have a predictable size for planning purposes, prevent some kind of resource exhaustion attack.

Well I thought that at some point, eventually, I have to pay you though. So you can pay other people.
Do you think the architecture, like if you were Overstock, is to have thousands of mostly buyers using bitcoin on the left, but chunked into groups, such that their spending -- is balanced on the right hand side by say, a few big suppliers (like 10 big suppliers) and dividing them out, so that pools of buyers A, A', A" etc, go through B, to get matched up to big sellers C, D, E, who want to receive bitcoins as payments?  And they're all chunked out like that so that they mostly never have to settle up?

Who knows, but there's always some anti-bitcoin nutter that thinks the transaction volumes are meaningless. But I would contend that with bitcoin days destroyed, something is actually happening. It may or may not be commerce, it might be just a wallet reoganization or movement from cold storage to a hot wallet. Etc.

Yeah they find wedge issues - anything that people won't compromise on, be it gun control, abortion, prayer in schools, etc, and use those to keep people divided. They can't help but be divided along wedge issue lines because those are just simply things people really won't compromise on. But the overall effect is to exploit the differences to get power over others.

Oh maybe what I'm thinking of is not possible.
I was thinking something like - buyer A, buys a coffee for 0.0100 bitcoin from their own normal address into a transaction that's mixed with merchant B, who offers to pay a 0.0001 fee for the transaction. The output goes to an address controlled only by B.
That's not possible and easy?
I just realized it is possible, but A still controls their own 0.0100 bitcoin funds and could try a double-spend. It has to be a 2-of-2 wallet from the beginning. Hmm.

I think you're right that things about bitcoin like that pretty much can't be changed unless it's a clear crisis and a vast majority of people can believe that a fix will make things much better, and if you have enough bitcoin it starts to really be a big deal to you how things get solved (like, you wouldn't want the rules about how many bitcoins total will ever exist to change etc)
@_date: 2014-10-15 19:33:42
No worries. I don't want to put you off of the idea that there could be very fruitful territory in thinking about how mining is done - because people would really love to see a crack/break/speedup if it's possible/economical.
People came up with p2pool, ways of splitting out the nonces, pre-image attacks (efficiency gains) against SHA256 - like noticing that leading 0's might not be really as secure as if Satoshi had chosen trailing 0's, things like that.
There are many interesting corners and cases in bitcoin to chew on..
EDIT: Not to be too mean to the researchers - but here's a paper where their mining improvement parts seem good and their changing the mining reward schedule is much more debateable.   So you can have all kinds of mixed things in the research.

Since forever, you could go to bitfinex and short it actively, or short it more passively by having bitcoin but lend it out for shorts.
(But bitfinex has had a hack lately so your mileage may vary.)
I've heard a lot of the Chinese exchanges allow shorting too, maybe with leverage, that's unclear lately.

Yes - like Neo&amp;Bee was a real misfire. I was turned off of them because I saw them spending a lot of money on fancy offices or rollout parties instead of actually buying and selling bitcoin and working with merchants.
So I would have preferred to see this bitcoin story: a guy buying and selling bitcoins for Euros in a small marketplace. Around him springs up a bunch of merchants, mostly food shops, which accept bitcoin (and just turn it into Euros at the end of the day with the guy outside or something). Then he has to hire a partner so that there's someone in the market area from fairly early in the morning, like 9am, til pretty late, like 9pm, all days of the week and more people on holidays. Eventually he's got a good thing going and 2-3 blocks around everyone is using bitcoin and it's hot in summer so he rented a room above a shop to sleep in the hot afternoons. Some time later, he and a computer laptop repair shop near the square got together and have found a mutually workable situation where they buy/sell bitcoins and pass that on and provide secure workstations and suggestions on how to secure bitcoins as free advice for people who come in. Next thing you know, they've made more in bitcoin appreciation than on the laptops. They've installed an air conditioning unit and have bought some chairs. They're moving this place more towards a hangout and social space. Things are generally going upscale in their market... and *then* they decide to open Neo&amp;Bee because some people want *them* to run their bitcoin bank accounts, make loans in fiat funded by bitcoin, etc.
If that had been their story, I probably would have invested. My point is, I too would rather see a small area all using bitcoin together.
I think there's a London bitcoin area where people hawk and buy and sell bitcoins out loud in a little market. I think there was a place in the Netherlands and in Berlin Germany where bitcoins have more use in a day to day way.

Does it work over IPv6 so that things could bounce around all over the place and you'd never have any idea or even the barest sliver of hope to know what's connecting to what?

Check out the Better Business Bureau, they have a guide to Charitable Giving that has like 20 points for how charities should be run. This is from their site:
STANDARDS FOR CHARITABLE ACCOUNTABILITY
GOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT
The governing board has the ultimate oversight authority for any charitable organization. This section of the standards seeks to ensure that the volunteer board is active, independent and free of self-dealing. To meet these standards, the organization shall have:
1. A board of directors that provides adequate oversight of the charity's operations and its staff. Indication of adequate oversight includes, but is not limited to, regularly scheduled appraisals of the CEO's performance, evidence of disbursement controls such as board approval of the budget, fund raising practices, establishment of a conflict of interest policy, and establishment of accounting procedures sufficient to safeguard charity finances.
2. A board of directors with a minimum of five voting members.
3. A minimum of three evenly spaced meetings per year of the full governing body with a majority in attendance, with face-to-face participation. A conference call of the full board can substitute for one of the three meetings of the governing body. For all meetings, alternative modes of participation are acceptable for those with physical disabilities.
4. Not more than one or 10% (whichever is greater) directly or indirectly compensated person(s) serving as voting member(s) of the board. Compensated members shall not serve as the board's chair or treasurer.
[Publicly soliciting churches and other houses of worship: see the Implementation Guide for further information about the application of this standard.]
5. No transaction(s) in which any board or staff members have material conflicting interests with the charity resulting from any relationship or business affiliation. Factors that will be considered when concluding whether or not a related party transaction constitutes a conflict of interest and if such a conflict is material, include, but are not limited to: any arm's length procedures established by the charity; the size of the transaction relative to like expenses of the charity; whether the interested party participated in the board vote on the transaction; if competitive bids were sought and whether the transaction is one-time, recurring or ongoing.
MEASURING EFFECTIVENESS
An organization should regularly assess its effectiveness in achieving its mission. This section seeks to ensure that an organization has defined, measurable goals and objectives in place and a defined process in place to evaluate the success and impact of its program(s) in fulfilling the goals and objectives of the organization and that also identifies ways to address any deficiencies. To meet these standards, a charitable organization shall:
6. Have a board policy of assessing, no less than every two years, the organization's performance and effectiveness and of determining future actions required to achieve its mission.
7. Submit to the organization's governing body, for its approval, a written report that outlines the results of the aforementioned performance and effectiveness assessment and recommendations for future actions.
This section of the standards seeks to ensure that the charity spends its funds honestly, prudently and in accordance with statements made in fund raising appeals. To meet these standards, the charitable organization shall:
Please note that standards 8 and 9 have different denominators.
8. Spend at least 65% of its total expenses on program activities.
Formula for Standard 8:
Total Program Service Expenses 	  	should be at least 65%
Total Expenses
9. Spend no more than 35% of related contributions on fund raising. Related contributions include donations, legacies, and other gifts received as a result of fund raising efforts.
Formula for Standard 9:
Total Fund Raising Expenses 	  	should be no more than 35%
Total Related Contributions
10. Avoid accumulating funds that could be used for current program activities. To meet this standard, the charity's unrestricted net assets available for use should not be more than three times the size of the past year's expenses or three times the size of the current year's budget, whichever is higher.
[Meeting certain public disclosure requirements described in the Implementation Guide may enable a charity to satisfy this standard.]
An organization that does not meet Standards 8, 9 and/or 10 may provide evidence to demonstrate that its use of funds is reasonable. The higher fund raising and administrative costs of a newly created organization, donor restrictions on the use of funds, exceptional bequests, a stigma associated with a cause and environmental or political events beyond an organization's control are among factors which may result in expenditures that are reasonable although they do not meet the financial measures cited in these standards.
11. Make available to all, on request, complete annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When total annual gross income exceeds $500,000*, these statements should be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. For charities whose annual gross income is less than $500,000*, a review by a certified public accountant is sufficient to meet this standard. For charities whose annual gross income is less than $250,000*, an internally produced, complete financial statement is sufficient to meet this standard.
*Note that new financial statement thresholds for Standard 11 are effective for fiscal years ending 12/31/2011 and thereafter.
12. Include in the financial statements a breakdown of expenses (e.g., salaries, travel, postage, etc.) that shows what portion of these expenses was allocated to program, fund raising, and administrative activities. If the charity has more than one major program category, the schedule should provide a breakdown for each category.
13. Accurately report the charity's expenses, including any joint cost allocations, in its financial statements. For example, audited or unaudited statements which inaccurately claim zero fund raising expenses or otherwise understate the amount a charity spends on fund raising, and/or overstate the amount it spends on programs will not meet this standard.
14. Have a board-approved annual budget for its current fiscal year, outlining projected expenses for major program activities, fund raising, and administration.
FUND RAISING AND INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS
A fund raising appeal is often the only contact a donor has with a charity and may be the sole impetus for giving. This section of the standards seeks to ensure that a charity's representations to the public are accurate, complete and respectful. To meet these standards, the charitable organization shall:
15. Have solicitations and informational materials, distributed by any means, that are accurate, truthful and not misleading, both in whole and in part. Appeals that omit a clear description of program(s) for which contributions are sought will not meet this standard.
A charity should also be able to substantiate that the timing and nature of its expenditures are in accordance with what is stated, expressed, or implied in the charity's solicitations.
16. Have an annual report available to all, on request, that includes:
    the organization's mission statement,
    a summary of the past year's program service accomplishments,
    a roster of the officers and members of the board of directors,
    financial information that includes (i) total income in the past fiscal year, (ii) expenses in the same program, fund raising and administrative categories as in the financial statements, and (iii) ending net assets.
17. Include on any charity websites that solicit contributions, the same information that is recommended for annual reports, as well as the mailing address of the charity and electronic access to its most recent IRS Form 990.
18. Address privacy concerns of donors by
    providing in written appeals, at least annually, a means (e.g., such as a check off box) for both new and continuing donors to inform the charity if they do not want their name and address shared outside the organization, and
    providing a clear, prominent and easily accessible privacy policy on any of its websites that tells visitors (i) what information, if any, is being collected about them by the charity and how this information will be used, (ii) how to contact the charity to review personal information collected and request corrections, (iii) how to inform the charity (e.g., a check off box) that the visitor does not wish his/her personal information to be shared outside the organization, and (iv) what security measures the charity has in place to protect personal information.
19. Clearly disclose how the charity benefits from the sale of products or services (i.e., cause-related marketing) that state or imply that a charity will benefit from a consumer sale or transaction. Such promotions should disclose, at the point of solicitation:
    the actual or anticipated portion of the purchase price that will benefit the charity (e.g., 5 cents will be contributed to abc charity for every xyz company product sold),
    the duration of the campaign (e.g., the month of October),
    any maximum or guaranteed minimum contribution amount (e.g., up to a maximum of $200,000).
20. Respond promptly to and act on complaints brought to its attention by the BBB Wise Giving Alliance and/or local BBBs about fund raising practices, privacy policy violations and/or other issues.

They're different things. 
Ripple is an IOU token passing system.
The movements of Bitcoins (values in a ledger) are value themselves and need no backing or counterparty trust. Like gold, bearer bonds, aluminum ingots, etc.
You could use a Ripple gateway, you just buy Ripples and go for it.  You can use Ripples to transfer USD value to Bitstamp (at least you used to be able to, haven't done it)
I think bitcoin is an easier system to get going on with situations where people don't trust each other and we're talking about everyday levels of value. Add escrow if you want a layer of protection which may or may not work...

I wonder if there's a way to prove you voted, but not who you voted for.
A way for everyone to know how many votes went to each one, because you can see each vote ... but no way for those who received the votes to know who voted for them.
So you can see Votes for A and Votes for B, but you can't tell if any individual voted for A or B specificially but you do know they voted, and A and B can't tell who voted for them. But all the individual voters know that each person voted and was in control of their vote.... interesting problem.
Anyway, an interesting way to end those damn Diebold shenanigans. And then have to find a way to keep malware from stealing votes ;)

I agree with you, but ... pretend there was malpractice ... and I do e-discovery to find out what details of surgery and follow-up care killed grandma. Suspecting a botched surgery and a coverup, I request the records for that day.
They produce them, I say - hmm this hash doesn't match this external thing. They correct me and say - yes that's true - thats' because all of the patients seen in clinic that day had all of their records hashed.
Okay, I need all of those other records, so I can hash them and confirm that none of them were changed in the slightest.
Naturally, if the hash for all of them as a collection has changed, would show that something's changed, maybe not grandma's record... but of course wouldn't show what specifically had changed... 
They can't or probably wouldn't share those other patient's records in cleartext (maybe they could encrypt them first, then hash them... so maybe they could share 'encrypted' records with me. Hmm.)
Okay - would they provide all of the documents, encrypted, and I could verify for myself that the key I'm given decrypts mine, and then the hash of the whole pile of encrypted things (including mine) - is still the same, therefore, unless I think that they can generate hash algorithm collisions on demand, that they haven't tampered with things...
Okay, that's doable.

Technology is political. We want to build peer-to-peer money without central bankers controlling who can talk to who, invading our privacy, deciding where money can flow, and how much is created, and who gets it first, and without any barriers to entry that we can manage.
In the face of that, bitcoin is going to be attacked. So anything that helps us be true to the original vision is good. In the meantime, there are some ways we've had to clip bitcoin back as we discover attacks - like dust spam, people encoding tons of other data into the blockchain like graffiti or porn ... 
In the end, miners will mine whatever they want that other miners take as valid. It's in their best interest to have a market that's flat and fair, because then the tokens they're rewarded with (bitcoins) are more valuable.
Most of us want the same thing, it's just so hard to get there. Once we have it, we can't let go. It's going to take some thinking to keep bitcoin from getting too cramped to be useful, because usability means value.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:29:18
Hmm. Well, they are going to see it as being akin to spinning a roulette wheel, as it's a pure speculation play on the future of bitcoin with zillion to 1 odds.
It's closer in spirit to to A typical stock either pays dividends, so it's either worth buying where you trade a chunk of cash for a stream of income, or more tax-smartly, it's a company which is committed to growing and only if it runs out of ideas - will it buy back it's own stock (raising the price by making it's stock scarce) - and if you want "income" from that stock, you'd sell a chunk.
So they're going to look at bitcoin, which doesn't pay dividends, which doesn't have capital assets literally at work giving it value, and see it as a speculative commodity, at best, like GLD (gold ETF).
For someone like me or you it might be a good idea. My retirement is basically set. And I have a long ways to go before, so why not take (a tiny amount of net worth) and make some longshot bets on some black swans? :)

bitcoins aren't really coins in whole amounts, they are values pooled from inputs flowing to outputs...
As for taint, it's tainted only in the eyes of investigators who want to make correlations as you say, it's not inherent in the pooled value of a wallet, it's just in the mind of whoever is tracking down where coins have come from and gone, and they usually just have to make informed guesses.

Yes like a private network is to the Internet, very useful, very common. They could try to make a proof of stake like system like that, with permissioned entry.
If the US got rid of it's worries about 'money laundering' and allowed bearer bonds again, a lot of this would be a lot easier.
Then companies like NASDAQ could trade stock internationally and market a colored coin NASDAQ wallet that allowed trades of stock and bitcoin really easily.
But anyway, a lot of the lunch that bitcoin is eating is caused by the regulatory friction created by the current system, so bitcoin can only get so far in these markets before it winds up tied up in the same red tape.

Anyone know if Coinbase has a letter of whatever, solidarity, or a fund if we can join in?
I'm a Coinbase customer, I've paid my taxes.
But of course Coinbase by itself, has no idea what I've bought and sold in bitcoin -- they can't possibly truly know this. 
So say I've been on exchanges with those coins, or some have gone to cold storage, or things have gone to different coins, or out and back, up/down and sideways.
Just from the Coinbase records you can't tell if someone is or isn't paying their taxes. 
I think the IRS should handle this the old fashioned way - do you have an unexplained high end lifestyle? And no obvious source of income? Then investigate.
If the trail leads to Coinbase, then subpoena Coinbase for that one person's records of account activity.

LN/Stroem sets up a banking like system, potentially, where people just point to big payment partners. Like how I have cash now, along with a couple of bank cards. That'd be the setup. We'd never settle because I'd be paid in bitcoin into the credit side of a payment channel, and then when I spend I'd spend against the payment channel, and it might take forever to ever settle out to the bitcoin blockchain. We get VISA all over again though.
LN/Stroem seems to be the way out of sizing/scaling worries.
You still have underlying bitcoin (as e-cash) though. 
What I'd like to see is a way for us to tade off the partners in a payment channel, but make it unprovable who/what paid to who/where, like a vast mixer. Hard to do without moon math. And naive blockchain reading might make it really tough to tell what's going on, because you don't know what's being promised and signed, off-blockchain.

I think he says pretty directly that people are overly optimistic about technology - that the Internet will fizzle because people have nothing to say to each other and that the internet won't have more impact than the fax machine.

In not very extreme temperatures, a heat pump is good, like Arizona or Southern California or wherever.  For very cold weather, most heat pumps have electric resistance heaters as backups.
Everywhere I've had a home in the Pacific Northwest where electric power is cheap, a lot of homes will have baseboard heaters. 
For places like the PNW, a bitcoin miner, used in the cold winter seasons, could do the job of a space heater.
It's more efficient to keep 1 or 2 rooms warm than a whole home when it's truly cold.
With maybe a radical change in design, where they could run really hot, a bitcoin miner could heat (or at least warm) the water in a hot water heater. Most CPUs are not designed to run really hot though.

I don't blame you. If you didn't do it, someone else would.
Governments are obviously going to be building their own databases of whitelists, blacklists, and what not.
If you want to make a great big data warehouse and track all this stuff, go for it. 
If you can make a CV system where I can take groups I LOVE like the Mycelium team, and groups I dislike like (making this up, Coinbase) -- 
and then let me judge a given wallet by the distance and percent of coins from Mycelium versus the distance and percent of coins from Coinbase's hot wallet - then I could use that to maybe look someone over to know if they're 'on my side'.
Then the Feds could use this to measure how far from Coinbase (good guys to them) over to Silk Road (bad guys to them).
If you made this kind of info public and shined a light on the issue, I don't have a problem with that.
If you sell the API keys for money to big business and government and are very transparent about that - charge the F out of them by the way - and publicly post what they ask for (whole data dump being most expensive) - and make them pay in BITCOIN so the fucking game goes full circle, 
Then I would like your CV thing.
Because it would push bitcoin to full anonymity, which I really want.
But in reality, I wish you'd do a simpler business.
Like could you sell copies of linux tails for bitcoin, or fund Tor exit nodes, VPNs, or other privacy and autonomy enhancing projects or products?
You want to be famous, obviously, why not make a more wanted business?

my theory is that Satoshi died early and took their coins with them -- or even better, is still around, but had their early mined coins disappear, probably lost the keys and didn't realize that their experiment would be so successful, and bailed out out of embarrassment.
Or maybe not 'embarrassment' or anger, but just resigned to the pointlessness of it - with keys lost, they're a non-player in their own game. So they just gotta shrug and move on. They could've been a billionaire, if only they had saved the freaking keys! 
And I would bet that some of the design of the language they built into bitcoin is a bit of a Frankenstein and based on some notional programming ideas they had from something unrelated like cellular automata or something and the concept got a bit out of hand. Bitcoin definitely isn't the simplest protocol that you could come up with for just moving amounts around, like if you ONLY wanted a currency. They clearly wanted it to do more like smart contracts, but the language is bonko, and a bit of over-reach. 
They should have focused on simple signature based things to bring inputs and outputs together, keep the anonymity/fungibility, and let you sign digitial information and make a URL-type reference to it or something, so that the blockchain could have been a better backbone for digital information's timestamping / veracity.
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:27:05
Meh, pretend this part is right:


However, the mining industry is characterised by large economies of scale – these are so large, in fact, that the industry is a natural monopoly, in which it is economically more efficient to have one producer than many. The problem is that these economies of scale are inconsistent with long-run competition. This implies that the bitcoin system is not sustainable and must therefore collapse.
Well, I can imagine that once hash rates level off and we have 10nm ASICs and there's not a ton more gain going central, and hash rate is near the cost of electricity in some way (and I don't have ultra cheap power, but it's pretty cheap, about 8 cents a kilowatt) - well then I can use a bitcoin miner as a space heater, which would be handy this winter. And in summer it's a BBQ outside.
So, I can imagine that I as an individual have some use for the heat a miner makes and that spreads the units back out. 
So I'm not 100% sure that things really do all come together under one control, even if we think there'll ultimately only be a couple big builders of mining equipment (like Intel and AMD are to CPUs).
Seems pretty iffy.

Genuine question -- is there a good "language" or format do you think for this kind of thing?
I read once a certain kind of mathematical(?) analysis of Kerberos and I forget the exact form of it. Is it that kind of mathematical-ish thing that would be good?
*Maybe this was - Dolev–Yao model -  - it's been a while so I don't remember. I liked the idea.
A big part of what concerns me, regarding a different topic, bigger block size, is that I'm not sure that people have gamed out the double-spending game of people spending on bitcoin-1MB and bitcoin-20MB and playing the game of seeing what they can get confirmed on the bitcoin-20MB blocks (95% of the size, so most likely a nearly full block would have your doublespend from bitcoin-1MB in it??) -- 
Well anyway, would love to see the different kinds of attacks and goals, same as you, all laid out. 
I think LN has a chance - especially the simple payment channel, 1 to 1. I almost think that one's a doable slam dunk.

Yeah to you and me, bitcoins are real - they are a currency, they are a store of value (?), they cannot be counterfeited, they can be traded for cash money, and they are money.
To other people, bitcoin is not that, for them.
The closest analogy I can think of for non-enthusiasts would be that this mining of bitcoin is most similar to something like using electrolysis to get silver ions out of a solution --
Or like the Japanese had plans to explore separating uranium out from seawater - it's expensive in terms of electricity, but it is possible... 
And so silver and uranium are real, and using electricity to separate it from a solution or from seawater is maybe a question mark of an activity, but understandable - I mean they "Get it" in that if silver or uranium is scarce enough then it might be rational and economical to "mine" it that way 
... I think where we lose them is where we find (or a larger economy finds - not just you and me) bitcoins to have value - and they look at it as a 'fiat' system - eg this valueless token thing .... it has value .... but only because people believe in it. :)   And they see easy substitutes nearby - like dogecoin or whatever - so they just can't believe that bitcoin is unique. But if they fire up their own bitcoin miner and make a genesis block .... expect no one to join them. So it turns out they can't clone it.  That the raw software itself is not the thing.
But I think they should fire up a bitcoin clone, name it 'buttcoin' and fire up a set of mining rigs and mine their own coin. If they believe in it, and put some effort in, and get the network effect going, it could work.
But here we are! :) This crazy setup works because a mass of people believe it can. Are we delusional, hopeful, visionary, .... spellbound is maybe the best way to put it :)   (Delusional is I know how they would describe it. I think bitcoin and what it can do is cool and interesting.)

Great post --
Can you think of some things that people could do in Venezuela to earn bitcoins digitally?
1) Like music, post let people pay to download
2) Helping us keep up with financial news or numbers and stats?
3) Political news commentary and opinion (translated over to English?)
4) English/Spanish translation or localization services for software?
5) Maybe offering courses or texts digitally online, like YouTube, with a bitcoin address we can tip? Actually anything you can post up on YouTube?
6) Maybe, if oil an gas industry information, like how it works and (it could even just be in Spanish) but captioned in English potentially? And have someone walk through how offshore drilling works, what the processes are, some kind of hard hat walkthrough of an installation? We're all pretty nerdy engineer types and I bet it's pretty interesting.
7) Any opportunities for people to export/import things that Venezuela needs and wants for bitcoin?
Well good luck, I'd love to see more interesting market things happen. Something the government won't want to immediately shut down would be best. Ways to earn that expand their economy would obviously be welcome.

It's a real problem that economies of scale right now are set up to encourage centralizations.
Mining pools are a kind of stop-gap to make it so that people can even out their mining payouts possibly for the cost of a fee to join the pool. 
But it would be interesting to see if there could be something eventually encourage things to be a bit more spread out, either encumber the really large pools into splitting up or not wanting so much of the hashrate.

If a person lends Lawsky the assumption for a moment that they are simply trying to stop scammers from offering fraudulent financial products, it can kind of make sense? \
(Another read, not lending him that assumption, is that his office gets a de facto veto on new financial products so that incumbent banks and other finance groups will have no pesky competition -- I personally don't think that they seem themselves that way, but I think that incumbent banking groups see regulators as "cat's paws" or "useful idiots" to fend off competition with the power of regulation, which is like make-it-up-as-you go laws.  It might not be that bad because there is some public discussion about regulations and it's ... turning out like a person might have expected it to.).
But it's not clear that it's needed if there's laws against fraud already and all the main owners are going to be super well known and public...
As opposed to hiding on the other side of a screen, anonymous, and seeing a lot of incentives to exit scam.

If bitcoin was now newly created, like another altcoin, then yes it would be like a premine.

The 75/25 split doesn't sound so great ://
If they had said: a BitSplit chip effectively uses pooled mining. You can arrange that the split goes to any of 50 addresses (or 25?) giving you 2% (or 4%?) granularity on where the mining payouts go.
Here's how to use it: you set up a device, and have it mine on low-power mode, to jumpstart some satoshis onto the device.
The device itself is a miner and a wallet and somewhat bitcoin aware and able to do basic payments and receive money. 
The beauty of it is a bitcoin-capable device - and if these are ubiquitous enough - no one has to ask anyone for permission to innovate in ANY WAY - just go for it :)
Okay and some problems related to signing transactions ... tbd. etc.
But it's slightly disappointing as a fixed 75/25 split miner. :/

This is a part of the patronizing regulation regarding those who prove that they have disposable wealth. Those with a high net worth are allowed to invest in riskier investments than common plebs. 
See: 
Essentially the SEC allows riskier things to be sold to high net worth individuals figuring caveat emptor. 
On the one hand, this means that scammers have to convince a smaller audience. 
On the other hand, this prevents ordinary people from joining in. 
On the other hand again, this prevents ordinary people from trying to do things like fund Phase 1 pharmaceuticals, which are such a mind boggling longshot they might as well buy lottery tickets .... etc

It sounds like Adept, their blockchain, will put checkpoints out there (to say, bitcoin's blockchain) and hope that that secures it enough.
At least to wherever they put a note out there as a checkpoint. That's an amusing thing to do, IBM could have an address out there on the blockchain and occasionally, say daily, sign a transaction that acts like a checkpoint for their own chain.  The costs of that could be really low, say 0.0001 to 0.0005 bitcoin. Fund the original address with a bitcoin and you're rolling. 
Then if Adept comes under heavy and obvious denial of service attack, then they could go back to a checkpoint. If Adept comes under slow and stealthy attack, there would be nowhere to checkpoint back to that would be reasonable and they'd have to start over.
Just use bitcoin and colored coins from the beginning and save yourselves the trouble guys ;)
Depends on if there's more features here in Adept than it seems.

@_date: 2015-05-28 22:15:56
Right - I agree with you. A lot of payment channels are one-way. Eg, I go to Starbucks and all the payments go out from me and into them. If I was a 'big spender' at Starbucks today, I could escrow 1.0 bitcoin at the beginning of the month, go maybe twice a day to Starbucks or not, skip the weekends etc, and at the end of the month close out the channel with like 0.45 back to my change address, 0.55 bitcoin to Starbucks for the dessert-like coffees, and a small fee to the miners.  
In the LN YouTube video they kicked around the ideas of having different legs of payment channels and things that could be passed around transitively from me, to a merchant, back out to another user, etc. 
I will admit I didn't understand that wrinkle, the one where I the customer, somehow wind up paying a coffee bean supplier in Guatemala, and do it together through Starbucks.  They didn't use that exact example but I'd have to see how they pulled that trick off. I remember it was clever? To me that's the part I also didn't understand and it would make the LN system really amazing. 
Because, as you point out, most payment channels are actually just one way. If they balanced, or were in a triangle trade or something, or some kind of mesh, then they could settle out a lot less.
EG: somehow my employer is adding to a pool of bitcoin, a part of which I have escrowed out to Starbucks, who has escrowed a chunk to buy coffee beans, who somehow is connecting to a pile of utility companies, and other bill paying systems in Guatamale in bitcoin, but somewhere, somehow, this loops back to my employer???  A huge longshot and difficult to get my head around. 
Maybe if there's a simple system for the major Fortune 500 level companies and 10,000+ small companies, 100,000+ small suppliers in China, and that would swoop up so many that then a massive payment mesh, all using escrowed bitcoin in payment channels between them .... that would be "blow my mind" levels of bitcoin adoption.  The one in a million moon shot outcome for bitcoin. 
In my fever dream I can almost see it.
...and I guess the USD $ is already used this way, so it must be possible?
To me it feels like we need one or two good ideas even past LN to get there. ;)

So that means that I can't easily buy a NASDAQ stock like Google (GOOG) or the Winklevoss COIN thing - I think.

That is so insightful -- to imagine a kind of /dev/bitcoin to provide mined satoshis ...

This sounds like an interesting way to have a device do something like .... have a Roku sign up for services,  ... and then the device can have a microwallet, and you can charge it up and pay for services with it? or authorize a device?
b) definitely gets you closer to refrigerators and vending machines that pay for their own resupply ....

Later members pay for earlier member's payouts:
STEPS TO FOLLOW:

2. Update your profile (login to your account and click "Profile")
3. Create your dream (ADD DREAM) by describing it AFTER updating your profile, e.g. "Life changing dream".
4. Choose the amount you will donate to make your dream come true; e.g R2 000.00
5. Choose the amount at which you wish your dream to be fulfilled at; e.g R4 000.00
6. The system will calculate the months you will have to wait for your dream to come true; e.g 3-5 months
7. You will be given banking details of the community member to handle those funds. That member will be a member who deposited more money than yours when creating his/her dream to avoid cheating in the community.
8. Choose South African Rand to be given a community member from South Africa. After making a deposit you will mark it as "sent"
9. The recipient, a community member to receive funds will be notified and will have to as well confirm your payment.
10. If the receiving community member does not confirm payment in 5 days you write on dispute and report a problem and your issue will be resolved.
11. If payment is confirmed your money will appear in your dreams member area in units called Kipi and it will accumulate profits until your dream become fulfilled.
12. After you have an active dream in your back-office, then you can begin to use your invite code to invite friends, colleagues, relatives and anyone to the program and Kipi will reward you with commissions for any referral you make, 5 levels deep. You can withdraw 1st level bonuses from friends anytime when they reach R100.00 or above.

Anyway, I turned out to be way more into bitcoin than him. Half the reason I'm into bitcoin is that I thought it had way more potential than he thought it did.

I still think bitcoin will win. 
Just saying that a lot of altcoins are pump and dump scams because it seems like a lot of authors want to mine themselves 1-10% of the coins and then see if others will join in. 
The get rich quick side of bitcoin isn't really there. But there's always a temptation for someone or a group to make a coin and see if it catches on.
I should clarify: I think it's a big waste of their time to make their own coin (meaning, banks)

kind of getting the point of bitcoin:
"Bitcoin, being truly peer-to-peer, does not require the same management of deciding what nodes to trust and allow onto the network, and expelling them when they turn malicious."
Another centralized approach.
Obviously people are going to push their closed clubby versions. Bleh. It's a trap. Stick to open bitcoin-based things!

Mmmm banks probably do the wires as a normal part of correspondence banking. They might waive the cost for special customers too just as goodwill. I don't think bank wires really cost that much, but there's a bit of brick and mortar overhead.
I think banks make a lot of money by making loans (fractional reserve, not likely to burn them actually, socially insured, audited for the most part), and then repackaging that debt for sale so it's off their books, they have cash back and can lend again.
I think that overall, modern finance is hyper-successful (that's not a good thing, it's too much, they are very powerful)

There is, as you are insightfully realizing, a kind of "conservation of complexity" in the expression and then the realization of an idea, from code to things happening in the computer at a low level.
SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE id = 'foo'; 
Underneath the scene there are many moving parts running around in machine language. Regardless if the interpreted statement has been cooked down to a stored procedure or a precalculated query or in other ways optimized.
There's kind of a base level of complexity that will be expressed regardless, at a low level.

What would be funny is if someone could invent something that both pruned the tiniest fractions of bitcoin (made them available to future miners as fees maybe)
And scrambled things up so much that you had to put a little bit of CPU work into discovering where your coins went based on a seed ... 
And effectively left you looking at a blockchain showing flows all over the place, and values that in sum are correct, but where any given value you can't say is true or not, coming to and from wallet addresses you can no longer connect to anyone.
Would love to see bitcoin find a way...
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:47:45
It's a bad idea. 
If you were selling bitcoin, you know that someone buying using PayPal could reverse the transaction and you would lose your bitcoin and they'd get their money back.
So on the buyer side, a seller that says they take PayPal = DANGER run away!!  There's got to be something really wrong about a seller that's staying in business with PayPal buyers supposedly buying from them.
I would really watch out, don't use PayPal to buy BTC (or sell with PayPal either obviously).

The main reason is privacy - reusing addresses lets people figure out it's you and not some other person using an address. It depends though on the details of how you spend outputs, in the long run.
A second reason is that when you sign a transaction, information in a very disguised way gets revealed. So there is a weakness cryptographically in reusing the address - it's not a huge weakness but it's more than cold storage has or anything where so far the address has only been used once.

People theorize that because bitcoin can be divided right now down to 8 decimal places, that because of that divisibility you won't have a lack of bitcoin to work with,...

I would have imagined that land registries weren't necessarily corrupt, but maybe vulnerable unless people were able to keep copies spread out.

That's the best part there's no third parties.
It's a way of making a transaction with bitcoins in escrow and things are left partially signed, with some timeouts, and if either side wants to they can close the channel, sign whatever transaction they had that had the best balance, and play that to the bitcoin network.
The cool features are that little microtransactions can go off bitcoin, unseen and not clogging up space. It's like a way of having credit with someone without having to give them all the bitcoin at once.
Next, it's great for bitcoin price because hypothetically a future of lightning network connections means that people have to close channels out when they've finished transmitting the value (or want to close the channel). Ultimately, you have to escrow (buy and hold) bitcoin.
And bitcoins that have to be held in escrow (bought), and then bitcoins that are more valuable in larger sizes (settles out less often, if micropayments are the same size, then 10x larger amount escrowed means 10x less fees on the blockchain because you closed 10x less - like paying your cable bill for a year), and if micropayment channels make it easy to buy coffee or stream movie payments or hail cabs then bitcoins are worth more and so is the whole network.
It's win-win-win for holders of bitcoin, users of bitcoin as a currency, people looking for more micro-level privacy -- you would be able to know 'relationships' between addresses and a bit about the kind, but not about every little purchase -- it's great all around.
Dangers and downsides .... are there tricky ways to make things expire in some cascading and failing way? etc!
But it's very exciting and I think it has more promise than sidechains because it doesn't have to go make a new thing. 
Sidechains are doable -- see Namecoin, but the tricks of pegged value and bits sounded tricky.
Also would be interesting, is there a way to make a mesh of transactions with these things, in some specially marked way?  The idea there is that I can have a channel set up with ... Uber, but it would alsoo work with Starbucks and with Spotify and with Netflix ... etc, in a big mesh.  But when things settle out, it might look like it was between me and Uber. But in reality, I also made purchases to all those other things. Then no one but me and Uber would have a freaking clue by looking at the blockchain at what happened. Best part, I can't help investigators sort it out very much, as I only know my own purchases, not what Uber, Starbucks, Spotify, Netflix, etc did.

Bitcoin mining is 'embarrassingly parallel' - the miners can do their mining tasks independently of the others and pretty much hardly ever need to communicate.
Other forms of parallel processing get slowed down by depending on another task/thread/cpu/neighbor/signal/semaphore/lock's results, but not embarrassingly parallel tasks.

The blockchain grows linearly, but Kryder's Law has disk space going super exponentially (faster than Moore's Law).

You know I am not 100% sure what a good API for that would be but I'm assuming something that wraps bitcoin-cli ?
Or maybe makes calls out to blockchain.info ? 
That might be best as two different APIs potentially?
I'm assuming a function like -- 
=bitcoin-cli("getinfo") 
Maybe not needed. Just was curious if being able to go to/from Excel via an API to the bitcoin-cli would be good.
But it'd probably be dangerous so maybe not.
They could always have some kind of VBA that shells out (shudder).
Like this Excel VBA code that shells out: 
Instead of calling Notepad.exe call bitcoin-cli but that's over on a unix box, etc...

The government can tax real estate :) --- Georgism is what it's called.
And they can tax you at entry/exit points, like airports.
Tax collection is no problem. The land can't run away. If it has no owner that's paying the taxes, you don't even have to know who the owner is. You can simply confiscate it and move on.
This sort of thing has a story going back to what happened at Arlington ;)
The tricky parts --
Making it so that there is or isn't an exception for your personal home. 
Making a fair assessment system. My suggestion is for there to be a "make me move" type of number -- if someone puts up a bond showing that they can pay, right now, something like 100x to 200x your annual taxes -- and those annual taxes are a number you are voluntarily paying - could be as low as a dollar (or 0.0001 bitcoin say), then they become the new owner and their first tax bill is double what you paid. So you can "defend" your land ownership by paying higher property taxes. If you think your land is worth it, pay more. If you are poor and can't afford a lot, pay less (but you'll be moved aside for freeways and malls).

But if you want light, heat, and bitcoins, this is a fun triple play.

The blockchain has high availability and integrity built in. It has optional confidentiality. It's globally dispersed and agnostic about how people read it. It's transparent and trusthworthy. It's a good foundation for something like a land registry.

Dash has a nice staking system that drives big purchases - must have 1000 dash to stake - so I think they got some of the economics of their proof of stake system working, but to me it sounded like the math was a mixer and I didn't trust it as much as Monero.

I don't know about the mining rate...
But I think it would have been interesting if bitcoin had done Proof of Work in a different way .... like some way that people who use bitcoin, as transactions, could 'vote' on the mix of technologies that they want to see 'wasted' securing the network. Like instead of SHA256 which went CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, decide that instead of pure SHA-256 dedicated CPU, that they wanted something more interesting ...
Like the SHA256 of a large amount of ram where the transactions are played out into ram into a huge pattern. Or make it require larger storage by having requirements that a transaction have to go back in time to other reference material - eg design it for storage as part of the cost. 
Would be cool if people could almost 'vote' by how they burn their fees or something. Like I do a transaction and then burn with my fee 'want bitcoin network to require more storage' or you might burn .1 bitcoin in fees and attach a note 'require more CPU'

There's a Trezor 'shield' you can lay over a Raspberry Pi, for Trezor developers kit.
It gives you the screen and buttons of a Trezor and I think would work, but you should ask them.
Maybe getting the firmware to be signed and checked and other limitations make it insecure.
I'm not sure, but I bet it would work, enough to actually be a little curious if I could buy a Trezor shield for Raspberry Pi and go to my local Radio Shack and pick up a Raspberry Pi and load up the Trezor firmware to try it.
old news item at SatoshiLabs: 
Would you trust their Trezor shield, their firmware, and your Raspberry Pi? I bet the actual Trezor is pretty cool just as-is.

Well, bitcoin's taught me that emotional trading made on Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is overblown.
For me: 
The part of your brain that screams 'buy! buy! buy!' might as well be ignored. Any time I bought extra coins out of fear that I wouldn't see lower prices, I later saw lower prices. Argh.
And it seems like whenever I try to 'protect' my coins by moving some accumulated coins off to cold storage, that's when I should have been selling.
What a brutal year.. :)

Yeah, thats what a lock would solve? Then he can pay bills later with bitcoin, or not, I assume he then has to trust Coinapult to not go out of business etc.
He could just keep it all in cash on both sides and take the 10% hit as he transfers value, or go in and out like this:  USD -&gt; buy bitcoin -&gt; transfer value -&gt; sell bitcoin for Korean currency
I'm surprised HSBC couldn't give him a bank account on both ends and convert the currency automatically. But then they have to have accounts in almost any possible country that would want to do this and the amount of red tape would get higher ... and higher ... and higher ...

I think a few of them are open minded enough to see a potential new asset class, or an innovation in financial ideas, when they see it.
They probably don't want to believe it's bitcoin that will dominate, so I doubt they'll back it in a big way, but they're probably going to (without having the vocabulary) talk amongst themselves to see if they could build a similar system, "premine" it, keep it amongst themselves and under their control, allow things like a coordinated QE in the system, and make a meta-currency. I can imagine they are drawn to ideas like that. 
Like the politicians that created the Euro or the EU, some clever aristocrat/mogul/politicians are dreaming of how to take separated systems and become Lords over a new system of their own making, something they can control and be unaccountable to others over. Kind of like now.

I am not convinced that there's hugely compelling evidence that the network is growing. Tx might be rising, but I'm not sure if that's wallets not combining their outputs or other weird tricks.

A coder can get to know, somewhat, bitcoin's quirks and use some common libraries or bitcoin itself and work with things.
With altcoins, you might be able to do that for a few more coins, but eventually you're going to have problems keeping up with all the latest security issues in each coin, and the little edge cases you forget are the ones that are going to get your hot wallet(s) looted.
So, way safer to stick with bitcoin and at most 1 or 2 alts that have features you need.
Also, there's a little bit of game theory involved:
Say all other altcoins were basically just bitcoin with very trivial differences (that's not exactly the case but moving on). 
If a crowd of 'dummies' thinks that bitcoin is THE ONE, and you think 'no, that's stupid, let me spread out my risk and reward across bitcoin and 3 to 10 other worthy coins...' .... fast forward a few years. All the dumbdumbs that piled into bitcoin and bitcoin only have made it rocket into first place, far far far beyond the returns in purchasing power of spreading out into multiple coins, and by being big as bitcoin believers, they are like 'I always knew that just bitcoin would win'. And smug as they are, they're right for something like the wrong reasons. They think bitcoin is so great (it is and it isn't) and they've underestimated the network effect and exponential growth and permissionless innovation (the real story).

Maybe, still possible parallel construction... eg, learn about it with secret wiretaps and uncloaking of Tor, but then make up an all new case with a few anonymous tips to the right people, and hand the case off to different agents over time until you've washed the case to an agent who knows _nothing_ about the parallel construction. Then, to them, it's all the Truth.

Well.......... we could move on to SHA-512 or something, but he has a good point. Something to think about crypto is that groups like the NSA employ many mathematicians. They make big advances in secret. And it's reasonable to assume that they want crypto to be strong enough that you and their adversaries can't break it, but they can. They might have found enough end runs around actual cryptography, via side channel attacks, malware, hacked hardware, etc, that for all practical purposes they don't need to defeat the crypto itself. But anyway. /tinfoilhat

And/or a private key to the hot wallet got discarded, reused, or spotted somehow and once you have a copy of it... it's a race condition to see who can get the bitcoins out first.

How should we account for when we gave away or gifted bitcoin - (as a sell?) 
And how should we account for spends - (as a sell? that seems right)
And how should we account for sends out to wallets and back ... (sometimes minus a fraction, where that fraction was a sale - like sending out 5 btc, and a few weeks later coming back with 4.8 btc - used .2 btc to buy something)
And how do we note cold storage when it comes and goes?
So far I like your site, do we have to switch up to the Premium from the Free version to do these things?
I have a lot of exports of btc out to separate cold storage, and then sometimes I buy things, pull it back from cold storage, then put into a wallet, then later buy something with it, then reimport the wallet and split it all back out to cold storage. Maybe buying something once a month or once every couple of weeks...

Ah interesting article.
They don't name names, but how do the different token things like Etherium, Storj, Maidsafe, PayCoin and Hashlets and others fare?
Just quickly I was looking at Storj and it looks like they aren't claiming that Storj tokens give you a part of their company, just that earning storage tokens lets you store stuff and you can buy and sell those for bitcoin and some kind of levelling system keeps those tokens from being a rare thing that you can speculate on - eg they exist just to make the system function, not to make holders rich. Maybe they underwent damage control / revision control. It sure sounded like Storj was in some people's minds the next big thing in tech and worth buying some of their coins speculatively.
What was Etheriums offering? Just a fund of bitcoins for developmers, sold at market rates, meant to fund development, which is proceeding to some version now called 'frontier' - by giving people ethers which .... help run the system, kind of like bitcoins? But not control of the company or group or protocol. I wonder if that will fall afoul of the SEC's view or not, I can't quite keep up.
Or PayCoin / Hashlets (scam?) will fall afoul of the SEC in some way?
Last question:
Does Veritaseum simply track with colored coins the movement of securities offered externally to it? (Eg, a tracking system like a NASDAQ, and can be used to track securities, but isn't necessarily a "market" itself like the NASDAQ?)

Jury nullification seems to depend on the state constitution
The state of Washington, in criminal trials, had information on instructions to jurors and I thought that the part about jury nullification was interesting:
 
And at the bottom has a section on how, in Washington state, juries are not to be notified of jury nullification.
But other state constitutions are noted for allowing it:
"Unlike Washington's constitution, a few state constitutions expressly allow criminal juries to determine the law. See, e.g., Ore. Const. Art. I, § 16; Ga. Const. Art. I, § I, Para. XI; Ind. Const. Art. 1, § 19; Md. Declaration of Rights, Art. 23. Also, some state constitutions allow juries to determine the law in more limited circumstances, such as for libel cases. See, e.g., N.Y. Const. Art. I, § 8; Colo. Const. Art II, § 10; Wisc. Const. Art. I, § 3. Consideration of another state's statutes and judicial opinions on jury nullification must be done with a careful view as to the differing constitutional provisions."

I think that the thing with Lighthouse projects that could be cool is if you think HUGE.
Like -- "I have a drone company, and I want to make a VERY LARGE solar drone that can carry a modest payload around the world. Once it gets to a far away spot, following a route, it will drop a modest payload, say 25 kg, by parachute, within (some circular error probability ~1000m), then it will climb and return to Cleveland. Send your packages to this address, and my drone will deliver it. No longer sit wondering how you can help deliver medical supplies to Liberia. Drop off supplies by air to affected areas."
Relax, and enjoy the fame, you're welcome :)
But you could also do something more modest. Like deliver potato salad by drone in your own area.
Or make one of those 'self-owning' drones people just talk about.
EDIT: and make the structure 3d printable, and let people pay to carry payloads in bitcoin, and what else? Come up with a cool logo like:

ELI5 : what are those? is this a way to pay a miner to mine, kind of outside the fee structure of bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2015-01-28 03:40:07
Right that makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:53:27
 is good
Transactions that move bitcoins around get turned into blocks by miners.
Miners organize valid transactions into blocks and by working hard, get lucky proportional to their effort. Miners get rewarded with the 'coinbase' which creates more bitcoins and gives it to them, and by the fees attached to transactions they mined. Most miners pool their efforts so that the rewards are shared proportional to their effort in the pool, and prefer that steady payout.
The blocks point back in time, to make a blockchain, and the difficulty of undoing an old transaction gets harder and harder as time goes forward.
Users who want to send bitcoins from themselves to someone else just use their wallet software to make up a transaction that does that. They attach a small fee if they want it to be more certain to get mined soon.
EDIT: Bitcoins are not necessarily whole units like dollar bills. They are fractional things, like the numbers you could write on a check. They are very very divisible and you don't have to have a whole one. But you also can't create them out of thin air and write yourself any amount you like. To get them originally you have to mine them. The miners can sell them on or give them away. Bitcoins are effectively uncopyable, unlike other digital objects (like mp3 files), as their origins can all be traced back to when they were created as a reward.

It's more about the kiddos than the bitcoin, for me.

I can only imagine the families and how much they love their kids. Anyway :) big love.

Oh reading this, it sounds like you are more looking for investor types?
Maybe go to     and see if you can get introduced to someone trustworthy from there?
Or maybe someone with Eric Voorhees' level of expertise could help you. Maybe read over his story about SatoshiDice and how he had to sell or get investors.
Or there was also a place in Canada, Just Dice (?) that had some kind of investment system. So you could either be a player of just dice, or run the site, or be an investor in JD and provide essentially the funds for the hot/cold wallet - with the risk that the site operator might run off with your bitcoins, or a sudden shutdown by the authorities gets in the way, etc.
Well, where's it hosted? Hopefully not USA! (and you don't have to say, but you're not a US citizen either right?)  I personally take the view that funding these things with bitcoin is not illegal by US law but I'm no lawyer and it's a grey area. Avoid travel stops in the US by plane ;)

It should go: manslaughter -&gt; hit and run -&gt; parking tickets.

server-side Java is solid and not insane.
client-side Java is a hell hole.
But with bitcoin specifically, it seems like the right thing to do is to run the main bitcoin daemon(s) - some as Satoshi wrote them - in sandboxes, and others like bitcoin core, and heck your own versions. But any differences between what they see is a huge danger sign. And the reference one would be a patched up version of Satoshi's code. And then you have to use some game theory if you see any bugs and imagine all these versions and more are "out there" - what is it that makes it into the blockchain? What are miners building on? What are nodes forwarding? What do clients and wallets see? Most importantly; what's in the blockchain?

@_date: 2015-05-12 23:56:21
A payment channel could be something like a block of bitcoin that I set up in escrow with ... like my phone company. Say I have a pay-as-you-go contract with the phone company. 
Step 1a (on the blockchain): They might make me escrow 0.1 of my bitcoin on the blockchain with the phone company, 2of2 signature to spend it, with a 30 day timeout - after 30 days it all comes back to just me, none to the phone company. This proves I'm "good" for it - I have the bitcoin to pay for the service, potentially.
Step 1b: phone company proposes - buy 600 minutes of phone time, for 0.01 bitcoin? they sign a transaction back to me, expires in 30 days but eliminates the above transaction (like a double spend), I like it(!) I can sign it, it would replace the above, .. I hand that back.
(making phone calls) 
And as I do, my phone is cosigning expiring micro transactions against this escrow of bitcoin, me and the phone company back and forth, quietly signing for phone minutes with an auto top-up system.
End: Eventually, like 30 days later, the phone company plays the transaction out to the blockchain --- 0.1 as input 2of2 signed, sending back 0.4300 to me, and 0.5695 to them, 0.0005 miners fee. 
If I think that's fair, I can sign up for another month, or rather, have my phone do it, automatically.
So what I envision is tons and tons of bitcoin all being escrowed onto the blockchain with multisig, and people paying each other in channels off blockchain, probably in a HUGE mesh - probably something like todays internet of ISPs, all the way down to residential users - 
Anyone that has less bitcoin has to settle out their transactions more frequently, anyone with a LOT of bitcoin can settle up less frequently with less on-blockchain fees, etc.
My vision is that a small company could do a lot with just a little bitcoin and lots of angel relationships, but big companies like BMW will need about 10 bitcoin to escrow buying car parts, selling services, etc. The more they can escrow the more frictionless their transactions.
People like me will basically have the equivalent of free coffee or free cable for life ;) little services which will be so easy to pay for.  That's the fantasy! :)  (Probably NOT getting a private island or a fast car, sigh)
Having bitcoin will be the financial equivalent of having IP addresses on the Internet. You can do more with less, and there will be people who do, but most people will have some, and it won't really cost a fortune, it'll just be normal and very much in the background.
But how many IPs does IBM have? How many bitcoins does Coinbase have? How many IPs does Coinbase have? How many bitcoins does IBM have? It's just another business resource. That's how it'll be.

The fluctuations - are in the 'value' that people are assigning bitcoins when they think about whatever unit of account (like dollars) that they'd like in trade.
Bitcoins themselves are mined at a pretty steady rate, but it does go up and down a small amount, and retargets.
The way the prices go up down and sideways are price discovery and bitcoin has lots of different possible futures 1 year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years from now, with many different outcomes being likely.
Some of the sales are from early adopters who've hit some wealth number and they would like to trade risk with newcomers. They're de-risking their position to have the certainty of some wealth today, and newcomers are taking a bet that holding bitcoin could pay off.
There's a different story per person though.

No one could usually take them without access to the keys.
Which could have been leaked, guessed, found on the street, "hacked", inadvertently communicated, shown by accident on television, discovered using mathematics, poorly generated by the wallet software, etc.
A private key is usually just a very rare and unique number. Can you own a number? Let's say 'yes' because the law is boneheaded sometimes.
It's also somewhat difficult in bitcoin to alert someone that their keys are exposed without alerting bad guys too. Some of the people that quickly grab bitcoin and try to return it, like that German researcher, are clearly doing the equivalent of finding baby stollers on the freeway and getting innocents to safety. So some of the activities may be (illegal? trespassing? circumventing digital rights and encryption schemes?) but with heroic motives. So anyway.

Double emphasize this, they are going to spend millions and millions and millions of dollars before they figure out that they should have used bitcoin's blockchain from the beginning.
The control they're looking for, they might as well use a SQL database for. The participation and trust levels it implies are the business relationships they are used to.
The new low trust, reputation-based relationships are so loaded with unknowns that they won't know where to begin to start monetizing this.
None of that is bitcoin's fault. Bitcoin is perfect for newcomers that don't have the baggage of the old system.

The miners get a public/private keypair that they publish with their blocks. 
Before preset checkpoint times all the miners publish their  new public key into transactions which get mined. Get in too late and you can't mine until the next checkpoint.
Checkpoint times are set in advance and are, assuming &gt; 1 hour from neighboring planets, could be something like once or twice a day.

How exotic do you want to get?
Are you trying to hide the fact that you have a secret, eg steganography  (invisible ink, puzzles, microdots, encoding in a jpeg in a special way, an arrangement of a deck of cards)?
Or are you simply trying to record the seed information another way, encrypted but written down, which will then require some kind of key (like a password) to undo? And on that instruction you can lay out very clearly what it's purpose is, etc, because the only thing missing is a 'password'?
Depending on your paranoia level (I am paranoid), you could use someone else's code or find your own.
The idea would be that you come up with a password and use AES256 or whatever is your favorite algorithm, to encrypt the information. 
You then write down the output to paper and carefully explain what the output is, what it's missing, where to find the algorithm to decrypt it, etc.

I think we should stop worrying about stability so much. Gold's price is not stable and their market is hugely greater than bitcoin's. We have to toughen up and not worry about the pricing power like this and chase fantasy stability.
Unless you need it, like if your business plan is not profitable unless you know the price of bitcoin 6 months out or something - then sure, get a Coinapult set of locks in a basket of currencies or something. Then you're hedging your bets, but you pay a little to get that stability.

So close as an analogy!
Okay, keep your example but with a couple twists:
 
1) most of the accountants are honest
2) some (but not nearly a majority!) of the accountants are dishonest
3) one of the customers is trying to scam the system
Next, the accountants take the transactions they have - and they have to do work.
Let's say at first, they're all pretty close to even in how fast they work. And pretend the proof of work we're looking for is that they have to take all the transactions, and then add 0 to 99 cents on the end in order that they total to a round number. That's a pretty poor amount of work, because although they could find the number blazingly fast, and it's easy to check that it's correct, and you could add to the number digits, it's a poor proof of work because you could solve it as transactions roll in, blazingly fast. What you need is a Trapdoor function. Something hard to make, but easy to verify. Could be finding Mersenne primes, there are lots of examples. But bitcoin chose SHA256. 
Next the difficulty, why it exists, why it adjusts ... the difficulty is there to make sure that the majority of mining power is like a lottery of getting paid off, and it adjusts to keep blocks about 10 minutes apart to account for how quickly we want to settle transactions without undoing work.
Next the block chain, why these blocks point backwards in time, why they are about 10 minutes apart, why being deeper in time makes it less and less likely to be undone ... how this prevents double-spends ...
Double-spends - the perspective that neither spend is right or wrong if you see two of them, but once one of them is mined in a block, and then buried under more and more blocks, then for all intents and purposes, that's the spend that counts.

These banks are no different from other people who came late to the bitcoin party, have clever minds (or can pay for the talent), and who just naturally resent the 'unfair' side of bitcoin (eg not being an early supporter or adopter).  So they will try, and probably fail, or stupendously fail, to make a cryptocurrency that other people want to participate in, but where they laid out the ground rules for their own success and not newcomers.

Does anyone remember a blockchain explorer -- it was like blockchain.info -- but it had a LOT more information about these alternative uses of the blockchain - it could deduce the meaning of various OP_RETURN values and figure out which of these side project type colored coin things were using it.

Less tinfoil hat, parallel construction is when you have some group learn something, by means that would not be legal in court, but where the victim of their surveillance didn't know...
And then you have that group tip off the actual legal authorities by some other means, by some other plausible story, ...
And by that, the police and prosecutors, who may or may not be "in the know" get warrants or other legal search powers without saying how they _really_ found the "guilt" of the accused, possibly by getting warrants by also lying to the judge that granted them one,
All to build up by parallel construction (a plausible alternate "lucky" story), a case for prosecution...

From this - (is he using Windows 7?) - 
So if he copied it into the directory sometime in 2012, offhand (doesn't mean he was using it) - could have made up the details in 2011, cut and pasted it with a copy to another place, edited it later?
A good question for defense's forensic expert.
(And it's not like anything on Windows is actually forensically sound, it's all a garbage house of broken mirrors and lies).
I wonder what happens when you copy from old hard drive to new, or move a file between partitions or hard drives. Could produce some interesting date stamps, but that doesn't mean he was using the information inside the files.
Quoting from article above:
Time/Date Created: When you create a new file or directory, this value is set and does not normally change (unless you deliberately change it). If you make a new copy of a file and save it to a different location, it is treated as a new file and a new creation time stamp is set. Moving a file or simply renaming it does not create a new file, and thus does not give the file a new creation time stamp. (Note: It is possible to end up with a file that has a modification time that's earlier than its creation time when you make a new copy of a file.)
Time/Date Modified: This is also called the Last Written date. Whenever the contents of the file are changed, or files are added to or deleted from a directory, this time stamp changes. Renaming the file doesn’t change the modification time stamp. Neither does opening the file without making any changes to it.
Time/Date Accessed: This is supposed to show the last time the file was accessed, but there is generally a time lag and depending on the nature of the file it may not record it unless a change is made.

There's time after a block is made, where the transactions that got mined have to be accounted for and a new list of unconfirmed transactions have to be readied up to start mining with those transactions in a block.
In the meantime, the miners would have nothing to do, so they get set up to mine an empty block, and sometimes, the only thing they mine is the transaction (the coinbase) which gives them a reward.
They probably meant to mine some transactions but weren't ready when they got lucky.

Inside of bitcoin itself, there is some limit like 15 keys or something.
Outside of bitcoin you can split keys up as many ways as you want, see Shamir's Secret Sharing System (SSSS) 
Don't use your actual bitcoin keys at their demo page but just to try it out.
EDIT:  Oh! I see you want some of the keys to be incompatible(!) 
That's an interesting side wrinkle. 
You could maybe do it by thinking up a good Venn diagram for it, using SSSS to keep the sets apart, and have them use their keys to get to other keys, which in the end, ultimately, does the unlock you want.
So that, from like that pages' example. No one in set 4 gets a key (almost everyone on Earth would be in set 4). Two keys from someone in set 1 and/or 2 can do one unlock (Red envelope). And two other keys from set 2 and/or 3 could do another unlock (Blue envelope). And someone in set 2 could have a red and a blue envelope - but the contents of those have to be kept deliberately incompatible. Once unlocked, the contents of the Red and Blue envelopes could ultimately be the same. The point is that someone in set 1 and someone in set 3 Especially could not collude to make a working decryption with each secret that they know.
So yes, doable, need some set theory (Venn Diagram to keep it straight) and SSSS, and with that, in the end, you could wind up with whatever you wanted to keep secret til the last step, either a bitcoin private key or a set of multisig private keys....
I don't think that this is a case that bitcoin itself does directly with it's multisig, but maybe there'd be some weird pay to script hash that could in a series of steps do the weird and wild unlock you're looking for(!)

The words matter. If you pick 12 words, 24 words, whatever, be sure to keep the original word list -- and of course don't make any special marks on the words you picked! The concept is that you can save the original word list in case whatever software you used that used that list dies off and someone will be able to help you. (Worst case scenario)
Unfortunately, you can not take it for granted that all programmers _will_ use the same word list.
Pardon me for not remembering the thread, but people have been bitten (confused) for writing down their 12 words and then trying to import their wallet into a tool that was using a different damn word list. 
So never never take it for granted that people will work together on this. They SHOULD, but there'll always be someone that customizes a word list.
Example - they might translate a bunch of English words into Japanese and use that word list that they just made up. No one's going to stop them, things are open source, people are creative, etc etc. You can't exactly blame them, not everyone uses English, people come up with a common idea and implement around the same time, etc.

Someone did notice that the way Satoshi made it so that leading zeroes, like playing a game of limbo where you have to get low numbers, and the way SHA256 worked, meant that he really should have waited for the end of the rounds before figuring out if the first few digits are even going to be zeros. He would or should have had the zeros at the end, not the beginning. But whatever, I don't think a speedup there could be better than something (off the top of my head) than like 4%.

Governments are really unlikely to do something that cool, like make bearer bonds out of these, and ignore or not care who owns the land.
If they were open-minded about things, they could - then they could just make bearer bonds out of these tokens, recognize possession as the only ownership that matters, etc, but they're really really unlikely to try to create situations where they can't use the courts to affirm their power.

Painting a dime red and having that mean you are allowed to speak at the next meeting - is a pretty good analogy for colored coins using bitcoin.
Tiny slivers of bitcoin, depending on how they do it, could represent lots of 100 shares. If they want to waste as little as possible they'll use probably 0.0001 bitcoin to hold that, and 0.0001 bitcoin to move it around (fees). 
But they could choose to be more efficient, and write a checksum out to the blockchain, like hourly or daily. Basically get to use the blockchain like a public notary and pay pennies a day for it - and then publish online some Excel spreadsheets with hashes that match the blockchain on that date/time (with a "see for yourself" kind of link out to some neutral blockchain explorer) 
EDIT: I really hope they're going to use colored coins to represent the movement of round lots of shares :)
I hope they have a good design and some good success.

Sure, do you see it evolving like the RFCs for STARTTLS?
(Is there already a way to get bitcoins in smtp ... ?)
I wonder if you could implement this like some of the other mail extensions, something like MIME or the various mail receipt codes.
Ideas from the footnotes at the bottom of the SMTP rfc: 
Maybe scour bitcointalk.org and see if someone has prototyped something workable?
I'm imagining that you extend one of the reasons why mail is deferred with a send again later code (greylisting), and include how many bits to get the mail through (and an address URI to send it to? BIP 21 seems to have an example)




maybe that kind of URI would be implying -- resend your message with some bitcoin - to that URI, and I'll let it in.
Then to see if there's bitcoin in it. Maybe a transaction mined to the blockchain could be proof enough? Send it as a MIME attachment? (Not sure).
And then maybe

Oops I deleted my comment. I think altcoins are neat!
(I think my comment was about making Lightning Networks pay out to Stealth Addresses, with change coming back to my stealth change address or forwarded on to another person with another stealth address...)
But I see what you mean, the LEGO-like mixing and matching of creative ideas, and weirdly even some of the bonko limitations of bitcoin (10 minute confirmation time? Feathercoin was created just to deal with that I think), well those bonko limitations spur people to think hard and sometimes they unleash something new.
And really what's the chance of a Dark Wallet / Lightning Network mashup? :) but it's fun to imagine.
EDIT: small altcoins can do what they want. They don't have to bicker and argue about this and that. They can just do (and take the consequences and/or reap the benefits). There's nothing bitcoin can do that an altcoin can't -- just jumpstart the network effect, and somehow get a fair distribution going, etc. Those are kind of hard to do (network effect, fair distribution) so naturally they have a hard time. But the future is never set in stone and an altcoin today could always be the big winner tommorrow

[B]ecause the court members are not only just reviewing the factual sufficiency of the government’s case when they make a finding of guilty or not guilty, they are also reviewing the wisdom and discretion of –- in the civilian world, the prosecutor -- in this world, the accuser, of bringing the charges, the wisdom of the convening authority in referring the charges to trial.

FileVault does make encryption pretty easy on a Mac. If, when you put on a tinfoil hat, you are worried about the risk of Apple or Law Enforcement decrypting your hard drive ... well okay. 
Say you wanted a different system, one that let you decrypt at some point, .... couldn't or wouldn't Apple put code into something like Bonjour or iTunes to help law enforcement read the state of hard drive and memory (or if not directly help law enforcement or the NSA, at least leave enough bugs that those groups can easily take over your machine)...
I guess what I'm saying is - use FileVault on your Mac. If you trust the rest of your Mac OS, you might as well trust its encryption system.
Switch to a different OS entirely if you need more security. You may need more customized hardware. 
Maybe use something like a Trezor to secure your bitcoins.

It's not the mining that people usually do -- it's the idea that you can jumpstart a miner/wallet with just a few satoshis to get going; it must join a pool or something. This means the devices are not "money makers" for the bitcoin, eg, they are not selling bitcoin miners as money making machines that directly.
But the idea that maybe with a wallet and a few satoshis, a miner can jumpstart it's way into a bigger ecosystem of computers and rent and buy power, or rent out it's own capacity in disk, bandwidth, ram etc, in exchange for bitcoin, so that it has something it can trade and something of "intrinsic"(???) and universal value (bitcoin) that it can start to trade back and forth with others.

Oh I see your point, sorry I missed it.
Maybe on something important like replacing the jackscrew on a 737 tail, you would sign the part number; or take a collection of photos, or a videotape of the maintenance, and scan in all the parts, and then hash that, and sign and put that work into a blockchain.
You could basically prove then that your ground maintenance team had truly done the maintenance, and there'd be full matching video of them doing the work and you could see them barcoding in new parts etc, maybe they'd also be scanning in the instructions they followed to do the work. That'd be kind of neat.
Then when planes crash you can say for sure the maintenance was done correctly, this was the procedure, here's the evidence, here's the parts. Put blame where it belongs etc.

But, online is there a web cgi where I can roll my own transactions interactively and then play them into the network?
I want to be able to generate two addresses. One I can put bitcoin into, and one to use as change I guess if I need it.
Then I want to be able to pick some drop drown boxes for the kind of transaction, the bits and pieces like where I'd like to send it, and the suggested fee (which I can override) and then hit send.
Does this exist? If not ... hmm

Well, one part of that was that apparently they all knew about the malware a long time ago, but didn't tell anyone else. 
Some said that they didn't want to thrwart NSA/GCHQ programs. Interesting.
Apparently some of them submitted samples to Virustotal, but hadn't really put things into their products to detect and block this malware.
So this is a little bit of an interesting problem, like where the antivirus companies need a way to disclose a secret, without the NSA being able to go on a huge witch hunt (which they would) and figure out truly which group found and leaked information - what this malware is, what it does, etc. 
How to disclose a secret - Ring signatures.
Or .... maybe Wikileaks
Or .... they are actually politically in agreement with NSA/GCHQ and tacitly approve of whatever it is they did to Belgacom (and or other unknown victims, but there's always someone everyone can hate together and is on the sanctions list)

Agreed -
If you have to get security by having a private blockchain where, for example, you have specialized (or not) mining gear in a super secret subnet walled garden, then you aren't actually getting the security you're thinking you're getting. 
You're getting a distributed database but it will blow up if anyone tries to impersonate other people and tip the balance in their favor and anyone who joins in, except to learn more about the tech, but anyone who jumps in with both feet into a system like that, thinking it's the next interbank clearinghouse is going to get burned by scammers and hackers.
Private blockchains are just a kiddie pool and it's debateable if they can learn to swim in them because the situation is so idealized.

Mmm I think you have to play to the network two transactions - one is committed to the bitcoin network and escrows the coins, the next one comes later and closes the channel, splitting the original escrowed amount back out to both parties in a way either signed as fair.
So I think it sets up full reserve! In theory it could be a kind of warm storage - because escrowed coin cant be spent - its reserved reserved for the channel
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:11:15
It depends on the level of trust involved. I can agree that there's some number ... probably north of a couple hundred companies, or perhaps jurisdictions, once you get above some quantity of different countries which are underneath all of these companies (20+ ? ) where suddenly, culturally, you really politically cannot be all trusting of each other.
I'll be real and say that the NASDAQ is below that critical number. Because at 70 participants in the NASDAQ: you have some identities, you have people you can put in cages and fine them with judgments, etc, so you can expect contract law to basically work. Definitely at some level of high trust, high identity, good contract enforcement, not too many international actors in the way, you can get by with a SQL database.
But at some other much higher number of participants, you have some you know well, a constellation of others you somewhat have a feeling for their reputation, and then at the fringes a huge number of shadow actors, some of whom are honest/dishonest/shady, or just by various political groups excluded but participating barely. 
In those lower trust, low identity proofing, no-take-backsies environment where you might try to settle in cash on the barrel and promises are worth very little, but maybe reputation can be worth something, but in an anarchistic anything goes way, I think bitcoin will be king, the same way the Internet kind of reflects the international reality of communications and the value of being a part of the biggest network.

You've expressed this well, now I'm wondering if Mike Hearn had a good point about how badly exhaustion of block space is actually handled by clients... they would struggle, resend their transactions which aren't getting mined, maybe add another bit of fee to try and help, run the nodes out of memory, crash them again, delay delay, and waiting weeks for an elastic block size maybe doesn't help...
On the other hand, maxxing out the block sizes helps you predictably plan for storage, 
The fees are helping to stop the dust spam ....
I wonder if some altcoin has solved this problem...
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:11:35
Mmmm, counterargument --
If you have coal (I'm not a fan of coal) or something like that that has base load, you can probably sell coal power for cheap in the middle of the night when no one else is using it.
You may not know that your customers are bitcoin mining in the middle of the night. You just know that someone is buying your cheap electricity.
I think that people outside of bitcoin generally think the electricity use of bitcoin is a major negative.
I think most of them, if they do things like run coal plants that need a base load overnight, would rather do something to store the energy, such as with batteries, counterweights, or pumping water uphill to a reservoir to flow back through a dam when needed - eg some way to store the energy.
Someone who's into bitcoin might not see things as they are as a problem. 
It would be someone who is deeply into bitcoin that sees bitcoin mining, like a battery, or a reservoir full of water, as the storage thing itself. That bitcoins figuratively represent stored electricity, and they literally are "Proof of Work".
Outside of that, there's this whole larger question about whether or not you can have Proof of Work without consuming resources outside the system - I think you have to consume resources. Proof of Work depends on this external consumption of something scarce, or else if it wasn't scarce, it's some kind of trust model.

Something that's interesting is that I've heard that Conspiracy, even the in the scenario you've outlined, while despicable is not necessarily illegal under different legal systems (like France)
They literally don't recognize "Conspiracy" as a crime - they treat it like people talking about stuff, and prosecuting it is equivalent to prosecuting ThoughtCrime.
(Not that I agree! I grew up in a different legal system where conspiracy is seen as a crime itself)
I think it's a bit of a controversy in France because their bank BNP Paribas admitted to Conspriacy over some financial issues and that's not seen as a crime in France and they feel like New York is looting their country with made up rules (paid for by French taxpayers ultimately).

I had never heard of an accumulator before either!
So I have this tidbit from Wikipedia and I think it summarizes it okay:
 A cryptographic accumulator is a one way membership function. It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set. One example is how large composite numbers accumulate their prime factors, as it's currently impractical to factor a composite number, but relatively easy to divide a specific prime into another number to see if it is one of the factors and/or to factor it out. New members may be added or subtracted to the set of factors simply by multiplying or factoring out the number respectively. More practical accumulators use a quasi-commutative hash function where the size (number of bits) of the accumulator does not grow with the number of members.
The concept was introduced by J. Benaloh and M. de Mare in 1993[1] 
So I think how we would use it here is I give you a utxo and I say "I want to spend this" - you need to check if it's been spent already, so you check that utxo in your accumulator function/database/Merkle tree and it says "true" (its found, it's valid, it's not already spent) - so then you let me spend it. A scammer shows up with some utxo's that are already spent (mined) and says "I want to spend these" - and you take their utxo's check them and it says "false" - already spent, not valid.
Kind of cool. How does it do this. Hmm somehow it builds up a tree of these utxos and when I am validating one, I think I either only check the root level or down the tree along the way to that utxo, OR, when I subtract one, somehow I just don't have to recalculate the accumulator for all the utxo's just the path from the root to that one. So I think it's considered really efficient. 
I wish I had a simple obvious accumulator available. As a demo :/  The prime number example above is kind of an interesting one.  It would take me a long time to factor a number, but it's pretty quick to tell if a specific prime number is one of those factors. But that's just an analogy. Sorry I don't know the math crypto on how this works or how come it's so small.
Yes also bridge nodes, not sure if they would help or hurt decentralization. They might be easy to run, it's just a full node plus an accumulator.
Maybe someday you could have a very private version of bitcoin that updates accumulators everywhere but no one sees the base blocks. That is ... probably not possible but I wonder what's possible anymore. Mathematics is amazing.

It's an arbitrary milestone when the commonly traded and quoted amount for dissimilar things hit a crossover point, 
But just like when 1 bitcoin could be bought for $1 US dollar, it's an anchoring point
And more importantly, from that point, you can compare percentage gains and losses, relatively.
Then say you're watching CNBC and you have about $10k USD in "mad money" kicking around to throw at one or the other, in a "get rich or die trying" mentality, and then 5 years down the road when hindsight is 20/20 ---
Will it be bitcoin that grows something like 130 times to match a similar amount of gold in value? (maybe not, but will it double in price?)
Or will gold, which is paper-traded, and maybe controlled by all the speculation long and short, will gold get unleashed and rocket past bitcoin?
Which one would be the better investment, if your unit of account is dollars?
It's all kind of meaningless if you're in a more extreme supporter of one or the other, where either 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, or an oz of gold is an oz of gold regardless of what the fiat money system does.

Those are always interesting people.
I remember when I was in college I wanted to check out Wolfram's Mathematica software but the Maths department didnt have it.
I inquired to find a Maths professor that might be interested in it, if I could find a copy, but they were not interested and further, when I talked about it and explained that the company had a claim that it could do Calculus problems symbolically, they poshed that and insisted that it only figuratively sovled it and that deep down computers are only 1s and 0s and certainly could not be solving symbolically, but instead did computerized approximations...
Um, he was quite wrong in how Mathematica worked.
examples : 
It does solve symbolically, AND deep down is still based on 1s and 0s.
But anyway, a lot of Maths profs are tossers. This guy only knows a few true things, like that that specific problem is proven unsolvable, and misses out on the general case.
In this case, in bitcoin, the problem is not "solved" because there is a vanishingly tiny chance that the blockchain could be undone and re-orged by some fantasically low probability (that decreases with time, etc). But for all practical purposes, bitcoin does actually work.
@_date: 2019-03-29 22:57:44
I wildly agree with you and I think that notional bitcoin values around $1m are easy to reach. If banks were allowed to track bitcoin balances side by side with USD balances, but with the caveat that they couldn't lend bitcoin that doesn't belong to them, but could hold it with insurance in multisig custody as collateral or something, so that it was as good as dollars in terms of contracts and usability and other social factors (that don't matter to ME but do matter to other people in terms of legitimacy), then yeah you would easily see $1m bitcoin. Maybe higher lol.
EDIT: in my fantasy land, $1m bitcoin is like having it so that car dealers need to have \~1 bitcoin on hand in something like Lightning Network, somewhat like having cash in the till. Things like that, where you effectively have to stake a proof of work coin, though it increases the velocity of money, it really adds to the store of value proposition too. Since the money winds up "backed" by the power of your economy in it. Really interesting times ahead.

Did you understand Peter Todd's replace-by-fee pretty well? You sound like a fan, can you explain it better? I felt like he meant well, but I wasn't catching how it stopped double spends or discouraged it. My first feelings was that we should not allow replace-by-anything, because it incentivizes bad behavior, and 
Maybe instead we should have 'double spends make block rewards invalid' - eg, a proof that an earlier attempt to spend was signed with a date/time - not to get a block reward, but a cheap guard against double spends, ... a way where if someone says 'here's a block' and you can show that they had previously already accepted inputs that were doublespending - or that others had sent them - and they acknowledge receiving the prior transaction - like a kind of 'certified mail' style of relay - that the relay sent it, you acknowledge it as a miner to the whole network, and NOW you get to include that transaction and mine it, and miners that don't do that and allow double spends get to have their block ignored.... that's probably abuseable as hell, but also the kind of approach I'd rather see - but I might have the Game Theory of it upside down and backwards.

Eh, if you wanted to buy bitcoin, you could do it over the counter and talk to Barry Silbert, or talk to Kraken, I bet actually a lot of the exchanges could do their AML/KYC and handle large sums.

Scammers abound, bitcoin is not something with taken backs. If they wire your account money, and you send them bitcoin, your money is gone, they will get the euros back too and you will be sad.

How that works is its a tower on the ground people live in, and you need bitcoin to enter. There are no ground level entrances.

Stocks are weird, they are overbought in the sense that some indictators (RSI?) is up to like 30, which I think is double where it should be. Like 10 would be a good deal, 15 is somehow average ish, but 30 is kind of high (overbought).
But, this might be a case of a lot of money having nowhere to go. Low interest rates are forcing everyone into very risky stocks.

It's in logarithmic scale. Log scale is actually really common in real life, you just might not have noticed before.
The Richter scale for earthquakes, decibels for sound, doses of medicine vs the response in the body (doubling the dose does not double the response - 10x the dose might double it, 100x the dose might triple it, 1000x the dose kills the patient..)
@_date: 2019-03-27 20:39:35
$10k was a high number but possible.
Right now, $40k is a high number but possible.
That's about the scale of it.
But when it comes to prices I think it's important to remember that with bitcoin, the market price is like a thorn. The way thorns jut way out from a rose stem. The tip of the thorn is that highest price, then it can fall way back down. Log scale all looks fine, percentage increases and decreases, with a new higher low price after each spike and drop. But what it's like to experience that is hard to explain. One month you can almost imagine saving bitcoin, seeing it double again, and paying off car/credit/downpayment on home. Next month it's cat food. Lol. SO don't get too wrapped up in price. You are most likely to buy and sell at the worst times. Also you are not likely to buy or sell at really good times to do that either.
My advice about bitcoin - accumulating and letting go. Younger than 50? or not retired? Accumulate over 6 months until you have 1, 5 or 10% of net worth into bitcoin. Older than 50? retired? Sell 1 or 2% of your bitcoin spread out over the year. Ignore the price, it's not worth thinking about :/ It's hard to ignore, I give you that.

I am so conflicted about how to answer you.
To keep it short, there are many ways to generate power and charge a phone, but google up if you aren't so sure it's this easy.
* car alternator powered by a bicycle, charges car battery, phones recharge off battery
* turn a handle in the chuck of a cordless drill, cordless drill has leads out to a USB cable. Turn the handle the other way if it doesn't give your phone a charge (since +/- matters)
* any motor in your house - imagine an electrical appliance that turns something, like a washing machine, dishwasher, etc, has an electrical motor. You can turn those somehow with pedal power, your hands, running water, wind, a falling weight (gravity) on some gears, steam blows past a little windmill, and you have electrical power.
I will only concede what I think is your bigger point, which is that very very few people seem to understand electricity and they are pretty helpless if the mains go out.
And that just because they could do something in an emergency, it's no way to live and it would be way way better if their government become functional and that their economy got going in an uncorrupt, non-violent, stable money, working electricity, stable prices, full grocery store shelves, help the poor, not a crazy pariah kind of way. Thanks.
I'm just saying that I know how to generate electrical power with an electric motor, some wires and a battery but I can see how hmm other people might not realize it's easy. You also need some input source of "energy" (in a physics sense) to do work to turn the shaft of the electric motor. That could be lots of different inputs.
And electric motors are not the only way to generate electricity! Ie, solar panels, including horribly inefficient scrap copper plate based solar panels or recycling LED or OLED screens to make them into a solar panel.
And how did Ben Franklin make electricity, wool and amber? I mean electric fields are a fundamental property of our Universe. (Just read up, it was a glass globe rubbing against a rubber pad. Turned by belt and pulley system).  So thinking creatively, maybe a wine bottle turning against a leather jacket would work. Maybe it would not work. Would have to try it.
Also, I get it, I'm not going to MacGuyver up a system unless I didn't have electricity for about a week. Hope springs eternal, and I'm not differnet than 1000 other people who would also just wait for the power to come back on.
One last detail I thought I would mention. For a cell phone polarity is going to matter. So if you are turning the crank of a motor, and it's not charging, and you check and the wires all look right, try turning the motor the other way, or mounting it the other way around. Or swap the wires. See if that helps. Or press the reverse button on the drill that might work. Once you get it figured out you just leave it. Tape it up.

Right but it's just for cell phones :)
I don't know, I mean I read on some other notes that the cell towers were down, others that they were down for a little while then back up ...
And at home I have a solar charger for my cell phone with my hiking stuff, so I just don't know anymore what people know how to do.
I'd recommend that one book - The Boy who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba. He also did a moving TED talk
What he did was he was a kid, and he took a bicycle that you could pedal and it had a front headlight that was powered by contact with the wheels. So you had to pedal to get a light, a pretty common device for bikes. Good if you don't have batteries. 
He took that idea and instead of the light, he used the +/- leads to power a truck battery.
I've got the details wrong, since I remember he stripped the bike down til it was a frame and a crank and this thing that could charge truck batteries. 
Then he took some PVC pipes and split them open lengthwise and melted/softened them in an open fire, so that he could press them flatter and turned them into lightweight wind turbine blades. Like for a windmill.
He attached that to the crankshaft of his bike frame.
Then he hoisted the bike about 10+ meters into the air, and extended the leads down so they were probably about 15 meters long, to his bank of truck batteries. Then the windmill he made out of a bicycle gave his family - lights at night, income from charging people's cell phones off the truck batteries etc.
His story is very inspiring. I want people to konw that things like what he did, although they are extreme, and although we might all think that the best thing in life is to wait for governments to get their act together and provision the basics like electrical power - in some places you may be waiting a long time before anyone comes and does anything.
This comments not aimed at you, just anyone that wanders through this thread and wonders what I'm on about.
Also my best friends Dad, when I was a kid, he was an Electronics Engineer and his sons took apart all their toys and we really played a lot with electronics and none of them would be phased for a second by some lame power outage. Potential sources of energy are all around us to power electronics, especially low voltage stuff like a 5V cell phone etc.
Okay, also, just in case anyone reads this thread a year later and wants to see another practical way to generate electrical power if you're desperate and you need to charge a cell phone: if you have a cordless drill and a few parts, you can set up your drill so that turning the shaft of the drill powers your phone. In this setup, its a drill, yarn, an egg beater attachment, a wooden spoon and a piece of wood. It took them 3 hours (ugh) to charge a phone to 100%. I am just saying, if you are DESPERATE, you can charge your phone. And it could save your life and get you rescued etc.
If you rig up the spinning side to a bicycle and pedal in place or find a more creative way to rig this up, you might only need to pedal for 10 minutes to get enough charge to make an emergency call or just stay online so your cell phone sends a signal that you're out there for search and rescue to find you by triangulating between cell towers.

The cell phone towers were up
And people could charge their phone off their cars via the cigarette lighter to USB charger, so they could keep their phone charged.
So ... yes a physical dollar bill would be easier, so would gold or silver coins, or cans of mackerel, but other fiat money in their area like their government's money was worthless.

If bitcoin is fungible, then like that Scottish guy that wrote "I own this" on bank notes, which later got stolen, like the court decided, they weren't his anymore. Wild, but true. 
So who's to say. Even a court might decide that stolen bitcoin, if a bank accepts them, are the banks that received them, not some original owner. Weird how human laws work.

Well you know, I mean right now euros aren't totally worthless, so if someone offered me a really large amount of euros for bitcoins, I might consider it. But then I'd probably just turn around and buy more bitcoin.
They could keep buying bitcoin until they run out of euros. They never run out so bitcoin prices in euros would go stratospheric, since bitcoins are actually finite (very divisible though)

It's one reason to look into the future and imagine the plausibility.
Whenever I think about the future, especially with things like future investment values etc, I remember a couple of key quotes ...
1)  "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop" - Herbert Stein
2) In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period, just a million years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.
- Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi
3) xkcd: extrapolating - 
I still think $100k or $1m bitcoin could happen, but the circumstances would be really interesting. Like 1% chance it happens. Either hyperinflation of the dollar, some weird total capitulation by banks, or some weird sudden ah-ha moment from the public, etc.
Shorter term extrapolation doesn't seem unreasonable. I don't know why, but I like to imagine my retirement in stock accounts actually going up in value. Or the speculative value on my house (actually the real estate under it, not the house - the house is a depreciating asset, but the land I speculate will go up in value since I'm in a major city and big cities everywhere are getting huge boosts for some reason) etc. So we speculate on future value all the time.
EDIT: I can't stop myself. 
If you see bitcoin as a kind of "Libertarian retirement fund" it's funnier and more enjoyable than endlessly worrying if bitcoin is money and if these prices are plausible. They are completely hilariously plausible and there is hardly anything nocoiners can do about it.

How I used to see the world:
1) at 20: brains and talent is key. with those things, the world is your oyster. Also helps to be young so you have time to achieve things
2) by 30: it takes money to get things going and places like Harvard are divided into the rich and the smart. One group, the smart, are trying to get funding from the kids of the rich, and Harvard exists to help them network
3) by 45+, post bitcoin: don't forget those that try to sell a dream. They can be liars and cons, or they can be visionaries. They are another way to succeed. You can have brains, capital, or the ability to sell a dream. Also, I read Ken Fisher's book 10 roads to riches and I've come to realize that there are a lot of ways forward in life, if money is what you want.
These cons work because people had hopes that medical testing could be a lot less onerous. People believed in it because they wanted it to be true. They were scammed, they didn't deserve to be scammed. It's hard to do enough due diligence in this world. People who aided and abetted scammers are still guilty of something.

Crypto is fiat in the sense that it's made up numbers, but it's not fiat in the sense that governments force you to use it.
Its easier to send bitcoin than gold
It's harder to spend because of lack of recognition and familiarity than dollars.
But lots of things are used as money and have been. What people use as money is kind of local to their time and place. It can shift around every hundred years or so (exception gold and silver which in the past few centuries mostly conquered other kinds of money like wampum, cattle, glass beads, etc)
Anyway, now that you have the Internet, it's a good idea to make a money that is more native to the Internet. The problem with most digital things is that they're not really scarce. Like you can copy mp3 files, and you can make a set of databases to track wow gold, but I think for a long time people didn't believe that you could actually make a decentralized digital money. Now bitcoin was first, with proof of work, and time will tell if first mover is most important, or if people are going to use proof of stake, or strange things like tokens built on something else, or layers like lightning, or what's going to happen. 
But in general, with the Internet and people wanting to make payments and some the natural human desire to be free of controls, in this case by banks and governments etc, and to cross boundaries and be free, I think you're always going to have cryptocurrencies. Also, you can't uninvent them. So I think though bitcoin might be the one, it's also possible that something that doesn't require the resources of mining (electricity) like a proof of stake coin might work out.
Hard to tell. I mean obviously you don't accept these as money. But it's also a network effect, where if more and more people do take cryptos as money, then they just are money. 
Same as like other past forms of money.

The cell phone towers were up, and they could still charge their phone from their car via the cigarette lighter. So a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency wallet would be fine.
Their own local money has collapsed in value.
They could also use gold or silver coins, or find some other standard portable trade good with the features that can turn it into money (like in prisons - cigarettes, mackerel cans, etc)
Yes obviously if the government ran their economy correctly, they wouldn't have hyperinflation and their money would be fine, like the Swiss franc.

Yeah [lopp.net]( is great.
I like the 26 minute video about bitcoin that is a bit more tech.
The only thing about that video that I think needs an asterisk is that bitcoin transactions are little programs.
Something even I didn't realize for a long time, because the whitepaper never mentions OP\_ codes. (You can search the whitepaper for "OP" "code" "stack" "Forth" etc, it's not there).
So deep down I assumed for years that bitcoin was a much simpler system than it actually is.
Apparently there was even code in bitcoin for a P2P marketplace to buy and sell things too and have listings for vendors, but I think that is all excised out of the code now. (That stuff does belong in another layer...)
That programmability is what makes bitcoin programmable money.

The BitLicense suck and is dumb. What businesses did is they either decided to play in NY and stay, or they stopped serving customers there.
It does seem like this case has some merit because the defendants apparently wanted to apply for the BitLicense, but whatever evaluates companies compliance delayed on determining whether or not this company complied. The lack of compliance then got them into some hot water, as an aside to other charges or something.
So basically the BitLicense from the powers that be perspective is working great, because here's two small fish to fry as a warning to others.
The businesses that either had the legal teams and money to comply and wanted NY customers did and stayed, the others who say no way bailed, and the maybe unlucky / partly unwise, stayed and are now being tried on this and got this mixed up with other things that they might be guilty of.
Plus, it looks like the legal system tried these two people separately so that they have a hard time coordinating their defense? Something like that.
I don't know if that's the case, maybe I have some wires crossed with another case.
I do wish you luck, I wish the BitLicense didn't exist. It seems like a dumb idea. Clearly they were listening to Professor BitCorn and the damage is done.

It's not too far off though, it's like if banks become strong and scale back the level of fractional reserve, they could be pretty stable etc, and it weakens (not completely) the argument for the need for bitcoin.
His home country, Lebanon apparently has a strong central bank with fairly sound money (a lot of gold in reserve, something like 20% backed? more than most banks I think).
 So it goes to show that a decent banking system is not enough, there is more that a country has to have before they can really be strong.

Strange for this to come up in this thread, but it occurs to me that this kettle logic is like Ross Ulbricht's defense -- from the wiki page on alternative pleading:
At a late 1970s American Bar Association seminar in New York,[1] Richard "Racehorse" Haynes gave this example: "Say you sue me because you say my dog bit you. Well, now this is my defense: My dog doesn't bite. And second, in the alternative, my dog was tied up that night. And third, I don't believe you really got bit. And fourth, I don't have a dog." Normally such arguments would seem to cancel each other on their face, however, legally "even if" and "anyway" clauses need not be argued; mutually exclusive defenses can be advanced without excuses for their relationship to each other. Of course jurists might be influenced by dual defenses such as "my dog was tied up" and "I don't have a dog", but this must be weighed against the fact that defenses may not be allowed if they are introduced too late.

That's not how BU would be erased, it would be erased by users that have a lot of old bitcoin, making up transactions to get them into BU blocks and then doublespending the inputs and trying to get those mined into classic blocks.

"When you cut away the echo chamber of these nonsense numbers, it should be an efficient, well-arbitraged market."
The first thing the don't realize is that it's not bitcoins and dollars trading there. It's IOU bitcoins and IOU dollars, worth actually a different amount per exchange.
Well, I think an outsider to bitcoin would assume that all true bitcoins are the same everywhere.
But what is traded on these markets and the reasons for the differences in the price isn't just wash trading and fake volume (though that is certainly happening).
There is also painting the tape. Hidden orders. Secret internal access to the order books. Front running the clients on behalf of the exchange itself or high paying whales.
And the ever present risk of getting hacked, margin called, exit scammed, selectively scammed, etc etc etc!
Bitcoin is amazing powerful and awesome. But bitcoin markets are plagued by problems. Mostly because this is a grey world going between the old and the new and you have to run the gauntlet.
Okay so all that fraud is going on for sure. But still in some ideal world it would be a pure arbitrage market - aka the bitcoin price should be the same everywhere. But it's not.
One common theme is one market where bitcoin prices are super high - on a major exchange. Who is it now, say it's bitfinex. And another market where bitcoin prices are super low - and that also will be a major exchange, say Kraken. So the arbitrageur wonders "what the hell, just buy from here and sell there, transfer the fiat, rinse and repeat and I'm rich. I'll start with $10k and in a week I'll have $12k, 20% fucking pure risk free arbitrage in a week!??!" and they get right on that.
The slightly smarter ones think - no, there has to be a trick, this must all be fake. Nope. I assure you those are the real prices on those markets. So what's the trick?
FIAT. BANKS.
The places where bitcoin prices are low are the places where you can actually sell your bitcoin and get fiat wired out. The trick is you have to pass AML/KYC and though you do get your money, you must be squeaky clean (like me) and the price you get for your bitcoin is super low there (say Kraken).
The places where bitcoin is high have screwed up or totally lack good fiat banking relationships, so the only way to get anything out (and/or get selectively scammed) is to buy bitcoin at nosebleed prices and flee before they get hacked again.
That's the real story. Funds are safe.
EDIT: following my own comment here, if you want bitcoin, take about six months to buy it. Cut up your purchases into at least 5 buys, maybe 10, maybe 20, maybe 100. After each fiat transfer and purchase, get your fucking bitcoin out of the exchange and to your wallet or cold storage. Never look back and don't try to trade bitcoin.

Inside, say nothing but a bitcoin address. If you give any other details like "for drugs" I turn it over to law enforcement. I want no fucking comments but a bitcoin address.
I pay 10% under Coinbase market rates.
I send back 1kg of Wyoming soil which is what you're actually buying, so give me a ground address to ship it to.
Minimum purchase is 1 bitcoin worth of cash. I decide how much bitcoin you get though. You could get zero and I could exit scam.
This is not a money transmitter, since you are buying soil. I guess you can put plants in it.

Eh, its possible they will pay out in yen. The Tokyo Whale sold tons of bitcoin for around $8000 each, and will probably pay back what the bitcoin was worth at the time of the hack, in yen. The remainder will either go back to Karpeles or be held up in lawsuits. It might make it back to account holders but it's hard to say. I think it does belong to them though.
If setting it right crashes the price, that's fine by me.
(I did not have coins at Mt Gox, I just think it's important to do the right thing)
Here's a take on it from the direction of US bankruptcy noticing how Japan is handling it. I quote the relevant part. I agree that the Japanese trustee will probably give account holders whatever they had in yen value at the time Mt Gox went bankrupt and then pocket the rest for itself (or maybe give it to Karpeles):
" Interestingly, the trustee administering Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy case has valued the claims of those creditors that lost bitcoins based upon the market price of bitcoins at the time of the bankruptcy filing, which was substantially lower than the value of bitcoin today. Based upon the lower value of these claims, the trustee could liquidate the bitcoin at current values, pay all creditors, and end up with a surplus of $1 billion.\[4\]"
EDIT2: One thing I think is kind of funny is that the Trustee may decide to liquidate all the rest of the bitcoin and pay Karpeles in yen! lol. I honestly think he is due a "refund" after bankruptcy if all the other claims are settled, so ... that might actually happen, one more last MEGA DUMP :) probably spread out over maybe 2 fucking hell months. Or the court could come up with some stupid reason why the State gets to keep the assets and then who knows. Whatever, Mt Gox goddamn it. Why did people keep funds there, goddamn. All you had to do was see he coded that shit in PHP and you knew instantly it was fucking trash.

The difficulty would adjust in a couple weeks. 
In the meantime, a 70% drop would mean blocks taking like 23 minutes on average to go through. They'd still go through though.
If two weeks later the difficulty was more than halved, then the block finding times go back to 10 minutes.
If Chinese miners come back online and add their hashpower, worst case it's a couple of weeks of rapid mining, like 4 minute blocks.
Then the difficulty adjusts ... and it's back to normal.

I would tell bankers and anyone else listening: It's not what YOU think is money that matters, money is a network effect thing. It's what OTHER people think of as money that matters. And it can change over time.
So money can be wampum, cattle, the Khan's silver certificates, Parmesan cheese wheels, gold, bitcoin, etc. A bank should deal with money in general. And what constitutes money can shift over time. It has to stay current and relevant. Oh or become irrelevant, which is maybe not a bad outcome either.

They're valid bitcoin transactions, but not played out to nodes, and not settled on the blockchain, only the channel open is settled, until you close it.
If channels stay open for a year, you have one tx go back to you, and another part to them. I don't see the problem. Even adding funds to a channel doesn't have to be done on a blockchain. You can give me $5, and I can give you some funds if you already have a channel. I can just push some satoshis to you. It's all valid bitcoin. When you want, 10 months later you can close your channel after making thousands and thousands of routed LN payments to other people's channels.
There is no dust like I think you're imagining.

What you're reading is correct - the winning mining pool gets the block and the fees.
When people participate in pools usually how they do it is they are told a range of numbers to search. The transaction they will write has all the payout information built into it to be valid, otherwise you're wasting your time and other miner's time.
So if your individual miner does find the block, the transaction you will mine WILL include the mining pool and whatever payouts it wants to send, and the transactions too. So it's not like you can play along and then secretly if you find the number, pay only to yourself.
That's the high level view of it.
If your pool does find some blocks, you get a share proportional to what you put in. I think pools charge something like 1-2% or less for organizing everything.

Yeah this is probably what happens. You give them bitcoin, they sell it immediately and give you a fiat loan. They also have just sold your bitcoin, so they easily have the cash to fund your loan, lol. If you default on your loan they don't owe you bitcoin anymore (and they don't have it). If bitcoin skyrockets in value, they go tits up and say "sorry!" and see you in bankruptcy court. But no one too big, so 25 bitcoin limit. They don't want to go up against a hedge fund's lawyers.
If bitcoin goes down in value to $1200 and you succeed in paying off your fiat loan, maybe they ask if you want your BTC back (easily done, they have the cash to buy the bitcoin at market prices and still have lots of profit). So all the bankers that think bitcoin is going to zero anyway (aka the fix is in), well here you go.
That might not be what's happening, but as I mull it over it seems a plausible possibility.

His point about unfreezable and not taxed offshore money (why pay tax to bring back offshore money, and also, good point about judges freezing a company's US bank accounts, which would make paying your employees, suppliers, and lawyers, while you mount a legal defense impossible. So they keep a good amount of money offshore because it would take forever to freeze those accounts, and they can use the money in the meantime to mount a legal defense and make payroll and keep the lights on.

Yeah a lot of altcoins are just attempts by latecoiners to scam/con people into buying their premine trash and then dump on the noobs.
(Exception I think is if you are hunting for a coin that has the weird features you are looking for and you are searching and searching, finally find it, and research it, and then buy like 1000 for pennies before anyone has heard of it. But that's because you personally needed it and hunted the Internet high and low looking for an overlooked project doing exactly what you needed.)
The noobs are into that big big payoff, and some will get it, but they rinse and repeat enough times and they are back to Square -1.
By the way I think it's ironically funny as hell that the guy who scammed the other guy and started Dogecoin got out of it before it got big, lol.  So the scammer idiot missed out on his own opportunity. Meme coin for the win, haha. (I have no doge, and do not encourage anyone to buy it ever)

I thought the comment about Sequioa Capital being pissed is accurate. (I don't know if htey were really involved)
But it seems to me the big capital firms / hedge funds thinking goes like this:
1) be in the shovel business not the gold mining business
2) try to find a market-cap weighted index of cryptocurrencies so you can be in on the next big thing
I think the first one gets them scammed. This is not an established industry space where you are safe to find the ones that service the cryptocurrency industry. The growth is too explosive, and the risk of being caught out like this, and thinking you know investments and valuations, it's not there.
Second one gets them scammed because despite best intentions probably 10-20% of the altcoins will make it. The rest the devs get their ICO money and development stops. 
Both cases would have been better off just  putting the money into bitcoin or go home.

American Banker had a good article on this once, the main thesis was that Money Laundering is Financial Thoughtcrime. Eg, you couldnt really tell all that easily that this customer doing this or that really is or isn't committing a crime. The view at a lone bank's level is not deep and horizontal enough for them to say anything about whether or not someone is a criminal except in the most egregious cases. The best they can really do is fill out a SAR. What sucks is all these companies get caught up in law enforcement and then can't explain to their customers, clearly, why their funds are frozen (law enforcement hold, and a gag order), so then the customers can't tell the difference between something they can pursue in court versus an exit scam or selective scamming. Meaning, in this case, the gag orders are the problem. If you're having your funds held (not your keys, not your bitcoin), then at least you need to know what court to take it to, who to sue, where to make your appeals and get your day in a court. Of course this is all related to the code is law movement, but that's a whole nother topic.

Yeah but the Chinese volume is frictionless, meaning bots can trade back and forth to each other nearly endlessly...
It would be like how many times could you shuffle a deck of cards, if every shuffle you took a card away? (Exaggerating obviously) So an exchange with fees is going to have damped down volume, and that's more the Western-style exchanges.
Not to say that real transactions aren't happening on Chinese exchanges... obviously if you run a bot that might be a good place to set up and do your algorithmic trading on bitcoin.
Oh and, that means that a lot of the trading isn't necessarily by Chinese for themselves, maybe the liquidity came from USA, Europe, etc, to China in order to trade.

You hear things about how big the blockchain is, say about 220 gigs now for bitcoin.
After you have the whole blockchain, if you really want to save space you can prune it, then it's about 3 gigs.
So what is it in bitcoin you're trying to do, if what you want to do is know that a payment is valid, you don't need all that information.
If you want to do things like chain analysis and things like that, then you would want the whole unpruned blockchain yeah.
But for basic payment purposes you could use the pruned one.
Next, a full node is best for your privacy. If you use SPV, I think that means simple payment validation, then that kind of wallet asks "is there bitcoin at this address? how about this other address?" so then the node your talking to could be a spy and think - "why are they asking? are those addresses someone paying them, or are they checking their balance? how interesting"
So for now, if you need to keep your privacy a little bit better in bitcoin you don't reuse addresses and you use a full node. You can attach a lightweight SPV and point it to your own node. That helps.
So then the weight of a node is a problem. That's a lot of disk. A purist would wonder, wait, I know bitcoin can do lots of other things, but say I just want to track unspent transaction output, that's what I need to know to know that these inputs here, and those outputs there are all not doublespent etc.
And then the next perspective is that you have to reverse something conceptually - addresses don't hold bitcoins in a balance. Instead, bitcoins have an address. It's kind of the reverse way of usually thinking about it.
Why is that a helpful perspective? Okay now you're moving the concept that bitcoins are somewhere (they can be divided and combined etc etc but the basic idea). Next, you track where those bitcoins are.
  
So you come up with an idea for an accumulator. You need something where you can prove that a utxo exists (adding it to the accumulator), that its valid (to spend, and then you delete it) and other bits.
So an accumulator is this really compact representation. You can ask an accumulator datastructure / value / algorithm - is this utxo in there and really spendable? And it gives you a yes or no. And then you can say, i fyou're the person with the wallet - okay, well Im spending it now, its valid, and you can delete it from the utxo. And the accumulator updates.
He did it with a Merkle tree, so its efficient-ish to store the existence and validity of a utxo and to remove it.
There are some holdups, one of them is why does a full node need to help you jump start this. So there's the idea of a bridge node, that has the full node knowledge, but keeps these utreexos for a new kind of wallet. 
If enough of the network, maybe &gt; 95% switches over to utreexos, then then there (my idea) might be a new middle state of nodes. IE, unless you're doing chain analysis, most nodes would be super small, maybe megabytes of storage? You wouldn't have a block explorer, but you could validate that utxo's were valid. Weird and interesting.
I could have misunderstood it, but that's what I was thinking they were saying.

Mmmmmm, I've learned that the one controversial belief I have about bitcoin is that I believe that Satoshi lost most of his bitcoin (lost the keys to them). 
Then I think he tried to get back into the game around the time GPU mining was figured out. 
But by then he was so far behind in having any stockpile of bitcoin that he gave up and left. He might have less than 100 coins.
That's what I believe, and that's why we might find Satoshi at conferences, here and there, but keeping a low and humble profile, because really, the coins are gone.
If he could, he would have signed a message by now. But nah, his keys are gone. So he watches from the sidelines, just happy that the experiment is going okay.

Yeah what happens sometimes is you have small communities that create electricity capacity as a way to lure smelters to their area.
Their secret hope is that cheap energy will make Alcoa show up and smelt aluminum and give their town blessed jobs.
Of course a bitcoin mining farm supplies a few jobs, but very very few. Soon it eats their cheap energy. And then they have a higher power bill. So they go "god damn it!" and rezone or whatever they want to do to charge these groups more money or ban them.
The thing is, the power was never for sale.
This is a warning to people like Alcoa that think these places have cheap power. They Don't.
What they have is the lure of cheap power, but if you actually go there and set up shop, they change the rules on you.
They can do that, but something I have thought of is coming up with a small independent smelter that is remotely controlled, melts crushed aluminum cans, smelts them there using their electricity. Loads the cooled smelted poured aluminum into ingots and ships it out. And provides absolutely zero jobs.
I literally would run it in a warehouse with only remote controlled robots and give the town absolutely zero jobs.
I bet they would kick that out of town too.
See, they clearly have no interest in actually supplying electricity at a fair rate. The whole thing is a scam to trick companies into coming to their towns.
They're just not very honest with themselves. Like saying its for the environment. The bitcoin miners should just buy their own renewable solar plant and use the waste heat for something, and mine away.
It would be a good idea to keep public track of these scammy communities which supposedly have cheap power, but actually don't and are using it as a cover for their jobs creation scams.
There was a community in upstate New York that did the same thing, same idea. They wonder why industry left.

Dollar cost averaging like that is just a way to control your emotions and to minimize how you can feel bad if as you buy in, the price falls.
The key idea is to recognize that the reason why we sell things like stocks, to buy things like bitcoin, is because our future expectations is that stocks will go down or not do as well as bitcoin will. But it's all up to chance a little bit since we can't know the future.
You are also most likely to have heard of something new to invest in after you are disappointed with one investment and actively looking for a better investment, it's just human nature. But overall, it tends to mean that you're selling something when it's down, and buying something when it's up. (Getting a bad deal on the sale, and then getting a bad deal on the purchase).
In order to avoid the hype cycle, you slowly reallocate assets. Like target some amount in net worth you want in bitcoin (1%, 5%, 10%), then take six months and slowly go over to that new number. Then you can buy/spend in bitcoin, or hold, whatever or makes sense for you then at that new point.
The super truth is that if you 100% know that an asset is going to go up in value, in the very near future, then you definitely obviously should put everything you have into that, and tell no one else about it.
BUT, who actually can see the future like that?? So that would be crazy and unwise. My advice is do not FOMO into anything ever.
It's never too late, you've never missed the boat, there is always another opportunity in life coming.

Yeah I'm hoping that more of the bitcoin miners find that they are right next to renewable inexpensive sources of electricity -- and that they notice that the bitcoin miner halflife of equipment is really short -- but that the electrical facility is not changing out their equipment nearly as fast. Maybe bitcoin miners will eventually move into an electricity-provider business. Since profitable bitcoin mining is really going to be about keeping up on the SHA256 technology front, as well as having a good cheap source of electricity. They might eventually realize that running the powerplant is a better source of income than mining bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:45:13
Yeah I agree, if I was a miner, I'd only sell in blocks of 25/50/100 bitcoin, never such a large number all at once. Too big a risk of having fiat accounts frozen. Legacy banking will fuck you every time. They basically have to, they just pony out some show of AML\KYC, answer no questions, claim "compliance", and the music stops, party's over, and you're out the bitcoin, and the bank has your funds frozen.

What part of using bitcoin there is unbelievable?
(Actually much as I hate Dash, it seems they and Doge are both pushing to be useful in this crisis)
If it's the lack of electricity, that's not 100% true in all places.
You can charge your phone from a car cigarette lighter to USB (or solar, if you have that, I have that, I don't live in Venezuela)
And then the cell towers have their own power generators
And the cell towers should be able to reach the Internet and as far as I know, both phone calls and Internet access go over MPLS, so it all should be fine. If you have one (the ability to make international calls) you should have the other (the Internet). 
The Internet is pretty important, people would probably try to restore the Internet before almost anything else. Even power lines to homes. Because you can have power with generators, generators at the cell towers, etc. The Internet and cell phone service is crucial.

Thanks you said it way better than me. 
If a company came there and used the electricity to make beer and give them jobs, they would be cheering.
It's not that they just want to sell electrical power. They want to subsidize industries with cheap electricity so they can get jobs and tax base. It all seems so reasonable until you realize they have their hooks in you like parasites and the power rates aren't "real", those are "friend prices". 
And once they raise the price on you for reasons ... searches the excuses bag ... "renewable energy" (fine something that everyone loves), then you realize you could have made your own renewable energy plant as well and be done with these shady towns.
EDIT: I think the peaceful way to approach this if I was the crypto miner is to say "we are here to buy the variable base load. Meaning : we scale back our usage during peak demand for all customers, and we guarantee we'll buy at good rates when other customers aren't using it. We aren't trying to kill the planet, we are making it so that the town has inexpensive electricity when they need it. This amortizes the cost of the plant and is good for everyone." You know, how you get more flies with honey than vinegar, sigh.

Unfortunately, gasoline is radically cheap in Venezuela. (It's unfortunate because it's government subsidized, so it's at unrealistically low prices).
Also, gas stations do need electricity to power their pumps. That said, a person could surely go for a day or two, or potentially a week, charging devices with the gas they have in their car.

There's no terms of service on twitter that says people have to be real.
And parody is protected speech.

Its not dangerous advice at all.
Start over, ignore bitcoin for a second, and imagine stocks.
When an old person who has stock, is selling it to a young person who wants stock, what might they be doing? One way to look at it is as a rebalance of risk/reward. Different time horizons, different needs for money, one old needs money, one young wants to play the odds. Time preference, etc.
So it's not like stocks automatically have some expected value &gt; 1 as a multiplier. I think bitcoin is a better use of small amounts of money than the lottery. If they wanted to they could try buying Microsoft or other FANG stocks when they're young.
But if they wanted to make a play using bitcoin, it's not invalid. It's a bit trolly to post it under investing subreddit since they hate bitcoin. But I think they're a little bit blind and biased.

Yeah pretty good paper, has some nice comparisons of Facebook stock price (some was pre-IPO) - only thing is I thought they were picking out periods where they thought bitcoin wasn't manipulated and curve fitting there. I think they are thinking that the bubble part of bitcoin isn't Truth, that was is or was all manipulation except when it hugs that lower bound of the upward curve in price. And as to that, nah, I think that mania and price drop is part of the whole story. So I would shift upwards the value curve slightly. That means bitcoin is currently a bit undervalued or just doing fine at the current price despite all the drama.

I know most people don't have one, but I have a solar charger for my phone. It has a battery and a USB output so I can charge up no problem if there is no power.

It's caused by Tether imbalances and difficulties or ease of withdrawls of either USD or BTC on one end or another of the exchanges.
The simple answer is that Tether, Ripple, and other stablecoins and transfer of value coins exist because banks and AML/KYC get in the way. If the bank systems would stop being in the way, you wouldn't need these transfer of value coins.
These coins will always have problems. If they didn't have problems, you wouldn't need them.
These coins can also be scams because there is never any possibility of proof that could satisfy anyone that they're not scams. They're simply fiat created out of thin air by a centralized group to match hypothetical balances. Since they claim to be stablecoins, but have to float on an open market, you can wonder why they would ever be imbalanced, but it's pointless to worry about it.
Mainly, use a coin like Tether to get your bitcoin, then get your bitcoin off the exchange.

Oh thats interesting. So if someone had 100 bitcoin with Mt Gox when they went bankrupt ...
Mt Gox got hacked and lost 750,000 bitcoin but found and saved 200,000 bitcoin. 
The Trustee sold just enough bitcoin to pay back the market price at the time in yen (but I'll use dollars for this.) So they have about 20 bitcoin for every 100 you had at the site. They sold some, so you get just enough sold to give you $440 \* 100 (the price of bitcoin at the time, times the amount you had as a balance at the time) - so you get $44k back.  They still have around 140,000 bitcoin. So someone starting with 100 bitcoin, will get back now \~$44k and \~14 bitcoin.  Ah that'd be nice :) it's something, not ideal. But something.
If you'd never been hacked, you'd have 100 bitcoin. Market value \~$400,000.  (could have been almost 900% gains)
If you go through this, you get \~$44k and \~14\*$4000 (in bitcoin value) =  \~$100,000  (eh about 150% gains)
Ah rats, well it's something. Mt Gox got hacked pretty hard.
From there they could either buy bitcoin or sell bitcoin.

Probably around $5000-$10000 if you wanted 20 TB SSD right now.
It would be cheaper to buy a small amount of storage and add to it as you go.
In 10 years, 20 TB SSD will cost around $50.
But if you have to buy as you go, buying 2 TB a year, you could spend $600 this year, $300 next, $150 after that, etc. By the time it's 10 years later it would have cost you under $1200
A little more expensive would be to buy 2 TB this year, 4 TB next, etc, but since the prices are falling as you grow linearly, it might cost just under $2000 in the end going that route. Easier than adding and adding and adding capacity. Just completely replace the capacity each year. It would be surprisingly cheap to do that.
(That's also why blockchain bloat is a non-worry as far as storage, but still a problem for network communications, because the bandwidth of home networks in the USA is not growing that fast - it could sometime later - but for now network bandwidth grows slower than storage costs get cheaper)

If you buy on the dips and just nibble at walls when it's safe, you can work at it and barely move the price.
If you deliberately sell a very small amount after someone else makes big buys, or deliberately buy a small amount after big sells, then you can "paint the tape" and create a mirage of the price either rising or falling.
In bitcoin land, it's like an unregulated stock market (well, barely regulated), and lots of interesting things are okay in bitcoin land :)

I'm not sure. 
I think my instincts on things are often just absolutely wrong. Example - like in 1990 or so, if you had said - hey the Internet is coming, and people could work remotely, could live anywhere, and unless you have to be physically present to do a job (plumbing work, construction), -- like if you have a white collar job - you could live \*anywhere\* - well I would have expected that people would live in far off inexpensive places.
But I was totally wrong, and people are piling into major cities instead. Example Japan - people pouring into Tokyo, and leaving other cities behind. There's some effect that is driving people into large cities. Almost like - if you could hold a globe in your hands and a city is important enough to be on that hand-held globe, then that's going to be a city where value in real estate will go up. Every unnamed place though, will probably go into decline.
Bitcoin is a tricky store of value. When bitcoin goes up in value, newcomers have choices. Some of them are technical enough to just spin and hype a new token, and some new comers are looking for hot fresh altcoins that they can buy cheap and sell for 1000x gains later. Against that continuous wash of scam coins, bitcoin has a hard time. Plus, goofy ass market cap stats on coins that are premined corporate scam coins (like Ripple) or ones where the various incentives are completely asinine (Zcash - 20% to devs), or where making big online stakes/staking encourages big purchases (Dash), or goofy coins with goofy communities and made up value (Dogecoin, Steem, whatever), those coins all take a bite of 1% or 2% or 10% at a time from the cryptocurrency market.
Well, we'll see how it turns out.

Logically Tether cuts out the banks ability to interfere in the wire transfers of value.
Tether can have US banks in USD amounts, and US-side customers at these banks, and then have other overseas customers. Tether can choose to either have banking relations on both sides, or if there's ever an imbalance left to right, it can make Tether be $0.99 each on one side and $1.01 on the other side, and the imbalances will get cancelled out by the users.

I don't think that disk space is as big a problem as the openness (lack of privacy) on the transactions. It should be mandatory (unlike Zcash) that all addresses just can't be chain-analyzed. Having a rich list even be possible is a negative. They should use maths to prove that the input totals equal the output totals and that each transaction in the bundle is properly signed and all, but not be able to tell where the ins and outs are going, and then have some kind of system to make it so that your old transactions echo a few times downstream to help others out too. And that it not be optional.

If someone is putting a transaction in that's very small, that might be "dust". It can be a way to send a little note, or put a tag out on the blockchain instead of into a database, or someone might be dusting your old address in order to figure out what kind of wallet software you use. Do you use the kind that looks at the blockchain and gathers everything up, or just what it remembers being there, etc. You can't stop people from dusting things.
If you see, instead, that little transactions are being spent out from a big old cold addresses cold storage - and that these are valid transactions - getting mined - that means someone (else) has the private key.

Other people have pointed out the obvious part. That yes while there are 21 million bitcoin, you can actually subdivide it already quite a lot further. I think there are actually 2100 quadrillion satoshi:
How many satoshis are there (or at maximum)? This many:
Now a little bit above that smallest number, I think around 100 satoshi, is effectively the smallest message and the fees are down near there too. The fees for things are paid for by the byte. 
Bitcoin messages like "Pay from these inputs to those outputs" are little programs.
Bringing this all together, the smallest usable pieces of bitcoin are extremely small. You can use those to pay contracts and track little notes of information on the blockchain.
IF you want to treat bitcoin like it's a money though, then people usually think in terms of whole bitcoin, but all a whole bitcoin is "Good for" is for being able to run more of these tiny programs or run them more often.
But that is a bit deeper level to bitcoin.
At the usual level, most people are thinking of it like bitcoin is a money itself (like a dollar).

The value of bitcoin - bigger than it's market cap - is how much value (sure in a reference like dollar exchange value) was pushed around by bitcoin in 2016 - something like 80 billion dollars?

Eh don't feel bad, I didn't buy or sell either bitcoin nor bcash (nor bcash sv, much as I think that coin sucks).
High level, money is a network effect and a market wide decision. You just made a high risk / high payoff play.
I made the most neutral decision you could make, neither buy nor sell either side of that fork, and neither buy nor sell bitcoin to dollars over it either.  
  
Backing up, what bitcoin cash is doing is both simple yet politically not so easy. To have big blocks they did have to hard fork, and now I think they are committed to a hard fork every six months where they can fight over another detail. That gets more stupid over time. It could get better but it might easily get worse.
What bitcoin did with SegWit, to me, does not look like a very good way to go about things, but given how bitcoin works, how do you otherwise get a lot of people on board unless you do it like they did. So ... there you go.

Not too much, Tether helps cut the banks eyes out of the situation.
Banks see money moving intra-bank, left pocket to right  pocket between two different customers at the same bank (okay), and then inter-bank from one business to the same business at a different bank (okay)
Tether prevents banks from understanding the actual flows of money. So Tether makes it harder for the fiat system to act to stop it. The only thing that stops Tether really is large cash withdrawls from one bank by someone somewhere. Then the brakes go on.

Eh, well you can use bitcoin as as settlement system. Bitcoin, directly, is not going to be VISA.

Well ... solar power is essentially a very large number and largely left uncollected. So you have all that power from the sun. 
Then matter and material, besides some rare metals, you can find the atoms that make things up all over the place. Like aluminum is in the soil and it's kind of common. We just use an ore because it's more plentiful in an ore. But if we didn't have a concentrated source, we still have nearly unlimited solar power and all that matter out there.
So maybe there's something to the idea that resources are limited just by human imagination.

Well the deep truth is that there's a lot of energy production potential but what happens is the energy is produced somewhere by a plant or facility with usually a large capital investment. They need return on investment. 
It can be tough to store the energy. And it can be tough to transmit it to customers, or to find customer uses that can use it right there at the source. The usual fantasy is to find an aluminum smelter and get jobs and a tax base. A bitcoin mine is typically not going to produce tons of local jobs. So that's a downside from government's point of view. (Jobs = happy voters).
But at least the group that made the electricity can have a base customer willing to buy excess power, and that helps them recoup their renewable energy cost. And eventually they will be able to transmit it to customers like residents and industry some distance away. First, the installation has to be break-even or profitable. Bitcoin mining can make more renewables at least viable.

They can always make up their own transactions and mine those, to arbitrarily fill blocks.
But if you mean, can we make it so that miners don't realize what they're mining (except that inputs and outputs look right) --
Yes, then you should support MAST. MAST lets you write your bitcoin transactions (little programs) in such a way that they hide their functionality until the last moment. Now when something is finally being revealed they can realize that they can still choose to mine or not mine this transaction, but the setup for it could have been mined into the blockchain a long time ago, and no one is going to undo a years old blockchain to prevent the newly presented transaction from being invalidated.
It comes a step closer ... 
So add in some things like stealth addresses so you don't know who's being paid, or add in some cross chain swaps so people lose track of the specifics, and you can work around the problems.

His disconnect is that he doesn't realize that scarcity and utility together, along with a utility that still functions even through divisibility (you don't have to have "whole" bitcoins to get a function of exchanging value) - this helps drive the price.
What's 'scarce' is bitcoins. Cryptocurrencies are not scarce of course - but the other ones are not quite as usable (have the same utility) because they're not recognized and easily exchanged. You can go through middlemen like shapeshift.io of course, but then you take a haircut (which you deserve but of course there are exchange risks and shapeshift and the like deserve to get paid for taking them).

Okay that's a lot of euros you are talking about.
Don't buy bitcoin for other people. Have them buy their own. 
Maybe an exception is for a relative, and only for small amounts.
A common scam is to send someone PayPal money, then ask that person to buy gift cards or buy them bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. 
Maybe to cash a check for them, or you cash a check and send them bitcoin.
With bitcoin, there is no police or bankers that can get that money back. If you send someone bitcoin, it is GONE. 
bitcoin is much more secure than euros, in that the government can't seize it (not easily), but that works both ways.
What scam artists do is convince people to take something that isn't cash (not really) and buy and send them bitcoin. 
These are large large amounts of money you are talking about. There are places where you can buy bitcoin over the counter (OTC), here's an article about OTC brokers:
Or you can talk to a bitcoin exchange, contact a helpdesk. Kraken is reputable, but others could probably help you.
But I would never send them 1.3 million euros and expect them to do anything but seize the money and call the police. 
So only send in what you could afford to lose, mabye 1% of that, like 13,000 euros. Then see if they send you around 3.1 bitcoin back. If you can do that reliably, you are fine. 
Then someday, maybe 10, maybe 20 purchases later, they seize the money. This is sadly normal. The banking system does NOT want money to become bitcoin. Eventually they put pressure on exchanges. Also, exchanges don't necessarily mind seizing your money. oh no, government made us do it (also, your seized money helps pay for their expensive coffees) Since they never have to pay you, they get to use your money while you wait, forever.
Whatever is going on here, I would run away from it if I were you. 
If this is YOUR euros, not someone else's, contact bitstamp.net, or Kraken, or Binance, Gemini, Coinbase, somewhere large and reputable. You have to decide if you want that to be an exchange outside the US (I would recommend you avoid the US if you can, if you are not from the US). Use the exchange of a country that's friendly to your country, etc.
I would say don't do anything until you see maybe 10 more people comment on this. I think most will see red flags / signs of danger / and encourage you not to do this. 
It's not that we don't want people to buy bitcoin, but these are large sums and they're for someone else. Buy bitcoin for people on commission? This is a red flag.  They can buy their own.

Oh thanks buddy..
Yes bitcoin is very interesting. With that initial explanation of mine, here's a few more interesting things you might like --
1) the original bitcoin whitepaper! :) pretty cool once you see it layed out, you can handwave or skip / read fast over it to see how it's layed out.  
2) you can buy bitcoins from an ATM or localbitcoins or from a friend and stay more anonymous, or you can sign up to something like Coinbase or an exchange and send in a lot of KYC (know your customer) documentation. Then the system will tie your bitcoin addresses to you, pretty firmly. You can still lose your bitcoin, give them away as gifts, suffer tragic hard drive accidents, or have the bitcoins stolen, and/or actually spend them at Overstock or something so it's not like the system truly "knows" what you're doing but they can strongly believe things...
3) bitcoins can get stolen, but not directly off the blockchain. Some ways it gets stolen: you get malware when you download wallet software - like a Trojan horse. The website you use to generate bitcoin addresses is hacked and generates addresses that look random but aren't random enough, or are totally under the control of the attacker. You could get a web bug that spots bitcoin addresses on the clipboard and when you cut and paste, pastes in a destination address the attacker (and not you) has the private key for. They could find your wallet.dat file with a google search. They take over the hosting company for your virtual machine you run a node and wallet on... etc. Get creative. The main weakness is going to be your endpoint, not the blockchain.
4) other cryptos work differently. Some are bitcoin clones but others are creative. A lot are premined scams.

I think part of it is cultural too. In India (never been there) it seems like the police have more powers to decide that someone's actions are a serious crime, and to arrest them without a warrant. They call the distinction "cognizable offense" and a "non-cognizable offense". Meaning, if the crime would typically have a 3+ year sentence (like money laundering would, or financing terrorism), then the cops can just arrest you! Things that in USA would be white collar crimes and maybe have the FBI or Secret Service or SEC on you, in India, it seems like ordinary cops can go into a building and arrest people for things that wouldn't be done that way in USA.
It's a special thing about how their legal system works.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:42:26
Hmm kind of true. I would have normally replied with don't buy anything but bitcoin, but bitcoin cash is muddying those waters. There are also some other altcoins I think are good, but I don't want to shill them, since I think people have to think for themselves about what they want out of a crypto and find that. Maybe just don't invest all at once, FOMO is not healthy, do small things and learn as you go. Contain your risk, stay skeptical, but take a plunge here and there.
Maybe Malta will be okay. I think that people are assuming a lot more State level enforcement of things makes everything better, when in fact I think it just helps people get scammed more or has very little effect.

Sure you bet, and one of the things I didnt understand about bitcoin for a while is that it has a scripting language built into it, and bringing together inputs, sending to outputs and signing something to prove you control the inputs unlocking, is part of a script language built into bitcoin.

Look, others disagree, and I'm a big bitcoin supporter, but I would never use bitcoin on darknets. It's just not meant for that. Try a different coin entirely, something with privacy always-on, not opt-in.
And bigger picture, bigger meta, say you are into darknets so you can buy pot. Big picture LEAVE the area you are in if pot is illegal. MOVE to an area where it is legal - West coast USA, or some parts of Europe are safe. The main idea is to think hard about what darknet markets are distributing and make a choice to live somewhere with better freedoms and probably avoid darknet markets would be my advice.
Eg why get a prison sentence in a USA red state that makes pot illegal, when you could just MOVE to San Francisco or Portland or somewhere cool.  Vote with your feet! :)

Sure, bitcoin has a transparent ledger.
You can check out  to see a 'block explorer' which shows bitcoin blocks and the transactions inside etc.
Here are some other beautiful visualizers of the blockchain and transactions:
Bitcoin transactions take inputs (that were outputs from previous transactions), and then make new outputs. Common would be to have one input, and maybe two outputs - one out to someone you're trying to pay and another one back to yourself as change.
When someone wants to move bitcoin from an old output, they have to sign a transaction and prove they had the private key basically. 
Users don't have ids. Bitcoin outputs do have a bitcoin address.
When a block is mined, the miners can choose whether or not to include other transactions. Most of the time they pick some that they think are valid and who implicitly are paying some nice fees (the fee is calculated as the amount from input to output where if there's a little bit too little output, the missing amount must be the fee they want to pay.) -- so when miners mine, they get the coinbase amount (what's it at now, 12.5? used to be 50, got cut in half to 25, got cut in half again now to 12.5;)) - they get the coinbase in bitcoin plus the fees of all the transactions in the block.
Nodes take the block, doublecheck its valid proof of work (did enough work), and that all the transactions inside are valid, and add that to the end of the blockchain.
The blocks point backwards in their header to the previous block they're building on. Sometimes the blockchain reorganizes, like if someone else finds two other blocks in quick succession and therefore has more "work" done on it. Old transactions might be undone, or redone in new blocks etc if that happens.
The proof of work is a thing by itself but basically the miners take a random number, do SHA256 on it, and look for leading zeros. The number of leading zeros is the difficulty, and it's increasing because more hashpower is trying to get the reward.
Every couple of weeks the mining difficulty recalculates. The target is that in two weeks, the pace should be a block every 10 minutes. But it's random and sometimes you could get lots of blocks rapidly, and other time wait hours for a block.
Sometimes blocks are empty, that might be an attack or a hack on proof of work that people don't understand, or it might be that the miner is being lazy (if all miners never mine transactions, then why are we trying to use bitcoin as a system? self-defeating). But other times when blocks just come out, there can be a few seconds or minutes where the miner's own node has to figure out what's been validated and then pick new transactions for a new block. In the meantime their hardware can't just wait, so they give them work to do - mining an empty block.
If the miners do get a block, the coinbase transaction (that now 12.5 bitcoin) has to wait 100 confirmations before they can spend that one. Everyone else only has to wait 1 confirmation (I think). Normal people consider things pretty settled after about 6. It gets exponentially unlikely to be able to reverse the blockchain. Think of the depth as like an exponent, one or two blocks maybe you could undo if you were a big miner, but 6+ blocks, wow.
People can't steal bitcoins very easily because they can't break the public-private encryption system. If people keep their private keys secret then you can't just steal bitcoin or take them back.
People can somewhat be tracked down in bitcoin, in that the transactions are publicly visible and you can see bitcoin outputs coalescing sometimes around big wallets and be able to identify bitcoin exchange wallets, top holders, or maybe your customers wallet if you've sent them some items.
Bitcoin transactions have to be transmitted to a node or direct to a miner's node in order to get mined. So you could do that over the open Internet, or over the Internet but with https, or over Tor and the onion network, etc. It would be harder to figure out where someone is if they're privately submitting their transactions and covering their trail.
Bitcoin is decentralized, but it also follows rules. In theory, the bitcoin network could invalidate a set of transactions but that's not in bitcoin's social culture.
Over in Ethereum, another blockchain, they undid their blockchain's contract to bail out themselves and those in a thing called the DAO, and that caused a stir, and a fork to Ethereum Classic. 
But in bitcoin, there is a more settled culture of no takebacks ever.
Not sure I answered it all? Hope this helps.

That makes sense, maybe you could solve not the full SHA256 at the total difficulty, but contribute a solution within a minute of the last block that was the best you could do. Then choose some large number like 64, 128, or 256 best partial solutions if the block is not solved in 10 minutes as adequate proof of work as long as the work of all of those partial solutions was good enough. And if they were, they could get a payout in fraction to their contribution.

Bitcoin cash is a fork, it has kind of a different idea of where bitcoin should go. Most bitcoin miners and nodes, etc went with regular bitcoin, a bit different path.
Well if you have an e-commerce website, how do you take payments now, integrated a cart with something? Similar idea, you can accept bitcoin and turn it right to dollars, or a few percent in bitcoin etc.
The buyers can't chargeback and reverse a bitcoin payment, so its safer for the merchant.
If it's a big ticket item, both sides can use escrow etc.

Well I'll just say that you're doing the right thing by calling out whoever and whatever you think is a shady scam.
I guess I just thought that everyone knew that half the exchanges out there are shady, and to get in, get your bitcoin, and get out. Don't day trade it. Don't put in your life savings. Do not FOMO into coins. Even bitcoin has shady alts that pretend to be bitcoin so it's hard for newcomers to know they have the the real thing, which is a bit unfortunate.... And yeah prices for bitcoin even are often $100 apart even on world-class exchanges which just highlights the difficulty of doing actual arbitrage. And, all the KYC/AML in the world doesn't stop the scammers etc.
And then on these exchanges, you have dodgy order books, dark orders, flash walls to buy and sell, bots, and some really advanced stop loss hunting stuff, plus they open their books to some traders so some people can see more than you. Etc! And like you point out, fake volume. So yeah it's shady as fuck. AND they are never going to be under some coordinated regulation, and I don't even want regulation. So buyer beware.

It's nice to have non-hysterical coverage, but this section, ow: 




The fixed maximum of bitcoins, 21 million, is not the problem. It's the number of transactions that can be supported. Simplistically speaking, the blocks are too small to have more transactions in them. (But of course solutions can be engineered for that problem... some simple some complex with different side effects).


As we are all familiar.


No comment other than I think the solution is in plain sight - merge mining bitcoin clone-coins and having many parallel bitcoin(s) blockchains without risking any of them against the hashpower. Merge mining could support so many alt-bitcoin chains it's ridiculous - and ALL of them could be nearly as secure as the main bitcoin chain.
They might want to do a combination of merge-mining their code and adding something special so that someone with merely fast SHA256 hashing alone can't jack your coin around.


Bitcoin is the probable winner for money. Right now bitcoin's privacy problems are driving Monero and other privacy centric coins up, because this is a problem with bitcoin right now.  But I believe the biggest value (Bitcoin) continuously attracts new value to itself as the most valued coin and acts like a Singularity of cryptocurrencies (given, it has some limitations, which help create the altcoin markets).


Jeff's quote here, true or not (assume a true quote), is like the normal fog that something like the BBC would print.
If they understood bitcoin they would say: join in if you want to, but be responsible and do not sink into it money that you can't afford to lose. It may be the next Railroad type technology, but a lot of investors in early railroads got fleeced, others made fortunes.
Watch out for bitcoin imitators like - OneCoin.

Like the fellow who posted about having $4 million in bitcoin that he mined when it was worth pennies.
The good news is that his cost basis is negligible. 
So the good news for him is he doesn't have to prove anything about what the real basis was, because it was so small it doesn't matter.

Right all the alts really form an altcoin marketplace where they can go to or from each other and bitcoin.
Once you have that in a large enough volume, thinking thousands of coins and trivial to exchange, hopefully most of these coins will be somewhat comparable in privacy (all private) but maybe some coins will be deliberately transparent (more so than bitcoin) while others deliberately very obscure except for some properties (like being able to sign a message to an address to prove you control value, and maybe knowing the total coins out now and issued in each block - if it works that way for that coin).
Etc the more the merrier, all hail bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:35:00
Eh sure somewhat. 
Long run, you will have a few miners decide to skip transactions and just mine empty blocks as an FU to people that put in low fees. Then other miners will sweep up those higher-paying fees. I would expect that the fees paid would sawtooth as every few blocks the ones paying good fees get swept up and collected. Hey free bitcoin. But long run fees will never really be free but they'll be a fraction of the mined amount. Maybe 4% something like that, something worth your while but not crazy good.

Well, that's okay, but part of what I'm thinking is that I'd like to see a move to Georgism (land value tax) being the only tax.
Anyway, then tax evasion goes away because the only tax is on land, and bitcoin fits into that larger hope of mine.
All I can say is that in my larger point of view, I have a lot less need for government than other people do.
The main starting point is to not require everyone to meet my standards and to use government force to make them, but to find market ways to do it, or co-op / free choice ways.
I would use government to address market failures, fraud, crime, war between nation-states, etc. So in my dreams the government would still exist, but it would do a lot less and be less of a meddler in people's lives.
Where it gets tricky is when we define what a crime is. This is often a way (like the War on Drugs) to fight a culture war against leftists and minorities.

Yeah I think that because bitcoin is more like a currency / store of value, it's going to be really interesting if it eats into the notional value of gold (in the trillions, 4 or 5 trillion?) or into the notional value of FOREX (in the quadrillions).
I don't have a crystal ball, but the numbers get nuts really fast.
Bitcoins current price reflects what the Market thinks right now what the future value is (in tension), so right now the Market doesn't agree .... but the higher the price goes (if the liquidity and volume is there too), the more bitcoin can do and the higher it can go.

Sure, just to make sure we are mostly on the same page ....
labor and capital, and here the farmer might be a skilled laborer (give them the benefit of the doubt) and assume that the farmer - already has land, has some skilled labor suited to farming and not to other white collar work, and already produces food at some rate, which could be improved by taking a loan, buying capital goods, and then improving production.
In the meta, he might himself be like a farming corporation that in a sense the bank is investing in, and we could be more generous and assume its some kind of hayseed bank that's actually a co-op or something less cancerous than most banks.
Well this farmer, if he could earn more money by buying Microsoft stock than investing it in his farming, then he should do that. 
But say he has no money, he is allowed to borrow, but only if he comes up with an attractive business plan. Assuming no subsidies, he has to convince the bank to work with him instead of investing their funds with Microsoft.
Now, if out there, there is some new commodity, and this commodity is not going to be used by the farmer - say copper ingots - and he personally has no use for them, but just believes that copper is going to go into electronics (say its 1910, so maybe a reasonable presupposition by a forward-thinking farmer) - well he could try to get loans to buy commodities, but problem solved, no bank will lend to a speculator for that.
So he'd have to really really really believe, considering he can just go get loans and pay the bank back and get maybe 20x the outcome.
Where I'm going with this is that you can't really compare farming and all the subsidies and even the fact that his labor is super focused on that, plus he already has land, and a provable business plan -- 
It would be super hard for this hypothetical farmer to invest very much in copper (bitcoin) anyway, since no one is going to give him big loans for a speculation like that (nor should they).
That doesn't make bitcoin bad, it just has to be better than the alternatives available.
I mean, I have no problem with bitcoin just being held by true believers, it's nothing to me if there's a delay in it's growth. (I have bitcoin, but also other investments).
SUMMARY: if bitcoin, as a commodity, despite all the volatility, is still producing massive year on year returns to speculators, then it deserves to be the thing people speculate some tiny portion on, until it stops producing massive year on year returns. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. It doesn't make it irrational to be into bitcoin though. And lots of people can get BETTER returns than bitcoin by doing simple things like taking care of their health, getting a college degree, getting a cool Youtube channel going, or having whatever hustle takes a business from an idea to a million or a billion dollar valuation.

Its going to be easier to try to crack old versions of bitcoin addresses ... If the address was spent from and then reused as a destination.

About Fungibility, here's a cool article on what's called CoinValidation and an old Scottish case about stolen (but marked) banknotes --
The essential trouble is that some people think that some bitcoins are cleaner than others, and that affects how easily you can spend them. Example is if Coinbase has a customer that buys bitcoin and then spends them on gambling, which they can think is happening because they see the bitcoin get transferred to a cloud of addresses related to an online gambling site, then they can cut off that customer from buying bitcoin. It starts there. It works in reverse too, the gambling site might transfer bitcoins from that cloud of addresses into Coinbase to cash out, and find that a) they have transferred the bitcoins "in" to coinbase, but b) can't turn it into dollars out, c) and could get their account locked for violating terms of service, and d) have a long interview with law enforcement or something.
But what if the person is two or three downstream? Received bitcoin from a gambling site, unknowingly, then wants to spend at Overstock and can't? 
Those are all fungibility issues. One bitcoin should ideally be as acceptable as another, but in reality, there is this idea (purely in your head) of "taint" that go along with a source of funds. 
Maybe it's not "imaginary", but anyway it's an issue for any currency. And since bitcoin was supposed to help us all avoid the problems of intermediaries, bleh, you wind up having to trust people when you transfer bitcoins to their control and they can deny you business etc based on the source of your bitcoins or use the source as justification for seizing your coins etc.
Also, kind of off-topic but similar, if you have bitcoins on an exchange, what you REALLY have is an IOU.
If you don't control the private keys, you don't control the bitcoin. Maybe legally you "own" it, but sometimes there's nothing you can do to get the bitcoin back, functionally, without the keys.

Check out that paper, I skimmed it, it seems right.
The first defense is to not reuse addresses.
Next, if you have the quantum computing power to steal from RIPEMD-160 / SHA256 public addresses, then you have the power to mine bitcoin - logically it should be easier to mine it than to steal it. If you were going to steal it, the payout might as well make it worth it?  (Don't store thousands of bitcoin at one address maybe?)
But stealing bitcoin that way only works if you want to destroy bitcoin. Is this the cheapest way to destroy bitcoin?
And I could get behind a fork that avoided SHA256 for something else or a hybrid, if people were obviously mining with quantum computers.
And their napkin math said something like 2330 qubits to do the stealing. Maybe less to mine it. How many qubits are people at now? 50? 100? So you have time, not to be complacent...

Contextually I meant - say a robber steals from someone. Then runs out and on a spree spends money at restaurants and on clothes and going out to the movies, and gets away with it for --- years.
Then, one day, you catch the robber. You are not going to actually go out and recover $20 movie tickets, and $5 from the hamburger guy. What I'm driving at is that if robbers actually run off and spend the money, you don't run around in the community and recall the cash. 
You could, like say they spend it on one big thing like a house or a car, you could seize that, of course.

Oh it might not, I expect trash coins to multiply and multiply. In the end, a lot of their value is fantasy.
So example, once upon a time a few years ago, there were altcoins then, and bitcoin dominance as percentage of marketcap was higher.
Now many of those altcoins are totally gone, or have not grown in value as fast as bitcoin.
But even though they have gone, there are MORE trash scam altcoins than ever (ICOs)
In the future there will be thousands or tens of thousands of altcoins. Some will be for sale in just a few markets or on a few exchanges.
Even now, take Lykke for example - I'm not shilling it, but it's an interesting coin that I thought had merit and I wanted to buy some - that's an altcoin I really wanted to buy. But if you're from USA and not the EU, it's quite tricky to get some. So just that one altcoin - I am not really sure that it even compares to bitcoin, really.
Anything past the top 20 alts of today is probably going to have a hard time. Some gems might survive. Hard to say.

Ah you know, it's tough. If people keep producing and generally keeping floating some other 'bad money' and using that as currency - then you should use that as a currency too.
I know that sounds weird.
Here's why. 
If you are in Venezuela, paid in bolivars, and those are terrible, then you want to spend them to buy stuff. Let's say you try to buy flour and cooking oil to make arepas. You also quickly, desperately, do something like buy a junky used car - because even that holds value better than a bolivar. You also maybe get some dollars and store some value there.
Now you're working some side jobs and you have a lot of hustle, but above your bare minimum needs, you only sometimes have *extra* money. That extra money, you sink into stores of value. 
The bolivars, you get rid of those *as fast as possible* - and spend those on only essentials. The extra bolivars - those you spend *as fast as possible* and you convert them to stores of value.
Now if everyone else is blind to the value of stores of value, or just doesn't have enough bolivars as cash to do more than buy the essentials - look, that's a bad situation - but you are just acting in your own self-interest. (And maybe your family's interest).
So now, in this analogy, you can see, clearly - the bolivar may be the currency, but the stores of value are junky used cars and dollars. 
This is going to continue until enough people have dollars and just fucking give up on the bolivar and the whole shit show collapses.
THATS what I am saying is happening in bitcoin --
Just substitute bolivars with dollars, and substitute dollars with bitcoin. 
SAME situation. bitcoin is a better money, end of story, bye bye dollars. 
That said, it can take a while before the current shit show falls apart.
Your strategy should be to get dollar-denominated debts, like borrow money to buy a house, and borrow money - in dollars - to start a business --
And on the side, stack bitcoin. 
THEN later, when the shit show falls apart, when the debts are easy to pay off, and you have the assets AND the bitcoin.
Okay that might not happen :) 
But that's the fever dream / "logic".
And, LONG TERM, like 60+ years, ALL of the wealth of the world will turn over. People die of old age, and somehow that wealth has to transfer to other people's ownership. So there's always a long rolling changeover of wealth. This is a process that mostly passes the wealth of 80 year olds to 60 year olds ;)

Yes it's possible that the Velocity of money - number of times you can use bitcoin in a given amount of time, using it more means you need less bitcoin - that you can divide the bitcoin price (P) by V (velocity) and cut the price by a lot.
But if you don't give bitcoin this price cut by Velocity, then another alt coin switches and becomes that thing.
So, sad to say, better if bitcoin is that backbone, and not some other coin. (For bitcoin holders).

It's a derogatory term that impugns the motives of the developers or promoters of the alternate coins.
Sometimes coins are kind of jokes that get a life of their own, like Dogecoin
Othertimes they seem to be kind of interesting but maybe flawed in assumptions like Quark
And othertimes there are coins like LBRY or Feathercoin, Namecoin, etc, that were kind of popular back in the day but don't seem to be big players now.
New ones like IOTA, Ethereum etc. have to be matched up to past contenders. 
People looking for value appreciation might notice that a lot of coins from a few years back are missing from top 100. Others are there, like Litecoin. 
Buy what you want to, but if you're looking for a coin that's definitely NOT a scam, the current bitcoin is great. The others are all, well they have dev teams, marketing and fancy websites, but those aren't good features.
It's hard to beat bitcoin's immaculate conception and it's actually a good thing that it's a community project with no Satoshi around to beat up.

To be fair, I should have said a government that was a lot less powerful, less able to tell people what to do.
There's a lot of things governments can get away with, because if private corporations tried it, it would clearly be infringing people's rights and/or be very unfair (like eminent domain). But if we addressed the unfairness - like forcing something like good market rates on commercial properties, and higher multiples of value on privately held homes (and not the surrounding property so much), then a private corporation could eminent domain as fairly as the government could.
It takes an expansion of the mind a little bit I think for some people to imagine a government that does less, controls less, owns less. Example - in Greece they had the government owning horse racetracks. Maybe in other countries they own a Lottery and use it to pay taxes etc. But just like racetracks can be privatized, so can other things. But with governments there's a lot of taxing / enforcing / emprisoning power, that cloaks itself in patriotism and nationalism, but is really crypto-fascism (secretly fascist), undemocratic, and loaded with patronage and goodies for those in power and their friends.

:( I'm just worried that random guides on the Internet could make people lose funds to scammers.
Anyone know a reputable guide to getting through this problem? eg something posted at bitcoin.org or lopp.net etc?
BTC has forks now with BCH, BSV, and probably 50 others (bitcoin diamond? bitcoin gold? etc)
Maybe this is important for at least the BTC/BCH pair and maybe the BTC/BSV pair, but situations like this are EXACTLY why I think forked coins aren't really something you've actually  "received" since you have to take risks in order to claim them. 
Like if someone threw foreign coins into my yard, along with landmines.

Basically like asking, how much do users want to pay for priority over each other. The block sizes are limited. How many people MUST send bitcoin basically urgently, within an hour, 99.99% definitely today, sometime today, today or tomorrow, etc.
With fees they compete for space in limited blocks. Eventually when big banks and governments are using bitcoin, they'll probably pay enough to get things accomplished same day. Boy howdy that might be expensive.
I personally think that fees will always be something like at least 1/100th of a percent of the bitcoin price for an ordinary transaction (you pay per byte actually - so its based on the size of the message, not the amounts inside.). 
So like right now ,haven't even looked but I'm assuming the fees work out to about $1. 
 
Oh yeah, its about 64 cents.

There's basically 4 curves to bitcoin that pundits pick on. Basically they start out with the idea, a priori, that they don't like bitcoin. Next, look at the price charts, and find what's wrong:
1) going up - unsustainable bubble
2) going down - dead again
3) flat - no ROI
4) choppy - too volatile
What they fail to see is the rocket upwards and the choppiness and the long low periods that shake out weak hands all work together.

Well a slightly better answer to Mr Wonderful - when he asked (paraphrasing) "I've got a cryptocrap wallet from a Harvard meetup, had $100 in different coins, and these others like Ethereum, XRP (ripple), BCH (bitcoin cash)" are now down to around $30. This is not working why is bitcoin...." (and Pomp answers pro-bitcoin).
This was a chance to explain how we think money first came about (no one there recorded what happened, it is assumed to be spontaneous). So this is a Fable or Fairy Table - Once upon a time, people used other things as money, but eventually there is one good that people choose to use. Pretend each of us had some trade goods - salt, fish, lumber, gold, platinum, rubies, furs, pottery, seashells, marker stones (like Rai stones), glass beads, ... and we are trading in a barter system or a gift system and are tracking social value/debt or honor or value whatever you want to think of it as.
The theory (was it Hayek?) is that eventually what becomes money arises naturally from this situation as one of those trade goods is the best good to have. That can be something like glass beads or seashells (wampum) for a long time, but around the world different civilizations ran into gold and silver coins and those found more or less universal acceptance.
Later systems added fiat to this.
What this means for crypto, is that money is a winner takes all game. The best money is what everyone will use as money. Some might make a better "currency" for now, like say Dash (with huge effort on their part), but that's not going to hold value vs bitcoin.
And Ethereum can be good at what it is - distributed computer - and within reason, as long as it has some value to help give a price signal and keep it secure, that's helpful, but it's not going to be money like bitcoin. (The "flippening" was its closest chance, now it will probably hit a long decline).

The person who has the BTC address has a private key to that address that can probably unlock the BCH.
BUT - they are now risking their BTC balance if they try to go claim the BCH for you.
You're essentially asking them to do something special for a second. Send their BTC balance to a new and safe address.
Then take the old private keys for their old BTC address, and use those keys to get the BCH that are there. THEN send you that BCH back.
It's kind of a hassle, and I blame Roger Ver.  I thought they had a new key format.
BUT anyway, I think the subreddit might know an elegant fix, since it's probably a common problem?

Well anyway, wish here that society in general could figure out how to protect journalists and the critical need society has to have people do reporting, in general. Seems like times have changed and instead of being Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, NBC, CBS, there are many many many more outlets for journalism nowadays.

Bitcoin wont replace fiat currencies only because governments will tax and print in fiat until the whole thing collapses. Or it might not collapse, that's fine too. If it does collapse, bitcoin is there. If it just struggles along, badly, printing money as it goes, breaking promises to citizens, increasing taxes, decreasing services, poaching funds, private profit and public losses - then bitcoin will gain in strength as they fail. An example of the bullcrap you will see is various state governments not fully funding their pensions. States and cities. Huge shortfalls leading to: massive service cuts - or broken promises - or highly raised taxes - and flight from the collapse by the earners with choices. The governments in general are stuck.
Ironically, the best way for bitcoin to fail, is for these groups to not break their promises (pensions etc), keep services accountable, stop stealing from the public, increase public confidence, stop fixing broken businesses, keep workers up with training - and have jobs come to the people where they live somehow (not sure how that would happen), and somehow have everyone magically keep up with every new wave of disruptive tech that eliminates their jobs. Uh .... how?? Half this is possible, but it would take \*amazing\* statecraft. Very very unlikely for more than a third of it to go well.

The mining part with sha256 explained lower down is fine. 
The prime number p and q part is that you make a private key out of these primes on an elliptic curve. It looks like the side of a puzzle piece and a line goes through. Its selected so that the number that results is hard to work backwards to get.
The private key is used to make a public key. A human readable set of letters and numbers encodes these keys for easy typing. In early days private keys began with a 5 and the public key began with a 1.
An interesting and cool strangeness of bitcoin is that the funds are not whole values like a 20 dollar bill a 10 dollar bill etc. Instead they can be whole numbers or fractions in a transaction.
Another interesting thing is the transactions that miners are mining are actually little digitally signed programs. They are usually very small like take from here and pay to there.

I used to think that banks would get super involved with technology like SSL/TLS and become notaries and sign SSL certs etc etc.
But that never happened, so same way, I think banks won't really get much involved in bitcoin.  To them, bitcoin solves a problem that they use SWIFT to solve - inter bank settlement. 
They wouldn't tend to see the need until it's too late to matter.
In the meantime, they'll simply mix customer accounts with their investment accounts and invest in risky shit and then implode and get either taxpayer bailouts, or member haircuts, or not fail and make large profits they can keep for themselves.
They're basically just parasites, and banking should be about 1/10th what it is now, but they're off making money and being relevant to the powers of the world (by being tools).

Holding coin is a speculation, and it's rational to do it if the Market thinks it's a really risky speculation and you get a discount on the price for the risk.
Anyway, time will tell, and I think that holding something volatile where you get a nice possiblity for some upside can still make sense as something to have.
In the meta, if you think people should be farmers, or whatever, then pay them. Or compensate them anyway for the results. If the profit is there, they'll make food.
If you think that they should make food because you're hungry, then I would say that in the meta, SOCIETY should try to organize that outcome, but that isn't on a free farmer out of the goodness of their heart to make food. They might want to take a vacation instead, they deserve a fulfilling life too. 
So, if having enough food for everyone is a goal, the best way to do that is to make it a free choice and anyone could be a farmer if they know how, have a good business plan, and put in the work. Then they should get the rewards, and the rest of us get some food.
We could make our own food it's just really expensive in time and effort for everyone to be their own farmer.
If you have sound money at the base of the economic transactions between people, then there's less market distortions, the ship rights itself, and there's plenty for all. It's just basic Capitalism.

Did Paxful generate the address to send bitcoin to? If so, they have the private key to the BCH address.
But if it's the person themselves who made the destination address for BTC, then they have that addresses BTC private key. It would also be usable maybe as the BCH private key at that address, they just might not have realized that. Then they would have to make a judgement call about how to not get scammed. 
If they've never received any bitcoin at that address ever, it's a one-timer just for you, hmm. What an odd situation.

I agree, not only do most people either buy then sell at 20x,
They also: try to lend the bitcoin, because hey it's just sitting there - then get scammed
They try trading, and get margin called (short or long!)
They leave their coins on exchanges and get exit scammed
They suffer hard drive failure, lose their keys in other sad ways (fire, flood, etc)
Diversify into alts and lose value (sometimes they make 100x on an alt, other times they make .1x - 90% losses)
So it's harder than it looks, I think most people fall short when they try to lend bitcoin, or try to get more, and have too much on exchanges.

So the best critique I saw on that line of thinking was that bitcoin was a "natural Ponzi", in the sense that if you buy early, you are paid by late-comers. (But by that reasoning, so is stock, real estate, in that one person sells it to another later).  I think it was a "World Bank" report.
Any speculative bubble is a natural Ponzi though, like our current stock market, regional real estate markets in global gateway cities, etc.
I personally don't think bitcoin is a Ponzi, natural or otherwise. I think it's just a new asset class and a good competitor compared to dollars as a store of value.
I wouldn't have thought that real estate would be such a good store of value, but people kind of conspire to make their real estate have at least the mirage of rising value. (Mostly by limiting the ability of people to purchase and build, get permits etc, a very political process).
And I would have thought the stock market would be a good store of value, but it depends on honesty, I think the US stock market is okay, but I think the Chinese one is a mirage.

Tether is not a crypto, it's just a token to move fiat around and keep banks from interfering.
Same as Ripple. Ripples not a true crypto. It's a token by a company, it's not a share of the company. It exists to move fiat around. Ripple's arguably more of a scam than Tether.
Tether is also very shady. But just buy Tether with fiat, trade Tether for bitcoin, get your bitcoin off exchanges, finis..

I guess random commenters count as part of this subreddit, but he doesn't seem to be into bitcoin. 
I would say I am really into bitcoin and if there's going to be government, then good government (thinking - Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, maybe Estonia, etc):
The most charitable interpretation of his comment is to say something like:
 Venezuela's situation is so bad, that they can't even afford to literally print their currency. You know it's bad when you can't even afford to put numbers on toilet paper and use that as currency. Venezuela is a very good example of what happens when a corrupt system goes haywire and it's no accident that they printed money instead of using a sound monetary system. That is all just parts of the total and abject failure that is socialism. Every single time it's been tried. And people need to stop. A better way forward is sound money, less central control, less government overreach, and if you want a better life for the poor, you could do something with EBT - electronic balance transfer. But obviously that's a form of wealth redistribution from rich to poor that the rich will avoid and that scammers will scam. It is a challenge in capitalism to provide goods and services to those who have no resources to buy them. It's an open question - so far it's yes - as to whether or not a Society or government should be the thing to do that providing. I can live with yes it's the government - just like roads and the army, but I can imagine a different world where we didn't expect government - a massively inefficient system - but democratically controllable - maybe - to be that thing that does this providing or services. But here again, it has failed.

I think the math looks right, but I wouldnt say that the math is the weakness in bitcoin.
I'd say that being able to know that you actually have bitcoin, and not some wierd fork, that's a problem.
Also, people's computer hardware and network security are both terrible.
And people's practices with day to day computers are not good.
And badly coded buggy vulnerable software is all around us, with intelligence agencies all set up with exploits.
And the supply chain for devices, like their BIOS and hardware are all bad. Drivers with keyboard sniffers, software that phones home ... etc
And it's really hard to model all the threats. Crypto works great, but what about beating passwords out of people with a rubber hose?
I think the math on that picture looks right. Combinatorics makes it easy to have more combinations than there are electrons in the universe.
If there's any super deep problems, it's the conjecture that one-way hashing functions really are one-way. Maybe in reality, we just are kidding ourselves. Maybe encryption is bunk and future (or hidden and current) understandings know differently.

Some of it was parody, but I think they were hoping for schadenfreude - eg hoping bitcoin would just crash. Their nickname for bitcoin was "pedo pesos". They are still probably sadly out there, when they could have made 20x their money or more since they knew about bitcoin so early. But they basically talked themselves out of being involved, so that's fine. Maybe they think every investment or speculation is a scam, period. Eg, speculating on real estate value, or stocks, or art. Therefore, bitcoin is evil etc. Whatever. They each have their own individual reasons, be they economic, political, Statism, being way into law-and-order, mainstream economics, etc.

Selling you either never do (see the Neo meme, when it comes time to sell, you won't have to), or after you're about 50 years old, sell 2&amp; a year (since we don't yet live forever). Before 50 years old though, just accumulate. Don't go too crazy. Just use as a new asset class / store of value, time will tell. You can buy stuff with it if you really want to, but only because you think you have too much, or you want to give enthusiastically to some fun project or goal or a neat product like cryptosteel or a Trezor or a fun bitcoin t-shirt.

Well I think the average person doesn't realize how the public/private/secret/pseudonymity in bitcoin works.
It does suck that someone out there is willing to sell out chainanalysis services to authoritarian governments, but if one good person doesn't do it, some more shady person will do it eventually.
So I think that built in privacy like Monero has is much more how cryptocurrencies should work.
In fact, I was kind of surprised at how bitcoin worked and when I first read how Monero worked, I was suprised that bitcoin didn't do it the way they did.
But there were different goals. Bitcoin was more like, how do we keep bankers from printing their own money. But it seems like Monero's question was how do we get actually functional privacy.

That's interesting that they would track it. Maybe they just do it so people can get their numbers from one source and do their own analysis on common metrics.
I wonder if bitcoin is having any noticeable effects on things like local property markets or car sales or anything, maybe the price of electricity locally. Probably not but that would be interesting.
I assume that if bitcoin went up another 10x in price it would start to be a factor in local economies and they'd have to account for its presence.

mmmmm malware could do whatever, but I've been working with the assumption that if you Ctrl-C to clipboard something that looks like a bitcoin address, it's ready to paste it's own address when you Ctrl-V
What you should see when you sign a transaction is your real address, and when it tries to send to the bad one, it fails. It really should help a lot, but if it's given a bad address to START with, it will sign whatever you approve. If you give the hardware the true address, it will sign a transaction correctly to just that one.
But, if the malware sees bitcoin addresses in your browser, and starts to overwrite those with it's own addresses, hmm would you notice.

Well whatever, the flippening was quite a crazy event. People who were into ETH a year before the flippening were probably up 1000%.

As for selling, I am of two minds - one of them is sell 1 or 3% a year. Another is to sell whenever its nuts level overvalued on the rainbow charts.
Bitcoin has enough shady exchanges etc, that if you haven't read it, there's a real true to life story called REMINISCENCES OF A STOCK OPERATOR by Edwin LeFevre - 
It's long but interesting, I think as I recall it's about trading in a bucket shop back in 1915-ish in USA. People would watch the tickers and later on he gets good at painting the tape and luring in speculators etc. He had an interesting thing going on. I think if you're interested in bitcoin's price - and how it's traded on basically unregulated markets, you would find that guys story interesting.
I still think bitcoin is worth buying but I would say you need a 2+ year time horizon and don't go nuts.

\&gt;  If decentralization was so great, how come we basically have 4 companies doing all card processing? 
Decentralization is still a great thing, even if there are a few centralized groups. Decentralization of finance means that financial censorship is harder to pull off. I know it's hard to see, but when people used cash or gold face-to-face, it was harder to interfere in their finances. 
Once money became electronic and notional (around the age of the telegraph, maybe earlier - like back to Scotland and bank notes etc) then it became possible for the modern nation State to control finance, put the entire financial life of their nations up on the block, finance vast world wars, etc. 
It was really not a good thing that they could abuse the financial system and the people stuck in it.

You can passively just wear a bitcoin button or something and if people ask, be cool. Basically share the idea that trading with you using bitcoin is a possibility. It doesn't matter much what anyone does. As long as the new users is growing linearly, the value of the network goes up exponentially, and adoption will happen. The new user growth just has to be faster than the birth rate - death rate etc.
It's how any network effect spreads, like learning and speaking Italian, having a fax machine, having an email address, etc.

Yeah with a mandated govcrypto, you have whatever flaws the system imposes on you has. That's not a crypto problem per se, you could always barter. Ultimately, if the govt removes cash, it doesn't have to be crypto. Then you're in the situation above.
Crpto could be better, I'm a fan of Monero except for the mining schedule and frackas that resists ASICs, but - one thing I would like to see is a crypto system where I am blind to where the funds came from, the source address. Just that funds went in, and funds went out of a block, but knowing which incoming funds (or even direction, in vs out) except in a total summary sense --- well anyway just want to make it so that even if thugs capture me, that they cant use the records that the blockchain has, nor my wallet has, to know anything except which block might have given me some of my funds.

The IMF is basically giving you loans that result in that; one group of kleptocrats or demagogues take the loans to cover a previous group of kleptocrats and autocrats. The public has to pay the loans back with austerity or default.
It's basically slavery with extra steps.
Like imagine if you elected banksters. They would get the public to take on debt burdends that are unsustainable. Then when you fail to pay them, they raise your taxes or cut your services etc. THe end game is that the public pays them a steady feed of money and power.
The public can't NOT pay their taxes without jail and confiscation etc. And they can't elect anyone but those that promise them free stuff and who war monger and suck the life right out of you with taxes to pay for it all - or who dont' and use defecits - which are just taxes you have to pay later (or give the banksters free money and power).
Basically they use democracy, government programs, taxes, and spending, and defecits - against you for their own enrichment.

The big problem here is involving a business account could make you into a money services business and in a lot of US states they each have their own rules. Wyoming the least but seems like NY has the most. 
Next in the US a lot of banks are privately owned but act as enforcers of US financial rules and the US does not have a tradition of banking secrecy - just the opposite - the US govt feels (or is) extremely entitled to know and interfere with the private financial life of its citizens
Part of this is the history of catching Al Capone with tax evasion, seizing privately owned gold in the 1930s, and even today taxing US citizens resident and operating economically overseas ( I think only the US and Liberia do that )
So given that in the US they make boogeymen out of bitcoiners the System is very likely to put a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) out on large deposits from nowhere and close your accounts

Well unfortunately, this is another example of Lion vs Zebra in life.
I'll explain the allegory / metaphor:  
Lions chase and eat Zebras.
Lions do not hunt Whales, and Lions do not hunt Mice.  
Lions chase down a food of the appropriate size and environment. They are not equipped to waste time on small prey, and they cant really leave a certain defined environment and go after bigger game.
They can only deal with things approximately the size they can handle. 
What this means is if you have single-digit or double-digit bitcoin holdings, and you still have your day job (eg not rich), this is aimed squarely at YOU.
If you are very small fry, or as big as Brian Armstrong of Coinbase (who I think historically had about 50k bitcoin) - you are either too small for the effort (you will just have to bend over and pay taxes and penalties of $40), or way too big and lawyered up to take on (and you will pay &gt; $1m for your defense and easily beat the IRS).

Yeah you could use the bitcoin blockchain to create value out of something that would otherwise be lost.
And yes, you could use a blockchain as a way to make a kind of distributed permissionless database to track things. (A distributed notary service, with cryptography and keys) -- so yeah blockchains can do that. 
The usual response is you could just use a centralized database, but ... there's flowcharts you can use to figure out the right kind of database scheme -- if you are somewhat competitors but really fear a cartel of bad actors, but are pretty sure no such cartel yet exists, and if you want a system where its voluntary and companies can come and go, and you want to order messages through time, and commit messages irreversibly basically to a centralized database, but decentralize the copies to everyone, blah blah, then yes a blockchain is absolutely the right fit for that kind of problem ;)

Number of Coinbase users I think is around 13 million last December. [
And some kind of poll about wallets to store bitcoin, they did pretty well ... [
And then there's going to be the issue that they aren't the whole bitcoin market.
Maybe there is ballpark 50 million bitcoin users, world wide? That's would have been my first guess, but now I think it's lower than that.
Another guy took a swat at the problem and thinks it's around 20 million. Check out his logic: [
For me the key takeaway is " 28.5 million bitcoin wallets that hold more than 0.001 BTC "
So, I know that a lot of bitcoiners are going to have multiple addresses, which splits it out. And a lot of people think they have bitcoin but really have IOUs on exchanges. And exchanges might concentrate the wallets again downwards.
Not sure, maybe his guestimate of 20 million users is right (I think it's kind of low). Does that seem low or high to you? To me that seems right now still look like early days.

For those who are wondering why this relates to bitcoin:
" J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. ... Along with Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Chase received $25 billion on October 28, 2008 as one of four of the original nine U.S. banks to receive money from the Treasury under its Capital Purchase Program. "
And as to why we need banks, what is going on is they DO provide some benefit to Society. But banks take for themselves, and they will push harder and harder until generally most people are neutral either way to the existence of private banks like these. 
What they do is - as long as there are profits, that goes to shareholders or owners. But if there are losses - then that becomes a bailout covered by taxpayers or by haircuts or bail-ins which are slightly better (but still abusive if they are done like they were in Cyprus)
Bitcoin exists because of their abuse of the system.
Further, if they manipulate this benchmark, it's because they can adjust the perception of market players about the value of dollars now and into the future. They can do that manipulation because they are so central and because the supply of dollars is so fuzzy and controlled by the Federal Reserve (another quasi-government entity).
Anyway, it all sucks and this fine is tiny, and fines this small are basically operating expenses to a big bank.

I'm only speaking for me, but I'm into a modification of Georgism, and about a 100 year changeover to it.
It essentially just taxes real estate and not anything else. You could make a small limited exception for a family home. You could try to subsidized farms or something.
But mainly it's simple and pretty unavoidable. I wouldn't have special tax assessors, just a system where you pay the taxes you want to, and if someone pays more than some number like more than double your taxes, for long enough, then they have to buy you rplace out at like 25x what you paid in taxes. So ... if you don't want a to pay a lot in taxes, then don't. But someone else might buy you out. Then there'd be less scams about assessments. Pay what you think the Market is worth.
I don't have to know who is paying either.
Land can't run away, if someone doesn't pay taxes, it becomes publicly owned.  L

Yes it would probably be a big help. Ideally you could buy about 3, but if you can afford .5 that's not insignificant. If you have everything else in your life squared away - like got a college degree, a decent job, saved for a house, got some tucked away in the stock market, then have a little extra savings? Then I think .5 bitcoin makes sense.
Even though bitcoin returns might be really big - they can also go to zero - ZERO;
You can get good returns on investing in yourself and making sure you have some foundational things in place, eg double check and and/or but if those things are square you're good to go.
Mostly I'd say only put in what you could afford to lose. If you can't afford to lose it, it's too much in.
Enough to be interested, but not so much you lose sleep over it.
EDIT: just a gut feel, but it feels like right now, 1 bitcoin now is like once upon a time having about around 200 bitcoins on Mt Gox back in the day.  So most important thing is to GET YOUR COIN OFF EXCHANGES after you buy.

No, an illegal mining farm is just going to be a mining farm where they're not paying for electricity, or are paying bribes to get electricity (probably more common), or where the arrangement is off the books and both the electrical generators and the miners are in cahoots.
Usually you're going to see things like this in places where electrical power is subsidized. Some places in this world think that if they produce lots of excess electrical power, that that will magically make people richer. Eg, I think the country of Georgia is like that. China does the same, they have hydro plants in the middle of nowhere. No real customers for the power.
If you don't subsidize electrical power, then it costs whatever it costs to make it, and you resell it. If you have a decent ultra high voltage (UHV) grid to move the power around, then you can have competitive pricing and the price should be appx whatever it costs to produce it (subject to manipulations like PG&amp;E did in California). If the prices for power are very near the costs, then they are going to NOTICE if someone isn't paying.
If someone is stealing the electrical power, then that's when authorities might get called in.
Lots of things can use electrical power, but cryptocurrency mining tends to make the powers that be a little more unhappy because it takes electrical power subsidies and arbitrages that into something they can't control - like bitcoin. 
If these miners were smelting aluminum and making jobs and a tax base, the authorities would probably be less into swooping in and more into collecting that revenue.
The basic way to know if the electricity is actually subsidized is whether or not the electric plants are State-owned.

Somewhat, in that you have a device - maybe a webpage - saying "hey send bitcoin here" - and there is no trusted path coming from your computer that a hacker couldn't intercept.
Yes anyway, agreeing with you. This malware is rewriting the address as you paste it, but there's no reason some other malware couldn't rewrite the address to send to that it shows you on your web browser, etc.
So at some point, you do need very trustworthy hardware. The problem there is that there's always some group that is super good at subverting your supply chain. I think the Chromebook is a good choice, but then Google is inside the castle walls. Another good choice is a Mac, but then Apple is inside. With Windows, Microsoft. With many linuxes, whoever is in charge of that distro or can sneak in.
Some groups are working on secure BIOS, and others are working on whole stack alteratives to things like IOS and Android.

I'll have to have a tax guy look at it.
I don't like the guidance. I wish they had taxed when you sold the coins or when you traded them for other coins.
The main reason I dont like the guidance is that forked coins are a landmine. It's like if people throw shit in your yard, like car parts or landmines, and now - it's on me to figure out what they've done and sell or keep them? I never asked for them to toss this shit at me and now it's my problem??
It's like, if some guy crashes a jet on your land and now, you're the "owner"? And since their dumb fighter jet is supposedly worth some money, I have to deal with the wreckage? Seems stupid.
Bad guidance. Would have been better if they said nothing.
Or maybe better example - me, happily farming on 100 acres of land. One day somebody, not me, does some math and finds oil under my land. If I try to mine it, I could get rich, or I could have a massive superfund of cleanup problems. Now the IRS wants it counted as if it's already extracted.

The market is see-sawing between two ideas:
How high can this go? (how long can I put off selling, or how quickly can I buy?)
and how low can this go? (how fast can I sell, or how long can I wait to buy?)
That's why you have big extreme lows and highs, that's the market feeling that out. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy once it gets momentum one way or the other. As it's falling it trends down down down but not predictably. Then reverses quite suddenly and goes up and up and up. It's actually normal for anything you could speculate on to do this, and in bitcoin the moves are bigger and faster because all the dampeners other markets have aren't there in bitcoin. That's part of the story anyway.

Yes that sounds pretty terrible, like the exchange is socializing the losses by giving all accounts (well, loans) a haircut to make up for their fuckup.
Partly better would be to give you an exchange coin to redeem at a discount (like something awful) but which the exchange itself would buy back over time. (But also let you trade it with each other). Then the exchange could pay off it's debt to you for it's fuckup. (Isn't that what Binance token was? or maybe Bitfinex?)

You get a read-only DVD, and you read the blocks off. They have proof of work, they are either correct or they aren't. Then you have checkpoints in your bitcoin node software at least historically. Eventually the DVD runs out of blocks, you start downloading the actual blockchain from the network. It should point back to the same blockchain you downloaded from DVD. If you don't believe it, go a few hundred blocks back, or only as far as your last checkpoint in your node software. Then continue as normal. Nothing to trust here. Most valid Proof of Work is the longest chain (subject to whatever rules you think apply, or else you or them are on a fork)

If 80% of the miners and nodes went out and made a new thing, called it bitcoin, and broke this, they can go stew in their own sick juice, because it's not actually bitcoin.
The real bitcoin is the one with the limited supply, and market forces (aka price) would quickly make them realize their 80% fork stinks, and they have deluded themselves.

Not your keys not your bitcoin. So you would be totally screwed on everything but the hardwallet. They just seize the funds, prevent withdrawls, etc. "Not your keys not your bitcoin."
If the hardwallet + it's addresses are tied to you, you are still screwed. "The dollar is backed by proof of violence."
You'd have to have some way of saying "nope, I have no bitcoin, all gone" and have that actually be plausible.
Then you'd have to figure out a way to leave the country to somewhere friendly to you.
Then you could recover your bitcoin with the seed words or similar, and move on with life.
The US Government had that executive order in 1933 that seized gold right out of safe deposits, and could seize it if you tried to sell it at a shop etc. They also had Prohibition and tried that for a while. The rest of the world did whatever. The US Govt can go insane sometimes and you're just an individual. You do have rights, but they can be trampled.

Seems like he was a good communicator, people love his newsletters to investors.  Has folksy shareholder meetings.
He had a nice setup to allow people to sell their businesses to him yet keep running them (like a reverse mortgage is to a house with retirees in it, a way for them to live there but sell out).
He got an insurance company, wasn't it GEICO, and that wound up helping fund the acquisition of other businesses.
Made a big conglomeration of businesses.
I think he practically took over somewhere like Tulsa Oklahoma, but stayed away from New York, so probably his lifestyle never took a hit.
I think he also kept his old Ford truck, at least puts on airs of being humble.
Has tried to figure out value companies, like is it beat down for no good reason, can it have a comeback? I think he has hits and misses there.
Has some good skepticism about the stock market, I think personally Bogle was better (just get an index fund).
And last but not least, knows basically jack shit about bitcoin and his opinions on it are poop - you should do the opposite and should buy a reasonable amount whatever you can put in and not miss out.
Get your coins off the exchanges tho and into a wallet you control, the usual not your keys not your bitcoin. But it's an important last step.

You should separate those problems out.
1. tracking the value of your coins in dollars
2. another issue is storing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies either in a hot wallet (small amounts for payments) on something like a phone
3. and storing coin balances in cold storage on secure hardware or other ways.
1. Tracking fiat value of your coin balances
WARNING: be very wary of crypto apps on your phone, eventually you are going to get malware doing this.
a)  tracking value, you can find sites where you can give them an address and they'll check a blockchain and look at a value
b) CoinTrackr
c) Coinmarketcap App  (CMC) go to [coinmarketcap.com]( and be extremely careful about what app you put onto your android or whatever
d) make your own with a spreadsheet and CMC website
2) hot wallets
a) I used to use Mycelium - but I haven't used a hot wallet in years. I don't trust my phone with coins. I would use an Android simulator like Bluestacks if I wanted to do that though.
EDIT: for the love of G-d do not use a web wallet
3) cold wallets / cold storage
a) hardware like Ledger or Trezor bought straight from the manufacturer. Watch out for Amazon - they mix goods together and send you one from whoever. Those could be Trojaned, or have a setup with a prefilled set of seed values for 'convenience' (theft). Just buy direct from manufacturer do not take shortcuts. Read up and learn.
b) cold storage - keep the key to your wallet on a piece of paper that never touches a computer, handwritten, or tap it into a piece of steel

Are there some error messages he could read that could say something like: "hey, you seem to have closed your LN - power failure? network outage? frozen in ice? - and because of that, all of your channel partners forced closed things because you weren't responsive. You now need to go talk to A, B, C, D, your channel partners and ask for some balance of funds back?

Yes I think what it is is you have this genius, Wolfram, who has this longstanding tool for mathematical analysis, and he's using it interactively.
This tool has been given some expansive functions to help it present data from bitcoin and Ethereum, and the fun part is watching him work with janky bitcoin blockchain ideas and try to present them
Example - there's a step near the beginning where he has to make a bitcoin public/private keypair. I think he expected that when you generate a keypair, you would get two keys out (but technically you only need one, the private key). So ... they probably should have unpacked that a bit more and said, here's all this crypto, once you are done, you have a private key. If you need a public key, you put in your private key and you get a public key out. Etc.
Well its fun to watch Wolfram tip tap through his powerful tool (using computers the way I always dreamed a computer should be used, tbh, so now I need to go look into this tool and how people use it) - and him using it to explore ideas like - how many blocks are there? (currently at block 56 at the time), ah okay, then taking once every 50000 blocks how many transactions per block? ah (looks smoothly upwards), then how about every 10000 blocks (the curve is very spiky now with extreme highs and lows), ahhh, hmmm and then seeing him do more with it. It's funny because bitcoin (in my opinion) is SUPER JANK and clearly the work of a brilliant person who was a somewhat average coder, but with an incredible imagination, and ... it works! It's like so unbeleivably janky, and to see someone who is deeply into mathematics and computing take a look at it, it's great :)
It's like seeing the inner mind of a vulcan trapped on a planet, like in classic Star Trek, with Kirk vs the Gorns, who could make laser weapons take a first look at like a black powder musket and is all like 'ah, chemical energy, propels a lead ball, down a tube, and the gases ... leak all over the place don't they! ... and this lead ball yes that would hurt, but the ball itself, it does not move at light speed, what is its speed over various distances, ah curious, and the ball spins in flight, but ... by accident, so ... hmm'

There's no reason a bitcoin can't be any made up dollar number you want, except the relationship between supply and demand (of bitcoins, of dollars, for bitcoins and for dollars), electricity costs, miner costs, etc.
Like here look, in 15 halvings I think 1 bitcoin will be $252352523542542525234525252525252 dollars.
Did the dollar supply increase? Did the bitcoin supply decrease? Anything could happen to make up any future number.
I'm not trying to be flip, but bitcoins and what the future mined supply will be is basically 99.99999999% certain. The future supply of dollars is not certain at all. The future costs are also whatever. And I'm sure that what you mean that in a unit of account sense, are people REALLY not going to spend bitcoin that they might have 1 to 100 of, if 1 bitcoin alone could buy a whole countrie's worth of assets?? I know it seems absurd, but anything could happen.
And I forgot to mention the obvious, but there is a difference between the mined supply and the market supply. In that, we know basically 100% for sure how much bitcoin will be mined. We don't know for sure how much will be available for sale on the open market. It might be dumped by long time holders, or it might be even more scarce. The notional dollar value is a mirage. What is real is bitcoin. So eventually that might turn bitcoin - into the unit of account - since it will be the steady and unchanging thing, and not the inflating dollar value.
I know that sounds weird.

Stocks should be a decent investment. Think of bitcoin as insurance against total financial irresponsibility. You could then use bitcoin to buy stocks, or sell stock to buy bitcoin.
The price of stocks could potentially come back down to earth but there are still a lot of "meme" "growth" (Greater Fool) stocks out there that have valuations that are kind of nutty. 
If the system changed radically, and made it so that stocks HAD to give a dividend, and that selling stock (Capital gains) was taxed super high, like 80%, then stock prices would be a lot closer to their "value". As it is, the current system is about coming up with juicy ideas and pawning them off onto a Greater Fool.
Anyway, fat chance of that changing, but bitcoin is a nice hedge against dollar / fiat insanity.

Later if the amount that moves from that address is the original balance and not the balance+dust, I have learned something about that addresses wallet system, maybe identifying someone. How do they use dust, oldest first? newest first? Not at all? some other clever process?
Also, these groups could be vendors on darknet markers selling something harmless but has utility, like ziploc bags, and seeing your purchases get tied to other things by what you buy from them and how and if you include dust, etc. 
It would be way better for bitcoin if balances were more of an unknown. Provably under a total, but not so easily visualized.

EDIT 2: the negative rates are if you want to park it overnight at the Central Bank. Since they won't want to lose money, the banks will turn it into cash and store it in vaults. To stop that, the Central Banks will ban cash. To thwart that, the banks will probably invest in things that track inflation, like just go whatever version of S&amp;P500 they can use to index the markets. Banks being "invested" (passively) as shareholders in index funds of domestic markets will probably be allowed. I wonder if they would draw the line at private equity (a no no? But they will probably cave and allow it).  Bank of Japan I think ... owns 75% of the value of Japanese companies. Don't quote me on that exact number, but to call their involvement in propping up their domestic stockmarket HUGE would be an understatement. They basically own shares of Japanese companies that they can never ever sell. (They need to be able to "destroy" the shares for this to "work" - like bitcoin's Proof of Burn, but I shouldn't be giving them ideas.)  This is why Japan has had 30 fucking years of malaise. An extremely risk averse society, and extremely poor returns on bank deposits, and a culture that just does not accept failure and move on.
Yeah they think it results in stimulus. What is really happening is that the helicopters of cash go first to their friends, who can buy things before the rising prices follow. It works until it doesn't. It's the Cantillon Effect.
Just like how I, could (probably should) go buy a second house and enjoy the rising house market price. (I wouldn't want a house, but that's the idea.) Other people out there are buying things with fiat, using OPM (other people's money) to get real assets, and they've been getting that money a lot faster than middle class people.
And middle class people get that lended money much faster than poor people. 
These things further push wealth up to the oligarchy, but people don't revolt because they have food and a job.
EDIT: QE delays the reckoning by pushing off into the future, the inevitable wrap up and shut down of unprofitable activities. Closing businesses means people lose their jobs, can't pay their bills, and the country suffers. But we also suffer if we never have bad businesses close. They need to close in order for there to be a turnover from those who don't know how to be profitable or who have had their businesses disrupted by technology and change and competition - those have to go away and have their assets reused to make new better businesses. Then our standards of living can rise. People will have good jobs. Let's have a real social safety net so that Labor doesn't worry so much about the drama of businesses coming and going. It's a good thing for bad business to get wound up. Like having Sears fold, it's painful, but it had to happen. Or having Blockbuster wind up - it had to happen - the new tech was more disruptive than they thought it would be. Or having Theranos, which turned out to be fraudulent, that had to en
Bitcoin can and will help, because once we have sound money under the system, only things that are good ideas are going to get lasting funding. The pain of losing one's job is not as bad as 20 years of "Lost Decade" to come for USA.

Heh I have to find the video of it somewhere but here's the sketch
(A small board meeting. An accountant stands up and reads...)
Accountant (Michael Palin): Lady Chairman, sir, shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars, plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds, this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling.
Chairman (Graham Chapman): A shilling Wilkins?
Accountant: Er, roughly, yes sir.
Chairman: Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi-million pound corporation and you are a very new chartered accountant. Isn't it possible there may have been some mistake?
Accountant: Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.
Board Member (John Cleese): Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net or gross?
Accountant: It's British sir.
Chairman: Yes, has tax been paid on it?
Accountant: Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.
Board Member: Five pence of a further sixpence?
Accountant: (eagerly) Yes sir.
Chairman: Five pence of a further sixpence?
Accountant: That's right sir.
Chairman: Then where is the other penny?
Accountant: Er...
Board Member: That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where is it?
Accountant: Erm...
Chairman: Wilkins?
Accountant: (in tears) I embezzled it sir.
Chairman: What all of it?
Accountant: Yes all of it.
Board Member: You naughty person.
Accountant: It's my first. Please be gentle with me.
Chairman: I'm afraid it's my unpleasant duty to inform you that you're fired.
Accountant: Oh please, please.
Chairman: No, out!
Accountant: (crying) Oh... (he leaves)
Chairman: Yes, there's no place for sentiment in big business.
(He goes over to a wall plaque 'There is no place for sentiment in Big Business'. He turns it over. On the back it says 'He's right you know'.)
Bishop (Terry Jones): (to Chairman) Oh you're no fun anymore.
(Camel Spotting man comes running in shouting.)
Spotter (Eric Idle): I heard that. Who said that?
All: (pointing at the bishop) He did! He did!
Bishop: No I didn't.
All: Ooh!
Spotter: Right!
(Shot of the bishop bound and gagged and tied across a railway line.)
Voice Over (Eric Idle): Here is the address to complain to...
(Caption on screen : 'MR ALBERT SPIM, I,OOO,OO8 LONDON ROAD, OXFORD' But he reads:)
Voice Over: The Royal Frog Trampling Institute, 16 Rayners Lane, London, W.C. Fields. I'll just repeat that...
(Caption on screen : 'FLIGHT LT. &amp; PREBENDARY ETHEL MORRIS, THE DIMPLES, THAXTED, NR BUENOS AIRES' He reads over it:)

Hong Kong should just switch over to a fractional gold standard, start with a partial reserve, like 1% and just announce that they will ramp it up or down. And symbolically also offer another rate on cryptocurrency, also fractional reserve, could be 1/100% or 1/1000% of a percent. Only symbolic, but would be interesting.
Example, 1 bitcoin = \~8500 USD = 56000 HKD?
Or 1 oz gold (\~31 grams of gold) = \~10k HKD, so fractional reserve that and offer to buy gold, like 31 grams of gold = 100 HKD, or sell gold at 100x markup. Again, symbolic, but the point is to get a window started.
Raise those percentages until there are takers and keep the number of takers modest. Preserve your currency independence. Only trade physical gold actually at a physical window or bank branches.

Meh, Venezuela is a mess because the government doesn't care who it starves or how much of the economy they kill off.
Fracking and abundant natural gas is leading to a decline in the need for crude oil, and Venezuela has really heavy tar stuff, although a lot of it. 
In the meantime, they don't have a lot of natural refining capacity..
The nearest capacity is in the USA I think in Louisiana.
The markets there are open, but in general the price for oil based energy is way down, and this is affecting all countries that have economies that are oil dependent.
Last, the place is a kleptocracy and has put the military in charge of any seized assets like factories and oil pumps etc. 
The govt sets the price for basic goods like oil, flour (to make arepas), and gasoline (refined) is extremely cheap.
They think they should have refined gasoline for super cheap because they export a heavy form of raw oil. But refined gasoline requires work and refineries. It's not something you should just expect to have laying around, if you actually have no refineries making to supply it.
Basically everyone but the regime is miserable there, and the problems would go away pretty quickly if they just had ordinary food and medical aid for the poor, and have normal regulated capitalism and markets.
But they want to emulate Cuba (which isn't an awful place, just kind of a shadow of what it could be, understandable that they had their revolution after Batista, and imperialist USA mindset.)
Anyway, Venezuela is exactly why stupid socialism doesn't work. If you have a smarter form of semi-socialism, it could work, but it has to be somewhat connected to reality.

The first few are usually enough to find a unique address that matches.
Technically you need the whole thing. Analogy is like if someone told you the start of the word was 'supercalifrag...' and you only found 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' out there, with 1 match, that's the one.
Even if you found multiple matches, like 3 or 4, maybe only one is on the same night and around the same time. It wouldn't be some old one from 2013 nor 2015, etc.

You could make a channel to each person you want to buy from, the LN doesn't need that. It can route payments. So you just need a nice set of channels to places with good fund capacity. Like having a bank account, but it's optional. You can make thousands of channels, or you could make one or two.

It's spendable. Technically people are always in some ratio of assets - like sum up your assets. You might have a house, car, student loans, credit card debts, cash, and bitcoin. At any given moment one or another of these things has a value attached to it. If bitcoin keeps going up, then yes, by Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good), you will spend your worst money which is cash.
(Quick Gresham's Law definition: In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.)
So when you see something for sale in cash (VISA probably) or bitcoin over the Internet, it doesn't matter which one you use, but what's happening to the ratio of one or the other. People know bitcoin is better.
I would gladly take bitcoin over cash if I was selling things online. I don't even think I'd try to go with VISA. Just sell stuff via OpenBazaar and use bitcoin. But when people are buying, I understand that if they use bitcoin, they are probably just indirectly using cash (rebuying bitcoin with cash). If they spend using bitcoin, what they're really doing is selling bitcoin and changing the ratios of their assets very slightly.

The settlement layer does not need that many transactions committed. You can use LN and go way way up in transaction counts.
Right now that makes it an interesting future, where to use LN you have to put bitcoins essentially into a hot wallet to sign things (maybe there's a sneakernet way to pull this off but I doubt it) - so that's good for bitcoin price as it forces people to stake it. 
But on the other hand LN will multiply the velocity of the money by potentially up to 10,000x or more, so that's bad for bitcoin price.. 
Hmm well we'll see. Bitcoin has to be worth a lot or else you can't run an economy on it. So we'll see how these monetary values balance out. The existing holders of bitcoin would like the use to be widespread and for bitcoin to be valuable, so expect further developments on both fronts.

Well but they could firewall between CLAM and BTC.
They could have just let CLAM sellers on margin eat the losses. They could close accounts on margin very aggressively etc.
Well, fair point, I don't know how they set it up.
But I don't understand why the CLAM trades need to affect other trades.
Maybe I'm just confused because it was a CLAM/BTC trade that fell through, therefore, it also affected market prices for BTC on Poloniex (making CLAM go down and BTC go up?) 
So maybe what happened was all the CLAM sold, which raised the price of BTC on their market, which stopped out / margin called all the people that were short BTC on Poloniex??
Yeah I think you've led me to the answer. It wasn't CLAM vs USD that crashed, it was the CLAM/BTC pair. So if CLAM went down (sold), then BTC went up (bought).  This moved the price of BTC up on Poloniex, which would close out BTC traders that were margin and short (hoping for lower prices). The BTC market moved against them, and they got called on it??
Maybe something messed up like that, I don't know.

I agree that most forks are a pure split after a given block number, but you could do your fork anyway you want, like give yourself all the previous coins. But who would agree to run that, is the point.
Like, we could all just decide that Satoshi doesn't need those coins, and invalidate them, and that would be a fork. Chop off the first million coins. Now the new limit is 20 million coins, and move the Genesis block up.

People disagree on what fiat means because there hasn't been a distinction much made before between:
1. an authority calls their made up numbers money
2. everyone believes the made up numbers are money
3. you must pay taxes in the made up numbers
4. the money is not literally something you can touch, like gold
5. is actually scarce
6. unforgeable, genuine and true vs false
So bitcoin is not proclaimed money by an authority, but it is made up numbers that people treat like money, and you don't have to but could pay your taxes in it - but governements aren't demanding taxes be paid in it, but it's not something you can touch like gold, but bitcoin is scarce like my poop, but it's not scarce in the sense that poop is not scarce, and although true bitcoin is easy to test - the reality is a plague of forks and conmen.
Bitcoin, in my opinion, is not fiat, and is actually a true money like cattle, wampum, glass beads, or gold and silver coins. But I understand differing views on this.

Yep everything is fine and on track.
I am just salty about latecomers and nocoiners and non-miners who want more than the schedule of rewards.
That is exactly what bitcoin is here to stop. Nocoiners have no say over how this works. Latecomers at least aren't shafted by having their money debased. Non-miners don't realize that when the scarcity halves, the price doubles (does the value double? kind of) etc.
This is a whole system that all works together collectively, and it's quite unlike the fiat Ponzi shit we use now.
You're a longtimer in bitcoin so I know you get it, but I am just salty about newbs lately. And traditional economists who think we need an inflationary money supply to keep their broken window fallacy of an economy moving.

Bitcoin is an modern twist and implementation of Austrian economics currency ideas - 
See Nick Szabo's "Shelling out" about money in general. He wrote it before bitcoin existed. Then once you see what money can be (Rai Stones, wampum, glass beads, notes and coins, lumps of gold or silver, cattle, etc.) - then you will see that bitcoin has great properties - but not the same mix of them as things like gold, paper money IOUs, etc. It has new and interesting properties that make it a complementary kind of money.

Chomsky would probably dislike the AnCap Libertarian Chicago-school type thinking of Milton Friedman.
It's not completely without merit to dislike Friedman, remember he helped the US economically rationalize the Chilean dictator Pinochet and the other juntas, that have done a lot of damage to free peoples.
The downside of course is that sometimes the opposite of some local fascist was some communist group supported by the KGB and the Soviet Union. Two wrongs don't make a right, but the Soviet Union was also a dark place.
I think for Chomsky, all this bitcoin stuff would be suspiciously individualistic and anti-collectivist, so he might not like bitcoin and bitcoiners.
Bitcoin is definitely not Marxist, so he'd really not like it.
EDIT: apparently according to Wikipedia, " Noam *Chomsky* describes  himself as a libertarian socialist, a sympathizer of  anarcho-syndicalism, and is considered to be a key intellectual figure  within the left-wing of politics of the United States. "
You know what, he might love bitcoin. A lot of us are libertarians here, and a few of us are libertarian socialists.

Ah that's tough. I've had times, thinking back over my life and how it's gone, where I realize that I had the exact opposite conclusion as other people, and it's turned out that they were right and I was 100% wrong. It's funny sometimes how logic, like an AND, NOT, OR, can get flipped around, and you can 100% believe something that's completely not true, while being logical, but in error. It can blindside you... So far I don't think it's been over anything that completely matters ... oh I remember an example:  Back when CD-ROMS came out, a friend asked me if they use one side or both sides. I could swear I remembered seeing a documentary about how the system worked, and I could swear that the prototype used both sides. But(!) actual music CD-ROMS sold in stores only used one side, and I didn't realize that since I'd never owned one. EDIT: I think I was thinking of Laserdisc (which I also did not own, but I think I got to see one one time, and I think it was double-sided, and I *assumed* that CD-ROMS were also doublesided)

I think that good advice for bitcoin now would be - honestly - get a small part of your portfolio into something super high risk and super high potential payoff. Not lottery tickets, dur. But bitcoin, maybe another crypto that you like personally, and a longshot ICO, and see how it works out for your. This is basic black swan stuff.
That's NOT something a fiduciary should or would advise, obviously. But in this day and age (or like always) people should think for themselves and be excited and take calculated risks - eyes wide open. 
Because, out there in the bond market are the bonds of Venezuela, Argentina, Iraq, Greece, and those stinky bonds are getting gobbled up and that makes no sense.

Your wallet should be able to generate a receiving address, and then you go to your online wallet and send it to your wallet's receiving address. It sends the message to do that to the blockchain.

I disagree, me getting wealthier isn't coming at someone else's expense.
Even if you meant the closed system of tokens where we pretend bitcoin values are money, when I trade them tokens for real world goods, or they trade fiat for my tokens, we are just changing places.
If we do it voluntarily, then like all trade we make each other richer.
Example - it's not rent-seeking for one shareholder to sell their stock to another shareholder. (They could be swapping positions in risk vs return, going from risk-loving to risk-averse) Or for someone with a commodity like pork bellies to sell that for fiat. In that case someone sold something real - actual pork bellies - for something imaginary - dollars. So if we want to swap rare pepes for dogecoin, who the fuck even worries about that.
Anyway, people trading for bitcoin might like it as an odd store of value, a high-risk and non-correlated with stocks kind of asset, and/or just a punt for risk-loving persons. Maybe 1-5% of net worth into bitcoin on the long shot odds.

Tell me about it, the IRS rules are completely unworkable for people that experimented with "Balance bots" - actively trading markets via the API - before the IRS guidance on taxes and treating things like a commodity where you have to track every buy and sell. Some bots are doing a trade a second or faster, and you're going to tell me that the IRS is fucking seriously going to track the taxes on individual trades that are even under a dollar in value? (Even if it might be reasonable to tax them in their entirety, or at the days' end, or month end, or quarter end, or some other more reasonable time frame).
Anyone have any info on how high frequency trading is taxed on Wall Street? They don't tax every single micro transaction do they, seriously????
I'm not going to say more but the spreadsheets you would have to attach to your taxes would reach into the hundreds or thousands of pages of trades, and it would be literally ridiculous for all involved.
That said, give unto Caesar what is Caesar's so I personally just roll my eyes at this IRS stuff and do not advocate tax evasion obviously.
That said, I would LOVE if we could all have financial privacy and no more silly taxes on these trades. Bitcoin should be a currency without taxes on the conversion, or like kind trades between one crypto and another. What a huge pain.

But that's not actual bitcoin, it's ledger entries saying you have some, a kind of IOU. To actually have bitcoin, you have to send it out to a wallet, but that's kind of a small amount.
So you have kind of bought a tiny ticket betting that bitcoin will go up in value. So like Boredguy32 says, when bitcoin is $1M each,  you have $11 bucks.

We don't own the bitcoin network we just use it.
I think you're like trying to make this fit, but it's not like the inventors of the computer or the Internet or email are any more guilty of anything than bitcoiners.
I don't wish ransomware on anyone and I hope they catch the perps.
Also, I don't think the city should pay - never pay scammers - and they should invest in a little bit more IT. 
But ransomware is effective because it hits organizations using typically rights and permissions the user themselves has. (Eg - a user can "enable macros" and then "encrypt all their files" because the files belong to them.)
Add to that a bit of lax (or just the nature of having tens or hundreds or thousands of computers to look after) and some will have - not working antivirus, not take the time to whitelist exes or blacklist running exes from the temp directory, not have working backups on user machines, have users all mapping drives all over the place which helps spread the malware, etc etc etc.  So It can all snowball very fast I'm sure.
Anyway none of that has anything to do with bitcoin, the scammers could ask for iTunes gift cards, MoneyPak, etc.
The criminals are pretty sophisticated. Some of them run call centers. Others scam asking for bitcoin but can't actually undo their ransomware (!!!!) - super assholery.

DCA just makes you feel better / less ripped off if the price tanks.
If you \*know\* an investment is going up, then jump in all at once.
But usually with bitcoin and money, you are taking money from somewhere, wondering where it can do better, chase a high in something like bitcoin, biotech stocks or something,
Then a reversion to the mean happens, the investment/speculation/gamble underperforms and you sigh and take your lumps.
Happened to me with biotech stocks, ah well. Interesting lesson learned.

The block reward halfing reduces the ready supply miners make. This affects all miners at the same time. The price adjusts independently with some lag or some lead, to reflect the new scarce reality. This means miners are potentially even more profitable as future supply halves. They are still profitable, it has no effect.

That's part of the fun of the experiment, I for one think not. We are arguing that you don't need monetary inflation as much as disinflationary and stable money.
In fact, that if someone introduces a more inflationary money, that people won't use it.
Didn't Peercoin, freicoin(?) one of them try this? Whatever, people have tried more inflationary cryptos and they flop as money because you could just have bitcoin instead and it preserves value better and more people accept bitcoin, so it gets caught up in virtuous circle loops that reinforce.
This article presupposes that a lot of HOLDERS of bitcoin would ever want the rules change to water down their holdings. hahah, my sides, NO. No, existing holders do not want their share watered down. Latecomers are just later. They should just be happy that they are younger and have youth. Or if they are old and coming late to the party, well whatever, at least bitcoin isn't discriminating.
A more interesting question is if existing holders of bitcoin would be willing to reduce supply. But I think that integrity comes first to true believers so no, they would not be interested in that self-defeating change either. Showing that you can change bitcoin to upset the balances or make this into a big game of future value hurts the future value, so I expect holders will resist change. Because they do, the ones that also want a predictable and change-resistant and trustworthy money get on board. 
Other latecomers are basically scammers and make up new scamcoins to get people on board. They can dress it up how they like, and add bells and whistles, but with recent changes, as MONEY, bitcoin is quite good. I still believe in a lot of Monero's ideas. But zcash is trash, etc. Other alts, if they act as like a world computer (Ethereum) are not going to be MONEY if you have rollbacks because of DAO etc.

How can we hand-craft transactions that we're SURE aren't Trojaned, is there any way?
Making a bitcoin address is relatively easy, just SHA256 something random, and then encode it in bitcoin's goofy style (and how do we make the private key... is that the key material, that's not SHA256-d, just encoded with a 5 at the beginning??)
But now, how do we go backwards and make a message that says: take from here, here, and here, send to here (new address), imply a miner's fee, and sign the mess and send it to a node?
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:07:10
Eh, prices are usually in dollars and euros, and so are people's debts, salaries, etc. So its natural for most people to think using something like dollars as their measuring stick - the "unit of account".
Most wallets know the current exchange rate, and when you make a purchase, the sellers usually have a convenient way to get you a quote at the current moment that's good for maybe 10 minutes to make a purchase.

We should add enough of a programming language to Libra so that they are not really sure what they're running until it runs, and when the transaction commits and tangles up into other transactions, then get swapped over to an anonymous super coin.

Yeah but the bitcoin node code has some checkpoints so it can know if the blockchain it's reading in is consistent with how things were, something like year by year, aren't there about 3-4 checkpoints in the nodes. So its not like someone could really steer you too far wrong. You still ultimately do have to join the real network of nodes and have your own node look at the work done and proof of work to know its really on the longest chain.
I don't think my idea is that bad. The worst thing about it is having the mailer know a delivery address to a person who runs a node.

Don't pick on just ferroh. I think that Satoshi is a normal guy. I think he lost the keys to 99% of his bitcoin. It would explain a LOT about his behavior. I think that most of his early bitcoin is unspendable. He probably mined a bit later though, right before GPU mining and got whiney because he missed some target number like 1000 bitcoin and probably only mined like 200 before giving up.
Him losing the keys explains his wallet argument, it explains why he gave up, it would explain why he walked away, stayed anonymous, doesn't sign his own blocks with the system he designed to be able to do just that.. etc

Bitcoin is a bit like that now, its not somethign I think your average person thinks of. I think maybe its like 1988 at best compared to what email was like. A lot of gateways and payment processors and other strange stuff.

In theory you could just put a straddle on it and make money off the chop up and down. Then let go if it runs away from you to the upside or the downside, and then re-collar it at whatever new level it hits.
A downside to that plan is eventually the exchange gets hacked.

Bitcoin goes up and down, it shakes people out by FOMO (wanting to urgently buy now - buying high), and disappointment (giving up and selling low). 
It is very hard to hold onto. It's kind of unreal and a good education in basic finance psychology.
If you have your finances on straight and don't fall for FOMO or disappointment, you'll probably be fine.

bitfinex does it, and I thought Okcoin could let you short too.
I think OKcoin does 10x or 20x leverage on long or short. So you can move fast and make a killing or get margin called really fast too of course.
I don't remember the leverage on bitfinex but it's there. You can also lend bitcoin, get paid interest on it, maybe something nuts like 100% in a year, depends on the demand from people shorting bitcoin.
Quick note - what you have at these exchanges are IOUs for dollars and bitcoin. Not actual dollars or bitcoins, until you try to wire your money out, or get them to send you your bitcoin. So be cautious and avoid exchanges that are having problems in case they're actually insolvent. Exchanges get hacked or mismanaged all the time.

I can't blame them, I wouldn't try. It's so hard to be a startup, you just can't hope to keep going if you're going to be regulated immediately. The New York market will have to be for those that can pay to play.
The application fee is not very large, but paying a good lawyer to help prep the documentation would be big. The next problem is it sounded like you have to have 100% reserves in fiat for any bitcoin balances, and that's a non-starter, because bitcoin is already money... (like having Yen but having to have an equivalent in dollars).  I can see how the regulations tried to have good intentions, but I think it was not a good idea to start off that way.

My money is on the idea that Satoshi had about 6 labs full of computers mining away on CPU. Then one of the labs got caught and shut down (keys gone). Then within a week or a month the whole group of them got found out and closed up. He lost all those bitcoin (they keys to unlock them anyway). Then he slowly mined at home and got meh maybe 200 coins just before GPU mining took off. 
This is my personal guess. So I bet Satoshi is locked out of his own project. ;) Hence the secrecy, hence this message is not signed by him.  If he *did* sign some bitcoin and it was thousands of blocks in, people would ask uncomfortable questions.
Or the email is hacked. I wouldn't put it past some of the shady early holders of bitcoin.

Here's the Ernst and Young Canada document link - [
Feel free to cut and paste anything interesting you find in it. Here's a long quote from page 6:
INVESTIGATION UPDATE Executive Summary  
10.The Monitor’s preliminary investigation identified the following principal concerns which it believes contributed to the current situation facing Quadriga and its Users: 
(a)Quadriga’s operating infrastructure appears to have been significantly flawed from a financial reporting and operational control perspective.  Activities were largely directed by a single individual, Mr. Cotten and as a result, typical segregation of duties and basic internal controls did not appear to exist;  
(b)No accounting records have been identified by the Monitor and there appears to have been no segregation of assets between Quadriga Funds and User Funds.  Funds received from and held by Quadriga on behalf of Users appear to have been used by Quadriga for a number of purposes other than to fund User withdrawals. With its available infrastructure, Quadriga does not appear to have had visibility into its profitability, if any; 
(c)The Company appears to have engaged in significant “cash” transactions.  The Monitor has been unable to verify if cash deposits were deposited into accounts containing User Funds and or properly recorded;  
(d)The  Monitor  has  been  unable  to  locate  basic  corporate  records  including  the location  and  security  passwords  associated  with  Quadriga’s  Fiat  and Cryptocurrency inventories between TPPs, bank accounts, wallet addresses and third-party exchanges.  In addition, the Monitor understands passwords were held by a single individual, Mr. Cotten and it appears that Quadriga failed to ensure adequate safeguard procedures were in place to transfer passwords and other critical operating data to other Quadriga representatives should a critical event materialize (such as the death of key management personnel); 
(e)The Company relied extensively upon the services of TPPs to administer its fiat treasury functions.  Adequate governance arrangements, oversight or reporting functions in relation to Fiat maintained by these third parties does not appear to have been in place; 
(f)User Cryptocurrency was not maintained exclusively in Quadriga’s hot and cold wallets.  Significant volumes of Cryptocurrency were transferred off Platform outside Quadriga to competitor exchanges into personal accounts controlled by Mr. Cotten.  It appears that User Cryptocurrency was traded on these exchanges and in some circumstances used as security for a margin trading account established by Mr. Cotten.  Trading losses incurred and incremental fees charged by exchanges appear to have adversely affected Quadriga’s Cryptocurrency reserves.  In addition, substantial amounts of Cryptocurrency were transferred to wallet holders whose identity the Monitor has been unable to confirm; 
 (g)Mr.  Cotten  created  Identified  Accounts  under  aliases  where  it  appears  that Unsupported  Deposits  were  deposited  and  used  to  trade  within  the  Platform resulting in inflated revenue figures, artificial trades with Users and ultimately the withdrawal of Cryptocurrency deposited by Users; and 
(h)Substantial Funds were transferred to Mr. Cotten personally and other related parties. The Monitor has not located any support justifying these transfers.

One of the things they need to do is work with Congress to just 'destroy' the assets they have taken on.
They've already ruined things by absorbing them, they need to now take them out of the market slowly, not put them back.
So that would mean things like buying stock, but having a mechanism for the shares to cease to exist too.
Otherwise we wind up like Japan with 0 percent interest rates and a moribund economy.
Anyway, bitcoin can't be confiscated so easily, nor inflated, so at least with bitcoin in theory their manipulations could be contained.
Also, they could buy bitcoin with fiat dollars and then send the bitcoin to a burner address, if you see what I mean, THAT could be helpful. ;)

* have no skills and make up their own coin from a meme community (dogecoin)
* have incredible programming skills and real talent and fix something bitcoin is missing, but which it will never have for lack of bitcoin community interest in it, like Turing completeness, Scrypt, or some other programming itch or angle they have (Etherium, Litecoin)
* enrich themselves with a premined centralized coin thing that they control (Ripple)
* have incredible skills and talent and buy into and build on top of bitcoin, or with bitcoin, and hope to ride its popularity upwards (colored coins, Lightning Network)
* have more money than time/skills :) and buy bitcoins
* have more money than time/skills and put that money into another cryptocurrency - very tempting if you have hundreds of millions of dollars at your disposal (this is like going the Ripple, Etherium, or dogecoin path - depending on your vision)
* have loads of money and no time to waste on cryptocurrency

Hilariously, that number may never change (2 to 5 tps) for bitcoin, but the actual transactions over lightning could be in the millions per second. Bitcoin would just keep humming on.
So what this means is that LN would be massively increasing the velocity of money which drags bitcoin price down.
On the other hand it makes it more practical to make payments which gives it a nice value (in the minds of human beings who are inventing this stuff to solve their problems). 
So it's a win-win :)

I did like you're doing now, back when bitcoin was a dollar. 
I could have been a mega mega mega dollar multimillionaire. But I was very close-minded then, and I basically talked myself out of buying any bitcoin. With the spare money I had, I could have bought, 8 or 9 THOUSAND bitcoins. Sigh.
But I believed in liberal Statism. Meaning, money comes from governments, has the backing of their economy, hand-waved the intrinsic value problem or not (I was never hung up on intrinsic value ideas). 
You obviously don't have to buy into this or *anything* you don't like. But a lot of bitcoiners are pretty passionate about the politics past the "coin".
Anyway, maybe there will be other awesome opportunities in life out there for you, just maybe keep your eyes peeled for good things.

Governments can still tax people, they could tax real estate.
That's what they should do, and it would give us all back our financial privacy.
Taxing only real estate would be very very fair, check out the wikipedia article on Georgism. It has been around since Adam Smith, and even the Chicago school of economics calls it very fair.
The basic idea is that land can't run away and evade anything. Someone owns it (maybe a corporation) and someone should pay tax on it. 
You can make some exceptions for small family homes, farms, things like that, but those would be subsidies. 
Past that, you have to come up with fair ways of assessing the value of land, and I recommend something like a pay-what-you-want system, where your taxes imply the buyout value of your land/home/commerical real estate.   -- So if you underpay your taxes, the market alone decides that they should buy you out. If you don't want to be bought out, then pay more taxes.
Then you could have a nice simple system. People would use land more efficiently and actively try to avoid owning actual land if they could, but everyone has to live somewhere (so you could somewhat exempt small personal homes), and everyone needs some place to put their stuff.
Buildings could become multi-use, and vanity buildings (like Apple's ring shaped building) would probably be bad investments. (Easy targets for people to bid up, in order to force Apple to move out.)
Then big corporations would be forced to pay more reasonable taxes. People could band together, chip in, to pay a corporations taxes (effectively buying the land out from under them), and disrupt their businesses by forcing them to move. OR ... they could pay reasonable taxes.

Yes, Coinbase is a custodian, they have the amount of bitcoin you are owed (an IOU really) in their database, and they have their own hot and cold wallets. You can send the bitcoin out to your own wallet, where you have the keys, and then you have custody. How that works is the blockchain is public. You make up a bitcoin address to send it to. You tell Coinbase to send to a bitcoin address and they will. They broadcast that send to address message to nodes who get it to miners. Miners mine your transaction into a block. Now it's on a public blockchain. Your wallet spots the bitcoins arriving at an address it controls. The address is usually a kind of public key, and you have a corresponding private key to go with it. They look like big strings of numbers and letters. The public one will begin with a 1 or a 3. The private one should begin with a 5 - never share that one. Your wallet can make linked groups of addresses with a "seed" - usually 12 or 24 special words that the wallet software will tell you to write down. It can recreate everything if you can keep the seed safe. So since that's so special, you need to keep it safe. Hand write it, don't let it touch a computer. Or punch it into steel if you worry about fire. There are so many things you can do, and so much to learn about. Check out bitcoin.org

The price only has to do with supply and demand. But if the price is higher, then it rewards mining it - at least until difficulty adjustment catches up.
If the market price goes lower, then it punishes miners who are spending too much on electricity or other costs and forces them to drop out. Then the difficulty goes down and makes things easier.
Yes, the hash rate is a lottery, so the higher the hash rate, the more likely you are to be mining and succeeding. Most miners join pools to improve their own individually tiny chances of mining a block, so they can split the earnings.

The highest payoff will go to the person that "knows" that X is best and puts 100% of their disposable wealth into it. All the zealots that pick something else will be either wiped out or stalled, and no one is going to go interview the losers for quotes about what could have been.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding these futures markets.
Say it was in Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ), or sugar, or pork bellies -- doesn't someone have to take physical delivery???
That's the point of these markets. Someone is helping out by being a middleman, and that helps companies, like Southwest Airlines, who plan on using jet fuel, it helps them know for certain (at a cost) what their future costs will be for these commodities that they use...
I thought the whole point is that someone has to physically take these bitcoin (get them sent to their wallet). If they don't, then I don't like this setup. I don't want them speculating on the price if they don't want the underlying.
Now obviously, you can have these futures markets people play ping pong and knock the price back and forth between each other, and keep on kicking the day of reckoning down the road, but SOMEDAY the future has to settle out, because someone speculating is left bagholding it, either they bought bitcoin they don't want with cash, or vice-versa.
Or they don't have to baghold, they can just sell at a loss or something.

Mmmmmmmmmm maybe. When you buy you are adding some records to who owns what. After that, it's hard to tell if you're transacting or not, but you're certainly on a list somewhere. Unless you mined it, maybe.
I can agree that in theory a privacy coin is not a good store of value. But on the other hand, bitcoin without privacy would really work against your interests, even if it gains in fiat value.
So, I'm hedging my bets, all I will say. Because privacy is super important to me.

Doesn't matter if you do or don't right now bad money (cash) is driving out good (bitcoin). Meaning, ultimately people are spending cash (even if they use bitcoin).
Because holding bitcoin which is appreciating makes more sense. It has to be this way for a while.
If you spend bitcoin and don't rebuy, you are spending your bitcoin.
If you spend bitcoin and rebuy, you are actually just spending cash.
Whether your rebuy bitcoin or not, all you are doing is subtly adjusting your ratios of cash to bitcoin. (Some people are not into bitcoin and are all cash, that's fine).
Sorry bitcoin's better?

You can believe what you want. I see no evidence that he has the keys, nor that he doesn't. It's a null hypothesis. I hypothesize that he's lost (most of) them. You hypothesize that he hasn't. 
I think my hypothesis explains better why he doesn't sign a message on the blockchain that he supposedly has keys to; a system that not only moves inputs to outputs but is also built to sign messages. So I laugh a little at poor Satoshi. It's probable actually that I have more bitcoin than him.

This is like ELI15:
You open a channel with someone else (and they might open one back). The channel has a capacity. That initial opening is written to the bitcoin blockchain.
You and the other side work with small amounts and digitally sign valid bitcoin transactions that say pay X, or pay amount Y, and those can go back and forth. Those are not played to the blockchain.
They don't need to be, anyway, but they are valid bitcoin transactions and COULD be played to the blockchain but I think that would also close the channel.
When you want to close the channel, one side or the other can play the last valid message they have. This is when you want to quit, or one side or the other goes off the network and/or times out. If someone times out on you, you get the best value you had a contract for.
(I think Watchtowers look out for people who got kicked off line, in case someone is cheating. I think you share your last good transaction with a Watchtower)
When you want to make payments to someone else, you probably don't have to open another channel, you can route the payment with the bitcoin you have escrowed in the first channel you opened, assuming you still have the balance.
And the LN will find a path and route it along channels to the person you want to pay.
It should all be super fast and should scale massively. Since you have the anchoring of the channel opening, but you should be able to move messages around at a blistering pace - assuming there is enough channel liquidity end to end.

@_date: 2019-06-12 19:56:22
Well yes the powers that be will delay and delay and hold off and hold off, and try to cast all this change into the future.
But either way, I see these possible outcomes:
1. financial tyranny, bitcoin outlawed, total surveillance states
2. financial freedom, very close to absolute privacy, Swiss bank account in your pocket with bitcoin, but you may have to change your citizenship and locale in order to get out from under certain nation states and out to free ones that work better. Example, you might go from Britain the the Czech Republic.
3. financial openness, where you are a lot less restricted on what you spend, a pull back on quantitative easing, sound money principles from the government, much more drug legalization (in general less restricted things to spend on), dropping trade barriers/tarriffs/ less financial close-offs to parts of the world (hah, very unlikely!)
4. maybe a move to a gold standard (extremely unlikely)
5. a move to a multipolar financial world instead of one just based on the petrodollar - seems extremely likely - eventually
There will be all kinds of shakeups and the one bitcoin puts as stress on nation states will be ridiculously small but possibly an intractable "pebble in the shoe" - something that they just can't make go away nor really deal with. Yet is also not quite worth tackling, yet constantly annoys. 
It will be interesting to see what happens. I'm sure there will be a lot of frustrated Statists.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:57:01
Deflation would be weird yes. Essentially you have to wonder, would all production (and jobs) come to a halt because those who have capital would rather hoard and keep it idle rather than purchase something? 
I think it becomes hypothetically a game of chicken. First one to take huge bitcoin holdings, sell, grab enough of the world to control it towards a new better direction, and send things rebounding upwards into a world where holding deflationary bitcoin is irrelevant, would be interesting.
Example: presume bitcoin can buy more and more and more. But what if the things people want to buy are all digital like online game things. What do you "have"? A suit of fancy armor? An endless MP3 library? An AI that can answer any question you have about life?
My big worry is wondering what people will do as jobs in the future where everything is digital.
Corporations have been benefiting from loose monetary policy too right now. Some business models are only profitable because the cost of capital is so low. And I really like some of these businesses, like Tesla and solar installations.
But on the other hand, this situation is forcing ordinary people to chase really crazy investments. No one can just get 7% by having a savings account. So the world to me seems a bit haywire.

Bitcoin All Time High is an erection that lasts too long. Bitcoin ATCH can develop without financial stimulus and doesn’t go away after buying at the previous all time high. There is a risk of having bitcoin ATH after buying more bitcoin and seeing it go higher.
When you have a full bitcoin ATH, no fresh money flows into your checking account. This means that your checking account isn’t getting money, which can damage your credit rating when your checks bounce, because you spent the money on bitcoin at the All Time High.

Markets are made of participants of all sizes :)
In bitcoin, you can think of people looking at future returns on bitcoin, compared to their current position in assets and then making a choice:
"Do I want less risk, more certain returns on this future value, by getting some value out now?" 
"Do I have plenty of assets (or am I a desperate degenerate gambler) and I would like to build on my certain asset base (or deep hole) and increase my risk, but on the higher possible payout in the future?"
Everyone's doing this, with stocks, real estate, all kinds of things, and cryptos are just a new way to do it.

Oh sure, on the left side, you have the cash committed to buy, and how much bitcoin that could buy at the spot price in the middle (whatever it last sold for).
So from where the left and right meet, in the valley, the left side is the buyers.  The right hand side is the sellers.
If you see a vertical wall, what that is is a large amount of bitcoin that someone wants to sell at a specific price. The shape of that curve up and away to the right from the mid point represents the accumulated bitcoin in height, and going to the right what price in dollars they'll sell that. Walls there represent "resistance" to price rises. If the walls turn the buyers back, buyers start to lose hope of a breakout (and gains), and give up and either drop their buys or become sellers themselves.
The left side represents buyers. The height represents how much bitcoin, total, in USD value is trying to buy. The distance going back to the left is the specific price they want to buy at. Walls there on the buy side represent "support". 
But buy and sell walls can flash, come and go, and on some exchanges the buy and sell walls can be invisible :/ (for big buyers or big sellers). So it's more of a fun game. You are watching the surface fight of buyers who ponied up cash and wired it into the exchange (which takes time) and sellers who transferred bitcoin from their wallets to the exchange to sell (which is easy to do in an hour at home 24/7). So the sellers have a slight advantage. This leap to $10k has taken a month to develop. It can take a shit load of time to get an account approved, get in KYC / AML paperwork, and get trading. Selling your bitcoin is so fast, that in my opinion there's always downwards pressure.
Now smarter traders always keep some back in fiat for good buying opportunities, and never sell all their crypto or spend all their dollars.

Once the price of a bitcoin is only going up or down about a million dollars in a day, then it will be stable enough to be currency. The whole world will get flipped on it's ear. As you start to see big banks lend out to each other in cryptocurrencies instead of nation state fiat, that's when you know it's tipped. They'll start to prefer that countries owe them in either dollars or something like bitcoin, and they'll be happy with either. That's the tipping point.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:29:20
Oh sure, back up start over. I didn't mean to come off with snark.
Okay so say first of all that cryptocurrencies are not rare, start with that. There was a website around, where I think for something like .02 bitcoin, someone would give you source code and a working gui wallet for your own coin. You could give it a name, a logo, your choice of proof of work algorithms, blocksizes, all kinds of parameters, then you had a coin. It was that easy.
Now in the world of ordinary dollars and euros and raffle tickets, you too can take a piece of paper and write "$5 dollars" on it, and see if anyone will give you money for it or find it valuable.
You can also make a spreadsheet, and just track how much money people had. There's a joke subreddit that did that. and the coin is - its all a joke.
Next, you could be the Fed, and you can just decide how much money different members should have and how much debt the banks should hold, and all kinds of interesting monetary policy. It's over my head, but I've come around to the idea that maybe the US would be better off which different regional dollars. That would help make parts of the country more competitive. Eh, moving on...
You can fork a coin, by just choosing to do it. Your fork starts with the initial history (or starts over  from scratch) and has whatever rules going forward that you want. If you don't change the mining algorithm, then people can choose to mine your coin or the old one it forked from. They just have to decide which one has a brigher future.
Next, network effects. If I have a fax machine, and you don't, then it's not very useful. If we both have a fax machine, it's good for us. As more people join in, this fax thing gets more and more useful.
If I have cryptocurrency A, and you have cryptocurrency B, we're at an impasse unless one of us will trade A for B or vice versa at some exchange rate. If cryptocurrency A is constantly growing because of random hacks and people can make up money undetected, that's going to show up in the exchange rate with cryptocurrency B which is more secure or has a slower emission rate. Since B is obviously better, some people will sell A and hold B. Others will wait for a good time to sell A and buy B. Others will hold A and hold out hope for future improvement of their position.
I don't want to ramble but ... if you make a fork of a coin, what about it makes it better than the previous coin? Because we have to do some work to switch to it or even to make things compatible. So you have to have a compelling case. 
Some of these forks are premined, where like the person doing the fork secretly mines 1 to 10% ahead of time, and releases code and a binary for CPU/GPU mining that's borked and inefficient, while the forker secretly mines on a more efficient binary. Issues like that I think made Monero fork from (Bytecoin?) 
Anyway, you could fork bitcoin and give yourself lots of it, change a parameter like block size. Why would anyone join you?
Now in the bitcoin cash drama, that's a fork of bitcoin, and the larger blocks made old business models that relied on tiny fees viable again - like Satoshi Dice. Since it's very compatible with bitcoin, except for the block size, they could restart their out of date business model. So that's a viable fork, in a way.
The market is deciding, since most people and banks operate in the realm of fiat currencies, everyone right now sees not a lot of choice besides buying cryptocurrencies using whatever fiat they have. But some people pay in altcoins or bitcoin to get other coins and speculate on their future value. That's like anything.
Cryptocurrencies base value is that they are like a slowly growing hard drive that you pay to have digitally signed messages recorded into it forever.
Right now we are pretending that bitcoins are like money. Because of their divisibility a bitcoin (limit 21 million) will probably give around a million smaller addresses. I personally think that in 20 years, the block chain will be a huge number of digitally signed messages ~ 1 petabyte in size. Most of these things will probably be colored coins - meaning standing in for other things, or other second layer solutions settling out or opening. 
Don't freak out too much, a petabyte will fit in your watch.

The point is to use real-world resources in order to keep out those that wish to interfere and to encourage an economic commitment to the bitcoin network's success. And to earn bitcoin and support the networks consensus rules, which favor the honest majority and prevent cheating.
(something like that)

Well the wall has to not get eaten through before the bulls run out of steam to buy, then the prices can fall, because there's two kinds of buying - passive, where you have buys set up for people to sell into, like nets for catching bitcoin, or active, where you get filled at market price at the lowest of the sells. Those active bulls are the ones testing the walls. The supporting bulls are there for cheap coins.
So yes, a huge sell wall normally causes bulls to lose steam. But if they see there are no further walls, they could have a breakout.
If the sellers, bears, sell - dump onto the market, they can crash through support walls and cause a break down.

Bitcoin is hard to predict. The best prediction of the future price is the current price.
I bought a little lately, so I am still accumulating, but to each their own.
I've also had to bag hold for a couple years, and that's really disappointing. So I've lived through that and happy that I didn't sell it all, but mad at myself for selling some. Basically I had too much in, and couldn't bear having bitcoin go lower and lower and still had bills to pay.
So overall, I'd rather buy bitcoin than buy lottery tickets?

I think Coinbase pays the miner fee, so it's free to you.
Coinbase is a broker, and they have a hot and cold wallet. They have marked out in a database how much bitcoin you have, so unless there's some special setup (they do have a "Vault" option), you have a bitcoin IOU with them and you should move the coins off to your own custody when you're ready.

Not 100% belaboring the point, but ... as far as intrinsic value goes.
There might not be intrinsic value. It might be more situational. Which do you want more, a bar of gold, or a parachute? Am I safe on the ground? gold. Am I in a crashing airplane? parachute.
Am I starving? food. Do I at least have the basics in life? education.
I do agree that an education is a normally a very good use of money that you spend and invest in yourself.
Sometimes though, people that don't have good planning skills get taken advantage of and they get saddled with a lot of debt for a degree that won't help them pay the loans back. That's a shame and it's a trap that I wish we could get rid of. Education, by itself, is a nice thing to have.

Things are looking a little interesting.
There's a huge support wall on the green side, just under 286, around 285.90
An order there is set to buy about 400 bitcoin.
Then resistance on the red side, there's a 50 bitcoin small wall right around
$289.20, and a larger 100 bitcoin wall further up at $291.20 or so.
So if you wanted to be buying, you could put a small buy down around $286 and
see if something falls into it (right before the 400 bitcoin support)
Or if you wanted to sell, put your sells in front of or just behind the other
walls on the right hand side.

Section 3 has the modifications to LN to make this LN ground.
The Conclusions in Section 4 say it best:
"Secret preimages can replace exposure of temporary private keys in the Lightning Network constructs with no loss of generality, and a slight gain in simplicity. 
The use of script conditionals to enforce timeouts instead of using separate pre-signed transactions reduces an HTLC [hash time locked contract] from a set of four dual-signed transactions to a single (more complex) output script, and additionally avoids any requirement for new CHECKSIG flags for HTLCs.
By using a dual anchor and escape transactions, channel establishment can also avoid new CHECKSIG flags, though it loses the important ability to outsource the enforcement of channel contract terms." (Russel, 2015)
And at this point, I think that programmable money is amazing :)

Exactly. No fake transactions.
If someone wants to encode cat pictures to the block chain and inefficiently pay a lot of bitcoin in fees, they can.
If someone wants to literally use the blockchain to push bitcoin values around and use it like it's money, they can.
And if someone wants to layer a colored coin on bitcoin or have other forms of indirection encoded in bitcoin, they can.
Fees are just what you pay per byte, and at any given moment there's a market to get your information recorded.

Not really, zoom out to the big picture. 
If bitcoin is easier to use on the Internet than dollars ...
(because you can cross banking borders and cut out the middlemen)
And is technically a better money than dollars 
(irreversible nearly instant settlement - much like a wire transfer but faster - and more certain slow growth on issuance - and if you really want it so bad, you can mine it)
Then if you spend bitcoin, without rebuying, you are selling your bitcoin.
If you spend bitcoin, and refill from your dollars, you have indirectly spent using dollars.
What you can expect, by a slight variation on Gresham's Law  - bad money drives out good - is that yes, people will keep the value in bitcoin, and spend (get rid of) trash money (dollars) and keep bitcoin as hard as they can.
It's okay, prices will be priced in dollars, yen, euros, for a while.

The best thing about this article is how everything is good for bitcoin. It has a bit about how it's hard to use as a currency and it's under regulatory scrutiny. 
It's just such a simple basic first-mover situation. It's a nice easy basic cryptocurrency. Onto that, the scrutiny like by taxes, means that people are less likely to spend, which constricts market supply (good for bitcoin). If the use case as a store of value goes up enough, that's great.
Then, if the gain in user base is linear, then by Metcalfe's law, the gains are still exponential. If people think that at these prices adoption is low, wait til adoption doubles. Ah. Good times. 
Anyway, enjoy the oncoming year 2020, it should be fun and exciting.

SO maybe on page 16, where they have futures in currency, to help someone with a contract, that might be good for someone that wants to buy something and pay bitcoin later, but isn't sure if the price of bitcoin will run away on them.
Page 17, that might be good for bitcoin miners, to lock in a future bitcoin price, I think they could be the other side of the trade.
Maybe that's right, not sure. :)

@_date: 2015-08-18 17:17:51
Yeah, with bitcoin it's not about experts like core devs etc. 
It's about 
* community use of the coin as a currency
* community belief in it being solid to hold it
* community expectations that it can grow and absorb more of the fiat world and become more valauble over time
* and the hash power of 51% to resist attacks and give it security (maybe 60%) 
Any where the economic majority wants to take it is where bitcoin is going to go. Bitcoin users want it to grow and spread in influence.
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:15:07
You open a big channel with someone with a Lightning Node, with a decent sized balance, say $200 worth of bitcoin. You do that once, like say today in February.
You might set it up to close automatically in a year and settle up.
And that channel you open with somewhere big and major that can handle the other side of that.
You play that channel opening and get it committed to the blockchain.
Bitcoin transactions are little programs, they're not just balances of bitcoin. (Very very small programs typically).
From then on, you don't commit anything to the blockchain, you pass back and forth signed commitments for bitcoin that other people can trade and redeem etc.
Either end of a channel can say 'okay I'm closing this' (and I think THEY pay the fees to close up), and however this works out, what they're really doing is played a transaction you both signed.
That settles out on the blockchain and finishes moving bitcoin around.
If they try and cheat you by playing to the network something you haven't signed, the best they can do is go back in time to something that you have signed, and it's going to be a transaction where the balance is in your favor (like doesn't have the purchase of your last coffee in it).
And off-chain the LN network can route payments as throughout participants in the LN network.
That's my understanding. It may not be perfect or quite right and I appreciate corrections.

Right now a block will be on the order of 1MB to 2MB in size. 6-12 an hour, and 144-288 MB in a day. And a 30 day month would be 4.3 gigs to 8.6 gigs in size.
So ... make your RAM 8.6 gigs. 
Now you have plenty of mempool space.
So the next problem focus is that in any given day, there is only so much space for storing information.
Now have some actors out there. One of them wants to encode and store jpegs of cats. 
Another person wants to actually transfer bitcoin and pretend that the values they're throwing around are money.
Well ... the one trying to encode cat pictures, really badly, is going to add little fees to everything they do. 
You can call it spam, but to them its "important". 
The other person trying to get something done just has to pay a little bit more to be a time priority - they want their transaction mined sooner rather than later.

You can worry all you like but people are free to take enormous financial risks with their own money.
If they go talk to a fiduciary, then the fiduciary needs to give them straight forward financial advice that fits their situation. It's probably not going to include putting 1% of net worth into bitcoin, but that might be a better idea than putting 10% into bonds floated by Argentina, Iraq, and Greece. What can you do?
You can't live other people's lives for them. If they make bad choices at the rate of 1 bad financial choice a year, they could have lucky streaks but eventually it will catch up to them.

They could do it but then who are their customers? Who would find value in staying with the chain.
By the way, this is the brouhahah about China and miners in China. There's always some fear attack that China's CCP will tell the bitcoin miners in China what to do and that they have to censor transactions. But even if the territory inside China has 55% of the hashpower (disputable) that doesn't mean that the 45% of the hashpower located outside of China physically couldn't mine a transaction that the CCP didn't like. They could.
Now when you say all the miners in the whole world, I kind of roll my eyes.
Right now, yes, bitcoin is mined with ASICS and yes, it takes a lot of effort to get an ASIC going and China has the right mix of cheap hydro, ASIC fabs, basic technical know-how, official corruption, desperate provinces who want money, an educated workforce (in some ways), a desire to escape capital controls, etc etc. So all those factors are making China a major player in bitcoin mining. But the whole world isn't China, and doesn't have their exact mix of problems, values, corruption, etc.
But a lot of the rest of the world has the same kind of global elites helping their bankster friends, eg see Brexit, and also see the EU and ECB, the Federal Reserve, Goldman Sachs, etc, and just see that there is grassroots support by people who find bitcoin to be valuable in combatting them.
Anyone can become a miner, it's permissionless, and anyone can fork and modify bitcoin code to do whatever. So the miners are not actually that powerful, and as Bitmain has shown, you can try to mine/pump a coin, like BCH, and pretend there's some massive support for it, but the market has spoken, and bitcoin is the winner, and Bitmain has heavy bags of BCH they can't get rid of.

Bitcoin has helped me understand that I don't have "X dollars" in my 401k, what I have instead is a basket of stock indexes, that today Mr Market think is worth, hypothetically, "X dollars" - but obviously when I sell, if I sell, there will be some slippage. 
Also, I am most likely to change my allocation to other assets at the worst possible time (after disappointment in what I've chosen - selling low) and switching to something else that has done better (FOMO - fear of missing out), so inevitably you just get shit on in the markets. (But actually, you just play yourself.)
Um, so overall, bitcoin has been good for me. Ordinary stock market movements barely catch my notice anymore. The stock market could "crash" 20% and to me that would just look like a buying opportunity.

The top layer, layer 7 in the OSI model is Application, you could put bitcoin up there.
Though obviously, nodes are listening on a TCP/IP levels at level 3 (IP addresses) and 4 (port - apparently TCP 8333)
If there's any concept of "sessions" - layer 5 - it could be happenign between nodes, as they do connect to each other.
And if they have any libraries for decoding the messages sent between them, that would be Layer 6.

If I were you, I would buy a little bit of every coin you find interesting. What I did was go a bit feet-first. While waiting for purchases to clear, I would learn how the coins worked and what they did, what they were for. Then I was ready with a wallet to receive. 
I wouldn't go too crazy because you have to take computer security to another level to stay safe. You start buying bitcoin, putting it on your computer, then downloading a miner for another coin and find your bitcoins have been stolen. :S  Hasn't happened to me, but it's a risk if you're using a machine to browse the web, mine, and keep a wallet on.
So be careful but get into all the coins you want.

Think of the government you see around you as having developed from european styles. It seems like in europe once upon a time, random warlords would set up thug installations at river crossings and charge you for toll - toll houses etc. They basically extorted merchantmen and travellers etc. They became the nobility and aristocracy later. Made castles and made war on each other. All divine right of kings stuff, but basically thugs. That's what modern govts are like. They basically extort people over threat of violence (putting you in a cage because you don't want to pay is how they get you). 
So basically they make up rules, and they could make up a rule like "you owe us a satoshi for every breath you take, and more - like 10 satoshis - if you wear clothes made of silver". Taxation is all that stupid and thuggish. 
If people think they need govt for protection, then it's basically a protection racket.

Yeah I agree. I think that if someone has been in bitcoin for a few years, you get used to the idea that Satoshi Dice would be on chain. That's not possible with BTC, but was possible with BCH. Meh. I don't really play anything like that, so that's not my use case. But it seems obvious that some old business models could come back to life if the fees were lower. It's kind of living in the past, but a valid case for those that want to buy into it.
I also just think he's wasting his money and selling all bitcoin to get BCH will probably burn him. Just like if he had any coins in Mt Gox when it died, etc.

Eh I'm not sure.
Lightning network right now lets people open channels to each other and pass value back and forth and settle out when they want to.
Multi-participant, open ended channels are probably coming soon. With those, we don't need a central hub or anything, just you and me, and another person, and another and another, and soon we are all passing around messages that anyone could choose to play on the blockchain if they absolutely MUST settle out, but we'll just play hackeysack with the commitment, and you might find we are scaling to VISA on a system like that.

Sounds great, that's what the whole experiment is about. I am all for letting the fees do that work. I am not really interested in giving miners a bunch of rewards when they knew the halving was coming. Since we all know the halvings are coming, we buy today in anticipation of future scarcity and possible value. This deferred gratification and actually giving something up to get something into the future is what gives this money a value, collectively, all of us. So we all look forward to this future if you are already a holder. Latecomers are fine, they can look forward to not having their money debased.

The story of Lamborghini is awesome. A car company created because Enzo Ferrari couldn't take constructive criticism from a Ferrari owner who knew how to make cars/trucks/tractors. Lamborghini was in Italy and fixed cars and trucks from many nations in Italy in WW2 - American, British, German, etc. So he had a lot of interesting experience with many ways of doing things mechanically. His own Ferrari was a bit of a lemon. He took it to Ferrari and wanted to comment on it to the head of the company. Got dissed by Ferrari. Made the Lambo to show how it could be done. Made several models. Obviously later, had a mega hit with the Countach. The rest is history.

Don't be too hasty getting it off, in case you pull it and push it to something else that's bad.
Eg, if you have a lot of value, check out a Trezor, but even there you have to be cautious. Big caution there is that if you buy off Amazon, you could get bad hardware or a suggested (hacked) word list. You would want to buy direct from Trezor and ask in about it

The "1 country 2 systems" agreement is breaking down. HK's government is in control of quisling puppets who do whatever the mainland wants. The mainland wants people extradited for things that would be crimes in China. Things like remembering Tiananmen Square or wanting democracy, or a fair and impartial justice system, or basically not Communism.
It's not like I know tons about this - I don't - never been there. My news on this I glean from Youtubers, so I obviously consume a slanted view on this.
I like watching "serpentza" and "laowhy86" - South African and an American who married  Chinese wives on the mainland but right now foreigners seem pretty unwelcome in China under Xi Jinping. And I watch China Uncensored on Youtube for the laughs. But I think they got Falun Gong funding. (Falun Gong was a meditation group with a lot of members that decided it would be anti-corruption so now they get their organs harvested. I think they are considered a cult, and they might have spacy views regarding medicine - like our anti-vaxxers, but I don't know anything about it other than the Chinese government HATES them and can basically never back down once they identify a group as enemy.)
Anyway, all these protests are that in Hong Kong people can be extradited to Mainland China where they will face being disappeared (killed or imprisoned), imprisoned, executed, etc, for things that are ordinary protests in a democracy. They may or may not get a mock trial. People have already been kidnapped from Hong Kong to China for publishing books critical of China.
Did you know the PLA - People's Liberation Army - the army of China, is there to defend the Communist Party, not Chinese itself. It defends the CCP from the larger country and anything they think is an external or internal enemy. Hence, Tiananmen Square.

It should probably work.  DO let us know how it works out.
There's 144 megabytes of data in a day. A 14400 baud modem can keep up (in theory). It downloads 6 MB in an hour. 24 hours a day. 144 megabytes in a day.
The bandwidth is not the problem, just the latency. And if you get ping times under 100ms to 150ms, you're probably fine. Faster connects would be way better. Like the connects in a datacenter or a University dorm room or something.

"You don't understand the issues around identity proofing. Signed, Satoshi"

Personally, I'm a little surprised at Gavin, because he came across as very meek and conformist.

I think that a common objection is that they want to see fees become meaningful. So that in 100 years, it's not a hand-wavy prospect that miners would earn fees even when bitcoin stops producing.
To that I say, hogwash. Solve the problem 100 years from now - 90 years from now. Today's problem is one of growth. You need to have bitcoin simply work.
The Chinese miners complaining about bandwidth. That's also terrible hogwash. China is not a huge backwards place like people think. They had fiber optic connections to the hinterlands where that dam was and the bitcoin miners set up shop and got to use their fiber connects. They probably had 10ms to Beijing from the middle of nowhere. Some of that country is poor and isolated. Some other parts of that country are as high tech as high tech gets.

But, good intentions like making "bad things" illegal result in the current situation. 
It's the good intentions which cause these problems. People have to become more accepting and not make victimless crimes illegal.
If we prax it out, prostitution not being illegal would make them all not criminals and prostitutes could have a safer situation. 
And for drugs maybe we can do something like Portugal did, being a drug user is not illegal but selling drugs is. So then people don't become criminals as well as drug abuse victims at the same time.

I think it's going okay. Rusty posts here sometimes and he seems to be working on it..
I think things are going slow because there's a lag between whitepapers, a prototype, and then having people use it more officially. 
If it was possible to define LN by saying something like - here's the ideas in the whitepaper, here are the example transactions that make this work - here's a way to do it by rolling your own transactions and using Bitcoin core to do it - and finally, here's a client/server code to do it without the difficulty of roll your own. Then I think LN would be moving faster. But it seems like it will be along in a year or so?
I think LN would go faster if there were some building blocks that anyone could try out - (and maybe this is possible?) - like a set of "recipe" like instructions on how to use the Bitcoin core client to craft up an LN message and escrow some funds with an LN server and start to chat back and forth with it, "buying" stuff, and then at the end, having the final transaction settling out. Like a test LN server that can give you a "Refund" at the end when you're done and you want to close out the circuit. So you could check your wallet and see if you are ready to be a client.
Then, second stage, being a Lightning server and being able to pass around blocks of bitcoins with the riddle system they proposed. That would be cool. :)

Normal dumb dumbs think that this is a way to spread risk/return, like buying an index fund. But it's somewhat equivalent to buying a combo of gold, silver, toilet paper, poop, and water. Uh.... Not sure why people would do that. These aren't stocks.

The only kinds of purchases that you could make where standing around waiting for just 1 confirmation is a big deal is if the value is way greater than $2.50.
So like jewelry, handbags, those kinds of expensive luxury items - that could be, potentially, pretty annoying that you would have to wait for a least 1-confirmation.
But a lot of items that are reasonably secured by 1 or 2 confirmations - purchasing land, houses, cars, boats, or drop-shipping from a warehouse, the confirmation wait time is meaningless.

Thanks, that's so nice of you to read my rambling text...
Taxation: right now the US has decided that cryptos are a commodity, like aluminum ore. If you mine it, you get taxed at the market value of spot prices for the day, if you sell it, you have to pay on your basis etc. If you're in Japan, I hear it's a currency. So like going between dollars, euros and yen, you don't pay on "gains". I wish that bitcoin had been defined as a currency. In other places they can do different things. See your local tax office ... 
Can government shut bitcoin down, yes, that's one of the existential risks that goes into everyone's calculation of getting wiped out.  
Getting your speculation/investment nullified or wiped out is a big downside. Another risk is that people that like government power and security (aka "Statists") are going to put a mark on bitcoiners and deny them jobs, turn them into criminals etc. It's possible right? So not a non-factor.
There are other risks, let me find a good link .... (while I searched for that, I just realized that the FAQ has good info --  )
Here's FINRA's page on bitcoin risks:
That's pretty middle-of-the-road advice on the risks. I don't think I could quote a more mainstream trustworthy source, for you or your dad?
If I can just add, I think that the biggest risks in bitcoin are these:
1) It's not as anonymous as people think - so privacy centric coins have some value by that defect in bitcoin
2) And it might not be as programmable as a money as people think - so that's giving value to Ethereum; via contracts people use cookie cutter contracts to spin off a myriad of altcoins on top of Ethereum.
3) There's not a direct benefit to a passive holder - gives value to Dash and proof of stake coins 
4) There's no obvious way to peg bitcoin to other coins in order to suck the value out of the other coins. Meaning, if it was easier to create peg pools between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, then bitcoin would drain all the fucking value out of them (because it would be the largest and most liquid coin). But since it can't quite do that yet, and it's getting closer to doing this every day, then well .. it's possible that other coins might still exist, but not have anything other than notional value, relative to bitcoin, and if bitcoin is accumulating all the value, it would start to become (or kind of already is) the "unit of account" for altcoins. Lots of alts are only for sale in bitcoin, so their "unit of account" is already bitcoin. 
EDIT: shoot wanted to add one  more thing about buying cars or houses with bitcoin. The sellers of things right now are still usually measuring their wealth, and pricing things, in a unit of account like dollars. So conceptually, they are converting dollars to bitcoin and back in their heads when they think about how much things are worth. This sub is an example, as it enjoys bitcoin $9k and bitcoin $10k. They are measuring in their heads the purchasing power of their bitcoins in dollars or euros or yen because that's what their debts are in, salaries are in, savings are in, and what the goods they buy are in.
Cars and houses can be sold for bitcoin or any cryptocurrency pretty easily. There are companies out there like Bitpay that will act as middlemen. They let the companies accept bitcoin without having to understand it. Bitpay will take bitcoins, give the sellers dollars (or a mix of dollars and bitcoins, if the company wants to have a little bitcoin on the side.). 
Now the government LOVES to track financial movements. So they will be keen to know who is buying cars and houses (or gold and jewelry) or darker things like financing terrorism, drugs etc. It's my understanding that real estate can be purchased in the US *without* having to disclose where the money came from. It just looks really  suspicious on your taxes if you own fancy houses and have no income. You have to show proof that you have the funds, but you don't have to say where it came from. I'm not a real estate attorney. (Quick google:     )     Eh, it's kind of a loophole, but not one that concerns me.
Terrorist financing is just a boogeyman. To take a real world example, I didn't realize that the IRA (Irish whatever) had people in the US that bought them guns and sent them money. So that's basically supporting terrorism or liberation or whatever you want to believe. I stay a million miles away from violence. I think that a purely super anonymous cryptocurrency could be used to buy or fund all kinds of things. But I think it's important to remember that - take a group like ISIS - they're out there (or were) out there in the field doing horrible things. If the government wants to go organize air strikes or something or war and a ground invasion to take them on, that would still happen. If Saudis used cryptocurrency to anonymously fund them, I don't see how that changes anything. Secret supporters of things have always existed. See: secret societies.

Later a bitcoin wallet would be a good idea, but it can wait until you know more. Generally, you have to up your game in computer security to use a wallet. Phone wallets for small amounts, two factor and separate computers for huge amounts. What's big or small amounts of bitcoin is up to you.
I wouldn't leave bitcoin on Coinbase longer than a few months, but that's enough time. Check out bitcoin.org, that has tons of detailed info.

One of the problems the crypto space seems to have is that we as users can't tell the difference between some problem between paying banks, law enforcement, and selective scamming.
I for one, would really like it if - if your money is seized because of AML\\KYC, that you got due process. EG, fine, seize the money, but give me a police case to follow up on, and/or have my lawyer know who to sue. So that a person can have their day in court.
Otherwise, it always looks like selective scamming.

Since it's not something they could ordinarily do anything about, UTXOs just get bigger and bigger.
Where they do know the private key, but some brain wallet guessing miracle like this, then they can slowly clear it out. Probably not something to rely on? And/or it's an underhanded tactic by the spammers to get someone else to do that second mining of the UTXOs in order to fill blocks twice - once to make them, and once again to sweep it up, and to .... reward(?) the miners for participating in their scheme to fill blocks. 
Such a weird game. But the fees are there to make it so that eventually spammers should run out of bitcoin doing this.
If there wasn't a guessable private key (like normal) then the unspent outputs grow and grow, taking space to track. So I assume they eat more and more memory or disk space.
I don't think the main bitcoin nodes do pruning of those.

The LN channel fixes it because it's basically how fast can two people with channels on any connected edge of this network - how fast can they send a signed message back and forth?
When people open and close channels, establishing them for the first time, or settle and close a channel - that transaction gets written (Settled) to bitcoin's blockchain.
You close the channel by playing the last signed message you have out to bitcoin. It has the last settled balance, or you could have a better one that's also signed with a better balance if the other party has gone AWOL on you.
It's like saying - how often do you open or close a bank account, and then from there, relative to that, how many purchases do you make?
Or - how often do you open or close a cable TV account, and from there, how many pay per view shows do you watch

I think that Rusty's explanation is really good.
* Part 1:  
* Part 2:  
* Part 3:  
* Part 4:  
I'm going to quote in it's entirety Part 4 -- this is all Rusty's commentary: 
"The key revelation of the paper is that we can have a network of arbitrarily complicated transactions, such that they aren’t on the blockchain (and thus are fast, cheap and extremely scalable), but at every point are ready to be dropped onto the blockchain for resolution if there’s a problem.  This is genuinely revolutionary.
It also vindicates Satoshi’s insistence on the generality of the Bitcoin scripting system.  And though it’s long been suggested that bitcoin would become a clearing system on which genuine microtransactions would be layered, it was unclear that we were so close to having such a system in bitcoin already.
Note that the scheme requires some solution to malleability to allow chains of transactions to be built (this is a common theme, so likely to be mitigated in a future soft fork), but Gregory Maxwell points out that it also wants selective malleability, so transactions can be replaced without invalidating the HTLCs which are spending their outputs.  Thus it proposes new signature flags, which will require active debate, analysis and another soft fork.
There is much more to discover in the paper itself: recommendations for lightning network routing, the node charging model, a risk summary, the specifics of the softfork changes, and more.
I’ll leave you with a brief list of requirements to make Lightning Networks a reality:
* A soft-fork is required, to protect against malleability and to allow new signature modes.
* A new peer-to-peer protocol needs to be designed for the lightning network, including routing.
* Blame and rating systems are needed for lightning network nodes.  You don’t have to trust them, but it sucks if they go down as your money is probably stuck until the timeout.
* More refinements (eg. relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) to simplify and tighten timeout times.
* Wallets need to learn to use this, with UI handling of things like timeouts and fallbacks to the bitcoin network (sorry, your transaction failed, you’ll get your money back in N days).
* You need to be online every 40 days to check that an old HTLC hasn’t leaked, which will require some alternate solution for occasional users (shut down channel, have some third party, etc).
* A server implementation needs to be written.
That’s a lot of work!  But it’s all simply engineering from here, just as bitcoin was once the paper was released.  I look forward to seeing it happen (and I’m confident it will)."

There's an argument that money has a float time, the time between being taken in trade for one thing and then spent. If you don't need to hold money for very long, that should reduce the value of the money as a store of value. There's a formula for it. Essentially as the velocity of money goes up, the price of it is going down. But that's okay. If money is so useful that it has a high velocity, the base value of a unit of it is going to be pretty high.
And most of us expect anyway that despite all the convenience of spending bitcoin, there are also countervailing aspects (a slowing rate of supply) that make holding a good idea too.

If you want to open the can of worms in a more roundabout way, ask them what they think of the Blockbuster versus Netflix situation.
One read is that Blockbuster was dumb to not buy Netflix when they had the chance.
Another read is that the investors pay for a steady business doing what they were doing (Blockbuster). And if investors believe in a different idea (Netflix) then they invest in that. So maybe Blockbuster management did the right thing running their business as they were.
So maybe ask, what are the costs of staying innovative, and what are some of the new profitable things our company could do and how could we either build or buy some of that innovation? 
Eventually, if you're talking finance and innovation, cryptocurrencies will come up as a topic, and then it's a question of what problem they solve in finance (and it's looking good for remittance and settlement - but only very small scale settlement. How could you make it scale? Example problem - I don't think you could realistically settle a billion dollar debt or purchase with bitcoin unless you spread it way out over time).

I think what you want to do is download from bitcoincore.org and use Android NDK to compile it. What I dont know is whether or not that's all in there, or if you have to use another project like greenaddress which I think is some kind of wrapper or set of patches to bitcoin core.
Ideally, you use only code from bitcoincore, then what you get is a node running on Android. I Think it will have no gui. You have to then use an Android wallet to connect to the node and give you a nice gui.
That's the idea anyway. If I was experimenting, I would try using BlueStacks to emulate an Android while I played around.

All correct, and if you have any leverage (loans) in your life at all, and you buy bitcoin with cash, you're still leveraged.
Who cares that this guy took a HELOC a took value out of his house to buy bitcoin? Good for him that it paid off. For me, I have home loan, some credit cards, a great income, a little bit of studen loan debt, no car loan, lots of home equity, cash, but for *me* the right decision was to only ever buy bitcoin with spare money. To some degree that was leveraged against paying off the credit cards more aggressively. I've done okay. For my gal, she stacks cash, and doesn't like speculating at all. But I have investments, retirement funds, all kinds of resources. I made a balance of it go towards crypto. It's, like I said, done pretty well.

Maybe... the house just has to appreciate in value faster than the money deflates.

You'd think people would be blinded by greed, but cutting the rewards shows that a person is willing to sign on to something unpredictable, which is not what owners of the item have signed on for. Sorry, that would not be bitcoin. I don't even think we're interested in smoothing out the halving. (I know I'm not) The every four years (number of blocks actually) is fine. It's predictable and it's settled. Stop changing our bitcoin.

There's always sites out there offering you some return. One site does 3%, another would do 10%, another 30%, at some number, like 100% daily you say "hey, obvious scam". But then why do you lower the number to 30% "scam", 10% "scam", on down. At some point you saw 3% and thought "legit". Why? Not your keys, not your bitcoin. At somepoint you will lose 100% of it by lending it. It's probably already gone. Get your bitcoin out while you can.

You could have the ATM decide how much cash it wants to have inside at any moment and adjust how much it pays for bitcoin on that. 
If it doesn't have enough cash, give a good price to sell bitcoin (and get cash from people).
If it has too much cash, give a good price to buy bitcoin (and get bitcoin, and give them the cash)
Keep some percentages upwards, depending on your economy. If your economy is dollars, maybe try to grow using that as the unit of account. If your account is really inflationary like IRR, then use bitcoin as the unit of account (or make up a rate of exchange). Interesting!

In Greece they will probably honor the pensions but the social services might suffer.

They are afraid of Turkey (another NATO member).

Mmmm maybe the hacker who is stress testing bitcoin is trying to split the community by giving to good causes.
Like when a mafioso gives a big donation to a hospital. It's still blood money.
Or they do genuinely mean well for bitcoin and for their causes, and they're just trying to make a point. Even if it's a painful one, about? (not sure, fees? a small blocksize? how annoying similarly spammy things like SatoshiDice are? the expense of a mempool? trying to drive centralization? trying to make us react against them and save us from centralization?)
Because they're doing this anonymously we really don't know their motives.
At least V (from V for Victory) would get on and make some anonymous speeches or something, clue us into the motive...
The early ones who did this, they did it as an open fish-or-cut-bait test of bitcoin. Like, that which does not kill you makes you stronger, in ethos.

Yep that's right, if you're a node, you are deciding what transactions are valid. It doesn't really matter how much Proof of Work is behind whatever. If YOU decide that only bitcoin transactions with blocks that follow your favorite rules are valid, then there you are. As a practical reality, it's the whole bitcoin network, together, where 90%+ decide what's valid basically, -- miners, exchanges, users, merchants, etc, what we all decide together is bitcoin and what's valid, that's where the value is, and the consensus holds it all together.
If you alone with your node, have rules that are incredibly unique to you, a network of self-bitcoin will have probably low value. But the one that most everyone agrees is bitcoin, that one has the value.

Good wallets will have "seed words" - 12 or 24 odd words that they ask you to write down.
You can take those pieces and protect them from fire by pounding them into steel, or putting them in a fireproof box.
You can protect the seed words by writing them in pen or paper and don't let them touch a computer.
You can split the secret words up by using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS) - a generic way to cut things into pieces.
You can legally share your key with a lawyer, and tell them to hold part. They could steal from you, but the law would be on your side.
You can protect the signing of messages by using a two-factor devices like a Trezor, Keepkey, or Ledger hardware wallet.
Trezor's I know have decoy wallets, so if someone forces you to reveal what you have, you can show them some last amount you just got, etc.
Use only small amounts on mobile phones.
If you want to protect your privacy, don't use coinbase.com, buy via localbitcoins. 
Other coins are more private but bitcoin is the biggy.

Because it's about sending a Message, it was never about the money.
That's when the whole economy shudders and stops because it can't go on unless we run a non-stop printing press and hold inflationary money on people like a whip.

Right after Electrum SPV wallets went and got hacked
Yikes, Electrum SPV makes it really clear you have to use a full node or get a better design for wallets, like have the wallets connect to trustworthy wallet nodes, use better hardware than your phone to sign , etc.
Not that Electrum isn't trying and that their devs are working hard - they are, and it's not all their fault, but that has turned out to be one of the latest weak spots.

If you haven't heard the legend, there was something similar in Asia about golden buddhas left in lonely places like hillsides and people would slowly discover them over time. Oh of course I can't think of what to google so you can find out more, but my impression was people would find solid gold buddhas out in the countryside and they would be small, but heavy, about 5kg in weight probably, which is pretty big for solid gold. But the treasure of course is more metaphorical. Eg, having something to meditate on.

No the concept of money laundering is financial thought crime.
People have used money for centuries and face to face exchanged it.
Because of the rise of the telegraph and banks, we have networks to communicate the transfer of value.

So financial freedom is important as a check on the powerful.

Well very true, especially if you simplify it down to:
* Digital Collectible
* &lt;---we are here
* *Reliable* Store of Value
* *Widespread* Medium of Exchange
* *Convenient* Unit of Account
* Full Global Money
I mean, that's okay.
For each:
* *Reliable* Store of Value -- it's reliable, but there's still a lot of mistakes and hacks, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin is still true, but people are using as the unit of account something else (like dollars) so the Store of Value is stuck in a bit of a chicken or egg phenomenon. But it's coming, and things like LN force people to stake
* *Widespread* Medium of Exchange -- once it's around and layer two things like LN, are as common as a PayPal button out there on e-Commerce, that'd be enough. It has a chance of getting there
* *Convenient* Unit of Account -- right now it seems that only the most die hard bitcoiners care about bitcoin units as the actual unit of account (As in, do you have a full bitcoin, or 21 bitcoin etc); and for trading altcoins where you might measure their price in BTC. And since you're going between alts, it makes a lot of sense to compare them to each other in those terms, since that's what you'r'e trading.
* Full Global Money --  this is if bitcoin gets chosen instead of Special Drawing Rights from the IMF. Hehehehe, that will be a fun day if it ever happens :)   You can pretty much expect commando raids on your house if you have bitcoin and you're not a part of the ruling elite. (Like the invasion of Panama to get Daniel Noriega) So we'll see.

Eh I don't know, I'm kind of having one of those days where I hope the ETF never happens. Meh. They don't bring the right kind of people to bitcoin. This is about the politics of money, not just getting rich in dollar terms.
We only need linear adoption gains in order to see exponential value of bitcoin gains. (The network effect: as n, the number of users, rises, the n\^2, number of connections possible, which drives value goes up way faster)
So let's not be too into ETF. They will show up whenever they want to. They are fundamentally latecoiners. I am fine with them being dragged in. No easy path is fine by me.

I think it depends on whether or not you see yourself as a financially curious person.
I was invested in the stock market already and had spare funds to try things out, so I tried out bitcoin, lending club, kiva, and something else I forget. They were all different, kiva isn't for making money, just making small loans.
Lending club didn't do as well as I'd hoped :/
But bitcoin did great :)
And over time, bitcoin actually changed my own internal values a lot more than the other things.
I definitely got a lot more grit and determination. So it helped a lot.
I saw bitcoin as almost like a mathematical curiousity too, and mathematics is something I'm not great at, but am usually pretty curious about. (I think it's taught super badly, in general, but you can find some good resources out there...)
Any other coins I'm into, it's because I was curious how they worked.

Yes, bitcoin only works if there's no collusion or power to run the 51% attack.
The closest to ideal case is to have thousands of little 1% slices all competing flat out for the prize. 
Next best though is for there to be some fairly large pools for users to shift their hash power between, some pools around 20%, 15%, 10%, and fading downwards from there. (To reduce variance for the pool members' payout).

I liked the comment from the Chinese commenter:
\&gt; 1. If BFX is highly cash flow positive, why borrowed from Tether?
\&gt; 2. If the $850m can be easily crawled back, why IEO?
\&gt; 3. If BFX really dosent’t give a f of NYAG (not criminal charges yet) why bother doing all these
1. If the USD gets seized, how does the company keep going, did they just borrow from Tether in order to move money from the company that gets assets seized (the payment processor) over to somewhere in Hong Kong (Tether) so they don't get screwed again? Makes some sense. It's a debit/loan on one side, and a credit/balance on the other. Keeps the funds safer - maybe.
2. Maybe the $850m can be crawled back, but the NY AG just made it sound like they were unhappy that TETHER didn't have their Tethers backed 1:1. Turns out the payment processor had the money. Fine, this moves the ledger entries around, happy?
3. The NY AG is the part of the government, just one of the tentacles, taking action against Tether / bitfinex. They hate foreign exchanges, they want to see bitcoin die. Individually at the NY AG, they may feel like they are enforcing the law. As individuals though they are just tools. Other parts of the government are seizing assets willy nilly. The left hand writes threatening letters, the right hand seizes your funds. The government is trying to shut down bitcoin exchanges that don't play by Bitlicense like rules and central control. PROBABLY in the long run, exchanges can't win, since the USD is their fiat currency and they make up all the rules about how it works.
I don't care if bitfinex lives or dies, or if Tether is or isn't a fractional reserve. Tether is clearly useful to turn dollars into Tethers, and then Tethers into bitcoin. Go that direction. Then get your bitcoin off the exchanges. Your bitcoin is harder to seize than USD funds.
USD isn't "Backed" by anything, but it's this huge problem that Tether is or isn't?? Just get bitcoin and be done with this.

Yeah but if you allow the PoW algorithms to work on common machines CPUs and RAM then what you wind up building is 'botnet coin'
A step better is to use Graphics cards / GPUs, something that (in its own realm of prgramming) is like an ASIC. Do something that only GPUs truly do well, and with a lot of RAM so that they're an uncommonly "good" GPU - something someone had to go out and buy and  install -- couldn't be found on a common botnet computer, and is mass-market enough that normal people can participate.
Next, make it so that there is some incentive to literally spread out across the surface of the Earth - something where you have more than 100 different locales that are 'ideal' and offer a small coinbase bonus if you're mining from a locale that hasn't been mined from lately. Maybe a longitude/latitude, but coarsely - almost enough to identify a small country but not quite. Maybe instead of a higher coinbase reward, a faster reward, like instead of 100 blocks, make it so that the normal coinbase matures in 1000 blocks, but proof of location could give you a payout in 100 blocks. So it's not a crisis if it's imperfect but a nice goal. ( )
Next have the Proof of Work function require hopefully ever rising RAM and GPU requirements so that solutions done with top gear have a good chance of being paid out.

It would be nice if E\*trade let you do deposits or withdrawls in bitcoin, then use the market USD value to buy and trade stocks.
Rather than "trade" bitcoin. It just has to be a funding mechanism and then let you sell your stock for bitcoin, or buy stock with bitcoin.
Then peg the bitcoin value to somewhere, maybe Coinbase, maybe Gemini, and not overthink it.
I would rather it be like that, rather than how I think eToro did it. They're a different kind of site. Because they're european in flavor, they allow contracts for difference (CFD) which I don't think is allowed on a US trading site. CFD seems more like "betting". 
I would prefer that E\*trade not allow betting on the price of bitcoin, but just allow people to directly buy and sell using it.

Probably this story except:
1. the Feds find a way to seize the money or stop it in or out of Panama
2. Bitfinex and Tether does not die (NY AG surprised Pikachu face)
3. fine, NY AG sues Bitfinex and calls them an insolvent scam
my bets for step 4)
4a) Bitfinex ignores them and sets up new banking
4b) They make a new Tether, like Tethered Euros, and makes EURT (yurt) - this step sweeps the legs out from under USD bosses.
4bb) And somewhere in the world, a pure FOREX shop sets up that only works in stablecoins and the various currencies. Something like OANDA, but working in total stablecoins, to and from.
4c) somewhere like Kraken takes up EURT
4d) Bitfinex issues insolvency tokens or bonds
4e) brief problems
4f) life goes on
4g) NY AG fumes as bitcoin moons again
We can't do anything about the fact that USD are political dollars and mostly digital ones. They is still cash, so you could do exotic envelopes full of cash for Tether, and no one could easily stop that.
But for the most part USD can be seized and then the govt can call you insolvent.
Similar to arresting criminals (or just people you don't like), seizing their bank accounts or their assets, then laughing when they cant hire a lawyer because they have no funds.
Why is bitfinex getting all the hate? Probably they don't play ball with Law Enforcement requests.

You've hit on it. Hashing the public key gives us all a one way function to look at until you've spent the coins. It's a different algorithm too (like SHA256 over the top of RIPEMD160 or the otherway around I forget)  
So cracking a cold bitcoin address looks hard to stop. If someone tries, they are going to do it to a wallet with a lot of coins. Once they do it to enough wallets, the alarm will be sounded. Then people will switch to another set of algos for bitcoin addresses, and there will be varying degrees of vulnerable legacy addresses and then whatever new format we use.

Bitfinex isn't a criminal enterprise.
Bitfinex is both stupid and clever. Stupid because they are a huge target. Clever because they thought up Tether.
They should have added a FOREX company into the mix.
One to do USD, EUR, RUR etc to and from a FOREX company that trades in stablecoins, and that's all it does. Like OANDA but with the usual forex pairs and stablecoins. (Probably start with an existing FOREX site, and add stablecoins to it)
Then from there, allow only stablecoins in and out to Bitfinex, and/or bitcoin withdrawls.

In a freer market, there would be more doctors and better processes to do it inexpensively.
As it is, people are all tied up in healthcare tied to their employer. Hopefully someday that can change, and if we can vastly increase the available supply of doctors (and surgeons) and make running a hospital in general less of an expensive situation, then prices can fall.
Right now, people individually have little reason to be good at negotiating.
Insurance companies lobby and negotiate to get better deals than the uninsured. So the prices you see are usually the prices that the uninsured are paying.

Yes in a system with network effects, you only need a linear increase in adoption over time to get exponential value gains.

Yeah I think I would call it a speculation now, back then I thought slightly differently about crypto.
Just like real estate speculation. It's just something people throw money at but it's not an investment. (Well people think real estate is an investment but that depends. Like, do you buy land, build a house on it, and then turn a profit, then that would be investment. But if you just buy a house, put no effort into it, and hope it goes up in price, that's speculation.)
But you have to have some speculations since you need uncorrelated high risk / high return plays.

Pretend you had 400 million dollars in digital IOUs at a bank.
You are a bank or a big company and you have funds, but ...
You are looking at a bleak economy and literally nothing is worth investing in. Everything is set to drop.
So you think I'll keep this at the central bank. Fine, the central bank wants to charge you a small fee to keep the money, maybe 1% annually. That's a -1% rate.
So you think, blech, I don't want to invest, and I don't want to pay 4,000,000 a year just to park money. I know, I'll cash it out as 100 dollar bills in stacks, and store the money in a $4m dollar vault. That's at least not worse, and after a year it's paid for itself. That's a good investment.
The central bank goes cashless. You cannot get cash, and you can't turn cash in.
Now they make you buy investments. You look around and it's nothing but LA riots, yellow vests, and ne'er do wells all over the place. Plus many businesses are total scams, and you can't even trust a 10Q filing anymore. You get ripped off left and right, and you don't want to invest until this shit show goes down and some people go bankrupt and you can invest and get a good deal on a fire sale.
Well no, the Central Banks work for the government and jobless unhappy voters is the last thing they want. They WILL create make work programs to keep these idiots busy at "work" and fed "food".  So they create shit-tons of service jobs, like girl gamers streaming PUBG and make sure that cheap food based on trash is readily available like Mt Dew and Doritos. (Maybe you love those things, that's okay, they're great).
But the main thing is to keep the voters placated. But there's no business climate here. Except there is -- it's very strange but some businesses like SpaceX, Facebook, Google, they are just killing it. Other businesses, it's no bueno.
And you have a culture just coming apart at the seams. The Western world doesn't believe in itself, doesn't believe in much of anything. It's very sad.
This is all related.
The negative interest rates are there to make banks dump cash on the fire.

Unrelenting Statists for sure
What Assange / Wikileaks did is certainly legally debatable, and I think if Assange was more brave would realize that he shouldn't expect to put his face on a movement and then not get his chance at a trial to reach even more people. It's okay to be arrested and punished by an immoral system (don't expect any fairness though, it's a show)  
Like if Assange was fighting slavery or something. He should be proud to be put in prison fighting for what he thinks is right.
But dang, just wholly letting the US Govt off the hook for the shit they hid from all of us, to evade justice.

Chain analysis is when people use tools to analyze the blockchain. What they are doing is making it so that bitcoins become less fungible. Fungibility is the property of money that makes it so that you can't discriminate on where the money came from. If you can take the history of a money and use that against taking it for payments, then you hurt the value of money.
In this case, the fact that bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous instead of being anonymous, is hurting bitcoin.

Yeah making it so that Tether can't get you out of Bitfinex just makes the price of bitcoin go higher on that exchange, because that's the way out.

Only if everyone redeems Tethers for dollars, otherwise I guess they are saying that they are floating on a fractional reserve.
Probably market participants would be rational to "sell" Tethers and buy bitcoin, or to redeem Tethers for dollars, down until the are 100% backed again (whatever, not really sure you could ever \*know\* they were ... as it needs audits etc)
And/or Tethers should be destroyed and/or not actually issued or \*something\* if they are still held by the company. Otherwise, how does it come into balance.

That'd be a funner reply. They should stop allowing US users and switch Tether away from being denominated in USD. Make it denominated in EUR. Just overnight, switch it to the other currency. And if they don't like that, switch it to Swiss Francs.
Just tell the US, your laws don't apply here fuck off.

Hard to know what this is
A) this could be exchanges all selling to individual high net worth individuals who have listened, understand, and are taking their bitcoin off and into safe cold storage
B) same as above, but these are heading out to new Lightning Nodes and will act as like super payment systems of the future
C) this is one or a small number of whales arbitraging between exchanges (moving bitcoin from here to there, selling, then outside this moving dollars/euros/yen, and rapidly rinsing and repeating via something like Tether, and then doing it all over again, rapidly).
See, we can't really tell. It's not meaningless but from this I can't tell what it is.

dang, Thailand is really thugging it up by taking away something that might be in international waters, right off their shores.
Maybe these people should have just used a boat thing, registered somewhere, and then dropped anchor in international waters.
I have a feeling that the shape of the object, and the politics around it (seasteading) are what caused the Thai govt reaction.
Maybe if they were an oceanographic survey vessel, US or panama flagged, and right outside their waters, and/or not doing any research, they'd have been fine.

People pay to get their altcoins listed.
A lot of them are pump and dumps, ways to enrich the owner / creators.
I don't know, I mean, this is other coins. I thought IOTA was one example, with Tangle, that doesn't work but made people fantastically rich. What, does it not even have a distributed database, I forget.
Or like, why is Ripple listed, etc.
So I kind of agree with you, but that's well not the wavelength exchanges are thinking on. They get fees from listing lots of coins, and letting people trade.

So after their payment processor got kneecapped for almost a billion dollars ($850 mil) - that they claim the US, Poland and Portugal seized, they borrowed $600 million from them so they could make payouts and keep things floating, and they still are 75% backed?
That's kind of interesting, since it sounds like Tether is moving the goalposts. Or the NY AG is assuming that Tethers are supposed to be backed 1:1 by USD, which Tether controls, and not their payment processor.
I have a feeling that the USG Powers That Be, are pissed that they seized the currency and Tether / bitfinex didn't just go die..
Didn't Tether suggest that Tethers were supposed to be backed 1:1 by USD -- or didn't that change over time in their terms of service or something.

Houses will become smaller and they will generally be more bespoke and handmade to buyer's specifications, and potentially built out over longer time periods.
Some things like land will still be valuable and worth lending on, if the buyer has plans to develop it. 
The kinds of builders that succeed in today's world of financing are going to go through a rough patch because people won't be interested in tract housing built by Quadrant. 
So the winners in the future are those who figure out which people have the deflationary currency and what they want. And they will make them something specific, so that might be a Lindal Cedar Home, or a geodesic dome house, or a skyscraper in the middle of a city.

Tether FUD is nonstop. No one is being ripped off. You are all paranoid.
The only thing corrupt here is the NY BitLicense and other trash.

In the bizarre world of bitcoin, if you can't get dollars out, but you can get bitcoin out by buying them with exchange IOUs, then you can send bitcoin out, then demand for bitcoin on that exchange rises, the price of bitcoin rises.
Fools with bitcoin on other exchanges bring their bitcoin in, hoping to sell for dollars and get trapped.

Yeah but this is another Statist "heads I win, tails you lose" situation for Bitfinex.
One hand of the state is seizing the USD funds, while the other hand is the NY AG scratching it's head thinking "hey why didn't they go bankrupt?"
If they go bankrupt, the State wins.
(Ultimately, it's their dollars though, so they will do their best to make their rules apply to their fiat, they have a whole huge system of enforcement)
When bitcoin gets harder to turn into cash, then for a little while, bitcoin goes up in price.
Gains in price make it gain value.
I'm not defending Bitfinex the exchange or whoever runs it. Just get your USD to USDT, buy bitcoin, and get out.

They are crimes too. Crimes Manning committed.
Julian Assange / Wikileaks is like a guerilla journalist. He's not a traditional journalist, but it's still news. So I think it's fair game.
Plus the real crime is in the materials that were covered up.
Manning should have been covered under whistleblower protection. He really should have gone to a sympathetic Senator for protection. Like changed home state to some Senator they liked that had a shred of integrity (at the time, that might be ... McCain or Sanders? depends on your politics) -- so I do think Manning made a mistake leaking this to someone overseas. There are processes in the US, but you have to make the right leaks to the right people.
Or leak it to the NY Times, Washington Post, whichever leaked the Pentagon Papers. Just collect it, and leak it over the next 10 years, leave the service so they can't find the leak, etc etc.
It is morally correct to leak evidence of crime, classified documents is an adminstrative thing, and stealing is a legal offense. You could argue that copyright infringement is not theft, making a copy of a document did not steal it, and that "classified data" is an administrative protection, not a legal one. Etc. Have fun with lawyers etc. Manning should have been way more careful and not leaked to an egomaniac but there you go.

Isn't there a Catch-22 here where if one part of the government seizes all your assets, then you are insolvent, so you must shut down because of some seizure you can't contest?
Don't you need a court ordered levy on a bank account to lose the funds? ... and that should give you your day in court, unless there is that same old crazy account / asset confiscation trick the USG uses (like suing a pile of cash, or suing a car)
Otherwise, even if they're seized and you can't move the funds around, they're still your businesses funds until a court levy (judgement, whatever, not sure of the term)

At coinmarketcap.com, the bitcoin dominance is about 65% which is kind of low. That means a lot of rise in "market cap" value is happening in altcoins lately. 
So if bitcoin was at about $1600 you'd be seeing MOON and high fives.

He found a clever way to use a message Satoshi signed, to reuse the signing somehow to I think trick Gavin Andreesen and maybe others, into thinking he had the private key.
So the strange thing is, it's easier than this. Just move some bitcoin from a block under like 1000 and I would be satisfied.
Someone could be Satoshi and have lost their keys, so I am open to that possibility. But there just seems to be holes in his story, and the counter-proof that he's Satoshi should be easy for him to do.
Like if the court said, take any block under  tells us the block number, then move 0.42424242 (or some made up amount)
I would think it's on Craig Wright to prove he's Satoshi (an anonymous disappeared person), rather than on everyone else to kowtow and let him prance around pretending.

I don't know enough about this,..
DO smart contracts create new transactions, if you have a miner that cares to run them, it makes new transactions and they can be paid in miner's fees or something?
Like, say A makes a smart contract to pay B on some condition (to most miners just looks like some script, but they dont care, mine it, get their reward) - now it's mined and passively in the blockchain. Miner is C.
Some other group, D, has a node, keeps some data, and is looking all the time for scripts to run. They find one that met some conditions (cool), they run the script, something happens, and for running it, they play a new transaction that fulfills some condition of the script. The script pays them a little, pays the miner a little, and funds move from A to B in some complex way? 
Is that how this works?

Before you start, decide right at the beginning if you want to be anonymous or not.

Increasing the difficulty, making any of it harder to get, results in a payoff to miners in other places, lowers the supply they need to sell since profits are up, lowering the velocity of money. Lower velocity is higher price.
Alternatively, maybe Chinese miners totally give up on bitcoin, dump their bitcoin, increase the supply for sale, drop prices? 
I think the first scenario is more likely. Not selling, forced to shut down, is a payday to everyone else, since it doesn't reduce demand but reduces supply and the pace that transactions will get mined, at least for a little while. Slowing the hash rate required to mine at a profit, means more profit. Doesn't mean miners will sell more, means they will sell less.

But okay. 
Next, the article has an interesting link to a lady on Twitter that got deplatformed all over the place - Amazon, Square, Coinbase, Paypal, etc. Apparently it's because she writes about sex?
Deplatforming is one thing, and people have their minds up about that. Free speech vs not having the right to make someone host your ideas. Ok.
But financial censorship cuts just as deep. You write something some Puritan doesn't agree with, and now you don't get money? Financial liberation and privacy is important, and this is the kind of person, regardless of the left/right politics of it all, that deserves (actually we ALL deserve) and have I think an inalienable right to be able to handle finances.

I get that two wrongs don't make a right. Maybe the hacker should still see some justice.
But SO SHOULD EQUIFAX's people. Especially if some of them were covering things up!
And it's not at all clear that a leaking group that receives the info and leaks this evidence of crime should have to go to jail, even if they encourage people to be "hackers" or whistleblowers.
They're a step removed from journalists sure, but they are like guerilla journalists / muckrakers / rabblerousers.
The rabblerousers are making the powerful (and insulated from consequences) - feel the consequences and they have set the dogs on him. Okay fine.
I get also ,that Wikileaks seemed to change in character over time. It was first more anti-US than anti-Russia (interesting), then during the election it was definitely pro-Trump and anti-Clinton, and coordinating to hurt our elections fairness. 
And possibly Assange was a disgusting rapist.
I am not trying to call this guy a saint, he's obviously a narcissist of some kind. But I have some sympathy for the early releases that Wikileaks did.
I am also though not surprised that it looks like Russia helped them later (Guccifer and email hacks etc - carrots), and probably threatened them (they are known to kill journalists and ex-spies - stick).
So be that as it may.. That's how I see it. I respect your point of view and I think I understand it.
I think Assange should just have been brave and gone to the US. We might not even have a decent basis in law to try him. He should have gone EARLY in the process, before Russia got him.

No I always thought the hysteria about how much resources it takes to run a node were overblown.
Just the same, you could probably run a bitcoin node on a Samsung Galaxy S10 right now (a very modern cell phone). 
There is all reasons to believe that someday you may easily have a node in your pocket running on a small mobile computer. No need for SPV wallets. And then use LN to pay for things. 
I think the layer 1 settlement, layer 2 payments and smart contracts way forward is going to be the smarter way.
I say that because bcash is trying to do settlements and payments and eventually will not scale. I say that because Ethereum is trying to do smart contracts and is going to struggle with market value vs cost of nodes vs security vs the crazy world of smart contracts.  
It's not that bcash and Ethereum can't succeed - they will probably be fine, just that long run, they may realize what bitcoin is doing .... might be the stronger way to do it. With layers on layers.

I have seen some really stupid things done in datacenters in my time
Assumptions like taking a laptop, most of their power bricks are rated 110-220, and have a 110 volt "NEMA 5-15P to IEC 60320 C13" on a laptops brick, and if you look closely at it it says its rated for 110. They replaced that with the female version on the 5-15 end, and plugged a 220 volt outlet to mains like a power strip. It burned out the power supply. They think the problem is that someone brought in a 110, not that they're using NEMA 5. (ALL NEMA 5 ARE FOR 110V)
They're fucking idiots and someday that datacenter will burn down because of it, but there's nothing I can do to wake people up.
Again, most laptops nowadays are 220 volt rated as well on their powersupply. So it "works" what they're doing but it's wrong. Datacenter fires are definitely always a risk.

Since I agree with aaj094, bitcoin is now more useful than doge, which is garbage.
The money is a bit arbitrary, but the first crypto, bitcoin, will stand out as a natural first choice. It's like meeting a friend at Grand Central Station in New York at noon. It stands out as the most arbitrary useful starting point in crypto, and will probably be the best general money. I see some role for a super private coin like Monero (maybe an atomic swap sidechain MimbleWimble, who knows), and maybe (not as money) some utility to Ethereum, but most of the rest, meh.

Yeah, the FUD cranks into high gear. After China bans crypto x10 and no one cares. This time they are probably patting themselves on the back about how great an idea it is to make getting into and out of markets super hard. Making blocks fill up backfired because the velocity of money slowed in bitcoin ... which increased bitcoin's value (oops!)  Whatever they just hit bitcoin with, is much more effective. Kind of a multiprong of Tether FUD, and goofy market stuff. Anyway, still doesn't dawn on a lot of people that you never need to sell, just buy and use crypto day to day, end the connection. It's a darn shortcoming, because long term the price in dollars doesn't matter, but in the short term before universal adoption, the dollar/euro/yen price still matters.

Unless you're thinking of some interesting massive "web of trust" style system where we sign each other's messages (for free), and then ... we have to prevent replay attacks ... etc. Proof of Stake, but then you have the nothing at stake problem. No one is really spending resources, so I'll make and hype another coin. The making and hyping of coins (like the fork-fork-fork drama) or all the altcoins that aren't proof of work wind up being infinite compared to the total amount of finite energy going into Proof of Work coins. And besides merge-mining, more or less if you mine one coin you are not mining another. Meaning it forces choices. Eventually there should only be one main (or group of merge-mined) Proof of Work coins and that puts us back to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:25:27
Eh the FUD gets hard to counter. They just see the value in the dollar value for bitcoin. So it's hard to refute whatever the current market thinks the price is. 
Just that bitcoin seems to trade in about a multiple of 10 range, so like 20k to 2k, any price is possible at the market. But the idea that it is slowly sliding the bottom of the range and the top of the range up as time goes forward is lost on them. 
Give it four years and none of the price action right now will seem to matter.

I'm looking for censorship and surveillance resistance, really good fungibility, some interesting ways to both resist forks (or make it so that forks can't replay somehow), and maybe a two-way peg to bitcoin and a way to send and receive 100% anonymously. If you have a way that we can also turn it two ways into and from fiat banknotes to the crypto, and totally avoid centralized exchanges and banks, that would be amazing.

Yes bubbles can happen whenever people think that prices will inevitably go up. Plus people can be really creative about preserving their value, like using land use restrictions, height and density restrictions etc, in order to make their house values go up. Plus ordinary people are kind of empowered to make improvements to their house, but in contrast, what can they really do to improve a company's stock?
I'm just saying that houses themselves depreciate, they just do. If people want to speculate or manipulate land values, they're going to do that. They do that in a lot of ways. Also the US government goes to a lot of trouble to keep house prices propped up.

But my beef with it is that it's a junk centralized shitcoin that doesn't even need to exist and is not core to their dumb business, and the entire supply is trash.

Personally, I think jstolfi just is massively overthinking bitcoin.
As a database of record, how bitcoin solved the problem of having the record rewritten with a fake history and being able to prove it to others that know some part of the recent past (last hour, last day, it's not very well defined) -- you could prove through proof of work that it's pretty likely to be "true" as long as the amount of work going into that looked like the amount of work needed to get other recent values...
Anyway, after that, bitcoin as a "currency" is intriguing. In that the inventor(s) deliberately wanted to base it on gold, posted notes in chain about banks, etc ... chose to make a disinflationary issuing schedule, internal to the system itself without regard to outside demands for money....  based on a lot of interesting economic beliefs that go together as a system. That's a whole 'nother set aside ....
Then as a currency the thing is a hell of a lot more complicated than it needed to be just to move values around ... lo and behold it's also a scripting system. But not a Turing-complete one... and then there's that rabbit hole. Why didn't the author pick a provably secure language? But anyway... limited knowledge of the author? Not everyone who writes code is a computer scientist, or a scientist with vast access to the literature. But .... the writing style and the LaTeX layout of the original paper scream academia -- graduate student? 
Then, as the original cryptocurrency experiment, it probably had the fairest emission system you could come up with. People have tried others, and a ton of altcoins are just scams where they secretly mine in the background, release broken and inefficient mining clients, etc. 
There's all kinds of history about how Satoshi did not anticipate how quickly bitcoin would go from CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASIC. Etc!
I personally think that bitcoin should have maybe chosen something a LOT longer like a 10-20 or 40 year halving period, so that you could join in anytime and the early lead by early adopters would not be as much of a barrier. 
And also, 21 million coins looks very small. (Isn't because it's divisible, and there are reasons, but ..) he should have made 21 million x 21 million  = 441,000,000,000,000) so that everyone on earth (7 billion?) could have something like 20,000 coins.  
Anyway, bitcoin's not a "scam" but you could see it as a kind of crypto-libertarian slush fund. Created from nothing, buy into it if you want to. No one's holding a gun to your head. Don't ruin yourself by buying a lot and then having it all crash. Don't spend what you can't afford ... etc other than that. It's just a really neat technology.

Other people could provide those things.
I would switch to a real estate tax, and then also set up a system where the public can eminent domain at lot of each other's lands if you're willing to pay eye-watering high prices on the other person's property.
Each person decides their own property value, with the understanding that if someone else pays a multiple of their real estate taxes (and sets a new implied value) that if you don't contest that and pay your fair share, they have the option to buy your land.
Houses might get a small exemption.
Soon nobody wants to own anything. A lot of land would become parks, reserves, wetlands, fields, etc. People would try to own as little land as possible - if they don't need it for production.

It's just FUD.
You can encode small amounts of information into bitcoin in OP_RETURN, dust, vanity addresses, maybe other ways, and yet it still takes an algorithm and key information to extract it.
You could encode images into DNS if you wanted.
You could post 1000 images of noise to imgur but make the XOR of two of them and a password result in porn. 
You could post normal looking pictures to Facebook, take 1 bit of randomness every 256 bytes, XOR with noise.. Decrypt ... Yadda yadda ...
This is all pure FUD

If you start with bitcoin on a high volume but kind of dodgy exchange, and you want dollars: trade to a stablecoin so that they aren't in another crypto that might move down with the rest of a market's move down. Then they use the Tether to get to another exchange where the Tether there can be sold for fiat and actually get them their money.

The kinds of thinking that would break SHA-256 would be incredible. A lot of secret communications could no longer happen over wi-fi, nor even be safe over fiber optics. The world might struggle for a while, high value things couldn't go over the Internet. We'd be back to the days of the Pony Express for important messages. Uh, things would be screwed, and bitcoin would not be the biggest topic. People would still use the Internet but it would be very disruptive. In bitcoin, maybe there's a chance we'd switch to something else. Or not, depends on how bad the break is.

Yeah I definitely now see the difference between fragile, robust, and antifragile and I see how tiny stress and low-level FUD against both bitcoin and the main fiat system benefit bitcoin.
That makes bitcoin antifragile and it's the first I ever really understood the term.
I needed this metaphor:
If you had a box marked fragile (maybe it contains glassware) you understand that it's fragile and things inside break if you toss the box hard.
If it's marked 'antifragile' a lot of people would think of something that's tough or durable but that's not what it is.
A B-17 bomber is robust - it takes a lot of damage but flies home. But it's not antifragile - your muscles are antifragile: you work out and you get stronger, but if you overdo it you get injured. So a bit of stress is helpful.
Bitcoin having small challenges, little attacks, but nothing HUGE, those things make it stronger and stronger. And the environment around bitcoin, if banks want to be controlling and patronizing and print money, then bitcoin gets stronger.

I hereby coin a new term: "Facts U Like" (FUL)
" from a portfolio theory perspective, bitcoin is an asset that is **non-correlated  (volatile yes, but volatility that is unrelated to fiat investments)  and therefore a true method of diversification** that boosts the  overall portfolio’s risk-reward (e.g. Sharpe, Sortino), and with plenty  of upside that is premised on secular and defensible trends. "
EDIT:  She got this part wrong --- " In the Bitcoin network, the more security you provide, the more bitcoin you’re paid, and the more say you have in the network's governance. In the Ethereum network, you get paid in ether to verify computations. Blockchain-enabled systems are merit-based, peer-to-peer marketplaces that allow humans to continue to form valuable, efficient networks without relying on legacy gatekeepers." 
Instead it should say: in the Bitcoin network the more security you provide for mining it, the greater the value to you to keep the currency valuable. Counter-intuitively, amassing a controlling stake in the mining of the network leads to the network failing in the market as people would just migrate to a fairer system. So miners are incentivized to participate but not to control the network. The value of the network is in all the people using it and openly contributing to it on a meritocratic market-based basis, free of central control, manipulation, and censorship.  Bitcoin will probably stay the biggest and most valuable cryptocurrency because of it's "immaculate conception" - no pre-mined coins, no early favoritism, and heavy idealism. That's led to it being the biggest and arguably the fairest cryptocurrency. It has it's early adopters and "whales", but none of them own so much of it that they could single-handedly destroy it or control it. Other coins always wait at the edges, attempting to find some niche where they can add value - for example in contracts, IoT, or privacy - but it's hard to imagine at this point something else replacing bitcoin when bitcoin fits the bill so well for a big online community (the entire Internet) and it has a very large ecosystem.

@_date: 2018-11-26 08:58:11
Eh... not really true.
Counterexample: stock market vs say fixed income bond market. When one side is buying or selling to the other, people are just trading - one side lowers their risks in a search for steady return, the other gives up some peace of mind to get a more random starting kick high or low in early years when the earliest years can matter a lot.
So with bitcoin, an oldcoiner selling to a newcoiner is each side trading places on the speculation. The oldcoiner just wants to enjoy something like a used Ford Taurus with the 1.0 bitcoin, and the newcoiner is looking for a moonshot.

1. Keeping the data in sync. Nodes send transactions and finished blocks to each other. Transactions go into the mempool and mined blocks are saved up and the right blockchain to believe is the one with the most proof of work
2. Full nodes would need the whole blockchain but dont worry storage prices fall over time and the current plan is to not make bitcoin blocks be very large. But that also means that bitcoin will be a settlement layer. Since bitcoin at the blocksize and rate it has cant hold the worlds tranactions, other ways to tie those to bitcoin exist. See Lightning network, side chains, atomic swaps, and other kinds of second layer scaling.
3. The sends and receives are pretty fast. In most ordinary times anything super important is settled in an hour. You can make up a new address someone can send things to anytime. It is best practice not to reuse an address. Bitcoin is not completely private. It is pseudo-anonymous. Chainanalysis is the attempt to defeat your privacy. Some addresses are tied to exchanges, dark net markets, thefts/hacks, miners, or the addresses are tied to people who gave identification called Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML). If you mined it anonymously and used newly made up addresses you are good.
4. Yes bitcoin is very decentralized. And for example, the network wouldnt die even if goon squads kicked in the door and shut ot down in China and USA.

"crypto" just means secret or hidden.
crpytography is means hidden writing.
cryptozoology is the search for legendary creatures (Bigfoot, chupacabra, the Loch Ness monster) etc.
If you have a crypto- in something it doesn't make it good or bad, it's sometimes tacked onto other words to help people understand.
If you had a word like "cryptomobile" it would be like a secret car. Cryptomobilism (just made that up) would be a way of moving around, in secret. Like cross-country travel without anyone realizing you had travelled coast-to-coast. There you go. So crypto means whatever like that.

Because when other people showed up to sell at those prices, there weren't enough passive and active buyers to sustain the price, and other people who had bet on even higher prices happening, were liquidated and forced to sell as it fell, which exaggerated the downwards prices. And other people had safety stops set to sell if the price hit a number, so that they could at least hold onto some gains.
Check out a cool site about stocks and markets - excuse the name, but it's a great site:  - it's a place to learn FOREX trading.

BCHABC was the Jihan and Ver version and I think they wanted 32 megabyte blocks, and the BCHSV version is Craig Wright and some billionaires (Ayres?) version and they wanted 128 megabyte blocks.
Both sides rented hashpower and fought over it, I think BCHABC won a hashpower race for a while, maybe the market and maybe gets to keep the BCH ticker symbol. Basically both sides burned cash on rental hashpower (and some diehards sure) to try to be ahead. But.. yeah what a mess.
Anyway, they hard fork apparently every 6 months so they get to fight over and over.
This affects bitcoin because people were selling bitcoin and other alts to get BCH pre-fork.

Weirdly, when I first heard of bitcoin,
My first impression before reading the white paper, would have been that it worked like old Monero 
(coins would be in whole units and then mixed in some clever way to obfuscate which coins are going to whom), plus something like Lightning where you would have to own a channel like thing (effectively, "stake" bitcoin, where you had to have it, like you have to have an IP address to use the Internet).
I was pretty wrong about all that, I was totally wrong, and bitcoin doesn't work anything like that (read the white paper), went "huh". And then later bought some because I thought bitcoin was interesting and had potential.

Dang, good speaker, but he missed a moment there when the oil commodity guy asked why doesn't the price fall like oil does?
The best answer is:  individually, more effort by one mining operation gets you pretty much linearly more results. BUT - collectively, all the effort, of all the miners, gives only so much bitcoin. That means, everyone working harder - if they all work harder - makes it so that you don't get a bigger share. If 10 mining outfits exist, and they all have equal hash rate, they each get about 1/10th. If they all scale up their operations 20 times, it doesn't matter. It now costs them 20x as much, but they get the same 1/10th because everyone else scaled up. Call it the most frustrating mining situation in the world.
Oil's not like that. There is effectively unlimited amounts of carbon in chemical bonds with other stuff on Earth. Anything with those kinds of bonds you could burn for fuel and refine to oil. So the only question is, how much effort do you want to put in to find things that are really similar to the final product and go drill it or get it out of the ground (or the air or water). You \*could\* get more if you work hard at it, but the supply can vary.
Bitcoin's incoming market supply never varies. It's unearthly. It's not like any other commodity ever I think.

The price isn't set by how many people love or hate bitcoin, or that kind of thing.
The price is set, the spot price, is set by the most motivated buyers and sellers at any given moment.
But if you have bitcoin you just have it.
There is a lot of hot money in bitcoin, where people are ready to buy or sell at the drop of a hat; it's super liquid.
Stocks aren't really as liquid. A lot of people who own stock don't really have a lot of intentions of selling at any given moment.

The real issue is not so much the power consumption - but instead, what is going on is the power is inexpensive because the bureaucrats that make it available actually want to entice jobs (and taxes) so they subsidize the electricity:
"Plattsburgh’s Mayor Colin Read also detailed back in February that he would rather see high electricity consuming businesses pay real employees, rather than warehouses filled with just machines."
What I recommend is that we think of a way to have an entirely robotic, small, and packaged smelting system, something that takes maybe under 4 square meters, uses only robots (no people) and runs in place, producing ingots of things like aluminum, gold, lead, nickel, etc.  Then we can use their electricity for something else that also doesn't make jobs.

Bcash is a little less technology centric, they upped the blocksize so some old projects would be viable again at lower fees.

Nah, you open a channel with any other node on the network.
The coffee shop opens a channel with any other node too.
Now that both are in the Lightning network, they can leave it like that for as long as they want to risk the bitcoin that keeps the channel open.  Alice could keep her channel open for like a year, and the coffee shop could close and open their channel ... monthly. It doesn't matter.
What might get settled on the blockchain is is Alice closing hers with her first node, and the coffee chain totally separately closing theirs with their node. If those two had some connection to each other and things weren't settled, it works out so that neither side can cheat the other. You could hypothetically shoot yourself in the foot, but you can't steal from other people. You could accidentally give the other side some bitcoin, but you couldn't take it back.
That's how I think it's supposed to work.
Someone watching the blockchain is going to see a rare close channel from Alice to whatever node she's connected to (say a payment to settle up between Alice and Node "aadvark". Somewhere else on the blockchain, asynchronously, there will be a settle up payment between a Coffee shop and Node "zymurgyweekend")
Really hard for people outside LN (or even in LN!) to have any idea Alice paid that Coffee shop.

They're subsidizing the power, because they're deciding what is good or bad to spend it on. They want people to spend the power on either residential uses or industrial uses that create jobs/tax base. That's fine, but it means that they are subsidizing electricity in order to get those other things.

Well they're wrong. The only place where you can really make money mining bitcoin is in wild hinterlands disconnected from the larger world. In trapped places. These aren't "bad" places - Iceland, Sichuan, Pacific Northwest, but they are not connected by Ultra High Voltage lines to places like New York City, Beijing, or London. The grid just doesn't extend like that.
Now, given, that places with super cheap power had to build dams and other power plants to get that cheap power - why did they do it? Usually - to promote jobs and industry. They usually hope to lure smelters and the like to the area so they can have lots of nice middle class jobs. All fine and good. But the power stays cheap - why? Because these places are not well connected to the world in general. When you make something, you have to place a factory, get workers, and transport inputs and outputs. Hard to do in the middle of nowhere, no matter how cheap the power.
Power cost is just one cost in a profitable industry. Same for bitcoin mining but bitcoin mining just needs a really slow network connection (despite what you might have heard, DSL would probably be enough), cheap power, and some specialized mining hardware and a rack/room to put it into.
I am not against dismantling power plants built in the middle of nowhere, and which are so isolated from economic reality that their only customers are bitcoin miners. (As much as I love bitcoin).

Oh, well if you bought in person, then you would have had some original addresses... not sure if you tracked or remembered those?  If you did, then you could probably use the date of a site like Coinbase, and the price that date for what you paid. (Maybe there were no receipts and it was face to face). Or assume your basis is is really bad like $1, so you would pay the maximum tax (that might be safest).

[starts at 27:58 - with some editing to take out pause words for clarity] 
RON PAUL (RP):  I don't want to miss the opportunity to ask you a question about monetary policy which is something that fascinates me and I'm sure you recall there was a day when I asked Bernanke whether gold was money and that's been ruled out it's no longer money so that we have to work on something else and a lot of people are working on it and they were into the crypto currencies and I just wanted to get your opinion about this and where we stand because I quite frankly don't think the monetary system we have today is very healthy and that something will have to come about to change it and I just wanted to get your opinion on that
NASSIM TALEB (NT): [...] anytime you debase your currency you price yourself out of business and that's history - you know States used to issue their own currencies and you were not bound to use the currency per se of your state [you could] use the currency that you trusted; this is why for example in the story of the money changers in the New Testament that God only took the shekels of Tyre so people had to change into that currency; so it seems to me that bitcoin is a good start, it may not be the end, it may fail, but now we know how to do it because it is the first time in history we have now a currency that has absolutely no owner - that's distributed - so in other words you can't have someone controlling monetary policy it's a Hayekian like *a dream* to have something like that - now now bitcoin may fail, it's not yet a currency in the sense that it's transaction(s) are not easy to do but it's good because you could already see the effect of central banks worried about bitcoin. Let's say a bitcoin becomes endorsed by a State, any State, any random State, look what could happen next. International transaction in bitcoin, can you imagine? It is simply because nobody can mess with it, and you cannot ban transactions and we're getting deeper and deeper the [s--- store or value? gain? story? unintelligible]; Bitcoin itself may fail but the concept is ... the fact that bitcoin is at $8000 or whatever it is this morning it should be telling us something - I've heard the same people who say it should go to zero today are saying it should go to zero when it was at $50, right and of course at $1000 it should go to zero, at $1500 it should go to zero - now this is telling us something and it's already putting pressure on central banks. Just like similar, I live in a town near New York City where we had a very lousy taxi company and Uber opened and Uber became very common and now we have a good taxi company! The mere existence of that challenge to traditional banking by bitcoin is going to be good for everyone - maybe not for bitcoin but definitely a good start.

Yes also bitcoin is using stranded/trapped or subsidized energy - the cheapest energy it can find, in bulk.
Those sources are usually created in the middle of nowhere, and I think also built without the UVH lines that would get them to market - possibly deliberately. The idea is probably to make jobs like aluminum smelting in the middle of nowhere. The overcapacity of energy is all a boondoggle.
Or it's somewhere like Venezuela where they subsidize the energy usage, and then are surprised when people use it in ways they don't like.

Eh, well some people have a nose for the movements of markets. I think Richard Heart is doing okay for example. I remember when he posted he was selling his bitcoin, I think that was around $6k? So that seems prescient with hindsight.
But it's also possible to figure that the current value is not what it will someday be, and others like me might have assumed that the sheer size of the market and the ability to collar it with shorts and longs would tend to smooth out these big swings in price, but I was wrong.
So ... I think there's still some rational reasons to hold instead of trade, but to each their own.

It's obviously a matter of opinion to suggest that investing not-very-good money (inflatible US dollars) to something kind of arbitrary but having some very interesting properties as a money (bitcoin) isn't too bad a trade for spare dollars you don't care about.
Maybe you could buy 1/100th of a timeshare, or Lottery tickets, or splurge on a nice coffee every week, but $100 punt in bitcoin is hilariously good fun and very entertaining at least.

Your idea is not half bad. I like the idea of each of the parties doing their transactions with a fee small enough that they're not a priority but then since they do wind up coming in as a chain from one to the next, a last replace by fee transaction that does pay a good sized fee winds up balling up all those transactions into what the others are calling a cut through and wrap it up.

Unpopular view:
Terrorism is going to be paid for. Like take how Hamas pays families of suicide bombers who have attacked Israel.
From that, the corollary is that to "pay" for something means to give someone goods in exchange. You could literally give food, water, clothing, housing. But you could also give "money".
If you give "money" then it has to have the properties of money, like durability, fungibility, divisibility, and so on.
ISIS was trying to use gold dinars to pay for things. I can hate ISIS but see the logic in using a medieval money system like that in places where trust is low, electricity non-existent/intermittent, where buys and sells are face to face etc. Also, it needs not be said, that one person literally giving another person a golden coin and a handshake is pretty hard to stop. (Smart bombs try).  So they add into that a traditional system called Hawala I think, where people who know each other personally vouch for each end. That's pretty hard to intercept and stop. It's not a SWIFT or bank wire kind of thing.
So hypothetically, if some other money came along, and that money was bitcoin, Ethereum, dogecoin or whatever and it was fungible (effectively, untraceable, unable to distinguish a bad coin from a good coin), and divisible (no problem), easy to authenticate, etc.. then that money could be used, sorry naysayers.
Change my view, but I think that if we have so much problems with people paying for terrorism and terrorists getting paid, then you have to go kick in doors and jackboot around like thugs finding them, it's not the money's fault.

But a soft fork only requires you passively accept it.

But it would be just a soft fork if you wanted everyone to start choosing "1beer" as the start of a vanity address for all destination coins. I have no idea who would follow you that direction, but you could choose as a node to only relay transactions that look right to you.

The Genesis Block is the first block. It's very special. Technically it has no parent and I don't think it's bitcoins are spendable, but I forget why.  The address the coins were sent to though is an otherwise normal bitcoin public address.
Normally when coins are mined, I don't think they're spendable until the next 100 blocks. That way if a miner mines some bitcoin (the current reward is 12.5 bitcoin I think) - then they have to wait a long while (get BURIED under proof of work) until they can spend. Most users can spend willy nilly though because those are confirmed whenever, either a long time ago or recently.

The sponsor's goal was to find out what millionaires liked to do, and then market to that demographic. Maybe millionaires like to: play polo, golf, climb mountains, sail yachts, skydive, play with sportscars?
Well, the millionaire next door showed that your average millionaire lives a low-key lifestyle and was a plumber or dentist or the like, and spent very little. And they really didn't buy a lot of luxuries or luxury watches, and a lot of them still had a cheap car. Etc.

Hard forks are anything you do that loosens the rules. You do a hard fork to add features or to allow something that you think you would add value.
Soft forks are things you can opt into and if enough people do, then they tighten the rules. They help you protect the system by further defining the rules of the game.

Regulation of what? No I don't think anarchists want regulation. Even libertarians aren't keen on regulation.
EDIT: I would think that anarchists like regulation if it helps normies understand that the State is an overgrown, way too powerful, entity. So if regulation gets them allies, they are for it. But they're not in favor of State control. I don't think they mind the State taking off the mask and getting the belt out and using it on other people, as an example of what State power does, except of course that they feel bad for people getting the strap. But, as anarchists, they have been adversaries to State power so they are not keen on it, but they probably don't mind the State spending energy on people that don't care - and making them care.

Not sure if this helps, a Satoshi quote:
" The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production  cost.  If the price is below cost, then production slows down.  If the  price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more.   At the same time, the increased production would increase the  difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.        "
The market of people that buy, sell and hold bitcoin is what really sets the market price. From that price, miners look at their inputs (electricity, CPUs) and figure out what they want to take on in mining it. They're basically turning a resource they get cheaply (electricity mostly) into something they don't have good access to (raw capital, like dollars/yen/euros). It's a way for miners in China, Iceland, Washington state, Venezuela, etc, to take their cheap electricity and arbitrage it to the world. What we get in exchange is a really secure decentralized network. Also, some of the miners are in pools of smaller miners, and those smaller miners are money enthusiasts who like bitcoin.
Why do we like this network? Because you can't use politics  (very easily) to move coins around, make more for your friends, change other people's balances and things like that. 
Yes obviously hackers can go after exchanges, and Node.js wallets and all kinds of nonsense around the edges, but that's like crime everywhere. 
Mainly bitcoin is this big secure trustworthy ledger more or less outside State control (governments around the world). We don't have to give a flip about how the Central Bank of China or how the Federal Reserve feels about how many bitcoins are made or who they go to when they're mined.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:31:31

Oh you can just make them up.
The idea is that the bitcoin character set in the old original address format, starts with a 1, then has a bunch of characters, and then at the end a checksum.
These addresses do have private keys, like 2^48 of them I forget the math, but the key idea is that the search space is so big, handwaving something like 2^220th (I forget exactly) that it's still basically not findable, no worse than any other bitcoin address anyway. I don't want to repeat trash math, but it's something like that.
Bitcoins sent to a burn address are gone forever.

Sorry you got downvoted ...
Yes and no - I think that no one ever made the distinction before - but one kind of fiat currency is government issued currency where the sovereign proclaims a value for it, force you to accept it to settle debts, and make you pay taxes in it, but the currency itself has no 'intrinsic value' - like gold or silver. 
Another idea of fiat is anything that is made up. Yes bitcoin is made up and only has value to those inside the system of values that bitcoin reflects.

Think of it as a global hard drive that I can write messages to for a fee. I can send these messages basically without censorship. But they're not very big messages.
Notionally, the messages are paid for by small fees, and space is limited, but having more bitcoin means you could send more messages, make digital contracts etc. 
So I think it has value. 
If you really think it has no value, then you probably don't own any.
If why bitcoin rather than any of another thousand cryptos, since a lot of people think all cryptos are equal, I would say to that - go for it. Try to build a community of people that treat your crypto as having some value. Example, dogecoin or garlicoin, they are out there randomly creating new cryptos.

My story is that I had a friend who married really well, older guy, but his wife was from a wealthy family. I used to talk about investing with him and he told me it was really rude. I thought that was odd at the time. Later on, I thought about the damage you could cause to people who don't know how to make their own choices in life. I had invested in some biotech, a coworker mentioned it and I invested in an index of it. But looking back, I could see how someone with low maturity and a lot of desperation might think other people can tell them or should tell them how to invest. Plus the way the Chinese govt constantly was harping anti-bitcoin in a paternalistic way telling people that bitcoin was not a proper investment etc. (Yes obviously, it's a speculation, and it's not an income producing farm, or stock in a company)  But just overall the paternalism of the approach - telling grown adults what they should or shouldn't be invested in, that's where I think in total I have learned my lesson both ways. I would surely explain bitcoin to anyone that's curious, and I'd just tell them that the time to buy is not when it's in a skyrocketing mania, and the time to sell is not when it's near new lows. But again, situations vary, only toss in what you wouldn't mind losing, yadda yadda.

The same logic carried forward means that things can crash and recover so many times that it will defy logic.
It crashes to wipe out all the people who aren't in it for idelogical or use purpose. Then the ones that are into it for the ideology or the use cases keep steadily buying, high or low, and it recovers, soars, and crashes again.
As bitcoin reaches new highs, it finds new use cases. You couldn't use it to buy and sell houses when they were worth pennies and there were no liquid markets.

You mean, name a book where everyone in it transacts anonymously and it's not a dystopia? Well, I think you're setting a high bar maybe. The Modern era is a surveillance state of being and living, as predicted by Orwell.
But anywhere and everywhere pre-1900 when people used gold, silver, and gold and silver certificates was that kind of era where people were much more anonymous in where or how they had money. They could keep it in banks, or in safes at home, or bury it, etc. And just like now, authorities could seize their money etc. 
But unlike now, people I think had more financial privacy.

Stock market prices will be fixed so that they go upwards and preserve value, I wouldn't worry about it. BUT - money printing will happen, benefits like Social Security and Cost of Living will be contained, and prices of things people really really need (housing, education, health care etc) will generally explode upwards.
For sure there's downwards pressure on stock market prices because the Baby Boomers are all retiring, the average one retires this year.
But I expect that the Fed like the Bank of Japan did a decade ago, that the Fed will buy assets and prop up this whole shitshow. If they don't - that's okay, the prices will drop, but eventually recover since the only place to hold value in most people's minds would be in gold or stocks (like Zimbabwae). Also, you could use bitcoin.
The big problem with stocks is people dreaming they are going to make 7% to 10% on stocks, instead of realizing you could make -20% to +20% with a lot of volatility and NO guarantees.

\&gt;  Energy networks are  set up based on use.
Not really, some places have things like hydro plants that have destroyed rivers and fish habitat, and don't really support the locals very well, and lack the UHV lines to transport the power. So those stranded sources - are deliberately built that way - so that Alcoa will show up and give everyone jobs smelting aluminum. That's the desperate hope of some communities with extra power. That's why it's totally okay for an industrial smelter to show up (jobs!), but not okay for bitcoin miners (no jobs). These groups play favorites. They're not about the environment. If they gave a shit about the environment, they would remove the dam, and stop being the cheap source of power with about a 10 km range.

Disprove what?
All bitcoin can ever do is just be bitcoin. It's them that see the world through a certain set of lenses.
It's a fact that bitcoin uses as much power as they say.
But they don't wonder why people would pay so much for bitcoin (or other cryptos) and produce that instead of making aluminum foil (or like this article suggests, instead of smelting metal).
They don't question why bitcoin as a "product" or system exists.
They think something like bitcoin is for Libertarians or druggies or foreigners, and they don't realize that everyone has a need for sound money. Just that some groups need it much more (either ideologically, or practically). Also, some criminal scams require a money that can't be seized by anyone (so that drives a negative outlook on it).
They don't question whether or not the electrical power would go to waste anyway ...
They don't wonder why power plants are being built to create cheap wasted power and what political forces exist to fund and approved these sources of trapped stranded power (which is why the electricity is cheap).
So they are extremely lost.

The police go after things that are at the scale to keep them employed.
So they don't go after small stuff (jaywalking), and they don't go after HUGE stuff (things that are touchy and political, like walk in and arrest Hillary Clinton or Trump)
They go after things that are right-sized.
So rather than go chase down muggers or graffiti artists, you can get some cool points right now doing electronic tracing of hackers that are using the bitcorns on the Interwebs.
I'll go write an interface to ping them in Visual Basic, and sell it to the police for monie$$$.

Well, we all know that it's going to be mined based on cheap stranded power.
That the builders of this overcapacity are going to be in places like China where the State can take on mindbogglingly unprofitable mega projects. Or it will be in communities that have the excess power but no really feasible way to get it to market.
Or, the local communities where bitcoin mining off their cheap power - where it gets banned - it will be because the communities are scheming to keep the power cheap in order to lure jobs like smelting aluminum. And wise companies will stay away because of the strings attached. They're just looking to parasite and milk off some company, like that place in upstate New York that banned bitcoin mining off their cheap power. They want the jobs and tax incentives, eg they want to trap and milk companies, not actually make anything. Making something productive is a side effect that they don't really care about. If they love the environment so much, they can remove their dams.
It's not a foregone conclusion that bitcoin mining will always be so environmentally friendly, or help salvage the sunk costs of malinvestment in stranded hydro. See - apparently in places like Texas they just flare off the waste natural gas from oil wells. But that could be used to power crypto miners. So not sure if that counts or not.
And last, we wouldn't need to be into bitcoin or cryptocurrency if we all had financial privacy and could trade with whoever we want and buy what we like.

This is just something I totally love.
One of my main reasons for being in bitcoin is partly for the cool crypto, but mostly to see the development of secure hardware and software - with bitcoin, what's at risk is our secret keys or master seeds, and the process of validating addresses and digitally signing and transmitting them - and it gets into all kinds of interesting issues related to security - in a small interesting problem. If you can solve security issues related to bitcoin, you can solve other things too.

Yep, bitcoin has been good for me. I no longer advise people on anything specific. Only they know their own life and money is such a big deal that you can't really and shouldn't try to meddle or interfere with other people's priorities. They just have to live it out on their own.

Every post here needs to be directly and purely about bitcoin.
We are not interested in how bitcoin is actually used or valued. Never.
Only bitcoin, pure and total.
Only how the cryptography works, the math works, the whitepaper, how nodes work. 
Be your own bank. But do not ever spend it or use it.

Sure, one problem with the patent system is that it can be maddening to realize what they think is obvious or not.
I almost think that the patent system should have some domain experts they can call on to ask the question: 
"How would you solve the problem of a phone slipping out of your hand and falling to the ground, what would you do to stop it from getting hurt?"
And if someone says a protector case, and someone else says a gyro to flip it to a bumper edge, and someone else says a gryo to flip it so it lands flat on it's back, and someone else says a freefall detector with pop-out springs ....
Then the patent says "little rockets on the edges" ... okay pass that back as the suggestion, mixed in with the others.
Then back to the reviewers: besides your own way to do it, which of these were obvious? Which are patent worthy?
They laugh, wow little rockets? And it turns out yep that was a proposal (by our patent seeker) - and then it turns out that no, they have no working prototype, they just wanted the patent because they thought it up.
Maybe another good example would be how Feynman got the patent on using a nuclear power plant in an airplane. He got the patent for that because the govt asked what are all the applications of this, potentially? And it's just absurd to think of all the different ways you could use a nuclear power plant.
Anyway, I hate the patent office and I wish it didnt exist.
People just reverse engineer and have to work around the stupid patents anyway. They're a nuisance and they get in the way.

The ordinary politics that bitcoin is just hard to change.
Hard forks are used to add features. 
Getting consensus around a new extra feature is hard.
Soft forks, where you restrict features or take things out or stop allowing something, are easier to achieve.
But it's still a social / political thing, and bitcoiners (like me) are not keen on change for no good or great reason.

You know, it does sound like routing through the network is hard;
I know this sounds simplistic, but could we just ask people to have in the name an (x,y) location for routing? Just if where you want to go is northeast of you, go northeast?
And encourage people to make 4+ connections in different directions. 
And if you have a bigger channel, encourage people to make "long" jumps.
Now I'm starting to think that you should have North/South/East/West channels, and "distance" be the amount of bitcoin in the channel. So the other end will "stick" or make a channel with someone, if they're reliable, and if they're approximately large channels too, and if they are in approximately the right place. You could do a little math. The ideal downstream partner is about 1/4 your size and far away in the right direction.

I thought the chip was quite real, it's just that's it the Integrated Lights Out (ILO) or DRAC (Dell Remote somethignsomething) and it lets you do things like turn a motherboard on or off etc. It lives at a motherboard level, probably sits on some low speed bus (is that the Northbridge?) and can ssee whatever goes by, and maybe it has DMA (direct memory access) to some places on the computer, and it surely can flash the ram, and I think it can give you an RDP-like console session, which maybe it can choose to hide and/or not log.
It didn't seem that far-fetched. But also, government / Nation-state level actors can do whatever the f they feel like in the common commodity computers used by normal people. Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iPhone and all kinds of firewalls and routers are already compromisable at the point and click of a few tools to these levels of state sponsored hackers.

I liked the example on using a 21 computer to share disk space, like a whole box for 24 hours.
Is there some way this could be organized and/or guaranteed to people and built a little better? 
I like to follow what MaidSafe, Storj and Sia (siacoin) are up to, and I'm curious if you have a way that we can easily rent out terabytes or petabytes of disk space for a few bitcoin --- 
But there'd have to be somewhere (akin to a bitcoin mining pool?) where people could go and look up something standard like a way to get and use disk space - maybe something either bittorrent friendly or user friendly like mapped drives (akin to Dropbox or spideroak) - and then a way to pay for it...
I can see how your 21 box could be similar to Grid/gridcoin and be paid for with bitcoin....
Do we just do it and then hope that organization of all this comes later?

Kind of -- 
I think of bitcoin a bit differently .. see if you agree maybe
Pretend you were in a position to use electricity, and you could make aluminum foil, or bitcoin. You could do one of those things (pretend it's an A or B kind of choice).
Now, you don't really care, you just want to sell whatever people are paying more for.
For some reason Mr Market values bitcoin as being worth more, so you make that.
bitcoin is not backed by the electricity usage, but it turns out that to mine any profitably, you have to use specialized computers now (ASICs) and use a lot of electricity.
The backing is more social, in that I see you have some bitcoin, and at current prices (around $10.5k market price) -- I will buy any you have off you at $8k. 
I know when I'm getting bitcoin because you can't fake it. This value, and why I value it at that (or why anyone does) are just properties of a good money - one of the properties is that you can't forge it.
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:36:02

Coinbase until you get a Trezor to send it to.
When you do, practice with small tests, don't push it all at once.
EDIT: and when it's time to buy a Trezor, and when it's time to use a Trezor, ask again then. 
Watch out if the Trezor comes with the seed words preset, that would be a scammer trying to trick you into using a secret that they know to steal your coins. So, when the time comes, ask how to buy it securely, how to set it up, and how to send to it etc. All will be explained then.

We're all kind of jaded here. It doesn't really move the needle, these weird announcements. 
Anyone who really wanted to buy $10 bil in bitcoin would keep it a secret and buy (and sell) to paint the tape, and then buy openly with like their last $10 to $100 million. So 95% of the buys would attempt to at least have no effect on the market (buy and sell to paint the tape, trying to keep the market flat - eventually the market would notice the lack of supply for sale, but you trick the charts for as long as you can, then spark the rally with the last 5% of your funds).
So summary, the last thing someone with $10 bil to buy bitcoin would do is fucking tell anyone.

This is why I feel that having to pay taxes on "gift bitcoins" from these forks is bullshit. (A different thread from someone who claimed a CPA) 
I didn't ask for these coins, I don't want to have to "collect" them, install fucking malware  etc. At least half my bitcoin are in cold storage, air gapped, offline, etc, and I am not risking them to this crud.

Stay skeptical, but yes the other coins are bad. Bitcoin is not a coin that is designed to gank you for your money the way the others are pump and dumps, or created just to make the creators rich. Therefore, the other ones will have more hot money thrown at them (they have marketing teams). If you want to chase hot money, you could get rich trying, but bitcoin is here to stay and the most solid. Ethereum is a close runner up, and Litecoin, and Monero, etc.

Then get rid of the hydro plants.
You could use bitcoin mining to discover crappy malinvestment in energy production world wide.
By definition, they have a swamp of cheap power and no customers (but miners), so by definition it's trash, remove it.
With bitcoin we win either environmentally, or financially, we just have to turn this on it's head.
If power is so cheap but isolated that only bitcoiners can make use of it, then remove the power plant.
If financial networks are so open to participation, but private and not censorable, then we have financial freedom. Also, if no one can control the money supply and it "just is", super.

You're paying bitcoin so that someone would read your email to them.
It's to stop spammers.
See, if I send an email with 0.001 bitcoin in it (about $38 USD) to someone, hey its kind of worth their time to open it and collect it. I could probably use some kind of time locked contract so that they have to open it in a week. 
They could probably just have a computer open it and never even read the message. Are spammers just going to send free bitcoin hoping someone reads??
But if a spammer has to send 0.00001 bitcoin (38 cents) to get someone to read their mail they can't mass send spam. They can't afford it.
It probably wouldn't end spam, it would intensify it. It would make it so that a spammer would pick just one or two victims and try a really long drawn out phish or compromise over email. It would slow them down, I'm not sure it would help honestly, but that's the idea.
It would waste people's time less.
But upside, email would become a faucet.

He got a sweet deal to get BASIC into IBM PCs. Then grew it from there. His cleverness was to charge people for something that other programmers were giving copies to each other for free, like operating systems, a BASIC interpreter etc.
Bill Gates is Not Dumb. He's smart, just like Richard Stallman is smart. But even if you thought they were both equally smart, Bill Gates had a way to monetize what he had, and other smart people valued other things.

Replying to myself instead of editting the comment, here's an article comparing prices for moving a TB a month.
I don't know if $100 is too much, that seems like the high end. So the pricing for network is right now ~1/4th of a bitcoin a year. Just for the bandwidth. Price in the other things and maybe a datacenter connection could cost you almost a bitcoin a year. They don't price it in bitcoin, but I just feel like using that as the unit of account to put things into perspective.

It's like reading operating room journals by a veterinarian who's trying to be a surgeon on humans. There's enough there that you know they've got some experience in the general problems at least. There wouldn't be that many people that could fiction up a story like that...
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:18:15
Ah okay, you meant a normal meaning. I am for that, carry on.
You mean the post above yours, you think that he's wrong and that you can assess the future value of possibly anything?
I think that too far out in the time frames, it might be impossible. Like if you said: in 4000 years, solar energy will have no value. I would be like hmm, no idea. If you had another time frame like, tommorrow solar power will have no value, I would be skeptical of that claim! So I think the word winds up being a bit meaningless without the context ... yeah that guy had a lot of things left undefined ... 
I just get tired of the semantics

Yes I agree, I am skeptical that it helps. It's hard to tell if things like Fibonacci retracements are "real" "emergent" properties of the system, and something you can actually act on, or if they are just retrospective back-fitting to an event to explain something like an excuse after its already happened.

Right, the normal amount of bitcoin.
But to give you an idea of how unlikely he is to get paid out by mining at such a low hashrate ...
Find a site that lets you do SHA256 with a computer. Now look for leading 0's - logically you have to do it about 8 times (1/2 of 16, because hexidecimal) to get a leading 0.
Now try to get 3 or 4 leading zeros. You'll be trying random numbers (nonces = number used once) for quite a while before you find one that gets you a few leading zeroes.
I dont remember how far in the difficulty is for bitcoin but I would not be too surprised if it was nearly 30 or past that.
I think it's almost 1 in a trillion at this point that a given random number hashes out to enough difficulty to win the bitcoin coinbase payout.

It could, if it wants to fall again it will have to explore $5k, then $3k, then $2k, etc. It will explore and explore the downwards edge for a while, now's a good time to buy if you want to buy, and a good time to delay selling.

Not going to be a popular idea, Nassim Taleb's suggestion: nationalize the banks, and let hedge funds go do their thing without public money.
 Letting big national banks go play with our money sets us up for a situation where if they profit they keep the money or give to themselves and shareholders, and if they blow up they make the public pay by having the government rescue them and in the long run we pay the deficit with our taxes.
This is just another case of "heads we win, tails you lose", too big to fail, private profits and public losses.

Eh, I remember Vitalik was accused back in early days of some kind of scammy quantum mechanical mining scheme that was plaigiarized from someone else, also met with Putin, and crowdfunded Ethereum with some Proof of Burn and made Ethereum which is fine I guess, but then rolled back the chain with the DAO hack, and then got swamped by cryptokitties.

It always crashes, it constantly crashes. bitcoin: you *know* it's gonna crash.
People keep thinking (not saying you do) but the way normal people interpret bitcoin crashes, is that they think it's the end, the death of bitcoin. But it's actually just cheap coins at that moment in time. Then forward, up, crash again, rinse and repeat. This process slowly shakes out the fearful, the greedy, etc. When the crashes happen, the scams get revealed, unfortunately the really gullible will lose out, etc.

If you give someone or a wallet a copy of your private keys, they can generate a public key from that, trivially.
So if a computer can search your files looking for private keys, and you let it, then it can get a copy and steal your bitcoin.
If however you start with the public keys out on the blockchain and try to work backwards by generating possible private keys and seeing which public keys you get - you will be doing that until the end of time -
Unless someones key generator is broken, and you catch that,
Or they made a dumb passphrase (called a brain wallet) and used that as a key (like "mary had a little lamb") - if they use easy to guess, non-random keys, or pseudorandom keys with inadequate entropy, or a Trojan Horse key generator, or put a copy of their key somewhere where someone finds it, then game over.
Uh, welcome to bitcoin :)

Yeah gmail does a good job stopping spam etc. 
I would have bet that the original vision was more for people that like ran their own email server to read and send their own email (heh)
Whereas something like gmail can see everyone's inboxes and use that to fight spam. (Also, crush your privacy or market your info). So depends on what you want...
Also, I am not sure -- can veropost be used to sign up for something like wix.com?   Can I receive emails that are automated from some key domains, just not weirdo spammer domains? Like maybe I want email from amazon.com etc. But not from odd stuff where I have no clear relationship.
Or is this envisioned as more like a personal email account thing. People to people only really. (That's still valuable)

This sort of adoption by celebrities is all very interesting as deplatforming becomes the new thing.
Yeah but it's this interesting trade off between "eventual moon" or hyperbitcoinization at the most extreme end ... or .....
* no Fed bailots, no QE, no bailins of bank customers better money management by the Fed
* less of this deplatforming stuff (more free speech)
* less or money seizure / civil asset forfeiture
* banking secrecy / private numbered bank accounts
Since I think the illiberal system we have will keep on with irresponsible QE, deplatforming pressure on payment processors and banks, keep on seizing people's assets unfairly, and not allow financial privacy / banking secrecy (taxes on income instead of something easier and fairer like proper taxes on Real Estate only - Georgism), well ....
Eventually bitcoin will win. Probably because it was first and had an immaculate conception.

Yes if the key is as long as the data. The key could look like noise.
Example - you have some dlls in c:\windows\system32
I start with a forbidden PDF of secret info.
I figure out what data I need to XOR with a file in windows\system32 ..  I get out a file that looks like odd data.
 I could encrypt it too with a password. Now it looks like noise.
I could encode it to a blockchain.

Yeah I just re-read my post and now I think that maybe even if we gave crypto miners dedicated mining cards, they would try to move to something else that commodity users have, like CPUs, or semi-dedicated CPUs in some way....
Like CPUs with tons of cores, or just algos that take lots and lots and lots of RAM.
Something that again, would be something they can buy at Fry's Electronics or Best Buy, but that they could also corner the market on component availability - almost like it helps make the mining a little more exclusive.
Kind of like how China loves ASICs - they make them, its easy to get them, they would not be keen on having cheap easy to find computers be good at mining.
I don't know... hmm mining is strange sometimes. I have to meditate on this.

@_date: 2018-02-07 17:44:26




Hahaha, oh my fucking god.
EDIT: My first impression of all those fancy papers is that they are just bias confirmation by orthodox economists parroting to each other their disdain and skepticism. YOU seem to be fine.  I think, personally, that trading is full of dangerous risks that are beyond the mere price and therefore not worth doing. BUT if you're using their papers to make money, I think that's awesome and hilarious. To me, I think most of these papers are orthodox economists justifying the stupidity of not having bought bitcoin around $100-$400. Before that point, I think it was too risky and too dodgy. Just as Mt Gox died, the right place to buy was Bitstamp, and that was the time.  But everyone has their own risk appetite. Kind of like driving: anyone that drives faster than me is taking on a bit of risk right, and anyone that drives slower than me is an idiot. But with bitcoin: anyone that buys bitcoin at higher prices than me is pushing the envelope, and anyone that wouldn't buy bitcoin at the price I did really missed out. I symbolically purchased a little bit at 10k ;) so I think any price under that, right now, is a decent price, if you're buying. 
Next my bias against economists: unlike law and medicine which seemed to really come to their beginnings in a big way in the medieval era, which is why they have a lot of Latin terms - economics got its "start" to my belief with Adam Smith. And he wrote in plain English. (Also, fucking Marx - who wrote in German - who was just a philosopher but fancied himself as some kind of Communist economist... bleh). But I think that turns out to hurt their cause. There was another thread where some poor guy wanted to talk about a "price floor" for bitcoin - and got all kinds of confusing vitriol back. What MOST people - and definitely bitcoiners - don't know is that to economists, ordinary English words like "market, price, cost, value, capital, labor, production" etc, is all very very very carefully and precisely defined to a degree that ordinary language is not. Economists mean something super duper precise. Unlike a science like Chemistry which looked for elements and found atoms and molecules, and where people understand that the world is made of these components and look to chemists to understand and explain that, with economics, people get fooled by the ordinary terms in use and think they "know" something (and they do) -- but ordinary people and economists talk past each other.

This is like markets 101. Basically the current price is set by the most motivated buyers and sellers. Doesn't everyone know this??
If anything, bitcoin has *too many* active participants, which is what this means. It has people ready to sell or buy at the drop of a hat, and it makes it volatile.
But that's not really a big deal, and if you're into making money, volatility is where it's at. Just go long and short and collar it.

I would say that historically the price has an upward bias. Going forward, hard to say. At any given moment, the best predictor of future price is the current price. The game though has a wide range. I think that by the end of the year it could be half to double the current price, so I would bet bitcoin $12k

Eh well, I'm going to suggest something really different. I would wish for a tax on only real estate - Georgism
It's very fair, there's no tax evasion and there's no escaping it wherever there are goons with guns anyway.
You get your financial privacy back because you could work it out so that you don't even need to know the owner if you're the govt. Just was the tax paid or not.
To make the amount of tax easy to judge, just allow people to pay the tax of nominally something like 4%. Allow them to pay nominally 8% (double what the owner paid last year) and that would allow you to eminent domain a sale (at 100% value) over to the previous owner if they don't counter it by raising their taxes in response.
You can make exceptions for homes.
Anyway, with that you would have a very fair tax system.

Meh, the "bullish case" where they think altcoins matter is trash. Any altcoins past the top 40 or so don't really matter. New altcoins come and go, and most are not sticking around. They dilute only in an illusory way bitcoin's dominance. Example - Ripple, pure garbage, unnecessary etc. 60% premine by the company, not needed on their special Ripple network, just a weird pre-ICO token. Ethereum, running probably near 2nd or 3rd place (haven't looked in a while), is a cool world computer, but hamstrung by actual apps like cryptokitties. Caught in a world where if it has any utility, it gets hamstrung by it's notional USD value and becomes too expensive to run programs. Then gets cloned, etc. Bitcoin tries to balance this and since it wants to be a store of value first, bitcoin will tend to make network choices that encourage store of value uses over being a world computer. So I expect bitcoin to gain ground vs Ethereum over time actually. The really sneaky projects are the ones with big premines like Zcash (20% to dev funds with each new block). In the long run, almost all the alts are going to be trash.
Next the bear case. Falls to zero. Well let's just say that the real win is that if banks let us send uncensored anonymous money, and finds a way to make absolutely predictable and limited supply, then bitcoin disappears. If they don't, by blocking payments (sanctions, pressure on merchants etc), or if they print money, then bitcoin wins.
So ..... given their stupid predilection to print money, bitcoin wins.

Yes ....... well that's what happens to any pile of fiat. 
Banks HATE wiring money out of their system. "Compliance" steps in to stop it. Political pressure to kill cryptocurrency markets come around. People that society doesn't like (for all kinds of reasons, some you might agree with, others you might not) - they have their ability to get payments stopped and thwarted (again, situationally you may agree or disagree with any given case or example) -
So again, there is always some excuse to seize or try to thwart the movement in and out of fiat to crypto.
Tether is a token that allows exchanges to trade a permissioned token system around, and avoid the inter-bank wires, and probably helps confuse the systems and software that want to follow the money and/or intercept and thwart bank wires. Tether sounds somewhat transparent and opaque at the same time. Apparently people can track the total amount issued. Maybe they can track how much a given exchange has.

The problem is, you can make as many proof of stake coins as you want, and have stakes in all of them. It's not actually limited.
But if you make a proof of work coin, and it comes down to spending electricity to mine it, then you have to pick a coin to mine and burn energy on. Once you've spent that energy, you have given up an opportunity cost to secure or mine the other coin. So you're forced to actually pick one. So there should only ever be one strongest proof of work coin, but there can be unlimited proof of stake coins and of course unlimited tokens.
We can clone Ethereum all day, and use marketing to push this version or that, just like different programming languages.
But if you have a proof of work coin, it forces you to pick sides. There could be maybe multiple coins, if each has their own POW algorithm and forces you to have very specific hardware

True, but whichever side is less patient and wants market price is the side that gets whatever market price is inflicted on them.

The use of actual power (proof of work) is the only thing that keeps you from mining millions of different coins etc (proof of stake and other systems)
Admittedly, it's a "who shouts the loudest" kind of lottery system, where the volume of hashing is correlated with both the advanced efficiency of newer and newer models of mining equipment combined with raw electrical consumption.

You don't need a mortgage though. Houses are depreciating assets and they have no income stream. It's weird that people invest in them at all.
So how houses would be made - one way is you start with land and live on something small, and the build the house out and enlarge it around it. You make a low quality and inexpensive extension if you really need more rooms quickly, or you add a higher quality expansion if you have money and just want more room.
If you're buying an older place, you're fine.
If you're worried about businesses, they just have to be more productive as a use of capital, eg have better ROI, than just holding bitcoin. Which is a tough bet! But some businesses will be good ideas and get funding.
No worries. A lot of the malinvestment around us will go away. Less highways to nowhere etc.

I've read the book.
Black swans literally warn you to not always assume that the absence of something makes the current situation the way it is and will always be. There could be something new that blows the whole thing up. 
Maybe the lesson I got out of it was, get paid to take on risks, and if you see people rushing in foolishly making wild assumptions using models with just a few variables in the real actual world with millions of variables, just expect their shit to explode. Take the opposite side of that trade, and wait for the black swan to wreck their shit and pay you $$$.
For me, that means having more value in assets like stocks - which should keep up in price if the Fed runs the presses and inflation goes haywire ... then also having fiat debt in a mortgage at a fixed rate ... if they inflate the money, my fixed debts get easier to pay, also bitcoin - because here is something new and risky and worth the risk, 
Some risks I am not covering very well:
What if society totally breaks down, or food distribution just totally stops, or the power supply fails, WW3 etc? 
I am not as prepared for some risks, and I don't want to get too crazy about it. Some things I just can't affect very much and I am fucked if it ever happens.

No, I know this is mindbogglingly bad, but what is going on is the hydro plants are built so far from customers that they cant store or transmit the power anywhere very far. They have to build the ultra high voltage (UHV) power lines and they don't. Making a big wonderful grid would be good. They make the power, or don't but no one can use it.
I am also not against them just shutting down and dismantling hydro plants that no one needs.
In the Pacific NW the hydro plants ruin the salmon runs, but are renewables. So it's more of a toss up in the PNW. They're kind of good/kind of bad. The PNW has a lot of small dams, maybe hundreds.

On some exchanges, what they record isn't the high and low price like they should (and open and close), but the open and close price.
So as long as you dump, and then buy a little, the ticker looks the same. It seemed like Bitstamp did it that way. But they could have changed it. I could swear that you could move fast enough to cover your tracks. That'd be painting the tape. 
It's any kind of effort like that to tell a false story to others. They might think the volume isn't dumping, but buying. It's hard to tell from just volume what's going on.

Article says it was a Ponzi (the usual unrealistic returns):
Austrian Scam Optioment Causes Victims Lose Over 12,000 BTC ($115 Million)
23 hours Report
An alleged scam involving investments in bitcoin in Austria has reportedly affected over ten thousand investors in the country and around Europe.
Details are emerging about an Austrian investment scheme, dubbed “Optioment”, where its operators have reportedly stolen some 12,000 bitcoins (approx. $116 million in current prices) from over 10,000 victims invested in the scheme. The scheme ran a website, now offline, claiming to be a ‘premier global Bitcoin investment product’ stemming from a ‘private Costa Rica-based bitcoin fund’. The scheme also claimed to have its ‘investment’ platform backed by assets over 35,000 BTC.
A Die Presse report reveals investors were lured by the promise of soaring returns of 1.5%-4% per week on their deposited bitcoins. Investors were also rewarded for bringing new users into the fold.
“OPTIOMENT pays you Bitcoins when you share it with your friends and business colleagues,” an excerpt from the now-defunct website, available on the Internet Archive. ‘Our unlevel compensation plan’s first level pays you 7%, second level 4%, third level 3% and way more. And it pays you everytime a member in your downline makes a deposit, not only for the first time but for every time. Active and Passive!’
The largest investor event organized by Optioment occurred in the weeks before its collapse, where 700 participants turned up at a hotel in Vienna. The investment scheme also saw its network expand to investors in Poland, Romania and former Yugoslavia.
While payouts were made for several months, the multi-level marketing scheme ultimately collapsed in November 2017. Toward the end of January, Austria’s Financial Markets Authority began collaborating with the prosecutors’ office in Vienna to carry out an investigation on the suspicion of fraud and/or pyramid play, the Die Presse report added.

Oh a Shadow PC is a cloud-based gaming PC. It sounds like Shadow has some graphics cards out in the cloud and then it sends you gameplay to your more ordinary PC. Interesting.
Probably Shadow PCs will run specific game titles and probably not run cryptocurrency mining software. 
Bitcoin has been through an evolution though in mining - from CPUs, to GPUs, to FPGAs, to ASICs. In early days you could mine bitcoins on the CPU of your PC. Later, you had to use the GPU of your graphics card. Then people programmed FPGAs for faster efficiency in hashing, and last, they literally created specialized chips called ASICs for the fastest possible speeds. At this point the ASICs are trying to hash faster at lower power usage. Since electricity use is a limiting factor you want the best cost for hashes for watts. 
If you had a GPU farm, then you could mine GPU-friendly coins. But bitcoin has moved on to ASIC technology and it's hard for commodity hardware to be competitive with their efficiency.
Hope you enjoy reading more -- what a lot of people do is they mine other cryptocurrencies on their graphics cards and then sell out for bitcoin. They join a pool, and the pool mines anything that makes them the most money, switching which cryptocurrency to mine according to market prices. They do it in a pool because only the combined power of many miners will payout reasonably often enough to be rewarded, and they split the reward with you and the other miners.

I think the people that think they *shouldn't* be audited make an argument like:

* this is just harassment of the Fed, which is busy and runs a system we all need running efficiently
* the Fed's book are deliberately opaque in order to prevent market speculation on what assets they will buy
* it's just Treasury bills
* it's a basic misunderstanding of economic math: there is no balance of accounts at the Fed. They literally have an unlimited checkbook to buy anything - anything they want to buy, to support the economy, they can
The counter arguments:
* what if they're buying assets that they own, selling at a high price some garbage, to themselves, and dumping it later, then rebuying etc, turning the Fed into a personal money printing machine?
* what if, if you analyzed what they were buying, what if you could find a clear pattern of them helping their friends?
* what if, you could show that they are deliberately letting businesses go bust that they could have helped
* what if there is no smart Wizard of Oz behind this thing, but it's all a big charade and there's no infallible wizard in charge, just some assholes?

I thought this comment was interesting: "Disappointing yes, but also very Illuminating. It demonstrates that Roger thinks that plain text stored seeds are secure. I find this highly ironic considering that these systems are primarily about cryptographic protection. Would would his software not use AES or any other cipher to secure the value?"
I have made some advances in my own thoughts about security. And nowadays, I think I would say: What are your user's expectations? And what are your security guarantees? Bitcoin wallets that run on commodity Windows or Linux PCs, or Android or iPhone mobile wallets, or websites - you have to understand what the user's expectations are and you have to know the capabilities and limitations of the offering, and you have to spell all that out super clearly for people. 
I think it's getting to a point where someone might want to lay out - if you were trying to work with bitcoin at a higher order of security versus a basic testnet level, what kinds of things do you have to set up, and what attackers or threats does that protect you from?
Cause I think that such a flexible technology is leaving people kind of far apart on what you have to do day-to-day.

I mean, if seriously the size of the blockchain is such a huge concern, then I might just code up an idea I have about that; I think personally that it's a huge distraction but people are getting wild ideas about how big or small things are or should, or can become, and it's like getting silly.

Ah I see, yeah I agree that there should not be, ideally, only one mega currency that everyone gets sucked into.
I like the idea of something like bitcoin as a universal, but I think that inside of a country they should probably have their own local currency area. I think for example that the USA has too few currencies, there should probably be more regional currencies and exchange rates between them.
That said, I personally benefit  (living in a blue state) from the currency imbalances in the USA.

AsicBoost is kind of bad, yes, but you can get it out in the open. Specifically there is a related vulnerability -- CVE-2017-9230
"The Bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm does not consider a certain attack methodology related to 80-byte block headers with a variety of initial 64-byte chunks followed by the same 16-byte chunk, multiple candidate root values ending with the same 4 bytes, and calculations involving sqrt numbers. This violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work function execution should be independent.

Why do you think Tether is a huge fraud? Why go through all the shenanigans of printed Tether and a parallel company to Bitfinex? It's just a token, and completely notional.
All these problems with Tether and bank wires are mostly caused by banks being little bitches when it comes to actually wiring money.
Any exchange at scale has these kinds of problems. If you wire money in and then try to wire money back out to accounts, banks hate that. Banks generally dislike moving money out from under their control. 
Imagine you are ING. From your cash settlement perspective, people are wiring in money, and sometimes wiring out money, but to them it all appears to "stand still". Notionally, out at Bitfinex, traders are buying and selling, and Bitfinex is "making" money on their internal books, as the trades earn them fees, basically taking an internal house rake.
To me, the biggest risk here is ING - Bitfinex could get hacked hard, or sued and go under - but Bitfinex did create a token when Bitfinex got hacked, and I think they paid everyone back ("paid" again, probably really just notionally, but some people probably did cash out through a bank wire from ING I guess).
The ING risk is that ING might decide, one day, to seize Bitfinex's cash balance. Maybe because a court told them to, maybe because "Compliance" told them to, maybe because the NY Fed won't take their wires (hah, right!) - so most likely loss of ING accounts would be government seizure.
This is just a case of the least dirty shirt. There has to be SOME way to get your dollars/euros/yen up and over so Bitfinex can pay their bills.
The funniest thing I see happening here is the clever regulatory arbitrage of Bitfinex - hanging out in Hong Kong, banking in the Netherlands, getting wires to and from NY. It's great.

Yeah but you (yes you!) could have created Facebook, at least gotten it started, if you had had the idea. So for early creators the returns, the ROI on it all, it's insane. Same with bitcoin. The early participants made literally insane ROI. That's just how it goes. 
There will be more opportunities in life, and you can make your own opportunities. So you don't have to chase bitcoin in a crazy hope for riches, you can just make them up out of thin air as a CEO with a dream. Take Elon Musk for example, he basically creates wealth by just saying out loud what he wants to do (yes, and doing it, as best he can). He keeps the public message simple and he attracts talent and capital to his causes (well, all of their causes, together actually). If you can find something that a good chunk of humanity wants to do, and issue the call, you will find that you can (together) do amazing things and get wealthy on the way.

True about mining on PCs makes it botnettable, just mean that it would be interesting to use a PC that is really unusual - like ... have memory hard problems where MOST of the PCs out there can't do it because they dont have 256GB of RAM, and use the amount of RAM as part of the "difficulty" - the amount of RAM, the amount of CPU, and number of hashes, and make it so that you can push and use a lot more of one or another .. ah its tricky I admit. 
I think it would also be interesting if you had to spread out your IP addresses, so that the world would see that too, and force things to spread out, literally decentralize, and play the messages over other services. 
It would be interesting to force together "mining" with decentralized communication. And pry away the control of both from centralized authoritarians. 
So that if they want to make "money" they have to give up centralized control. 
I admit I have an agenda on that, I just dont like authoritarian governments.

Yeah the specialized mining gear is a loss against decentralization. 
I wish there was a way that a miner could be something somewhat easy to get, but not standard equipment, and once it's been used for mining, can't go back ...
Example - GPUs. You couldn't make a botnet coin (and that's good) because normal people don't have specialist GPUs. But bad is that some people have lots of GPUs and they could choose to mine your currency to mess with it, then switch back to using them as graphics cards or whatever to defray their costs. You want the cost to get in to be a one way thing too.

Just relax and enjoy learning. Maybe get 2 cards. Then huddle in a small room with them all winter ;) In the summer, use them as graphics cards for some fun video games. There is this learning phase in mining that you have to make it through, and this would be a fun way through.

@_date: 2018-03-09 17:19:08
No, the parts go together. They're not letting you bid on 1 BTC, they're breaking it up into huge lots so they have less work to do. There's not really any reason to do that besides not wanting the hassle. But it's part of the overarching structure that preserves wealth. It's like if you had something that is naturally very divisible, like individual rare coins (each worth say $500), but the auction system says let's break this hoard up into 10 big pieces, each worth maybe $600k, and then auction that. That way they have less to do. It's basic bureaucratic half-assery, and the laziness serves the passive interests of the powers that be. They like that little guys can't participate. If we could, we could rock the price probably or at least make it match the market.

It definitely helps because at some point the bitcoin miners, who are constantly have to refresh and toss out hardware, are going to notice that the damn power plant they mine at has a 50 year life and is selling power - to them.
So one day, they have got to wake up and say - wait a second, why don't I get into the power plant business instead? Raw capital costs are very similar, just turn it inside out. Maybe they can't because of State politics. But that would be the idea.
Instead of installing a bunch of bitcoin miners, go make a solar array somewhere. Now get the power to civilization.

They think that a bunch of people in a police state are going to be free enough to have a community p2p currency, somehow in secret. 
It's not going to work that way. You have to have a country free enough in its politics for something like bitcoin to take effect. Bitcoin is an expression of a certain kind of politics. Those politics, done the bitcoin way, can only survive certain kinds of real world regimes.
A system of coin that used steganography and where a "rich list" is not possible because you can't follow the balances, is way superior to bitcoin. You would also need plausible deniability. Or the inability to definitely know your past transactions - at all. (Unless you took screenshots or something), and definitely not able to link them.
Mathematics and some brains will make all this possible. But the size of the blockchain is not relevant. Drones, slaves, zombies, or regular Joes in captive police state countries, or in Orwellian surveillance states, are always going to have a hard time having freedom money.
Bitcoin points the way. It's like the invention of the steam engine. It's all new to the world's thinking. It will be redefined. MAYBE that new thing will have direct roots to bitcoin. But it's just as likely it will be coded from the ground up with certain, new, political goals in mind.

It's not a bad idea. It's a punt on a cool tech. It has a good chance of going down to 1/2 the current price over the course of a year, a good chance of doubling, and a good chance of staying the same price. And being pretty volatile the whole way. 
I first got in because it seemed really interesting. And having some helped me learn more about it.
Over time, bitcoin has helped me understand wealth and power a little better, and helped me enjoy watching the limits of state power and what the little guy can do.
I also think it will really help you develop scam radar. Be sure to keep your bitcoin either offline in cold storage or ... just offline somewhere safe it you choose to memorize seed values or something. Leaving it on an exchange opens you to a lot of risk.

I don't understand your argument exactly. Can you elaborate? 
I assume you mean that almost no one paid the WannaCry ransom, and that therefore that means bitcoin has low low value, and is therefore not going to replace - iTunes gift cards or something - anytime soon?
EDIT: Ah, nevermind, I understand you now. You're making a fungibility argument - that the WannaCry coins are tainted (actually apparently already exchanged for Monero). So uh okay?

It depends. In a lot of places bureaucrats are trying to provide some kind of power to entire municipalities or industries and want to attract jobs but DONT want it to be well-connected to the grid (because they want local jobs) - this over capacity, brought on by bureaucrats, is what crypto mining goes to exploit.
If they add the UHV lines to get the power into the grid efficiently, then where the electricity is made wouldn't matter as much. If they stop trying to subsidize cheap power, it wouldn't matter what people use it for. Etc.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:52:55
I think a better way of thinking of black swans are those unforseen events that sink everything.
Mayyyyybe at this point bitcoin exploding upwards in value and crushing fiat, etc, that might not quite be a black swan anymore, but more like a very unlikely but very extreme possibility, which has immensive upside or downside (I wouldn't say 'ruin) but is like a tail risk. 
Tail risks are interesting, and because bitcoin is so risky, the good thing is that probably these risks are priced in. So ... that's kind of a good thing. A lot of things have more hidden risks or people think or act like there are no risks, and it's not so obvious that you are getting adequately paid to take them on (Greek, Argentinian, Iraqi bonds)
So ... it's possible that there will be a revolution in finance, but ... as far as bitcoin as a currency goes, it might be a while until the financial world sees it in the same light as they do the Swiss Franc but it's ... going to take a while.
The big potential, for bitcoin to disrupt a lot more, like store records of value - and not just be a money - that could be 100x bigger, but not necessarily boost bitcoin's price, even if the value of bitcoin goes up a lot.
Okay, well anyway, buy a bit, 5-10%, what is safe for you. Bitcoin is pretty cool.
Don't play Russian roulette with your finances, especially if you have a family depending on you. Don't get wiped out. If bitcoin goes up enough in value, cash out a little so you're playing with 'house money'. Don't get wiped out.

It's totally fine, do what you want to. You are doing well, good on you.
By the way, I think it's great that you can use their work.  I would (MAYBE) believe in it even more if I found out that they were following their own advice. But I would also not be surprised if someone saw the same pattern, and kept it to themselves. Why share it with us, if it's this genius way to make money? Is it to get us to notice their names and gain confidence in them, and so maybe they want a steady position and money, and social capitol, more than they want to be anonymous and wealthy? (So in a lot of ways they don't share my values. The work I do slowly trained me to stop talking about what exactly I do, and I realized that a lot of people are con men and publicity hounds, once you yourself stop trying to be famous.) 
Next, if a thesis starts with ideas like "bitcoin will fall to zero, because it has no intrinsic value" - then I have already tuned them out. Their premise is that things have intrinsic value. I think that things don't. There are of course ordinary things like food, water, air, that we NEED but past that, a lot of value is subjective. What's the value of a bar of gold, or a parachute? It would depend on the situation. So past that, the further down you go down the line of economic thinking, you realize that sometimes you are just chatting up symantics. 
Next, I don't believe in chart reading, beyond very broad market biases in a direction. So bitcoin is heading up. Past that, where it stops and if it crashes, levels out, or goes much higher, that's all guess work. I don't think it's a bubble, I think it's a new asset class entirely and off we go.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:41:32
That's interesting.
On one of my alts here on reddit long ago, I had suggested a geographical layout for nodes based on  triangles, starting with an icosahedron and then breaking it down with triangles from there.
You could fake the lag, but you couldnt fake how fast your latency was, eventually if you had low earth orbit satellites, with good technology, you could tell that someone really was approximately where they said their node was...
"A geodesic sphere is to surround the planet, and every moon and planet our descendants travel to.
The sphere is made up of GPS coordinates that lock in triangular regions across the surface.
And triangles can be tessellated into smaller and smaller triangles, allowing the surface to be broken up into regions, countries, states, cities, counties, suburbs, streets, houses.
The level of tesselation is controlled by a transaction tax.
However it could also be controlled by the level of transactions passing between nearby peer nodes.
I'll be going into more of this in a later post."
Similar to that he's posting there, kind of.

DoS attacks are an interesting problem.
It seems like what they rely on is that someone has to put just a little effort in, and they can cause denial of service when the server/service has to do a big response, or accidentally responds to a fake, and things like that.
Is there some sort of technology where we could make it really expensive for someone to get that initial connection to you, but it would be really easy to tell that they were faking it, trying to waste your time?
I saw an idea for this one weird Usenet site, where you had to make your CPU do a lot of work in order to submit material, and that seemed to help keep spam down.
I think it was called "hashcash" but maybe some ideas like that, maybe could stop Denial of Service.
Maybe someone could put some amount of "money" or hashcash or something in escrow in some way.
The downside is it becomes a bit of a "pay to play" system but the upside is it should help deter spammers / DoS / DDoS
Maybe the system could incentivize them to play fair, and like help out.
God if only, "if only" there was such a fucking technology.
I know it might be really hard to do, but I would love to be involved in some sort of solution.

OH sure, there are adopters from 2011 selling too.
This is all a real-time play out of Coase's Theorem:
"if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property."
So I take it to mean, and I hope I'm not mis-applying the theorem: it doesn't matter that the initial distribution of bitcoin went to early adopters. Someone had to be early, and other people will be late. In the end, they are still human beings who have to manage their risk and pay the bills and live their lives. So they will spend money on houses, used Ford Tauruses, stupid t-shirts, alpaca socks and pizza, and in the end, bitcoin will be re-distributed to latecomers who want to add some uncorrelated risk/return to their portfolios.

If the US dollar gave people financial freedom: financial privacy, could not be seized, send to anyone, global, supply limited - fixed - knowable in advance, better than gold - then we might not need bitcoin.
But as long as what you have can be taken, inflated away, not sent where you want, not private, then you have gold and cryptos and other like things to fill in the gap. 
Part of the reality of bitcoin is that it takes real world resources to get it. It will always use electricity and it will be fought by groups that blame bitcoin for what is essentially probably their own government stealing from them.

Why idolize Warren Buffet though? The main contribution I think he made is he buys businesses but keeps the people who seem to know how to run it, has GEICO to use the liquidity of that business to help fund the rest, spreads out into lots of industries, and takes a long view.
But hates bitcoin and is just an irrational old guy on the issue. The only part of his view that's correct is that he doesn't understand bitcoin and stays out. Past that, he's not so clever.
I like his newsletter.
If you want to be like Buffet or anyone rich, there's just a few simple rules - borrowing from Ben Stein here too - don't take responsibility for anything that eats, take a long term view, only invest in what you understand, don't let FOMO drive your investing, don't let hope be an investment strategy, and don't be a sucker, and split your investments between the bulk which is really safe investments, and then have some amount maybe 10% in risky investments (where the risk premium is priced in) - avoid middle ground risks, and there's more to life than money so try to keep up with your friends and relatives; invest in yourself, since that isn't something that you can lose or have taken away; you can't really get rich unless you don't need the money; money goes where it's wanted and stays where it's well treated.

oh my god :) none probably, it's a really obvious scam. 
But let me help by explaining how to figure out if something is a scam, since it's a generally valuable skill. 
First, obviously, dont beat up the victims, but here's some signs:
* huge red flag, doesnt describe how they make money
* yellow flag, they claim to have a way to make money off the market with like a proprietary trading system etc, like Madoff, or here some kind of trading bot is claimed
* unrealistic returns - for Madoff, steady returns even if the markets were up or down, or here for bitconnect 1% interest per day
* guaranteed returns - no no no (Fed T bills are widely not considered scams so call them an exception if you want)
A very common trap is any kind of exchange or system where you LEND your bitcoin. Any of that nonsense will almost certainly end in tears. They almost always have you send in bitcoin, then show you some screen with pretty numbers going UP UP UP until one day you are locked out and they exit scam with your bitcoin. Those weren't bitcoins, those weren't dollars, that wasn't gains, that was a scam the whole time.
What these sites take advantage of is that when people buy bitcoin in hope it goes up in value - rather than to do cool programming, solve a problem or need they have, then I would say 90% of them are not comfortable stopping there with the speculative risk of bitcoin value going up or down. Instead they think "hey this bitcoin is just sitting here - and it really could go up and down; I am out of cash (have put too much in) and I need this bitcoin to become more bitcoin - wow did you say I could LEND it???"  Then they send their bitcoin off and its bye bye

Someone forgot to tell him that 1TB drives cost $100. 
The problem of "waste" or cost in resources in bitcoin is not in storage space or network bandwith memory or cpu- its in electricity to mine and in mining hardware.
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:28:56
Your analogies are basically right, I would modify these bits:


A bitcoin is not a store of value, but unlike fiat, it cannot be wished into existance (unless you start over with a new cryptocurrency with new rules) - bitcoins have to be mined, and that takes electricity and resources. So you can't just give yourself more, you have to trade for them, or make them. You can't "copy and paste" these digital items, unlike most digital things.
The store of value part of bitcoin is still murky-ish. They're worth something, to some people. gold as a "store of value" is just a cross-cultural and deep store of value through time. gold does not have intrinsic worth, but situationally, it's useful (like gold plating something so that it resists corrosion). People make jewelry out of gold, because it's a nice looking way of showing you're wealthy (because the gold itself is worth something), and it makes it portable, and adds an artistic touch.
Bitcoin is not a scam for fraud. At MOST it's a "natural Ponzi" meaning, the late comers have a choice: buy into bitcoin and pay off the earlier adopters (the Ponzi part, in their mind), make your own cryptocurrency and while you're at it, fix something you didn't like about bitcoin and enrich yourself doing it (Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash), scam people brutally (thousands of lame coins), or stay on the sidelines waiting and waiting for Bitcoin 2.0 issued by a trusty bank or government etc (the status quo).

Eh, I think that it just means that if you have two things you could buy with, and it would have meant something like a pure silver coin labelled "$1 dollar", and a debased half-silver coin labelled "$1 dollar" - then you would buy things and pay your debts and taxes in the debased coin.
So that means that you never spend the quality money. So bad money drives out good means that, if I think bitcoin is better than dollars, then I should not be surprised if people choose to hold and buy bitcoin but are very reserved about spending it. They will spend, if they have to, but it won't be their first choice to spend it.

I think that the main thing that would prevent bitcoin itself from being that currency that you get loans and the like in, is that it's too valuable to use for that.

Nodes outside datacenters will have a hard time being full nodes. Eh, and a bit more disk space needed.
Mostly not an issue, but this sub goes round and round about it.
A version of bitcoin with larger blocks - is slightly more expensive to store; is slightly easier for older bitcoin apps that were used to lower fees to use; does not require a lot of space-efficient economization techniques; is harder to keep up on the bandwidth requirements maybe (if all the blocks are full) - which might drive people, long term, into using the faster connects available at datacenters - which might defeat the decentralization - as datacenters could be co-opted by enemies of bitcoin.

But I couldn't justify doing that :)
I even saw the announcement on slashdot that bitcoin was a $1, didn't understand how it could be money, and did Folding @ home instead. I could have bought 500 then (but didn't)

Well even in the remotest corner of China where they have huge hydro dams and cheap electrical power, they can surely pay some money to trench some fiber.
The ones that are truly butthurt by this are those that have been with bitcoin since the beginning, and who link the concept of a full node to freedom - they long ago gave up on running any mining.
The inevitable reality of ever-faster fiber optics speeds (doubling in speeds every 9 months - approximately a 10x increase every 3 years) - means that data center fiber optics connections are going to be so much faster than home connections (except maybe, fiber to the home) - that it will drive full nodes into datacenters.

He probably lost his secret keys, which is embarrassing as hell, but it happens. I give this about a 30% chance.
Or lost a wallet in a crash, or accidentally deleted it and had no backup and therefore would be embarrassed. I give this about a 16% chance.
Also possible that he simply died. I give this a maybe 50% chance.
Also, there's a very small chance that he literally did believe in decentralization and walked away. 1% chance.
Or he was genuinely afraid of the powers that be, and Gavin talking to the CIA scared him off. Maybe 2% chance of that. This is where he bowed out because he didn't want to be assassinated. 
And a small chance that bitcoin was built by a secret committee of people who coded it and set it loose. 1% chance.

How I kind of wish this worked was that a website could have an ad channel -- and put into that channel something like: 
402 Payment Required
And then below that, some kind of bitcoin address, the amount they want, or maybe other networks, like Brave, a Lightning Network channel, ... a Netflix subscription, or something, some way to pay, and if you *cant*
Then give them the ad. 
Now the people with "free ad blockers", in the long run, this isn't going to work. The sites are going to work harder and harder to make it so you see ads. They'll just have to do the equivalent of making the pattern that is an ad very hard to decode.
or, if they have to, to make you see ads, the whole page will be a canvas they draw on, blowing all these nice HTML and CSS specs out of the water.
Anyway, long run, you'll either see ads, or be a subscriber to the site and not see ads, or not visit the site.

I really respect that you are a scientist and that you lean on other scientists.
I didn't like bitcoin at $1 because I had orthodox political and economic views. At about $500 each, I facepalmed and backtracked and realized that right or wrong, this had a lot of room to grow in my opinion. North of $500k a bitcoin there I think things are a huge maybe.
I wish it wasn't true, but my trading action is all emotion driven. I think it's actually pretty funny, but there's nothing I can do about it. If I could pith that part of my brain the trades on emotion, I would think hard about the side effects. Anyway. What I've learned is that whenever bitcoin gets really valuable (and I dont realize it at the time, but it is over-valued) - thats when I usually ramp up my security a notch - to "protect" my bitcoin from theft. What I should do instead is sell at those points. But I don't, I usually go crazy and add another layer of security. Okay anyway ;)
Oh, in stock investing, I just use index funds, because I have no way to really evaluate companies very well. I look at their 10Q's but it's greek to me, so I just leave it. I have a few individual stocks, overall I'm fine.

You don't, you don't need to.
Imagine that you could have dollars, but could pay taxes in toilet paper. Uh, why would you spend dollars doing that when you could spend toilet paper?
It's Gresham's Law. Bad money drives out good. So what that means is that if the government takes toilet paper as payment for taxes, you can keep your dollars. You would be an idiot to send them dollars if you could write "$1 dollar $1" on toilet paper to pay them.
So that's the suffering (you can google "woody harrelson crying money") that I'm going through with bitcoin. Poor me, unable to spend my bitcoin because it's appreciating in value too fast.
Whatever. Don't care. I wish it would be a currency but like you say, I can't because it goes up too fast. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:58:24
Yeah its true that the mark of how old our account is is an easy target for bitcoin gatekeeping.
But our problem is that a better alternative, like a signed message that proves you actually controlled some bitcoin, that's not in place.
I wish that you could have proof of skin in the game.
Here we have the age of your account, or the little "books" icon of a bitcoin dev.
(like something where you used an vanity generator to make a test destination address that locks your bitcoin for a year and sends back to some other "you specify here" address when the timelock is done ... that way no one could sanely "loan" a puppet account some bitcoin just for these proofs - they could be robbed)
THEN I think we would see more fantastic commentary by people who actually have staked for commenting something like 100, 10, 1, or 1/10th of a bitcoin.
Because we are just harassed here by people spouting poop constantly shitting on this project, and they have actually no economic interest in it succeeding.

The future is here but it comes so unevenly... 
My university had SecurID tokens and all that, and I found some Russian code so we could make up our own ACE server if we wanted ... but  yeah some people didn't know that existed.
I remember back in the day playing around with coding my own versions of DES and 3DES in C, with my own homemade code, on a VAX :) just to try making up my own functions based on the manuals description of the functions since I had nothing to actually do encryption (circa 1992-1995?) so I assume other people were out playing with ideas.
I'm surprised kind of that people didn't make something like bitcoin earlier actually. Hmm. I wonder if the ideas have been around since the late 1980s but just sat dormant.

I could see it allowing a 49.5% attack instead of a 50% attack. But a block withholding attack is already a known thing. Having an inadvertent block withholding attack because of network lag or blocksize isn't ideal but I don't buy for a second the idea that you have these huge mining farms in the middle of nowhere and they can't pay to trench some fiber optics from a nearby line.
EDIT: I'm trying to say that a block withholding attack is already a known thing, and lag propagation either because of poor bandwidth, big blocks, or other reasons are just accidental versions of something that could be done deliberately. Yes I understand that meta that if blocks are larger then lag becomes slightly a thing. But just to test this, you do understand that a megabyte is only 1/1024th of a gigabyte right? (About a tenth of 1% of the size). I, on a very very terrible home line have typical latencies of 50ms to most of the US, and 250ms to Germany (1/4 of a second). My download speed is pretty comfortable on DSL at home and I can download a very large video game (50gigs or so) in about 10 hours. That's not fast by the way. So I can download a gigabyte in about 12 minutes. Sorry for all this math. But my point is that the difference between a 1mb block or an 8mb block in latency and bandwidth are both really small. They're literally just an edge case here.

Prices in the future get weird. 
Mainly technology helps people adapt... but sometimes it hits walls and costs go up and up.
So example, healthcare, higher ed, and housing have been going up in cost.
But the price of toasters is way down.
And cars and laptops work way better than they used to but they don't seem less expensive.
So it can be kind of hard to compare past prices to possible future prices.

Offtopic, I remember back when bitcoin was ~$300 and I sent like 1/10 of a bitcoin to my brother as a demo. And to me, it just seemed to be taking so long to confirm, hours and hours, that I always wondered if the laptop I was using (not my regular equipment) was compromised .... 
So I could see something like this happen to me if I swept one of my paper wallets. I don't really go for the hardware wallets or anything but the devices themselves that I use to do a sweep, I could see how those could get compromised.
So it might be secure-ish in cold storage, but lost as soon as I swept it. Hmm.

It's easier for an exchange to have a bank account with each bank and for their members to pay you and get paid without bank wires.
Once a customer has paid you, or you pay a customer, money hasnt left that banks pocket. 
From the banks point of view all is good. 
Behind the scenes you can now use Tether to move value around internationally. 
At exchanges where its hard to get money out, Tether can be valuable. Where its easier to get money out, the market has the price of Tether be more normal.
Last, in this day and age I am skeptical that there could ever be a Tether without problems.
Tether exists and has problems because of banks.

A black swan is partially a logical problem
People are taking what they've seen or seen historically as if its the whole entire thing, and they are not taking into account what they have not yet seen but what could happen
So even when people generally thought that all swans were white, some people - a few - realized that potentially, somewhere, there could literally be a black swan.
And eventually one was literally found but it's more of a logical thing than a physical thing
So the real world example:  in WW1, I bet the worst war anyone could think of would be the Napoleon wars. But that's hindsight. WW1 was terrible.  WW2 was worse. What will WW3 be like? It will be UNEARTHLY levels of horrible - WW2 and WW3 will not be in the same league of destruction. It will be civilization-ending.
People who know about black swans as an idea don't look only backwards to what has happened before and do some linear expectation or expect more of the same or the past, nor do they get lulled to sleep by the current level of 'peace' - they know the potential for something HUGE to happen.
Same in stock markets, bitcoin vs fiat, all that stuff.
This is just my view of black swans.

Well, for better or worse, that's the idea of Proof of Stake in a way. You don't have to have miners, you could just have nodes. They have a stake in the system, and have to be online to get their share, etc.
But I have to admit that I don't understand the technical and economic details of Proof of Stake. I hear about 'Nothing at Stake' as an issue, and since I don't fully understand, I've personally tried to shy away from PoS coins.
Exchanges *could* participate and have a huge amount of coins at stake, so maybe that would fit what you've described.
I know that we can all see how bitcoin mining takes specialized ASICS to do well, and how it's concentrating mining, putting it maybe a bit out of reach of ordinary people etc. Proof of Stake does flip that around. I think the question is - are the costs of running a node a form of 'Something at Stake'?  In that -an actual node able to store a really big blockchain, and the bandwidth costs, does that amount to an actual resource (like bitcoin mining takes electricity) - just to participate?  I think it might ... because disk allocated to storing one blockchain can't store another ... ? But the problem might be the way hashes of blocks kind of "compress" the situation. Hmm. Have to think it over. Better minds than me have probably thought this through more.

Sure, side conversation for a second though... usually people say about investors/speculators etc, that they are driven by fear and greed.
I would say that sure maybe those emotions are there, but there's I think a couple of other less obvious factors - one of them is disappointment (which is milder than fear) and grass is greener (which is milder than greed).  Those things are the reasons I do things like buy or sell different stocks and get into or out of different indexes.
When you couple that with a return to the mean, it often means that people are selling when things are disappointing, right before it returns to a mean, and buying after things have already run up and it falls, returning to the mean. Also, obviously, you could do things like chase a losing stock about to go bankrupt, not see the obvious run for the exits, and left holding a stock with a Q on the ticker (delisted). Oops. So you don't want to naively sell whatever is doing well to buy whatever has been doing badly. You do have to speculate though, since, in theory, the market collectively has all the information.
Now bitcoin doesn't have an average, it's all new. So it's been in takeoff mode for years now and it's not really obvious what the altitude will be. For me the moon was back at $1k, so this is all deep space for me.

I'm with you Frog - 
No one cares if they buy in or don't; this "coin-purtunity" is obviously going to pass them by, but it's kind of their own choice doing this. But you're okay with that, I'm okay with that, I don't know why they're here.
And if they say "well the technology", that's like reading Playboy for the articles.
Some things with bitcoin become possible (like buying houses, buying corporations, buying and selling Ukraine's annual wheat production, etc etc, the bigger bitcoin gets in price and value.) So unlike the supporters that ONLY think the tech matters, the price matters too.
If bitcoins were still fractions of a cent each, it would not be as relevant.

Think of bitcoin as a game - 
The people at the table (all of you) are miners. Imagine you're at a busy coffee shop, people are coming and going every few seconds, ordering coffee, paying and going.
Each one of those transactions though - you're all checking it. Do they have the balance to pay? If not, you ignore the transaction - its not valid. If it is valid, you throw it in a hat.
For sake of argument, the hat holds a finite number of transactions.
Next, everyone rolls dice in their own dice tower. First person to get 5 1's on 10 dice calls "coinbase!" and gets 12.5 bitcoin creditted to them.
All the transactions in that person's hat go through. Everyone else removes any transactions that were in that person's hat, ... eh
Now we do this all day, all night, for two weeks. After two weeks, if we gave out too much bitcoin, we raise the number of dice they have to roll in a row - say up to 6 dice. If it's about right we keep it the same. If it was too slow we make it easier and lower it to 4 dice.
That's the closest easiest analogy I can think of.
Anyone can be a miner, dice cost $10k each, real USD, and every day you play, you pay lets say $100 for each dice.
Now, obviously, the number of dice you roll (how much mining you do) depends on how much bitcoin is actually worth, or what you think it will be worth.
You can see how busy the coffee shop is, is bitcoin going to be worth more?

Think of the logic of bandwidth though.
Fiber optics double in speed about every 9 months. So in about 3 years, you have 10x the bandwidth.
Home connections though do not increase in speed so quickly. I think they double much slower but I don't have a number, about every 4 years?
So it doesn't take long, lets say two decades, before the bandwidth you can get at a datacenter is 100x faster than a home connection.
So at some point, nodes have to migrate to datacenters where they have lots of bandwidth.
Let me know if you need me to source these estimates.
If you think home users should be running nodes over DSL, I kind of agree and I wish that they could. I wish that home users had fiber to the home or better, rocking 10gig uplinks or better.
Separate issues:
I think blockchain diskspace is a non-problem though. 
I think overly worrying about mempool is not a huge huge issue. You just put a fair amount of memory towards it, save the transactions with big fees or old age or whatever mix you want to remember, and then wait for a block to come out from a miner.
My larger point is:
Full nodes cost something to run - price of the box itself, disk, CPU, memory, bandwidth. What do you think it should cost a year to run a full node? That's the real question. I think some number between 1/10th and 1 bitcoin a year.

It's like if Litecoin went down to $10 each, I mean why not? It's still a fairly large coin. At some point it's just rational to be short-term interested in the price versus current value. Not saying whether or not bitcoin cash or litecoin ever become the main cryptocurrency.

"Next Phase Expected to Double Processing Power to Over 5 PetaHash HARRISON, N.Y., Sept. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MGT), today reported that its previously announced large scale Bitcoin mining operation has reached full phase one production output with a larger than expected 2.6 PetaHash of processing power. At the present difficulty level, the facility is mining over 90 Bitcoin per month with a value of $55,000. The company is already preparing modifications to expand its processing power to approximately 5.2 PetaHash by the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company's current goal for this facility is to increase the processing capacity to nearly over 10 PetaHash."

Something that sucks and is working against our community is that fiber optic speeds are doubling every 9 months - so data centers are getting faster and faster bandwidth. But home users are on a way slower increase (I forget the pace of improvement, but its closer to years). So if you give it a decade, datacenters become 10x faster than a home user's connection. This makes data centers attractive for some coins, but might be a trap for something like bitcoin. 
Dash's staking model for example, is going to presume some nice always on connection, and a lot of people use virtual machines in data centers for that I think. But it's going to be easy to go to a few datacenters, get Intel, and then seize virtual machines. It risks the decentralization.
Ideally, small mobile ubiquitous computers like our phones could run bitcoin. And MAYBE someday they actually could. You just have to imagine reasonable bandwidth, a few terabytes of storage on the phone, and a few gigs of RAM in the phone. And decent phone security, which is the hardest part.

Well sure, blocksize is going to eat bandwidth, and so will - even more - the other things out there that want to download from your node.
It seems like a really cheap "attack" on a node to just request blocks and then throw them away and request another and another ... or find some attack to get nodes to request blocks from each other over and over. Hmm.
Well anyway, I think the weakness of the node is the operating costs.

Hard to say, here's a link to an old bitcoin value calculator. I ran it lately and when I did bitcoin seemed overvalued, now I'd say it might be a little undervalued today. Up to you though to run the numbers. I'd say that "the Market" collectively determines what it thinks today's prices are. You have to decide for yourself, and over what timeframe, you want to estimate the value.
(I basically buy whenever I think it's undervalued. Sudden price crashes make me break out my wallet, but to be fair, I tend to buy in a little too fast when it's dropping and I should spread out those spends in chunks like over maybe a 3 week period.)

I think they should have just made an altcoin with bigger blocks. Heck, pad the blocks. The point is, some people feel left out. They think that bigger and bigger blocks will price them out of being a node and having a say in how bitcoin goes.

Like "I sell BTC - only to investors - for cash" ?
I mean, it's starting to seem like the powers that be only want us to be able to sell in large blocks to over the counter groups like to Barry Silbert.
Like, it's totally not going to work to sell bitcoins, 1/20th of a bitcoin amounts etc, to individuals, and use that to "unwind" into fiat if you need to.

Eh, Satoshi seemed to back away after Gavin Andreesen went to chat with the CIA. Also, Satoshi did not like Wikileaks taking bitcoin and felt that that attention was bad for his project. He obviously bailed out and disappeared. I think, personally, that he lost his private keys or died, and has walked away or obviously can't talk anymore.
Craig Wright, god only knows, probably got into this as a project and convinced people privately that he was Satoshi so that he could get funding for things, and tax breaks. But I don't know how much he has to show for it, and his government (Austrailia?) was coming after him over it. So then in this muddle, if he tries to prove more widely that he's Satoshi, then the heat will leave him alone. I think that part of his ruse is to sign a transaction and make you think he must be Satoshi and that therefore all the bitcoins out there that people think are Satoshi's (10,000+? forget the exact number) - are "collateral" for wacky business ideas (scams). So basically, he's conning people.
I want to be careful and say that I have NO Evidence for my beliefs, I just connect the dots like anyone can. .I don't want to be accused of libel or slander or anything. I'm just saying, if this was a book, that's how I'd read the made up character. Maybe it's all lies? What do I know? In anything bitcoin, you just have to be super wary.

Well as soon as graphics cards makers start making and supplying cryptocurrency oriented graphics cards - like ones that hash fast and don't have a lot of "video" options that miners dont need - and supply them in quantities direct to miners who want 10+ cards, then all will be well.
But if graphics cards makers think cryptocurrency miners are the enemy then there will be conflict.
They just have to make two different kinds of cards now. Or people have to switch to console gaming (BLEH). (PC gamer here)

Anyone can make a fork of bitcoin, you, me, anyone.
A reason to do it would be to jumpstart adoption.
It sounds like what bitcoin gold (btcg) wants to do is replace the SHA256 with some other GPU-friendly algorithm, in order to shut out ASIC miners.
You would automatically get some if you already have bitcoin and the private keys to that. (Like on a paper wallet, or out on your own node/wallet, or on a Trezor etc). 
The devil's in the details, but yes it's annoying that there's these different forks of bitcoin instead of just another altcoin that could live or die on its own merits.

If a group of countries, like OPEC, collectively issued a token, and claimed that those tokens were redeemable for a barrel of oil anywhere in the world, okay, that would be worth something.
But if a single not very trustworthy government wants to claim that its Petro token is backed by oil, that's a lot shakier. It would still be worth *something* but it's really not as good, since we have to trust them, plus *backing* is a bit of a red herring, since the real issue is trust with the issuer.

Then it should be enough RAM that you couldn't easily botnet it, and enough CPU too that same difference, ideally something you can't "Amazon coin" nor something that only eats GPUs.
I wonder what that would be ... hmm.

I don't think either of those things. Neither the courts nor the IRS will be kind to those that try to dodge them.
In fact, I have dealt with the legal system before and I was mildly amazed at how much a judge could order. It was pretty interesting but I won't go into it. I was not on the wrong end of their judgements. But they could make literally anything happen.
If you had a court order that money should go from this guys 401k to that guys 401k, it will basically happen. They call stuff like that a "quadro" - a QRDO - but form or no fucking form, if a judge orders it, it is done. (Or appealed, to a higher court).
And if you get in trouble with the IRS, my advice is to get an attorney and find a way to do what your attorney recommends, which is probably what the IRS is asking for you to do.
This is just the world of grown ups, not 5 year olds. My point is that 5 year olds think they can evade the court system in a divorce.

I think it's an interesting story that they had about 40k bitcoins in MtGox purchased at around $250k, so they paid maybe on the order of $6 per bitcoin as their basis. Then MtGox closed up in February 2014 I think... and they lost that.
Then they had to buy in, and they got about 30k bitcoins from the Silk Road auction, didn't they have to pay about $600 each for those? I remember it was something. 
If someone can fact check me on this, that'd be cool.
Anyway, point is, poor guy had to buy in again at 100x his original basis. 
I think that's actually harder to do than holding.

Yeah you would have to take 100 years to swap over to it, you would need broad public support, etc.
The idea is called 'Georgism'
You have to make the assessed value "fair" (I have ideas about how to do that)
And you might want to carve out exceptions or subsidies for someones personal home, ancestral homes, parks, farms, etc.
If you do it right, there's no tax evasion. It's not possible. 
You could still all kinds of frauds and diversions of public funds - but that's a separate problem.
Taxing real estate is a tax that ultimately gets transferred to the consumers of whatever the land produces, or however those users use it. It makes the usage of land much more efficient. 
You could make it so that you only tax the values of homes above the median price.

Okay, now make up another addressing scheme, and another, and another and another, and 1000x more, and maybe at some point it dawns on you: NOBODY WANTS ANOTHER FUCKING VERSION
They just want the main one - because of network effects.

(Eh I wrote a great big essay, let me shorten it):
You can't avoid latency issues to the other side of the world. They are going to be at least something like 200 ms, plus the time for nodes to do the thinking and forwarding etc.
Let's just say that you can cut your bandwidth by a lot by not sending over whole blocks, just the messages, which you already have most of.
Whatever messages the node on the other side of the world is missing, you can send those. You could have a whole back and forth conversation about, with all the latency, faster than you could transmit the great big block.
So it's an improvement and blocksize is not important for latency. Because you're not passing whole blocks. You're saying "found a block, contains the messages you already know about, here's the hash". The other node says "I must be missing some messages, here's my Bloom filter", then the first node says "you're missing these two", "awesome thanks, I confirm I have it all now and the hash matches what you sent me ~500ms ago thanks." -- and they're done faster than you could've transmitted the actual block.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:27:42
Yep, the coordinated attack time gets buried 12 blocks deep, in theory, so it's so exponentially difficult to undo and redo, that they can count on it being good enough to coordinate.
An attacker would have a lot of proof of work to undo. Maybe possible if they have secret amazing hardware? But otherwise, not really possible.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:51:45
If he really was Satoshi, and competent, he could just sign his own coins and move one of the first few blocks to somewhere else. That'd be proof enough.
But, if he's SN, and lost his keys, then he can't.
And if he's not SN, and doesn't have the keys, then hey, he's lying.
Also, very small chance, he's not SN, but does have SN's keys, and that'd be intriguing.
Also, very very very small chance, he could know some bug in bitcoin that let's him move coins around or sign things for real.
Largest chance, that it's all made up and his private proofs to people that he's Satoshi are just BS on some weird homebrew situation that he uses to fool people.

Not necessarily ...
Warren Buffet has a quote about how he sees huge opportunities. My recollection is that he could take a million dollars and make 100% in a year on it.
Citing Wikiquote:
"If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I'd be fully invested. Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I've ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that. "
Ah rats, I can't find the real quote or story I'm thinking of.
But his main point was that million dollar opportunities are literally everywhere around people, they just don't see them.
That said, my spin on that is that there are also 99 to 1 horrible scams ready to take peoples money. Not just things you see in bitcoin, altcoins and ICOs. But other things like multilevel marketing, stupid investment ideas like Florida swamp real estate, vending machines, timeshares, owning an RV / boat / airplane, and other doofy wastes of money (the boat, RV, airplane, flash car might be someone's "thing" though, so I kind of let that slide, as those aren't really investments but money sinks - or really fun, so whatever, to be fair.)

Well I think you have to decide as a community what the cost of a full node "should" be, and the prices and latency/bandwidth of network connections.
Straw man argument (not what your'e saying, but a more extreme example): there comes a point where maybe repurposing a Roku into a node and doing it over Morse code from Antarctica and hoping people living on under a dollar a day can make it work, that's not realistic.
I personally think that a $500 to $1000 full node, and bandwidth costs around $50/month, are the right price for a node. But if that seems too much, then people should use SPV.
If you're a big exchange, a big miner, or a data miner, or really really paranoid, then you need your own node.
I think that the interesting thing is what $1000 can buy you each year has always been improving dramatically.
Also, let's not underestimate advances like xthin

Okay. Let me just pause and say that I can see why, given the CURRENT way things work, with bitcoin, bitcoin cash and probably 99.9999999% of the altcoins out there, why people see it this way.
BUT - and I've been thinking about this for a while. You could make up a coin that had a set max blocksize, let's say 1 megabyte. And like bitcoin a once every ten minutes target. If it fills, it's 51 gigs a year.
Give it 100 years of space, make it a "ring" instead of a chain, and now you know *in advance* that the blockchain will take just over 5 terabytes - and "that's it".  Right now that'd be a $500 dollar SATA drive, but in a few years, it's $100 for sure, and the price will keep going down since disk space growth scales really well.
No more "spam" - it's all predetermined how much disk space a ring chain would take and after 100 years you write right over the top of the Genesis block and forget the old coins. 
Move em or lose em.
I should make that coin. 
Anyway, you could make a "1 year" coin as a proof of concept. It would take something like a few gigs of space, forever, never growing.
Then people could stop worry about spam since it's a non-issue and really always has been.

You can and you can't. Scammers have sometimes wrapped tungsten with gold and that can trick people for long enough that they get away with it. Good supply chain management, storage, etc, are part of the price of having to secure gold.
Density tests, chemical tests, or just malleability tests, can all reveal fake gold. Like you can twist open some of these fake gold bars and see the tungsten inside. Or drill a test into a gold bar. Or chemically test, with acids, some sandpapered off "gold". 
Gold is still gold, so you don't need to fear twisting open a gold bar to check it. If it's real gold, it's still worth a lot. If it's fake, it's fake.

Some people think that bitcoin uses "too much" electricity.
But in reality, bitcoin will be mined wherever electrical prices are low. It's low where the energy is going to be produce but low-priced because they can't really get it to market.
Usually it will be some bureaucrats that approved a hydro dam in the middle of nowhere and also without the ultra high voltage lines to get it to market.
So they fantasize that someone will smelt aluminum there with the cheap electricity and bring jobs, GDP growth and cheap materials for industry to out of the way locations. 
When actually, it's a big waste of money because megawatts do not equal GDP.
So as to which is better, an electricity supplier has no real opinion on what you use the electricity for - to make aluminum foil or to mine bitcoin. Either way, it uses their electricity and can make a powerplant profitable or defray their costs.
Bitcoin mining rigs (ASICs) become technologically obsolete fairly fast, so hopefully as bitcoin miners find and are allowed to stay at places with renewable energy, they will in time drift and realize that things like solar panels last a long time, and bitcoin mining rigs only last a short while, but the price of bitcoin will be tied to the price of energy, and maybe in the long run, they are better off being reusable energy producers themselves...
So we'll see. People think bitcoin is the end of the world, and don't see that actually it's bureaucrats ruining everything.

Eh, I mean Turing completeness isn't that difficult. 
I think that the individual transactions language, Script, is not Turing complete, or isn't trying to be.
But since you can do transaction after transaction, you could probably make one script call another over time, and make up something.
It's kind of not worth worrying about imho.

American Banker opinion, "Money Laundering is Financial Thoughtcrime":

Some of the policing role that middlemen were playing might come back partly, not as middlemen, but as reputation systems - so you can figure out who to trust, or who is a fair dealer.

Like when Obama-era banking de-banked what was it, got rid of bank accounts for check cashing places and (I forget) strippers or strip clubs or something?
I do remember them using the banks as a political weapon.
Sometimes that seems reasonable, like with a court order, to close up some KKK or Nazi bank account.
But other times seemed illegal or unreasonable, like I hate predatory check cashing places as much as the next guy, but those aren't illegal businesses. Just make the business illegal and I'm on board. As long as someone can get their day in court, due process, etc.

Well just like 1 BTC = 1 BTC,
If you have stock in a company and didn't sell, you still have stock in a company.
The concept of market cap is totally flawed, but here we are. I still have just as much stock as yesterday, and if the Feds fuck up and run the presses, I am hedged into stocks and bitcoin and I will be fine.
It's THEM that can't win at this point. If they run the presses they water down my debts like my fixed mortgage and leave me holding appreciating assets like stocks and cryptos. So its THEM that are losers here.
THEY should start making an honest system, and a return to normal is long overdue. There are a ton of pie in the sky shit companies surviving on cheap dollars, and as soon as they stop manipulating the system (they wont) then things could come down to Earth. But if they keep it up, there will be a meltdown. It's just how it goes.

I know what latency is. 
But what you do to overcome it is you have nodes that have (or should have) most of the transactions already in their RAM, and are getting new transactions all the time, slowly trickling in. 
(If you run low on RAM, throw away the ones that have low fees per byte or something).
Then when you hear about a new block, you can "assume" that most of the tranactions that you already have are already in your memory.
Then you can send out a Bloom filter off your ordered transactions list and ask whoever said "hey block found, here's the checksum (and header? something like that)" - your node can ask them - "hey I know these transactions - in summary - what am I missing?" and then get 1 or 2 last second transactions you didn't get, and confirm the block.
Way faster than suddenly having to transmit, all at once, a big block.
So you can move around - right now - 1 GB sized blocks, in the time it would take to send 10 to 50 mb blocks. That's still way bigger than the current situation etc.
People just have to think through things for a while, we'll come up with better ideas as we go.

Buying the coins to give to other people means supply leaves the market, and is not yet sold.
Then any coin gains value by having a community use it, Metcalfe's Law
And then speculators buy in anticipation of future price and value.

Central banks and finance companies are just going to be very wary about bitcoin because it's completely foreign to their mindset. They are very used to having relatively closed (but audited) books, they don't know what they don't know, the winners in the current game don't want a new thing to change the ground rules underneath them, and the current system gives them a lot of power.
Cryptocurrencies I think are here to stay, though they can be disrupted by legal means (make it illegal to own any), and technical means (the Great Firewall), and social means - changing the discourse about them to something else. 
Different question as to whether or not bitcoin alone, a replacement of bitcoin, or a family or constellation of altcoins, other cryptocurrencies based on other ideas, or a yucky closed group Ripple thing wins twenty years out... 
The invisible hand of the market is pretty likely to make the businesses a lot more efficient, and getting big profits off of remittances and simple money transfers, if it was ever profitable really, that's going to slip. The money they can make with true fractional reserve lending, and the power that gives them to reward friends (Cantillon effect) and spend money before the rest of the economy has seen it, they don't want to give up that power. They don't want their job to become an algorithm.
But, bitcoin or not, disruption is coming to finance. To some degree, they are ready. They hire a lot of smart people, "quants" etc, making money on lending, trading, risk management, etc. 
Can we change the culture where they take the risks and get the gains, but then when it implodes, they walk away and leave the taxpayer with the burden? Sometimes the "taxpayers" are also gaining - as some of them do well when they have a job, a working economy, some ownership of these public companies in their 401k etc. I have a lot of problems with them privatizing the gains and socializing the losses.
I think bitcoin has a good chance of becoming another odd currency in the great scheme of the currency crosses that are out there. Right now, whether they know it or not, if they take any currency at all, most people want mainly one of the major currencies for their goods and services, and would consider an alternate if they got a good rate of compensation for it (say 5%). So say I'd take dollars and bitcoin equally, but I'd have to be paid a little bit more in euros before (for me) it'd be a coin toss which one to take. But if you want to pay me in Iraqi Dinars - there's no question I'd rather be paid in bitcoins or dollars. I think that most people are slowly going to have the same realization -- that maybe if their currency servces less than on the order of ~10 million people, there's no point, and they might as well take dollars, bitcoins, or something else. I think that this has already happened. I think you could take dollars nearly anywhere and people would take it for payment - maybe it's not ideal, but they'd know it was valuable. And I think that will happen to cryptocurrencies and bitcoin specifically too. People will take bitcoins because it's a lot easier than getting set up with credit cards and PayPal and all kinds of junk.
The inflation rate of bitcoin is going to "improve" (there's no right number really), so it offers some incentive to join earlier rather than later, and it's very predictable...  It's going to be subject to speculative forces, like gold has been, but without having gold's history. It's astounding and kind of cool that 5000 years across cultures from Ancient Egypt to the modern day, gold has been very valuable. Bitcoin is the ultimate fiat currency - only worth something by fiat - but here the fiat is a group of people that all use it and not a sovereign demanding it as payment for taxes. Bitcoin is unreal, and very cool.

Chapter 1 - Scrap Yard Trezor
Scene opens with a man in thick motorcycle leathers, helmet,
and a sawed-off shotgun.
Enormous machines wade through piles of garbage with magnets.
The area is marked off with lasers on poles. 
My square area is somewhat large, maybe about 4 acres.
Pickers rove the smoking trash heap, and seagulls circle the
smoking garbage. 
Zoom in on the hand of a picker in their group lifting a scrap
of rusty sheet metal, throwing it over and finding some prize.
At a distance you can see the picker, she's taken off her hood
and is whooping with joy, the other pickers drop their stuff and
run over to see, and in a gaggle they leave together.
He goes over to ask one that stayed behind what happened.
"Found a Trezor in the junk. A one in a million find. But now you
have to get it open. Ah now that's teh trick.." And the semi-toothless
picker turned back to the trash.
The man in motorcycle leathers ambles back to the command shed at the
edge of the fields.
He clocks out electronically. Scanned with magnets. 
Strips out of those clothes, he heads into a decontamination shower, 
Enters a dark warehouse building. The square light at the door shows 
the inside. Small robotic lights move swiftly in the dark. With just
a little light and the whirring and rumbling comes to life.
The robots swiftly sort, pick, and image passing parts. Swift robot hands
and eyes work the conveyor belt, sorting and cateloguing objects at a
blistering speed.
A hard drive is found. The line stops, and it's lifted gingerly off
the line. Put into a mount. Cameras move around and image it in 3d.
Dented. Old. Mid 2015 SATA drive by Fujitsu. Serial number, place of
origin, good match for time and year. I go down, scan in the bucket.
The line resumes. I lift it up gingerly and give it a small shake, I
hear a rattle. Not good. Need to X-ray it. Put it into the SIEMENS
device, step around the glass to the console. Getting good pictures.
Six platters, one shattered. Dangerous to spin it up. I get the device
back and I pull the electronics. Good looking board, cracked. No problem.
Set that aside, might have something. The platters will have to be
magnetically checked in a clean room. But it can't move now, not with
loose parts inside. 
Chuck comes in, all swagger. He's quiet, serious. He'd normally have
some shit talk, so I look over at him. "Fuck off" he says. He's going
through cameras. I see him rewind the days events. He has a pad of 
paper on him. He's switching cameras, giving instructions to the device.
"Field view, left side, rewind, rewind, stop. Zoom in. Print it." He 
considers what he's seeing. "Outside view" I see their mopeds out on
the road, and a passing Security four-by-four on the road. "Zoom in.
Rewind to 4:20." More mopeds at the stand then. "Play." The crowd 
is coming out. The group is happy. The pickers go to their mopeds and
climb on. The camera is outlining the identified mopeds in rectangles.
"Zoom in, license on moped third from the left." Zooms in: YTK425 
"Print." Out comes a good picture of the plates. "Sweet." Pan out, the
mopeds are heading out of the fields.
Chuck leaves, gets into one of the armored work dozers and starts it. 
I remotely disable the engine, fold and lock the radio, and lock him 
inside and leave out the back of the command shed to my bike, an old
school gas burner. I have an hour tops before he can get out. 
In the distance is a perfect syzygy of the scrap fields, the diner,
the big city, the Citadel, and panning up into the dark sky, the Sky Castle.

So ... a Hyper Staking Prime Controller could in theory make a lot of coins, or a little, with the idea being that Cryptsy would have one so they could balance out market prices for Paycoins? eg produce less if they need to, or more, in order to flatline the USD price?
(But of course Hyper Staking is too tempting, so those with these secret Hyper Staking Prime Controllers mined more paycoins?)
Did Cryptsy abuse it? Sounds like a huge conflict of interest.

Bypass financial censorship. Permissionless participation. Digital scarcity. Programmable money. Rock-solid crypto security.

The price took a hit because the Mt Gox trustee dumped something like 15%. And the way the person sells is so over the top stupid that they can single-handedly tank the market. This leaves another 85% of the Mt Gox hoard (or so) overhanging the market - something like 93 days of supply. In anticipation of future stupidity, there are now cheap coins. Implied supply has gone up.

He's doing better I guess by going to a blockchain conference. But - quoting his Op Ed first:
^(&gt; Banknotes worked because people knew  something about the banks that issued them, and these banks had an  incentive to preserve their reputation. Governments have occasionally  abused the privilege of creating fiat money, but for the most part  governments and central banks exercise restraint, again because they  care about their reputations. But you’re supposed to be sure that a  Bitcoin is real without knowing who issued it, so you need the digital  equivalent of biting a gold coin to be sure it’s the real deal, and the  costs of producing something that satisfies that test have to be high  enough to discourage fraud.)
^(&gt; In other  words, cryptocurrency enthusiasts are effectively celebrating the use of  cutting-edge technology to set the monetary system back 300 years. Why  would you want to do that? What problem does it solve? I have yet to see  a clear answer to that question.")
The problem is that the centralized banks have every incentive to cheat.
Things have gotten bad enough, and could get worse, and IF there is more QE, negative interest rates, cash bans, bail-ins, and the like, THEN bitcoin is a hedge against those shenanigans (owning gold, stock, real estate, etc, might also work).
Also, people who want to spend on things without interference (right or wrong, legal or illegal, moral or immoral), then those people gain using a cryptocurrency to whatever extend the financial system squeezes them out. Anyone who wants financial freedom.
If the existing system was actually totally stopped from doing any QE, and could never print outside the existing schedule, and if they did not in any way limit what you could spend it on via bank wires or anything, and hypothetically could not stop you, and if you could be as private as you tried to be or wanted to be, then bitcoin (and a few other alts) would not need to exist.
But bitcoin and currencies that hold back from money printing, COULD do well if there's a financial crisis, or any kind of cash crackdown or financial squeeze on outsiders. Maybe.
That's what he doesn't get.  IT doesn't make as much sense to the usual Establishment. But that's because they benefit from the current system and are blind for the need to change.

Oh so, like raw native bitcoin on the phone - powered by an SPV client like Mycelium - that you don't see working, but a super stripped down SMS like system that says 'I approve sending funds XYZ from A to B (in bitcoin)' - you don't see that happening because in a sense that's not truly peer-to-peer bitcoin - that's an SMS up and over to a centralized service which could forward your bitcoins around properly, but then you don't have the keys yadda yadda.
I don't know, I think that most Westerners think places like Somalia are hopeless basket cases and super far behind, but in reality I think they have pretty good cell service and more modern cell phones than they are given credit for. And it's not all pirate havens and warlords there. Not saying it's safe for Westerners, but they seem to live okay and their economy is doing well. 
And other big markets like Nigeria, they're not doing that bad. They're an up and coming superpower if they run things right. So I don't think that the cell phone future is going to be delayed in any way.
I see things like M-Pesa slowed down by governments not wanting Safaricom to get too big and powerful. So they'll block and regulate it and pretty soon it'll get held down and held back. 
Something like bitcoin on phones can just slide on by...

Totally agree --
on bitcoin being a Ponzi, do you think it's an actual Ponzi, like Satoshi = Ponzi, or more like a 'natural Ponzi' as that one bank was thinking, where they think that each person that buys in has to shill to get it accepted by someone else, like a distributed-shilling-Ponzi-greater-fool currency?  (Or some other kind of Ponzi?)
I see bitcoin this other way, Ponzi or not, real or not, bitcoin like dogecoin has some value on markets -- like if someone pushed 2 million dogecoin at me, I might not think that currency is worth anything but it is worth something in bitcoins and dollars, and since I think those have a better future than doge, I would probably convert 95-100% of the doge over to bitcoins immediately and then think about if I want bitcoins or dollars more.

Is NeuCoin a spinoff of Jackson Palmer's - JP from Dogecoin? 
@_date: 2015-04-09 22:33:39
I'll break this answer up into pieces .....


Well, what happens is, if you buy bitcoin and hold it, at some point you realize that it's not like bitcoin is 'arable land' or a stock certificate which gives you ownership of something with a continuous income. (Maybe that's why Proof of Stake coins appeal to some people.)  So instead of realizing 'hey I have too much bitcoin, I need to have my assets be more productive' and sell a little or all, they instead double-down on the risk of having no bitcoins by gambling or investing in wild eyed Ponzis funded by bitcoin. It's better sometimes to just keep your cool and not get in deeper or over your head when it comes to owning bitcoin.
Ideally, you could be like the investors of bitcoin businesses which are hoping to fund operations and grow - not that they have it easy - but being able to invest in BitPay would be *safer* than the all-or-nothing bet on bitcoin (for example) and even BitPay struggles (I think I remember there were some layoffs and the football game is not a bitcoin game anymore).
I still think bitcoin is pretty cool but it's going to be a LONG hard road. It's not the easiest thing for people to understand and that slows adoption.... but it's still the biggest cryptocurrency out there, and I think that the 'network effect' is going to make it the leader for a long long time.
2) stealing bitcoin ... yes your security concerns are going to have to be at the max with bitcoin. In the conventional world of security, confidentiality failures (like having your email password stolen, having identity theft abused to take out loans or IRS refunds or some kind of scammy medical billing) can be dealt with by the long legal means and risk assessments that have safety netted the whole propped up mess. But with bitcoin, you are alone going to have to keep confidential things (bitcoin private addresses) completely secret. If your computer is compromised, and that's where you store bitcoins, you could be wiped out.
The FDIC insurance is currently paid for by everyone that pays taxes. It's not big enough to cover a total system failure. It's very effective. Capital requirements for banks make it mostly unnecessary. If a bank goes under by being over-leveraged it can be closed on a Friday and flipped to a new owner and open on Monday. The biggest banks, like Goldman Sachs, go basically insolvent and get bailed out by the regional Federal Reserve of New York as the people in government, Goldman Sachs, and the Federal Reserve work together to keep themselves solvent, which they can do because they control the whole financial system of dollars. Not a conspiracy, just reality. FDIC deposits are "safe" but it's all imaginary dollar numbers. But it's an illusion that enough people buy into that the currency stays afloat and a lot of people measure value denominated in it. So it's trustworthy-ish. :)
EDIT: tinfoil hat, obviously dollars are fine. If you have dollars though you must play by their rules - AML/KYC, and you buy into the system by having them and using them, for good or bad. Just like if you had Euros or Rubles.

If it's Tether related, from now on I'm downvoting it.
Anyone with a brain can see why Tether exists, how it can scam people, and what a run to the exits (into cryptos and out of Tether) looks like when, inevitably, there is a run for the exits.
Situation normal.
CRYPTO is real, and Tether is just a fucking IOU - so OBVIOUSLY get your head out of your ass, buy cryptos (especially bitcoin) and DONT keep a balance in Tethers or believe for a second that they are real.
They are just a way that shitty banks transfer their shittiness into the crypto space.
If banks would stop making it so fucking difficult to buy and to cash out, the ecosystem wouldn't need Tether.

Or more like this case, Team A goes through your case for evidence, and Team B gets to use some of Team A's and their own work to build an even better case. 
In this case, they tripped all over themselves, members of Team A went rogue, and the evidence laundering they were trying to pull -- pretty much worked. (It got Ulbricht convicted.)
It's almost parallel construction. I still want to know more about how Tor was uncovered - I don't think the server revealed it's real IP address. There was some other way they found those servers in Iceland. That's the parallel construction evidence I want to see. That initial evidence was probably not admissable because it's not conceivable that how the agent claimed to find the server is how they found the server.

You'd have to combine it with multisig so that you can get your coins out without them stopping you, and in the end, probably not the best way to run a bitcoin exchange.
Bitcoin takes reasonably 6 confirmations / 1 hour to settle for funding amounts and in the end, an exchange is going to be better off not trying to be a bitcoin wallet or bank.
I think that bitcoins in trading wallets are best thought of as IOUs.

Yeah you have countries with relatively sound money (Switzerland) but they're so much smaller than the US economy that they kind of got hurt by having such a strong currency. So they're not really big enough to be the reserve for the world. But you can find these banking points of light that do banking better than most. (For all that they were one of the big users of negative rates as a "solution").
If a country with sound resources could find a way to create special economic zones (Eg economic colonies) on the edges of existing countries, and apply their laws and finances to an area - like imagine if Switzerland was able to take an area of coastal Massachusetts near Boston, declare it a special economic zone with the US, have a joint Swiss/USA border area, Swiss taxes and banking laws in that area, declare the whole area maybe 100 sq miles as sovereign Switzerland - WELL - that would be a game changer. As it is, these sovereigns with better money than USA, they have no way or plan to make any use of a harder better money. They need things like the above in order to flex and have their rules apply in an area. Right now I think there's not a lot they can do if they have hard money.
Maybe make a sovereign wealth fund like Norway or Saudi Arabia did. But eventually that's going to get stolen by JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs, you just know it.  I think the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund has been tricked into buying bonds, so you know that will blow up and leave the fund empty at some point.

Well stock markets are usually safe from getting trashed by inflation but I get what you're saying. They're not safe if govts nationalize industries and make the stock worthless obviously.
And real estate is a big game of artificial fuck-you-I-got-mine NIMBY artificial scarcity. So it's a good investment, but making money off real estate scarcity is just typical humans being trash to each other. Making money providing homes and businesses with great functional stuff that meets their needs is fine. Getting rich by being landlord is lame.

This is the stage in the process where they flush money down the toilet trying to reinvent bitcoin by making their own strange altcoins that have no organic community.
They might be successful at making a strange altcoin of tech giants, but I think they are busy wrestling with how to make the reward external (remove the coinbase seignorage of mining)...
My best guess is that they will try something like PayCoin - start off Proof of Work, pre-mine 97% of it, switch to Proof of Stake. Then probably color the coins in some way so that they have some kind of kooky "master owner" - maybe 10 to 20 colors of coin - so that the coins are not completely fungible, but can be encumbered in different ways by the corporation/nation-state that they come from - and let each coin color make up it's own flow rules for validity with some kind of "color Oracles" that post public rules which can change every so many blocks - like maybe every two weeks or so at the retarget...
See, overall, I imagine that they are struggling to make something use a blockchain but be similar enough to existing systems of control that they hope it would be accepted and succeed. 
I think "Internet of Things" is going to be a different game and problems like patching firmware on refrigerators, I don't see that getting fixed with blockchains.

Like if you have a Trezor, that you assume has good firmware and wasn't tampered with on it's way to you or during manufacture...
And you have the Trezor linked up to a secure-ish PC with a non-Trojan USB cable..
But you say, leave it with someone else to move funds around and they record the emanations when working with it while it signs things...
Then the recordings of those emanations were a weak spot that revealed that it had some timing and power levels that gave away the key. Fixed in a later firmware I guess.

Wild April Fool's joke but actually - a state-owned hardware bitcoin wallet, from which you have the only valid wallet to send and receive money and be taxed, is pretty much the exact Orwellian nightmare form that bitcoin could take. They could make it a 2 of 3 multisig and they have two keys and you have one key. You have to get cosigned to spend (they only allow spends to other wallets and other registered and taxed businesses), and they can yank all of the funds whenever they want. I can almost imagine it.

Dang one of the problems with these things is that although arbitrage is possible, there's no honest advantage to share the profits with anyone. If you could arbitrage it, you would leverage it, then keep all the profits yourself.
So the odds are &gt; 80% likely that Atlas whatever is a scam and it took any kind of clampdown to find it out. That's really unfortunate.
One of the common problems people have with bitcoin is once they have some, it just sits there. Then they cast around trying to increase it, by trading, gambling, altcoin speculation, lending schemes (scams like BitConnect), or pyramids like this investing thing, etc.
You should just sell your bitcoin if you can't get it into either personal use to buy something, or buy bitcoin and hold the keys offline safely.
I'm sorry you got burned by this, it does not look good.
Kind of not a bitcoin specific thing. People take their 401ks, invest in scammy REITs in the third world and then try to live in their foreign condo, and when all of the above is illegal, they have no one to turn to - not the IRS who would bust them, nor the foreign govt that hates outsiders anyway.
So the problem of being scammed is not a specifically bitcoin thing but it makes the takebacks you would try harder to effect, so scammers are drawn to it. It's the flipside of a dollar system full of scammers too. (Unless you are best friends with the govt / banking system?) Most people fail to benefit from the fiat system. I've had about 25% of my purchasing power stolen in 10 years by the USA govt for example.

About an afternoon, if you had a Pentium.
Who knows what he means by scrambled?
If he means the key is right there, but that two individual characters are out of place, and you just have to move them around...
The D at the beginning looks right.
It looks about 60 characters long, so you have to take each one of those characters (60 of them), move it along each position (60 of them), then grab another character (60, 59, whatever, of them) and try them in other positions in front or behind your chosen character and all those positions (60, 58 whatever).
It's not really that many combinations, so its turned out he has his own definition of the word "scrambled", right?

network effect and network are different things
bitcoin without the network effect is not better technologically than litecoin. The only reason to stay on bitcoin is because so many other people are (That's it's network effect value)
And bitcoin without a network between people would be a slow sneakernet, it could have maybe 1 block a day month or year if we had to pass a block around on flash drives (how long would it take to move those around) - it certainly has more utility (and value) by being nearly real-time networked. Effectively with 10 minute blocks and about 6 confirmations to be secure, you really have about 1 hour settlement on things that takes a month on VISA - instant for purchases but actually rollbacks possible for a long time. VISA can get thousands of transactions per second - but those are transactions, not settlements. Bitcoin has low transaction speed, but a matching super-high speed settlement.
And so why does TPS matter - an entirely offline bitcoin "network" as you say - a copy of it's blockchain, as like a historical record, it does have value sure I guess (proof of work) and could have some information saved to it (like hashes of key documents, tamperproof timestamp notary kind of function) - I get that's worth something. In fact, a tamperproof timestamped notary is so valuable, you can make a money out of it (tah-dah)
I don't mean to talk past you, I get that you're an enthusiast, me too.

Well transactions volume, and maybe the value being transacted, and some sense of the value of the friction being transacted against -- those matter.
Example - you have to take into account the value of what's being transacted, or else it matters that dogecoin is at 1/2 the transaction numbers.
And you have to take into account the friction against transactions (the fees) because otherwise, fee-less transactions are just moving money from left pocket to right pocket, like they are on Chinese exchanges. (Bitcoin has fees for transactions usually so I think these numbers are 'real')
But you can't just look at transaction volume alone.

MMT is almost beyond that. It almost reaches the point of "self-aware wolves", except I would call it "self-aware sheep". Self-aware sheep suddenly wake up one day and realize money is made up.
Then they realize, "wait why have taxes, we can just print money and give it to who we want" (like the rich do, but they do it through more convoluted means so there isn't a fucking revolution and mass guillotine). Game set and match.
Classic self-aware sheep right now - and I love them for it - Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and AOC. These are the kind of people that love MMT.
Take Senator AOC - who I love because she shakes shit up and calls people on their bullshit, even if I'm not as liberal as she is, I admire her haha - for now, maybe someday she will do something super crazy but it's been fun.
I don't hate on people who like MMT, I just get the popcorn and watch and see what happens next. Because NEXT, they implement their ideas (Which are noble and just and fun and fair and I approve) and then the rich have a conniption and sic their private armies on everyone (Blackwater / Xe) and society falls apart.
I mean that's not going to happen, and I don't want society to fall apart, but conflicts over what kind of society do we want and how the fuck do we get the rich to pay their fair share, and what should society do for the least of its members, those are important and good fights. Coming right out with MMT to solve these problems, is a bit of an economically ass-backwards way of having that fight, so I approve. (I still believe really in Austrian economics, so I think all the chicanery is fun to watch)
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:44:21
Yeah good analogy. If the group that prints tickets does it slowly and leaks a little to their friends first, the prices take time to respond. (Cantillon Effect). If you release the free tickets all at once then yes it falls apart. But good riddance to bad rubbish :) (the monetary system).
Watching Keynesians argue with MMT's is like watching the school rich kid snob fight with the school frat boy. It's like oh damn, throw down, get the popcorn. They're both dumb morons, they're both getting expelled, they're both going to get their asses kicked, they are going to kick each other's asses, this is great.

That's really interesting -- there was something about Chain ID's and Merkle trees talked about below --

What is it that miners are putting into those 200 bytes and ... how do you get a mining group like Eligius to mine a header you want (can you pay a fee to a pool for this? something where once a day, for some price, you could get this merge-mining done?)

I think it's hard for most people to understand how vast the productivity gains have been from mechanization and computers, so the reality may take a long time to land(!!)
In that, as much as I hate Keynes we really may be now living in that goofy dream state where our economy levitates forever in imaginary money. Only possible because of the mechanization and computers providing such vast productivty for so little effort that no amount of "reality" can be imposed on this economy now. Who know anymore. It is that upside down.
Off-topic Futurism:
If we take the next step, into space, with AI, unlimited space resources (Asteroids with water, minerals etc), and massive genetic bio-engineering, mind-hacking with neural lace, we could live in completely illusionary dream worlds with the damn near unlimited energy of the sun powering vast expansion of life and human civilization out to the belt of rocks between Earth and Mars and ... what even is an "economy" at that point.

I think that what could happen is that bitcoiners would be wealthy in fiat terms (numbers in a bank account) - but probably prevented from becoming politically wealthy - eg able to actually use the money and not get randomly ransacked. We have to come up with an idea like the rich did, with corporations and family funds and things like that in order to be wealthy.
But we could also use a much more sustainable and fair model where the rich can't have any position over anyone, nor something they can just hand over to their own relatives
Eg, being rich would mean merely being a consumer. Just because you are rich you wouldnt get to direct anyone's lives. No one would direct anyone's lives. We all just do smaller scale things for each other, that's all.

Since you say "If a currency officially aligns with a political field it has already failed."
And I think what you mean is that if a currency has a politics to it, and if it's designed by them or for them, then it serves believers and supporters of that politics really well - whether they benefit from it, or are abused by it, whatever - if currencies line up with politics then there are winners and losers.
In some sense, a "politicized" currency loses out by not being a "Big Tent" - like politics - a currency that only appeals to small numbers of people is of limited value...
Ah okay, well problem - bitcoin has some characteristics - which make certain political groups dislike it.
(and other vocal political groups like it).
But bitcoin is kind of just a protocol like HTTP or a social construction like a Wiki, (EDIT: added - or like BitTorrent). It serves some people well, and others it does not. But it's not a conscious living thing or anything. So it just is, and doesn't care what it's users politics are.
You could argue that Libertarian politics seem toxic because they are easy to lampoon as selfish Ayn Rand-droids, whose fate is a lawless war-torn apocalyptic hellhole like Somalia (Which Somalia is not, but whatever), 
Or Statists might as "but but who will build the roads???" and what about Basic Income and Progressive taxation? What about money laundering (financial thoughtcrime) etc???
Bitcoin .... just has nothing to say about that. It's a technology.

Little hardware wallets on a chip and an API to work with them could be interesting.
You could have vending machines which pay for their own refills from a service company for example, and maybe could receive bitcoin to do it again (or close the loop and be paid in bitcoin) etc.
You might even logically separate the design a little bit so that when you put in change (nickels, dimes, quarters) you get paid in bitcoin from a mini-ATM machine, but it turns around and sends bitcoin to another distinct part of the machine which takes only bitcoin and dispenses products.

@_date: 2019-09-12 16:51:52
counter-idea? You don't hear about it much but check out Georgism (a tax on real estate only).
My version of it would have it so that if someone else was willing to pay a multiple of your real estate taxes, then they get to own the property (and pay you full value) 
You pick the value you want to assess it at and pay taxes on. (Might as well be market value, or else someone will buy it from you). 
Special exceptions for a very small plot of land around your home (say, 1/10th of an acre) where you pay maybe a small fixed rate from the time you bought it. 
Then when big corporations buy and make a fancy headquarters, it's automatically for sale as an asset. They should pay market rates on the taxes or else their competitors could just buy it away from them (quite disruptive). It allows corporations to buy properties and put in malls, if they can afford it.
It encourages everyone to own way less land. Let more of it go back to Nature.
And it unfetters all the global trade we know is possible, but these f-ing taxes are obscene.

Just my opinion but he was just trying to find a cryptographic hash function that you could believe in, and SHA-2 / SHA 256 fit the bill. 
Now that there are ASICs for SHA256 hashing, it wouldn't be a bad thing to adjust the POW to require good quantities of RAM, like gigabytes, to hash.
I don't really mind GPU mining because it's harder to make a botnet farm of stolen computers with GPU mining. With CPU/RAM, you could botnet office machines. But with GPUs, you're going to notice a hot slow computer and not all computers, probably less than 5% of them out there, would make a nice computer for GPU mining, and you'd definitely notice the fps hit when playing games, so GPU mining seems to require an honest mining setup.

Oh right yes like predictable schedule and other things that make it useful for that. Sure, okay, I see your point. A bitcoin is still a bitcoin in a million years, but it does seem to depend on a system of people keeping it going. I think store of value to some people just means "gold" and that ability to bury it and come back and it's still gold. We know that means you can still lose it, have it fall into a crack in the earth and be lost, etc. You can lose gold as easily as you can lose bitcoin on a dead hard drive.

Well that's not completely true ... other things are getting faster, larger, cheaper, and better: networks, hard drives, RAM, CPUs ... and so on, so it's kind of FUD to over worry about block size.
My friend is off to go buy a $100 4 Terabyte USB 3 external drive for his X-box. I mean, I thought a terabyte cost $100, but no, It's 1/4 the price I thought it was.

There's a thread on this over on too, basically some guy was shilling a 5 algorithm crypto as the fix. Buttcoin kind of latched onto this idea that China could shut down bitcoin anytime by taking over 51% of mining hashpower and crowing haha this would be the end for sure.
But basically the concept was a withholding attack; China somehow seizes all miners, makes it so that the confirmation time goes through the roof outside China (aka makes it possible for outsiders to make miners be profitable)
But... somehow Blockstream satellite beaming bitcoin blocks (and transactions or just blocks?) into China doesn't matter, because reasons.
Then suddenly Chinese miners ignore all those outside blocks, and play only their own transactions and the pile of work and blocks is allowed back out of China, undoing say 2 weeks of outside world transactions.
But ... somehow we'd all just sit on our hands and let that happen? I think they call it the difficulty death spiral.
More than likely we would either patch like bch did and have a weird-ass difficulty adjustment, or add proof of stake, or add a patch to have permissioned pools and miners, or we'd have a node blocklist get passed around, or add a companion algorithm to bitcoin so it's SHA256+some basic CPU/GPU algo, or things like that.
What we WOULDN'T do is sit here and lose our cool bitcoin. Bitcoin to survive probably couldn't be a pure SHA256 coin, but you never know.
Maybe someone would sneak into China and listen with a really amped up shortwave radio jury-rigged to Taiwan or Japan, or a microwave beam and point it right out over to Japan, and some other guy on that end would have a super sensitive listener, and lo and behold the super low bandwidth blockchain would be two-way, and China's stupid plan would fail.
The point is, bitcoin and it's mining is not really the weak point here.
It's really like asking which is stronger: China, an authoritarian hell-state that executes people over ~~nothing~~ anything they don't like especially political opponents, or bitcoin which is distributed and has no real leader but has a big global community of users and supporters (and detractors sure) which will just adjust - as long as China doesn't control the hearts and minds of the bitcoin community at large (and they don't) then bitcoin will win. Whatever bitcoin becomes, it becomes whatever the community supports.
The short answer is that "consensus" is what defeats China here.
EDIT: by the way, not to understate this, there is a MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE UTTERLY MASSIVE waste - malinvestment - in China into underused hydropower plants, and that is what makes mining there profitable. If China stopped wasting money building hydrodams with spare gigawatts of power  (!!???!!!) then they would not need to recoup or embezzle or whatever you think is happening, the sheer amount of wasted money/energy/effort. So from that front, centralized Chinese govt might hate bitcoin, but the provinces where the dams are really need the money from these hydro dams to pay off in SOMETHING, they wish it was aluminum smelting and jobs, but they'd take bitcoin mining money if that's all they can get....
So what this means is, it's obvious why people mine there, it's because power is so cheap. Same with the country of Georgia, Iceland, the Pacific Northwest etc.
So yeah maybe they've hit on something hilarious in this critique of bitcoin - bitcoin assumes economically rational participants, maybe some politically motivated attackers. And they envisioned attackers that might make competing equipment or steal/co-opt equipment. But the thought of a massive State actor who irrationally produces 5x the electricity they need commercially to the point where it's almost too cheap to meter, that is not really something bitcoin envisioned. That is, a State this colossally stupid and corrupt, I don't think Satoshi quite imagined. Nor could do I think how malign a State could be - maybe - they didn't take that into account either. Just a big somewhat ordinary opponent I think was envisioned. (Like maybe "Colorado" or "Oregon" etc). Not something big enough to truly throw down against bitcoin. My personal view here is that bitcoin was like a cool experiment by them. Maybe it would work, maybe it would scale, etc. These are massive and interesting problems it now has to face.

Bitcoin is disinflationary. 
It inflates, but that rate of inflation is scheduled to go down over time.
Otherwise it would all be a big premine and there'd be difficulties distributing it.
Would be interesting if an airdrop like Auroracoin over Iceland had worked better - there the model was if you were an Icelandic citizen you got some Auroracoins but it didn't seem to do well.
Anyway, distributing coins is a whole 'nother story. But bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency is just going to be distributed / mined in this way.

That's a really interesting question.
Some of the landmarks in your question have some intriguing answers that maybe can fit together like puzzle pieces..
1) trapdoor functions in mathematics are going to make brute forcing bitcoin keys really hard (impossible) and people would have to work around that to steal your private keys
2) you can spread out your keys with multisig, to give you enough redundancy that short of meteor-strike / nuclear / global cataclysm, you have your keys and bitcoins.
3) you are still you, it's not like you're going to be uploaded into the Matrix, so people can - even if they can't take your bitcoins - they can put you in a concrete cell and deny you the ability to use them in a meaningful way.. (and they can do worse to you, and/or beat your bitcoins out of you -- but they can also steal your land, property, hurt you in other ways etc, so it's not like bitcoins solves that problem ...) 
4) but it does make it hard for them to subject you to contracts you don't like and without your permission seize your value. In some sense, you have to buy in.
5) the hardware and software to simply view balances (eg what address should you send coins to?) is going to come under more attack probably, eventually...
6) because the hardware that signs transactions is going to get pretty secure...

It's sustainable-ish. I think that some people stay out because they see no path to riches in bitcoin - so they roll out altcoins, some with good features - because they missed the boat on bitcoin.
I'm kind of taking a different path, and going with the assumption that although it's irrational - that bitcoin was the early first and except for alts with incredible features - the public will slowly slowly slowly take on bitcoin. 
The fact that, to the public, bitcoin is equivalent to a "premine" is probably a turn off. Now that cryptocurrency is "a thing", a lot of them are going to try altcoins until those flash in the pan. One or more might get really lucky and build a following, but some of the things that make a coin popular (community) are also some of the things that people abuse (Dogecoin/moopal whatever, PayCoin/GAW whatever).
So I see altcoins and altcoin communities as kind of a dead end compared to the simpler no get-rich-quick reality of bitcoin.

Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies do what you're thinking of regarding pollution or energy use or whatever.
The problem is that Proof of Stake is kind of twisty to evaluate whether or not it stays secure. Either nothing really at stake, or very interesting tricks to make it work (Etherium's future) ... 
bitcoin's brute force Proof of Work is kind of extreme, but bluntly simple to understand, and as far as I can tell impossible to counterfeit. Maybe subvert or trick is still possible, but genuine bitcoin is really something you can't seem to wiggle out via a trick. You're left with trying to make more efficient SHA256 chips and algorithms ...

For a major retailer like Amazon, and from the operations side, and funds side, and all that, bitcoin is a no-brainer. There's plenty of time to settle the account (6 confirmations is trivial), to ship to far away places, etc. 
It's not even hard to code. 
BUT - they just haven't done it yet because (and this is maybe hard in the echo chamber here) -- because bitcoin is very politicized. It doesn't matter if it's "better" to Amazon, because they don't care.
What's political about bitcoin? Encoded in its DNA are goldbug like ideas about currency. And libertarian ideas about freedom from State control. And cypherpunk ideas about peer to peer money, p2p file transfer like BitTorrent, and encrypted distributed communication and email systems like PGP/GPG - 
So big groups which benefit from the status quo, and which are hugely profitable as-is, like Amazon, are going to wank about "drone delivery" when bitcoin is sitting right there, able to make them .... maybe 1% more profitable if everyone switched to it. (They get a discount on credit card processing for sure, even though there's probably piles of attempted or successful credit card fraud flowing through them. Amazon gets a free pass and a ton of freebies from all kinds of vendors, so the vendors get the bragging rights that Amazon is a customer of theirs.)
EDIT: anyway, my point is -- Amazon knows their costs. Amazon KNOWS they are getting shafted with credit card chargebacks. The problem is not "How do we deliver to remote Wyoming? How should we deliver to backyards in LA --  I know! Drone delivery!"  The problem is "Goddamn that's a lot of charge backs and fraud, how the hell should we stop this??" And bitcoin .... is right ... f-ing there. And it's clearly the solution to the problem. And they don't care. It's just politics that keeps it out, not technology.

Bitcoin is a system where no one needs any particular permission to be a developer. 
1) You could come up with cool ideas if you like,
2) or try to specify exactly how bitcoin "should" work (in your own mind where you have a model of bitcoin) and then check and see how it actually does work and if there are any edge or problem cases
3) if you think if new cool things you could do with bitcoin, you can explore those as soft forks, hard forks, or altcoins, etc.

The 1 to 1 channel is easy to understand and set up - but the use cases are something like a gift card, coffee shop card etc, with some bitcoin escrowed away into the channel. It could be two way, if the person buying coffee to drink is also selling the other end the coffee beans, but it's kind of contrived...
The next one where it's one buyer up to a big seller like Amazon, down to another buyer, where those legs are doing buys and sells up to and through a big middleman, that has some potential, but you'd have to see if you could make that scale.
The ideal is some kind of mesh of transactions floating around between people, essentially all as time locked crypto IOUs between them and when someone wants to close the circuit, play a small message to the blockchain which settles up all the accounts they're entangled in. And you have to accomplish this with no hand-waving, no Moon Maths, and no bugs.
I personally think that some trick of publicly escrowing some bitcoin, and some other side channel of 'liens' against that escrowed bitcoin, with these kinds of countdown clocks before all must settle up - that's the insight that I think Lightning Network got right. 
I also have a vested interest in hoping Lightning Network is right, because if they are, then payment channels are created by people who actually have some bitcoin, and while it's locked up in these transactions, it's committed to use - and makes less bitcoin available to others - drives scarcity - makes bitcoin more expensive to purchase - but just as useful to use - and ideally means that someday, the bigger your company is in purchasing power, the more bitcoin you need to buy. Much like companies require employees, office space, electricity and so on. Maybe someday a company like BMW will need to escrow out about 50 bitcoins to run their purchasing department. There may also be efficient ways a little company could only use 1 or 2 bitcoins, but it'd be so complex a big company wouldn't bother.

You mean, how much to pay developers to code a site like it, but which you could unpack into another country, like ... Indonesia or Morocco etc?
A site like that might only be $20-$100k to build a quick version. To build a secure version could cost a small fortune, and more than that I think you would have a lot of reading to do because you have to go do some due diligence in the design to handle and protect not only against obvious things, like anything you could manage with ISO 27001 or NIST 800-53 controls, but you also have to go read all of the bitcointalk.org scam and hack history, and get tons of advice probably from  join their Web of Trust and read years of IRC logs to get caught up... 
It's a huge responsibility being a bitcoin business and it's so easy to trip up and get it wrong...
All that might be less than the costs of getting money services licenses in whatever country. Paying the toll to the bureaucracy ;) but also having your legal, compliance, insurance (if that's even possible) and other bases covered.
It could be lucrative as heck though for an underserved market - take India - but really uphill if you're not from the local culture and know what it needs.

Tell me if I am understanding you - is this the scenario you are describing? I am being genuine in trying.
Oh okay, so the line of thought goes - say I have a lot of mining pools, and I'll cut it into like 5 pieces for simplicity - 
* U - in USA
* C1 - in China
* C2 - in China, right next to C1 (nothing against China, just an example)
* G - Germany
* R - Russia
And say that each piece had 20% of the hashrate.
You're saying that because C1 and C2 are right next to each other, that they can transfer and build on each others blocks way way faster than U, G, and R can see or respond and do anything about it?
That'd be an inadvertent latency-driven block withholding attack, yes?
Yeah I know. I forget though what percent of the hashrate you need, theoretically, to pull this off. Wasn't it still 51%
Or is it some other terrible number like 40%, I literally don't know.
Someone's done the math on block withholding attacks - let me check.

The interest rate game probably ends in more and more move to gold and other commodities for inter-country levels of settlement. Each country devalues its currency more and more. Eventually the dollar loses world reserve currency status.
The countries economically hover and appear productive but are actually trash economies. Some small indendent city states or tiny countries which run their economies better at the small scale become super powerful and influential. Not necessarily these countries, but similar conceptually: Monaco, Luxembourg, Singapore, Brunei, Kuwait, Malta, ... and odd countries you might not expect, like maybe Lebanon or Iceland or something. The thing they struggle with is that they can't fix the whole world, and the rest of the world won't be able to imitate them. So they will have a model of wealth that everyone else can't copy. (Remember how you had what was it - Abu Dhabi??? - flexxing during the war on Libya??? sending arms to rebels?? wtf, that little country??)
And the central banks will just keep stocks on the balance sheet like an index fund. And that'll be "fair" (but really making a zombie of the economy) and there'll be little scandals (trillion dollar scandals) where some companies are being bought and propped up in goofy ways to keep "jobs" or "tax base" or "stability" (prevent revolution and riots, keep mortgage payments coming in). Example - GM - and car makers world wide have VAST OVERCAPACITY - and there is MASSIVE AUTOMATION that should result in plant closures and job losses, but society can't react fast enough to this disruption in people (voters) lives and what's happening with computing, AI, and automation is fucking up society as we know it - normal Joes and Janes are losing their blue collar jobs - soon it will be white collar types losing their jobs. But there is basically nothing we can do, because if you know technology, then you know how fucking obvious it is that you can automate production with robots, and code people out of jobs, its really easy. A fucking spreadsheet / Excel macro could do a lot of white collar "jobs" you just need someone who has the political power to accomplish anything in most places that's all that's really needed, not tech skills per se. But I don't mean fascist political power, I mean just at normal workplaces what's lacking is good management, not a lack of technology.)
The only white collar work that will do great will be Silicon Valley techbros, government workers, and FIRE (finance, insurance real estate), but law will do well. Venture Capital will be funding amazing things, while other VCs kill off companies (think Mitt Romney)
Everyone else outside cities is going to be hat in hand watching their purchasing power destroyed, homeless, high on meth, toothless.

Well, the bottom line is the spreadsheet calculates out:
"Current USD value of break even TX size to where bribe makes sense to undo X confirmations	50.454" and you say that's USD -- but you got the units maybe different than I think .
I think it's actually line 11, where you say in B11 that it's 212.5 bitcoins to bribe 25% of the hashrate to go back 1 block.
Then on line 12, keeping this in perspective -- 1/4 - 25% of all hashpower is going to expect to earn 1/4 of the bitcoins -- 12.5 bitcoins. So it's reasonable to expect that they are going to need a HUGE bribe - so your 212.5 bitcoins calculation looks correct -- and that's to go back only  _ _ _ ONE _ _ _ block.  That's 212.5 bitcoins * cost in dollars per bitcoin =
So line 12 should be about 50,000 dollars --
Now the cool thing with your spreadsheet -- you could do other columns, one column for each value - how far back in time (how many confirmations) do you want.
For others in the US - the spreadsheet is using European commas and decimals. So the "50.454" figure means $50454 dollars to bribe 1/4 the hashrate to undo 1 confirmation.
Where things get interesting is the cost to undo 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 confirmations:
And there seems to be something not quite right about the formula --- because it's getting less expensive to bribe for higher confirmations.
Somethings wrong with the B7 formula .... 
You can see the problem if you make a separate column for higher and higher confirmation numbers and compare them.
EDIT: one thing that's weird about the spreadsheet is the "bribing concept" itself -- intuititively, it gets more and more unlikely that they would actually succeed at undoing a deeply confirmed transaction, but it's 100% likely that this kind of deep-confirmation bribery market undercuts what bitcoin is trying to do. And it might make people seek other altcoins and other solutions that drive people away from bitcoin. So because it hurts the market, it comes across as very desperate for miners to try this. Still good I guess to look into worst case / Prisoner's Dilemma scenarios though. Bitcoin is probably robust against this, and it's cool to see some numbers come out.

Ugh. Wish there was a good way we could de-fang these ransomware systems.
Prevent, detect, and recover -- 
Definitely there's a problem with people downloading things from email and running it - phishing attacks.
There's also a problem with people running software that purports to be cracked or stolen or dodgy utilities. 
Then of course, these problems are running in the context of the users themselves - users have on line access to all of their most sensitive and valuable information, whether that's personal photos, documents, whatever, or work information, all worth a lot more to them than this ransom. So we need some way for it to be ubiquitous that people can both store a lot more information, AND be able to roll back to a time - the backup and recovery problem.
My guess is that greater than 90% of the population is vulnerable to this risk by the way they use computers.

That's their choice dude.
There's no such thing as a spam transaction. If it's a valid transaction, fits in a block, whatever, it's valid. It's not spam. It's their coin anyway. (hate to say "altcoin" but some might argue it's a bitcoin altcoin)
If you make the blocks small and the fees high, then people have to use the space much more efficiently. Long run, the probably can't store actual transactions in the system anymore, but only settlement transactions or meta transactions - like a digital signature that something else happened, or was registered and existed, at least as late as (and possibly earlier than) the date and time of the block.
Big blocks make it easier to use bitcoin in old fashioned ways, like I heard that SatoshiDice got going again, but had to use Bitcoincash to do it. It would be easier to go there - larger blocks and probably the same old code (to them).

That first arrest of Micon was definitely a warning shot. After that, he probably couldn't leave the country right?
I couldn't believe he was inside the United States, it's a very bipolar country when it comes to a lot of things -  online gambling is just one.
I'm totally 100% in favor of online gambling. Gambling addiction is a separate issue, but if people have a devil-may-care attitude about the future or a desperation for financial deliverance and seek it from gambling, and are ruining their families lives to do it - then they have an addiction and should seek help.
But for grown ups that want some thrilling entertainment, seems great.
If law enforcement has problems with organized crime using gambling to cover the proceeds of whatever it is they've done that's a crime (probably something like selling cannabis, or some other crime that wouldn't be a crime except they've defined it as one and created a criminal industry by outlawing it instead of licensing things)

Eh, just different meanings of the word 'lost'. 
The bitcoins are all (mostly) accounted for. These inputs went to those outputs and it should all total up. So they're being clever by saying the bitcoins aren't really lost, they're there in the blockchain.
But, obviously some coins are sent to addresses which act like the 1BitcoinEater address so those coins are lost forever. Some is spent as dust which might cost too much to move. 
But what normal people mean by lost bitcoin are lost bitcoin private addresses, which are needed to sign transactions that authorize moving the funds around.
And definitely people have lost hard drives, corrupted wallets, hand-crafted transactions that went badly, etc. So there's a lot of bitcoins lost. I'm kind of a "heretic" (if is a cult) because I think Satoshi lost many of their private keys and that's why they've stayed anonymous and retreated.
I could be wrong, Satoshi could sign one of those old addresses someday. Be the easiest way to prove he owns the private address still. Seems strange he would say "I am not Dorian" on some crypto site.

You can look over the order books at  for a few major exchanges, like Bitstamp, BTC-e, etc and see how much bitcoin is for sale.
You could get thousands of bitcoins out before anyone noticed, probably $20 mil worth or more.
The key to avoiding slippage is to do something you can't do in normal markets - paint the tape. 
How you do this is you buy up to a resistance point, eat a lot of that nice wall while you can, and then before you destroy the wall, and learn to time the intervals for the 1 min, 5 min, 15 min candles, paint the tape back down moderately with a tiny sell.
The volume numbers will be legit, but looking back over the day, the painted tape will make trading activity look ho-hum at the scale of a day.

Sure, realistically, a computer does super high speed processing, and it's not like we can physically see the actions of electrons or do a lot of the math in bitcoin with pen and paper or in our minds.
1) Simple things like dice can be used to generate a bitcoin address...
2) I'm not sure how difficult it is to craft your own bitcoin transaction on paper -- maybe hard, but I'm not sure.
3) playing a bitcoin message, securely, to a node, I am not sure of all the attack vectors I know of...
4) the weak point would remain - the channel that someone uses to tell you to send to address X - I think there'll always be man in the middle channels trying to trick you into sending to address Y
Because even if you rolled your own addresses (with dice) and could craft and send your own transactions (written on paper), I'm not sure how anyone is going to communicate addresses to you over the Internet without a Trojan horse computer system or software somewhere out there :)
Good luck with this Internet thing, nah, it'll never work ;) /s

With something like the lightning network you can make it not matter. If you and I in advance escrow out some bitcoin channels between us (given, pure 1 to 1 would not be that common), what lightning networking would do is let us set up some exchanges where you and I can go back and forth swapping signed messages at realtime (0 waiting) where if we *want to* we can play those to the bitcoin network, but we're kind of more incentivized to hold that in our pocket instead and not play it out to the network until some good amount of time is up, and we might go back and forth each day or whatever.

But past Namecoin and DNS, the end of registrars ...
A way to make a self-signed cert and put the hash of that up into something like the Namecoin blockchain as a message on your DNS, to tie those together..
And then some way to make your web pages have content, with tags, and the fact that you have certain content by keywords, you could make that searchable..
How pages link to each other.. maybe you could look for micropayments between addresses on a blockchain to tell how popular something is, in order to know that search terms on the destination address are important. Maybe those would be registered stealth addresses...

If you find yourself wanting to buy cloud miners with bitcoin, then instead of doing that just cash out a little bitcoin and buy yourself something nice or buy something with bitcoin directly.
Getting scammed starts when you have some bitcoin but you decide you want much more and will risk a lot to get it.

FIRST - I am a million percent against the stupid BitLicense.
Next -
They may or may not.
I didn't find an online list of Money Services Businesses (like check cashing companies)
nor did I find an online list at the NY Department of Financial Services (DFS) about which corporations do or don't have a BitLicense.
I don't know if this means, but it probably implies, that you have the adminisitrative (legal?) right (privilege?) as a New York consumer, to ask the company to know if they're licensed.
Along with the "right" to be served by companies with BitLicenses, you get treated like a sheep and you don't need these fucking useless middlemen regulators. 
The BitLicense was a scam to get Lawsky a job in industry later as a Compliance Officer. It's part of the government-industry swamp. Businesses that suck up and get the license use the regulation to keep competitors out of their industry. Not to help the fucking consumer.

If it was a US bank, yes they would be able to create the money out of thin air. Correspondence banking, yadda yadda. If he got a cashier's check from bank A and deposited it at a different bank B, then to settle the account, the original bank, bank A, would take a loan at extremely generous rates from the Fed so that they don't blow out their 10% or whatever reserves.
If they want to they can then package up and sell that loan on to other people to carry, or if it looks profitable and the kind of loan they'd like to keep, strategically, they can keep it.
US banks, literally, can create money out of thin air. Just qualify for a loan. The rates are low, and the rates that banks borrow from the Fed are also low.

Anything could be done with a hard fork but what you're proposing is not a good idea.
Coins being stuck where they are is fine. What would happen is a slippery slope where the code to take immobile bitcoins and re-mine them would become code for people to seize the coin stashes of groups they don't like. If you do that, no one is going to keep bitcoins with value. They have value because people can't take them away from you (without a hard fork). Threatening to hard fork it and do this and actually coming close to doing it would result in a hard hit in value of bitcoin and a huge growth in a competitor that didn't play by those rules. So, no point.

I don't know if this is the same thing, but this one is ring signatures for bitcoin.
They give credit to bytecoin for the idea so they call them bytecoin ring signatures, but the idea is to bring it to bitcoin (I guess via a sidechain.) I see the paper as a form of understanding.
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:08:41
Two (or more) ends escrow up some bitcoin. They use a countdown system to trade values and half sign the transactions. They effectively make a circuit. At any time either party can close the circuit by signing and sending out to the bitcoin network a recent unexpired transaction to the network...
The simplest set up is kind of ideal for things like a Starbuck's gift card. 
It's so much better than my short description I can't even.
But lightning network + maybe one more great invention like it, and I think we have the fast super scalable bitcoin we always dreamed of.

What can the average person do? Sell goods and services for bitcoin, buy and hold and use for purchases ....
A person with more of a computer science, maths, game theory, networking, cryptography, they might put some thoughts towards what kinds of changes are needed to the kinds of transactions people are making - like the Lightning Network which seems to have figured out (but needs a soft fork and some game theory to test it) a one-to-one and maybe a hub-and-spokes model / star topology of secure IOUs that can be passed around off-blockchain.
Can someone find a way to make a mesh of IOUs where claims are floating around in standard sized chunks, like 1 bitcoin, 10 bitcoin, 100 bitcoin etc, and smaller fragments, and (maybe in some odd sizes), but whereby anyone anywhere on the bitcoin network could take that timelocked IOU for you and spend it if you could see the permission travelling from one end of the chain to the other. And anyone could settle them out to the blockchain if they want to but no one has to. You might confirm it all out as a checkpoint, like monthly/quarterly/annually, but not something you would do with every transaction. That'd be very interesting. Something odd, like offline ring signatures in a big pool. That settles back to bitcoin if people let it all expire out.
@_date: 2019-09-11 21:31:21
??? well it's open source :/
So I know this sounds nuts but anyone can take bitcoin, fork it, and add/remove features. Sometimes if you only remove or restrict something it's just a soft fork. Other times you can hard fork.
So I know it sounds strange but you could make a cryptocurrency with new features and run with it and see how it goes, and sometimes people get enough ideas that they really go for it :)

Bizarrely, depending on the units of account people are using, all three could feel like winners.
The exchange is getting a cut. Pretend we're talking euros instead of bitcoins here...
Some guy puts their euros in, and lends them (Bob) so that people can short the hell out of it if they want. Holding euros makes Bob long the euro. Then Alice gets in, with leverage shorts the hell out of euros. The exchange gets their cut as a middleman, keeping the profits in whatever (dollars or euros, their discretion).
In the end, Bob made interest on his euros (which went down in value viz dollars, but ... from Bob's accounting, he actually has more euros than when he started /facepalm). And Alice has more dollars than whens she started (!?!?) and the Exchange made money too.

It's made me wonder why banks get to occupy such a special role.
Take for example LendingClub. You can go to LendingClub and offer to loan people money. You upload cash from your bank via ACH. You browse de-identified loans and try to judge credit worthiness. There's a lot of variables involved. In the end, you help finance loans to people, but in a very real way you are taking on a ton of risk. If people don't pay back, you get wiped out on your share of that note. 
You think about it for a second, maybe get $1000 into a system like that, and it dawns on you - that banks are allowed to do this as long as they have a fraction in reserve. And they earn interest on all the loans they choose to keep, but they could always bundle up and sell of in batches any they don't want, so they can change lending strategies.
And it dawns on you ..... who died and made them king? Why do they get to have such a special place in society? 
If you had a few thousand lenders, organized like LendingClub, but effectively doing a lot of the work of a bank's Loan Officer in miniature, and taking a ton of risk on -- don't believe the hype because you might only make 2-5% on your capital -- 
Anyway, it just jumps out at you that if you were a bank leveraged 10:1 you could make 20-50% on your capital, and if you were Goldman Sachs who went to 47:1 during the financial meltdown --
If you were Goldman Sachs -- if the economy is going great, you make 47:1 on your money -- and that's all yours, but if the economy tanks, then you get bailed out.
Why??? This is such an incredibly unfair system.

@_date: 2016-10-27 16:11:43
I kind of think that we should start to create alternate bitcoins - something like bitcoin, but with different proof of work algos, something more CPU/GPU dependent (ideally GPU - a CPU algo would become a botnet-coin, whereas GPUs being used for mining -- you would notice the usage if it was a hacker, so GPU would be better, ideally using whatever GPU language is equivalent to a proof of work language. That way as we buy GPU cards to mine coins, gamers get better graphics cards along the way. So maybe it could be a proof of work based on triangles, or based on some kind of unpredictable PhysX properties, or a mix of algos).
Anyway, after that, scale the coins to millions of parallel coin chains and maybe let you merge mine your favorite 10 or so whatever that limit is,
And then build a system to trade scarce coins through some big market. 
So if bitcoin is attacked, you would have thousands and thousands of parallel side coins each their own blockchain and it would be infeasible to take them all out.
But even better if their activity looked like ordinary web browsing.

Everyone has their pet theories. Toxic community, ironic that scammers and get-rich-quick times tended to glam on. I'm not 100% sure Satoshi was as Libertarian as the first big users, maybe maybe not. And then also Satoshi, in theory, had around a million of the bitcoins. Or did he/she?
Because later on, Satoshi wants to mine and finds out that GPU mining has become a thing faster than they thought...  Why does Satoshi even care or want to mine anymore? They have millions of bitcoins. Good for others if they're off and mining on AMD rigs (at the time). Could've just announced that they weren't going to try to keep up with the  mining arms race, but good for others if they're doing that...
And bitcoin moves swiftly from CPU to GPU to FPGA to ASICs, and I think somewhere in there, between CPU and GPU switchover, I think Satoshi lost their keys. 
I think then Satoshi struggled to get some mining in, but was falling behind even the GPU race.
Then Satoshi gave up, dropped out of the community or died, just my guesses though.

Does bitcoin have to have more than 1% of the population using it to be a success?

Well at this point, in a stock market where stocks that do dividends are kind of out of date compared to stock buybacks / capital gains;
Well then, almost anything is "gambling" but that lame definition.
If he said speculation, then that would be true.
But a speculation is not a gamble. Gambling should have odds you could at least in theory work out.
A speculation is more like a future-casting mindset that has to imagine the implications and make some decisions.
The good thing you can say about bitcoin is that it's so risky that everyone can see a lot of different risks with it, so to some degree risk is priced in.
But in "risk free" stuff, or things that seem nearly risk free (mortgage backed securities as an example), you're not getting paid to take on the risk, so you get left (or someone - taxpayers!) gets left holding the back on that risk free crap.
At least in bitcoin we take our own risks, fucking banker wankers.

I think China looking the other way supplying fentanyl is what's fueling the crisis. Dealers apparently cut their drugs with cheap things they can import. There are big drug labs in Mexico and other places too that are making all kinds of drugs. It's a major criminal enterprise. Something our Society can't seem to get a grips with is removing the profit in drugs, making people happy so they don't seek drugs, being more understanding about why people could use drugs (depression, psychonauts, sprituality, home remedy cures), and making the pain on Society of addled addicts easier to bear too.

I'm not sure. I think the current price of bitcoin alone is enough to make you wonder about the dollar. Do you have a number in dollars that bitcoin could reach (all other purchasing prices being the same in dollars, like bread would cost the same) where you would think - on the price alone - that bitcoin is a dollar rival?
Would it be $10million dollar bitcoin?

If it was 8&amp; of US citizens ("Americans" heh), then you would have a lot more people who knew something about it, and/or a lot more libertarian attitudes out there - since the currency is also a mirror of the holder's politics to some degree.

I just dont see Soros as a boogeyman
He only takes advantage of banks that try to artificially prop up their currencies, like the Bank of England tried.
Banks shouldnt even be trying to do that. Instead their currencies should be subject to market forces.
Currencies trade against each other, and if it wasn't that, it would be something else. And whatever could trade against something else, in a liquid way, would become the new currency.
(That something else might be bitcoin. It might be more liquid, more powerful, harder to dilute, rock solid. This should get interesting.)
That is just how things are.
I personally wish that he'd stop doing what he does at the scale he does it, but if it's possible for someone somewhere to do what he's doing, someone will, and then that person would be the demonized boogeyman.

He's coming at it from the wrong direction but not totally wrong. There are estimates that in the stock market, 1 dollar in or out, has a 5x effect. In bitcoin the estimate is that 1 dollar in or out, has a 50x effect. But the takeaway from there, that I see, is not that bitcoin is huge and fake, just that it's not a very large market and no one has to sell or buy really, and there's no Plunge Protection Team there to save the day when it takes a 3% hit, etc, etc. So basically, hot money is in bitcoin and other cryptos, and that volatility is incredibly attractive if you put a straddle on it, and trade in a range watching for breakouts. In the end, you could make fortunes holding it, trading it, and watching as adoption grows and grows.

I just don't see Tether in that light.
I think that Tether is mildly brilliant, but like a lot of things in bitcoin-land can quickly get flipped onto it's ear and become an exit scam / bankruptcy, and get that spun into losses for people who were holding Tethers and who hoped to either buy bitcoin, or get dollars with their Tethers.
So how I see it, you get some bank accounts in a country, and people of that country deposit to it, and some do withdrawls, but they're all "locals". From the banks point of view, there are no unknown persons here. If the Tether people were super smart, they would insist that people have bank accounts at the same bank. Then there's not even any settlement, it would all be just money moving between pockets at a bank, and the bigger the bank, the more customers could be pocketed, and the less any cash leaves their system (it would only exist digitally). So ING in the Netherlands is a great example.
Now out at the people controlling Tether between exchanges, they can do a net settlement with the Tether company (bitfinex people wearing a corporate veil actually), and exchanges, but from the banks point of view, there is no volume of money moving around. 
Tether *hides* the volumes being transacted here.  It puts banks to sleep. They have less odd multimillion dollar wires to report. It makes the exchanges activities much more opaque and less the banks problem. What they don't see they won't block or can't block.
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:03:58


"positive" changes are in the eye of the beholder, only sometimes do people agree with you.
And in real life unfortunately, most people think that money should just magically be given to them to make life more fair. They don't want anyone else to be poorer necessarily, they just want the records to show that they have more of the accounting metric assigned to them. Basically they would vote for inflation, or a somewhat or very inflationary schedule, and a debased money supply.
So as bitcoin struggles to scale, it gets help from Johnny-come-latelys who didnt' buy bitcoin back in the day (or honestly as much as they would have, had they known bitcoin would be so big and valuable - back when bitcoin was pennies, or a $1 each, or $400~ last year) and they try and help.
Most of the smartest ones band together and go make their own coin with new features and leave bitcoin alone. The real masochists try to convince the bitcoin community for change. But the community can hardly spot the well-meaning from amongst the daft and the shysters. So it just freezes up. Right now there's a boom in the altcoins, and it's probably because people see bitcoin failing to scale and be private enough and simple and usable enough as the main and only crypto. But other cryptos are trying to scale, trying to be more privacy-centric, (or I guess programmable code as Law experiements like the DAO), or are vehicles to make the ones that run it richer as scams or pump-n-dumps.

Eh, I mean bitcoin isn't centralized, so there isn't really one voice or one place to go look for news. But I'm kind of against censorship too.

Being able to print money out of nothing is why the Vietnam war went on for so long, and why we had to move to fiat dollars in the US. Plus it was getting absurd since the dollars we had in circulation were in no way really backed by gold, and I think the French called us on it, and tried to cash out their dollars for gold. Then Nixon closed the gold window and we've been on made up money since. Notice that standards of living dont seem much improved for the same amount of work hours? Doesn't make a lot of sense that that would happen in such an automated world, unless it means that the wealth is not going to the middle class anymore for a million reasons, including fiat money.

(maybe you composed the question on a speech-to-text input?)
It sounds like you're asking - "What is the significance of these seals being broken?"
The packaging is for a secure USB hardware device to print paper wallets. The seals are hologram stickers. They're broken which indicates someone opened the sealed box the USB devices come in.
People have various theories about why, around the world, these are being opened up. 
They're not being covertly opened, which just means that the fact it's been opened means that the mail is being at least inspected. 
How far this has gone, like - did they plug the USB drive into something to read the contents? Or did they X-Ray it? Or did they put new replacement - Trojan Horse - firmware onto the device? I saw a theory that the words "Mycelium" (something associated with mushrooms) might have made Customs think it was about drugs. And maybe they know it's about bitcoin. And maybe they think it's a USB device which could have illegal porn on it. 
I think that because the opening is not covert, and the device might have been tampered with, a medium course of safety is to flash/replace the firmware. After that, how trustworthy it is depends on how paranoid you are.
The NSA for sure has a group called TAO - Tailored Access Operations - check out the Wikipedia article on it - 
I think that at this point, it's an up in the air - but in my opinion a "no" - as to whether or not the NSA has their own Trojan Horse firmware for these devices, or if the entire device has been covertly replaced with a completely Trojan Horse usb device.
That would be similar to having the NSA intercept or try to get the secret seeds for Entrust / SecurID hardware tokens. Have they done that? 99% chance of a YES to that. 
But have they done that for these little Mycelium things? I'd say less than a 1% chance they've got TAO on it.
If you use a Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook computer to deal with bitcoin - that's where your real weak point is. 
So for me, the Mycelium is probably still trustworthy-ish - as-is. So I will move a few bitcoin onto it. Not all but some.

Sure, but how much should a node cost? Throw a USD number out there. $1000 to buy the node's hardware - mb, CPU, RAM, hard drive, maybe SSD, network card - and $50/month for networking? And -- it's a depreciating asset so depreciate it to nothing in 5 years or earlier.
So throwing that number out there, you should be able to handle cable modem speeds of 1gigabit, and 12+ gigs of RAM, and at least a terabyte drive.
And those are today's costs. 
Tommorrow's costs might - for $50/month - take your network to 10gig, your hard drive to 10 terabytes, etc, for $1000. Computing power is exploding in every direction -- do not hold bitcoin back for the knuckleheads that want to use a 2600 baud modem and a TI 99/4a!!!

They need a soft fork to fix a certain kind of malleability, but after that they need about two bitcoin transactions to set up a "circuit" - after that you can offline transact as fast as you want, and you can make a whole mesh of these circuits. You can always still use the bitcoin blockchain if you want to, but most people would only need to make a couple circuits a month - anytime they wanted to have a paying relationship to a new business, like to pay bills, etc. Maybe. :)

In case devs wanted to be able to "ShapeShift" the coins, is there a way they can do that, like put up a bond with ShapeShift.io, help with programming their altcoins' wallet or daemon in a unix or Windows VM, and then driving it (buys/sells) with some automation via some kind of APIs?

I can imagine that you could do pretty well -- have some ad channels for non-shady bitcoin exchanges (maybe keep it to the list at bitcoinwisdom.com etc)
And then see if some of the outlets will let you translate and run their articles.
And then post up your own articles / meetups, and if it was in Arabic and English, you could get a pretty good following.
Especially if you had some doing editorials.
There's a lot of news that (I know, I for one) don't want to face. Like bitcoin is completely standing to one side of the whole finance system and pure bitcoin can be sent from place to place frictionlessly. This will inevitably be used to fund 'terrorism', remittances (harmless?), and possibly purchase goods from embargoed countries (Persian shoes, Iran?)
Having a site that faces those issues head on and talks about a future world without financial controls over who sends what funds to where -- does that mean that instead of embargoes, we wind up having low-level drone wars instead, everywhere? Ugh. Not a world I want.
I bet there's big potential in the Middle East for bitcoin, but I for one know so little about the whole area. 
I bet you can make a great site.

Argument that bitcoins go from hand to hand, and made an argument that a loan that went through Satoshi Dice could still be chased down by a Tony Soprano.
No that's not how bitcoins work - bitcoins don't have serial numbers, they are not works of art that are easily known and have owners and can be returned by the cops to their rightful owners if they're ever found. Bitcoins flow in and out of transactions and may or may not get merged into other larger puddles of bitcoin. Sometimes you can get a wallet with a private address in it, and use that to recoup the lost bitcoins.
If someone at BTCJam makes a bitcoin loan (like Tony Soprano), to someone else that loses the bitcoins at Satoshi Dice, in today's world they can pound sand.
If you modify the players a little bit - if a commercial bank made a loan to someone, and they instantly spent the bitcoins at a Lamborghini dealership to buy a car instead of investing it in their business .... , and the Lamborghini dealership sent the bitcoins to Coinbase, who gave back fiat, but then started selling bitcoins out to other people...
The commercial bank might have fantasies that they can chase this all the way to Coinbase but it's not going to work like that. What they'll be left with are the assets of the scammer - a used Lamborghini. The rest of the bitcoin system will make them pound sand.

They're signed transactions though and wouldn't make sense if the integrity was affected (altered). 
They could be delayed, cut off, tampered with and made invalid, but they should be pretty small messages and probably pretty hard to filter out.
You could probably make a UDP sprayer that made tons of maybe similar looking requests and have some real bitcoin transactions in it and then forward that to a receiver that passed it to a node to a miner etc.

That's so cool to make circuits out of bitcoin, instead of every transaction.
The main concept seems to be to get enough channel width by setting aside a chunk of bitcoin in escrow, and then go back and forth on that channel with other people and some other (the bigger the better) participants in the lightning network.
Like if Overstock, Dell, Expedia, New Egg, and others took on big central lumps of bitcoin, and then the channel partners set up bitcoin circuits between all of them and the whole thing could be buzzing along making payments - all the payments off blockchain, but the circuit setup on blockchain.
Super interesting ideas.

If bitcoin is a cryptocurrency value network, the only thing that could replace it is a cryptocurrency network with even more value.  
Some of the value is in the trust that it will grow and others will struggle to replace it in value (speculation), some of the value is in what it can already do (basic payments, buying things), some of the value is in how it's succeeding even though in theory governments can try to squash it, and some speculative value is in the idea that it will overcome it's limitations (transactions per second), and some value in that it's truly decentralized, in theory it crosses boundaries between nation states that hate each other, it's beyond the reach of the existing banking and government cartels to freeze the assets without seizing the owners (which they can still do sometimes), ... and into all that it has first mover advantage.
It might last ... a new comer with more value could spring up, but why would a bank or government burn billions of dollars of value to make a bigger cryptocurrency, which for it to continue to grow, has to be beyond their influence?
I think the only thing that could beat bitcoin now is an insanely fast confirming currency, which anyone can mine (some weird form of Proof of Stake?), which anyone can use today without having to set anything up and jumpstart themselves some value (airdrop++), which is hugely superior in an anonymity standpoint (ring signatures, Shamir Secret Sharing, or other moon maths), but which is also super incredibly easy to understand for beginners (is damn near obvious), quickly accepted by governments for paying taxes, but also not subject to theft or extortion, .......  I don't see most of this happening anytime soon. 
So I see bitcoin will just suck in value from alts, alts will keep springing up inside communities then get gutted as people sell over to bitcoin to actually buy something, but there's probably space for hundreds or millions and millions of alts - forever. Maybe someday everyone will have their own coin.

Yes just through popularity, you can signal (would depend on the coin) but in something like bitcoin, miners can flag that they would like to see or would support a change in the protocol.
IN something like bitcoin, you can make the rules tighter and more strict by opting into a tighter and more strict set of rules and then if you enough success at that, for long enough, you've proven that the mining power supports it (or have you?) but anyway, and then you've soft-forked into it.
A hard fork, like giving yourself more bitcoins, takes raw hashpower to fork over to, to succeed. But any coin takes users that don't abandon it too, a community of users to succeed as well.

I agree, because once they can fit about 50 million transactions in a block, then everyone can have a bitcoin transaction a day. So at least one big purchase, daily.
If a typical transaction could be made of something like 5 inputs and 5 outputs, maybe that transaction would be about ... say 1.5 kilobytes ... so 75 gig blocks?
It could happen.  Once we're up to home users having exabyte disks and networks that can push gigabytes per second, like 10gig to the home, and have that be common, maybe!

Was malleability an accident, or just something that can happen because there's no canonical way to do the same thing?
Like, is malleability similar to "2 + 3 = 5" just as "3 + 2 = 5"? So that the malleable nature of the transaction involves moving pieces and parts around, making a new transaction, but which amounts to the same thing as the original ... and is somehow exploitable?

When Marco Polo came back from China with silver certificates (paper) from their rule (a Khan?) - the Medici as a group were really angry.  They wanted actual silver, not paper. They burned the silver certificates.  Marco Polo tried to explain that the certificates were as good as silver(!!!)
Basically they thought the fiat of the Khan were worthless promises.
The tricky problem is of course they are not worthless. Maybe they were not literal silver coins, but they were worth something(!)
In somewhat the same way, bitcoin gives you digital scarcity (of bitcoin - not of cryptocurrencies in general) - and that's kind of a new thing entirely.
Before now, if you had a bunch of banks keeping individual glorified spreadsheets of how much money they had, with a few complicated tricks and some sleight of hand, you could give yourself some more money.. it's all 1's and 0's.
But with bitcoin there's a universal ledger, and the security is checked by people willing to run miners to earn bitcoins in the system.

Well, to take your question seriously for a second...
If ECDSA gets cracked, you'd have to hardfork and I think that restoring the trust in bitcoin would be hard, and it might end the bitcoin cryptocurrency. There'd be other cryptos and they would rise in value and probably be ready to take over.
For Satoshi's coins specifically, I think Satoshi mined and kept the outputs separate and never spent them, so they never revealed partial information. So I think you have to crack RIPEMD-160 too for those.
Anyone got better info?

Also, second reply -- I'm pretty sure that it was this exact comment that talked my logical brain out of buying any, posted by Anonymous Coward:
" by Anonymous Coward on Thursday February 10, 2011  (
From the site,
The total eventual circulation will be 21 million bitcoins. There will never be more coins than that. The coins are entering circulation gradually, at a steady pace over many years, to nodes supporting the network in proportion to the CPU time they contribute. With the current total CPU power on the network, most CPUs will usually take months between successfully generating 50 BTC.
So basically, this is like "collector items", not currency. A very scare "resource", if you can call it that. You get 50 BTC after few months, meaning that basically you've just spent $50 in electricity to get your "free" money.
Anyway, this virtual "currency" is bad for so many reasons, it's not even funny. Fist, the purpose of currency is not to hoard it - it is to spend it for goods/services. Currency is IOU notes that devalue over time. It is not a hard asset, like coal or copper or shares of MegaAssInc. FIAT currency tends to be *backed* by something, like an economy, like USA or European Union or even China. What is this backed by?
Anyway, another fad "currency". Might as well collect "ISK in eveonline" or "gold nuggets in WoW" - same thing.

(Problem being if they used literally bitcoin's SHA-256, a tiny farm could show up and blow up their whole shebang, so they'd have to build in a bunch of the weird tech that altcoins use to defeat that.)
I wonder if it could be merge-mined with bitcoin, like Namecoin, so that they could have the bitcoin security. 
Surely there's a bitcoiner that could describe what they should do? Any way to get bitcoin security without bloating the bitcoin blockchain? Power it off it's own altcoin?

That makes sense - I can imagine it would turn out that way..


Imagine how many people own 0.1btc vs how many people own 10kbtc. Lack of supply will make the price go up, so people will have an incentive to lump their coins together not split them up.
Ah right, like if someone wants to mix 100 bitcoins, just once, they need say 3 or 5 or 7 other people t mix 100 bitcoins with.  
After mixing, do the people offering the mixing just stay online? If outputs start to go back to one address with a large value there, doesn't that work against the mixing? Not sure.




Thanks so much for sharing the code, and implementing it and if I can I would try to help, especially if I wind up doing it as a mixer. I like how you've put together these ideas.

Vitalik seems smart, I think he saw what was happening with bitcoin, felt like he missed the boat and decided to just make his own coin / system with features that he liked.
There's a lot of self-interest in seeing bitcoin succeed by holders of bitcoin, so they might not be singing it's praises because they don't have a vested interest in Etherium...
I'm wondering myself if Proof of Stake coins become problematic - because there's nothing at stake. In that, if you have some of proof of stake coin A, you can go get some of proof of stake coin B, and it doesn't seem like you have to give anything up to attack them.
With bitcoin, you had to actually buy ASICs or something to attack it, or spend time thinking about different kinds of attacks - like spam, Sybil attacks, game theory etc. 
I dunno.

Sure okay, you've done well to tap into my cognitive dissonance - I love bitcoin and hate coal power plants. Congrats I guess? Nothing you can say will make me dislike bitcoin or like coal power plants. This is a case where, speaking for myself, I LOVE bitcoin, and the positive of bitcoin outweighs some jerks at the edges using coal. Because they're not the only coal power plant in the world, and its not a big enough reason to dislike bitcoin, imho.

That's an interesting article - something about plea bargains I don't understand - if you plea bargain are you in some way someone they can put right back in jail on a whim and/or deny you employment or something? It sounds much worse than how it's sold to the public.
I can comprehend the idea that if you don't plea bargain and whatever it is you're found guilty of gets overturned as not a crime, that if you don't plea bargain you are free forever, but if you plea bargained you are still stuck?

Yeah my impression was that rooting the app could increase the security (or decrease it) -- depended on what the user did next. 
Maybe they use the rooting in order to limit app permissions even more, or to get rid of vendor-supplied spyware and backdoors.
Or maybe they use the rooting to make the phone less secure.
They could do either (or whatever).

Okay. Well it's like anything where someone wants to use electrical power. If a market thinks that something is valuable enough, like aluminum foil, then people will burn coal somewhere to make it. So ... ban the use of coal plants and cookfires and wasted cow methane and many other pollutants, I am all for it. This is like plastic in the ocean, runoff from fertilizer, wasted fresh water, all kinds of problems.
Market externalities, tragedies of the commons, etc, that's a big deal with Capitalism anywhere you find it. Mostly Capitalism helps people, but pollution is a great example of how it doesn't deal well with problems it creates for everyone.

There's a bitcointalk.org thread on making a self-directed IRA.
Then you can 'invest' (speculate) on bitcoin, you just have to be super careful not to engage in self-dealing - like selling yourself your own bitcoin (as a way to launder it I guess or to effectively get funds out of your retirement?)
Doable, some have apparently done it, but it's beyond what I have time to set up for myself.
I personally think a bitcoin Roth IRA makes more sense if you're 50+ years old ... because if bitcoin goes POW and skyrockets in value 50,000% ... why wait until you're 59 1/2 years old to get the pay out? :)

Apparently the scammers know that the ransom is enough to keep local police from bothering to get involved. I mean, they don't seem to get very involved when someone has their gas tank sugared, or when someone gets assaulted. $500 flies under their radar. They don't have the manpower to go after every little criminal, they can't spend $5000 in manhours for this. Sometimes, like this one, the reputational harm is bigger than the $500 - you can tell because it made the news. So by definition, the school had a reputation at stake.

Premines are (depending on the size of the premine!) a way for the original coin creators to dump coins whenever they want money.

That is odd that Mastercard would mention cryptocurrencies. 
Bitcoin is so small compared to anything they care about. Maybe just trying to cover all bases in case of shareholder's questions - eg "Q: have you considered ..."? "A: Yes."
I did think it was interesting that they described their payment system as a fourth party payer. Like a middle man of middle men?

It could help prevent a weird North Korean style abuse of bitcoin - eg the leadership gets a pile of true bitcoins, but then walls off their people so that they can't check the true blockchain. This lets you check coin spends even if you are cut off from the Internet...? (maybe that's what it's for, just guessing what the value of a satellite blockchain feed would be?)

Off-topic from bitcoin, but interesting to see the link to seed factories.
I was thinking the other day about how some large countries and places, like Japan, Germany, California, and New York, can be seen as 'factories' that are capable of producing pretty much anything humankind knows how to make - nuclear weapons, CPUs, vaccines, cars, and so on. So Right now they represent kind of the smallest scale 'factories' that can produce 'anything we know of'.
I wonder is the seed factory meant to be: 'Any technology made in or around 1920 or so, as long as the results fit in the building'? And excluding some super hard metals and other exotic stuff? Was just curious if there was a target set of outputs or something for a factory like that - it looks like it's meant to reproduce itself (kind of, not from raw iron ore, but from some feedstock) and maybe make a few other goods if it has some specialized tools.

You have to build another layer on it (insurance, some 3rd party judge or Oracle that can make you whole). Tough to do, because you could just be scamming them... 
Pretend this future alternative cryptocurrency is going to be more trusted and valued than bitcoin ... and includes reversibility, but crosses nation-state boundaries, and is not under their control. Under whose control? Maybe something like a Proof of Stake could be used to reverse a pile of transactions or null them out. But doubtful. Breaks fungibility ... like the old Scottish case of stolen bank notes, the way the courts decided the case set the mold for how we see money and it's power today. And it seems unlikely that a new digital cash / bearer instrument, is ever going to have reversibility as a part of itself (it's a feature that it's irreversible, not a bug).

I think that cryptonote coins are giving it a run - would have more info


Any coin with value is taking value away from bitcoin, and vice-versa. You can't be invested in all coins. (Well unless one was a part of a premine scam on some or all of your holdings, etc).


Black markets are generally not open to VISA. I'm not a black market participant, but I love financial privacy and I think that all people should have it. People will paint whatever picture they like about bitcoin, some are very passionate about turning people away from it. Sometimes I think they have good intentions, like trying to steer people away from get-rich-quick schemes and the lottery. (But I think it's futile to steer people away from that because playing the lottery is beyond logic. Still, if someone is being scammed, I am not in favor of blaming the victims  - we have to go after the scammers. But bitcoin can be very strongly anonymous and draws in scammers and get-rich-quick types. Even if someone is not very into get-rich-quick schemes, they often get bitcoin and wish it could "work for them" so they wind up wildly increasing their speculative risk / gamble, and go for bitcoin denominated loans, altcoin trading, bitcoin trading, bitcoin denominated stocks, "Initial Coin Offers", and things like that and maybe don't realize that having bitcoin is not that kind of game.)
Any crypto currency that took over black markets would be huge. The black market or Shadow Economy, sometimes called Systeme D, is really big.
I'm personally not into bitcoin for anything like that. I'm in it for the crypto, the math, the computer science, and the left-libertarianism (Freeeeeedom!)


Maybe. But it might also take some of the mask of of government oppression. Bitcoins or an altcoin with unbelievable privacy, could make life better or honestly make it worse. A technology might get forced on people where it becomes very hard to detect bribery of politicians, or where they can loot the treasury of a country and there's no where to turn to to find the money or get it returned. Everyone may appear to have no financial assets but somehow still be wealthy tax-evaders like Greece. Government tax collectors might practically become like the old Roman tax collectors and their shakedowns and take tribute from regional places rather than try some kind of "Just" taxation. Who knows? Bitcoin might make the State *more* repressive. If they can't print money out of thin air, government might literally just become thugs that tell you to hand over some bitcoin or else you wind up in a prison cell, beaten up, or disappeared. Not exactly a wonderful world! Right-Libertarians are probably hoping that Government shrivels for lack of tax compliance, loses support by having to resort to violence, and then just dies, and somehow free markets fill in the blanks. I am not sure what will happen. Who can see the future?
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:00:56


Yeah it's a good thing. But if there's a small fervent core that the protocol MUST change, they might honestly be better off making their own coin. They get to be early holders then too.

How did this PayCoin thing start?
Was it a reseller of mining equipment, that became a pool, that became 'mining rental' (hashlets?), that became tokens of ownership in the company itself that represented hypothetical ever-replacing hash units (PayCoins?) and a made up deal with MasterCard, and piled on and on?
But you couldn't get your bitcoins back, they kept getting 'converted' to another thing in the chain or else you took a 90% loss (but at least escaped)?
@_date: 2015-03-06 00:00:24
Oh that's a really interesting point of view.
I bet those that support traditional fiat currencies are wondering really, how a currency can get going without being fiat. Whereas to bitcoin fans/observers, bitcoin is clearly 'flying' (soaring, crashing, whatever).

Eh, I've made my own models, and anyone can, where I modelled out a 5% drop in bitcoin dominance per year as a steady downward trend, towards 0.
So near the end, when bitcoin dominance is around 5%, I had bitcoin value being about 11,000 USD, but it's splitting market share with so many coins that if all those other alts didn't exist, and it absorbed their market share it *would* be worth 220,000 USD.
So, sadly, this like Ethereum is a good example of the phenomenon, every late-to-the-game coin is showing up, seeing the terrific wealth of bitcoin and thinking they missed out, they're using their brains and their ability to market and spin up a network effect to make their own side coin.  With bitcoin as a model, they can easily tweak and craft a narrative and play a get-rich-quick model out.
So, though bitcoin is scarce, crypto-currencies aren't. This means we're going to have millions of altcoins, some worth nearly nothing. Just like anyone can write '$1' on a napkin and issue it.
And by the way, I don't think Etherium is a final winner either. Each coin that comes along and gets a major following - for any enduring reason - is enough.  So that means Litecoin, Dogecoin.  But some coins with interesting ideas that have fallen by the wayside like Feathercoin, they obviously come and go. The point is the overall rising share of all alts vs bitcoin.

Wow Solidity on bitcoin via 2-way peg to RSK?
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:11:25
The headers have the Merkle Tree for the transaction and that got hashed into Proof of Work and becomes set.  The raw data would be in the rest of the block and you need that too but it could come along.
I think with the inverted Bloom Filter you can figure out if a given transaction was in a given block or not without having to see the whole contents of the block. Good enough to know if it's spent already.
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:50:26
Logically, I mean everyone wants to use less energy, and I think we all want to make it so that you can't "attack" a coin unless you are participating - holding would be ideal right ;) ? - but mining seems to be the way we align incentives - you spend external resources (energy, time, USD money, forgoing spending on other things) in order to earn tokens internal to the system (bitcoins) via Proof of Work.
But honestly, between the paper that just got re-clarified about POW vs POS and Vitalik's amazing abilities to come up with ideas like "The Slasher", I am just kind of not very qualified to say whether or not POS can't ultimately be a big success....
The big mining farms are probably not what Satoshi envisioned -- maybe they had the assumption that commodity CPUs from Intel and AMD were really efficient and could do SHA256 as fast as anything out there. But was thinking of hordes of distributed PCs having WAY more computing power than the latest supercomputers (which were just large numbers of commodity CPUs) - I wonder if GPU to FPGA to ASIC ever occurred to them or if it was kind of a surprise and outside the model of what they were thinking would happen.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:06:41
Really fascinating. I love how you're trying to solve a CoinJoin with market forces.
I see you have it using some python scripts. And somehow this reads from a wallet that would have Test net coins. The python scripts would also connect into an IRC channel (authenticate, encrypt), and then call out market orders open pit style, cool.
If your bug testing goes well,
When this is in the production network,
Is the ideal participant someone with a Bitcoin Core wallet, or Armory, or Electrum, running on a linux machine (ubuntu?) - with about 10 to 1000 bitcoin in the wallet - 
And then you can set this script up to bid / sign on some number of transactions?
Some concerns - I can see the fee %'s go out. So if Sybil gets in the channel and participates, can they guess who got paid what by the fees attached? The fees would seem to go for sure to particular people. Later if they use those fees in a wallet, I can guess it's them and not the person tumbling.  Would some randomness around the fees paid be helpful? 
And is it best to have, say you want 5 people to sign, does it force it to be evenly sized pieces by each signer? Can I game this system by having 5 small accounts, so that I get to sign and participate in as many signings as possible? (It's not helping them much because they're mixing with one other person). Maybe as part of opsec, the IRC channel should let you see the IP address of who is connecting? and mark if they are VPN / TOR etc? And maybe if they have a root key that they mix over and over from so that they could announce that too and you could inspect these mixer people and get a sense of how good they seem to be at mixing things and truly how much bitcoin they have there? Not sure. I guess I just want to know who the large bitcoin wallets and old established tumblers are. If they're getting too established, then I know they're a tumbler; not sure how this games out.
Visualizing the order book for mixing - it would be a really interesting graph .... it could show how many coins you can mix (the market depth) as a height, and going out on the X axis (getting worse) would be the interest rate you pay to mix? I wonder how others would visualize that (maybe the other way around).
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:08:36
Probably 3 years or never lol. Er, one sec, depends .... 
Cryptocurrencies generally are a whole rising market driven thing. A lot of late comers are going to make up their own coins to scam people or to be in charge of the next big thing.
So maybe bitcoin's market share will drop by about 5% a year until bitcoin just about goes away in 15 years. But to be a small slice of a very large market is still a big thing.
So I'd give it about 3-5 years. It would happen faster if it was the only cryptocurrency to ever exist, but it will be watered down by money flowing into altcoins.

Because it's like money and bound to have the fiat to bitcoin and back sides of it girded all around by regulation - I am betting on "slow as molasses" on the uptake. Unfortunate, but that's how I see it.
The smart ones that missed out on being bitcoin early adopters will band together to make their own altcoins until they run out of steam, which will be a long time. And they'll be able to make objectively superior coins, except for the lack of adoption. Unless a billionaire weighs in behind one... (which they won't).

I hope bitcion keeps working for you. It's nice to hear you have 10x the bandwidth I thought. Being an early adopter, of course you want it to keep working.
Quick pause for thought - bitcoin is keeping a complete ledger of the whole blockchain, and each one is keeping its own local picture (possibly slightly incomplete by its nature) of the unmined transactions that aren't yet in a block. And it is redundantly copying it - across something like 5000 nodes worldwide. 
So that's like having RAID 1 x 5000 in terms of cost - but also benefit. 
Communication is a little bit of a separate problem, since the design in my opinion is trying to keep the nodes up to date on something that matters, like when will a given transaction ever get mined unless it gets communicated to miners?  ANd logically if you want any miner to mine it, and tthe mining farms are front-ended by a full node, then logically you want all those nodes to know about a transaction - and that requires network bandwidth.
Just color me suprised though that a 1 meg block, and transactions that vary in size but honestly arent that large are actually eating more than a completely trivial amount of bandwidth. Unless people are making transactions that have no hope of getting mined and are doing a DoS attack on the nodes' bandwidth and memory or soemthing.
Okay anyway, since you run a node you have first hand experience with it.

I care about my fellow man, but some low bandwidth 1200 baud connection with 640k ram?  That is not the target for a node, nor should it ever be.
You have to find a sweet spot where you maximize the number of users able to participate with SPV clients, full nodes to a percentage of those users you think keeps the system healthy, and then get real because if bitcoin gets big, you may need an even higher end kind of node that can handle gigabyte sized blocks if you want to include **EVERYONE**
What you leave in and what you leave out of bitcoin is a balancing act. If bitcoin is small it can only serve a few directly. They have to use off chain solutions like LN if bitcoin is tiny.
If bitcoin got big blocks, it limits people with small computers and drinking straw network pipes, but meh?   It allows easier direct participation without LN middle men.

Sounds like a bit of a dick comment, but a node should probably be about 1/2 to 1 bitcoin in cost a year, that gives us an approximate idea of how much network, CPU, RAM, and disk to budget for.
I don't think it should be ~10 bitcoin, and I don't think it should be 1/100th of a bitcoin either. There is some middle size that's suitable.
And we don't need unlimited numbers of these nodes, maybe 5000? Maybe 2000? Maybe 10000? To me, the node count seems about right but I don't know how to compare node capability. It seems easy to head-fake Sybil attack by running lots of fake nodes to make fake support for bitcoin changes.

* Provision a trusted miners patch
* change to Proof of Work so the attackers hardware doesn't work against you. Maybe make it a hybrid of existing SHA256 and some new thing.
Have the miners trust count as part of the proof of work and have it slowly fade out. Eg, count the trusted miner as one extra 0 in the Proof of Work. Eventually it won't matter but while you're under attack it can help.
Make a second proof of work system that also effectively adds zeros.
If you are attacked again, add zeros to the trusted miners patch. 
Rinse, repeat.

Coworker used to work at T-Mobile USA, said they could pull any - ANY - file off a phone. Did it routinely. 
I use Sprint basically but I'm sure the same is same. My phone's not rooted, I use Mycelium with the assumption that it's not 100% hacker proof because the underlying hardware is basically pwned by the phone company, law enforcement, the NSA (it's an Android phone, so Google too).
So just small amounts of BTC on a phone. I think that Mycelium itself has fairly good security but I don't have all of the expertise needed to evaluate the security of Android apps. If it was a vanilla C code that I could compile to a binary with gcc, then I could manage to understand the risks a little better of the raw code. That, and bitcoin itself is somewhat complicated.

"Bitcoin is not a naughty child – it challenges China’s national control of its money. It shouldn’t have been born" - 
EDIT: he has other articles too, all fun to read. It was great reading when things were getting tumultuous in China. 
My take is that China doesn't mind bitcoin as long as markets there are somewhat small and irrelevant or at least not much larger than Western markets. And if the West thinks that bitcoin is the future of finance or something, they have enough of it to get started in a big way if they want to, but it's no threat to them.

Yes and if another bank calls them on their BS, they can get a loan from the Fed at a good rate to cover it. So they can lend out at a mortgage, borrow from the Central Bank to cover that mortgage, and if they like package it up and sell it on to investors whether the investment is good or bad.

But ApplePay only works on Apple phones (their hardware) right?
And this is all communicated over Point-of-Sales terminals on an ApplePay network or is that an open network?
Is this is an open bank network where anyone with a credit card / banking account can get these token id things and put them into a specially hardened phone, like a hardened chip in an Samsung Galaxy?
And then on over a generic or open network, not an Apple network, you can relay these secure purchases back to your bank?
So as long as you have secure hardware with your special bank secret, it's truly between you and your bank?
Or is ApplePay an Apple-only thing? Or is ApplePay just some branding around something that's super wide open?
(Like if AppleID was actually just another Shibboleth ID, but at  and it's not really all that special, just confirms that that identity owns some apple products or made up an account) 
Isn't this centralized by Apple? Apple signing up banks, Apple iPhones having the right hardware, the right software, and a network of participants signed up by Apple, and closed to competitors? It's a "network" but isn't Apple at the center of the web getting payments?

Well if she agressively buys influence of the top 3 or 4 mining pools and secretly arranges in advance for that group to 51% attack bitcoin, and prefer whitelisted coins, deny blacklisted ones, etc. People in the other 49% will notice their transactions getting delayed, delayed, delayed, unfairly. The minority crowd will speak up and probably fork it's own coin, with a different mining algo tweak, because they'd have to, and there's not a lot of sense of joining an unfair and not fully fungible coin, even if it's network effect is bigger to start, so probably within a year, she'd find herself controlling a network that no one wants to be in ... and then, it falls apart and the miners that colluded will wish that they hadn't.
The bitcoin network does depend on a few things -- fairness (fungibility, no premine), attractive to join (easy to get some coins to try out, hard to work for some coins, well-secured transaction, coins accepted at many places for buying products), security (of transaction algorithms, of mining algorithms, of your privacy, etc) --
But one of the key things is in the ecosystem of miners: no miners big enough to 51% it, enough real competition so that while you might have some big pools the pools don't collude, internationalism to put mining farms out of reach of anyone but their own governments (and spread out), and a good amount of participation by average Joes who care (nodes and small miners in pools) to keep things honest and notice if there's problems.  If the majority of the hashing power is dishonest, it will be hard to fix. But if the hashing power is dedicated hardware (ASICs, not CPU/GPU which is lying around by the millions), it can be hard to redirect it to new problems and applications -- like if your community switches algorithms out from underneath you. And I would bet that the bitcoin community would hard fork to get away from her clutches.

Well the best part is that, as this split shows, you only need on-ramp and off-ramp companies in each country and those can be separate companies in partnership.
Unlike Western Union which is trying to be the on and off ramp on each side and comply with every jurisdiction.
Western Union's money transfer model is like having Comcast implement the Internet mostly by itself. It would obviously be a big barely working beast and be insanely profitable.
Having the remittance use bitcoin as a system lets you work with startups on each side, each with whatever AML/KYC/fingerprints you need on each end if you want cash out instead of just keeping it in bitcoin, which eliminates all those businesses if they just earn in bitcoin and spend in bitcoin on both ends. But, you go as you can.

Could be because they falsely believe that this will help the fight against terrorism - when obviously per the Charlie Hebdo case, the means (the how to) of terrorism is not expensive, the motive is just found in a few individuals - back dropped by a Religion that definitely is not about images of their Prophet and a secular Freedom of Speech France that naturally would satire those beliefs (along with some other issues, like how France and the immigrants don't really assimilate very well, maybe never will).
And, there's a chance that locking everything down in bank accounts does help a bail-in if it has to happen.

Ahhh you have many good points. Sometimes I wonder if part of this is going to be solved by architectural issues - like the hard drive problem - maybe our network segmented computers which process sensitive data are going to have to communicate out over a network wire, but otherwise be in a Faraday cage, out to another computer which is just a SAN. And what we send the SAN will be blocks of encrypted information, encrypted and salted and not just password protected, and maybe have a controller that is sending and reading/writing blocks all the time so that our traffic mixes in with other things (eg they couldn't tell if we were booting up or writing sensitive information, maybe because we write it many times to many places and read from it sometimes without needing it, etc) and use very large 'blocks' so that important system files, libraries and so on fit inside a block and they can't tell one from another by guesswork.

Okay sure.
What I meant, and I should have said more plainly, is that nodes aren't votes on a particular kind of bitcoin to run.
Bitcoin isn't really democracy and nodes aren't a vote 1:1 with a person who has an identity. So someone with a lot of resources could create the faked appearance of grass roots support for a bitcoin fork by spinning up thousands of cheap nodes.
Sybil attacks are a forged identity. Here of course, nodes are not identities. There is I think some kind of implicit assumption that 1 node = 1 major supporter of bitcoin. But that's not true.

And I think to cover her ass (and take the prosecution's side in it) she tried to nail them on it with a 16 page document. She snarked them by suggesting that 'Plan B' should be complying with her courts procedure.
I don't think that there's too much the defense could do. 
The defense wanted to have the ambiguity of server ownership play into 4th amendment search and seizure, but the judge chose to take the prosecution's side that it was either yours or not, so then you are or aren't DPR. But there could be other ambiguous situations like, it could be owned by you but you might not be DPR and/or unaware that SR runs there, etc. So little things like that where the judge tried to cast things in black and white hurt the defense. But she does have to decide whether or not something is admissable, and I think she had fun choosing the option that the server was admissable, even though how it was found as a story was implausible, but maybe possible.
I wonder how different the trial would have been if it had been traced to someone like a Bulgarian? Or if the server had been in San Francisco, USA?

Hmm. Bitcoin is programmable money, so it might be possible that the pay to script hashes could have a rule that the pay out has to send a percentage back to some earlier address before it can pay forward to other arbitrary addresses, but then to make sure those too have a similar hash scheme?

1. For me it solves the problem of accepting credit cards from Brazil. I can now sell things to a Brazilian and if they pay in cryptocurrency (bitcoin would be the easiest for me) then we can make a trade. I can sell hosting, VPN, etc, no worries about chargeback.
2. Money is already like this. Things might have been simpler for people back in the days of gold and silver money. You could in theory go panning for gold if you wanted money and no one could stop you trying. 
3. Your choice, I don't think it will be that bad. As they spend, they have to spend wisely on things that will earn them money back or else it's gone forever from their grasp. In the current system, they can print new money to keep their cronies afloat. I don't like the current society where well-connected banks got to stay afloat rather than suffer the chaos (o noe) of going out of business and being broken up. The current system is like flipping a coin in a rigged game: "heads I win, tails you lose".
4. I think the scaling part is maybe not as hard to achieve as people are imagining. Pretend bitcoin didn't change a single line of code - how would it scale right now? It would have to scale offline. People would have to be using side systems to pass around notional IOUs for bitcoin but settle once in a while on the blockchain. The current system could handle a person settling something out about 2 times a month, on a planet where more than half participate. So what you can do is cryptographically lock up some coins in escrow with other groups, and built up a circuit. That's what Lightning Network proposes. What I like about their proposal is that the worse case scenario - uses bitcoin through and through - but does it by holding back valid bitcoin messages which - if you want the circuit to close you go ahead and transmit to the network, but if you want the circuit to stay open, you can keep sending counter-proposals along. It's different from ChangeTip - changetip is a centralized IOU system, it's different from sidechains - Lightning stays bitcoin the whole time. And I think it could work.
5. This would take forever to address, but I don't like government manipulating the economy.

Sometimes I think these scams or swindles can make money if bitcoin's price goes up, but not as well as if people had just bought bitcoin directly. But if bitcoin's price crashes, the scam falls apart for lack of funds and everyone is wiped out. So, kind of a shady business.

And even better, the problem is cut purely in half. In that each side, the on-ramp and the off-ramp, only has to solve their side of it and they're done - worldwide.
So the Hong Kong side in this case just had to solved the on-ramp of selling bitcoins to people for Hong Kong dollars. And the off-ramp Rebit side had to solve the problem of buying those bitcoins and paying out in Philippine Pesos.
If they work together, it can be smoother, and they can make a fairly watertight relationship, but they didn't absolutely have to work together. They just made it seamless so that they could each benefit and keep it simple for customers.

No, the price won't stabilize for an extremely long time and maybe never. 
Gold is a very volatile asset, a huge store of value, market value of gold ETFs is way higher than bitcoins' and so I don't think bitcoin's price would be stable, even if it hypothetically surpassed gold's entire market value.
And, yes, kind of, blockchain tech will make it easier to store contracts for value so that you could buy or speculate on the value of a basket of goods (you'd have to be a little bit careful of how that got defined, but sure). But the amount of bitcoin needed to track that might be very small. Something like 0.0001 bitcoin just to track a contract and be able to make easy changes and flow it around, or a satoshi if you don't need to move it around or ever get the bitcoin back, eg 'read-only', but you'd have to pay fees anyway to make those changes, so might as well pay a bit more than the fees to hold such a thing, just so you could have the raw bitcoin back for other purposes...  
My personal bet is that a lot of bitcoin's value will be in B2B where manufacturers and buyers can more easily settle prices internationally and it will make sense someday for big companies to have a float of 1 to 10 BTC just to handle the comings and goings of their invoices and payments. It will be normal. Somewhat like needing a few IP addresses just to have a web site, a mail server. You can make systems which use IP addresses extremely efficiently, but when you do you add complexity and maybe some businesses would actually save money by just buying larger quantities of IPs or even whole public networks /27 or /24 in size.  I think that having a footprint of bitcoin on the blockchain will be like that: settling international transactions will be 'doable' with a small amount of bitcoin as waste, but way easier if you have a bigger float.

I'm not aware of huge VC investment in the opportunities for communications that HAM radio could enable. Maybe there's something cool and innovative and global that you could do with shortwave radio. But you don't see the investment there the way you do with solar panels, electric cars, rockets (SpaceX etc), and bitcoin.
Bitcoin industries might also wind up being like the railroads in that it could go big, and people could make speculative fortunes, and/or be totally wiped out by scams and hucksters, while at the same time taking a while to affect society, being loved and hated, and making only a few people very rich.

There will constantly be more altcoins created - sometimes those will do something useful and stick around, or they'll have community groups and supporters that will put the effort in, but a lot will deflate and be sold to buy bitcoin.
I agree with the others, ways to make bitcoin more anonymous will come...
Ways to make bitcoin fast enough to handle the world's currencies will probably be set up so that participants will lock up in a form of escrow a big chunk of bitcoin with other market participants, who will then make a mesh of payments. Those payments will happen off-blockchain but would be redeemable and get settled out on a slower time frame - like a batch - so that about once a month or so, you'll re-setup your payments to people, re-escrow some coins, but from then on have fast settlement over a bitcoin-escrowed 'circuit'.  So all of those transactions would be happening off blockchain and somewhat hard to really figure out who paid who and get you back more of the pseudo privacy first envisioned. And if that doesn't turn out to be enough privacy, coins that use "Moon Maths" (really difficult to understand mathematics, like zero knowledge proofs and ring signatures) will push coin values around and if you trust that and they work, you'll be able to mix and obfuscate and keep your privacy intact.
I think bitcoin would go further if people believed that they truly had a right to financial privacy, but governments generally don't think that people have the right to financial privacy - they want taxes on income and payments etc (for now).
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:59:51
It's okay, bitcoin's reward system is not based on altruism.
But this gives people a reason to feel optimistic that scaling can happen. Bitcoin's decentralized nature will never be as able as a centralized system to be inexpensive and low on resources, since we're keeping copies all over the place ;)
But to see that some of the hardest problems for nodes to deal with the bitcoin blockchain and it's transactions - CPU (processing), memory (working memory), disk space (storage), network bandwidth (transmission), 
-- this one is Personal Area Network-scale network bandwidth, and it's probably a sending but not receiving oriented medium - like satellites are to nationwide coverage...
Anyway, love seeing these advances, they do help...
Side note, I am not so sure that all the Game Theory of scaling bitcoin up is worked out, the fork problem of old and new value and so on, but maybe...

I kind of want them to waste time on altcoin schemes like that until it's too late to do anything but fight or join bitcoin. I can somewhat imagine a future where bitcoin and a few alts with important characteristics slurp a lot of the world's value which is in currency into them. Then watching banks struggle to buy reserves of bitcoins will be amusing as hell. First central bank to get a reserve of a few million bitcoins "wins".

@_date: 2017-07-15 21:29:59
Yes looks great.
A more advanced version of it is that the block they mine has a bunch of valid transactions they will mine too (or not) - and the first transaction and the most important one to the miners is the coinbase transaction that pays to the pool. So if you find the winning number as a pooled miner, you are forced to pay the pool and get your payout that way. If you find the lucky number, you don't have a choice to give yourself all the bitcoin. You could withhold attack though.
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:24:08

Sounds great.
She could pay a big mining pool to give their transactions some priority. Say the mining pool is 25% of the hash rate of bitcoin, then about once every 40 minutes their transactions get mined. She could do the math on the chance that they won't find anything for a day. She could pay a private miners fee for this kind of priority.
I think she could use bitcoin as-is for this purpose, colored coins and all, and that would work fine. She doesn't need to kick anyone off or force anyone in, it would just exist along with everything else that's out there.

At your work get into a 401(k) or 403(b) and take any matching funds from your employer. Many employers work with Fidelity, Vanguard etc. Look for a no-fee index fund for the basics.
If you have extra money after that, some workplaces will steer you towards putting the extra into your workplace IRA. 
I would steer away from that though. If you're young enough, you can get stuck where all your investments wind up tax-defferred but not very liquid. (That's like my problem).
So if you have your retirement covered, you can go somewhere like Scottrade and buy stocks speculatively. It's really easy, you just load it with money from your bank account and then after that clears you can buy stocks. 
Oh, slightly beware taxes: don't buy and sell super rapidly and get lots of short term capital gains all over you. You want to hold these stocks for like a year or longer. Don't sell quickly.

It's like if you got your puppy kidnapped and the ransom note said to leave canned mackerel in a sack. You'd be like ... uh, is canned mackerel currency? And ... it turns out it is, to people in prison ... hmm Today I Learned (tm)
Overall I think it's bad for bitcoin. It's a poor way to introduce people to it. Illegal how these hackers hurt people, and immoral to celebrate any rise in bitcoin value from this.
In the long run, I do have hope that bitcoin will be seen as a payment and value storage system, so overall, very long run maybe okay. Like when you judge gold as valuable, it doesn't mean you believe the Conquistadors were justified.

Yeah I'd like privacy, something that can scale up fairly well, and it would be interesting if there was a maths trick to build up blocks in a blink of an eye so that confirmations were basically instant and things would settle out over the next few hours becoming more and more effectively irreversible.

Do you think they could have done it differently, like ....
We're looking for _Partners_ to make an ETF.
I wonder if it would've helped if they'd make it more clear that there are profit opportunities in this, including controlling interests in it, if people want to take the initiative on this.
And maybe get a chain of them going .... like;
1) I'll make the ETF if someone at NASDAQ or NYSE can list public stock in an American bitcoin Exchange
2) I'll make an American bitcoin Exchange, sell out to VC insiders, and take it public ...
3) I'll list it, but I need regulations
4) I'll write the regulations ....
Blah blah blah, it's just such a Wall Street circlejerk of rules and some important people are not able to see how they get paid a chunk of the profits. 
So I think it's somewhat stalling for those kinds of social reasons. It's like the other big players (banks etc) are like: "What's in it for me to help you? If I delay, it gets worse for you and better for me...."

The Internet was closed to the public for a long time. Arpanet was a military / university system. Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale sent emails to each other to plan their 1980 reelection campaign. President Carter could send email from Air Force Once back in the day. Did you have anything comparable? Maybe a home built IMSAI 8080 PC (first available 1975), 300 baud modem? There were a lot of enthusiasts doing cool things and connecting to bulletin boards, but it was still going to be a while until the public used email.
(In the meantime, mimeographs and fax machines still being used ....)
When did you send your first email? I think my first email was 1992 on a VAX. Ironically, Eternal September started September 1993, just a year after I got email ;) so the floodgates were open forever then.

Not a bad cryptocurrency oriented security standard. I've done work with ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53. I think a lot of these businesses could use either of those two as a background for system and organizational standards and maybe add in yours as a kind of best practices when handling cryptocurrencies.
* offline or logically separate identity records and disclosure of those only to relevant governments, etc. Compartmentalizing them by country or year, or activity level, etc. 
* keep European user information in a server in Europe, keep USA user information in a server in the USA (encrypted offline backups could be elsewhere potentially in case of an outage/seizure).
* multifactor access to accounts at exchanges (yubikey U2F SMS text page to confirm etc)
* lack of identity info tied literally to your account in an 'about page' etc
* same for whatever banking info you connect, in case the account is compromised dont let someone drain out your bank
* api key limitations (read only, trading okay, withdrawls okay or not)
* key blocks on activities (exporting out money, bitcoins, needing a confirmation - to email, to phone, somewhere separate)
* clearly written policies
* where possible, clear and understandable architectures
* insurance issues beyond proof of reserve
* when accounts are blocked - who can users appeal to? (if its blocked by the US government and they want it to be 'super secret pinky swear' - not how do we work around this, but how is a person supposed to lawyer up and get their money?)
* clear ownership  - identities pictures names and backgrounds of key officers of the company - fine if they want to be anonymous, but let's be clear about who is who
* separation of compliance role from any role in actual processing (compliance is about rules and seeing that they are followed, and not about helping to handle larger sums)
* clear terms which, if mentioned (and can not necessarily ever be complete), will have your account suspended or closed (eg if you type in 'this is for drugs' if you are asked why you are buying) -- immediate suspension, immediate closure of account, and/or review, refund of money/bitcoins etc -- should you mention it in a chat window to a helpdesk person - then per Rule 6, mentioning forbidden things, BOOM, account suspended, refunded; don't leave us guessing what these rules are
* publish the list of people you can't work with -- or at least let us know some kind of ticket # and someone that can be appealed to - even if you can't tell us anything - give us something that we can give someone in officialdom (my brother has a really common Irish name and it took him a long time to get off the No Fly list which he was put on by accident, ugh, he's obviously got the same name of someone wanted).

Also, I don't know if someone like nobodybelievesyou would be interested and maybe agree to add their views, but it seems like the cryptocurrency space needs more people that are able to do things like - when they post numbers (units sold, transactions, profitability, number of customers) - that they post those up publicly and hopefully understand that we won't like see those kinds of claims walked back, buried, or hidden later.
Kind of like the bitcoin obituary, someone needs a bitcoin claims page. If someone walks out a claim that they have 10,000 customers, and then they revise that to mean users, wallets, page views or other metrics, you start to feel like they have a sham going on or something lazy is happening, even if it's not outright shady.
You might be trying to aim this at technology but sometimes the issues aren't so much a checklist of items but a larger thing, a way that companies need to watch over the smallest details with an incredibly fine eye, as well as keep up with top notch ethics, and if business goes south, an exit plan that was communicated up front if they are going to pull the ripcord and bail.

There's also a good argument that the Saudis are not only pumping oil for foreign policy reasons, but because they see the writing on the wall when it comes to oil -- places like Scotland got 100% of their winter power last year from their own wind farm.

@_date: 2017-05-27 04:23:15
Heh, I will write you a novel:
Well if you know for a near certainty that something will go up in value, then you want to go "all in". (Whatever that is, it's not bitcoin, bitcoin goes wildly up and down).
But if the risk of loss is kind of high, and whether the price today is too high or too low, you can even out your risks by buying over time. 
The price of bitcoin probably just peaked, and now we get a long slide down to $2000 or maybe $1500. I'm not a LONG time holder of bitcoin like some, but I've been through this rodeo a couple times.
So don't over do it, just when you think you should buy, that's probably the worst time to buy. You've heard of it, you get those fear of missing out feelings (FOMO), and then you have to learn how to relax into that fear (and greed) and just RELAX. 
Go slow, invest slow, and remember that there are opportunities like bitcoin ALL AROUND YOU. 
I should also say: 95% of the stuff that looks like maybe a good investment is a big scam. So watch out for scammers. Most people live very sheltered investment lives, but in cryptocurrencies, probably 90+% of the altcoins are scams and it's really really hard for some people to tell up from down, once you get on some circlejerk forums. So like OneCoin or ... whatever. Also cryptos have a way of blowing up in value in such a way that people that are scamming wind up coming up short all the time - like the Dogecoin tipbot guy Moolah, or absconding with the money like that Cyprus bank thing, or PayCoin or whatever. Shit that people pull with normal dollars doesn't fly when cryptos skyrocket in value and then they can't cover the made up IOUs they give you in exchange for your coins. In the ordinary world of business, they might have been successful with tactics they learned from others - tactics that they think will work because they get away with it (and so do others) in the ordinary business world. But in crypto, you have to be honest and transparent to a fault (also, EXTREMELY competent), or you will get chewed up and spat out. Very hard business to be in.
(Businesses like Shapeshift.io seem to keep their wits about them pretty well, and the moves of crypto through them are in and out, so there's a chance always of a hacker, and they do publish publicly each trade so don't hope for secrecy, but depending on the kinds of risks you are watching out for, they are great.)
So watch out, don't get too cynical, but keep a sharp lookout.
Oh YES - if you buy bitcoin - that is already a MASSIVE RISK -- try and stay sane and see if you can stop yourself from "investing" your bitcoin into other things. The greed will get you. Example: you could lend your bitcoin out for shorting on bitfinex -- you could make something like 20-25% interest a year off that! Wow you think - let's do it! Next think you know bitfinex is hacked. Bitcoin gone, replaced with IOUs. Ugh. Not to slam bitfinex, but it's just an example. In those rates of return is the implied risk of losing it all. You don't get high returns like that without high risk, sorry.
Okay, real last thing. Bitcoin (and other cryptos to some degree) is MONEY. Emotions are sky high. So take investing in it not solely as a cool speculation that could pay off big, but also maybe a chance to feel your emotions but not let them get the better of you.
Oh ALSO - as you transfer money onto an exchange to buy bitcoin, you are at risk of having some bank or a scammer at the exchange maybe - decide that you are a financial risk and freeze your money.  So if you transfer the full $32k to an exchange to buy, you might find that they've taken your money, made up a Know Your Customer (KYC) reason as an excuse, but maybe(???) just flat out stolen it from you without recourse. The shit is Wild West, and Fly by Night. You have to keep your wits about you. You have never never surely been around this level of shenanigans :)
(All that said, you could make a fortune too)

Kind of; incredibly efficient SHA256 mining. Or, if they over-optimize it, vast advances in preimage attacks, or variations on a theme...
I would have started to suspect that bitcoin mining was a preimage attack making system if the bitcoin alert system or something like it could be used to send something around that says: here's a hash, try to get the end or the beginning digits 'close' (maybe close enough to fool a human eye that's skimming the first and the last digits)
But anyway, no, bitcoin is more like a vast timestamping system, and/or a communications system, where by brute force the strongest (fastest) hashers get to decide what transactions process. Kind of cool, it's like a way to communicate and keep up system integrity in the face of many transactions.
Totally different than things like an atomic SQL update. Maybe compare it conceptually to that. It's amazing.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:04:01
Yes, well to us in bitcoin-land, it's more obvious that they can literally create money out of thin air so if banks go bankrupt it's because they were not friends of the Fed and broke whatever rules the Fed made up for legalized fractional reserve banking. ;) So why not wait until a bankruptcy? But the game goes on, so they have this confidence game where we get to feel confident that banks can pass a stress test etc. This will somehow identify banks with bad loans. Etc. ;)
Yeah, well that might be because the US and the Swiss both signed up to Basel III so they might have been hoping that these reserves would be in place, so they had to make up USD dollar numbers and transfer it over to member banks to make them have enough dollars on the balance sheets to meet the made up new goalposts.

I think bitcoin is now safely past the point where a billionaire could, as a pastime, just go and destroy bitcoin.
At this point, you're talking the level of nation states power to destroy bitcoin.
Obviously a crypto could survive "underground" use trusted nodes and trusted miners, encryption, and look like harmless traffic via steganography, so resist nearly indefinitely.
But open bitcoin, would require a huge commitment to destruction.
At the nation state level, it would be easier to outlaw bitcoin and just send police to chase people down. Might in the end cost just about the same amount of money but is easier to do with a goon squad than with a bunch of mathematics, IC fabs, and brains.

If the only taxes you had to pay were real estate taxes, they would be damn hard to 'evade' without losing ownership of your property.
And you can from then on ignore the privacy implications of income tax, the regressiveness of sales taxes, luxury taxes, estate taxes, and you don't have to track US citizens taxes around the world with FACTA etc, and all of this money laundering that is related to income or capital gains tax evasion hoo-hah could go away.
Essentially, if you did not own real estate in the US, then you would not have to pay taxes (directly). You would pay indirectly of course, but only really if you lived in the US and/or really indirectly if you buy products from the US.

Well, they are doing different things.
If you had a marketplace, it would be less wasteful to have one store to buy things at, one warehouse to store items in, one farm to grow crops, one mine to mine ore, etc. 
Since the real world is spread out and has many people in it, these separate actors have an economy, a marketplace, which reflects that. Currently with laws, customs, contracts, reputation, capital, and so on, they (we) have all built this amazing global system. But we could do more if for pushing money around, we could transfer value without so much trust. Probably still need a reputation system (and stores, and farms, and markets, and mines, and so on).
The world is distributed, and bitcoin's design works in that world without the need for a central mediator, so it's only 'wasteful' because we can't trust a significant percentage of humanity (not the majority of humanity though, or else we would be hosed - if most hashing power goes to scammers, it's probably over)

The others have answered really well, and I will add another tidbit
The payout of the coinbase transactions (12.5 btc + fees) can go to one address or be a bunch of payouts to a lot of addresses
When a miner is desperately hashing away looking for that payout, usually a pool gives them a whole transaction to mine (so where it pays out to is fixed).
That means that if you're the lucky miner in a larger pool of miners, you can't just pay yourself. The hash you found is only really going to be valid for the payout structure (like paying to one address or many) that was already fixed when you started hashing your range of numbers to try.
You could hypothetically 'attack' the pool you are mining in by not broadcasting a winning transaction. But meh.

@_date: 2015-02-05 19:31:09
When the miner mines a block, in the coinbase transaction (50 BTC initial value) they set which addresses they want to send the rewards to in advance.
A solo miner could set it to send to the same address every time, or a new address each time. Pools can send different amounts to different members. They can do silly stuff like send a single satoshi to a 'counter' or 'odometer' like address that totals how many blocks they've found, etc :)

But if it took their stupid attempt to sink bitcoin and sunk them, and it was possible for us to reverse back out of it after they waste a fortune trying to sink bitcoin.
Then it would be worth it.
Like say they spent a few billion to try and kill things off, and we come up with a simple system to trash their investment.

From the other side of the fence, from a banker's point of view, that's the *best* thing about fiat money.
If someone loses some money, you have choices. You can be best friends of a Central Bank and get topped up and use the money to go on a buying spree, or you can gang up on someone you don't like and let them go out of business when they make mistakes, like insuring your AAA rated junk mortgage bonds.

Data stored on a hard drive that's encrypted before it gets to the drive might have a chance of staying secure. 
The firmware could read file formats like NTFS, ext2/ext3, and could tell if particular drivers needed to be swapped out and replaced with it's own Trojaned versions. Yikes.
But I think that having these dodgy drives on network fileservers that are saving encrypted files to and from other computers on the network (would have to think about the threat a little bit - needs to be encrypted but also make it so that the file is not fingerprinted - to make sure the controller doing the read/write, can't really tell what it's reading and writing)

20x is a hypothetical where someone who thinks bitcoin is definitely going upwards borrows bitcoins (and pays to borrow those coins), and hopes to recoup that at a later date.
But if bitcoin's price goes against them, they could get margin called. And the higher your leverage the more likely you are to get margin called by small negative price moves (noise) or a cascade of lower prices.
That's where you pay ongoing fees to borrow bitcoin from someone else, and you use leverage to get the benefits of larger gains if bitcoins price goes up. If it goes against you, you get margin called.
Here they're talking about lower leverage, maybe 2 to 1 or 4 to 1, in a real exchange. And a margin call for a long time customer could be literally a phone call or an email asking you to deposit more money or else they have to close your positions. 
But on a bitcoin exchange, you can get bigger margins, and they just close you if you don't have enough to cover it. And it can all happen in a flash.

I think they mean - claim the server as yours (makes you claim to be DPR by some interpretations) - and then gain 4th amendment protection against search and seizure, evidence fruit of the poison tree, and then inadmissable, case falls apart.
Fantasy though, the judge wanted this guy nailed. No choices.
If they'd gone that route, judge would have ruled it admissable anyway, overruled the 4th amendment by saying 'server is in Iceland, how would 4th apply?' and then slamdunked being DPR.
She's just power tripping since DPR was cornered. And taking a little bit of delight at having such a high profile case before her. 
Like Judge Lance Ito in the OJ Simpson case, it's your chance to become famous, maybe become a Supreme Court Justice someday! You need some famous cases to build you up.

@_date: 2019-05-10 19:20:33
Well if there's no AML/KYC on it for those amounts, maybe you now own some anonymous bitcoin. That's not all bad. Maybe that was a bit steep on the fees. But if you need anonymity, it's priceless.
$1300 is cheap for FOMO. Some people really go crazy. As long as it's not money you need within the next 1-3 years, you're fine.
I had my own FOMO moments, everyone does. Once you're on the bitcoin rollercoaster for a while, like 2-3 years in, you chill and no longer FOMO. But maybe you find other behaviors that grab you.
Mine is usually when I am increasing the security of my holdings, that's when I should sell instead. That's my own personal quirk I've learned about. But I can't seem to change it ;)
I think another typical thing that happens is 3+ months in, you start to wonder if you should trade to get more bitcoin. I did, it did not work out, I wasn't massively unlucky, but taxes would be simpler and I'd have slightly more if I'd never traded.
A bad level to get to is to take the big risk of bitcoin (going to zero) and adding onto that risk by trying to lend it, getting involved in bitcoin lending - or getting sucked into ponzi's like bitconnect.
Another level of that is trying to buy into pie in the sky cloud mining dreams.
But all these things a person discovers for themselves.
Always do experiments with small amounts, not whole balances / whole wallets.
Also never go full fiat.

Does it use Ring signatures from a bunch of mixers and the users themselves to do transactions?
Like A sends to B, but C D E F G are also all out there, and ready to join anyone's ring? And there's some kind of mixing up service of ring signatures to make a confusion out of transactions?
I assume wallets sit around co-signing ring signatures all the time so that your own signature on your own transactions is less than 1% or far less, 1/10th of a percent? Of the transactions so that you can't really be tied to any one without the signal disappearing into the noise?

You don't but each nation state loves controlling the labor / drones / rivals / etc of their own nation. Kind of like how farmers own cattle.
So this captive group, each nation state, more or less, wants to keep them as their personal market to sell things to, a convenient and trapped labor supply, etc.
So what nation states will do is band together and just ask that each downlink station register a country and have the hardware, like GPS, know where it is, and set a country code for which country it's in, and then ask that they use a locally licensed ISP as the ground station. 
That ground station, it goes without saying, would enforce the Great Firewall of that country.
That's how nation states think.

And second order things, like what do other people think makes good money?
Depending on the time and place, you might use seashells, cattle, gold, etc as money, depends.
The time is now though, the Internet is here, and bitcoin will probably be the winner. (I think there are other cryptos that are a bit better). 
But it's best enough, and if enough other people feel that way, then we're rewarded for making the right crowd-informed choice.

It will be possible to have a terabyte sized card for your phone, so you'll be able to have a node, but it might be a bit of a private node, where you don't fully participate sharing blocks with others.
It's hard to know how good the phone network will be, but probably the network bandwidth could be high.
But if you sync up the chain on like a PC with a better network, then once you have a copy of the blockchain on an SD card, then you can download new blocks to your phone (they're small, just a few megs and come every 10 or so minutes).
But a phone is not going to be a miner in the current proof of work system.
If we had a proof of stake system (something I DON'T want for bitcoin), then a phone could be a staker since it takes very little resources for that kind of system to work. That leads to a new problem, I can stake and shill a million coins. Why would anyone want any of those coins. The effect of a mined coin is polarizing (besides merge mining), in general you have to pick one or another coin to spend electricity mining.

Well bitcoin itself doesn't really censor who can use it. So he's free to go buy bitcoin somewhere like localbitcoins, Kraken, etc.

Since I don't know what you're driving at....
But we are in a subreddit...
Pretend that messages can be written basically immutably into the blockchain, if they're old enough, buried under enough work. There's nothing about the messages semantic meaning that has to be "true" to get into the blockchain, it just has to be syntactically true.
So by that I mean, I could post something that's not "true" like "Nixon shot Kennedy", but I could craft a valid message that would pass muster and I could save the message "Nixon shot Kennedy" into the blockchain.
So ultimately, Truth is something we all agree to agree on. One side can choose to be an asshat though and deliberately misrepresent or badly lie about what is or isn't true, even if you record it into a blockchain..
So next, if you already have a ledger where you can't join unless you get permission, you don't need Proof of Work, you just need non-repudiation, and some central group that's controlling who can get in, and those who choose to be members can keep their own copy if they like, but obviously if the central system decides to retroactively change what is recorded, and others in the system go along with the lies, then what good does knowing the truth do you?
Anyway... hope you liked the reply?

I personally think the Tor-chat-whatever logs going back years sounded pretty damning. 
But something I am curious about --
Did Ross Ulbricht live like a king or was he living on ramen noodles? 
That is, is it plausible that he sold Silk Road a long time ago, lived off of some sale amount, like 10K bitcoin, and then really did take the site back later?
Did he know personally the other DPR? If not, how would his Tor chat logs whatever have the conversation(s) of the other alleged owner(s)?
Probably will be found guilty regardless, ah well.

Randal Schwartz - is the the one that wrote perl, but got reamed by his employer, Intel, because he was embarrassing them with their bad passwords?
He shouldn't have touched their yucky badly passworded systems, and also not installed his own gateway/VPN to intel's networks... unless he was hired as a Security Engineer and what he was doing was in the scope of the work hired and he had the get out of jail free card. I've learned over the years not to shame people into doing security, that kind of tactic is for someone burning bridges on their way out (and maybe straight to a lawsuit).

I think the IMF lets them borrow so that they can pay back foreign banks, and then get deeper and deeper into debt.
Until they are forced to sell off things that belong to the state.
I think Greece was forced to sell ports and airports (yikes), and also odd things like state-owned amusement parks (!!???!! - I admit, I need to find the source on that).
So I don't approve of these foreign banks driving countries into the dirt. 
And it's dumb of these countries to take the loans in a foreign currency, and then to debase their own home currency.
It's just dumb all around.

Well what we're going to do, at some point, is basically require real valuable bitcoins to be actually staked somehow. Probably via LN, and then they can make all the pretend loans in shadow dollars they want to. To actually have bitcoin, that will be a different thing.
It's all going to be fine. Everything about the system makes you want more bitcoin and for that bitcoin to be more valuable.
Trading groups just want the price to oscillate around randomly so they can make money off sales buys and sells, or bets long and short. Holders want it to go long, and haters want to see it die.
We'll see how it turns out.

Yeah well I agree with what you're saying. Being early doesn't give you some super wisdom. Just pointing out that early bitcoiners (with experience) have some odd views sometimes. And so you kind of have to pick through the bits and find and support those parts of it that support what you think bitcoin is. It's a bit of game theory too because ... what does everyone else think bitcoin is or should be? I think smaller blocks are a bad idea. I am fine with slightly bigger blocks. 
I think the idea of a little programming language for their smart contracts might be okay (is it just a layer over the standard bitcoin language?)
I think the idea of some intriguing hard forks where you add in new OP_ codes to put in brand new kinds of very simple transactions could be cool.
But that wasn't on the list. Eh, oh well. Not willing to learn github and pull code to be involved, so I guess I have to let people like Luke-Jr be my proxy and I'll just support the things that come close to what I think bitcoin should be, and say something when I think it's not.

Why would veriblock spam bother you any more than LN anchoring transactions.
I mean if someone wants to commit a daily hash to the blockchain to anchor down all the real estate transactions in Italy, I'm not complaining.
That's the entire fucking point of bitcoin - a permissionless distributed notary timestamp service that is very hard to tamper with.
We can use it for money, we can use it to anchor some token chains or altcoins, we can store hashes of cat videos, whatever.
No one needs anyone's permission to use it this way. Using the blockchain is the entire point that drives the value.

He can make analogies all he likes, but I don't think it's the same thing as his analogy right now. Yes clearly 1GB sized blocks would be too much. But what is the right size for a simple size increase?
The hard part is not the blocksize and the ideal size or the algorithm to increase or decrease it. It's how you game theory out the smallblockers vs the any larger size blockers, and how attacks and double spends can be done when you're near the 50/50 split in hashpower support.

Yeah the wounds that Etherium self-inflicted kind of put a bit of a shadow even on bitcoin. I think we're all pretty rock solid about the block reward halving, 21 million coins max, etc, but it makes you wonder if the openness of the ledger isn't a problem, because it lets you identify wallet balances -- and if people can spot these balances, then the jealous mob gets out it's pitchforks and then mob mentality sets in and a tyrrany of the majority forks the coin to see justice done, etc. When really I think, well I hope, that bitcoin eventually gets some tech that gives us secret address balances and some kind of automatic mixing. I bet bitcoin could change to accommodate that. I'm not concern trolling bitcoin, I have lets say quite a balance in bitcoin, enough that I don't want to see the value wiped out. And I'd rather have secret balances more than smart contracts.

"intrinsic value" means whatever people who believe in that concept want it to believe. They think that gold for example has intrinsic value. It's a point of view they choose to hold.
Example - you are stranded in the desert, you can have gold or water. You are falling in an airplane, you can have a parachute or a bar of gold. You are having gold seized, or an asteroid full of gold is mined and the price of gold falls through the floor. 
There are all kinds of scenarios where intrinsic value falls apart. Most bitcoiners believe in Austrian economics which is different. Example, this article: 
But anyway, taking gold as an example, gold specifically is just one of those things which has, overall, some good properties as money, and people who chose to store value in it (by taking it in trade) were rewarded. So it has some history.

You can borrow bitcoin to amplify your gains (in bitcoin) if it goes up. Or amplify your losses and get margin called.
Same thing, you can short bitcoin, or lend to people doing shorts. If bitcoin price moves against you, you get margin called.
Watching the price wobble around, I think it's just the market tossing around trying to get people to chase the price until they run out of steam. 
One side or the other will run out (Bulls or bears) and then the price can either fly higher or crash. etc.

I remember back when slashdot had an article as bitcoin crossed the $1 parity.

And about 90% of the sentiment there is still smugly out in techno left field thinking they've won.
They've really been given yet another chance to buy in.
I wonder if any of them realize that like 5 years ago, they could have had bitcoin for ~$500. Today it's just above 3000, so 500% gains in 5 years.

Oh .... Craig asserts ownership over some wallets, probably so he can claim to be Satoshi, and get loans out against the value at these addresses ... which addresses? Wait, they're not his?

"  all the documents that made specific testable claims as to owning  bitcoins were relatively easy to debunk as simple backdated forgeries  (possibly for use in Wright's alleged tax fraud schemes).

I guess the SEC can go after whoever they want if they think it's actually a security but I dont think anyone was selling the company to people that rented hashpower. 
And it would be the FTC if it's actually a scam ... maybe the FBI if its "wire fraud" (pretty much anything involving a computer over a network), and Federal if it goes over state lines.
Cases can make precedent if they're relevant. If GAW said hashes were giving you a security in the company (or a wink and a nod insinuation of that) then sure that would drag in the SEC. And the SEC can chase whatever they want to. Good that they got GAW I guess? 
Funny thing though, different subject than hash mining, there's a car club in my area where I can rent a Lambo. Doesn't mean the SEC needs to get involved though. No one is selling me the company.
Anyone want to go chase obvious superscams like OneCoin? Seems like bigger fish. (Though GAW was bad and should be chased down.)

XRP was created to fund the company “*Ripple*”, they own about 60% of all XRP
XRP came before the ICO craze
Whenever Ripple feels they could use a little cash, they can dump on you. They can also not dump on you whenever they want to do the opposite of the rest of the market and be a "good deal" so, the will sometimes not dump in order to be the only green light in a sea of red. This creates fanboys who are actually just cattle waiting for a day of slaughter. Well if Ripple is nice to them, sheep to be sheared.

No, I'm against a decrease. This is just silly. The size and transmission of the blockchain is not a huge problem. I don't care that it takes a month to sync and 20+ gigs.
I hope they can spend time on something more real like can we have a more anonymous base layer of bitcoin.
The downside is that LN is going to take some of the privacy pressure off because people can just sit in a channel and make purchases. I like LN, but that's a downside (to me).
I think blocks should remain big and if anything we should figure out how to add mandatory zero knowledge proofs to the base layer so that the pseudonymity goes away and we have an anonymous bitcoin blockchain where no one knows who has sent how much to whom, or who has received anything, and there's jack shit that chain analysis overlords can do about it. That's not helped by SMALLER blocks, because zkSNARKS are apparently kind of large. 
So I don't see myself ever supporting smaller blocks.

Game theory: it's in Coinbase's best interests to FUD about bitcoin in order to be able to list more shitcoins. Shitcoins (hot cheap alts) provide them with trading riches.
Counter theory from bitcoin believers: get your coins off of exchanges. Get them out, do not lend them, do not let shorters borrow them, stop feeding the Beast. Get your coins out and if we all do it and not let our coins be for sale, then there is no supply and prices go up. Only sell if you have to. Lock out the non-believers and the nocoiners and the cynics and the shitcoins.

When the miner found a block, they added a little extra data to tell others what cool new bitcoin features they would like to see and share support with others on. (Support for a hard fork feature)
I would assume that this means the miner is signalling support for BIP109.
Looks like that miner supports Gavin Andreesen's 2MB block proposal. If enough people signal "Hey I would support this feature..." Then that tells you that the miners at least are on board.
Then the question, is the wider group of bitcoin holders, users, and prospective consumers interested? 
If it's not contentious, then people can safely hard fork to it. A hard fork is harder to do in a low impact way than a soft fork.
Hard forks add something that breaks the rules so to speak.
A soft fork you can do by choosing to be more strict and is easier to pull off maybe.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:44:28
Yeah it's really great.
It kind of proves that idea that you would need theoretically very very little bitcoin if it's just a payment system passing value around.
The real value is in a store of value, so if you have to have it stored in order to be able to use it for payments, like as an anchor for payments, then it gains the store of value.
It's like owning bitcoin can be equivalent conceptually to owning the cash in a cash register; businesses will need a base amount of bitcoin just to do business, like having a fax machine.
It's what I always envisioned :) maybe someday companies will have about a bitcoin staked out, each, just like they now have multifunction devices like printers/fax/networkshares devices.
Imagine every point of sale terminal having a decent amount of bitcoin in it (like maybe 1/20th of a bitcoin). And some more central ones with even more in a back room with better security (with about a full bitcoin in it).
Western Union has about a half million locations and I could easily imagine the bigger locations needing more than a bitcoin each in liquidity and the smaller ones with less, so just western union would need several thousands of bitcoin, on the order of what Coinbase has on the books today.
So ... if you want your bitcoin to be worth even more, you must take it offline and out of their hands, so that they have to buy real actual bitcoin to pull this off. If you leave your bitcoin at exchanges, they can become a major lightning node and take that value away from you.
Bizarrely, it's a win-win situation for them too if their own customers get their bitcoin and get out. Then the bitcoin they have is worth more.

1. I think the die hards in bitcoin:
censorship-resistant money, no quantitative easing.
2) bitcoiners who are also Austrian economists:
Example - what's so bad about QE? The economy suffers, let's print money.
What happens is malinvestment.
Broken window fallacy - spending money in the GDP is always good. Spending money to dig holes and fill holes.
Austrian view: all of that Keynesian stuff is shit and completely stupid.
2b) bitcoiners who are into technology
Maybe bitcoin is the next big thing in tech. Finance could use a change. Why are all of these middlemen necessary?
Maybe the bitcoin network could host smart contracts. Maybe we don't need lawyers or courts.
Maybe we could have computers pay computers.
Could a taxicab company own itself, buy autonomous cars, pay for gas, and grow, with no humans at the helm???
This is some cyberpunk stuff!
2c) bitcoiners into crypto (like me)
I love cryptography and I love seeing the uses it can be put to
2d) anarchists: bitcoin has no leader, demonstrates that we need no leader, survives because it has no leader. This is a good example of something they might like.
2e) meta: there is no one reason why people are into bitcoin. They might be into censorship resistant money so they can buy drugs, or whatever. That's not why I am into bitcoin.
3) my view regarding QE:
The businesses that you see all around you should have failed already, been sold off, and put to more productive uses.
4) my views regarding all of this, bitcoin, and where I think things should go:
We could put in place a 35 hour work week, then a 30, then a 25, then a 20. Etc.
(Also, eliminate income taxes, sales taxes and all other taxes. Put in place only a real estate tax - it's a long long story about why that's for the best)
Eventually things would balance out.

Counter-argument, it's a good way to maybe tell if someone is messing with your Internet and keep you from receiving a block over land lines.
Fundamentally they are switching out the media at layer 1, and I know they think they're swapping out layer 2 and 3 (LAN and Internet) but probably satellites are also MPLS switched just as the Internet actually is deep down.
(So I think their hopes that a satellite link would survive something like a SQL Slammer type UDP driven attack against the whole Internet is funny.)
But I think that smaller regional problems, like when a Pakistani ISP blacked out YouTube my mucking with BGP tables, that this satellite thing could be useful for that kind of scenario - some kind of basic circa 1 day regional outage of the Internet.

The reward for mining is the coinbase transaction (nothing to do with the company named Coinbase) - and that's the blockrward of 12.5 bitcoin - and miners also get as fees all the unaccounted for values that come in as inputs, then go out as outputs. They get the implict missing bitcoin as their fees.
The fees I think are usually a lot less than the coinbase. I wouldn't be surprised if the fees were about 1-5% of the block reward.
Sometimes when a new block comes out, it takes a second for a mining pool to figure out what to mine next. In the meantime, they mine something empty, just so the electricty/effort isn't wasted.
And it's not a waste, it buries under more work the previous block. So it makes them more secure.
It would be bad only if all the miners only mined empty blocks. But as long as some miners think it's worth mining for the fees that they can get, that's good.
We expect fees and not mining rewards alone to be an ever-rising part of the value of mining. But, we're not sure. We just hope it goes that way. It should?

Where the energy might be found, and where the energy can be used, are going to be in two different places.
If you are super lucky, they are right next to each other. But a lot of places on Earth, the power supply is in one place and the consumers in another.
To get power to where it needs to go, you need to either send it over power lines (hydro, solar, coal plants, natural gas plantes, nuclear plants), or ship it as chemical energy as solid, liquid or gas. (coal, gasoline, natural gas etc). 
Some sources of stranded power are hydro plants high in the mountains and no cities or UHV power lines to move the energy. Or you could have gas fields just flaring gas off into the atmosphere uselessly.
If you said - well, we should just not build hydro in the middle of nowhere, and not dig for natural gas just to have it flare off uselessly - YES - I agree. That is called malinvestment, and it needs to stop. 
If the damage is already done, or they intend, someday, to afford something better, or they want to defray the costs of a system that just naturally has too much power sometimes and would rather sell the spare capacity - like wind, hydro, etc, those are going to have times when they have too much. Well, now they can recoup their costs.

That's interesting. The Merkle Puzzle as early secret key exchange reminds me of Proof of Work. Just bury your opponents under so much work that the true parties can pick just one puzzle, solve that with less work, and then exchange information in a window of time until they opponent has solved about half of the flood of messages (maybe years later). Not great, but maybe good enough for something like battlefield communications.
Actually, on something like a submarine, you could use that early window of time to say something like 'Hey important message coming! Use one-time pad  - this is serious!' then use the OTP you have on the sub, for real, and then further communications would be basically noise the opponents couldnt read without a copy of the OTP.

Yep. --     (Unlike the article, I think it's just long and short positions and then failed breakouts or breakdowns.)
"The Bart Pattern comes as the latest in a long series of crypto trading-related memes. While the phenomenon is humorous in nature, the underlying implications of Bart are not so joyous. The pattern seems to be unique to cryptocurrency, and certainly does not represent what appears to be natural price movement. Many speculators have suggested that massive, regular surges and free falls are symptomatic of a larger problem – market manipulation by institutional investors. The logic behind this is that large accounts are moving the markets to coincide with their BTC derivatives on the CME and Cboe.
Of course, this is not the only explanation for the Bart Pattern. Another, perhaps more plausible explanation involves the role of leveraged crypto positions. As more and more traders seem to be placing both leveraged long and short positions on Bitcoin and other leading altcoins, each sizable price movement – both upward and downward – could be sparking a squeeze wherein a number of margin traders are liquidated, thus magnifying the initial movement.
Another theory suggests that, at a very pivotal moment such as in the wake of an imminent reversal, investors on both sides are very anxious to place their entries. Essentially, sidelined money is waiting for a breakout to re-enter markets. Without a shift in support to compensate for a full reversal, the next course of action is a correction of the failed breakout."
I think these just go until the market runs out of energy and then it either drops or soars.

The real danger is the scam that they might not actually have any mining equipment and (I dont know anything about this particular bitcoin mining group) - just like if you had a Yukon River Gold contract, and they sent you little bottles with gold flakes in them and then later a note that says "Welp, gold's all gone sir, on that stretch of the river, and with the technology we have to recover it with.

It's a database without a middleman running it, and while the transactions its recording could mean anything (movement of it's own bitcoin currency, small notes that people want to record onto the database, timestamps), attempts to undo a transaction or basically rewrite the accounting history, become exponentially more difficult to do. The rewards for the ones that organize and track the transactions in the database are more of the bitcoins issued.
So it solves the problem of having to maintain and trust centralized databases for things.
It does move the ball a little bit, now you have to trust the parties you interact with, because base level bitcoin is irrevocable in its movements, like cash, or like a bank wire is. Once you send, it's gone. But in that sense, bitcoin values are like money. 
On the other hand, there can be greater value than these intangible 1's and 0's that make up bitcoin, which is driven a lot by speculation, if you can imagine that the general database can encode other information, like you could use it to store stock certificate ownership, or register car tabs, or record land records on it, etc.
That said, someone could try to put false records into a blockchain too, but now you have to evaluate this information. It's ultimately no one thing to everybody, it's slightly different things depending on how you see it.

The bitcoin blockchain is essentially a record of broadcasts. 
99.999% of the transactions in the blockchain will not directly be to you, about you, or affect you.
The system has value because we don't all have to go to different coins to go find some base layer of timestamped valid transactions buried under proof of work. We can just use bitcoin.
So what I'm saying is that to YOU - 99.999% of the blockchain is already spam. 
You just need those records to be accurate, so if one day a transaction is about something you care about, that the ledger we all support still has those bitcoins in some UTXOs that you can send on and/or receive.
There's no way to make a nice global broadcast recording system like this and have it take predictable limited amounts of storage, without gating the way in with fees. If they pay the fee, they're in. If someone super rich wants to stuff the system with "trash" then we would have to pay more to make it usable at the base layer for our occasional use.
We will have to use second layer things to push around currency amounts and use bitcoin as a settlement system for only big important things. Not coffees.

Who would store data on a very expensive, very secure network? Well, you might just want a currency, or a timestamping network like Satoshi was thinking.
If you have the current distributed ledger, miners do admittedly have to store the blockchain, but what is it up to now? 
"Storage wise - because the block size is capped at 1 MB (and with 1 block approximately every ten minutes), this means that the blockchain can grow by at most 525,600 / 10 = 52,560 MB or ~ 52.5 GB per year (discounting leap year)."
That's just math. So without even looking I know by the age of bitcoin and the max size it could be, that it's far far under a terabyte. I will do a no-look guess and say it's smaller than 250 GB right now. That's kind of bit, maybe, I bet an install of Microsoft Office is bigger. Anyway.
Now who would want to store something (like in the OP_RETURN value? or just somehow embedded as a message?) - lots of people, obviously storage is huge. Having storage that people can't really erase is a cool thing. It's going to be super hard to tamper with the record keeping in bitcoin, it's getting exponentially more difficult to adjust the record and roll back blocks in the face of Proof of Work. Just 6 blocks in and you'd have to have major dedicated hashpower to undo it. 10 blocks in, you're probably not going to be able to roll back the record and embed "alternative facts" without hacking some bug in bitcoin itself. The Proof of Work to roll back that much is brutal. Might be easier to try to censor the Internet than roll back bitcoin. Or point guns at people and make them not regard whatever information was embedded in the blockchain - eg just outright steal like a thug. Like - if you used bitcoin to record title to property, it's so immutable that basically you can't really "undo" the old records. You could have later records added to the blockchain, that offer commentary, and that act as a kind of "correct the record", but the old records would still be out there...
So next, who would use an alternate blockchain where they could store more data for cheaper? Well, anyone. Once the Proof of Work is expensive enough to try and undo then those altcoins are kind of usable as a record keeping system too. They're not as universal as bitcoin ... they tend to be rough around the edges, they don't have the same community size as the grandaddy, but they're not useless for the purpose.
That said, these altcoins, they can just up and die on you. See: Shadowcash. I mean, WTF! So yes, if you're really trying to keep secure records *I* would stick with bitcoin. You don't have to convince me :) But I also like other coins for their features. Sometimes I get suckered into playing with altcoins that, on closer inspection, turn out to be not really better than bitcoin. But I like trying out alts before I decide. I usually have to have some before I make up my mind.
That rambling answer was an attempt to answer your question, I swear. :)
One last thought, the data you want to store on a blockchain (besides pushing inputs to outputs and treating it like currency alone) -- say you actually wanted to store DATA on the blockchain, then you have to either encode the data into your transaction, or have an external blob of data and something like a cryptographic hash and embed the hash in the blockchain. The actual data you're trying to store in a transaction can't be TOO SMALL, otherwise you wind up like Mooncoin that only gives you 7 bytes to store it in (and they do it by encoding it in the amount of Mooncoin you move around). That's not enough for an md5 / sha1 / sha2 (sha256) hash that would be way more useful. Not saying it's expensive, Mooncoin is cheap, it's just so tiny I'm not sure how useful it is. As an example altcoin. And in that implementation the character set seemed kind of limited. Like you couldn't store a Unicode message in Chinese in it really easily. Maybe they could change it though. All these coins are just digital and if people want to change them, they can. They can make new coins. It's a huge experiment :)

Yeah and I'm curious about the 100+GB blockchain ... 
Wouldn't it make a lot of sense to load it backwards (most recent to oldest?) or maybe forwards, validating as you go with the Genesis block, and/or asynchronously - maybe if you see a transaction that says spend from here, here and send outputs to here - maybe you could ask a full node (while you sync) for the blocks with input 1 and the block that had input 2 - and choose to just suspend disbelief about whether or not that is IRONCLAD truth until you've really downloaded the whole blockchain, but in the meantime you would know it's plausible?
Wouldn't it be nice to have the blockchain torrent-able by year and month or something? or each redifficulty target?

It should get very very interesting to see if the value settles on the smaller chain - even if the 2MB chain could in theory have more hashrate, it's also possible that doublespends against it's supporters could leave them wishing they'd stayed small.

That's all completely fine, I'm not defending the scammers.
I understand this widespread definition of securities now, I can see why the SEC applies it this way. I personally would never have allowed this kind of interpretation, but that's something courts decide not me, and I can see how the legal system - whatever lay people might think to the contrary, that they would prefer to go on precedent and take a dim view of people trying to go around the law. They generally look at the goal of the law, not just the narrow writing of it, and make it fit situations they think it should. It's very common for them to stretch the coverage to nail someone they think is a crook.
Example that supports what you're saying, how laws cover more than you would guess at first glance: "wire fraud", which was one narrow thing once upon a time but now is the go to charge for prosecutors to go after anyone that used the Internet (email, the web) to scam someone. ("In the United States, mail and wire fraud is any fraudulent scheme to intentionally deprive another of property or honest services via mail or wire communication. It has been a federal crime in the United States since 1872.") So obviously the Internet didn't exist in 1872, unless you think the telegraph was early "Internet" (which in some ways it kind of was and wasn't.) 
I'm just stupid and had assumed that securities meant stock certificates, eg ownership of a company, AND some other instruments which in my mind was vague before (I knew the law fit a few other situations besides stocks). I understand it can apply to other things now. I just wouldn't have expected it to cover hash mining, or contracts to supply oranges. (Since when is that a "security", instead of a "contract"? Apparently since decades. "Keep up. Ignorance of the law is no excuse." But honestly sometimes, the law is big, complex, covers things you would never guess. My guidance would be: don't be a scammer, and get a lawyer.)

When times are bad, the tide goes out and you see who's swimming naked is the expression. That's when embezzlement gets revealed.
The cool thing about deflationary crypto - is that embezzlers get caught in the system, unable to pay out for rising IOUs for real coins.

bitcoin is a bit complicated for the basic things we use it for.
It doesn't really need some elaborate language (Turing complete or not - and I guess it's not). 
Just an agreement to support inputs to outputs and a way to digitally sign it.
So because the original code had extra cruft, like a fancy programming language, it's going to be tougher that it would be to use if they'd just had some simplified transaction ideas, to which we could simply pass parameters that, if valid, go through as designed.
Like, if you're a programmer, I could tell you the main ideas from the paper, and if you never saw bitcoin before, you wouldn't need a bunch of opcodes etc.
I don't know if you've used other real world security protocols before, but typically the really terrible ones (they do work, and are "secure" within their limits but...) that are no fun to use are things like SSL/TLS and IPsec. Those just go on and on about very critical parameters, but they're nothing as complex as actual code. And people barely get IPsec settings to something safe and sane in actual practice.

Another thing that's interesting about bitcoin mining. Where it's happening at scale, it's a clue to two things:
1) stranded power - probably renewables, since it's "out there" and far from where it could be consumed.
2) realistic and supportive politics of power generation - meaning, instead of setting aside spare power and hoping and praying for an Alcoa aluminum smelter, and jobs, and a tax base, they truly have spare power and just want to make money. These are apolitical power sources. Like the sun outside. It just shines everywhere on earth. Whoever lets you bitcoin mine near their power plant is okay with making some money because of their intermittent and hard to store or transmit overcapacity.

Premined coins that don't need to exist, or coins that try to be money, but anyone that uses them is just being taken for a ride.
Back in the day, very modest tweaks to coins like bitcoin - eg Litecoin, could be taken as potentially shitcoins. 
Example - dogecoin, mooncoin, things like that. Simple copies of the bitcoin idea, rebranded, made early adopters rich, took the rest for a ride.
Another one would be Ripple / XRP. It's centralized, premined like 60%. Has like 5 validators, all permissioned, token not needed on it's own network. Not really clear what the token is for.

Eh you could do merge mining though without being pegged.
There's fairly low-friction exchanges between merge mined coins and bitcoin, like say, Namecoin.
So, this is just my own doofy theory and you definitely don't have to agree, but why bother pegging it, if the users think that one or the other are heavily worth switching to, they can get a fairly low-friction service like shapeshift.io or Poloniex or something, to exchange on chain for another, then you don't have to peg it.
Example, say bitcoin, the backbone coin, gets expensive enough that a transaction is worth about $1000 USD for a handful of inputs and outputs. BUT, say nominally, a bitcoin itself rises to something utterly ridiculous and almost fictionally high like on the order of a cool $1,000,000 USD each. Forex can get strangely high like that, far past the world's actual assets... So anyway, way up there, maybe you have merge-mined many other parallel bitcoin type coins, like regionally, whatever as a miner you want to participate in, out across the world, or for different groups, and maybe you're storing your paychecks way out on bitcoin  And I'm over on bitcoin  Those would be merge-minded like Namecoin is, by the same hardware that mines bitcoin, and these merge-mined coins are just a side gig for the miners. So anyway, couldn't we exchange, if it was for a LOT of value, go up and over from bitcoin  over to bitcoin  via about a 1% spread, and for small transactions that'd be worth it.
Am I off in space? How would you do it again?

Here in bitcoin, it's kind of there in miniature with BIP and that kind of bitcoin governance. There's groups that are into bitcoin, but not into the idea of having the current participants tell them what to do at all. (That's probably not very wise, but it's a free world.)

Yeah, you're never going to find a fiduciary that says 'buy bitcoin now you idiots!!' 
6 reasons:
1) first, they could be sued if they dont give the ordinary sane rational balanced advice of some percent in stocks, some in bonds, some in real estate, some in cash, some in foreign stock, index funds, blah blah blah
2) next, they literally would rather the price stayed down because a bitcoin / cryptocurrency driven future is fucking scary (to them) or that bitcoin / cryptocurrencies would be outlawed / shrivel up and die 
3) or they are buying and only want you to be slightly interested in the tech, but they want your financial life to be basically asleep at the wheel, neither buying nor selling, until they load up, and then they will pump and then they will dump.
4) or fourth thing, they are so late to the party at bitcoin's house / have missed the boat, that they are secretly pumping another coin (Etherium?) anything else in order to be on the bitcoin 2.0 bandwagon now that they've got a half a clue, but ... they also want to control the new thing and bitcoin is not so easily controlled ... plus they don't like the early adopters as people and will be fucking damned before they'll admit they didn't understand things like bitcoin because of the blinders they wear.
5) last, they could just be talking heads / empty suits / bubbleheads / shills who do what they're told
6) or secret enthusiasts who fear for their jobs if they told the truth - the best they can get away with is a lightly positive note like "hey, why not put 1% into bitcoin in case of a black swan event? couldnt hurt, just some fun money, fake magic Internet fun bux, see what happens"

I think it's weird that a computer scientist, out of anyone out there, wouldn't actually consider the bitcoin solution to the Byzantine General's problem amazing.
The next part, it's more political: what if you then used the solution to that problem to make a currency that was "mined" like gold but on a decaying function, and then kept cryptographic keys to addresses which held balances that couldn't be seized unless you had the secret key?  
(EDIT: maybe Satoshi could have used bitcoin to solve other problems, like voting, or reliable systems control in rocketry, or grading papers against cheaters, land registration, or who knows what else, so obviously it's a political act to choose currency with Libertarian or "gold bug" type properties as the problem to solve with the blockchain idea.)
That part is more political, and whatever, anyone could be against that (socialists, Statists, pro-government paranoids, law enforcement, etc.)  And others of other political stripes could be for it (anarchists, anti-big government, privacy advocates, and those elements we may not like like criminal elements, but who just the same like having a money with these properties and would use cash or gold if they couldn't use a cryptocurrency. So it's not like crime would ever stop just because this money does or doesn't exist.)
Anyway, like I said I'm more surprised that a computer scientist type wouldn't consider bitcoin to be a real tour de force, like Bill Gates said he thought it was.
Maybe if someone is both a computer scientist AND left-leaning or prefers government power for whatever reason, then you could be going through a kind of manic but ultimately ambivalent fascination with bitcoin the techno marvel and bitcoin the political currency.

@_date: 2018-12-18 21:38:44
Not really.
My bet would be because it's going to have a higher inflation rate of coin mining built in, and the little programs that use it for smart contracts have to have cheap Eth in order to be able to afford to run (gas), but on the other hand, if you want to hold it as a store of value you shouldn't be spending it. 
So it's like a money whose velocity or ease of moving around is what helps it. I think that, though a flippening seemed possible, I think they accidentally made their coin too much like paper (you can write on it!) and less like dollars (this is money to some people).
You can still trade in Eth and make like it's a currency but with the built in inflation rate being higher than bitcoins, you are in a bit of a headwind.

If they get their bitcoins out to a paper wallet, they should be able to have a tragic boating accident from there.

Well leaving aside Internet outages.
Do you think there's a use case where being able to read the blockchain, but not being able to write to it, is a big big use case?
Like where do you have a merchant who can read the blockchain, or some actor waiting to take some actions based on the blockchain, and then totally remote from them, back in  "The Internet" someone else (somehow) knows to do something and then does it... 
I just think these are very fringe use cases and I'm having a hard time grokking what kind of business case justifies it. 
But it could also be really really inexpensive and good PR, if broadcasting the blockchain is super cheap.
Do they have to make some special satellite receivers and peel out of that the info? Or just ordinary satellite TV receivers that also can peel out any other digital data, like it's all coming down in a stream from the satellites. Hmm.
@_date: 2017-06-18 01:31:09
The fees would either collapse, or logically be divided by those bidding for the space in bytes. 4x bigger blocks should let them send transactions at 1/4 the price. Unless the blocks don't fill, then the fees collapse.
If the fees to transact are too high, people switch to a nearly equally secure coin where the fees are low.
I hope this is all obvious.
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:04:15
If people run nodes, and already have most of the transactions but +/- just a few, inverse Bloom filters help them to quickly communicate about what just got mined and what transactions that new block did or didn't contain (so they don't ahve to retransmit the block, it mostly contains transactions that other nodes already know about)
That and other efficiencies are possible, so that literal blocks moving around doesn't really have to happen.
@_date: 2018-12-10 05:12:21
I'm sure that if all miners stopped mining, that we would literally roll over and let the hugely valuable bitcoin system just die totally and we would walk away and tumbleweeds would blow over.
And even though an emergency difficulty, change in POW, or other solutions are right there via hard fork, we wouldn't take them.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:19:43
No, there's not going to be an increase in the mining reward after the halving(s). That's the deal. It's quite generous. The current mining rewards are pretty good.
A cornerstone of bitcoin's value is that these things aren't going to change. If they did change, that'd be a fork, and it would go off somewhere and struggle (probably it would be vigorously shilled, then pump and dumped, then fork again).
People who stick with the main ideas of bitcoin will be fine.

Yep it can do that, it's programmable.
The tricky part is do you play the transaction later, or make a really juicy transaction that miners won't forget (like 1 bitcoin fee) and hope that they play it later.

You can have a flat antenna to talk to the satellite. The satellite will pass your traffic back down to a fiber-optic linked ground station, or pass it to other satellites probably.
You could build the antenna into your car roof, hood (front truck), or back. It might be something you could even put on the side of the car, but I bet they would just make it face upwards. But maybe you could have multiple around the car to find those low angled satellites.

Disk space gets cheaper faster than Moore's law and is still tracking way down in cost (Kryder's Law) so that's going to get cheaper.
Also, the network bandwidth that we could have is held back by real world monopolies. I think that something like a very low orbit satellite network can break a lot of the network bandwidth stranglehold in the future.
So last, I would say that I agree with you for now, just that if the future pans out well where network bandwidth increases and storage costs drop, and mesh networks become common, THEN we might see some increases in block size. It'll happen when it's easy and obvious to do, but not before.

I think you're assuming that an inflationary money with centralized printing isn't bad for the economy; like that it doesn't cause malinvestment and weird booms and busts - like the ghost cities in China.
Or like huge power plants in the middle of nowhere with no customers and no power lines to get the energy back to civilization. Those are all wastes of money.
Also we already know that Soviet style central planning is bad for an economy, because it's so dumb and easily gamed. I think you could make a good argument that it's still dumb to have the supply of money be centralized for similar reasons.
So bitcoin is an experiment and we'll see how it works out.

And if currencies won't peg, it doesn't matter. Cryptocurrencies don't actually *require* KYC to change hands. So there could be millions of shapeshift.io's out there, and the good ones will do a good service to customers, make a tidy profit, and give the inter-coin liquidity that makes them all tradeable back to whichever cryptos people want to use for 'wealth storage' (or even just something like unit of account - which one do they e-peen on as the basis for growth in value? knowing that they could get a lucky pop in an altcoin, but still, that's not lasting value necessarily.)

The period of time thats available for any clawbacks of money is the settlement time.
If theres a bank wire internationally I think those settle overnight but there is very little recourse if you want the money wired back in case of scams.
Same for withdrawing cash. You can withdraw large amounts - if you have the money as digits in an account and if you call ahead. But there will be a lot of drama.
In bitcoin a lot of the difficulty for sellers of bitcoin to others is that bitcoiners can be scammed by buyers that take the bitcoin and promise to pay or seem to pay, but once they have the sellers bitcoins they reverse the credit card or PayPal and get their money back. 
So to me, bitcoins are more real than dollars. They just jump around a lot in perceived value, have scaling issues, but are still interesting and a good lesson on what a no frills p2p digital money system could be like.

Just a quick shout out to nullc - he posted a way that someone could sign a transaction in a deceptive way, as long as the transaction had been played already into the blockchain. A better test might be a spend or move of old coins that might go further to proving someone is Satoshi. Apaprently CSW has some trick to sign like the 9th block because there's a spend from it. It's maths, and it's handwavy, but just FYI, signing a previous transaction doesn't count.

You're the confused one.
Valid transactions are not spam, they were paid for by fees. Miners don't have to mine them if they don't want to.
No one has to run a node. Node sizes in cpu, disk, ram etc are something reasonable and under a person's own control. The bitcoin network has made some tradeoffs so that nodes are inexpensive. Soon nodes will run on phones. The blockchain is fine. 
It can't scale any other way anyway than to second layers like LN or verichain or whatever. You can't ever put all the worlds transactions onto the main bitcoin blockchain directly. You could put hashes or commits to the blockchain.

@_date: 2018-12-19 19:12:30
Right but without reputation to go on, how do I know I wont be scammed on every purchase. So then I would normally use escrow. But if I can't use that either.
There can still be alternatives, like I could only make really small purchases and slowly ramp them up, and there can be a mutual understanding that the last purchase is always the final purchase and exit by the selling side. Or maybe they start to ship free products that I pay for later and again the last one doesn't get replaced until I pay (like those music clubs where they send you cd-roms you don't want).
Eh, that only works between the identity of a single buyer and seller, and I think that one of the points of money is the coincidence of wants problems. I just don't want the same thing usually month after month (some exceptions, like utilities, groceries). Maybe this could work, not sure.
bitcoin+LN will work, but I think we'll be buying from established brands or markets.  Just that because the markets and coins can be more anonymous, the products will be the kinds of things you can't easily buy in local markets. Like maybe collectibles or handcrafts.

You can use other wallets to either scan in the QR code or manually type the private key and "sweep" the wallet up into a wallet.
And you don't have to run Android wallets on an Android phone, you can simulate the Android environment etc.

1. Jordan Peterson is a controversial professor of psychology, and he likes to cover the ground of mythology, modern culture, things like that. He is going over the ideas of people like Nietzsche and Dostoevsky. He might be considered a conservative thinker (or anti-liberal), he might be considered the epitome of the privileged white male of Western Civilization. A lot of "red pill" ideas get repackaged and said better by him than by 4chan.
2. Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Patreon, and others go through waves of de-platforming people that their advertisers don't like. People selling products (like cars) want their ads seen and liked, and they don't want a lot of controversy. Politicians and advocacy groups put political pressure on VISA/Mastercard (payment processors) and on advertisers (Toyota, and other brands), not to have their ads played or hosted by sites that go against the politics of these groups.
3. bitcoin is a politically neutral money (well it has some politics, apparently the freedom to send money to whoever you want is a HUGE deal), and bitcoin exists as a way out for people that have been de-platformed. I personally thought this professor had tenure but ... anyway this is an area where cryptocurrencies shine.
I would call him a smarter conservative. A pop culture conservative, and he's making waves. Making waves is a good thing.
I think it's okay to say that he reminds me of Camille Paglia (the anti-feminist feminist), in the way he takes things apart. Anyway, a lot of people enjoy his YouTube lectures.

Big picture, some of these groups and "Exchanges" are like betting pools where they match up people betting one way versus people betting the other way. Then add in margin, and start whipsawing the volatility. Then let algos trade, and the bucket shops take a small percentage per trade (maybe not from the market maker, the passive side of the trade, but from the active trader).
Okay, so all of these are like little side bets on the speculative value of actual bitcoin.
Also out there are actual exchanges where you can buy and sell real bitcoin (and get them off the exchange afterwards). Those are where the prices are a bit more real, and what these derivative bucket shops are pointing at to get prices, ultimately.
I can understand why a miner would want to hedge using the CME and get cash-settled.
But I can see that for the price to really go up for bitcoin, it has to actually be scarce on the real exchanges where you can go and buy the real thing (and then go hodl it or use it).
So if you want to hold bitcoin and see the price go up, (rising prices indirectly lead to a rise in value too), then buy your bitcoin and Get It Off The Exchanges.
EDIT: Also, it's possible that the groups trading and using dollars as the unit of account (how they keep score), are keeping score in the wrong thing. If you stack bitcoin, real bitcoin, and an actual meltdown happens (hyperinflation of dollars, or hyperbitcoinization), then if you stacked dollars, you have lost. Use bitcoin as your hedge.

snort. You could make blocks at least 10MB without problems.
You start to have to ask how much capacity do nodes require? network bandwidth, RAM, SSD/HD storage space, CPU, etc.
The problem is, there's no payment to you to be a full node. And there's no limits or competition to be a node. Obviously miners need to have full nodes, but no one else absolutely has to have one. You can spin up thousands of nodes to signal support for different bitcoin flags, but it's like a Sybil attack.
Solvable if we said, there shalt be 5000 nodes, the payment for running a node is 1 bitcoin a year, and only the best nodes are allowed to stay on the network via a combination of storing the whole blockchain and proving it, having low latency, and accurately tracking and reporting transactions and uxto too.
Making larger blocks would be straightforward if there weren't made up stories of miners in China doing communication to bitcoin over dialup. Or people wanting to be a full node on a small Pi.

Don't bring a cell phone across the border, or a laptop.
Or get another phone and bring only that one.
And ... you can make your wallet be a set of words. 
You could put the words in the marginalia of your travel guide. 
You could make the key to some wallets be an image file. The image file could be on the Internet. The file could be xor'd with a long passphrase first, or encrypted with AES-256 first, or xor'd with 10 other images first, or ...
Or you could take a wallet as a QR code and embed it with xor'd noise into something else. Like a T-shirt pattern. 
Or you could poke holes with a pin into a grid, and look through to see a key revealed.. 
Or you could have a real bitcoin wallet, with a couple transactions and less than $20 in bitcoin in there. The fact that you're loaded with bitcoin is a myth, right?
Wallets do not contain coins. Bitcoins are values in the blockchain. Locked by private keys, possibly multisig, and that random key material can be hidden, memorized, whatever. Wallets can be recreated from these seeds, and access to bitcoin re-established. And you can definitely deny that you have no access to bitcoins because who is to say that you DIDNT give them away, or sell them to buy something the same time you bought them at localbitcoins? If the coins moved and sat still, it's not your fault you have no idea what their fate is.
Anyway, don't incriminate yourself. Just FYI, the border is regarded as a "US Constitution-free Zone" by the enforcers.

The difficulty is that the checking system or things like VISA, have a take-back period - the money is not actually "settled" for days and days and days.
But - if they send your bitcoin out - its GONE, no take backs.
So to protect themselves from scammers, everyone that sells bitcoin for dollars has to take precautions and make sure they have cash in hand to where the buyer can't get it back before releasing the bitcoin.
That's why things like escrow in bitcoin are so important.
As Coinbase, for example, trusts you over time with higher daily limits, they can only do that with people they trust.
It is a bit of a barrier to entry into crypto yes.

Bandwidth will never be free but it will be pretty cheap.
There's just a basic problem connecting every device to every other device. Especially small, affordable devices, they can't make a direct connection from the surface of the Earth, via a straight line of sight through the Earth, to another device directly. So they have to go through middlemen. All you can hope for here is encryption and some work to prevent surveillance, and then some competition, probably provided by borderless spacecraft in rotation, to mesh network your data to the other p2p end.
That's going to take a while but it will happen.

Bitconnect was a Ponzi scheme
But bitcoin is not. Bitcoin itself has immense integrity. There are no take backs. Those attributes - that law enforcement and criminals alike, can't take your bitcoin straight off the blockchain, or pass some legislation and steal it from you - they can steal the private keys, they can phish, they can scam, and they can thug on you. 
But the bitcoin blockchain, miners, nodes, the system overall - just processes valid bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin itself is not a scam. It is rock solid.

Although paper wallets are good, they just have the problem of secure private key generation. When you print them, do it to a really dumb printer. A lot of modern printers have a hard drive in them (like a multifunction device - MFD) watch out for those.

Or get a steel punch set or things like that and get something fireproof. Depends on what you think your risks are etc.

If you use MySQL as a database, like say the Federal Reserve did that, then everyone is trusting the Federal Reserve not to adjust the numbers in the spreadsheet. Say you catch them doing it, they can just say 'tough'.
In bitcoin, if you have the crypto keys, then you can unlock and move bitcoin values around and if you attach a bit of a fee, a miner will mine your transaction (along with others) and start burying it under Proof of Work until no one can feasibly undo the transaction, even if they wanted to.
So in bitcoin, there's no governor of it who can say 'okay take X bitcoins from this criminal here, and give X-1 bitcoins to this person who should have it there, and give me a bitcoin for adjudicating this as taxes'. Not possible in bitcoin - to create values out of thin air, or start moving them around -- at least not by the rules of the game so far.
Obviously, you COULD have more of the hashpower, like &gt; 51% just *decide* to disobey the rules and pay themselves extra coins and things like that - but then they are hard forked into their own coin. Whatever coin THAT is, it's not bitcoin.
People do experiment and make coins with other rules, but they have a hard time being a better money than bitcoin. They do try (though a good percentage are scams).
Anyway, I'm not a pumper (as in, pump and dump) so if you feel bitcoin is not right for you, talk to your doctor.

Not sure why you're so worried about this. Governments are made of people and misrule is very common in the world. Governments are not some holy thing that is all powerful and all knowing. If you think something they do is unjust, then hopefully you are lucky and live in a society with a just court system and a ballot box. 
Some people are not so lucky, and their governments are corrupt kleptocracies or worse.
People who believe that governments are a cure all or a powerful force that should always be obeyed or put in charge of society's solutions get labelled as "Statists" by bitcoiners, who (not all) but generally are skeptical of State power and benevolence, and who see by and large a lot of coercion or at least misrule and waste by government and a ton of problems with powerful big government.
And so, there's a side-argument that government and big business together make fascism, or government and a kind of all-knowing what's best for the worker (meaning: Inner Party) make communism, and both of those very extreme kinds of governments are what slightly anarchistic technologies like P2P (peer to peer) money like bitcoin disintermediates.
If you were wondering (probably not) about my personal politics a little bit, I can just say that I think we should abolish most taxes over time, but keep and expand real estate taxes. That's a progressive system called Georgism and there's a nice wikipedia article on it. So I believe in personal financial privacy, I still pay my taxes (Give unto Caesar what is Caesar's ... etc), but I do wish the world was a better place and I think bitcoin (and other cryptos) get us there. Disintermediate all the things!

Well, if bitcoin wallets were called 'bitcoin input address organizers and random unmemorizable unlinked to a person secret key holders'?
And if bitcoin was called 'scarce digital numbers'? 
Then they'd have to be forced to write a law like 'holders of scarce digital numbers, must declare that they control the secret keys to scarce digital numbers?
... I can't quite parse it, but maybe we could make nonsense of the law by showing what bitcoin actually is, and how, unless someone has accidentally done something REALLY dumb, they can't really know the things or have this thing this other person so simply wants declared, declared?
It's like, if they knew more about cryptocurrencies and cryptography and mathematics, and more, multisig, smart contracts, they would know how pointless it is, what they're asking for.

@_date: 2017-06-19 07:30:55
Oh sure, sorry, forgot the block limit (it was kind of a quick and dirty fix Satoshi put in place.) - Some days I wish Satoshi had taken the time to figure out how to do some kind of flex blocksize, but figured 1MB ought to be big enough for anybody and (facepalm) left it at that. 
Satoshi made that decision, despite not taking into account Kryder's Law for disk space improvements and  Nielsen's Law (bandwidth to users grows 50% annually) - and there's another "Law" Butters' Law of Photonics - that says fiber optics double in speed every 9 months. I just think that tech prognostication wasn't Satoshi's strong suit.
So ... honestly Satoshi should have probably made it so the 1MB block size increased by 50% a year, quick back of the envelope. That'd just be a maximum, a lot of blocks don't need to be that big. A miner can just choose not to make big blocks, and leave the fees on the table.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:44:03
People would rush to fill it, same total fees or better (in total) possibly.
One of the downsides of bitcoin is there's not a good way to make miners also be the keepers of the blockchain (storage), and the CPU to check transactions generously, and the RAM to hold all kinds of possible good valid transactions, and the network to communicate those quickly.
There's no incentive besides wanting to do it, to run a full node I mean. You can validate for yourself what's happening that way, but you're not paid by the system and you don't earn any bitcoin being a node.
So then piles of leeches get in and suck away all your bandwidth to make copies of the blockchain, ask your node a question, etc, unless you limit who can connect radically (then you become the leech).
It's kind of a big ball of wax and interconnecting problems. That said, it works pretty well despite the imperfections.
To your question, you can ask the opposite. If the shared storage space, or the memory of transactions is expensive to fill and use, who would use it? Wouldn't people use something that did the same thing, but cheaper?
So yes, "If there is an immutable ledger with "cheap storage," won't people rush to fill it," -- the answer is yes. They will leave bitcoin, and go to a ledger with cheap storage, and go fill that. If the usage of the bitcoin ledger falls far enough, no one will use it but diehards.
I can think of a few coins that have the same marketcap bitcoin had a few years back, and they have fast confirms (total time and hashpower is what counts though, obviously), better privacy, therefore better fungibility ... etc. (Sometimes they have new risks too, there is no free lunch.)
I'd still use bitcoin, but I'm a fan and longtime user. It's familiar and easy for me, some of the new cryptos seem kind of strange so I kind of avoid them.
If you wanted to buy things from me, I'm fine with bitcoin, and I could handle it okay if you offered Ethereum or Litecoin. I'd prefer we arranged it in Monero or bitcoin though. With a little bit of a stretch I can handle any crypto that Shapeshift.io, Poloniex, Bleutrade, etc offer exchange in. I can handle 4 coins no problem, and with a little hassle I can handle 100 more different coins if we're talking small amounts and some slippage.

You need different ASICs to mine Eth instead of bitcoin, and if you look at the inflation schedule, Eth is going to debase faster (print more units of currency) so it's stupid to hold it. If it will not gain users faster than bitcoin, probably won't, then Eth is paper to bitcoin's gold. It's all relative. On that, people make speculations.

Drivechains are fine, just read drivechain.info. This is more or less what I want, a form of merge-mining that gives you all the scale you could ever want.
The part I don't like is you all seem to think it's a good idea to not have any get rich quick-isms or speculation on these side chains by having some 1:1 or fixed ratio
That's the only part I disagree with. I think that the side-merged chains should have a stake in bitcoin locked up, but the sidechain itself should decide, in a publicly visible way, how much it's paying to go back to bitcoin. And maybe it's a 1% fee each direction, and maybe it's giving 10% to the devs irrevocably. Whatever. So that's all I'd add to this. 
I think you're just underestimating the value offered by offering a speculation in the side chain.
Otherwise, it looks fine and is exactly what I've been saying - you should be able to have bitcoin2, bitcoin3, bitcoin4, bitcoin5, all the way up to whatever scale you want. Or call them bitcoin-Coinbase1, bitcoin-BitPay1, and have some conversion costs between them. It's just natural that although the fees in that chain might be nearly 0, the fees to go between chains could be something.

Youre fine. Look up Kryders Law and Nielsens Law
Kryder noticed that disk space got cheaper faster than Moores Law increased transistor density.
Nielsen realized that home bandwidth went up 50% a year.
Related to that, fiber optic bandwith doubles every 9 months. But obviously, for now there is still a last mile problem.
A problem in bitcoin is that miners need full nodes, but unless you have deep interest in watching or exploring the records, you dont really need a lot of them.
So a problem in bitcoin is that the cost of a node is not funded. A bitcoin a year for a node would be nice. Also you only need so many nodes. Around 5000 is fine. And there ought to be a competitionand only the best 5000 nodes get paid.

Well it's irrational, because it destroys bitcoin as a valuable system if users can't spend bitcoin (take inputs and turn them into outputs).
If the only use is for miners to e-peen over piles of bitcoins that they can't pass around, collecting just the coinbase - the block reward - then it's not worth anything to anyone (but them).
So I'm supporting, semi-absurdly, what you were driving at, maybe..?

They're _barely_ conceding the point that the watering down of bitcoin value by mining seignorage, creates new coins, which at market value, for the number of transactions included in a block, makes it like there's a 'virtual' cost per transaction.
But of course what these munchkins fail to realize, is that bitcoin holders know that, and hold bitcoin anyway. It's already factored into their demand.
What they can't quite realize is that getting in and out of bitcoin to and from fiat, if you do it right, can be less than 1%, and the transaction in bitcoin is nearly nothing.
If you wanted to, if it's rational for you to, you could choose to mine bitcoin. Or don't, no one is making you.
If you wanted to, if it's something you want to speculate on, you could choose to hold bitcoin. No one is making you.

You had to have $1000 put into your lap (when I was his age I couldn't even afford D&amp;D books), no interest in Xbox etc, or a nice bike, or saving for college, AND get bitcoin, but not be into drugs / Silk Road, and be really interested in it for the maths of it.
It's all ... exceedingly unlikely. Say it's 100% true in his exact case. That's fine. Take nothing from the story. But it's still going to be rare as hen's teeth.
Another almost as likely a way in would have been to be really into SecondLife and Linden Dollars and tried out bitcoin that way.
EDIT: and a followup comment about the rigged Monopoly game study: 
Again, kid gets bitcoin when it was cheap, thinks he is God's gift to investing.
I think a part of the mythology about things like bitcoin is that they are once-in-a-lifetime occurrences. But in actuality, even Buffet would say that there are million dollar opportunities all around you. But he doesn't have time to chase those around. He has to find billion dollar opportunities. That said, there are ass loads of scams and 99% of the things that look like they could make you good money are just another way to lose your money.
Also, a lot of people when you get into bitcoin, your antennas for scams start to get stronger and better tuned. A lot of the stories of 'young kid strikes it rich' are actually just the parents fronting a business with their child in order to jump start them into being a business owner and to get wealthy people to part with their dollars. Young people have a lot of charisma. A young twenty year old is more likely to be successful at conning an old person to break out their checkbook for a part of the business than a hustling 50 year old could get.
Kind of like Tiger Wood's dad relentlessly teaching his child golf. There can be some basic talent in the kid, but the relentlessness of making a small child practice and practice, is kind of a pushy thing that comes from a certain kind of domineering parent too.

This is an easy way to play yourself in bitcoin.
You buy some, but since you are so used to a mentality that things you have should be productive assets (like stocks or real estate) that bitcoin sitting there feels unnatural.
So your first instinct is to invest it in something, like lend it out at bitfinex, or go find a bitcoin lending site like BitConnect.
Big mistake.
Simply buy bitcoin, and if you think you have too much, then sell it. 
But don't trade up your already really high risk (just holding bitcoin to speculate on future value) to an even higher risk (losing it all to a scammer).

Oh yawn, the guy knows currency but on this one I think he's wrong.
It's not that blocks in theory couldn't just be a signature signing a nearly unlimited sized but external block kept somewhere else. Just that, that wouldn't be on chain, by definition.
And people have transactions to transact. If no one uses it as money, it's not money.

Sure, a blockchain like bitcoin can hold a little bit of information along with a transaction.
Implementations of these ideas are usually called "colored coins". 
They're bitcoin, usually microscopic amounts of bitcoin, with little messages on them. 
So then there's a date and time and the bitcoin blockchain is essentially a notary service.
Bitcoin itself however, is unaware, without using something called 'Oracles' of what the real world is out there doing. The bitcoin system only really knows itself.
So you wind up subject to human interpretation in the end. Meaning, if you notarize on the bitcoin blockchain that you bought or sold something valuable, that's fine, but it will only be respected and enforced out in the real world if anyone cares what's on the blockchain.
Given that limitation though, it works fine.

You could! You could have a smart contract that paid out to any public address meeting some not too difficult criteria - like a vanity address in a specific block

Fucking hell, that's easy! Lo and behold, cha-ching!
For security's sake, dont use 1ninja, but some other plausible "vanity" and maybe have some way to "confirm" it with something else, almost like ... you put out a vanity address that looks random, the contract gives it about 1 satoshi (not very suspicious, since shitheads put dust onto addresses all the time), then you respond by putting a specific quantity of satoshi there (like a password - say 1101 satoshi), and then the contract fills it with the rest.

Well currently the blockchain is around 30 GB.
30 GB is not very much space, you can get an "expensive" USB flash drive for around 25 bucks to store it, or you can get a much less expensive SATA hard drive 1TB or more for about 100 bucks. 
If you change things though so that the max transaction size goes from hard coded 1MB to 1GB, then you have new issues.
First is that, in theory, the big big big mining pools don't like competition. And they can mine any valid transactions they like. A valid transaction could have 0 fees. So they could make up a bunch of addresses and just have transactions going in circles just to fill disk space. Why do that? Because effectively, you would be forcing full nodes and other miners to start looking at having to store several terabytes of data in just a few months. It could start to go up to being 1 Terabyte every 8 days or so. That would consume disk space, bandwidth, CPU for blockchain analysis. The goal would be for them to kick out the casuals. The rough cost just for storage would go to about $5000 a year. No biggy for a big business but maybe 10x-100x what a casual bitcoin peasant like me would want to pay to play.
So Gavin had an idea to slowly raise this limit over time.
That may or may not stick because it's a hard fork and anytime you have a hard fork you have to do a little game theory: stay with the old system or switch? And think about which direction the value goes or stays on and whether or not you get swindled by moving forward or lose out by staying behind. Really tough trade offs.
Next something like Maidsafe etc. Um having nodes all point to the cloud for their storage may or may not help. De-duplicating data might make it cheaper, centralizing data might make it censorship attackable, decentralizing it might mean data disappears out from under you, unless you do math to make sure there's redundancy, unless the redundancy is fragile and no one is really keeping up their copy, etc etc etc. Not sure if it helps or not.

There's usually a reversion to the mean eventually. In the large field of investors, bitcoin has mostly good years, some bad ones. So it's like rolling a six-sided die, where on a 1 or 2 it goes down and on a 3456 it goes up. So then you place your bets.

Is your goal something like this: is there a way for a miner to signal good will, by doing something good for everyone, and provably not accepting a reward?
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:01:35
You're mixing all kinds of different systems together.
In a car park, the owner is getting paid to have people park there, or else they tow them. They can set the fees to what they like. If someone wants to park a van in there with their stuff inside, fine. If someone else wants to commute daily and there's no space, then the "greed" of the car park owner makes them raise prices. Then there's space again. If it's very lucrative, another car park gets built so that supply rises to meet demand.
Bitcoin chose deliberately limited block sizes at the base layer so that there would be this kind of fee system and so that nodes could be reasonably sized.
This also means that it's uneconomical to actually put every possible transaction in the world onto that base layer, so you have to build second layers.
Depending on what you know how to code, or can get funding for, you can then make a second layer solution that does a few commits of key data to the blockchain to tie down or anchor your second layer solution.
It's cool that LN uses real actual bitcoin transactions, and it's a shrug that Veriblock did their own altcoin or whatever, but this is a permissionless system.
Anyway, as for email spam, the whole reason you get spam is that it costs nothing for them to send, and costs the receiver disk space, and they get  their time wasted reading them.
Ironically one of the very basic starting ideas for bitcoin was how to solve the spam problem. One solution is to make spammers pay in hashcash attached to their message. You get paid to read the email. If it's not a high enough amount, you never even look at it. They can't spam because they run out of money.  You can "read" emails all day, getting richer and richer. For your friends maybe you actually attach a special larger amount that you use between you and them. Like a note with about 0.001 bitcoin back and forth with it.
As the other poster suggests you should check out fee markets.
Like congestion pricing for driving in cities.
People hate the idea, then try it, then love it.
I actually wish that a lot of sold out items, full car parks, etc, would just set their prices higher. It would help a lot. People that urgently need something could still get it.
Like I think you should have the ability to put a blue light on your car, turn it on, and take the diamond lane, paying something like 0.01 bitcoin a mile. 
Example - you're late to work. If you don't make that key client meeting, you lose a multimillion dollar sale. It's worth paying a high price to get priority.

1. halvening - 4 years of once every 10 minute blocks pass since the last halvening, I think it's exactly 4 \* 365 \* 24 \* 6 blocks (as if there literally really is a block every 10 minutes) - like 210240 blocks? I think the passage of time is counted in blocks only. Not day/month/year etc. So depending on how fast blocks come out, it could arrive early or late on the calendar.

If nodes - lets say 50% - go and decide to follow a ledger with made up rules of their own choosing - well, that is something like the UASF.  The nodes, if the user base that finds bitcoin valuable, agrees with them, then those nodes and those users get to claim to be bitcoin - effectively. Whether or not their fork really is in the spirit of bitcoin just depends on a case by case basis.
Also, there are nodes that matter, and nodes that don't matter. I hope to God exchanges are running their own nodes. Those are nodes that matter. Nodes that don't are all the virtual machines I could spin up with a script at Amazon. So if there are 100 exchanges out there, each with 1 node. And I run 900 at Amazon. The fact that my 90% of the nodes - with some bonky new "pay walloon5 10% of all bitcoin mined" rule - that doesn't mean jack squat. None of the other nodes are going to consider my payout transaction valid. There's no way I'm finding mining hashpower that will mine blocks of the appropriate difficulty that put that into their coinbase transaction, and if I just make up weird shit the other nodes block me.
If you meant, I can find nodes that matter (like at exchanges) and mining hashpower, to mine coins that people actually find valuable, and it runs a new set of rules that don't look like bitcoin anymore - like they pay the cartel something (something more than they already get with the coinbase?) - like say this mining and exchange group totally takes over bitcoin - has 75% of the nodes, 75% of the SHA256 hashpower, and 90% of the exchanges on their side, and at least 50% of the software and hardware wallet vendors too, and decides that they will change the coin payout in 2020 to NOT cut the supply in half, so they can keep making blocks and have them get more of the share than older miners - and then, in blatant disregard of everything that defines bitcoin - have the gall to call themselves bitcoin and get to keep the BTC symbol etc.   In that case, nothing stops them.  But a side group, that has 25% of the nodes (enough to connect to each other), 25% of the SHA256 hashpower, 10% of the exchanges, 50% of the software and hardware wallet vendors - they would have to tweak their hashing algorithm, to be SHA256 for about a year, plus some special protection, until they could switch and not have their hashing be attacked. Maybe they would go to SHA3 or something. But if they kept the mining rewards schedule, that might be in the true spirit of bitcoin - it would be more important to cut supply predictably over time rather than be so worried about which hash algo is in use. SHA2-256 was just convenient, you could use any hash algo that's good. Anyway, over time, the market would reward the coin with more limited and predictable supply with market value. I expect the second coin, that started as an underdog to a majority fork, would win out. 
That does not mean I think BCH or BSV are that coin. I think the first was kind of dumb, and the second was a scam.
Dump - anyone who dumps and sells is no longer a participant in that crypto. 
Eh. Well bitcoin is working just fine so theory and practice are a bit different.
We have some of these splitters - bch and bsv are good examples. MAYBE bch thinks it's truly the inheritor of the title bitcoin but by "market cap" they are not. bsv just looks like an idiotic cash grab.
Their nodes are enforcing their own consensus rules over there... Anyone can go join them.
And the US dollar system is a much more shitty and opaque system than bitcoin. Completely permissioned. Good luck innovating or doing interesting things on that side of the fence.
At least in bitcoin no one needs anyone's permission to try out whatever they want to.

Their point of view is going to make them late adopters of cryptocurrency and it doesn't really matter.
Their point of view boils down to: we can't think of good reasons to be in this besides some kind of Greater Fool speculation game. So we're out.
That's fine, stay out. No one is going to miss em. The main advantage they have is realizing how much they benefit from the current system, and how much they stand to lose if decentralization takes hold.

I thought pooled mining would figure out what range of nonces (there's an embarrassingly large amount of space to check) your miner can go check, and once you have that, you can mine away happily. I assume you could either run a full node or be told, here's the block and the coinbase header we want, and here's the search space for your miner. Get going. Then your miner crunches away and if it finds something it passes back in milliseconds the nonce and some bits that solved the block, or ... 99.99999999% of the time, your miner is told here's a new block, start working on this one...
Your payout is based on your hashrate and you get paid some microfraction of bitcoin to your payout address once you accumulate enough to get paid. (Approximately a fraction of the electrical power you're spending to mine).
