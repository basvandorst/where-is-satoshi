Wait it out in my opinion, I just sold. But then again, who the fuck knows, your gut instinct is probably just as accurate as anyone else's prediction.

Of course in the long term looking back everything seemed low, but if buying now, we might not see this price for months after a subsequent crash.

Well that's if you have patience. I can't hold like that, it would have been more profitable if I did too.

4. Bitcoin will likely not reach it's previous all time high for years to come. 
Oh wait, that's not good news?

Man the fuck you mean its good news. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:38:38
This sort of shit is fucking ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:27:37
Hmmmm. Looks like were heading to 2000s. Time to buy, huh?

No he said he waited and bought at a much lower price after it crashed from it's all time high. You're question is pretty stupid because, no it's not good to buy at an all time high. Sure, you might make profit down the line if it either continues going up, but it also might crash right after you buy. To which you'd have to wait however long it takes for it to break another ATH. 
You're question should be, is bitcoin still looking bullish, and is there a chance that I am buying at only the midpoint of this bull run? To which you will receive nothing but words, because no one knows not even goldman sach's cunt.

I don't know if it's going to go down? No one knows, by your logic every question regarding buying bitcoin should be YES. 
And if you were holding for the long future, then maybe it would be. But most newcomers buy at the all time high and panic sell.

If you're going to buy drugs from the deep web, make sure u replace the bitcoin u spend right after.

Bitcoin sold off many times my friend, and it will again and again.

Yeah man I've invested 10$ and I'm almost positive in the next few years I'll be up there with bill gates.
