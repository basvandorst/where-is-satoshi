Thank you! 
 
A few questions. If you own bitcoin can you chose to sell it for a specific currency ? 
 
Is there a mechanism of fixing the price or is it done naturally when people buy/sell things ? 
 
How does the supply "drop" in certain areas ?

It is complicated if you are not from the US and/or a specific type of backround. 
 
You are using this phrase and assume everyone knows what it means...you are assuming I can take a logical leap and "figure this out" because your comment was helpful.well that it wasn't. 
 
Your comment only leads towards many other questions or books, thats not helpful in this case. Check out u/theymos he did a great job

A good answer, thanks a lot! 
 
One question, when you say people holding JPY currency, who are you talking about ? Is a bitcoin bought with one currency different from the other ?

I don't understand what you are saying. What was your response ?

Both comments are pretty much useless. I indicated that I'm no expert in this... saying "supply and demand" is pretty much like "pink bike elephant" or any other random words.

It helps, thanks

ELI5 please. 
I used a simple example, i was hoping for a simple/clear answer... 
 
What are you saying? How does buying/selling different currencies affect bitcoin price ?
