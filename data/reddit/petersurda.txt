Depends on how much effort and how much control you want over the process, how much money it is and what your ultimate goal is. It's a wide spectrum of choices.
If you want to do as little as possible, then probably getting a merchant account from companies like coinbase or bitpay is the best choice. Make sure to set your payout currency to whatever you prefer (dollar/euro/pound/...), or maybe they allow you to exchange after you receive the payment, I don't know for sure, haven't used either recently. Just don't keep the Bitcoins with a third party.
On the other extreme is a DYI solution where you do everything yourself. You retain full control over the process, but need to understand what you're doing because it's easy to screw up.

Even if he never had a valid contract, that does not mean 1btcxe can steal from him. So it does not automatically follow that they can refuse his withdrawal requests.
That being said, if he's underage, he should use platforms that don't hold his funds, e.g. mycelium local trader.

This type of problem is not new, it was the same in the past when using mycelium through orbot (tor), for example. What appears to be new is that the non-payment-protocol is disabled, in the past when clicking on the qr code it switched between the payment protocol and a traditional bitcoin uri.

Both ledger nano S and trezor support legacy BTC, segwit BTC and BCH from a single seed, I tried both. Ledger uses BIP44, I tried its legacy as well as segwit xpub with other software and it works (legacy addresses can easily be checked with Mycelium wallet, for example). I think Trezor also uses BIP44 but am not 100% sure, its legacy xpub is compatible with Mycelium wallet, I haven't tried segwit compatibility yet.

If you're a proponent of privacy, you can also donate to Bitmessage. Yesterday I setup a donation address and posted this in the bitmessage chan:
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA256
    
    Due to the feedback, I setup a Bitcoin donation address for PyBitmessage development:
    
    1HJntH9c8o91CWVJ5wRWvGtNhNQykWL7Hi
    
    These are the rules:
    
    1. This is a dirty hack until a more normal solution can be found
    2. I (Peter Surda) control this address
    3. This address will be used to pay people helping on the PyBitmessage project. It will not be used to pay me or Mailchuck Ltd
    4. The activities covered are things like development, design, writing documentation, helping organising, running infrastructure, user support, security audit
    5. I will make the final decisions who gets paid how much, based on input from the PyBitmessage users and other helpers. This is because I am familiar with the project and its problems. The original author, Jonathan Warren (Atheros), is not spending that much time on the project anymore
    6. If you want your donation to be spent on a particular issue, send me (or publish) a message signed with the key associated with the bitcoin address you made the payment from. Otherwise I have no way to make sure the donator is the same person as the one requesting solving that particular issue. Alternatively, you can use bountify.co and let me know so that I can track it.
    7. It should be possible to track progress of pending things on github (I can't promise that for all types of activities but at least those that are close to the software side should be fine)
    8. After money is spent, I will publish what it is for and if possible who the recipient is (anonymous/pseudonymous helpers are possible). I will try to do this in advance in order to have feedback, but it may not be possible in all cases (there could be emergencies or something, like with the 0.5.4 release where the originally published windows binary required Windows 10 and I only found out after people complained).
    
    I'm singing this with the PGP key I use for github commits/releases.

I agree that the financial infrastructure hides what is really happening from the end-users. Most people do not understand how it works. But it makes it easier to avoid holding cash and easier to switch to something else (e.g. bitcoins). Prior to this, maybe 30-40 years ago and earlier, the connection between taxes and currency made sense, now it doesn't. It's mostly network effect and transaction costs. However, when the inflation rises or banks become insolvent, you see very quickly the state making steps to penalise the use of alternatives.

Ok, so first of all, in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, you need to set
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
For those services you want to use libpam-bitid, put this into the config file (this particular one is for ubuntu, maybe you may need to adjust it for your distro):
    auth    sufficient      pam_bitid.so file=/etc/bitid-accounts.conf qr=1 hostname=hostname-for-bitid-callback port=31000-32000
    auth    [success=1 default=ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure use_first_pass
    auth    requisite                       pam_deny.so
    auth    required                        pam_permit.so
    auth    optional                        pam_cap.so
the deny, permit and cap were already there. For bitid, the parameters specify where the map of usernames to bitcoin addresses is, what hostname to put in the callback URI (should point to the same machine) and a port range (since each active login prompt requires one port).
pam_unix also needs to be there to initialise the session, it just needs to have use_first_pass instead of try_first_pass in order to suppress plaintext authentication.
What you can also do (what I did), is to copy common-auth into bitid-auth, and just change the  in whichever services you want to use bitid instead of plain text auth.

There is a certain element of truth in that (in particular from historical point of view), but in general it's not true. Governments do not accept taxes in legal tender (cash) only, they also accept in in some other forms of money (e.g. wire transfers, which are not legal tender), and sometimes do not accept cash at all. "Legal tender" means that the courts recognise cash payment as an obligation settlement if there is a dispute. If I pay with gold, for example, without a specific arragement with the payee, he could take me to the court and claim that I still owe him. If I pay with cash on the other hand, the court will probably rule in my favour even if the payee objects.
The "taxes" concept of money has less relevance nowadays due to broad access to forex markets and cashless payment systems. You can get around without holding any legal tender at all, and let the financial system take care of settlement for you.
There are laws which obligate people to accept coins or notes in certain cases. In Austria, where I live, there is such a paragraph in the Law of Central Bank (Nationalbankgesetz) about Euro bills, and one about Euro coins in the Coinage Law (Scheidemünzengesetz). However such laws are typically only enforced when the economy is growing more centralised (like in the communist countries).

I'll shamelessly promote my own project:  Unlike most other privacy enhancing email solutions, which promise they will keep your IP address to themselves, I never even have your IP, because communication occurs through bitmessage. This extends to payments as well, the user is not required to visit any website to pay (I spent a lot of time on figuring out a private payment interface). So even if the system is hacked or I am coerced, the attacker still wouldn't know the user's IP address.
Unlike neomailbox, bitcoin payments on mailchuck are processed automatically, I host my own full bitcoin node. Transactions are processed with 0 confirmations so it's almost instantaneous (in case of a double spend, this is detectable but I have to resolve it manually). Moreover, I don't charge at the moment as it's in beta.
Currently, I don't offer hosting your own domains, but the back end supports it and I can manually add a domain to the system.

I don't understand what the actual argument is. That the proportion real trade vs. forex is higher with fiat than with Bitcoin? So what? Why is it relevant?
As Bitcoin is at a relatively early stage towards becoming money (it is a medium of exchange rather than money), this is actually the expected outcome. Similarly as gold or stocks (other examples of media of exchange) primarily also trade against fiat money rather than goods or services.
The relevant factor is the willingness of participants in the bitcoin ecosystem to hold Bitcoins for its liquidity services, not what they do with it once they dispose of it. And this one is difficult to ascertain empirically.

I suppose you mean that it is a service rather than a good. You can view it this way, but that merely shifts the concept of the good one step back (to the owner of the shop).
The point is that the shop provides value to the people who shop there, even though they are not consuming it and the shop owner is not producing anything.


So does a retail shop have intrinsic value or not?

The situation is similar in other countries, in particular in Europe. However, I believe the effect is overblown. This only affects if the person who sells Bitcoins (or pays with them) is a GST/VAT registered business and the person buying Bitcoins (or the payee) is not. This might be the case for Bitcoin ATMs and companies selling BTC on their own behalf. Buying BTC for cash from a private person, in cash or on an exchange, as far as I understand, is not affected.
That's not to say it's not a hassle, but it's not a fatal problem either.

First of all, it is not new that this affects companies located outside of the EU. They already were supposed to charge VAT based on the customer's country of residence since 2003. What is new in this directive affects intra-EU invoicing.
Also, using Bitcoin, or anything else (currency, barter or whatever else) does not affect the amount of VAT you're supposed to charge, at least in those countries where I investigated the VAT laws. The "Bitcoin VAT issue" is a separate one, whether VAT is to be charged in the opposite direction.

This is a good point. What we need to realise is that transaction costs are heterogeneous. It might very well be that now, a normal guy in a developed country has little use for Bitcoin. Less developed countries might have a broader palette of scenarios where Bitcoin makes sense. In particular a combination of high level of inflation with capital controls seems to create a perfect storm for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin will expand primarily there where it decreases transaction costs the most and/or where trades are most sensitve to them. For example online shops (in particular so called high risk merchants), non profits and as you say remittances. But we don't know exactly which path it will take.
Some imporatnt differences between a financial system based on Bitcoin (or something like Bitcoin) are that there are no privileges for production of Bitcoin, there is a clearer separation between money supply and credit, more people have access to the financial system and have greater control over who they can receive from and send to. And that it would be more efficient and probably a smaller proportion of the economy.

I have two different replies to it.
The first one is that I don't think that the price stability is relevant to a very large extent for the demand for a medium of exchange. Some people, in particular macroeconomists (with very few exceptions), seem to think that it is. But this is because they are used to the analysing the final step of the evolution, a fully mature monetary system. The second group are those that hate bitcoin and don't hold it anyway. In my opinion, people will gradually stop complaining, and get used to volatility.
I had interesting talks when I was at the LaBitcoinf in Argentina in December. Tony Gallippi, the CEO of BitPay, said that while in the "developed" countries, merchants typically want to receive fiat from BitPay's services, in Argentina noone wants pesos. To them the argument that Bitcoin is volatile is laughable, because the value of the peso also changes rapidly, but only in one direction. It is entirely possible that the use of Bitcoin will grow first in those countries that have the worst monetary systems.
The second thing is that from economic point of view, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the demand for a medium of exchange is the willingness to hold it as a part of liquidity portfolio, not how frequently it is used for trading. People can have multiple media of exchange in their liquidity portfolio, with different qualities and volatility.
I for example got increasingly used to volatility, and use Bitcoin more as a medium of exchange than a speculation vehicle, i.e. I spend it when I need to buy something else rather than when I think the price is beneficial.

It looks like you do not have actual data, your argument is not well thought through and you do not understand how purse.io actually works.
Buying bitcoins with credit cards (and similar) in general is problematic due to chargebacks. It is thus normal to expect that such trades happen at a premium. That does not imply that such a transaciton is fraudulent, rather it shows the inability of the processor to accurately distinguish fraudulent transactions in advance. On the other hand, a credit card is a common and easily accessible form of short term credit. So using a credit card to buy bitcoins can be desirable from the point of view of a buyer, but they also need to expect a higher price.
Now, Amazon deals with credit cards fraud a lot, so they have worked out sophisticated methods how to mitigate the risk. I'm pretty sure they also apply statistical analysis on their use of APIs, so if they have a problem with purse.io, their triggers will pop up and they can deal with them. I wonder why you are attempting to do Amazon's fraud department's job for them?
In essence, purse.io outsources their credit card fraud analysis to Amazon. I'm sure they are both run by mature adults who can make their own decision about whether or not to entertain a commercial relationship.
The chance that you won't receive the product that has been ordered for you and you'll lose the Bitcoins as well might affect digital goods, but for physical goods it doesn't exist, because purse.io holds the funds in escrow and they are only released if you confirm the delivery.
The allegation that the spender of Bitcoins is "facilitating fraud", besides not being supported by evidence, is equally meaningful as arguing that Amazon facilitates fraud.

That's an interesting point. I've been kind of fringe as long as I remember. I was a minarchist (later anarchist), atheist, linux geek, IP opponent and so on. But I learned (at least I think I did) to separate the empirical, the normative and the logical. Whether A requires B is a different issue from whether A will actually arise if B occurs, and whether I like A or not.
I discuss the ideological clash a bit in my thesis and I also attempted to explain it in at least one of my lectures.

There appear to be bubble-like phases in Bitcoin's evolution, and speculation does influence its price in general. However, there are also transaction costs and liquidity premia that influence it, so the distinction is not a clear cut.
I admit that it is difficult empiricaly to differentiate between all the individual motivations for buying/selling Bitcoin. Maybe we can only know what really happened in hindsight.
The sensitivity to volatility is a subjective matter. People in countries wih a higher rate of inflation, based on anecdotal evidence, seem to be more receptive of volatility. I also got used to it.

It's not a BS. The 51% attack is still at least theoretically possible, and there isn't an agreed upon method for mitigating it. This needs to be researched and better understood (and it is being researched and tried to be understood). Some experts, e.g. Dan Kaminsky, see the 51% attack risk as an urgent problem.
However, at least we know that it would be expensive. It is not straitforward to get so much money, it needs to go through bureaucracy etc.
And if they try it and fail, that would be really embarrasing.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:24:57
Now, I agree that some people buy and sell Bitcoin at the "wrong" time, and that this necessarily means that others benefit from it. But we also need to consider that different types of goods have different liqudity premia and different transaction costs. These factors can provide utility independently of whether those people gain and lose due to price fluctuations.
If Bitcoins continues to gain price, this might also mean that it is displacing other media of exchange. In such a case, the people who lose are not necessarily those who trade their bitcoins away, but those who hold these other media of exchange (e.g. fiat money), and/or who  have their income pegged to the value of those fiat moneys (e.g. fixed income salaries or fixed interest rate lenders). In other words, the costs would be externalised.

Yes, I understand the objection. I started arguing about Bitcoin before I had any, and I think I have been consistent about it irrespective of whether the price was rising or falling. I never told anyone to buy (or sell) bitcoins. On the other hand, Garrick Hileman said at the San Jose 2013 Bitcoin conference that he has no Bitcoins in order to remain impartial, so we asked him if he also holds no fiat money. Furthermore, as Nasim Taleb argues, having no skin-in-the-game is suspicious.

Hey Andreas,
sorry for not replying yet on account of being lazy. I don't know what his opinion about the velocity, I can provide mine. Based on my research, the velocity of Bitcoin is probably lower than that of fiat. I know I claimed something else in my thesis, but when I was trying to improve the code for calculating the velocity, it turned out it was quite wrong. But that's not that important.
Important is that the velocity spikes both at the top and at the bottom of the bubble, and appears to be rising over longer periods (or at least not sinking). While this does not necessarily allow to conclude what the future will be, it clearly disproves the hoarding argument. I actually plan to write either a blog post or a paper where I address this and his other arguments.

Not "no financial instruments". Rather, money supply not containing financial instruments. This is an important point. This is why I specifically said "gold-backed money", to make it clear that apart from gold, there were financial instruments that were components of the money supply.
Regarding Weisenthal's post: he writes:


In other words, if something else is the unit of account, the alleged deflationary problem does not arise.
Regarding negative interest rate (your linked post): of the unit of account was deflationary, there would be no negative interest rate because the prices of capital goods are derived from the prices of consumer goods. The negative interest rate with a deflationary medium of exchange is only possible when it's not the UoA (i.e. now). But when it's not a UoA then it won't be used for denominated debt contracts anyway.
Last but not least, let me repeat that there is a difference between the argument that a deflationary currency would fail, and that a deflationary currency would be bad for the economy. Keynesians argue for the latter, not for the former.

This "confirmation time" is a misunderstood concept. You do not have to wait one confirmation, just you are exposed to certain risks prior to that.  This type of risk is a new concept and thus people are unfamiliar with it and the software is not prepared to handle it. But there are ways of mitigating that risk so that it behaves more predictably.
When I last investigated this, bitcoin-qt simply ignored a newly received transaction if it was a double-spend attempt. Instead, it could print a warning. This is not overly difficult to implement (the merchant terminal can simply ask the major mining pools directly) and is in my opinion an easy to understand and works reasonably well. It's not perfect but it compensates against the commonly understood attack scenario. It doesn't prevent "secret premining attacks", but such attacks attempting to target a POS transaction probably aren't a good idea, you'd have to loiter around the shop while waiting for the premine to happen, already have the goods ready and not have to wait long in a queue before the POS.
You need to remember, there are no perfect solutions. But Bitcoin is relatively flexible and at the same time difficult to understand.

I did not "have to correct myself". You didn't read carefully what I wrote. I was clear from beginning.


I was not necessarily wrong here either, I just used the terms in a different way than you are used to. You yourself say things like "business would only be willing to borrow money at -5%", which is exactly the same phenomenon I am addressing.


And what I'm saying is that if an investment does not lead to satisfaction consumer's needs, it is a misallocation of capital and makes us poorer.


This is also not true. This argument has been made by Bryan Caplan, for example, but [it has been explained why it's wrong](


This is true. But from this you incorrectly conclude that if an expected RoI below the appreciation rate discourages an investor from an investment, this automatically means that such an investment should be done.


This is exactly the incorrect implication that I'm talking about. It does not follow. If it did, then we could make a reductio ad absurdum argument, that money should be created as long as unemployed capital goods exists. It ignores that the price of capital goods is derived from the price of consumer goods. It has the causality turned around.

I explained on several places, including my master's thesis, why fractional reserve banking with Bitcoin is not likely to happen. There would probably be a more strict separation of money supply and credit. That credit or financial instruments in general still can be issued at will is not that important macroeconomically if it does not act as a part of the money supply.
The main issue that I see with the financial system is that you need to be privileged to create money and financial instruments. If you're not, you're put into jail either for counterfeiting or for operating a bank without a license. With Bitcoin, this problem doesn't exist, at least with respect to the creation of money. The creation of financial instruments based on Bitcoin is still somewhat restricted (SEC/CFTC in the US), this still might be a problem.

Yes, but the issue is not the existence of needs as such, but the fact that capital goods are scarce and therefore whoever is employing them needs to make a choice with respect to which needs they will be used to satisfy. This is where your whole theory fails: it ignores that this choice exists. If a capital good is used to satisfy need X, it cannot also be used to satisfy the need Y. From the fact that you see an unsatisfied need Y, we cannot assume that the capital goods should be used to satisfy this need.


I've been told this occasionally. However, irrespective of if it's true, it does not fix the logical errors in your arguments. Me being stupid still leaves you being in error.


That's not what it says. It says that the investors are malinvesting even though they know the data they have is incorrect and will lead to malinvestments, because they believe that someone else will end up being the sucker and not them.


If you do not claim this, then there is no reason for your objection in the first place.


Again, I agree that an expected RoI below the rate of deflation will lead to the investment not being done.
However, as I said, the price of capital goods is derived from the price of consumer goods, therefore there is no reason to assume that any particular monetary model will leave capital goods unused if there are needs to be satisfied. If we do indeed see that capital goods are unused, it must have a different explanation. The explanation that you provide is not logically possible, and it is thus unlikely the remedy you suggest would achieve the desired intent.


Thank you for bringing this up. It shows that this fallacy is widespread.


This does not address my point, it avoids it. The issue at hand is not whether capital should be employed, but out of the available options, which do investors take and which will they forego.

In principle, of course something can overtake Bitcoin. But what you need to realise is that the features Schiff is looking for in a competing medium of exchange were the primary reason why the past competitors failed. Bitcoin learned from these failures. Schiff didn't. It's more like a wishful thinking on his part, he wishes that the system worked differently. It doesn't. The state eliminated a lot of competition for Bitcoin. And at a certain stage of liquidity, due to the network effect, it might become irrelevant irrespective of what the state does.
@_date: 2014-02-07 16:15:09
The problem with the argument that less investment is being done due to lower expected RoI in a falling price level is that the actual resources are scarce even if the money supply changes. And "more investment" could just be malinvestment due to disruption of price structure caused by an increase in the money supply (a more general version of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory). It could be that the "less investment" is the correct entrepreneurial response with respect to the available resources and needs of consumers. We just don't know as long as there is the Cantillon effect.
We both agree that Bitcoin appreciated, so I don't really understand what the problem is. That it is expected to continue to apprecitate? So what?
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:08:51
Also, regarding intrinsic value, Bitcoin has the capacity to decrease transaction costs, and that creates value, independently of whether it is also a medium of exchange.
An extreme example of a good that decreases transaction costs, only works if money already exists and has no use as a producer or a consumer good or a medium of exchange is a cash register. Cash register has utility because people trade and use cash. Some more loose examples are trucks or any transportation vehicles or warehouses.
I treat this also in the yet-unpublished paper in a bit more formal way.

I don't know how it works in Australia, but in Europe when you are a VAT-registered business, you also get a VAT-deduction for your expenses. If the Coffee Co in your example sells Bitcoins to another VAT-registered business (such as a bulk buyer trading on their own behalf), they don't need to charge VAT. I.e. it not only affects sales to foreign residents but also to EU businesses that are VAT registered.
Coffee Co in the EU just needs to make sure they do not sell the bitcoins to resident non-businesses or resident small businesses (which can opt to be VAT exempt).

It's probably best to start that Bitcoin is primarily a protocol rather than a currency. Similarly as say the English language. It creates a lot of heated debates, because it is based on the idea that your money belongs to you and noone should be able to prevent you from spending it on whatever you want. This makes it collide with the banking system, because banks like to tell you what you may or may not do with your money. It also makes it collide with governments, because they also like to tell you (via the banks) what you may or may not do with your money.
It's also one of the most transparent systems ever, and an example of decentralised trust (as opposed to hierarchical trust that we are accustomed to). This creates confusion as well because a lot of people do not comprehend how decentralised trust works conceptually. People who do theoretical math and/or programming find it easier to understand. Calculus, for example, does not work because we trust Leibnitz or Newton, or because there is someone "in charge" of calculus, but becase it is a transparent concept that can be audited. Similarly, Bitcoin does not work because we trust the guys who wrote it or that there is someone "in charge" of Bitcoin, but because it's a transparent concept and can be audited.
The decentralised nature makes it incredibly difficult to prevent it from working by malicious actors. The working of Bitcoin should not be confused with the volatility of the market price, similarly like the dot com bubble should not be confused with whether the internet works or not.
Bitcoin decreases transaction costs of trade, and that provides it with value. This of does not preclude it from being used for speculation as well, and it's difficult to empirically distingiush between the two.
Noone knows how Bitcoin will ultimately end up, just like noone could predict 20 years ago how the internet would evolve. But the internet is a protocol, just like Bitcoin is a protocol, and allows people to build new types of businesses on top of it, and make existing businesses more profitable. If Bitcoin spreads in use, there will also be losers, people who didn't adapt their businesses because they did not comprehend the potential and risk of staying behind.

I paid for hosting at a French company. Here is my feedback:
The website is only partially in English and most of the pages switch into French. That's not a huge problem as google translate works and let's be honest, there's not much to understand in such a system anyway. The hosting provider also only has a French website and I managed (I don't speak French).
The website UI is simple and easy to understand. I recommend reading the FAQ before creating an account.
Verification email after registering takes about 15 minutes to arrive (the fault could be on my side though).
The button for opening the payment page (the one where you type the Euro amount, below that is a button "Continuer") does not work in Chrome (the ad- and cookie blockers I use could be the reason). It worked fine with Firefox.
Other than that it was smooth, it displayed a virtual CC info about 5 seconds after I sent the transaction (i.e. it didn't wait for a confirmation), and the CC payment was accepted by the hosting company. The overview page showed at first that the balance is available but after about 10 more seconds it showed that it's been used up.
Overall I am happy. The issues were minor and for me manageable (however, I'm a geek and my experience does not necessarily reflect the ability of a normal user to handle such issues). The issues are easy to fix. I personally plan to be using this service instead of a credit card for some of the spending I do, unless a better option arises.

No. There could be, among other things, "cluster of entrepreneurial errors" as it happens when the boom phase turns into the bust. The bad investments then need to be liquidated and re-priced before the capital goods can be used in productive ways.
You really should read upon the Austrian Business Cycle Theory.


This does not address my argument. Indeed there is no indication that you comprehend my objection.


First of all, the price of capital goods does not influence the price of everything else. It is the opposite.
Capital is not the money, rather capital are the goods that exist in the economy as a result of prior savings. [I explained this in an earlier blog post](
Furthermore, in order for the change of prices to lead to the problem you allege, it would need to adjust in a particular way, for example a linear one. You neglect that the change could also happen in a geometric proportion, depending on how far removed the capital good is from the consumption. This is the Austrian approach.
It might be more clear if you plot it on a graph, this is also why I would prefer a video conference as opposed to a telephone call, because I can prepare the charts and demonstrate the various models on them.


I've explained why your explanation is incorrect. The problem in the explanation is not really an economic one, it is a logical one.


Actually, it is not irrelevant, it explains why people participate in malinvestments even though they have the correct information: their economic position is unequal. People also participate in lotteries even thought the expected RoI is negative; they just think that they will be the lucky ones and the others will be the suckers.


The change in the money supply does not change the amount of capital goods. Therefore, this does not address my point.

I have been trying to form an opinion about attempts to advance Bitcoin-like systems futher (e.g. colored coins, protoshares, mastercoin, ethereum), however I think its premature to come to a conclusion. I did talk to Ron Gross (mastercoin) at the Amsterdam Conference in September 2013, among other things. I see that there are things on the protocol level that can be done better and in a more advanced fashion than Bitcoin, as well as these things might open up new opportunities. But we don't know in advance which combination of these features will be sufficiently important for people to actually adopt it. Maybe it is too early for something like this to catch on.
That doesn't however mean that people should not develop these systems. They should, because then when demand arises there will be a broader choice.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:48:35


Maybe instead you can familiarise yourself with the literature explaining the topic. Practically all that I say has been said by other people, most of them more knowledgeable than me in the topic.


It is a problem because whether an investment leads to satisfaction of consumer's needs is not determined by the nominal level of interest rate. A different monetary system does not make an investment correct merely because it appears nominally correct. If you change the monetary system in order to change the nominal interest rate, you will end up with malinvestments, investments that were done based on erroneous data.


Again, this argument is erroneous because whether such a venture would actually lead to satisfaction of needs does not depend on whether the system's nominal level of interest rate does or does not make it appear profitable.
What you should be asking is whether the system leads to correct investments, not more. Capital goods are scarce and they cannot be magically made to fulfill more needs because the nominal interest rate changes.


As I tried to explain (this is the "negative interest rate"), the price of capital goods is derived from the price of consumer goods. If a capital good is underutilised, it will be repriced in order to satisfy the needs. If instead you manipulate the interest rate, you end up with an investment that appears to be nominally correct but does not correspond to the time preference of the savers.
TLDR; you concentrate on the aggregate investment and ignore the structure of investment.


As I explained above, this is based on the erroneous asumptions.


This is an entirely different issue, as people do not choose the unit of account based on those criteria.

The main difference between what is possible with cryptocurrencies and how the current system works is decentralisation vs. hierarchies. The entry into provision of financial services is highly regulated, and one of the arguments for such a regulation is that if an intermediary has full control, there should be assurances about his reliability (I personally disagree but that's not the point here).
With Bitcoin, you can have specialist escrow agents that only deal in one area, wheras current payment systems are more of a one-size-fits-all. If in the current system you're unhappy, you need to escalate it to the courts, which is time consuming and costly. And even if entry to these areas becomes regulated, it is still difficult to enforce the regulation of auxiliary services, because for it to work, you don't need to depend on government-issued identification or courts in the first place. You can, to a certain extent, view cryptocurrencies as an alternative to the courts and police.
With respect to credit, I think that this is a controversial issue. I do not have a strong opinion, but I'll just point to a contrarian stance. It is possible that in a monetary system with secular falling price level, the relative weight of different methods of financing investments would be different than now and credit in the way we're used to would play a minor role. Rather than credit, there could be an increased investment by self-financing, bonds, shares or bills of exchange. This is how it was done in the past, the banking sector didn't play such a huge role. Prior to the advent of fiat money, credit financing was mostly to monarchs and consumer credit to the poor, rather than for businesses. As an introduction, check out [this recent article](
Of course, nowadays, issuance of bonds or shares is heavily regulated and banking is hierarchical, so we shouldn't wonder too much that there is a certain level of interdependency among the factors here. Heck, here in Austria, crowdfunding is illegal **for the investors**, but a I heard there is a reform pending which should fix it.
Even nowadays, there are differences in how credit is used. In the US, most card payments are credit cards. Here in Europe, most card payments are debit cards and many PoS systems wouldn't take a credit card anyway and you'd have to take cash out of ATM instead. The financing of businesses in Europe relies more heavily on bank supplied credit, whereas in the US you have a larger involvement of VCs.

Well, whether the mining would be able to resist a government attack we don't know. Maybe there are better ways of achieving that, Bitcoin was just the first one to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem.

I understand your arguments. Maybe then a bit of background on me.
Since last year (around April I think), I do Bitcoin full time, so if I was to be entirely impartial I would have no income. On the other hand, if I decided to have a different type of income, I couldn't do Bitcoin full time. I tried that when I started researching Bitcoin and it did work for a while but then it got too time consuming to do as a hobby, and I couldn't concentrate on my day job properly so I quit. Even though at that time I had no idea how I'd earn money.
My thesis advisor taught me how to improve my impartiality, so I try to uphold it. For example I typically do not inject my anarchocapitalist normatives into my posts, and try to separate the normative and the positive. While Rothbard said (paraphrasing) that you're not really an anarchist unless you hate the state, I argue that it is not necessary to make your argument depend on hating the state. Not only is it better from scientific point of view, but a lot of people have emotional attachments to the state and get extremely agitated and it would hinder a debate. I can thus have a debate both with fellow anarchists as well as government employees.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:24:43
I explain this in the linked article. Investing into in a ponzi scheme gives you a legal right for future income produced by the scheme, i.e. a "share" of the scheme is a claim on other people participating in the scheme. The profit is generated through the leverage effect.
Buying Bitcoin gives you no right to any income. Indeed there is no income and neither is there any leverage. You need to re-sell Bitcoin to profit on the appreciation.

I also have a more recent paper with more focus: 
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:18:16
I'll turn this around. Forex volume is prerequisite for international trade if countries have their own currencies, not a consequence thereof. Similarly, trading stocks and gold for fiat is a prerequisite for them being used as a medium of exchange. And btc/fiat exchanges are a prerequisite for using Bitcoin as either a payment mechanism or a medium of exchange.
Unless there are closed-loops for using Bitcoin as both a payment mechanism and a store of liquidity (medium of exchange) simultaneously, it is expected that the btc/fiat volume would be much larger.
It's not that the larger volume of btc/fiat should be a consequence of Bitcoin being used for trading goods and services, rather it is a prerequisite for it. The volume of trades against goods/services can be thus in my opinion a misleading indicator. Maybe it's ok, maybe it's not.
Furthermore, as I argue in a yet-unpublished paper (but I think I made those arguments elsewhere online too), the expectation that Bitcoin will appreciate does not contradict the expectation that Bitcoin will be liquid. These two can occur simultaneously. This is why it's difficult to argue that the speculation is a problem. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

Sorry for the late reaction, I have a backlog.
As someone who also wrote a paper about Bitcoin in academic framework, let me give you some tips.
Organisational: a good tutor will assist you in finding material relevant for your paper, and with scientific writing. Also, the paper should be evaluated based on how well it's argued, not whether the tutor agrees with you.
Topical: Bitcoin is macroeconomically irrelevant and will probably stay that way for a long time (possibly forever). However, there are several areas where macroeconomic approach might be helpful.
The first one is investigating the transformative stage that precedes Bitcoin becoming money (the term typically used in such a case is "dollarisation"). There has been work done in this area, for example Eduardo Levy-Yeyati. Start there and work through other papers he quotes.
The second one is the monetary policy in the world of Bitcoin. Here you have the option of analysing what can the central banks do in such a case, or what it would be like without central banks, or even what alternative models exist. There are plenty of alternative proposals to the system we have now. There are the freebankers, "gold standard"-Austrians, complementary currency movement, systems like those presented by Fama/Black/Hall, MMT, positive money movement, and many more that I forgot. You can probably pick one that you find interesting and perhaps come up with a suggestion how such a policy could be implemented in a blockchain-based system.
I'd also like to point you to the [Zotero group "Economics of Bitcoin"]( which is run by me, and contains references to hundreds of sources that I read and that are helpful in academic research. I don't update it that frequently, but maybe I'll find time again soon.

TLDR; He's a statist fanatic and derives his writings from this fanaticism.
The US constitution describes the rights and obligations of the government, not of private persons. In particular the Article 1 he refers to describes the rights an obligations of the Congress. If he wants to have a constitutional ban on Bitcoin, he needs to pass an amendment.
But never mind that. In order for Bitcoin to win it cannot submit itself to the statist law, but rather work even in hostile legislative environment. Rather than being incorporated into the statist legal system, cryptocurrencies would have to replace it. Whether it is legal or illegal to use them is of secondary importance. We'll see how it turns out in Russia.

Fiat money also primarily trades against other money rather than goods/services. Forex markets are the most liquid ones in the world, with about 5 trillion USD daily volume. In other words, it looks like this is actually normal, and thus not a valid objection to Bitcoin.

are you planning to go to any Bitcoin conferences, maybe we can do the debate there?
I think however that I have to postpone our debate for the time being. We seem to only disagree on one thing, the evolution of interest rates in a deflationary economy. There's this guy:  who wrote extensively against Bitcoin, among other things also this argument that you're bringing up. He agreed to a debate with me. I'm gathering material to write a long post where I address his points, and that's a lot of work. Also your point will be one of those that I'll address. I'm sorry if this does not satisfy you, but this is just one of the points and it fits nicely into the whole narrative that I want to prepare regarding deflation.
If you still would like to debate afterwards, I'm sure we can arrange something. Maybe since you have a problem with the internet connection, each of us can record a video of themselves and put it on youtube? I could get you a good microphone/webcam for that. That doesn't require that you have a connection for videoconferencing. If you want that, how about you go on amazon or anything that ships into Portugal and is supported by snapcard, let me know which product you want just so that I can check you're not buying something ridiculously expensive, and once we both agree you can order it and send me the payment link, ok?
@_date: 2014-02-07 08:58:30
That depends on who you ask. The Austrian school of economics thinks deflation is (or at least can be) beneficial.
Think of it this way. During its lifetime, Bitcoin appreciated by a factor of almost a million (it's falling at the moment so it's slightly less now). Is the bitcoin economy as a result of this "not good"?

What you present is a false dichotomy: either you have a risk and accept immediately, or wait 10 minutes and have no risk.
The real issue is more complicated and the type of risks that arise due to how blockchain works is a new type of phenomenon that we are not accustomed to. It is more fuzzy, but also more antifragile. It will take time to create a user friendly method to allow normal users to handle this risk.
In the worst case, you can still use a more sophisticated way of avoiding this, e.g. through collateral or using a trusted third party.
Bitcoin does not need to be perfect to succeed, it just needs to be better than all the other alternatives.

The return code of 550 should cause the sending email server to generate a bounce. According to wikipedia, this is the correct behaviour:  . 
The reason I don't want the service to generate new email message (pseudo-bounce) myself is that I think that may exacerbate rather than solve spam. I realise that there is a tradeoff.

This is a misinterpretation of mainstream economics. Mainstreamists such as Krugman do not argue that a deflationary currency would fail, but that it would be bad for the economy. These are two separate arguments.
Similarly, regarding gold standard, it's not like people didn't want to use gold-backed money, but that economists and politicians argued it's bad for the economy and through a series of defaults and broken legal obligations they replaced gold-backed currencies with fiat. This can't happen with Bitcoin, because it can exist in paper and digital form without financial instruments, so there is no promise to break.
Furthermore, as I've been arguing for a long time, and finally even [Joe Weisenthal gets it]( the actual mainstream economic argument against deflation depends on the unit of account function, rather than an appreciation of a medium of exchange. And even as a fan of Bitcoin [I'm still unclear about whether Bitcoin can overcome that hurdle](
The more naive argument that people wouldn't spend an appreciating medium of exchange is easily refuted because it contradicts empirical data.
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:33:13
Don't invest :-). The reason to hold a medium of exchange is for its liquidity services, not because of its stable price. There is also the difference in transaction costs between cryptocurrencies and fiat.
But I see how some people might be discouraged by the fluctuating price. It is also a matter of your attitude to risk.

As an economist who's been researching this, let me reply.
Bitcoin supports multi-signature transactions. This means that you can delegate escrow functionality (or in general any other functionality) to third parties who do not need to be fully trusted. For an overview I recommend [this article by Vitalik Buterin](
For financial instruments, there are also multiple options, for example [OpenTransactions]( or [Ripple]( You can implement all kinds of transactions similar to those you list.
Bitcoin itself already allows some transactions which previously required a trusted third party to be without one (either entirely without a third party or without one that you need to fully trust). Using the game theory allows to create contractual agreements which are unprofitable to violate for both parties (e.g. violating it results in the loss of collateral).
As far as I know, these are still at a relatively immature stage, but some examples exist. For example, [mycelium local trader]( which launched earlier this year, uses multisig escrow without a third party.

This is a good question. First of all, I'll assume you're referring to the situation in the USA.
In it's guidance FIN-2014-R001, FinCEN wrote this:
"A user’s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter."
"However, a user wishing to purchase goods or services with Bitcoin it has mined, which pays the Bitcoin **to a third party at the direction of a seller or creditor**, may be engaged in money transmission."

You're mixing credit with fiduciary media. Those are not the same thing. Only fiduciary media expand the money supply, mere credit does not. Fiduciary media are unlikely to occur with Bitcoin.

That sounds unlikely, Gox has for over a year been refusing to give Bitcoinica's liquidators access to the company account, in fact there were recently started efforts to sue Gox for this reason and Roger was on board with that.

I understand your point alright. There are both pros and cons. I personally prefer a hands on approach when I try stuff myself. I ordered bitbills and casascius coins for example when they were first announced and I got first batches. I tried almost everything related to Bitcoin, but I didn't buy any drugs (I'm not sure whether an explanation that this was done for research pursposes is legally relevant) and I didn't use any of the adult services (my wife would object).
The skin-in-the-game argument is more like "if you object to Bitcoin then short sell".
I understand that it's difficult to avoid using fiat. I just wanted to point out that this automatically creates a bias. I prefer to be aware of the exposure to bias, rather than avoiding exposure.

I'm not a keynesian, but have been trying to understand their point so I'll give it a shot. Hoarded money (money not deposited into a bank), according to my understanding of keynesianism, causes a decrease in investment (because it can't be loaned to businesses) and this creases a necessity for monetary intervention to compensate for this, otherwise the economy would suffer. It is thus better to prevent this at all by penalising "hoarding" and motivating depositing money into the bank.
Now, Austrians would disagree with this interpretation and I think even without some Austrian assumptions this argument is problematic, but nevertheless I think this what the keynesians think.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:03:50
That's a good question. I think Bitcoin will evolve along the path of reduction of transaction costs. For example online payments and countries with a high proportion of underbanked first.

I used them six times already and have a seventh one booked, all over the world (South and North America, Asia, Europe). I also met their CEO Martin and their China Country Manager Wei at a conference earlier this month. I only had one actual problem, the user interface didn't select the correct flights, but they fixed the booking when I sent them an email.
In general, their website only does the ordering process, the rest you need to do over email. And if you want to select seats or food for example, you have to contact the airline directly. However, BTCtrip are very responsive and give you the correct information and all the questions and wishes I had were always resolved. Once I was confused about the booking code as well, however it turned out it was for the other airline (when changing planes, more than one airline might be involved), BTCtrip will tell you what exactly you need to do. The airline should recognise the e-ticket number even if the booking code is for the other airline, just contact the airline by phone.

Well, you could use bitcoin-core in daemon mode and a walletnotify script to notify you by your preferred method. For populating the addresses, use a small program to generate the addresses from xpub and then use the importaddress bitcoin-core api (with parameter 3 set to false) to tell it which addresses to wach.
I did this for the payment part of my mailchuck project and it seems to work (but hasn't been released yet). I use pybitcointools to generate addresses from xpub (works for electrum public seeds as well, just different options are passed). It wasn't that difficult to write, it took much longer to figure out what components to use.
Here is are code excerpts that you can reuse:
    if masterpubkey[0:4] == "xpub":
        # BIP44
        dpk1 = pybitcointools.bip32_ckd(masterpubkey, 0)
        dpk2 = pybitcointools.bip32_ckd(dpk1, offset)
        pubkey = pybitcointools.bip32_extract_key(dpk2)
    else:
        # Electrum
        pubkey = pybitcointools.electrum_pubkey(masterpubkey, offset)
    address = pybitcointools.pubkey_to_address(pubkey)
    bitcoinrpc = jsonrpclib.Server(' +
        username + ":" +
        password + " +
        host + ":" +
        str(port)) + "/")
    # returns null on success
    rpcreply = bitcoinrpc.importaddress(address, "", False)
and then the walletnotify code:
    txid = sys.argv[1]
    client = jsonrpclib.Server(' + cfg['rpcuser'] + ":" + cfg['rpcpassword'] + " + cfg['rpcconnect'] + ":" + str(cfg['rpcport']) + "/")
    txinfo = client.gettransaction(txid, True)
    for detail in txinfo['details']:
        if detail['category'] == "receive":
                print detail['address'] + " -&gt; " + str(detail['amount'])
I used python because that seems to have the most library code available, you can use a different language but based on my research it will take more time (with the possible exception of java, if you're familiar with java you'll be able to find code for that too, but I don't like java).

First of all, value only arises when goods are put into some connection to satisfaction of human needs. A good iself without any people that relate to it has no value.
There are plenty of goods that only have value because trade exists. Let's take a retail shop. If people didn't trade, a retail shop would be useless.
It seems to confuse some people that Bitcoin itself is traded and valued during the transaction. But this is a metaphysical objection rather than an economic one. It just works better this way in this particular case, becuase Bitcoin is not merely a good but a protocol too. All protocols, including less formal one such as human languages, only have value due to the network effect, i.e. if only one person uses them they are practically useless.
Regarding cloning, it also does not work because there are other factors. For media of exchange, this is to a large extent liquidity. A clone of Bitcoin has a different liquidity than Bitcoin, so it has a different capacity to satisfy needs. Just like if noone spoke English, it would be useless, at least at the beginning. There are invented languages such as Klingon or Sindarin. They don't really compete with English, but they nevertheless exist and have utility.

I disagree with the conclusion, because we see plenty of media of exchange that are not money (e.g. precious commodities, stocks, bonds, debt of reputable institutions). People have found out how to increase the liquidity of goods, so we actually see the number of media of exchange increase over time. The only necessary condition for something to be a medium of exchange is that it is liquid. With respect to other factors, media of exchange differ, so other types of demand than liquidity can be satisfied by them and thus they can coexist. I treat this a bit in [my latest paper](
The question whether there will be multiple media of exchange should however be distinguished from the question whether there will be multiple unit of account standards (other than differences across jurisdictions). This appears to me unlikely, but I haven't written about this extensively yet.

There is a good reason why Bitcoin cannot be a pyramid scheme: a holder of a Bitcoin has no claim against other people. It's not a financial instrument but a good (with a bit of exaggeration we could say a commodity). So similarly as beanie babies can't be a ponzi scheme, Bitcoin cannot be a ponzi scheme either. [I explain this in one of my blog posts]( and there is also a yet-unpublished paper which is a bit more academic on this.
That however does not mean that you can't lose money on it, or that it is not possible to perform a pump-and-dump with it. You can lose money and you can, at least theoretically, pump-and-dump Bitcoin. But that is true of almost anything that has a relatively small trade volume and can be exchanged quickly.

I think you're missing the obvious. The practical problem is not the GST charged on the sale of goods and services that are paid with bitcoins. The problem is the GST charged on the sale of bitcoins against fiat (such as AUD) or other goods and services (bartering). The same problem exists in large parts of Europe.
This affects situations where a private person (or a non-GST-registered business) obtains bitcoins from a GST registered business. If you operate a bitcoin ATM in Australia, for example, according to the guidance the tax office expects you to pay 10% of the sales (rather than just the fees) as tax. Which means that the user of the ATM can expect to pay a 10% markup unless the operator makes losses or does not report to the tax office. The threshold for GST registration is 75.000 AUD per year, which an ATM can do easily.
If you're a private person and buy bitcoins from abroad (such as on an exchange), you probably need to pay a 10% import tax. If you don't, that makes you a tax evader. As far as I understand, there is no requirement for the seller to be GST-registered. There may be an exception for small amounts like it is in Europe (I don't know the Australian specifics).
I would not call myself a tax expert, I'm more an economist, but I did a fair deal of research (and also have practical experience) so I'd say my analysis is sound. I was also [quoted by Coindesk]( when a similar guidance was issued in Austria.
**update**: I briefly read the official ATO publication and it seems to support my analysis, at least partially. They mention the necessity to pay tax on the sales done through an ATM or an exchange. They did not specifically address the import issue. There is a 10.000 AUD threshold with respect to capital gains tax, but they did not mention any exception for imports.

The third option that you're neglecting is that the fact that investment would not happen has other reasons (e.g. it has a wrong price, or it would be used to satisfy other needs). I tried to explain that irrespective of the monetary model you have, it canot lead to the situation you describe, becase the price of capital goods is derived from the price of consumer goods. Apparently it is too difficult to comprehend this.
Let me put that into a more abstract form so that the logical component of the fallacy is apparent. You claim that A leads to X, therefore we need to reject A and institute B instead. B would lead to X', and X' is preferable to X.
My counter is that A does not lead to X, therefore replacing A with B does not necessarily lead to X'. If we really do observe X, it must have a different explanation that A.
Your counter is that X' is preferable to X, therefore B is preferable to A. But this in no way addressed my argument. X is not the consequence of A.
Or let me put it differently. If in a deflationary monetary system you have really have such a scenario where an investment is not made on account of RoI being smaller than the expected rate of deflation, it must logically have a different cause than the rate of deflation as such. And since the rate of deflation is not the cause of this decision, changing the monetary system to an inflationary one would not be fixing a problem. Instead, if the investors did really change their behaviour on account of a change of the rate of inflation alone, they would be creating rather than fixing a problem.


Again the false dichotomy. You ignore the unseen.


No, it does not, you ignore the Cantillon effect.


I do understand your argument. I have encountered it before, and I researched it before. I actually talked about it in my presentation at Bitcoin 2012 in London. You do not understand my argument and did not address it at all. You think that merely because you can imagine a situation where a comparison of expected RoI and rate of deflation makes an investment appear unprofitable, this means there is a causal link between the rate of inflation and this unprofitability. This is not true. As the price of capital goods is derived from the price of consumer goods, if such an unprofitable scenario indeed appears, it would have to have a different cause than the rate of deflation.

As I explained [in an earlier post on my blog]( the historical examples of "deflationary spirals" could be ascribed to the unit of account function and cyclical credit contraction. You need to eliminate these two factors in order to make a persuasive argument.

Of course, there is very little code that I had to write in the first place and I'm not a UI designer. Even though from UI perspective there isn't much that I can screw up. Once everything is running, I plan to pay someone to do a better UI.
Main point is it works, can be used by anyone and I can't track who is the payer or payee because that is not transmitted to the server (the main goal of mailchuck is privacy, so sometimes this comes at the expense of usability). The code is just html and javascript so you can download it and experiment on your own.

I have this feature in  I tested it but it hasn't been turned on for any real user yet. If you want to try it, get in touch with me. It works exactly as you want, address generation from user supplied seed, compatible with either BIP44 or electrum seed. User can specify the amount as well, you can specify it in BTC, USD, EUR or GBP, the exchange rate is determined at the time the payment request is generated using Coindesk BPI.
On technical level, the payment part uses a milter to check whether payment is required and then does a reject on SMTP level with a return code 550.
Mailchuck's primary goal is privacy, so it uses Bitmessage as a delivery system for email contents, so you don't need to expose your identity to me. The sender/recipient payment pairings are stored as a salted hash. The third party sender payment UI is fully generated on the client side (e.g.  so I don't know who's paying for what. And the payment UI can be used by anyone entirely unrelated to mailchuck, so that's an additional identity obscuring vector.

I agree that this might escalate into an actual issue. About two years ago, in the [Discussion part of Scalability article on Bitcoin Wiki]( I made some estimates about how Moore's law might compensate for this. My conclusion was that by 2027 Moore's law should allow Bitcoin as it is now to scale so that a casual user can run a full archiving node at "VISA speed". The bottleneck appears to be bandwidth.
But maybe I was too pessimistic. People who want to run a full node can rent a server in a datacenter, and that gets more than average bandwidth. Other people can run a SPV client.

I challenge you to post a quote from either side as an example of your argument, and I'll explain to you where in the quote the conservative/progressive affinity is.
For example, Satoshi's sentence (well 2 sentences) "They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
[Eric Lombrozo argues]( that it means, paraphrased, out of two chains adhering to the same ruleset, the miners pick one that is longer. [Andrew Stone, BU Lead Dev argues]( that it means, again paraphrased, out of two mutually exclusive rulesets, miners pick whichever ruleset they prefer.
Libertarianism doesn't accurately map to the conservative/progressive affinity, rather it maps to the collectivist/individualist axis. There are anarchocapitalists on both sides.

The unit of account function is, in my opinion, the final step of the spread of a medium of exchange, it occurs at a very late stage. A less liquid medium of exchange has a higher bid-ask spread and is less suitable as a unit of account. In addition to that, central banks, tax offices and other state institutions have a lot of power over what is used as a unit of account (e.g. taxation penalises other units of account).
A typical business thus has little practical reasons to use Bitcoin as a UoA. Now, in the non-profit Bitcoin Austria, the treasurer told me we use Bitcoin as a unit for bookkeeping. But the membership fees are still adjusted occasionally based on the exchange rate of BTC/EUR.
I do not expect people to switch to Bitcoin as UoA until the dollar and euro already collapsed or are about to collapse, and even then it's not clear (they might switch to gold or SDR as UoA instead).

In the bitcoin case, it was irrelevant whether someone "stole value" or not. In the DAO case, that's the core of the disagreement.


The effect is relative change in the purchasing power of all the holders of money. However, this happens in ALL increases in the supply of money, not merely those that happen through credit expansion or fiat money printing. It also happens when a miner mines gold, for example. But the fiat money printing and credit expansion have additional effects (for example certain types of credit expansion cause the business cycle), and these are the core of Austrian critiques, not the increase in the money supply per se.


Except there is a disagreement on whether this "bug in the code" is a part of the consensus or not (also ether cannot be owned but that's not that important at the moment). Whose interpretation of a contract is the legally relevant one?
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:40:01


This is a value judgement. Ethereum is designed to allow users to create and destroy tokens.


You cannot steal value. That is nonsense. See:

The problem was that **nobody** should have them rather than a particular person like with the ether.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:08:18


This argument would make be consistent if you didn't object to the perpetrator keeping the ether. You do not merely want to adjust the DAO tokens cap, but also to change the allocation of ether. Indeed the cause of anger of the participants in the issue is the allocation of ether, not the amount of DAO tokens. You're the first one that even mentioned it to me.


The Austrians define inflation based on the increase in the money supply rather than stealing of value. The objections towards some types of inflation, depending on the point of view, they base on a violation of property rights (e.g. fraud) from legal perspective, and the relative changes in the purchasing power through the Cantillon effect from economic perspective. But all increases in the money supply are subject to the Cantillon effect (increasing the production of specie for example as well), not merely those that involve fraud.
The DAO exploit did not involve a violation of property rights from Austrian perspective. Ether and DAO tokens are not an object of property rights, and there was no trespassing, burglary or unauthorised use of computers. If you think that the exploit violated your property rights, you can always sue the perpetrator in court, rather than force others who are affected by the exploit to bend to your normative framework.

The position that Gox was not running on the bitcoin blockchain while DAO was running on ethereum blockchain is a subjective assessment. There is a wide disagreement about such a distinction and a consensus is absent. It's not that I see it in a particular way, it's that the ethereum community doesn't have an agreement.
It's the same issue as with the Bitcoin block size: one part of the community thinks that the blocksize is a part of the consensus, and other part thinks it's not. One part thinks that a bitcoin with a higher blocksize than bitcoin core's default is an altcoin, the other thinks it's a bugfix.
One part of the ethereum community thinks that rollback of DAO is an altcoin, and other part thinks that it's bugfix.
So ethereum now has the same conflict as Bitcoin, despite supposedly being better prepared by having a more formal governance structure. The cause is a clash of values rather than governance.
However, even the majority of the opponents of the blocksize increase want to increase it eventually, they just want to do it more conservatively (the only exception I know of being Luke-Jr). So with Bitcoin, the clash is more of a quantitative rather than qualitative nature. Ethereum is in a much worse conundrum: no matter what choice is met (and these choices are mutually exclusive), part of the community will be alienated forever.
I'm sorry but I think this blow to ethereum is much harder than it appears.

I found the shop on the evening of 30th and it had a guy inside setting it up, the picture is from 31st because I wanted daylight and by that time there wasn't anyone inside. In the picture taken in the evening the "The House of Nakamoto" sign wasn't readable. I also took like 10 pictures because I wanted one without people walking in front of it so that the shop is fully visible. Maybe half of the people who walk around at least glanced inside looking puzzled. I think the location is excellent. While the "Sexworld und Spartacus" that's next to it is normal for that area, this is a 1.8 km long shopping street that basically has all types of shops and this particular one is right next to a subway exit. You can see the stone wall of the exit at the bottom of the picture, and at the very bottom left the thin black stripe is the hand rail of the escalator. Plenty of people will see it every day, all day and night long.
I asked the guy some questions and one of them was exactly this (business model / funding / longevity). I'm confident there will be some sort of official announcement and other PR including details when it officially opens. I was told that the shop has been founded by a German businessman who wants to promote Bitcoin and even if it isn't profitable, it will be worth it. I forgot his name but I had never heard it before. There are other people participating, some are known in the Austrian Bitcoin community.
Among other things, they have a 2-way Bitcoin ATM, the first in Austria (there have only been 1-ways so far), which is visible on the bottom right. I think it's a Lamassu but don't remember exactly. He said that they sorted the regulation by limiting single trades to 250 EUR.
They also plan selling Bitcoin related stuff like hardware wallets, have a library about Bitcoin and the Austrian School of Economics and run events (the whole first floor also belongs to the shop, it's outside of the picture boundaries).

This is very interesting. For comparison, these complications don't exist with Bitmessage. Mempool objects have explicit expiration, mempool is flushed to disk and RAM is just used as a cache (although this is more of an implementation than design issue), there are no interdependencies among objects in mempool, there is no scripting language to influence validity check complexity. There still were a couple of minor adjustments I had to make (e.g. what to do when a new object is created while there are no outbound connections) and it took a while to get rid of bugs, but with the current code in PyBitmessage  it seems to be working ok.

These points are to a large extent unrelated to each other and indicate that he has made up his opinion and does not want to change it. For example, a pump and dump does not imply that it's a scam, and a scam does not imply that it will fail. There are pump and dumps done with things which are broadly accepted as legitimate, and there are scams which continue for decades if not centuries. It works the other way around too, there are non-scams which fail just as well.
Other things just do not even connect to each other. For example point 7. Deanonymising has nothing to do with how powerful computers are, but how much data the adversary collects.
In general, a lot of the issues mentioned are empirical ones, you can't say it's entirely one way or another or which direction it will evolve. For example, regarding point 12: you can probably persuade someone that something which is not a bitcoin is a bitcoin. But the costs of verifying the authenticity of bitcoin are very low and do not require special contractual obligations, special hardware or skills. Unlike, for example, your bank account balance (which the bank can set arbitrarily and you have no way to audit it), cash or gold coins, which require special equipment to check and is not easily portable. The authenticity of a bitcoin you can verify with your mobile phone, for example.
Some claims are empirically false. For example, after it was announced that Silk Road 1.0 was shut down by the FBI, the price went up dramatically and it is still higher than at that time.
The point of bitcoin is not primarily anonymity or "currency". It is about the ability to enforce contractual obligations. Some others may say it's about uncensorability (which is a different way of saying the same thing). The "currency" and pseudonymity are just a bonus.

I would say that it is the modern right wing rather than classic right wing. Classic right wing didn't oppose private investment into security, like guns, safes, locks. These also make it more difficult for police to execute their tasks. Sadly, the belief in central planning seems to be more and more present in public discourse.
An analogy would be something like this: people discover stainless steel and start producing lockpicks (let's assume that normal iron is too soft or rusts too quickly for lockpicks to be produced). The statist ideologue would say: we should ban lockpicks, because it exposes the house owners to burglary, and since people can buy lockpicks anonymously, it makes the job of police more difficult. Of course, that's just an ideological approach that promotes inefficient security (by having locks that are easy to crack), and socialises the costs thereof.
If you do not believe in central planning, then the whole position of Neil Stevens (the author of the linked article) becomes absurd: even if Bitcoin posed a problem, Neil's proposal wouldn't fix it. If on the other hand you do believe in central planning, the it sounds very logical.

First of all, the technical symptoms you describe are normal when running a bitcoin node. So per se, there is no technical problem.
Purely from terminological point of view it could be argued that bitcoin is a botnet. It just isn't a malicious one. Consult your internal company policy documents what you are and aren't allowed to do. If it does not give you a clear answer, ask your IT guys. You can ask, for example:
- how is it interfering with their or other employees' jobs
- if there are particular settings you should be using
It may help if there was a work-related purpose for running a full bitcoin node. You do not explain why you're running it at work or what kind of work it is.

TLDR (points I found relevant) translated from German (the original language) to English:
**EDIT: fixed "judge" and some minor terms**
- the Advocate General, Juliane Kokott, argued that Bitcoin is used only as a medium of exchange (maybe "means of payment" is a more correct translation), its sale is not a delivery of a good or service and therefore the sale is not subject to VAT
- there are discrepancies in the exact wordings in national laws with respect to how VAT-exemption applies to currency exchange. German law, for example, requires that in order to be VAT exempt, both currencies must be national currencies. Other countries have different and often more relaxed requirements.
- Kokott concluded that because the exchange of national currency into a non-national currency (for a fee) is not sufficiently different from the exchange of national currency into another national currency (for a fee), it is also a financial service and the service provider fee is VAT exempt. Also, she thinks that the purpose of this particular VAT exemption is to help make international payments smooth. Kokott also said with respect to the arguments of German representatives (that Bitcoin is volatile and risky), that this is irrelevant, that this is an issue of financial market regulation and not VAT.
- Bitcoin itself is not a claim on something (as would a demand deposit be), so the exemptions in this area do not apply if you trade bitcoins (the wording seems to imply that the exemption may apply if you were trading claims on bitcoins)
This was not a ruling, rather it was a "final opinion" and a recommendation for the court decision. There are still steps that need to happen for this to be legally binding.
In summary, for practical purposes with respect to VAT, Bitcoin trades and the provision thereof should be treated the same as national currencies.

It depends on whether this would target middlemen or everyone. If just middlemen, then people could switch to open source solutions. But even then it would be difficult to enforce. Everyone in the whole world who had a web server or email server that potentially has clients in UK would be need to enforce against (like BitLicense in NY but even stupider). And it would clash with other laws, such as data protection regulation, financial regulation or the eSignature directive.
If everyone, then don't move there.

It is more complicated than that.

For an intermediate step, register on advcash.com and top up with bitcoin, or get a prepaid card in a different EU country and top that up with cashila.com or other similar bitcoin-to-SEPA service. Most of the online sites I tried it with worked with advcash (Bing Ads being the only exception I found so far). Paypal, for example, works fine with advcash's virtual card.
As an answer to why not more sites accept bitcoin, I did marketing research 2 years ago, and the top issue was integration with accounting. As someone who also takes bitcoin payments, implements it in software and does accounting, I have the same opinion. It's not a technical issue. Accounting software does not know about bitcoin, and if it did, in most countries they cannot handle it exactly the same way as a foreign currency.
That being said, the merchant service providers that are available with bitcoin make it easier to some extent, in particular if they allow you to export accounting data and do fiat settlement. There are other solutions that specialise in accounting of bitcoin-only transactions, but I think a normal merchant will want something that integrates into whatever they already use rather than a separate package.
So my recommendation is to look at what providers are available in that country, if they integrate with the merchant's software, and recommend that payment processor, not bitcoin as such.
@_date: 2015-07-24 19:39:45
In that case probably go with an existing payment processor and a API/library they provide [like the coinbase one just mentioned](

Banks belonging to the Raiffeisen Group (not only in Austria but in other countries too) have had this policy for a while, maybe a year. It was reported in this subreddit, and one of their AML guys I spoke to at a conference confirmed it. Earlier this year, there was a post in this subreddit that they will allow small amounts.
I have no information about other banks in Austria having similar policies, but they probably monitor it and report suspicious transactions. Try a bank belonging to a different group. Or, trade locally in cash.
I agree with you that the more banks restrict you, the less motivation is there to use them. Banks suffer from the "Innovator's Dilemma", but also they are in the middle of a conflict of stakeholders (regulators vs. customers).
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:18:39
This is a complicated topic, and the law enforcement themselves do not always know the correct answer either. Increasingly, it looks like merely buying or selling bitcoins for yourself is probably not considered money transmission. Perhaps with the BitLicense, in New York you may require a license for this, but if I understand it correctly, on federal level you wouldn't need one. If you're trading for speculation, if you're a using it just for payments, if you're not providing custodial accounts, if you're not doing it for profit, it may not be money transmission either.
Coinbase has several services: you can buy bitcoins from them, they can provide you with merchant services, and they run an exchange. As far as I understand, the first one isn't money transmission, but the other two are.
Of course, I could be wrong about this.

The criticism of xpub is only partially true. With BIP44, you can have an arbitrary number of separate sequences. In Mycelium wallet, for example, if you create an additional HD account, that will simply start a new sequence at a different part of the tree. So you can add a new "HD account" for a specific purpose, like bitwage. I did the same thing for my service,  and this is also possible for my users who use the "charge senders for emails" option. This is why things like BIP44 exist.

Also, for a more general approach, there is a [bitcoin URI standard]( I don't know how it is on iOS, but on Android, a wallet can register this URI standard and then when your app generates a request like that, android will automatically call the wallet with the appropriate payment request. But you still need something on your end to generate the URI and to process the incoming payment.

I wonder if you understand how fractional reserve system works. If you have a demand deposit account, it's not your money. It's the money bank owes you. If the banks don't have enough liquidity (which can happen in any system that transforms maturity)
to satisfy either withdrawals or transfers, you have several options, mainly:
* bail in
* bail out
* monetary reform
* bankruptcy
The point is, someone has to pay for the bad debt, the question is who. There is no "good" solution. The good solution would have been not to go borrow and not to lend. It's too late for that. The issue is further exacerbated by a high level of interdependence, to a certain extent all stakeholders might end up on the losing side.
Think of it like the Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox, except worse. While the Gox coins still might be located and returned one day, the bank deposits literally are never there.
To me, the moral of the story is, don't use fiat and don't lend your money unless you're willing to take the risk. I'm saddened by the situation in Greece, but people need to realise this source of the problem is not specific to Greece, it can happen in any country. And once it happens, it's already too late.

What I would try to check first is if they have a license based on the EU Payment Systems Directive (Cashila, for example, has a license from the Czech regulator). I tried to look at the website of the Dutch regulator, but couldn't find bitbill or shopem on the list. However, it could be that there's something wrong with their website, because I also searched for Bitpay and it doesn't find them either (in the past, I spoke with Bitpay and they told me they do have a license from the Dutch regulator). Or it could be they are licensed in a different country, because EU country regulators recognise each others' licenses with respect to the PSD.

Actually you didn't address them, you did the exact same thing I objected to: you implied that merely because something happens on your computer you don't like afterwards, that means it's "unauthorised" and "disruption" and "illegal". These assumptions are quite far fetched.
I have seen complaints where people accused others on a network I was managing of "hacking" because they tried to connect to a random port on their machine (a leftover of the destination IP being a part of a P2P network in my opinion) and they had a firewall that generated overly dramatic warnings. I told them they were stupid. I hate arrogant stupid people. That was over a decade ago, nowadays I would probably be more diplomatic, but needless to say there was nothing illegal about it before or now.
All kinds of undesired behaviour can happen on a computer caused by others. You can run of out disk space when you download too much and don't pay attention where you're clicking. You can have crap installed even though it explicitly asks you if you agree with the installation. Your browser can crash or overload your CPU or memory when you visit a website that is too big or the renderer has a bug. Your bitcoin node can overload even now if you run it on an underpowered machine. That's not what the Computer Misuse Act addresses.

In the case of email, convention has evolved for guidelines to distinguish between an "unauthorised" DoS and "authorised" emails. Similarly the analogy that was used in that case, walking on a private path to someone's door. Also in that particular case, the sender was spoofing the sender address, which again based on convention is not something that is seen as normal.
In case of coinwallet or the overly dramatic firewall in my example, no such convention exists. This is also why you filing a complaint against someone merely because your browser crashes or you run out of diskspace when being online is unlikely to result in a conviction. On the other hand, in case of the "xt node attackers", this appears to be a solid UDP flood, and there a convention exists.

Since I have been playing with bitcoin payments for other features, I have been thinking about adding such a functionality (sending invoices to third parties on behalf of the user) to my service,  . It's not entirely without a company then, but probably as close as you can get. It uses HD wallets so all the money goes to the user, and it tries to know as little as possible about the parties involved (the user only communicates over bitmessage, and the third-party UI generates contents at the client side).
Before launching, the source will go public too so if you're so inclined you can run it yourself.
prototype of third-party-facing UI:
If you are only interested with presenting your customers with a payment UI, you can use it without any contractual requirements, because as I said it's generated at the client, so you can put whatever you want into the invoice.

There are many wallets with different advantages and disadvantages. For example, having the full blockchain can be better for privacy, but it requires you to have enough disk space.
Since you do not want to have the full blockchain, you have to use a wallet that does not use full validation, but simplified (SPV) or a third-party validation. There are online guides which will help you decide a suitable wallet for you, for example this one:

First of all, I'm not a tax advisor so i may be wrong.
I don't think that if you are not running a business, you are required to keep records of your transactions. The tax office may estimate your taxes to your disadvantage in such a case, but you're not violating any laws.
Even if the tax office decides to investigate you and you cannot provide records, they still need some basis to make their own estimates of how much taxes you owe. If you have both incoming and outgoing transactions in your bank account, that does not necessarily mean that they will only consider the incoming ones.
Next, unless you run a business or there is some sort of criminal investigation against you, it is unlikely that your home will be raided or that you end up in jail anytime soon. More likely you'll continue to receive seriously sounding letters and summons.
Get a tax specialist to help you. Have them draft a letter and send it back to the tax office.

The refund policy isn't unusual for Bitcoin payments, even though it may be unusual for other types of payments. I recommend that people make themselves familiar with refund policies before they order stuff with bitcoins. To btctrip I recommend to perhaps warn the customer during booking about the refund policies.
With respect to btctrip, I booked with them about 10 times and it always worked out fine. The communication did have the type of latency that OP is mentioning, but in my case I didn't mind. Btctrip is my preferred flight booking method. I also had a chance to talk to their CEO at a conference.
For comparison, about a month ago I tried to book on expedia and it was a horror, and in the end it turned out I can't even pay with bitcoins. Despite them being often in the news about taking bitcoins, it only works in the US and only for hotels. If you're not in the US or you want to book a flight, no bitcoins. It isn't documented that they don't take bitcoins outside of the US anywhere (I had to call them), and their US website has broken redirects and isn't accessible from outside of the US either unless you know http to work around it. And the US website still won't let you book flights that are not in the US (in my case from Europe to Asia). In the global economy, this is bullshit. No wonder they complain their bitcoin bookings are falling, they don't work!

So only enable the features that you need during the initialising of ssl context and only support a cipher that you consider secure, because we don't need to support 20 year old browsers connecting to a bitcoin node.


You can of course turn authentication off entirely and use anonymous ciphers with ephemeral encryption keys.


And OpenSSL 1.1.0 has support for chacha20-poly1305:

Well, it's an improvement, because two years ago he argued bitcoins are a ponzi scheme. He didn't explain why he was wrong in the first place, unfortunately. Then, apparently, he argued that it is only good for black market businesses. Now he argues they don't have good enough integration with accounting systems (as if black market businesses didn't have to calculate profit and loss).
The argument itself may be true (I for example have had troubles finding a single-entry bookkeeping system for my business, I ended up using google spreadsheets with external APIs), the integration could be more varied and flexible, but the examples he's using are stupid. Barcodes? Barcodes don't contain pricing information, just like they don't contain tax information. PoS price conversion? There are tons of solutions for that already. I demoed bitpay's android PoS at a conference twice myself. And just earlier this week, bitpay announced integration into a PoS terminal systems:  (for the record, I'm not affiliated with bitpay, I just use them as an example).
Of course, none of that matters if you hold bitcoins and convert them to dollars/euros yourself prior to going to Walmart.

Bitcoinbon is relatively new, they officially launched only about a month ago, but according to the company, it has been very successful so far, despite about 8% total fee (which is split among the companies facilitating the whole thing). Not all of the shops that are on the map support it yet, they need to make a software update on their terminals and turn on Bitcoinbon support and some haven't done it yet, but many of them allegedly work already.
You redeem them online on the bitcoinbon.com website, and it asks you for a name and email address (which is not verified). *Advertisement: if you want a throwaway email address without leaking your identity, you can use my service,  , which I launched at the same event where Bitcoinbon was launched.* You need to redeem the Bitcoinbon voucher within 1 year or they expire.

This happened to me too. In my case, it meant that the account was suspended due to pending AML check. The error message in the android PoS app is misleading. Contact their support and ask about account status.

If I understand the design you're describing, yes. The web server hosting the QR code generator will see the IP of the server that does the preview (and the web server operator can thus conclude that the preview server is generating a QR code for payment). However, the web server won't see the bitcoin address, amount etc.
Also, the link produced by the generator above the QR code is clickable and if you have a bitcoin URI handler setup locally, it will invoke it.

Well, since people are complaining that it does not interoperate with other email services, you can you Bitmessage and an email gateway.
I officially joined the Bitmessage project last week and [am planning to have a new release]( In the meantime, you can use [my bitmessage fork](
I also run an [email gateway for Bitmessage]( and you can run PGP on top of that. At the moment using it is a bit of a hassle, but I plan on improving that. Bitmessage protects your identity while PGP protects the contents of the messages. If the other side is willing to use Bitmessage too, you can skip the email+PGP part.

I checked OpenSSL sources, and it looks like you cannot manually disable all extensions, only a limited subset, and you need to know in advance the names of the flags. That was the case during heartbleed, and still is now. So here it looks like you're right.


That's possible, but heartbleed is the only security vulnerability that I remember that would have affected a situation like this, because the other affected parts of the code are not necessary in a situation like this and can be turned off. TLS extensions appear to be an exception in that they are not sufficiently configurable.


However, you still would have to maintain the code, and clients written in other languages would have to reimplement and maintain it too. Also, the heartbeat extension was also a short patch, and it originally passed review, even though it was buggy.
In summary, I'm now undecided on the issue.

You use language. You just wrote on reddit yourself, using English. But language is a virtual concept, not backed by anything, and a particular language only works due to network effect. Languages exist because they decrease transaction costs of communication. As long as they do, they will exist. Those languages that give you the best way to communicate also tend to be studied by people, due to the network effect. Apart from linguists and maybe people who want to train their brains, people typically learn languages in order to improve their communication potential, rather than knowing the language for the sake of itself.
It's analogous with media of exchange. Those that have comparative advantages will be those that are preferred by the users. People do not use them because they want to own them, but because they will make it more efficient to own the things they actually want.
The production costs are not really relevant. The market price is only influenced by production costs indirectly, the relevant factor is the interplay of supply and demand.

you're not entirely correct. FRB is not automatically a better representation of savings, rather only when the FRB instrument does not act as a part of the money supply. If it does, you get a multiplier effect and a disequilibrating force.
My point is not that people should leave money that they want to save at home. Even in a Bitcoin system, people would still invest their money, and if the financial instruments they use are highly liquid, you get the best of both worlds: on demand availability and channeling saved monetary units into being used in investment. But when the instruments are so liquid that they become a part of the money supply, you'll end up with trouble, as it will fuel a disruption in economic calculation (credit cycle).

you're mixing two things: credit expansion and FRB. FRB only leads to credit expansion if it decreases transaction costs (or so I argue). Otherwise FRB instruments are only treated as a credit instrument and not as a money substitute, i.e. not as a part of the money supply. There are plenty of investment vehicles that do not act as a part of the money supply, and when transaction costs of the specie are sufficiently low, so will it be with generic loans. System like Bitcoin basically separates credit from the money supply, so you get best of both worlds.
I just noticed I once also mixed up FRB with credit expansion once in the linked article, I just fixed it. I try to distinguish between FRB and credit expansion.
In other words, we need to separate two things. Why do people want to hold FRB instruments (which may include the interest payments as one of the reasons) and why do people want to use FRB instruments as a medium of exchange (which, I argue, requires that the FRB instruments decrease transaction costs). That they historically manifested themselves through a common instrument is an empirical quirk and not an economic rule. The ability to loan money is beneficial, I also agree with you (contrary to many Austrians) that maturity transformation can be beneficial, and if the loan ends up being a liquid instrument, it also can be beneficial. But if it is so liquid that it becomes a part of the money supply, that's when it has a detrimental effect on the economy (credit cycle).

FRB does not automatically lead to credit expansion. Merely having a lending institution with fractional reserves does not necessarily mean that the money supply changes. This requires that the balances of the institution are treated as nearly perfect substitutes to money. I argue that unless these instruments decrease transaction costs (and thus are used as media of exchange, as jesset77 also argues), it is unlikely that the market will treat them as near perfect substitutes. They still might be liquid, like government bonds for example, but they probably won't be a part of the money supply. And this is, from the perspective of the gold standard branch of the Austrian School, the main issue: fluctuations of the money supply due to credit.
I admit there is a bit of fuzziness here. I have been thinking about the definition of money supply for a long time, and at this moment I think that this is an empirical issue. It can't be apriori determined with apodictic certainty whether an instrument will or will not become a part of the money supply. Ultimately, it is the actions of the market participants which either do, or don't, treat the instrument as a nearly perfect substitute to money. But I think that if I had to pick one factor, transaction costs are probably the best predictor for influencing whether the instrument will or won't become of the money supply.
Some Austrians argue that FRB is a violation of property rights. I don't think so, and Bitcoin makes the question of legality of FRB much less important. If FRB does not lead to credit expansion (a change in the money supply), the economic effects of it, interpreted from the perspective of the gold standard branch of the Austrian School, are not detrimental. In fact they probably are beneficial, as the emergence of liquid instruments decreases the demand for money (so Rothbard argues).

Bitcoin reduces transaction costs of trade. That's what its comparative advantage is. As long as it keeps it, it will continue growing, at the cost of the market share of other monies and payment systems, due to the network effect. Bitcoin does not need to be "backed" by anything, since Bitcoin is not a money substitute, it's a pseudo-commodity. Almost none of the immaterial goods are "backed" by anything, they only work due to the network effect of underlying standards (e.g. languages, communication protocols and so on). Bitcoin is also a standard.
It would be absurd to claim that language is only virtual, therefore it will collapse and people will revert to pre-lingual communication, or that digital communication protocols are only virtual and therefore people will revert to sending letters as these are physical. One protocol can replace another alright, but a regression to a less advanced stage of communication is extremely unlikely, unless maybe catastrophes destroy all the capital and almost all humans beings.
However, one should be cautious about interpreting this as the price of Bitcoin will be growing. This is not the same thing. Acceptance and liquidity will be growing, but that's not the same thing as a price. The price can drop alright.

I've been to several smaller meetups, plus the conference in Prague (November 2011) and London (September 2012). In particular the last one had a wide range of topics discussed (apart from Bitcoin also free software, 3d gun printing, agorism, ...), at least 300 people attended, and it was great. I met many people whom I only knew online, as well as made new acquaintances. One of the best experiences in my life. So many talented people interested in making the world a better place.
The one in San Jose is supposed to be more businesslike, so it will probably be somewhat different, but I'm pretty sure it will be interesting too. There's still a significant overlap of topics.
I might be biased though because I was one of the speakers in London and I'm on the economics panel in San Jose.

Let me quote my favourite passage explaining why Bitcoin matters. It's from Carl Menger's "Principles of Economics" from 1871:




Bitcoin is an example of such economic development.

The argument of Smiling Dave is methodologically absurd. It mixes empirical and deductive reasoning. He claims that something that already happened 3 years ago (Bitcoin gaining liquidity) cannot happen. He is also oblivious to the concept of liquidity in general, the network effect, immaterial goods and transaction costs, but that's just a side note.
