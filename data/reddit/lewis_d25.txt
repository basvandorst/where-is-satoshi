The “I’m too poor to buy bitcoin” argument is total BS. You don’t have to buy an entire bitcoin to invest in it and see gains. You can buy any fractional denomination you want (.05, .1, .5, etc). Buy as much as you can using money you can afford to lose if things go bad.

-	South Korea bans all exchanges in their country
-	U.S. introduces excessive new sanctions
These two events would have the potential to cause a short to mid term correction.

Buy in, but don’t invest your entire net worth. Buy smaller amounts on a consistent basis to get a piece of the action if the price continues to run up, but also to take advantage of any big dips in price that come along.

Stop using TouchID, and use a 9 digit alphanumeric pin code.
The benefit of Apple’s closed ecosystem is that Apple reviews every app. The possibility of malware getting through is extremely low to nonexistent.

The price has been consolidating this week, nothing to do with Barcelona. Expect a price boost by the end of August.

Tell her you own Bitcoin, but don’t tell her how much. Sell just enough bitcoin to guarantee your child’s future education and safety/security, put a sizable down payment on a house, and pay for your wife’s part time education so she can find a career she enjoys. Don’t forget to pay your taxes too. Hold on to the rest of the Bitcoin.
Don’t listen to these idiots telling you to divorce her and run away with the money.

You won’t like this reply, but no one ever wins when trying to cheat the IRS. Just pay your taxes when necessary.

Like others have said, Bitcoin should not be your concern. If an EMP hits you need to be ready. Food, clean water, medicine, and a secure shelter for you and your family. Guns and ammo to protect against others trying to steal your food and supplies. Prioritize.
