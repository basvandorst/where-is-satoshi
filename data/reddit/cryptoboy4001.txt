Why do you believe the Weiss rankings must be either completely embraced or completely rejected?  
 
It's completely normal for someone to look at a list of rankings and say "I agree with this, but not this ...".  I'm sure Charles is happy with Cardano being judged positively, yet is equally unhappy with Ethereum being judged postively.

Charles was sacked from the Ethereum Project early on and remains bitter about it to this day.  It's the reason he works on Ethereum competitors such as ETC and Cardano.
So, when he saw Ethereum do well in the Weiss rankings he was obviously sore.  He doesn't give a shit about BTC, but as an opponent of Ethereum he's clearly figured he'd do well to align himself with the Bitcoin community (i.e. the enemy of my enemy is my friend).

I totally get why a casual observer would have concluded Bitcoin was going nowhere and decided it was too late.
The point is, when I speak to colleagues at work who now say "Damn, I wish I'd bought some", I inevitably find that none of them actually know much about Bitcoin at all (i.e. what mining is, what a wallet is, how to buy Bitcoin, etc.) which leads me to believe that the reason they didn't buy any Bitcoin was not because they'd learned about it and concluded it had no future, but rather because they'd never bothered to learn about it at all.

Keiser saying it's "guaranteed" to rise 10x shouldn't be taken literally.
No-one can guarantee anything. I can't even guarantee I'll be alive by the time I finish typing this sentence, since I could have a heart attack mid-sentence.
It's just a reflection of Keiser's confidence in Bitcoin and should be interpreted the same way as a boxer saying he guarantees he'll knock out his opponent in an upcoming match.

The correct answer to that old koan is ... no, it does not make sound if no-one is there to hear it.
**Sound** is a pressure wave in air (or other medium) that is *perceived* by a receiver.  The perception of the pressure wave is a critical factor for it to be a sound.  If it's not perceived, it's not technically a sound - it's just a pressure wave.
So when the tree falls, it generates a pressure wave ... but unless there is a someone (or something) with the ability to perceive this wave, then no sound has occurred.
Of course, the explanation above completely misses the point of the zen koan - which is to find oneself frustrated with one's attempts to solve a (supposedly) intractable problem and reach a point where you are forced to abandon logic as a means to solve the problem.  At that point you tell your zen master the answer to the koan is "The apple pie in the garden", or similar nonsense, and apparently become enlightened immediately.

The source of confusion here is that the use of language in everyday life doesn't require us to adhere to strict dictionary definitions.  For example, there are subtle differences between 'money' and 'currency', yet they are used interchangeably by most people ... and we're forgiving of this even though we know they're different. 
Sound is a word that used in a similar manner.
The audio device in your example doesn't *actually* record sound. It's recording the displacement of a membrane caused by pressure waves in air.  These pressure waves are only classified as 'sound' if they're perceived by a listener.
The point is:  pressure waves + perception = sound.

Violence ... because you used "physical force" to cause damage.
There can be no violence unless there is the application of physical force.  Look, I didn't make the word OK, it had a definition long before I was born.
If you consider "restriction of free choice" as violence, then a large burger chain could be accused of "violence" if they put a rival chain out of business ... as this restricted my free choice to purchase burgers at the rival chain.
It's also a definition of violence that veers *very* close to social justice warrior territory.

It's not about what I believe.  It's about how the word 'sound' is defined.  As I've stated (multiple times now), the physical air pressure waves exist irrespective of whether anyone perceives them or not.
But for an air pressure wave to be classified as 'sound' it needs to be *perceptible*, which means it needs to be between 20Hz to 20kHz (it also needs to be above 0 dB(A) under lab conditions, or 20 dB(A) in the field)
If I create an air pressure wave at 50 kHz, you **can't** perceive it and so it's not called 'sound' anymore ...  it's called 'ultrasound' (literally meaning "above sound").
If I create an air pressure wave at 10 Hz, you **can't** perceive it and it's not called 'sound' anymore ...  it's called 'infrasound' (literally meaning "below sound").
Acoustic waves cover a wide spectrum, for which 'sound' is only a subset.

If Gavin's advocating a scorched earth policy then he should know better.  It won't work.  
Conventional wisdom before the DAO fork was that the minority chain after a fork would just wither and die.  The survival of ETC has shown that if people *really* want the minority chain to survive, it'll survive.
Passions on both sides of the scaling war are so hot that there's no way the losing side will sit by and allow their chain to just wither away.
Bitcoin *will* end up with two chains (one large and one small) and the minor chain *will* continue to be an antagonist that claims to be "The Real Bitcoin" for the rest of time.  It happened to ETH, and it'll happen to BTC.

The falling tree made pressure waves.  For the person with normal hearing, these pressure waves were perceived as sound.  For the person who was deaf, these pressure waves were not perceived.
Ultimately, the 'sound' is made within one's brain - it's an interpretation of the pressure waves hitting the membrane in your inner ear.  Different specifies, when exposed to the same pressure waves, will perceive 'sound' differently.  One could even imagine a species that perceived pressure waves as imagery (visual), instead of auditory.

The majority of development in Ethereum is being done by third parties like Consensys and Parity, and it's not like anything Vitalik says gets the green light - just ask Ethereum's co-founder Gavin Wood (who now heads Parity, and is no friend of the foundation).
Vitalik's primary role these days is to research Proof of Stake with Vlad Zamfir and a small team ... and the Proof of Stake is ultimately designed to make PoW miners redundant - so why would the miners support Vitalik just because he's spearheading ways to make them redundant?

Here's the problem ... the Winkelvii first applied for the ETF back in 2013.  So the SEC would have conducted a review of regulations covering "significant markets" for Bitcoin sometime between 2013 - 2016, but all the Chinese exchanges were effectively unregulated during this period (PBOC only started getting strict with them in Jan 2017).  
However, once the SEC had their review, then as far as they're concerned, they've done their job.  The check-box for that task can be ticked. Case closed.
Now. anytime another Bitcoin ETF is up for evaluation, they'll just follow procedure which will be something like: "Has a review of significant markets for Bitcoin been done in the previous 5 years?  It has ... OK, then we can refer to that report as part of our evaluation".
The only way a crypto ETF would stand a chance now is if it was for a coin for which the Chinese exchanges were never a "significant market".  So, if Litecoin was hoping for something ... forget it.

Actually, it was *you* who made the argument that miners do whatever Vitalik recommends because they depend on his development.  I pointed out the flaw in that argument because clearly his "development" is the last thing they want.  
But you're correct that there are other factors at play ... or to put it another way, miners are *not* just doing whatever Vitalik wants.
As for Peercoin, it's using an early version of PoS which requires centralised "checkpoints" to work.  The system Ethereum wants to use aims to be an improvement upon that, otherwise they may as well just stay on PoW forever (like ETC) ... but Ethereum doesn't want to end up with the same miner cartel problems Bitcoin is facing.

In Ethereum, there are two groups (ETH and ETC) with disparate agendas. However, since they each have their own coin, neither side can stonewall the ambitions of the other.
Also, for the ETH community, the existence of ETC serves as a pressure release valve of sorts - anyone finding themselves vehemently at odds with the direction ETH is going in, can just switch to ETC, rather than stay in ETH and instigate a civil war campaign of the type you see in Bitcoin.
As for it being a "split"; the market eventually favors one over the other (ETH is $19.40, ETC is $1.40).

Ethereum was Vitalik's idea and he's the public face of Ethereum, but the development of the protocol, the EVM, solidity language, etc. was a team effort from Dr Gavin Wood, Jeffrey Wilcke and several others, all of whom are still working on it either as part of the Ethereum Foundation or commercially.
As for ETC, if their only hope to move the ETC/ETH price is to pray that Vitalik leaves Ethereum, it doesn't say much about ETC does it?

With Ethereum, the larger ETH chain has 93% of the total market value (with ETC having only 7%).

In theory, that could happen.  
In practice (and this is just my opinion of course), I think most dissidents will find enough within the community of the "protest coin" (in this case ETC) that their needs will be satisfied.
It's like religions.  Yes, we have thousands of little religions (cults?) that are splits of splits of splits etc. of larger, earlier more established religions.  But those larger, original religions are still around and still have all the power (they have not become "useless" from the splits).
ETH was large enough to survive the fork.  Initially, the smaller chain (ETC) was worth 50% of the larger chain (ETH).  Today ETC is worth 7% of ETH, and falling.  If ETH can survive a fork, and indeed thrive, then I'm sure BTC is strong enough to handle it also.

The DAO thief/hero (depending on your philosophy), didn't really get any 'free' money.  They 'acquired' ETH from the DAO investors initially, then it was taken back via the fork, but then after the fork it was returned, in a sense, in a lesser form ... that of ETC tokens.

We should've moved to mBTC years ago.  Many people are turned off Bitcoin because they feel they've "missed the boat" to get into it based on a misunderstanding that BTC is only traded in integer units and is therefore too expensive to purchase.

Of course, this move could easily be interpreted as just a cynical exercise to stimulate more volume (which it probably is).

I don't know why you put "money" into quotes. Bitcoin is money, just as gold is money. If I send Bitcoin across the network, I'm sending money.  Also, Bitcoin *is* also a payment network (I never used the term "intermediary" as you did).
If you want to insist that it's not money, but it's GOLD, then fine.

I'll grant that he provided *some* value with his post today, though not because of Heisenberg (that's related to uncertainties in measuring momentum and location in subatomic particles ... but I digress).

I didn't ignore that rule.  I followed it.  I bought "low" at $1100 in 2013, then sold "high" at $10,000 (approx) in 2017.  Thankfully I was a hodler and not a panic seller.
Even though at the time (2014 - 2015) I *believed* that $1100 was "high", with the passage of time the market made me realise that this had in fact been a "low".
My point is that, you don't really know what's "high" and "low" until quite some has passed.

I'm skeptical.  Of course, the 'easy' solution to get over this hump is cryonics.  Get thawed out in 50 years, assuming the 2067-era nano-bots can repair the cellular damage from freezing, and you pop out good to go.

However, those are not the conditions.  The conditions are that the scaling debate *is* happening, and so a disgruntled 2X'er is the most likely explanation (under the existing conditions).  The 'data' you're looking for is his twitter commentaries, coupled with the knowledge of human nature that you and I are both aware of.
Of course, it's a theory.  It's not proof.  But as I said, if you expect 'proof' you won't be able to make any judgement about anything really because absolute proof is impossible, either in science or in police investigations.

The whole point of having 20 random words is to provide sufficient entropy that it's effectively uncrackable via brute force.
By writing down 16 and remembering four, you're comprising that security on two fronts:
1) The entropy is now only 4 random words - this is crackable via brute force.
2) If detected, that document (or file) with 16 random words on it will make you a person worthy of "extra attention" ... by which I mean you'll be hit with a $5 wrench until you demonstrate to them exactly what the passwords are for.

I've been hearing about a cure for cancer (or more accurately, cancers - as each is a unique disease) being 'just around the corner' since I was a kid reading "World of the Future" books.
When you're young, a 20 year time-frame seems like it's long enough to achieve almost anything.  But when you're old, like me, then 20 years is a blink of an eye where technology made huge advances in some areas (telecommunications), but little progress in others (longevity rates for cancer patients).

If Harvey Weinstein's house was egged tomorrow, would you argue that those concluding it's related to his recent scandal are jumping to conclusions without any basis?
Lopp's a prominent individual in this space (i.e. more prominent than you or I) and has taken a public stance on a very heated, and emotional, debate.  While you personally may not consider it as heated and emotional, look around - many do.
The most likely explanation (by far) for him being targeted is his public stance on 2X.  If you're looking for absolute proof, complete with DNA evidence, you'll likely never find it.  As a scientist, you should know that nothing in science can ever be proven, just verified to some degree.

People buy things they need, and things they want (but don't actually need).

Purchase and consumption of items in the 'needs' category would continue as before.  However, purchase of items in the 'wants' category drives a significant percentage of the economy. So if people spend less on the latest gizmo crap, and save their money instead, the economy's growth slows and people start losing their jobs.

With BTC, that's basically impossible since it's price is all over the place from day to day.
So, to cover myself in the event of an audit, I'd need to record each and every transaction I make, recording the date, the reason for the purchase, the BTC purchase price, the sale price, etc.
This is way too much work just to "support the cause", given that I can just use a debit card and tap'n'go with fiat and not worry about  recording the transaction.

It's amazing that people here are hoping the US government (i.e. the SEC) will go after Ethereum, so that Bitcoin can stay on top. The old skool libertarians of Bitcoin's early days must be spinning in their graves.

As odd as it may sound to people here, banks don't trust one another.  So sending money from Bank A to Bank B, which may involve going through several intermediaries,  can be a slow process due to the checks at each stage.
A blockchain-based platform solves this problem by allowing the transit of funds to be transparent.  The level of transparency (i.e. who gets to see what) being controlled via smart contracts.
Currency is just one application of a decentralized ledger.

It worked out badly.
But this is not a TA chart, so why bring up TA?

A lot of those Chinese bitcoin farms get their electricity from hydropower (i.e. renewable energy).
But moot point.  It ain't Bitcoin anyway.

Sure, but imagine if it had been the team behind an Ethereum project's ICO.  Chris DeRose would be typing up a letter to the SEC as we speak.

Actually, four times.
Problem is, anytime he's on, Joe asks questions as if he forgot everything he learned from the previous times Andreas explained it all to him.  Joe does a lot of weed.

I know, and as long as their only reaction to Bitcoin's current crisis is to kick the smaller coin (and ETH is, for now, still the smaller coin) to relieve their stress, then their problems will continue.
It's like an abusive parent beating his kid to vent his frustration instead of sorting out his own shit.

A blockchain still offers potential improvements over the existing SWIFT system as it currently operates.  I don't see why banks trying to save costs is seen as controversial on this sub.
"Under the current correspondent banking model, banks need to monitor the funds in their overseas accounts via debit and credit updates and end-of-day statements. The maintenance and operational work involved represents a significant portion of the cost of making cross-border payments. This PoC will test whether distributed ledgers may be able to help banks reconcile those nostro accounts more efficiently and in real time, lowering costs and operational risk."

That was a bit of a publicity stunt, given the company's owner later said "We were always going to move.”

You must have done a cost benefit analysis to conclude that, which the banks clearly didn't even do as a first step.
God, those banks are stupid.

*"MU2 and Bitcache will take  mainstream. I expect Bitcoin to hit the $2000 mark within 2 years."*
Awesome. Once MU2 gets launched, Kim's gonna take us to $2000!

His system has a methodology.  In other words, he's not using a random number generator for his predictions.
However, the predictions of his system have no correlation with real prices.  So, it's *as good as* a random number generator.
His predictions are not off by 5% or 10%, but by several hundred percent.
