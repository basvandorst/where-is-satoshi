I have USD money deposited in my Deposit wallet with Bitfinex. When will I be able to wire withdraw some of my money? Sincerely, ABE6

It would seem to myself and other Bitfinex customers that you are stonewalling us in a similar manner in which MtGox did back in 2013.  Customers that have bank deposits through Bitfinex have legal rights pertaining to banking laws.  You cannot hold our money for ransom while you figure it out.  Bitfinex is under definite legal obligations to let us access our money in these bank accounts.  By continuing in this current manner, you are setting yourself up for additional trouble that you don't need!  
I would like some official statements or a press conference from you guys.  The current state of limbo is unacceptable and the longer it continues, the more your reputation, the reputation of Bitcoin, and the goose that lays golden eggs, which even now still has the potential for MOUNTAINS of future golden eggs will suffer!

Hell no.  A thief takes the cd player from your car. We all park in the same parking lot.  My car wasn't stolen from.  Does it makes sense that the lot manager should rip the cd player out of my car and give it to you just because we park in the same lot? No, it doesn't.  This is a correct analogy that applies to this situation.

zanetackett: 
Tuesday, "You can expect a response by tomorrow."
Wednesday, "You can expect a response by tomorrow."
Thursday, "You can expect a response by tomorrow."
Bullshit.  Can we get a real answer from someone in charge?!

 Taking money out of a User's DEPOSIT WALLET to fund a socialized loss schemata is a TERRIBLE IDEA!  USD in the deposit wallet is essentially a BANK ACCOUNT, and should be fully insured by the FDIC. I do not see how Bitfinex can possibly take that action without shooting their company AND their employees in the foot.
 To take money out of a bank account without the expressed, written authorization of the account holder amounts to egregious criminal activity according to both US and International law!
 If Bitfinex reaches into what are USD bank accounts anyway, they are setting the company up for a world of hurt.  Additionally, they would open up their employees to huge personal risk of civil action against their persons in multiple jurisdictions.  If I was a Bitfinex employee, there would be no way in hell that I would risk that!  
 Ok, so when will we get some official answers?  This tomorrow, tomorrow line of answering is proving most vexing.

Excellent comment, especially, "Having said that they really have to clean things up and add transparency moving forward.
Bitgo should buy back as much as possible some of the bfxcoin as a show of good faith in the bitcoin space if they wish to continue.

Praise the one who's potential theft stole 36% of my Bitfinex account and 36% of the accounts of other Bitfinex users?
