As far as I understand, nodes running prior to segwit are still operational. Segwit is optional and you can choose to support it or not. Over the years there have been many changes/fixes/upgrades to bitcoin.. using your thinking the original chain has died a heap of times. But fact remains it’s always been the same chain.

Curious, why would anyone NOT want cheaper fees? ..ofcourse this is a feature everyone wants.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:10:21
That’s incorrect, it literally forked *because* they made changes that weren’t compatible and because they couldn’t get enough for consensus created a new chain.
Segwit was an optional addition, you could support it or just continue running your node as is.

I’m looking at it like they want to finish the blueprints first to get a better understanding of exactly how much.. rather than just piling more on these huge slow databases. More efficient fast blocks first then increase if needed (doesn’t the current lightning mention possible 100mb blocks eventually with the world using it?).
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:16:57
Complete non techie here, but I’m guessing we will see bigger blocks eventually. They just want to work on efficiency and get everything right first so there not massive unruly databases.. like finish the blueprints before building the boat. 
Idk that’s just what Ive gotten from interviews.

I don’t understand how people expect work to get done without developers grouping up.. magic?
Of course people with a vested interest in bitcoin and developers are going to form up and work together. At the end of the day their work has to be voted on by the majority.
Throughout bitcoins life we will see many company’s pop up and build on it.

In theory couldn’t those coins be used to tank a bitcoin fork he doesn’t agree with? ..He’s basically got a free bcash detonator.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:35:29
On a serious note. Why arnt wallets/exchanges rushing to support segwit? Wouldn’t this be better for everybody?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:49:48
Bitcoin is user driven and had a lot of problems that needed to be worked on. Or should innovation not be allowed and watch as other coins take over with smart contracts or whatever new thing there is.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:57:48
I’m guessing you’ve responded to the wrong person as it has nothing to do with my post. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:01:44
No they got it right. Cryptocurrencies all have different values, many don’t share the same as bitcoin that popularised it.
Which is something I wish more people would remember when there off shilling there ‘x’ speed new coin.
@_date: 2018-05-02 14:48:36
Even more frustrating (if not using atm’s for dodgy reasons) you still need to pay tax on it.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:38:46
No I don’t, did you even read my post?
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:02:31
Even if there wasn’t a fork it’s not the official bitcoin website and shouldn’t be there.
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:33:29
The issue isn’t really about differing opinions but rather that those links make it look like an official website for bitcoin. There’s no reason it or any other 3rd party hosted bitcoin site should be listed there.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:19:56
How about ‘Bitcoin’?
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:22:27
There’s already multiple company’s working on lightning..

The real bitcoin is whatever consensus says it is. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 13:15:34
Silly question, is the USD their mostly using to hold value only accessible via outside banks accessed over the internet? Or do they have to hide the physical cash?
Seems without electricity and internet everything in today’s society’s would be crippled.
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:43:36
Anyone mind explaining to me the point of going ahead with the Segwit2x fork would be.. doesn't BCH effectively do all the same things they want?
@_date: 2017-08-10 05:09:53
Kind of outrageous this is possible.. if they can decide what you can spend your money on is it yours?
Out of curiosity what happens to the money in your account?

Its only been there for a few days :| ..
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:47:11
If your bitcoin wallet address starts with ‘bc1’ it is segwit, if it starts with a 3 it *could* be a segwit address aswell.
If your using a ledger is pretty sure it’s specified.

Paper money is going away regardless of crypto. The current path is just all digital cash in banks where they can trace and freeze it. There’s also an increasing amount of restrictions with paper money.

Wouldn't they owe the amount of BTC and not the price of what they were in random other currency at the time? why not just pay them in bottle caps.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:37:13
Idk, I've kinda got into the thinking that all these hurdles are required for bitcoin to succeed. With every test bitcoins gone through proving itself so far..  it's only gotten stronger and people have more confidence.
If bitcoin can't survive the Segwit2x then it's not what we thought it was and it's a failure.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:01:47
To be honest at this point i just want to get past this 2x or not so we can stop all this bs in-fighting and focus on the real road blocks. Theres enough problems Bitcoin needs to solve without these unnecessary ones.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:08:44
Ok nvm then I don’t follow the news about bcash, assumed it wouldn’t be listed.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:55:34
Unless the exchange you had your coins chooses to support the fork you will not have access to them. It isn’t realistic for an exchange to support / add support for every million fork that pops up.
If you want to have access to all of these you should either have your crypto in your own wallet that you control or at least research how your exchange is going to handle them prior to the fork.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:54:36
Isn’t this why things like the mimblewimble protocol is being developed? But just like most of today’s crypto it’s in very early stages.
@_date: 2018-03-07 03:29:19
I don't think many were welcoming them, but knew they were inevitable and happy that the issue was in the context of 'what are the best ways to work with it' rather than against it.

Feel like a fool, wasn’t even aware of any controversy with tether. Is there really no verification that it is actually backed by anything?
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:23:08
Looking at the front page now there is atleast a handful of posts that would at least be in the perfect spot to have a look at bitcoin.
If your young with savings looking for investment opportunities it seems like a disservice to completely overlook crytocurriences, its like this generations housing boom. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:45:02
There’s a big difference those new coins are not the same currency at all.

Bitcoin noob here with a question. Is bitcoin hitting new highs a good thing for bitcoin? or is it kinda like overvalued stock waiting to crash? Every year i look at getting into Bitcoin, only to see the price (seems outrageously expensive) and forget about it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:38:13
Honest question. Is it unreasonable for miners to expect a degree of fees? (after all it is the business there in to make money). Just trying to look at it from the other side.
And arnt Bitcoin high fee's still much lower than traditional banking?
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:31:16
Got that in layman terms for a noob? :p ( and where I can find this type of information to learn about it).
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:50:43
People don't know what Bitcoin is, its just 'money' makes it clearer. This isn't exactly the news we want to be commonly associated with Bitcoin anyway is it?
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:08:43
Find it odd, as with fiat coins you can buy fractions of aswell 100cents = $1. So even the coin analogy still should work.
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:37:20
Is it really expected to do anything while all this hard fork fud is still in the air?
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:53:26
Bitcoin is up like  over 300% since last year. You know how ridiculously big that is in investment land? Even bitcoin can’t provide people’s unrealistic expectations if you are salty that it’s only provided that in the last few months ��
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:11:13
Because a high spec rig for gaming wouldn't make you any money yet alone pay electricity. To profit on BTC you need specialised ASIC hardware that cost a lot (even then electricity  cost plays a large part).
There are Alt coins that are designed to be mined with GPU's (Such as Ethereum/Monero etc) but again the rigs people make for mining are on another level. Mining also puts a lot of pressure on your device, without great cooling you'll likely burn out CPU/GPU.

Heard Gemini afew times. What countries to they support?
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:17:43
Is it like cash though? .. Gold is probably a closer fit to bitcoin than cash in its current form. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 03:19:13
And better yet, once your verified they enforce a trivially small limit for months.

It is pretty easy to buy these days, as in with a quick google search the average joe can figure it out with a bit of reading (much simpler than it used to be!) its still ways away from hitting mainstream however, its very much the early adopter stage. Its often compared to the position the internet was in during its early days. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:16:25
Its actually not that hard, heaps of ways you could do it following a tutorial. Unfortunately to make a profit these days you need cheap/free electricity and expensive hardware. For most its just a costly hobby.. unfortunately ;(
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:02:10
Battling with the same choice atm. Unfortunately for me it feels too speculative or down to luck. It will likely only be in hindsight what was the correct move.. atleast with what i am able to deduce with my limited knowledge.
Both are likely in a bubble, both could crash or double, if i move from one to the other likely ill have backed the wrong one. So i guess ill just hold.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:53:44
They do make it clear, it's literally the fist thing that comes up when you create a wallet and mentioned in every article I've read. Hope you find your money mate ;(
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:27:28
Asked this before but didn't know. Gemini only supports US yea?
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:16:27
Yea you're right. I just think the wise play is approaching it as a costly hobby not expecting returns, if there is profit then its like someone just gave you a free cookie :)
Personally my hand was sort of forced anyway, i live in a place with one of the highest cost of electricity in the world, so its really never been an option.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:57:07
That doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't good advice. Instead of mining you could have put that electricity money directly into bitcoins and be far better off now yes?
Instead of spending 1k+ on a ASIC with a bleak outlook you could just buy bitcoin with it and enjoy the price rising.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:29:41
Jaxx is a hot wallet designed to be used kind of like the spending money in your physical wallet. If you had a much larger sum wouldn't you already be using something else?
I wouldn't keep thousands of coins on any phone app ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:55:39
That's something I didn't consider ��. But Wouldn't that be similar to not cancelling your credit cards etc after you've realised the wallets stolen?
