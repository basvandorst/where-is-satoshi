Well, in case of Monero, I can easily create secure and private transactions that cannot be tracked. I cannot do that with bitcoin very easily.

No seriously

Stop spamming your own domains.

Isn't that the idea?

You are now.

So has litecoin just sayin'.

This. Domaining. Anyone who was an early adopter is filthy rich.

1. 
tl;dr ninja-mined
2. That is a possibility. Bitcoin is already under a lot of scrutiny and pressure for anonymity that it doesn't even have. That could cause hesitation from the bitcoin community to implement something like that. Maybe we will see Monero or something similar as a sidechain. I'm a firm believer there will be a few other large alts in play when all of this comes to fruition. I believe Monero is one of those.

1) Oh come on. 80% premine?
2b) People always want a choice. You believe for no reason everyone will boycott all other cryptocurrencies and only use bitcoin? Why hasn't this already happened?
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:59:50
Well I hope this doesn't become a new trend of everyone posting links to their sound cloud page.

1. Fairbrix is "legit" technically but it doesn't have the marketcap/network
2. That's a lie. 
3. But you have to admit there is a possibility of something happening. We are left in the dark.

I'm waiting for the next crypto bull run to figure out exactly where things are going to go.  I actually think Litecoin is going to stay around and continue to follow bitcoin back up. There are good reasons to like ltc. Will be interesting in general to see what happens in 100 days when litecoin halves. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 21:52:17
Nice thing about litecoin is, no one needs to worry about this kind of stuff. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:21:24
1. 2nd oldest/biggest crypto
2. faster transaction times
3. we know who the creator is
@_date: 2015-05-18 16:20:24
Are you aware the creator of bitcoin has 1 million bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:09:48
butt troll
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:11:25


I would say "Bitcoin is untraceable" for the title of this myth. There are cryptocurrencies that do not allow you to trace transactions (such as xmr).
@_date: 2015-05-15 20:07:27
Ugh, these kind of blatant infomercial like spam posts should be removed/banned. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:32:42
I'll take it. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 05:40:30
Didn't you know we need a separate thread for every news source and blog article for each piece of news?
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:30:41
1. *2nd *legit cryptocurrency 
2. face it, it's faster in use case scenario. 
3.  the creator of bitcoin has 1 million bitcoins. this could potentially become a concern and/or problem.

Ethereum was an IPO scam. Nothing but vaporware.

If it offers something useful that bitcoin doesn't then it serves a purpose. For example, I can easily make private and untraceable transactions with Monero. Bitcoin doesn't offer this feature currently. Some alts are very useful and will have their place alongside bitcoin. Most won't serve any purpose and will die off. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 20:35:07
Monero is neither of those things. Clearly you are confused
