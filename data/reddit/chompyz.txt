imho, Tor Project should add Darkcoin $DRK as a payment option alongside Bitcoin.
Considering that both projects emphasis privacy, it should come as obvious.

I just placed a monthly donation subscription of 5 Euro.
My small, but consistent contribution.
I admit of not using Tails as it exceeds my security, privacy and anonymity needs and places some burden on my casual daily work. 
However, I see it as ultimately important to support such projects so that those who do need it and sometimes even put their liife at stake, would have such great tools at their use. 
Please keep up the great work!!!

Acting as a currency lock is really not enough. You can already do that in many ways today - swap options, exchange to fiat on exchanges etc.
IMHO they should roll-out a Debit-Card that holds fiat (they reserve in fiat anyhow), and is funded via Bitcoins.
Then i'd definately give it a go, and i'm sure many others will too.

I'm not going to FUD or cheerlead anyone. It is not a competition of who offers more.
Darkcoin is simply a privacy-centric payment method, and hence should be added alongside Bitcoin (or Bitcoin+Darkwallet)
Just like you do not normally accept only VISA, but rather also Mastercard, EMEX, PayPal, and other "similar" payment means, in spite of them not seen as being "better".

China is taking over bitcoin at large.

Sorry to be spilling cold water, but this is complete BS.
The IB Tel-Aviv was a dissapointment in terms of participation.
~1/3 were presentors; ~1/3 were VCs/ entrepreneurs, and ~1/3 bitcoiners.
The ~$250/day price was dropped to $20/day because on the second day, it was ~2/3 empty (the first day wasn't much better, with ~170 people alltogether, including all above).
The event was not mentioned in a single media in Israel, neither online, offline, or TV!!!
In contrary to the hype of the article, there was no regulator in the event.
A pariament member did participate and had very little [if anything] to say. This is not "recognition" by any regulator...
The Central Banker gave a presentation about this so-called 'research paper' that he wrote with Eden Shochat, a very aggresive [in a possitive way] venture capitalist from Aleph VC that focuses on crypto-technology and manages to really stear things [note: I really disslike VCs, but this guy is really working hard to move things in crypto-land].
Nonetheless -
a. the Central Banker is from the research department, and has nothing to do with the regulations, policy or monitoring aspects of the Israeli central bank. The paper is not intented for internal use, and was not referred to by a single autorative figure, neither in the bank, parliament, regulator, or any other civil service person.
 
b. What he wrote together with Eden Shochat was not a 'research' paper per se, but more like a 'look into' the trend and aspects around Bitcoin. If anyone is waiting for a macroeconomic research paper, a simulation model or a recommensation/standpoint for the bank/goverment/regulators policy, then they are up for a BIG dissapointment.
To conclude - 
* Israel is no doubt a hub of research [in contrast to apps/services] innovation in this field (zero-cash, colored coins, mastercoin, to name a few). But these innitiatives/research appeals globally and are well below the Israeli regulator's radar or interest.
* Israel will NEVER EVER lead anything when it comes to regulatory frameworks. It will ALWAYS wait to follow the USA lead. Anyone hoping/claiming otherwise, simply does not understand the local situation.
* Bitcoin adoption in Israel is SEVERELY lagging behind N. America and Europe. A real shame, but this is reality.

If wallet.dat is encrypted via very strong password, why so many still recommends 2FA and cold-storage?

Do not fight is, or be upset by it.  
Just recognize the truth -  
It is a TAX on stupidity

Bait title &amp; article.  
   
Nothing new in this article.   
He bought the coins 3 years ago. He was bullish back then, but it means absolutely nothing about his prognosis or vision now going forward.  
Also, who cares what a dinosaur VC thinks. He comes from the old world. So yea, he was the first major VC to feel the disturbance in the archaic VC model. Big deal.

In blockchain I trust.  
The end game as I see it is "Passport on the Blockchain".  
Just HODL. We'll get there.

I am what is called today "digital nomad". Life like this is both cheap and amazing. Liberated from 8-5 corporate work and management, minimalist in belongings (only a bag), very healthy in diet (vegan), and overall very cheap. You learn to be free and minimalist in needs.  
As for work, I'm involved in the crypto field, so I have a leg up on what is evolving in many projects, some of which I'm hands on helping, and i have a lot of patience. It all pays off, much more than what I need to live in these cheap countries and travel the world.  
Besides, we are ruining the world at such a speed and intensity, that I want to see it YESTERDAY, but I'll settle for today. Not going to wait for tomorrow.

In Cambodia, everything is corrupt. Through "connected people", you bypass official rates. At least I was offered to by such people.  
Tip - Chinese Mafia is well connected there...

A. Have been doing it for several years.  
B. I use tourist visa, which normally grants 30-90 days in any country.  
C. I prefer tourist visa rather than long-term visa because it forces me to go out and tour some new place every now and then. Most people with long term visa get to get stuck in one place.  
D. Whoever prefers long term visas, look at the Philippines (renewable every 30dsys, indefinitely), Thailand (VIP visas), and central America (visa for 90 days with indefinite visa-runs, or rentista visa if you prove monthly allowance of ~$2,000).  
E. Whoever wants to buy a citizenship, look at Cambodia (AFAIK ~$50k), and Caribbeans (~$100k-$200k).  
F. My 2 cents - even if you can afford citizenship, VIP visas etc. Stay true to the libertarian philosophy and stay free.   Obtaining any government license, visa, permit etc. Is playing their game. We don't owe anyone explanations or ask for their permit to live, move, or be anywhere.

Maybe on a certain day Poloniex bypasses Cryptsy in DASH trade, but normally 99% of the time Cryptsy leads this crypto. That is why Dash users were the first to alert and warn on possible problems at Cryptsy.

~$5... i reckoned if "larger" amounts are held back, perhaps try a small amount, of a different coin. Still no success. I really hope we aren't getting Goxed...
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:17:35
1) I use cryptsy for over 2 years, primarily bcs it is the main exchange for DASH.
2) i use most exchanges.
3) now that my withdraw is pending [withheld], i can't break it into small chunks and try to withdraw.
4) i've tried to withdraw 10.5 ETH (which is about $5 worth), and it too is pending for a long while now. Seems nothing goes through, no matter the size.  :(
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:57:53
bcs of the warnings, i withdrew 3 weeks ago what i had there [without any problems], but i still gave them some credit that the warnings might be FUD and left a stack for trading... now i recognise an increasing chance that i was wrong.... i'm still hopeful this is just a platform/support issue.

Update- After ~4 days, I now finally received "some" message from support to one of my tickets, saying:
