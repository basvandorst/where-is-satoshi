Until Coinbase implement Segwit I suggest you avoid them. 
Bitstamp are great in the EU. I know of US exchanges that use Segwit but don't want to suggest one I have no experience with.

Bitstamp however are not incompetent and damaging to crypto

In the UK I have had a lot of trouble and lost time using OKPAY and an exchange.
I tried an international transfer to bitstamp and it was excellent, nice and fast and only one large fee

I got in at $80/BTC (not very many I am poor) and am holding for the long term. I believe in the concept and want it to succeed. I will now try to use BTC for trade wherever possible as it is a double barreled issue, we need trade to increase too.
