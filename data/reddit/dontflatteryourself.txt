So, on their "donate" page there are three options:
1. Donate by credit/debit card. (Presumably using a merchant account through a company they've chosen.)
2. Donate via PayPal
3. Donate via Amazon
Unless you're a bank, you have to pay someone to accept credit cards one way or another.  It's a service, after all.  
Bitcoin would not reduce the fee because converting bitcoins to dollars (also a service) costs money as well.

I was responding to themusicgod1, who implied that wikimedia should not have to convert their bitcoins to dollars.

Well, bitcoin is not exactly a stable currency.  It's new and completely impossible to predict.  Imagine bitcoin got a story on the front page of the New York Times... the value of a bitcoin would skyrocket, then crash as it has before.  If I accepted payments in bitcoins, I wouldn't want to have the money in that type of system for very long (or at all).
I'm not saying bitcoin will never be widely accepted.  It's a great idea.  But for something like this to be successful it takes a very long time, and you have to be reasonable about it.  Keep expectations realistic.  Ask vendors/organizations to accept the currency, but don't demand it - that kinda gives the community a bad image.  Live your life.

What difference does it make what type of currency you donate?  If you actually want to donate, it wouldn't be much trouble to sell your coins and help 'em out.

What meaning is that?

Going to crash.  They have no value.  \*eats popcorn and fantasizes about writing a new program that makes play money that people are stupid enough to buy\*

Yeah.  That's the only "value" that they have.  Money laundering is easy enough without them.  This may be the ultimate black market currency - for pussies who don't deal with anyone in reality.
It's also another sad game people without jobs are playing hoping to make money.  That's really the worst, I think.
