This is why I think PoS is better.  It puts the votes into the hands of the holders, not 3rd parties that may have conflict of interests.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:13:56


It's proven, and it's doing great.   
And yes, there is cold storage out of the box. At worse with cold storage you can't vote which is the same as Bitcoin keys.  
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:07:22
Or the minority just blacklists a few keys.

Yes, it **effectively** does.  Who are you going to trust, the clients with 80% of the coins or 15%?  Either way, the total value of the system would be utterly trashed.  There are so many ways to attack Bitcoin with that much control.  


And what is stopping this from applying to PoS?


Exactly, that's a strength, not a weakness. The holders actually have to vote from time to time, or consensus rules to mitigate their potential future influence can be applied.

Most of the time people say this sort of thing in ignorance.  
The Bible's texts can be treated like DNA or git commits.  It may have been modified  "multiple times throughout the ages", but we still know what pretty close to the originals where like.  
This is one of the reasons why the Dead Sea Scrolls of the 1950's were such a big deal.  It showed that the texts we had thousands of years later were still very accurate and what gaps there were could reliably be filled in with textual criticism.  
I don't believe in the Bible and I'm not a Christian, Jew, or anything else like that.  It just seemed like this statement was trying to infer an inaccuracy.

What don't you understand about, "Being anonymous is the root of all the other problems."? 
It's not to say that Mt. Gox had other issue that were further up the tree than BTC-e, but BTC-e still has issues more fundamental that what we knew about Mt. Gox.  BTC-e's issues are further down the tree, closer to the root.  
"Mt Gox was well known. "  Somewhat, but we have no idea of what their security was like.  That is why many people said not to use them.  
We also knew that Mark was an idiot, so people said not to use them.  We have no idea how stupid the people running BTC-e are.  
"ANY exchange can make a run for it with your money. There is absolutely no exchange that you can be 100% sure of."  **This is a lie.**  Bitcoin's whole purpose is to avoid these kinds of situations.  We have the technology.  I'll update this post with a link to an exchange that averts this.

Exactly.  DoS isn't a "security through obscurity" issue nor is the 51% attack or issues with large block being propagated across a network, and neither is this.

And Bitcoin keys can't be hijacked?  I don't see how this is any worse.  PoS acknowledges that the utility of the currency system is codependent on the holders.  If 51% of Bitcoins were in possession of malicious players, I'm sure there would be no price correlation since PoW is magically protected from evil by third party miners.  
By the way, I'm sure that the CIA/NSA/FBI/Fed/China/Russia could/would never infiltrate a large mining operation.  I definitely trust a handful of small players bitcoin players interested only in $$$.  
I mean, the NSA's black hole budget alone is only a few billion dollars...

In America, almost everyone I know has access to at least 7.8 megabits/second.  And Bitcoin was never designed to have the full blockchain downloaded onto your mobile device or small computers.  If you don't want to trust a full node, you still don't have to.  Run one at home and you will be fine for the foreseeable future.  
But to address your concern, 


Firstly, you assumed, and wrong at that, or you are knowingly making an erroneous statement.  My advice is not to do that.  
The point of Bitcoin is that I **never** have to trust a third party if I don't want to.  I can always go to the blockchain and look for myself.  Bitcoin doesn't preclude the ability to use a third party however.  
**And** even if I do use a third party, they are still not the authority of the blockchain.  They must still communicate with others regarding the blockchain state.  This is still a decentralized model, even if it is less decentralized.  
This is nothing like America's current monetary system where one entity has the sole power to print money and one entity has the sole power to set reserve rates, interest rates, etc...

I disagree with that graphic.  I think using the term equity, which in my mind has the connotation of fairness in justice because that's what is deserved (like equity in your house), it a poor way to describe that situation.  The graphic also glosses over the situation.  Who brought the boxes?  Who owns the boxes?  If unowned, can they be claimed?  Were they paid for?  Is the tallest one a father?  Is the shortest one a child?  Are the boxes stolen?  The "equity" side may not be "equity" at all, nor may the equality side.
My use of the term egalitarian is not incorrect, although by no means comprehensive.  I am not egalitarian by any means and I disagree with the philosophy fully, outside that I believe that the state, under the rule of law, should always act with consistency regardless of the individuals involved.

Mt Gox has had so many issues.  As someone who was there when they had their first big database breach, they should have died a long time ago.  
People have warned that keeping funds on the exchanges, especially Mt. Gox, was a **really** bad idea.  I thought that the poor quality of the exchanges was already "priced in" bitcoin as well.  Apparently, people arn't as well informed as I had hoped.

I bought my first bitcoins for around $0.88 when the price was below $0.50 from someone on the bitcoin forums using a credit card/Paypal before Paypal started banning digital currencies.  I thought I had to be crazy to pay that giant markup and feared that it would become the worst investment of my life.  
I still remember the initial Mt. Gox announcement on the Bitcoin forums (I didn't have any bitcoins at the time).  I had one of the first Mt. Gox accounts and I was there for the first bubble and hacking of Gox.  Fortunately I didn't loose any of my bitcoins but I never trusted Mt. Gox again even after they sent me a yubi key as a "sorry".  
Once bitcoin GPU mining really started taking off I sold a few of my coins to buy about 7 graphic cards and computer hardware to GPU mine.  At the beginning I was making about 13 bitcoins a day.  Once that fell below 1 bitcoin a day I sold all my hardware.  Sold my cards for twice what I paid for them due to the mining frenzy.  
I sold most of my coins early on believing that cryptocurrency was the future but that Bitcoin would not succeed in the long term and eagerly awaited for "Bitcoin 2.0".  I didn't understand the amazing flexibility of the Bitcoin protocol and now believe that such an event is highly unlikely.  Instead I think Bitcoin itself will continue to evolve and be strengthen by new innovations that will be absorbed by Bitcoin.  
In not so distant history, I also had an early order with Butterfly Labs for their ASICs that I placed with Bitcoin.  Although I ordered early the delays killed my profits and I never came close to making up what I spent on hardware.  
I am still here and plan on using Bitcoin for the rest of my life.  :D

I didn't get an account for a while later.  I was still in the first few thousand of accounts (account numbers used to be sequential.)  By the time of the first hack there was over 60,000 accounts.

It goes along the same lines as that statement.  
Clients don't need to have all the transactions, they can communicate with a full node just to get what they need.  
Full nodes today can easily handle the bandwidth requirements matching the transaction volume of something like VISA.
"Let's assume an average rate of 2000tps, so just VISA. Transactions vary in size from about 0.2 kilobytes to over 1 kilobyte, but it's averaging half a kilobyte today.
That means that you need to keep up with around 8 megabits/second of transaction data (2000tps * 512 bytes) / 1024 bytes in a kilobyte / 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte = 0.97 megabytes per second * 8 = 7.8 megabits/second."

It doesn't matter.  If they decide to take your fund and run, what can you do about it?
@_date: 2014-10-22 15:53:18
It doesn't mention NaS (nothing at stake) by name, but it doesn't mean that it's measures don't help mitigate the problem.  The NaS  problem is more than just being able to stake on two chains at once. It also relates to being able to relatively easily to create forks.
By changing the stake modifier at ever block (if I'm understanding correctly the internals of blackcoin) it makes it very difficult to calculate the exact time of the next proof of stake, making it difficult to make a long chain of dishonest or malicious blocks. After a dishonest node's first block propagates, honest nodes that are rightly next in line for the next stake are highly likely to "cut in line" and prevent a forking of the blockchain, which is what NaS is primarily concerned with.
Of course, this isn't a "cryptographic" or "100% without a doubt" way of completely preventing any problem, but almost the entirety of [Bitcoin's issues and theoretical attacks]( are not directly related to cryptography, but rather how blocks are generated and propagate.

Although I love Gavin, this is something we disagree about.  
I think Blackcoin (a PoS coin) does a great job of addressing the "nothing at stake" problem.   
This is how Blackcoin does that:
    In order to mitigate the possibility of the pre-computation
    attack, the stake modifier will be changed at every modifier
    interval – to better obfuscate any calculations that would be
    made to pinpoint the time for the next proof-of-stake.

I think it is comparable.  Why is there the need for "preconfigured with the identity of the old best chain"?
Consensus is still reached by the stakers in a distributed way.  Why does Bitcoin have the "6 suggested confirmations"?  It's due to the risk of a fork.  PoS coins are no different.  There is a short time when there is a grey area for forks to arise.  This is the designed behavior.  
Checkpoints are intended to relieve any extra fears of attacks (which would be very difficult, if not impossible, to sustain).  They should be removed once a coin is more mature.  Bitcoin had issues when it was first getting off the ground, like the time there was a successful double spending attack on the blockchain that required immediate action of the bitcoin developers to resolve.  I agree, checkpoints are probably bad, especially if they are centralized, but don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.

It's much easier to buy coins, to directly invest in a blockchain, than to invest in specialized hardware produced by only a few and indirectly invest in the blockchain.  PoW has a problem with centralized power while I think PoS avoids this problem.  
PoS changes the incentive of the capital.

Pools are a whole other issue.  
Mining hardware is highly specialized and produced by only a handful of manufactures.  It is an easy target for governments or other nefarious forces.  
A government can dump a few million, or in CIA style do something far worse to individuals, and compromise a whole operation.  Then produce quietly for a few months, flip a switch, and easily 51% attack the blockchain.  I have no way of knowing if the NSA has a warehouse in their back pocket ready at any time to shut down Bitcoin on demand.  
In PoS I always know what kind of attack powers exist because it's all on the blockchain.  If a government/large organization wanted to do something nefarious, they would have to spend untold millions driving up the price to unimaginable heights.  An attack would most likely not be possible in this way because they would drive liquidity to zero.  PoS not only has cryptographic protections, it also has economic protections against these kinds of attacks.

My response:
I agree that Bitcoin's PoW system is it's weakest point.  
Brute computational security would have at least a little difficulty withstanding a direct nation-state attack especially if it was sudden and with little warning.  I do not agree that Bitcoin would be helpless. Bitcoin can evoke many measures to defend against a 51% attack.   To say it would "crumble" is extreme.

I also don't control the factors the make the blockchain inaccessible for the majority of North Koreans.  If those dictating factors are weakened, even slightly, bitcoin potency as a defense and a tool of empowerment for these oppressed is strengthened.  
question also relates to how bitcoin can help those who are oppressed through arbitrary state action.  Although other governments might be powerless to limit blockchain access they may still be able to exert unjust control over individual's savings.  
Bitcoin is a weapon to fight against arbitrary monetary controls.  The point stands regardless.

You can watch the network and see how transactions propagate.  Once certain percentage of nodes show the transaction/certain "trusted" nodes acknowledge it, you can be fairly confident that it will appear in a block.  This can take a couple of seconds.

This is what I'm talking about:


From their website:
The native currency of Counterparty, used for advanced features and representing stake in the protocol.
It doesn't use Bitcoin. Is that entirely necessary?  MaidSafeCoin uses "MAID".   
I don't see any of these services that make their own currency doing very well.  
If you are going to be a currency, be that, and do a really good job at **just** that.  
If you are going to do what couterparty/ripple/maidsafe/others claim to be their aim (which I doubt since they are making their  own coin) then don't try to do other things.  Just do what you do really, really well.  
These quasi coin service hybrids will be replaced by services that use established coins, like Bitcoin, or other future developments.  I highly doubt they will have any measure of broad success.

PoS **is** better than PoW.  I have always complained about PoW even before PoS existed.  I've been in Bitcoin since it was sub dollar and I have always seen PoW as the single biggest flaw in Bitcoin.    
Of the top PoS coins you have NXT and Blackcoin.  I don't like NXT because of it's initial distribution with it's 100% "premining" and it's staking is senseless, so that leaves me with Blackcoin which I think had a very fair initial distribution and it's market cap is very small.  I also like Blackcoin's goals, which are to sidestep the hype, and just be a super solid PoS coin.  I'm looking for something that has long term longevity, not something that is a pump and dump.  
I also hope that Peercoin succeeds as it is also a solid coin, but it is not a pure PoS coin and I don't think its PoS staking as as elegant as Blackcoin.   
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:41:19
I don't like how NXT did it, which is worse imho than PoW.

The act of making their own coins when they could have used those already available shows that they have a smaller intention of complementing over competing.

Nxt didn't have a fair distribution.  I remember when NXT came out and I was really upset with the way they decided to give out coins.  It was like an early Paycoin.  
Also, simple things like a [making a paper wallet are very hard to do with]( NXT.  
Also, since NXT is not in C++/a fork of everything else in the crypto space, I would fear that it's java implementation isn't as well tested as the other clients.  
Also, since NXT clients have little incentive to stake on the network.  Much smarter to just hold in "cold" storage.  
IMHO, Blackcoin is superior
1. Fair, 0% premining distribution via an initial PoW stage.
2. Gets bug updates from other clients/based on proven technology
3. Paper wallets and other things you would expect from a crypto coin.  
4. 1%, very low interest rate to motivate staking and securing the network. 
5. Beautiful, PoS "2.0" implementation.  
Blackcoin was the first coin to be pure PoS after as small distribution period.

The Internet in America today is an excellent example of regulatory capture on every level: local, state, and federal. **There is no free market in America.** How could there be?
The physical space for pipes is regulated heavily by the feds, the states, and local governments. The airwaves are controlled. The devices transmitting are controlled. Local apartment complexes are controlled. Just look at Snowden, the whole system is being squeezed every step of the way. You tell me how we could get to a free market and the free market will be one step ahead of you.
Fortunately, inside those pipe the Internet is still largely free.

I don't see the relevance to what I said above.  


This isn't solving the chief issue of PoW.  Hardware production is centralized, and as long as that remains true, PoW remains vulnerable to any bad actor with similar power of nation states or large corporations.  
What's worse, hardware specialization is still possible over current generation of hardware.  It's only a matter of time. 
For PoW to be reasonable:
1. No significant hardware efficiency increases should be possible.
2. Hardware production should be fairly distributed at lower price points.  
Humanity is no where near this level of advancement, and until these issues are resolved, PoW remains extremely problematic and prone to bad actors, and more concerning, covert nefarious action.  
PoS is a way better and more reasonable solution.  It has a single, (practically) unsolved issue at the moment: a fair initial distribution of  wealth (thus power).  As this issue is resolved (which it is and will continue to be), it's ecosystem will flourish.  PoS takes hardware centralization out of the equation, the largest weakness of PoW.  
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:06:42
Until the people own distributed means of production, this will always be a problem.  
There is no way PoW can ever work when a fab costs 10 billion.  Bad actors will always have their sway involved in something so visible.  
You can't trust the hardware we already have.  This is a gigantic issue.  This is why things like  exists.

[Pregressivism]( at it's core is about using technological progress for the benefit of humanity.  Progressivism shouldn't be about controlling people or telling other people what to do.  Keep an eye on Colorado, we're doing some pretty cool things.  
The somewhat national pigeonhole dogma of "left/liberals" is passe and totally from the cesspool of the Fox News/talk radio cult. I've always admired the Libertarians for being more careful with their speech and using words as the words themselves mean, like the words "liberal, democratic, progressive".  I've also admired the Libertarians for their more open mindedness and willingness to question core dogma.  I hope one day the Republicans can as well, but they first need to rise above their dogma and echo chamber tendencies which have only worsened.  They appear to shun critical thought which is desperately needed for incremental progress.  There are dumb Democrats, but in general the Democrats appear more diverse, striated in their philosophy, views, and education.  The Republicans are more monochromatic, rank and file, cookie cutter.  The Democrats are wising to evolution's billion year lesson: diversify or die.  Blacks, whites, gays, straights, smart, dumb, rich, poor.  
What's worse?  Up front taxes by Obama or hidden inflationary taxes by Trump?  I would argue characters like Ron Paul would see the transparent tax is better and far more lawful.  It's Trump's deficit spending that's far more out of line with the nature of cryptocurrency.  Obama's way is actually a way forward with cryptocurrency.  Trump's way sets the economy up for catastrophic implosion if cryptocurrency ever contended with federal reserve fiat.

I consider myself progressive and I don't consider myself to be a conservative/traditionalist, but one thing I think they get right is this:  As we progress we need to be mindful that evolution (social/cultural/genetic) incorporates seemingly frivolous defenses for a reason.  To discard defenses because "we don't need them anymore" is utter folly.  To mock those who seek defense is arrogance.  We should never treat this diversity with contempt.

I don't think of "value" as a single, fully understandable known constant but rather a vast unknown that can always be better understood.  
Trade is the primary monetary value discovery mechanism.  Through trade exchanges give us a better glimpsing understanding of true value.
The better we understand the universe, the better we will be able to measure value.  On a personal note, I suspect that in the far off future life proves that all things have equal value, ∞.  
But in a less abstract sense "Bitcoin's true intrinsic value (∞)" is disagreeable.  
1. Bitcoin has many substitutions and the evolving ecosystem will create niches for different cryptocurrency and tools that Bitcoin simply can't fill.  
2. Bitcoin's design is not perfect.  Bitcoin's vulnerability through POW to powerful, malicious, fiat producing nation states should not be overlooked.  &gt;50% attack can currently be used to decimate Bitcoin and turn the entire network's clock backwards.  Also, the division between holders and block producers is an another grave design flaw.  I won't mention alternatives, but non-PoW systems with better economic protections I believe will eventually prove to be superior.

Ubuntu does not come with Bitcoin tools by default.  Ubuntu is designed to download them from the net.

Liquidity is Econ 101 and this is what they are refering to.  
People may have had large amounts of fiat on Gox, but because of recent liquidity issues, it is hard for them to move it out.  
Instead of moving fiat out there is another alternative: sell your fiat for bitcoin and move the bitcoin out.  
If this is the case this will drive bitcoin supply down and increase fiat supply, pushing the price higher.  Also, if this is the case, a liquidity issue, then you would expect to see the spread between the price on Gox and other exchanges to be increasingly uneven.  
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:44:36
And the free market will pick many winners, not one.  There will not be a winner in crypto.  This is a huge difference that crypto currencies allow.  Since they are so liquid, I don't care what I am holding, as long as I can liquidly exchange it at the time of purchase.

The proof of work *IS* a huge reason!  
Why does SHA3 exist?  Because it is a stupid, stupid idea to use SHA2 for everything.  Why does SHA2 exist?  Because SHA1 is dead.  Why did SHA1 exist?  Because MD5 sucked and was not cryptographically secure.  
Bitcoin uses SHA2.  
Bitcoin *needs* altchains that use a different proof of work.  Litecoin uses scrypt, which is very different from SHA2.

Yes, on a computer that never touches the internet.  That sounds like a genius master plan.  
The real risk is having non-random wallets, weather that be that the creator premakes wallet addresses so that he can steal them later, or that there is a insufficient amount of randomness that the creator is attempting to exploit. 
Either way, I can use signatures to verify that the software he bundles is trust able if the creator is willing.

@_date: 2013-12-31 18:21:30
If 2013 was the year of Bitcoin, I think 2014 will be the year of the alt-chain.
* On average for the year, the number of alt-chains created per day will exceed 5.  
* The number of alt-chains with a market cap over $100,000 will exceed 250 (Not counting things like Ripple or coins built over the Bitcoin blockchain).  Today it is at 47.  
* Bitcoiners will find many allies in major, creditable alt-chains.  This will be measured by seeing that over 40% of Bitcoin code contributers will also contribute to other alt-chains in the year.  
* Bitcoin will have less than 70% of the crypto market cap share by the end of the year.  (counting only cryptocoins)
* Litecoin will continue to be  to Bitcoin.  
* A solid, SHA-3 based chain will be in the top 10 coins once the standard is formalized.
* Scrypt will take a smaller percentage of the proof of work used in alt-chains.  New key derivation function will become increasing popular.  
* A totally new key derivation function based coin in the top 10 coins.  
* 75% of Americans will know what Bitcoin is.  40% will have been offered cryptocoins or used cryptocoins at least once during the year.  
Other Bitcoin predictions:
- Price of Bitcoin December 31, 2013 (my last year's guess): Between $50 and $500.  I was too low.  
- Price of Bitcoin December 31, 2014: between $3,000 and $17,000.  I see a much slower year for Bitcoin, but still good solid growth.  
- Volatility will drop by at least 30%
- At least one technical scare (exchange or blockchain) will cause a temporary drop in price of at least 15% only to quickly recover.  This will draw attention to the decrease in volatility and confidence in Bitcoin.  
- Bitcoin will reach at least 100,000,000 **gigahashes/second** by July.
-  Minimum Bitcoin fee will drop only once this year.  
EDIT:  Last Prediction:
- Bitcoiners will be less hostile to alt-chains and more open minded.  We can only hope!

I would disagree, as some people don't view it this way.  Ask my standard loving openBSD friends, and they will tell you that fragmentation can easily decrease utility.  


Yes, this can be somewhat true, but it might not be true at all.  If you zoom out there is a bigger picture.  
The total wealth of the entire system increases with each new innovation.  
So although Litecoin may siphon off value at first, the value it adds to Bitcoin by increasing the total wealth of the entire system may just outweigh the initial siphoning.  
Alt-chains are critical to the survival of cryptocurrency.

This quote is not taken out of context.  You are making assumptions that this quote does not present.  Saying that Greenspan has no viable options is advocating his action.
But you are risky to assume that from this quote.  I did however assume that he was making a point that Alan Greenspan felt like he needed to make a bubble.  
Without context, I would not go as far to assume that Krugman feels that this was right.  But I do have knowledge of how Krugman works, and my best guess would be that he favors the idea.

But I think a new blockchain is an advantage for the role litecoin is trying to fill.  For those who see bitcoin as *the* cryptocurrency and want to diversify, litecoin offers the only viable option.  It is different enough to have some value, but not different enough to be based on completely unproven technology.    It also has a much higher trading volume than other alternatives.
