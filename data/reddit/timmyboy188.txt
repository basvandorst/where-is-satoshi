I have no clue how any business can take bitcoin and not want to lose their absolute mind. Bitcoin is such a horrible currency in its present condition.

I worry if we don’t start using these crypto coin’s as their intended purpose, people are going to start to become uninterested as a whole and the value of all these coins will dwindle. Bitcoin worries me the most because it has the most to lose at this point, and it’s technology is nothing special anymore.

Idk, I mean I see it as a win-win. Either I get rich, or get to see him eat his own dick.

They buy in to change the correction to trend upward, meanwhile they’re also betting it will rise... does that make sense?

Just got it!

So what you’re saying is Bitcoin is dangerous, but B Cash will become the standard in the long run?

True. I burry all my valuable shit in my neighbors side lot at night when everyone is asleep.

Wait, so you can get the forked coin if your bitcoin is sitting in the Nano S?

Go see what the Dogecoin car did when it was in NASCAR. 
Probably get the same response with this idea. People will see it, but chalk it up to confusion/ quick thought but fizzle out within seconds.

Can confirm, bought a BTC today. I feel dirty. I’ve been an exclusive ETH for a while, but I can’t stand getting upset when one rise and the other falls. This is much nicer being in 50/50

What research would have gave an educated guess bitcoin was going to go up in value, lol?
It could go back down to 3500 in a month and nobody would see it coming...

If splitting bit coin once again, if you have your stack somewhere where you do not control the private key, you will automatically receive the fourth coins and he pull amount. At this point it’s not good or bad, there’s potential before Colon could become the main coin, but not likely. It depends on which one is more difficult to mine. It’s a hell Mary what if you should sell before or after, previous forks suggest just hold on to what you have and take the fork coin

Crypto sector reaches 200b market cap.
For comparison, the US insurance industry wrote 1.2t in policies in 2015.
We’re roughly 20% the size of the US insurance industry.
This is the big time.

The implications is it becomes basically a commodity (like gold or silver)
The real question is why would you hold BTC is it's only primary focus and drive is based as a commodity. This is basically where my head starts to hurt in terms of buying into BTC, at least for me.

I think the market crashing will cause crypto to boom. Not immediately, but will happen slow, then ramp up quickly. Wall Street and the USD are like the big brothers that have wrecked daddy's car one too many times, and are on thin ice. Little Timmy's been doing great in school and is becoming quite the young man, and the old man's gonna put him in the spotlight once Tommy and Danny wreck that fucking car AGAIN!

So what are all these people doing? You would think if even half bought, it should have spiked prices pretty noticeably, right?
@_date: 2018-02-11 03:07:57
It’s either a store of value or it’s a currency. Bitcoin won’t be adopted as a stable currency to take payment on or be spent if the value is fluctuating too much. In terms of a store of value? 
Why? I guess that’s the real question. It could hit 1mil some day, but I haven’t the foggiest notion as to why it ever would, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it did. 
USD isn’t going away, and if it was ever truly threatened by a crypto currency, the government would intervene in some way.

They blindside dumb people. Plenty of people in finance and real estate knew the housing crash was coming, but the jackals taking out sub prime loans couldn’t see shit but a new home they hoped would be worth double what they paid in 6-12 months.
