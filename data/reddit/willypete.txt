Will difficulty ever drop if demand for bitcoins exceeds the current number of them?

That will give me something to read up on. Thanks.

Is there an opposite to the Dunning Kruger effect, where the totally competent underestimate their own skills and abilities? The wiki article suggests it but I see no further discussion.  
"studies on some East Asian subjects suggest that something like the opposite of the Dunning–Kruger effect operates on self-assessment and motivation to improve:"

Once airmiles become tradeable for bitcoins it'll go mental.

Powershell script set to run in scheduled tasks.  
Have it start/stop the minig program for 4 or 6 hour periods.
Powershell script in logon/startup.  
Script checks process list for mining program.  
Checks that it is running using some variable available in process list.  
If it fails those, restart the program.
More difficult to do.

Yup, that should do it. ;-)

Taking into account the deflationary value of the equipment as the hash mining difficulty increases, wouldn't just buying bitcoins and watching the investment go up offer a better ROI?

Pre-empt. Call the police/DEA and ask them to inspect the premises. You don't want them shutting the power and busting the door at 3am.
