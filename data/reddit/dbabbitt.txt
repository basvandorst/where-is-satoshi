You missed two economic incentives:
* Coders can stop working for charity

bankerfrombtc, this quote is golden. None of these speculators want to put in the hard work to realize their narcissistic visions. Don't let the downvoters get to you.

This makes sense, and I forgot to divide by 1000 for my kilowatt-hours. But my numbers should prove to be the lower efficiency bounds for your profit calculations.
And what you didn't mention, is that you are thinking of a larger scope than I am - that eventually the Hoover Dam Equivalent (HDE) will go down or at least level off.

I'm building an agent-based computational model that simulates the incentives for miners during that time.

I had the same reaction. Plus he is intelligible to the average person, which really made him stand out from the other speakers on the panel. He and Larimer could have done their own panel for an entire day without boring me.

I have never thought about gaming the system in this manner, but downvotes are so powerful in small subreddits. I can see why they would choose this method.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:22:55
Sweet! thanks

This is good work, but I'm having trouble following your math: could you go through the equations you are using?

The quote has the same golden quality as quotes from John Kenneth Galbraith's [A Short History of Financial Euphoria](


It's not that the OP is libertarian; it's that suing for discrimination is in the manner of another Galbraith quote:


public and financial opinion directs at those who express doubt or dissent. It is said that they 
are unable, because of defective imagination or other mental inadequacy, to grasp the new and 
rewarding circumstances that sustain and secure the increase in values. Or their motivation is 
deeply suspect.
When [bankerfrombtc](/user/bankerfrombtc) hyperbolized with "every" and "always" he was directing our attention to the financial euphoria and its side effects.
@_date: 2014-05-10 03:46:34
OK, if they are mining using rigs less efficient than the most efficient rig, doesn't that mean that there would be more electricity wasted, not less? And doesn't the hash rate have to be maintained by proof of work (and therefore can't be ignored)?
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:05:32
Doesn't [secure multiparty computation]( mean that no one has the ability to trace the inputs to the computation?
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:39:22
Thanx for posting the code. In R! Definitely going to use these in class.
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:30:22
You are so correct! Now it's only 0.002 - not so exciting a number.
@_date: 2012-06-27 14:28:04
It's OK to call it fake on a popular level just to get people talking about it, I think.

I had an encrypted wallet hidden in an encrypted TrueCrypt volume on a thumb drive I was giving my son. And then I dropped the thumb drive, probably in a parking lot somewhere. It's like losing $250 USD. That you were going to give to your son. :-(

The form didn't really ask if I was a current user or not.

I'm going to give my 12 year old son an encrypted thumb drive with 50BTC on it for Christmas. He owns about $6K worth of precious metals right now and I think he would be interested in checking out the  website and getting an account. BTW, what's the QR code? Your bitcoin address?

A stock market bubble and another housing bubble. Same troubles afterwards only more bad debt needs to clear the market this time.
@_date: 2013-03-21 14:49:53
I suppose that's true, but I just lately saw that I could buy something I always wanted to buy for what cost me a few bucks. So I spent the bitcoins to get it. Only my wife was pissed. :-)

If I:
1. went to  and
2. clicked on the "Generate New Address" button and
3. clicked on the "Print" button and
4. sent bitcoins to the complicated alphanumeric string on the left side of the paper I printed, below the "Bitcoin Address:" text and
5. followed the instructions at  to import the complicated alphanumeric string printed on the right side of the paper below the "Private Key (Wallet Import Format):" text,
would my wallet show the bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:56:23
Agreed. It was thrilling when I tried it at 88 cents, but I don't want to do that again. And yes, I had to converse with a crazy person.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:02:56
Yep. I haven't read Freedom™ yet, but will before school starts up again.

He has a US bank account, but he is trying to save money. So I guess he'd pay more in bitcoin exchange fees than in bank transfer fees?

It was more for display: I couldn't get Excel to show the dates at the bottom like I wanted it to look. Adding the extra bit on the bottom doesn't change anything.

You've completely cleared up my understanding with this last comment. I wasn't following these instructions for any end goal, I just made up a kind of tour-de-force of how paper wallets work.

How big of a threat do the central banks see bitcoin becoming? It's hard to imagine a more powerful enemy.

I searched through *Accelerando* but couldn't find any reference to the narrow-AI agents needed for a DAC. Stross mentions only strong AI.

Techniques like your central bank is using usually cause bubbles in the stock market or in housing prices. So for a while, you could actually make more investing in stocks than in gold. This will take a few years to play out, understand. Try graphing your stock market in terms of how many grams of gold will buy the stock index. You will see the bubble pop on your graph before it actually pops viz a viz your currency.
Bitcoin, as a kind of digital gold, is at such a small market capitalization that it has not complexified this much. But bitcoin has some powerful advantages over bullion. You don't have to get it out of the country because it already is in no country. Also, central banks are occasionally dumping some of their gold reserves on the market lately, due to something like credit defaults, and this drives down the price as you have seen. You won't see this in the bitcoin market. In fact, it will just keep going up, speculation or no, due to inflation and 3rd World interest.
And you will be able to use it to buy things with. :-)

This is not untraceable. Moving it to a different wallet won't help. Some criminal authority can use social network analysis to find a link to a subpoena-able Know Your Customer-compliant exchange, if it's a case of money laundering. Then it's just following the trail all the way downstream to where you spent some of it, then back up to you.

People are more envious than greedy. Keep that in mind when prophesying post-scarcity worlds.

On your enticement, I read it. Lots of doors. 9 foot tall! Really thick! The author seems stuck in a centralizing paradigm, though. It would be asymptotically hard for the Daemon to centrally control everything like it does in the novel. More likely, lots of small entities would develop that are safe from the insider attacks like those the Daemon uses to grow.
@_date: 2013-12-14 12:47:00
Yeah, it was a mistake on my part to assume there were academic sources out there.
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:47:30
* Bitcoin emerged as a market (catallactic) process and is evolving
* Bitcoin can evolve into money
* Bitcoin can prevent business cycles through inelastic supply of money
* Empirical analysis shows that Bitcoin may be an immature medium of exchange
These are just the points I've always wanted to make but couldn't formulate.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:17:18
The point is not to just see my coins, but to know that I restored them to a wallet. So, if I complete step 5, I will have them in my wallet, right? I'm trying to understand these things.
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:46:01
This has been very helpful. I am going to work on publishing it as an academic paper over the break. All I have is a bachelor's degree - is that good enough? :-)
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:31:41
I put up a Wikipedia article on it. We should start a subreddit about it.

I agree. I just let Excel give me an exponential trendline. I see a slight curve being traced out along the bottom, but I figured this is about as objective as finding animal shapes in clouds.

Yeah, but keep the denomination BTC in the title - that doesn't sound as tacky. Also, you are going to have to do a **whole lot** of evangelism to get the community big enough to create a market.

In other words, it'll get to 20 by July. I've noticed this pattern before the bubble popped. Anyway, it will still be on its logarithmic rise as noted by the line. Speculative thoughts?

There exists within Wikipedia, roving bands of academics looking for original research.


I synthesized Vitalik Buterin's protocol layers with tvtropes analysis of the Daemon book to come up with the architectural principles. This is a no-no.

I'd like to see someone mention that bitcoin is a transaction system that can be used as an alternative to money. That's where the real power lies for the Cypriots.
