Well i dont know electronics or much programming so this was the best I could do
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:53:18

Ues to use the electrum wallet files your computer has to boot of of a usb running bitkey. Otherwise using the qr codes like a paper wallet should suffice as long as you keep the private key of of the internet

Paper wallet. My cold storage wallet works like that partialy.

No. This is my first attempt at something like this I know I could do better in the future.

Why? No one has even heard of this thing and it can't  use the internet. The only way for it to communicate with a computer is through a mini usb cable.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:42:51
I think of a wallet not connected to the internet that holds the public and private keys

About the same as a cold wallet cuz it is one. I have made a cold wallet.
