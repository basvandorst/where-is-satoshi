So much salt. If the network supports this kind of spam, it'll be over soon.

*Yea fuck Bcash*

Can't handle the salt with a fork.

Where do I put my Priv Key from my Exodus Wallet to get my BCH? I gotta invest my $30 somehow!

And if the fee is too high no one is actually using Bitcoin for paying goods in an online shop e.g. Why bother using bitcoin at all then?

Seems like not everybody agrees with that statement anymore unfortunately.

Idk how you can compare BTC to Google, but if you want me to explain that google search service is free, and you don't have to pay fees to use it, then .. well, your argument doesn't even make sense. How you also connected BTC-Price to Google stock price is another mystery.

Ofcourse they are, but only if you bash bitcoin cash and tell the world how bad it is.

What is a meaningful metric when discussing bitcoin scaling?
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:28:55
I think you missed the point. Google is (talking about money) free. They can create user profiles and sell them to companies. But the search service is free.
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:27:49
You're still missing the point. Apples and oranges.

I mean .. yea .. that's my whole point.
