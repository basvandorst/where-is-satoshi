Your train of thought here is that there is a recession where your money (Dollar, Euro, whatever) looses value.
And now you would sell your Bitcoin, wich has nothing to do with the world monetary system in place right now, to buy something that looses value during said recession ?
Na dude, people buy Gold when there is a recession, and they will buy bitcoin in the future.
Wait and see, next recession coming soon(ish?)
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:18:13
So bitcoin will get attacked from every possible angle, even from the within as you see with bcash. Bitcoin has to overcome all These Challenges to truly become an indestructible Store of Value and means of exchange in 2nd Layer.
So Keep your sight clear and Stay in Hodling.

Who cares if it takes years ? Its  a Network and as bitcoin or Facebook it will have a s Curve of Adoption. It will explode, and it will be beatiful

So bitcoin does a wonderfull slow Move upwarts wich gets a little steeper over the last Time... and then suddenly Starts going fuckin zigzag all of a sudden like a fuckin crazy wasp or something ? Sure Dude, Sure.

if they could destroy bitcoin they would have already done so. No doubt about that.
They will fight it tooth and nails, no doubt about that either.
Also, the magic is not that it has crypto in his mind, or that it is not a real life note. your dollar in your bank account are already digital money. So why should they make a blockchain for that, wich is pretty stupid if you have a centralized coin anyway.
No, the power of Bitcoin is decentral consensus.
Go on youtube, type in Aantonop so you really understand bitcoin. watch all his videos and enjoy.

No you cant. Do something about it and stop complaining. Write your exchange, be loud. We dont have a centralized shill company behind bitcoin, we are bitcoin. This is the difference to ALL shitcoins. So fight for bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-01-22 10:48:02
First you have to understand what tether is used for, hint: 
IT IS FUCKIN NOT PUMPING THE PRICE...
Okay lets try:
When people dont feel save in their crypto they can flee to tether wich has its priced pegged to the $.
they can wait the dump out without having to send their crypto or BTC to offramp exchanges like Gdax, or kraken and get real $, but keep them for example on binance, wait the dip and then buy again if they want to.
Thats why more tethers get issued when the price dips. because people want to sell their Crypto and go into something $ish, at least price wise.
So tether IS NOT issued out of thin air to buy some BTC (??) and pick the price up. NOT AT ALL. this is a conspiracy theory by people who sold @ 2.000$ are now ultra fuck salty.
The other, shady thing about tether is: Is every tether backed by a $? I dont know, and i think not.
Thats the shady thing about tether, its probably not 1:1 backed by dollar.
But, IT IS NOT USED TO PUMP BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:19:53
Start with aantonop on youtube to understand the value and possibilities of bitcoin. if you feel that bitcoin is something that sounds interesting enough to buy but you dont know if now or tomorrow, why not buy 50% now and 50% a week from now ?
That way you already have some if it goes up and can keep adding to your stack, or you have some now and can buy even more if it goes down.
Welcome to Bitcoin, i can only say it again, start with aantonop on youtube like many others.
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:58:36
Haha you Baby in your skycastle... go to greece or cyprus then you see what is possible.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:25:17
Dude just chill... remember some People bought @ 1000 and it went too 200. You Think they Sold? No they bought more and are now called fuckin whales.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:40:54
Its not about if it is a problem or not its about the rumor that bitcoin gets pumped by tether wich is BS. Sure Tether is probl. a scam because there are no $ behind it. but everything you talk about in your post was never mentioned in mine, so i think you are just talking to yourself about the things you dont like in tether, so go on.
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:18:26

Who payed 80$ in fees? Come on fudsters, at least try something realistic when talking Trash. 
There is no reason for a blocksize increase to wich we dont know the Full Effects yet.  Make the Transactions smaller, use the Space better. Tune the Code to the Max because After you still have the Option.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:24:03
Dude stfu this happened a Million Times already. Get your stupid fud outa here.

This is mega bcash fud.  Then These miners decide the rules. Less decentralized. More then 21 Million Coins? Why Not only us 10 People get to decide.
Dont listen to attacks on btc People.
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:04:37
Yes, they are.
Coinbase was one of the big pushers of Segwit2x to take over Bitcoin. Now that didnt work, and now they are playing the pissed ones and rather add a million other coins before improving the BTC protocoll.

@_date: 2018-01-05 20:26:53
Segwit is a softwork wich increases the Space Transactions can use in a Block so it kinda already did 
@_date: 2018-01-02 11:10:20
You should have done this a few weeks befor dude.
late to the party, now only hodl is the smarter bet.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:52:32
They want their own Coin to Moon thats Why they Spread fud about other Coins. Try a Wallet with Custom fees and follow the fees in a Explorer, that way you can get super Low fees and dont have to get fucked by Wallet Providers.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:57:57
Keep up the Work Dude. I know you get nothing for it, but bitcoin is ours, and only we can push it forward.

the difference is bitcoin is here to Stay. Your alt has a 99.9% Chance to fuckin die. Check altcoin Top in 2014, 2015, 2016. Every Year some other shit Pumps. 2018 2019 2020 wont be different. The only constant is bitcoin. Up up and up.

Only you can answer that for yourself.
If you want a very good read on the different types of coins and in what to invest and what maybe not, here check this out:
For exchanges there is a list in this subreddit.
Pick one that has segwit enabled so you have low fees and support the advancement of the bitcoin network.
Im 99% BTC and 1% playing with alts to get more BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:56:40

@_date: 2018-01-07 19:09:34
This. Give this a Good Read and then come again:
Tldr: Store of Value is the most important usecase, way above Payment Network wich is being worked on. conservative Upgrade is very very important so the base protocol Stays  decentralized. Be Patient LN will fuckin fuck but there are only so many people smart enough to Build it.

Then they come flocking.  As soon as it is not about % amount of gains but saving your fuckin live savings, then they come. You and many others can be happy they never expierenced this, but my grandparents witnessed the coming and going of 3 currencys, and with them their savings... 
Tis a game for the long run.

First dont Think that that is bad. You got more bitcoin then 99.9% of the human Population. 
Second Yes, many People do this. But it is dangerous. When will bitcoin pump ? Can you Jump the ship fast enough ? The smarter Thing is just buy and hodl. Enjoy the forks, on 23. There are Another Two. And if you Feel you have a large enough amount of bitcoin and you wanna play the altcoin game take 1% and do it.
But dont forget, the Ultimate goal of the altcoin game is to have more btc.

Dont get fooled by the narrative of "core" developers this is Roger shills.
There is an open github for bitcoin where everyone can contribute to the development of bitcoin.
This is where you find the smart minds thinking about bitcoin all day and making implementations.
Fun fact, do you think there is a github for BCH where you can see what they want to do, or the progress?
No, they dont develop it open source.

Good that you gave em business dude /s
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:33:21
Depends on how much you have there. Is it an amount that would Really Hurt you ? More then a months Pay? Then get it Off there and Pay your fee.  If its just a few Bucks leave it and Transfer it some other Time when the fees are lower, After a bull run like this comes a Cooling of Phase thats when you could send it.

Step up your tech game. Use segwit Wallet, use Wallet that has Customable fees. Even at the Top of the pump 5 Dollar was the max for sending btc with my trezor. 
Most important, stop shilling.

Yes its possible both are compatible. And its a fuckin  fraud. From binance to trezor 8 Dollar from segwit rezor to binance (same amount) 1.57 Dollar.
These exchanges are fuckin fraudsters....
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:30:19
Yep probably. He could buy in Everytime it Drops below 16.8 or something and then Sell @ 17250 big gains Everytime. Or just a whale Leaving the game, or  Price suppression.
Lotta People have thousands of btc, just be Patient These will be evenly distributed over Time to smaller hands. This is Good, but it takes Time. Btc is no get rich quick scheme.

People, we need to start pushing the eco system to start segwit adoption ASAP. we have a midterm scaling solution right now, and the community as a whole needs a relieve.
But why should companys like coinbase or wallets start using segwit when we, their customers dont demand it?
So start demanding segwit from your wallets / exchanges, and start using the following companys that already have implemented segwit:
Android wallet: Greenbits, Samourai Wallet, Trezor and Ledger
iOS wallet: Greenaddress.
Desktop wallet, also for cold storage: Electrum, Bitcoin Armory
Exchange : Bitstamp
Only we can demand this change, and we need to demand it NOW
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:12:40
The protocoll, the rules so to speak are governd by the nodes.
So the rules for example that there can only be 21 million coins lies in the protocoll and the watchers of this protocoll are the nodes.
The fewer nodes you have, the fewer watchers over the protocoll.
Think about bitcoin cash. they want to have mega blocks, gigabyte or terrabyte in size.
1 block every 10 minute x 60 minutes x 24 hours with 1 GB block is 1440 GB every day. can your pc handle this ? every day? now you see these blocks can only be handled by the likes of amazon cloud, or google servers. and if these "mega nodes" for example decide that the protocoll should be changed, there should be more coins ? you cant do shit about that, because the nodes, the protocoll, the rules are in the hands of the few and not the many.

if people were really concerned with fees they would write their wallets and exchanges to implement segwit.
that would change the situation and help LN implementation.
Since the just jump reddit to make a post i dont think they are really concered with bitcoin and just shills.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:04:46
No dude, there are 800m USDT in CRYPTO. This is not a problem for BTC alone, if it even is a propblem wich i dont think.

It pushes your Mcburger or Starbucks Buy off the blockchain, wich SHOULD NOT BE on a immortalised ledger anyway !
If you want your buy on the blockchain, if you want to send money on the blockchain, you pay the fee you are on the blockchain.
If you want your Burger immortalised so fuckin be it, pay the fee and your in !
Everyone else gets their micropayments on a sidechain for near zero fee and instant conf.
Another thing, 
you think noobs will wait infront of the McBurger counter for 30 minutes until Mcburger has his 3 Conf? 
LIghtning network is not the easy way of scaling, but it is the RIGHT WAY.
Aantonop your scaling up, and you will be set for the future.

Coinbase is of utmost importance for the noob View of btc because its an entry Point. When they See unrealistic High fees that no One who is into this Space pays normally it scares new People. So we Need to Talk about it and Keep the pressure up.
Coinbase is probably also super super buthurt because s2x didnt get trough, so they could implement other Coins as a Alternative instead of Making bitcoin better by using the Upgrades.
Coinbase, in my View, is a very important and very dangerous Part of bitcoin Ecosystem.

With computer money i mean money that was just created out of thin air because you just got a loan from your bank. This money increases the total supply of the currency issued and deluted the value of the currency. It is not healthy for a currency to create more of it out of thin air, and leeds to inflation, wich is a spiral in the wrong direction. At least in my point of view.

Take 30 Minutes, and watch this video.
The easy way, increasing the blocksize, is not always the right way.
From a technical perspective, we first have to perfect the details of the 1 MB block we have right now to ensure decentralization because this is of UTMOST importance.
If we, after applyed all the technicals updates to Bitcoin still need a blocksize increase, we can still do it.
So, enjoy the Video and watch EVERYTHING Aantonop has on youtube if you want to be a bitcoin pro in the future :)
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:07:25
IF all you think about is other people buying your bags, then yes, it matters.IF you want to send future chinese coins to someone outside of china, you will have to jump the same loopholes as you have to right now. (spoiler alert, you cant)
So same same, with blockchain (only a Public(?) ledger) or without.
With bitcoin, you just send it to me. simple as that.
If that doesnt matter in china, well, we dont have time to help them, they have to help themselfs.
Chinese buying bags or bitcoin price rising is no concern to bitcoin, it works as intendet.

Every time you take out a loan from a bank, that money is essentially created out of thin air, yet you still need to pay interest on it. We are taught to believe that when we take a loan, the bank is loaning other people’s deposited money in their possession. This is simply not the case. Every time a bank makes a loan, new money is created and essentially added to the borrower’s account. Commercials banks can legally lend out 10X the amount of money they have in reserves, this loophole is called Fractional Reserve Lending

(paypal beeing an exception with chargeback)
@_date: 2019-03-04 12:46:50
Its not about paying with bitcoin, its about WANTING bitcoin.  
Imagine this: Kruger understands whats wrong with many fiat currencys and bank/Customer relationsships, comes to terms that owning your own funds and beeing 100% in the clear how the future supply curve is ect. ect., in short likes bitcoin.  
it then changes its policy and gives customers who pay with bitcoin 15% off.  
Suddenly, people will want to have bitcoin to pay with them. this will drive demand, wich will bring other companys to study about bitcoin, giving incentives to customers who pay with it, and so on and so on.  
This is bound to happen, because fiat is so fucked up...

From  
"According to a 2013 report from Thompson Reuters GFMS, it was believed that 171,300 tons of gold had either been mined or was still in the ground. Since there are 32,000 ounces per ton, we're talking about 5.482 billion ounces of gold in the entire world, based on this report. If each ounce was worth about $1,290, the world's gold supply would have an implied market cap of $7.07 trillion dollars. "

@_date: 2019-04-05 15:48:19
building something on top of btc, without destroying the core component, and earning money with it, why not? you are referring to Lightning network, wich is partly beeing build by blockstream. now the thing you dont get is:
blockstream is not bitcoin. and not bitcoin core. a few people working for blockstream are also contribute to core, but they dont dictate or decide anything. there are many people contributing to core. jack from twitter wants to pay blockchain devs, if they contribute core, is it twitter coin? bitcoin cashs main implementation bitcoin ABC is owned by Bitmain, so is it bitmain coin ? 
a company building a second layer (like bakkt does too it seems) wants to make money with it. thats cool, do it too, start a second layer ontop of a decentralized base chain!
miners, who secure the network, fill the blocks with transactions, also owning the code, this would be bad. 
i hope you see this someday, and i hope miners who are also developers never force anything on their community. but its better to know and fight then to just hope.

@_date: 2019-04-05 18:03:57
i think it will be something based on a collaboration of many big players, more like bakkt. they got the power to get companys like starbucks, McDonalds or whatever running their payment network. 
@_date: 2019-04-24 08:29:28
Hey u/Geoku11 ! check out the description in the link, i couldnt do it any better !  
For the really lazy:  
 Outputs per day is a better indicator of  overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than transactions  per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number  of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions  themselves. Large players in the Bitcoin space use batching--the process  of including multiple outputs in a given transaction--to reduce their  overall transaction fees. Therefore, looking at only transactions misses  an important part of the picture. So, we've created outputs.today to  track Bitcoin                outputs.

this is no argument. i hope it never comes to the project you support, but having the people securing the network and earning money with it beeing the same who govern the code and the rules can, and will lead to corruption, because when they could earn more, they will do so. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:51:07
i upvote you because of visibilty. No. perfect the code, build layers ontop. basechain needs to be 100% decentralized. this is the utmost important thing about bitcoin. layer 2 and 3 can differ.
@_date: 2019-04-29 10:48:42
in somewhat 13 years the blockreward is below 1 coin, so its more pressing issue then people point out.
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:46:47
no it is not. having only miners decide whats the way is the way to centralzation. miners give a service, and recieve payment in form of fees and the blockreward for that service. giving them also the power over the software (the rules) is absolute cancer. 
think about that: you got 5 big mining pools, all require their members to run their node software. big miners meeting: well, 21 million bitcoin is nice, but 42 million is nicer. we want a larger blockreward!" since they are the one running the software they just change it. pangpuff, 42 millon coins is the new rule. you dont want that? well fuck you, we own the code and the hash!
we need everyone who wants to, to be able to run his own node. they need to be able to verify their own transactions and also to make sure that the rules cant be altered by one side of the bitcoin Economy.

First of all, use this bear market. educate yourself, to give the answer next time ! try to help people like u/KalEll66 ! 
Knowledge is power, and by understanding how bitcoin transactions work you are a millenium ahead of all the people around you.
So lets go:
Transaction fees are calculated by how big they are, now how much money is in them.
Look at this site:
as you can see, the median transaction size is around 226bytes.
The fastest and cheapest fee to get into the next block is around 14satoshi per byte, so 3164 satoshis fee for our median transaction. This is around 0.17USD right now.
If you dont need a confirmation in the next block this can go way lower. 
(as low as 1-2 satoshi per byte, easy)
So the above mentioned binance transaction was around 5981byte, so way, WAY larger then your average transaction. this is because it probably is thousands of smaller transactions put together into one wich makes it larger.
This is the reason for the 7 dollar fee, since you still have to pay the tx fee per byte.
So your 4 dollar transaction wont cost you 7 dollar, because it probably is way way way smaller then the big binance transactions.
I hope you got it, and i hope you bookmark the site. you can check there if your wallet is overcharging you in fees at any given moment you want to transact.
Cheers !

Dont attack him personally just because you dont like his post.  
with virtually unlimited supply he probl. meant that we can produce it trough natural means, like waterpower, sunpower, windpower ect.  
But as long as china is powering up one power plant after another without using the energy they produce to the fullest, they will have alot of excess energy that is cheap and that will be used by miners because bitcoin gives them an economical incentive to do it. If this wasnt the case, they wouldnt be mining.  
Bitcoin doesnt care either way, it can function perfectly one way or the other.  
In most western countrys mining wouldnt be profitable right now because energy is way more expensive.  
So they dont do it, or find a way to make it economical.

Can we get a sticky for a few weeks? 
I know the video of Greg Maxwell is also super important, but its way more in depth technical then this.
Lightning on the other hand is probably the biggest addition to the bitcoin network since its invention,
And this video of Andreas tackles a few of the common Fuds about lightning.
So sticky this up Mr Mod !

If People dont understand bitcoin Why even Argue? Bitcoin doesnt Consume electricity, miners GIVE it to the System. If there is less, then the System adjusts.

@_date: 2018-02-02 06:28:31
You shouldnt have talked to them that you have  bitcoin, or even how many you have in the First Place. What you should have done is educated them. 
For example like this: Hey Co worker, Let me ask you a question, how does the Money System in our Country Work? Have you heard of decentralized consensus? 
If you cant explain it yourself you started wrong with bitcoin, go back to Square One and Watch aantonop on Youtube.
You want more educated hodlers and not stupid moonkids in this Community.
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:21:28
As you can see, monetary policy in our system is only led by special intrests of the people in power. 
The monetray policy of the fed only brought you, and this is just the US as example, this: 
In europe its the same, its everywhere the same.
This is no problem for people who own other assets like companies or real estate. But for people who keep Money not only as a medium of exchange but also as a store of value are just totally and completely fucked.
maybe bitcoin right now is not suited to be the world currency, but with sidechains, why not have a chain that has the propabilitys your economie needs?
The good thing about bitcoin is that we dont have central authority making the calls, but consensus among the network.
This in itself is 100x better then the way it is right now.

always DCA. so you get cheap coins and still can buy more if it goes lower.
DCA = dollar cost average, take your amount and split it.
Exmaple: 1000 dollar split into 250 250 250 250.

Well how would you state it? Theres a race for the next block, and everyone wants to win. you dont HAVE to put in more ASICs, but theres a competition out there so they do.
But like i said, bitcoin doesnt demand the miners to give it that electricity.
The miners do it out of competition. and if the competition dies down for whatever reason, bitcoin can still run fully normal even with less.
The media always puts it like bitcoin network has to consume so much energy. No, it doesnt. it could consume way less energy while functioning the same. miners GIVE the energy to bitcoin.

this " hodl shit" is very important to teach even the smallest mind that bitcoin is one of the only Things that if treated correctly no One, absolutely no One can take from you. Bank Account Money? gone. your car? gone. your Gold? your House? gone.
Why should someone take something a way from you is Not the question, because around the World in the last 80 years there are various Times These Things have happened. my grandparents witnessed the Coming and going of 3 currencys and with it their savings. so Keep on hodl, i like that Phrase.

1. Why does the price have to be stable in a peroid of price discovery ? The dollar value crashed 95% since 1990.  
How many $ were printed yesterday? No one has any fuckin clue. The european central bank printed around 2.5 Trillion Euros to buy up government bonds, thats two thousand five hundred billion Euros just printed. You say there is needs to be mass confidence dude, in Fiat there is mass delusion. 
2. The price of Fiat Money, of gold, of real estate, of bonds, of stocks, of every fuckin thing gets manipulated. this is a non argument.
3. Dont know what you want to say with that one
4.Where do you see that adoption isnt happening ? wich metric, is it hashrate, wallets, applications, community participation (reddit ect.) isnt pointing up? Price? we just deflated the biggest bubble yet, this is up tremendously over the last few years.
