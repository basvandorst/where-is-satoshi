How much of a problem would it be from a technical side if some would become so efficient at creating collisions that he could take control of a substantial amount of wallets? Is that something where one could switch to a different way of creating key-pairs that would protect against this, or would that break Bitcoin altogether (or all blockchains relying on asymmetric encryption)?

What exactly does that mean though, can someone explain the details? My question basically is, what do these trading stops do if the future contracts are to be settled in January to March next year?

I figured they just go for a buckshot approach and see what sticks. I raised the issue of patents and possible patent wars around here before but nobody seemed to concerned, same experience at meetups. I find it very counterintuitive though that incumbent banks filing all kind of vague patents is not a threat to the blockchain environment. People can claim they outpace these banks all they want, in the end of the day most projects are advertised with clear names, and most users have to interface with entities tied to their real identities like bank account or the likes, and that means aggressively enforced patents affect what they can do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:00:30
But that means as a security measure it is only build for brief and extreme moments of odd price movements, for a market where such movements come about regularly and an asset (for example Bitcoin) can go up or down by 20% within a day, it really is just window-dressing as a measure of security?
Also, are derivatives usually bound to the opening times of stock markets, or can they usually be traded 24/7?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:09:22
About the self-certifying issue, so in the end all futures that are exclusively settled in cash are so to say asset agnostic. In a sense you give out a future for a certain volatility, not an asset,, and the CFTC just asks if you can handle such a volatility and how you make sure that there is no market manipulation?

Pretty sure that this is not a positive situation for the long run watering down Bitcoins "brand identity". It also might lure away a lot of hash power if Bitcoin Cash becomes more lucrative. People said such and such about being committed to the 'real' Bitcoin, but words are wind when money is in the way.

The statistics involved in this study are not just taken from looking at raw facts but they are highly interpretative. When you look at the underlying study, which is linked in the article, they just took the following search terms to find correltations:






Which I find to be a very plumb selection and also indicates a very narrow understanding of the topics. I would definetly consider Silk Road to be an libertarian project to some degree, for example.
I also do find it odd that they don't seem to take into consideration what articles have been published about Bitcoin at the time to see in what direction that would steer the search interest. Aside from that, there have been other studys that came to conclude that many people who got into Bitcoin around that time, viewed it primarily as an asset which is a conclusion that is very contrary to this study.
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:27:40
You are throwing together two very different concepts of being *backed by math*. Cryptography and statistics both involve mathematical concepts, but we are talking about very different things right now.
In statistics much depends on how you build your categories and the way you construct them drastically changes the outcome you get and often it makes sense to check how someone did construct his categories to understand what to make of a study, instead of just taking their conclusion at face value.
In this case, I do think it is very problematic to compare such a specific search term like *Silk Road* with an unspecific search term like *making money*. The researchers can not directly messure what got people interested at the time so they have to pick indicators from which to make inference about the underlying unobserved community. That is a process of interpretation and in this case I believe it is a bit of a stretch how they did it.
Aside from that, there have been other studies on the topic for the same timeframe such as Glaser et al - "Bitcoin - Asset or Currency" where they compare the transaction volume of Bitcoin with the volume at some major exchanges and came to conclude that many people just buy Bitcoin to benefit from it as an asset.
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:07:30
I think it makes a lot of sense to think of Bitcoin as a political project. Nowadays economic performence is frequently taken as the prime indicator of successful politics and the right to create und distribute money, and respectively propertie plays a major role in this, which again strongly relates to the role of debt.
Even when it is unintended technology frequently has strong political effects like opening up new paths to participation, monitoring or interaction for example. You can not talk about creating a new form of money withouth addressing questions of just distribution, propertie or the right to control it.
Nowadays it seems like politics has such a bad image that many people don't want to run what they do under that label, but I do think it often is politics in denial.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:41:39
But what is the problem with shorting Bitcoin without selling on exchanges, won't the price be unaffected by that (other than people interpreting a short as an expert expectation or something)? How could they "short us to death"?
The trouble I have here, I think, is to wrap my head around people selling futures in one place parallel to people selling the actual commodity on exchanges. How could trading futures affect the price on exchanges unless people buy or sell Bitcoin there? I mean, isn't Bitcoin a strange case of a future because people regularly trade not a representation of something, but the actual commodity (Bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:25:54
Well, thanks for that. So, people trading futures are doing so unrestricted by actual supply (at least sometimes?)? Someone could buy futures over 30 million Bitcoin despite knowing nobody could deliver that "commodity" but just settle the issue with cash? Can futures always be settled in cash, or could someone still insist on the delivery of the commodity?
How does shorting work than though? Don't I need to have access to the commodity to sell it, or wouldn't it at least be in my interest to actually sell it to push down the price?

Might be an amateurish question, not directly my field of expertise, but isn't that a very risky thing to do with something like Bitcoin where markets are still not that liquid and the amount really available for purchase (not the fictional 16 million, but what people really trade) is opaque and largely nontransparent? Is that something you don't have to worry about with the CME?

@_date: 2015-07-27 16:13:59
I am not sure if some of these questions are already off topic but I would like an answer to the following questions if possible:
1. Is there any technical use to a Proof-of-Burn or is it really just meant to display a certain commitment to an altcoin or solve questions of distribution?
2. Does anyone have a good explanation on how exactly altcoins like counterparty, which are being pegged on top of the Bitcoin protocol opperate? I am looking for something that is not too technical but still more complex than just speaking in metaphors (e.g. I am looking for something on the level of the Nakamoto whitepaper of 2008). 
3. Is there any way to realistically exclude dishonest miners from Bitcoin, if for example a nation state would invest into large scale mining rigs with the intention of disrupting the network (or any other actor with massive funds that can not be coerced to stay honest through financial self interest). I guess this would just be a variation of a 51% attack but I never saw it come up when people say that states could not shut down Bitcoin.
4. Is there any reliable merchant that really does pass on the cost savings of dealing in Bitcoin? Especially one that can be accessed from germany?
5. Is there any source on how companys like Bitpay achieve liquidity?

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:22:03
It's not so much about intrinsic value or not. I think functioning money in itself is an intrinsic value in a society in which you cannot partake without money. I just find it strange when people respond to comparisons to manias or bubbles by pointing to a price chart saying "look, its not a fraud because the price is really really high now".
I have observed this for a few years now, and over these few years has seriously regressed from a good source of information about ongoing developments to a place to share price memes. At the same time hardly anything has changed regarding acceptance of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, while people celebrate more and more people buying in for the sake of it, and financial institutions preparing futures and other problematic derivatives.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:44:34
I am pretty sure the same thing happened with Bitcoin cash. People got extra capital as an airdrop and many simply bought Bitcoin with it, upping the price, again making others claim the market responded positively to the fork based on Bitcoin increasing in price...

The fees were taken out of the wallet, not the transaction, I was just surprised regardless. Of course its also a problem with Breadwallet that I can't set the fees. However, people around here often whine allot about this and that, so I kinda took complains about fees with a grain of salt.

Someone cares to explain what it means for cryptocurrencys if market manipulation is deemed illegal?

You could always show them a gold price chart:

An overdraft is a negative number on some spreadsheet an little more. Calling it theft would be a tremendously liberal use of the term.

And so did any other crypto... looking at coinmarketcap and seeing how anything that remotely resembles a blockchain having nothing but a website and some grand promises tenfolds in value is very telling about the general crypto environment.

It is a very good game with a vibrant community, but it requires a ridiculous amount of time to get good at. You literally end up flicking through youtube vids on orbital mechanics to save enough fuel to make it to planet XYZ. You can mess around with stuff a bit and crash a few rockets, but otherwise it is a very complex simulation.

Nothing puts the mind at ease like the benevolent oligopoly of Ethereum (much unlike the quarreling oligopoly that is Bitcoin).

Which is kinda what is wrong with Bitcoin as money...
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:28:28
But if there is a Bitcoin fork, will there be replay attacks like Ethereum had, or was that something specific to Ethereum? Isn't it the same problem that a signed transaction is valid on both chains?

There will be plenty of room for firms that view proper regulation and compliance with investor protection as an asset. Once there are firms that comply with such transparency requirements everybody can decide for himself if he wants to instead invest with some Nigerian prince promising him the moon and beyond.

What about Google or Facebook terms of service? It's just text till a court decides otherwise, and you might have a hard time finding any court ruling that the terms of the ongoing ICOs have been anywhere near reasonable.

Bitcoiners believing they will see the upside of highlighting dangers of cash to regulators has been one of the most delusional aspects of Bitcoin history.

Dunno, but I used a Bitcoin ATM in Canada once when I was strapped for cash and my bank card wasn't working (funny enough). I withdrew about 110 Canadian Dollars. When I made another attempt the machine only offered another 40 Dollars. Figured the machine might not stock much cash to begin with.
Overall there is just about no reason to seriously use a Bitcoin ATM to make everyday purchases, unless you bought in so low that the conversion rate basically doesn't matter for you. It was a curious experience though.

But they are not...

Overdrafts are extensions of credit, not theft, and they are certainly a lucrative business for banks. Modern banks are not massive money bins where they shuffle around coins. Pretending they are something of the likes contributes to mystifying banking and moralizes valid criticism of rent seeking practices as described by the OP.

That is when segwit is starting to mess with the timeline (a feature, not a bug though).

So... if Bitcoin splits, will there be replay-attacks like Ethereum had?

Exchanges? LocalBitcoin or the likes?

Non of these have a strong argument on their side. There is virtually no reason to horde tokens for future use. People clearly buy expecting future profits and openly complain when prices fall.

Well, let me clarify I guess, any source that does not stem from divine intervention.

Funny human. :D
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:42:36
Yea, but I don't get the impression price surges should be mistaken for signs of "everyday use" or even votes of confidence around here. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:56:57
Yea... when people call it "self-regulation" somehow it always ends up sounding like they just are afraid that this ecosystem will run dry of people more gullible than themselves buying whatever token they are hording.
Nothing here self-regulates and when things go inevitably sideways for one reason or another people are somehow always much less excited about "self-regulation" than they were when the good times were rolling.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:58:18
You just keep telling that to yourself.

When is Litecoin being used ever?
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:05:23
Millenials have always been on the losing end of this development to begin with. Seemingly free services have left them utterly dependent on platforms willing to harvest and commercialize every piece of data they produce. People keep talking about the entitlement of millenials, but underneath the superficial smugness exhibited on the web most of them increasingly find themselves in situations were they labor for free themselves, or find it increasingly hard to find steady employment, service their debts, and so on.

Thanks, however I was hoping to also find some coverage that also deals with changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as new exchanges opening up, organizations accepting donations in BTC, things like that.

In that case the best investment would be canned food and an AK47... sometime I get the impression people around here just overestimate how well the end of the world would work out for them...
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:40:07
Yes, sure, it might be worth such and such and even more, but I was referring to the "for everyday use" part. I don't even mean to slender Litecoin in particular, but so far it seems no cryptocurrency made it anywhere near "everyday use".
