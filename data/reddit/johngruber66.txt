I've been watching binance all week/weekend that was a short squeeze. there is barely any actual buying like in May-June to warrant this meme.

He deleted everything but in a nutshell: use vpn or tor and Wasabi or privacy coin and there's no way they can follow a trail. They have contracts with government agencies all the big ones and their work has led to hundreds of arrests

keep dreaming. absolutely zilch happened during the last halfening. it was as big a letdown/hype as Y2K

I've been in this space since 2011, trading options since 2015 since bitmex went online. the last halfening jack shit happened and bitches on reddit were wining about it. the price ratcheted up slowly over the next few months naturally not because of the halfening. it literally has zero effect on price.

They have  a debit card and  direct deposit so now you basically don't need a bank

they don't trace you unless you're part of a criminal investigation. but any exchange, if it's legit (like Gemini) and based in the U.S. will report to the IRS over a certain threshold. then if you don't report you will get tagged automatically. if you cash out through a private individual then you don't have to worry about that as much unless that person is being watched by the feds.
