That is absurdly expensive for a Caribbean property.

Yeah, 20% loss over 30 days isn’t bad at all!

Even then, I don’t think it’s that great. I have to do a fair amount of transferring currencies around every month, as I get paid in USD but live in a foreign country.  Apps like TransferWise make way more sense than BTC for people like me.

I would like to know where Coinbase gets there info, because it goes deep.  I was asked about an address at a place I lived at for 2 months about 10 years ago.  I never used that address for anything official, and definitely not as a mailing or billing address.  I've received multiple 10 year FBI background checks, and that address has never shown up.  Yet Coinbase found it.  Very strange.
Anyway, it took me multiple tries as well.  Lots of crazy things I either forgot just never heard of.

Well, it had to happen eventually.

Yet if they are trading cheaper than Mt. Gox, there will probably be thousands of users flocking to that "exchange" regardless of security loopholes.  BTC-E supposedly has a lot of "issues" regarding security, but it doesn't seem to be affecting them aside from a lower trading price.

I played around with day trading a little bit with LTC and PPC.  It wasn't a lot, just enough to experiment.  I made some, lost some, and then about evened out.  More importantly, I learned it's a lot harder than it looks, and requires almost constant observation of the market trends.  Interesting way to make a buck, but I'm still not sure it's for me.  I found the fees really chip away at your earnings more than anything else.

Don't feel too bad.  Several years ago a friend of mine was telling me about bitcoin.  I can't remember exactly how much it was worth, but something less than $1/BTC.  I was thinking about buying a couple thousand, but then kind of forgot about it.   Could've been a millionaire!  Oh well...  I could've invested in DDD this summer too, but didn't.  I didn't guess the recent powerball numbers either.

Well, I woudn't think so.  But I've already stories of this very thing happening at BTC-E, yet they're still going strong.  
Either way, if they only have a couple thousand invested, what's the downside to scamming even a few hundred coins?  Are there even laws against stealing BTC?  I really have no idea, it seems like a strange area we're operating in right now.

You don't want to screw around with that.  It sucks giving Uncle Sammy his cut, but just do it and move on.
