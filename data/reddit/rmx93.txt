ikr, random people around me could talk about crypto everyday at the gym or in game etc. now everyone is quiet.

Ask yourself why didn't you buy BTC when it dropped to $3000
People still didn't learn to not buy when it's spiking up, you buy when it's on the bottom.

Whales always have to take some profit so dips are always there

r/outside is leaking

Almost buy time
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:49:49
It's still rock bottom
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:02:20
Lesson learned, buy only when the price is falling.

Lol 3 BTC is nothing here's lot of people holding BTC from 2015 and 2016 on this subreddit.

Even if it stay at $5000 till 2020?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:43:21
Ohh the times when you could mine 1 BTC per day so easy.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:48:51
Don't be so sure, there's more coins better than BTC it's just a matter of time.

"10,000... Thats quite a bit.. you could sell those on ******* for $41USD right now..
good luck on getting your free pizza."

Bitcoin support line is on $3000 so no way it can fall lower than that. Even if its gonna drop to $4000 then most of us knows it means sale-day :)
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:00:33
Another dip? buy buy buy
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:34:31
Well played, I still hold my since 2017 when it was $3000
