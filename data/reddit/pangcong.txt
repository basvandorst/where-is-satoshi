People are scared actually now in China. They are a step behind the information outside. Block size limit fear is spreading in China.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:27:01
You will see how fee rapid increase when the block is always full. You will cry, soon. But you can get no help from core. Their way is too slow.
@_date: 2016-01-24 13:06:08
Well done, China!

You will see how fee rapid increase when the block is always full. You will cry, soon. But you can get no help from core. Their way is too slow. Besides, we need more people to join bitcoin, the core road map will block a lot of people because of the slow transaction and high fee
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:31:40
Strongly Agree!

So the price up!

how to go public
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:05:24
let go back to your definition, when talking about active developers supporting the roadmap, you say "Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on" , gavin's commit two in Sep 2015 and one in Feb 2016 but you say "Gavin is active for years" I see clearly you are playing double standars, you lier!
"Gavin, Jeff, Mike, they are not experts in Bitcoin Core" tell me your name, I will open a new thread to help you post your opinion.
"Meetings have topics they are not just about anything. Core has no current plans to develop a hard fork so it doesn't make sense to waste time discussing something they have no current plan for," you are helping core lying again, hard fork to increase block size will never be talked, here is your father, gmax's message
@_date: 2016-06-28 14:50:40
"I don't know, but you can make more votes if you want"
You even donot know it how can you trust it?
"They have the most developers by far of any team"
You can not deny core leaded by gmax drive away lots of developers ,especially hard fork supporters. 
you are  ignoring this deliberately.
"I didn't say Bitcoin has no competitors. But you don't win a race by looking behind, you win by doing the best you can do."  No what we see is nothing expect core leaded by gmax do something benefit his company by limit block size, and benefit the competetors like eth. This is not win by look behind, 
"This is just an accusation, there's no proof. I could say that you are making trouble and spreading rumors just to benefit your altcoin. I don't have any proof of that either. Anyone can make up rumors" you say it is an accusation, but i see is truth. Two fact, 1,  GMax is doing his best  to limit block size. 2.blockstream can benefit if bitcoin block size is limited.  Dare you deny that?  This is not rumor, this is truth. That two is enough. I  think gmax is the biggest altcoin supporter since their company benefit from side chains, and you should know what side chain is.
"Soft fork is faster and safer. They tried for a long time to have a hard fork, but there is no progress. But the soft fork has had a lot of progress, many people support it. Anyone could help speed it up if they wanted to by encouraging people to support it more or writing more software for it"  dare core import classic's hard fork code, we let users choose by themselves, we just see which is faster. "They try a long time for hard fork, there is no progress." are you joking? Core leaded by gmax is doing everything to prevent it. Dare you let the code merged into core and see what happens?
"There's no need to fight, people can just disagree and go their separate ways if they want" I agree there is no need to fight, we can just watch gmax fight.
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:13:22
If you are not lying here, we have common interest.
But you have lied so many times, i really doubt
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:01:48
You can just wait and see what will happen next month
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:42:37
There will be a war if still on  progress on 2MB Hard Fork at the end of July. It is not a joke
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:50:37
I edit the question on the vote, please have a look again.
core certianly has their own opinion and their opinion is most respectful, but users have too. Core can choose to ignore opinions from users and abuse their power and force everyone to accept their own, just like the King. And yes, I admit it core is the King, the real King. Then finally there will be a war. The war I have said at the very beginning of this post. So we just come back.
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:28:09
Must I repeat it? How long does SegWit take from implement to fully deployed?
Must I repeat that it is suboptimal but not most appropriate?
Must I repeat that sw even may be dangerous with so many modification?
how many active developers,and how many of those developers work for blockstream? how many of them is working on Lighting network? 
And Please tell me, what part of that roadmap come true now?
Don't you realize that roadmap is a well-planned hoax to cheat developers and the community?
Please do not use the excuse that it takes times for developing ,testing, blablabla
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:29:24
This is a reply to a core supporter, because people are very angry at what core has done
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:21:20
gmax should be the greatest fighter, he can fight to expell gavin and mike, he can fight to persuade luke to give up 2M hark fork code.  can he fight with the whole community? @_date: 2016-06-29 03:37:39
luke has contract with bs,he admit it himself. and you still didnot answer these question, how many of those active is more active than Gaven? how many of those active work for or worked for or receive salary from BlockStream? 
All those 94 countributors signed the roadmap? I think you know basic counting?
Two fact, first,Gmax is trying his best to limit block size using all the excuses of a traditional developer , seconde, limited block size benefie Gmax's company
@_date: 2016-06-28 09:05:38
"It not a good idea to do an elective hard fork unless the activation for it is in versions way ahead" That's the time pow works, miner has the power, that is What is said at the beginning, if core developers eat their words, there will be a war, the inner voting mechanism works.
"I don't think any smart investor would invest in something that could change" that is why i said you should go to see the real world.
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:10:31
I do see Gavin made a lot of countributions. Satoshi later also said the limit should be removed in the future. You should understand what 1M limit is for.
That roadmap is the main problem. There is no clear hark fork plan. And even now, in the core meetings, HF is off topic.
Do you still believe the roadmap when it turns out to be joke?
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:46:41
"There's no good way to measure code in "more" and "less". It's like saying what is a better book, the longer one or the shorter one? Well that is just too simple to make any statement"
Are you really developer? You are behaving not like a developer, but a politician.
 "Core has stated " So whatever core said, they are right? Not even without a chance to try? Why you behave so blind?
"The fastest fee is still about $0.10, not too high."  Don't you understand  even $0.10 will push lots of people away? Especially those beginners. In China, the rmb transaction fee is always 0.
The worst is not just fee, but the money of new inverstor which should come into bitcoin never hasitated because of the current blocksize limit
"average block size on 06/27 was 777k, on 06/26 it was 762k" You do talk about average. A very simple math logic, the average can never be full, can you understand it?
@_date: 2016-06-29 00:53:27
"The soft fork code exists, if people want it they can use it" the question is "How long does SegWit take from implement to fully deployed?" this is the third time i repeat it, you really behave like a politician
"Only some work for Blockstream, not the maintainer of the project and not many important contributors like Peter Todd or Luke-jr" only some? as i see, it is seven or nine?  luke admit he receive salary from blockstream, stop lying please.  and i repeat the question, how many active ? how many of those is more active than Gaven?
"SegWit came true, thin blocks came true, CSV came true" are you joking? Segwit come true, in april? you see now, that is how core cheat the public. where is the code for thin block, where is the most important  2-4-8?
"Gavin hasn't been active in years, just the facts. He stepped down, he's not contributing. He doesn't even code on Classic. Just go check the git if you don't believe me..." you lying again, the last commit of gavin in core is Apri 20 2016, then it is Sep 30 2015. Now tell me, where do you get these facts "hasn't been active in years. He stepped down, he's not contributing"? Where "years" come from?
Try not lie please, i have told you i am a developer. Admit it or not, a developer standing higher than you if you are merely a core developer. But i think you are not, a core developer should not have so many time on a forum.
I repete some questions again, how many active ? how many of those active is more active than Gaven? how many of those active work for or worked for or receive salary from BlockStream?
Take it seriously, try not escape!
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:55:25
You never said? "100% of the active developers that you see on those commits are on board with the SegWit plan" this is your original words, buddy!!!
Then I ask you how to define active developers. And then repeat 
when talking about active developers supporting the roadmap, you say "Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on" , gavin's commit two in Sep 2015 and one in Feb 2016, gavin's total commits is 485, more than most of those roadmap supportors, but you say "Gavin is not active for years" I see clearly you are playing double standars. Lier, do you agree you are playing double standards?
"Gavin, Jeff, Mike, they are not experts in Bitcoin Core" tell me your name, I will open a new thread to help you post your opinion.
"Meetings have topics they are not just about anything. Core has no current plans to develop a hard fork so it doesn't make sense to waste time discussing something they have no current plan for," you are helping core lying again, hard fork to increase block size will never be talked, here is your father, gmax's message 
Finally, three facts you can not deny, 1, GMax is doing his best to limit block size. 2.blockstream can benefit if bitcoin block size is limited.3,limited block size is harming good user experience
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:07:28
how many active developers,and how many of those developers work for blockstream?
He do support,support 2M by SW,support a suboptimal method but not the most appropriate. In the road mao,he mentioned 2-4-8 hard fork, it is good, at least he mentioned it. But finnally we know why he mention it, the road map is totally lying, so they can get through the conference. It turns out to be true now. Hard fork is offtopic of core conference. Thanks to their team member luke, we know everything. Don't they feel tired lying so much?
you talked so many, i think you can see all these things too, why do you cheat yourself?
@_date: 2016-06-28 15:44:36
"Core isn't interested in that kind of Bitcoin-- one with unbounded resource usage which will likely need to become and remaining highly centralized-- and doesn't write software to bring it about." this is the words from gmax, now do you know what i think in the road map won't happen now?
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:31:16
“Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on. The maintainer of the project works at MIT. You can see the commits here, that will show you who is active:  Very good, catch you lying, in this definition, Gavin is not active? In this definition, how many of those 54 people are active?
And still a question, where is the mentioned 2-4-8 since hard fork is off topic in core's meeting?
Two fact, first,Gmax is trying his best to limit block size using all the excuses of a traditional developer , second, limited block size benefit Gmax's company
@_date: 2016-06-28 09:44:27
i will.try. But most people do not vote, you know roger is a classic supporter, does he vote?
"There is no clear future if we go by whatever a few miners decide" true, But there is also no clear futue if  we go by a few developers decide, and those developers  do not understand what user need.
"Bitcoin has far more investment than any of its less "limited" competition" the limit will not stop investment, But ITdecrease the investment
"No one is restricting Bitcoin except for themselves. You can raise your own limit as you like" people do see core is limiting it, especiall greg maxwell. the Most secure method is to raise by core, supported by core. But core need to provide an option, as we see, core never provide, some developers even plan to violate HK consensus. we all know, blockstream opposite 2mhk, we all know if blocksize keep small, bs benifit
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:45:07
"As fast as people want, the code is already written"
Are you joking? Please answer the whole question!
"Just your opinion, not a fact"
The same to you. Your opinion , not a fact
"how many active developers,and how many of those developers work for blockstream?“
"100% of active developers. Without them there are very few others"
Please answer the whole question, the later one
"SegWit and thin blocks so far have code and are part of master"
So you tell me what is the roadmap for SW. And answer the question again, what part of that roadmap come true now?
"Every active developer agreed to it. They don't have to, that's just their opinion. Every single active developer, everyone"
You are lying, how many of those developers are more active than Gavin?
You only complete one of my questions. And your answer is  "Just your opinion, not a fact" 
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:19:12
This is not the excuse that core do nothing on a hardfork to scail bitcoin, and expell those one who are for a fast scailing from developing team
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:16:35
Are you ashamed of lying again and again?
You dare not count, I count it for you!!!
 54 support including Adam Back, what a joke! Does these guys represent all 94 contributors? You continuously repeat all, why are you so eager to make the public believe the team leaded by Gmax represent all?
You said road map is supported by all, Now tell me, why so many oppositors?
Dare Gmax let all the developers resign a road map, with an opposite option?
Now I give you a chance again. How many of those 54 guys are more active than Gavin? And How do you define active or inactive?
"Greg's company built the increase to the 2mb block size that will arrive shortly, so they are not limiting it, they are expanding it."
Can you understand English?  Tell me what the meaning of Gmax's words in the followling link
Two fact, first,Gmax is trying his best to limit block size using all the excuses of a traditional developer , second, limited block size benefit Gmax's company
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:37:40
Not like that, I'm saying that you are playing double standards. You just ignore it and talk other things. Below is the logic and truth, all our conversations are there, I also made snapshot in case you modify or delete it.
when talking about active developers supporting the roadmap, you say "Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on" , gavin's commit two in Sep 2015 and one in Feb 2016, gavin's total commits is 485, more than most of those roadmap supportors, but you say "Gavin is not active for years" I see clearly you are playing double standars.

"Gavin, Jeff, Mike, they are not experts in Bitcoin Core" tell me your name, I will open a new thread to help you post your opinion.
"Meetings have topics they are not just about anything.

there is also proverb in Chinese, 先礼后兵。
core can do what they want, that is true, if they think they are the KING
@_date: 2016-06-28 16:10:24
no i want it to solve the most urgent problem in current situation, but in gmax's words, there will be no 2-4-8, there will even be no 2. Is him insane? How can core be leaded by such a person?
i agree with sw, but sw is not urgent. it is suboptimal method but not the most appropriate, sw even may be dangerous with so many modification.
I think you should have already realized gmax has been lying so many
@_date: 2016-06-28 06:09:05
The one who is really fighting is core, fiighting with their partners fighting with the community. The community choose. If community can not choose, there will be a war
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:30:42
Certainly we know it, 2Mb wont solve everything. But which is faster or safer? What if sw is another DAO? The  purpose of 2MB is to give bitcoin more time to developing better methods like sw, lighting and side chains. We need a hard fork to solve current problem, but not sw, light or side chains to solve future problems. The problem is the sequence, do you understand?
Besides, as said, 248 road never occurs since that road map, hard fork is offtopic in core dev meetings
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:08:19


yes he is not  die-hard advocate, but people like him will leave.
This is what I said core is harming the society
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:27:16
the vote expose public keys, besides, how does it work?what if i use different address to vote, i transfer coins between these address, i have 10 coins, but 100 address, i can vote 100 times. And what does "desided" mean in that voting, does it mean people can not vote any more? can we revote? if it is three month ago i will also vote agree on "If non-Core hard fork wins, major holders will sell BTC, driving price into the ground", but now i will vote not
"We should not go by what a few developers decide. Sometimes there are not easy answers. If we have too few developers, we should try and get more" core is doinb very bad on this point, they drive away a lot of talented developers but not attract. 
"Anyone who is investing for the long term of Bitcoin won't care too much about short term problems. Both a hard fork and a soft fork get to the same place, just different ways" you are wrong,  there are competitors. You do not meet user requirements, users can choose others, short term limit will drive people to other coins, donot you see how fast eth grows. even if eth met some problems now, it is still strong. Bitcoin comes first, comes first does not mean to be first for ever!!! 
"Easy to blame someone else, rather than yourself. How many of these people are even contributing anything to the Bitcoin Core project?" this is not the excuse to abuse their power to limit block size and benifite their company.
"There is an option, 2MB through soft fork. It does the same thing as a hard fork, just a different way" we already talked about it, it takes too long, and lots of risk since so many changes, there should be more tests, even after sw release, it still takes long for the market to accept it , please have a look of the actual market. hf first is faster and safer and gives plenty of time for core to improve and test sw and other staff
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:08:16
What a childish man are you when you keep asking people "What is the answer of 1+1" and then you give the answer like a winning baby "It is 2".

You think I know nothing? But you met the wrong person
@_date: 2016-06-28 08:12:53
ok,  for the same condition, the same developers and reviewers, more code mean greater potential of bugs and risk, do you agree?
If core develop HK and SW, which is faster? dont blind your eye please, say the truth.
Most people do not know the average fee. It is very obvious you are in lack of dealing with users.What matters is never average. It is peak. User experience is very important at peak. you are developer, me too. And the company i once joined went from 1M usd to 20Billion usd in four years.  Please go out of the data, go to the real world!!!

So you admit your double standards, very good!
"You actually think people actively contributing to Bitcoin Core right now are against the roadmap?"
I do not know. But I know there must be someone against it, those who has been expelled or choose leave because of Gmax's leading. I know you are wrong when you say "100% of the active developers that you see on those commits are on board with the SegWit plan" . I know the society is against the roadmap. The voting on the roadmap show it. The posts on show it, and the votes on those posts show it. Then censorship of show it. The HK consensus show it(what a ridiculous consensus, no HF code means no SW deployed, but it shows how eagerly the society is hoping for a instant blocksize limit increase, and how stubborn the core is)
three facts you can not deny
1, GMax is doing his best to limit block size
2.blockstream can benefit if bitcoin block size is limited
3,limited block size is harming good user experience
@_date: 2016-06-29 04:45:19
Do you admit that you are wrong when you spreading rumors say "Gavin hasn't been active in years" by your definition of "active"?
“The opposition to the roadmap has no active developers - just non-experts. You can find plenty of non-experts to support anything.“ Have you counted it? You really checked it? Then what about the voting, how many are fake?
Two fact, first,Gmax is trying his best to limit block size using all the excuses of a traditional developer , second, limited block size benefit Gmax's company
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:49:32
Yeah, I do hope so. However, it depends on if those core developer keep their words
@_date: 2016-06-28 05:40:17
The nodes make no sense at current situation,China know HK consensus. They will continue to support core before the end of July
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:27:40
i think i have to repeat it, i also add a new sentence regarding to your so called 2 commits
lets go back to your definition, when talking about active developers supporting the roadmap, you say "Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on" , gavin's commit two in Sep 2015 and one in Feb 2016, gavin's total commits is 485, more than most of those roadmap supportors, but you say "Gavin is active for years" I see clearly you are playing double standars, you lier!

"Meetings have topics they are not just about anything.

@_date: 2017-01-25 09:42:01
i agree with him
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:00:45
So you mean all those 2M hard fork supports are not experts? Gavin, Jeff, Mike are not experts? Only those people lead by gmax are experts?
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:26:01
F2Pool support big block. Chun just use it as an excuze. Core developers cheated him in HongKong consensus. He is just fighting back. It is impossible for F2Pool to support Segwit without bigger block
@_date: 2016-01-22 11:16:09
Because most Chinese are angry at Bitcoin Core, the core do not improve size limit. It means we will have to hard fork to classic.
@_date: 2016-06-28 00:30:20
very good, you just pushed your biggest supporter in miners to the opposite
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:17:16
I know it. He also know it. And He is still right. Never support Segwit without actual block size limit increase. You need to think deeply about it and try to understand why miners do not support Segwit even it can somehow "increase block size"
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:59:38

it is nonsense. recommend you an article
@_date: 2016-06-28 07:46:57
More code mean greater potential of bugs and risk, do you agree? If segwit is faster, why do we need to wait so long time? How long? I think you should have the basic knowledge of math.  Meanwhile, It only take one month for classic's HK code to be ready
HK was successful once, we already have experience. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:27:34
F2Pool support big block. There is nothing to do with c++11. Chun just use it as an excuze. Core developers cheated him in HongKong consensus. He is just fighting back. It is impossible for F2Pool to support Segwit without bigger block

We are not talking about what gavin said, we are talking about what you said.
Once again, Do you admit that you are wrong when you spreading rumors say "Gavin hasn't been active in years" by your definition of "active"?
"Everyone wants a limited block size except some people who are not experts" So Gaven, Jeff, and Mike, etc , they are not experts, right? What is your definition of experts?
"2/4/8 doesn't require a hard fork, and it is a plan for the future not for the present" What is a meeting for, a meeting is to summarize the past discuss current and plan future, you say 2-4-8 is future, now tell me, where is the future in such an importance non-irc developing meeting?

you let me repeat it again
when talking about active developers supporting the roadmap, you say "Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on" , gavin's commit two in Sep 2015 and one in Feb 2016, gavin's total commits is 485, more than most of those roadmap supportors, but you say "Gavin is active for years" I see clearly you are playing double standars, you lier!
"Gavin, Jeff, Mike, they are not experts in Bitcoin Core" tell me your name, I will open a new thread to help you post your opinion.
"Meetings have topics they are not just about anything. Core has no current plans to develop a hard fork so it doesn't make sense to waste time discussing something they have no current plan for," you are helping core lying again, hard fork to increase block size will never be talked, here is your father, gmax's message 
Three fact, 1, GMax is doing his best to limit block size. 2.blockstream can benefit if bitcoin block size is limited.3,limited block size is harming good user experience

"Miners don't have the power to hard fork." if or not, you just wait to see in the next month. IT is not just miners.
"In the real world, people don't trust a few random miners with their money. You can make that type of coin if you want, but I definitely don't want it" in real world , wise people do not inverst something which has no clear future; in real world, people do not invest things which are limited; in real world, there is not just wise investor, there are more stupid investors. also in real world, people do not trust those guys who restrict bitcoin for their company benifits, as time move on, more and more people will come out. In real world, What matters is not average, IT is peak

the community do come to hk consensus, but it does not work on core
@_date: 2017-01-27 04:45:23
so, increase block size limit is not allowed, while decrease blocksize is allowed?
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:06:18
What about decrease to 1k, I think 1k is better than 300k

the second largest ltc pool is against segwit.
Besides, segwit with ltc is conditional, hard fork code is together with segwit, LTC will hard fork to bigger block size at the time of second half

BTCC is famous for its worst technology among all the exchanges in China.

there is no relationship. Yuan's sink is two days before bitcoin surges. the price move of bitcoin is an instant reaction of viabtc's anouncement

Every chinese know this matter. BTCC's technology of trading exchange is worst among all.

it is strange, bitcoin is "attacked”, but price goes up. I don't think it is "attacked", the market just told us, it is good news. Very good news!

This is because of HK concensus. 
By the way, I just send some sentences you said to the Chinese community.

Peter, or the one behind Peter. There is no evidence to prove "Wright is not Nakamoto", why do you get a conclusion so early? What if he is finally? Some guys are  so nervous that Nakamoto may occur, Why?

Their model can learn by itself, basically after removing first two similar phishing sites with Manual intervention, it will remove others automatically later on.

Yes, thank you Bitcoin Core, for telling the unvarnished truth about the hardship, turmoil, lost funds and chaos that ("contentious") hard forks invariably entail. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 15:36:09
Do you know that what you are doing is harming bitcoin by spreading misinformation?
I'm from China. I can just tell you the common sense in the Chinese Community of Bitcoin. No one likes BlockStream now! People in China all know that it is Greg Maxwell who is blocking bitcoin by limiting block size. I dare say, your company can never develop any  business in China in the future.
