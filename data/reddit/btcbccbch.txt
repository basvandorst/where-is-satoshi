They constantly complain about censorship, but, in reality, r/btc moderator u/BitcoinXio , is heavy handed in censorship too! u/evoorhees - please note - free speech is NOT allowed on r/btc - especially if you have something positive to say about upcoming hard forks (free dividends) of Bitcoin.

I am a staunch supporter of Bitcoin BTC. I think Bitcoin.org needs re branding, as the website is looking very dated / ancient.

I think that the hard fork is actually very bullish for Bitcoin BTC, as it removes extreme hash power fluctuations.

Excellent - I am really pleased to hear this.

Ledger hardware wallet will also allow you to split your coins: " we’ll let our users trade on both chains and split coins easily, even if the ride might be slightly more bumpy due to the fact that Segwit2x was not initially designed to cause a split." Source: 
Trezor hardware wallet will also allow you to split your coins: " If you have held BTC on your TREZOR before the fork, you will own the same amount of BTC and B2X after the fork." Source:

When I said that China was a threat to Bitcoin, I should have said that the Chinese Government was a threat to Bitcoin. The Chinese people that I know, and talk to, share my views, love Bitcoin, and wish it no harm. I am strongly against any Government AND / OR ANY group of miners that want to take control of, or harm, something that I personally have invested my hard earned money in.

Segwit is clearly working as my transactions are being confirmed quicker than before, &amp; the fees that I am paying per transaction have already decreased substantially! As more exchanges &amp; wallets start using Segwit, the more the fees will drop. We no longer need Segwit2x. Why create a problem in the community &amp; try  to fix a problem that no longer exists?

The Chinese Government has tried to derail Bitcoin, which it considers a threat to their economy, and is considering banning Bitcoin Exchanges.  THIS IS A GOOD THING, as I believe that they are not good for Bitcoin in the long term. 
The Chinese miners have already proven that they are not to be trusted to act in the best interest of Bitcoin. In reality, they are also not acting the best interest of their own pocket, by creating so much uncertainty, thereby reducing the value of the very thing that they are mining and making money from.
I hope that China does ban Bitcoin completely and bans the miners from mining in China. This will create a market shock, and allow me to buy more Bitcoins at a lower price. It will also reduce the power of the Chinese miners, as currently, I believe that they have far too much power / control! I am really pleased that Japan &amp; Russia are planning to start mining Bitcoins as this will diversify mining globally which is exactly what we all need. 
I personally bought a cloud mining contract, 9 months ago, and was so worried, as I thought it might be a scam, but it has already paid me back my initial investment... however, I do not plan to invest any more money, because they withheld payouts for a long period of time, in August of this year, &amp; caused me far too much stress!
I only started getting into Bitcoins over the last 9 months, so I need much more time to buy at lower prices... as I believe that long term, the value is going to much higher.
Segwit is clearly working as my transactions are being confirmed quicker than before, &amp; the fees that I am paying per transaction have already decreased substantially! As more exchanges &amp; wallets start using Segwit, the more the fees will drop, &amp; prices will therefore rise!
We no longer need Segwit2x.... NO to 2X - please try and persuade everybody that thinks otherwise.

Thank you Slush. May the force be with you.

99% of people that have purchased Bitcoin, do so, purely because they believe its value will rise will rise in the future.
