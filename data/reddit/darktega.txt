Tomorrow is gonna be a good day, right?
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:50:18
Where is that prediction tho? I'd like to see it, haven't been on reddit for a few days.
@_date: 2018-09-01 21:47:40
I'd set my goals at 7.6k as it seems that's the level of the 200 EMA currently. If we can break that then it just means good news for us and for everyone who wants to come in.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:00:22
Lol, there is a chance Mexico will join the LATAM financial crisis too in a few years. Wait for us!
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:51:11
Eh. We are still in a good place. Just look at the weekly chart and overall, the monthly chart.
With every up you should expect a down.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:49:31
 Oh right! It's labor day in the US right?
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:58:23
Mmm, why exactly? I'd think that in monday people will be like "I can finally buy some bitcoin because banks can do transactions now!" or something along the lines.
@_date: 2018-09-05 00:28:51
I think more than a sign it would be confirmation. There are definetly many signs that this is a trend reversal. [
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:36:30
Yeah, I still go into overdrive after this kind of thing, but I try to relax and look at the big picture first. 
Of course, what you wanna look at depends on your position and your strategy, and even if not, every piece of data you can get it's important as it can present you with information of what could happen next, but, c'mon now at everyone calling 6k even before we hit 7k this morning.
@_date: 2018-09-08 20:09:51
In weekends, the prices are usually in the hands of algorithms and whatnot. People and overall, big participants are usually away doing weekend stuff not putting that much atention to what's happening.
Buuuuut that's just a theory.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:17:43
If you don't mind, could you PM me or post here if mods let you where can I get this book?
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:04:04
Most probably. It's just a correction to being oversold.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:46:32
Yeah it's probable! I'm still positive about the long term of course. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:13:55
Edit: I read the post I was answering to reaaaally wrong. So I just erased my original response.
For an actual answer:
For me, it's not about "affording" it, it's just about trying to maximize the return by buying cheaper knowing that there are risks involved but that there will be a big reward if all goes well. By buying cheaper that reward increases.
I agree tho, that there are people that are probably just waiting for the coin to be at 500 USD or something and are probably never buying.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:45:38
No, we start fearing again. :D
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:26:47
Let it be known that if we bounce really high then Alessio Rastani has his third eye wiiiide open.
(In reference of there being the signals of when it's appropiate to enter the market by predicting the probability of bounces and stuff)
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:14:44
Buuuut wasn't it fun?
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:32:09
Short term, medium term and overall, long term, the graph says we are good. &lt;3
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:03:21
Your answer makes me think I might be actually playing Darkest Dungeons, honestly.
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:06:17
May the crypto gods listen to you.
Actually I'd be really happy if anything bigger than 6.3k is the floor, seeing how it has been going on this week.
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:50:57
We did broke for a whole three minutes.
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:17:49
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:41:54
ROFL. Thanks for that. It's lovely. &lt;3
And I feel like your idea is better too but I was thinking too much about the cat and not bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:57:59
You are so woke!
Edit: Actually, if we could fake rallies and keep dropping until after next week so I can keep buying that'd be nice.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:41:54
Of course, it's part of the fun.
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:47:05
Yeah, it's nice! I just hope that in the weekend the bots behave themselves.
Edit: The market is about to close 4% up, which isn't that organic per se, but it's nice.
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:46:45
Oh, of course, but US would need to have some kind of special luck to be in that situation. Right now US seems relatively fine from outside at least.
I'm worried about my own country (Mexico) right now, specially with the new elected president, ROFL. Guess I'll get to see if my investment in BTC was worth it. \*Nervous tremble\*
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:40:53
I have little experience in this, but what I can say is you can't just expect for your money to grow from one day to the other, and even one week to the other it's still a little to short of a period of time to say anything for sure. Although I'll say you bought at kind of a bad time (even if 07/24 was a green day) because many things got together for BTC's price to drop. (Expiration of CME's contract and BTC's ETF rejection everything in last week's second half) I mean it would be bad if you were here exclusively for trading.
If you are here for the long run then there is a good chance you will end up on the green if you play your cards nicely. What will be pivotal is if ETF's proposal gets accepted or rejected, so put attention in that in the future as that may play a big role for BTC's general future, so yeah, that alone may be the start of something beautiful or the infamous end of the line for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:04:20
Is this another Bart?
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:54:08
What does happen exactly every time we hit 6.5k, does a massive selloff occurs or what?
Edit: FTR, already irrelevant comment.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:52:55
\*Buys bitcoin at 0.42 USD in december of 2021\*
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:18:41
Doesn't it goes both ways? I love bitcoin and everything, but refusing fiat when a big part, if not every one of your customers use them it's kind of a bad marketing strategy.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:21:14
We officially hit the bargain phase of the five stages of grief.
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:14:58
Most probably a bunch of experience. He talked about an specific pattern a few months ago, I put my attention and kept looking for these patterns, saw it a few days ago (The "closing under the 21-day average in red twice" plus a probable false breakdown) and if this is a reversal with potential of going higher, then that's definitely it.
If it doesn't bounces accordingly well then F me ROFL, but if it does, wish I wasn't out my investment budget.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:33:39
Let's hope it's that way!
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:03:28
BTC is going to have a correction at some point. It's gonna drop, but how low it does it's what will define what we have right now as a flub or the new floor.
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:48:19
I think we can afford to go down to 6.45k, as the tendency has been lately something along the lines of having first a big percentual pump, then we go down next day or so but stay above the opening price of the day the pump happened, ensuring our steady way upwards.
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:04:52
Don't get scared or get emotional for a 3% drop, and risk taking bad decisions.
Edit: Mostly that.
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:15:41
Now I can use this "��" everytime we are on the rise.
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:58:42
I hope so too! It's one of his rules about "good timing to enter the market". He states that *almost* always when the market closes two times in red below the 21 day average then it's a signal that some kind of increment will happen soon.
Edit: Or something along those lines, I don't remember exactly.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:20:13
Got it! Thanks.
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:43:00
ROFL, I hope so. I'm just waiting for some of my buyings to become profitable.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:28:18
Actually 7 minutes.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:52:03
Yeah, also this. Before bitcoin I was considering investing in a bank but the return is so little for the money I have that it doesn't even cover annual inflation. Yes, it is better than just having money under my mattress but I'm willing to take risks so I can have a better return.
@_date: 2018-08-17 22:03:59
Request for a photo of a cat with the caption "Hang in there" to be made a Bitcoin hanging above 6.5k.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:36:17
Lol I know, I have my little share of bitcoins and everything but my bitcoin budget is still dry from july. I need to wait until the first half of august ends to buy more and I wouldn't see a better time than this.
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:35:46
The price not moving at all in the last 6 hours is really refreshing.
I feel in peace.
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:32:36
It happens, now you are stuck HODLing with us. Muahahaha!
For real, tho. It's not like bitcoin doesn't have the word "Risky" all over it's face.
(I rebalanced at that same price because I bought at 6.3k but then buy again at almost 8k)
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:37:25
Yeah, BTC "dropping" from 6.5k is talking about a high up that lasted like 6 hours at most.
Edit: Also I should mention that we have been stuck between 6.2k and 6.3k almost as much as we did a month ago.
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:03:02
Oh, of course! I have the patience for that, it's just nice to see some green.  ��
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:32:22
Okay seems fair and reasonable, actually.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:21:00
6.8k resistance broken. I know I'm late to the party but... Now we are talking!
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:37:06
Who will downvote my comments when they disagree on a opinion with me?!
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:49:30
You force people to sell cheaper or buy higher because there is no way someone will actually buy or sell 70 BTC if you want to buy or sell in the moment.
Edit: Mainly panic selling or FOMOers, for the record.  
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:22:30
Yes! Bitcoin dropping hard it's a possibility, but the probability of it happening it's really low.
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:57:58
Was it BBC or CNBC the ones where the news indicated the opposite direction Bitcoin will go?
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:25:13
Don't panic yet, reddit. We had a closing of almost +4% yesterday so a correction was expected, the important part is that said correction doesn't put us lower than the opening yesterday, and so far it hasn't. We are still up from from our lowest point this month and up from our lowest point in the year. Remember that climbing a mountain isn't a straight shot up, there are ups and downs. We will have to see some red before seeing some green again.
The organic grow everyone was talking about happens on the long run, meanwhile we can expect to see crazy things happening like yesterday and crazy things happening like today. Remember that this low happened on a weekend, where the price basically falls in the hands of some bots and algorithms, so drops like this or worse are to be expected.
TL;DR: Chill, we are good.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:22:56
If I learned something from watching Alessio Rastani videos is that if BTC closes below the 21 day average today (which it looks like it), then it's probable that a bounce up is going to happen soon.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:51:24
Well, I mean, that's almost the "obvious" thing to do. Buy cheap, sell higher and repeat.
Buuuut, we are humans, we panic, we sell when we shouldn't and buy when we shouldn't, so we have to make a rational strategy without emotions involved and stick to it!
Sure, if you can pull the "buy cheap sell high" classic strat, then you are a god.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:12:29
Eventually when or how much lower will we go in your opinion?
Because I mean, that's a true statement in any point of time by any amount of money.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:47:50
Lol, nothing that matters. It's kind of a joke because anytime I posted something that was not positive towards BTC, he answered every time and coincidentally my karma would go down.
I still liked him. &lt;3
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:39:17
It's painfully hilarious.
@_date: 2018-08-01 15:22:34
That's something I really like about bitcoins and cryptos in general, I think anonimity is the biggest point for me when it comes to adopting cryptos.
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:47:02
I think you should wait a while. No one can say that a bottom has been hit as of this drop. There are many speculations that a drop to 4.5k could be the next target, but obviously no one can know for sure.
What is probable is that a bounce can happen and just then the price could drop again.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:37:46
The thing is, a couple months ago it was unlikely. The panorama changed (with BTC just going sideways and not really anywhere, then all the BCash stuff came along) and so it became likely, and well, it happened.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:30:10
Yeeeah, you are right. I guess I was blinded by ETF (although it is well known at this point that the thing isn't gonna be approved until the limit is reached and IF it is approved) and Bakkt.
Although, for those same reasons I think the the future will be interesting to say the least.
@_date: 2018-11-18 19:35:38
I know, it's because of the RSI that I called a bounce, but usually the price could go lower after the bounce happens, that's what I'm talking about.
Anywan, today is another day, see you there!
@_date: 2018-07-19 21:27:57
Hey guys, any opinion on **Bitso**? I'm using this platform because I live in Mexico and it's pretty straightforward, but I'd like to know if I could be doing better.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:14:59
Just sharing my learning experience so far. :D
It's interesting for me to see how the "whales" actually affect the market, like, I didn't even notice how a guy selling 40 bitcoins in Bitso to a cheaper price than most basically puts everyone else in a position where they have to sell cheaper or wait for him to sell his 40 bitcoins for them to actually sell something. (The system works so the cheapest offer is the next one that gets sold) So this "whale" is basically controlling the market and putting prices by just blocking everyone else.
I'm actually really new to this, so don't mind me at all, I'm just excited about learning about how the market works!
@_date: 2018-07-29 18:06:26
Well the weekend hasn't ended yet in some countries, so anything could happen like last sunday, still.
That being said, if it does end like this then I think it speaks well of what is waiting for us in monday. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:36:34
I don't think I'm grasping the concept of the Mayer Multiple. (Sorry I'm quite new at this, trying to get my own lambo and all of that)
Is it a reference to know where the BTC price relates to it's historical average? (Where said average translates to a mayer multiple of 1.00?)
So, how do I really read into it being 0.82 right now? Is it being below average a cause to buy BTC or should I wait for it to go back near 1.00?
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:11:11
Yeah, if anything it gives us a chance to buy more and have profit later. I actually tried buying some this morning because I didn't think it would drop that much and I'm making a loss from that particular batch lmao, but well, that teaches me a lesson.
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:54:44
Thinking deeply of investing a little more but my investment budget is already dry. It's really tempting to creep into other parts of my budget but I have other needs which I'm saving money for. &gt;\_&gt; (Said other parts are not my basic needs budget but more like my "other not crucial but might be nice to have" things budget, just FYI)
I'm a student tho so I might be doing some rebalancing next month I get paid, I'm trying to get into this for the long run.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:21:53
7,900 USD which is like 158,000 mexican pesos. I'm a happy man.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:20:17
If I can only afford another 5% drop should I be packing my bitcoins and trading them?
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:12:03
Volume was low in the weekend because well, that's how weekends usually go I think.
Right now I think we are doing well in terms of volume.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:04:50
Joined last week the day BTC had the 10% increment and went immediately on the plus after my first buy. Had a lucky strike.
Much love to this community, it's been really fun! &lt;3
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:55:33
Well, glad I HODL!
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:10:26
You all need to chill and HODL. 
"\[...\] history shows the price of bitcoin drops 7.89 percent on average in the five days prior to a contract expiration. "
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:37:42
I'd like to know in what parts of Mexico are those ATM at.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:56:52
So either we HODL or we abandon ship any second now?
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:25:33
Yeah, that makes sense. Although that's never been the usual since 2017 for Bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:59:54
Well I guess I did a good investment and will try to do more. It's funny because yesterday I YOLO'd my first BTC purchase and hours later the 10% increase hit. I guess it's no coincidence that the Mayer Multiple was as low as it is right now.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:36:08
On the bright side, volume already looks better than it did yesterday.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:48:24
Could you detail this a little more?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:08:17
Mayer multiple is at 0.94. If someone is hesitating to buy BTC right now I'd say it's still a good time. :D
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:12:40
Isn't it determined by the average in a period of time? More precisely so.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:01:40
Is a little red here and there healthy for the bitcoin? I don't mind seeing red after all the crazyness we have had last week and in monday and thursday, if anything it seems just normal.
I'm still on the green but it could be greener I guess.
@_date: 2018-07-30 19:35:24
\^ Yeah I'm actually curious.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:44:23
Okay so this dropdown is an interesting learning experience for me. I always bought bitcoin so far at whatever price the platform put in front of me (In Bitso that is) so I tried to go for a fixed price to sell to see if I could break even in one of my BTC purchases I did days ago, but nope, I would have to sell at a higher price than a guy that sells 40 bitcoins.
I'll just hold then, I'm not doing any trades today, ROFL.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:40:38
Nah, that's not the case, I'd just like to walk away while I'm still in the green.
Although I gotta say it's tempting to just HODL. I don't mind losing the money.
Edit: Grammar.
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:18:34
Now that's helpful, thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:54:35
That just goes to show how much people panic. :P
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:25:30
Can someone explain what's going on? Is this price manipulation or what am I missing?
