Yeah that's theft.

should be this sub's new name.

You want to use cold storage. Use paper wallets or buy a trezor. Only keep small amounts available on your phone or computer for use. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 03:33:29
Do you have one to sell?
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:20:47
Sorry this happened to you! This happened to me last year. [About $14k worth]( I feel your pain. Still no idea how it was stolen. I know it went to a blockchain.info address, but their system prevents them from knowing who owns which address, so the trail went dead there.

Muh pasta
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:06:49
So did they ban your account while you had 5k-10k stored in it?
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:50:50
I would pay for this! Too bad :(

So no magstripe...I guess I can't use it here in the US

Yeah all this infighting makes me glad my money is in LTC.

I agree, it shouldn't be a govt issue at all. Just stating what his stance is.

He is against abortion and gay marriage which most consider as religious extremism. However he supports handing those issues off to the states rather than implement any laws at the federal level.

I always wonder if these guys really understand what the blockchain is, or if they just use it as a buzzword to sound smart.

So now I need to beg the US T-Mobile to do it. Got it
@_date: 2015-03-26 12:09:09
Out of curiousity why would US deposits not be allowed?
@_date: 2015-03-28 11:41:15
I'll mod
@_date: 2015-11-18 10:44:31
They make $400.

Funny that the 21 Inc pre-order hair dryer is in the list. And a Chromebook...wtf amazon
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:45:56
I play CS:GO and have yet to understand why anyone pays for skins. They don't increase any stats. They just make the gun look different. That isn't worth more than the cost of the game itself, let alone 10 btc
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:05:18
Dark Wallet has warnings all over their main page about it being in alpha and how you shouldn't use real money with it. So this doesn't do any good now
@_date: 2015-03-24 12:38:13
Do they support litecoin wallets too?
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:44:46
I don't get it
@_date: 2015-03-04 05:34:08
Just moved away from Utah a month ago. Maybe my old reps will still care about my opinion?
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:04:00
I used it multiple times with no issue last fall. I see no reason to avoid it
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:16:20
Let us know if you find the owner!
@_date: 2015-10-10 13:29:00
I paid with a credit card and still had to wait 7 months to get my Jalapeno. Made pretty much nothing off of it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:12:16
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for my two titans I bought last august. Actually i think it was june.
