- IT is supposed to a solution for the bitcoin high fees by transacting on a different network called LN you pay entry fee = normal bitcoin fee and you transact cheaper and when are done you exit the network you pay bitcoin fee 
- you move your BTC for LN use LN then back to BTC
- also  :
super cheap in relation to bitcoin mainnet fees. super expensive in relation to cpu usage and risk to be involved in (rollback)-activities that (may/will) cost you real BTC because someone used you as a node...
Simple ones i could find 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:16:22
Yep sorry fixed it
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:08:40
You will change to BTC to LN coin and use it there so you are paying a normal bitcoin fee to swap BTC to LN 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:18:50
that is what i am asking where can i put my money where LN can be supported in the future and cheap fees

An SPV wallet like one powered by bitcoinj connects to bitcoin full nodes and gets blockchain data from them. It doesn't download the whole blockchain. It trusts the peers when they tell it that a certain chain is the longest. unlike other wallets this connected to the blockchain rather than a wallet server/ so if u make a transaction it goes directly to the blockchain there is no middle man that connects you to the blockchain AFAIK

This is just a different way to use a wallet has nothing to do with fees 
This a bitcoin issue not wallets you can pay low fees and if you are lucky it can take hours or days or weeks in some cases 
you can use a wallet which offer low fees or custom fees but when you choose low fees it will take time to confirm, samoruai wallet , BlockChain.info, coinomi offer custom fees (YOU set the fees) breadwallet &amp; bitcoin.com offer fees options like fast, economy etc. 
for me  I am waiting for atomic swaps (you can exchange a coin for any coin instantly and feeless) to come out so I can swap my coin for one that I can use a coin that has low fees

SPV wallet connect directly to blockchain while non SPV use their wallet server to connect to the blockchain

it not about the crash really it is more if i can actually use bitcoin or spend it without losing almost half of its value in the future
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:46:35
200$ fee is insane tho 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:34:20
So According to your example LN is like a Giftcard that works like a wallet so if i send bitcoin there i can only use it via LN correct ? and i just wanna make this clear will sending bitcoin to this wallet have low fees or not ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:45:07
Atomic swap ? swamping what, bitcoin to LN or other coins ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:56:21
i know atomic swaps i was asking if the bitcoin will be swaped to LN or what ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:23:10
will the fees from lets a say a normal wallet to LN wallet be cheap or what ?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:04:14
if send bitcoin to this segwit wallet how much will be the fee ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:18:25
Gdax is only supported in few countries
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:37:23
thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:34:03
you can click on that edit icon and pick economy fee the fee will be low (0.38) but it will take time until it is confirmed like every low fee transaction nowadays  
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:13:24
i know that but i want to move bitcoin where i can transact it cheap (i know still expensive but at least less than 3$) and can be LN supported 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:53:37
He can't because coinbase won't give access to BCC until January
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:43:58
Does it have custom fees?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:05:40
Segwit2x and LN shouldn't these fix that problem
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:00:54
I don't get it if segwit2x is implemented into the core then there will be no altcoin but all people here are saying it will create an altcoin how is that?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:39:02
And if it is not a significant amount?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:43:20
For Android other than myclieum?
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:55:00
I am just testing wallets just I wanna choose a good wallet for Android

Miners Are basically controlling this and as far a I can see there no way to penalize them for this shit
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:51:01
Didn't they sign the agreement? If they aren't going to implement how are they gonna fix the blocksize problem even before miner moved to BCH there were many unconfirmed transactions
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:51:46
When B2X is out the same amount of BTC you have will have the same on the other side / when B2X us out, BTC = 5  B2X = 5 get it?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:05:44
What would like to hear?
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:10:55
Is there any news that it will support segwit? And I don't want myclieum because it doesn't support custom fees yet
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:49:24
Well let's hope it works
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:57:05
Sweet l

i tired a mycelium seed with samourai and it worked
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:08:23

@_date: 2017-10-16 14:13:25
that the weakness is in the Wi-Fi standard itself so it affects macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux devices.

Cryptozombies is a DApp on ETH network that is like a tutorial on blockchain and smart contracts and they are forking soon to be their own DAppchain on loom network
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:38:41
Incase you wanna see them?!
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:54:29
What but how would they take 20$ out of the 0.1$ transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:05:59
Same people who use banks
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:18:38
Question how would they take the 20$ fee if they send 0.1$?
