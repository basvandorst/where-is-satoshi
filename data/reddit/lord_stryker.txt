Hi Dr. de Grey -  On behalf of the fellow mods over at we thought it was an excellent AMA.  You're welcome over there anytime.  If there's anything I / we can do to help promote your work, let me/us know.  Thanks again and I promise if I ever get super wealthy from bitcoin, SENS has a big donation heading their way as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:56:31
Nope.  Trying to co-opt Bitcoin by calling it Bitcoin cash and confusing untold number of people thinking they're getting one thing but actually another is reprehensible.
It shall always be called Bcash here.

So go back to the days where the fire dept would hold your burning house ransom until you paid them to put out the fire?  A series of private, for-profit police departments in your city?  So that if you get robbed you better hope the police company that showed up first is the one that you had a subscription for?  Pay for every mile you drive on a road, and the inefficiencies that entails?  Keep our country safe via set of mercenary companies?  A private corporation is going to do a more cost-effective and better job of keeping our food safe?  Or will they just do the absolute minimum to maximize their profits?  I categorically disagree with you and am disgusted you believe this.  I find your stance to be the ultimate immoral stance.  It is the ultimately selfish attitude of "I got mine, so fuck you.".  
Certain aspects of our society must be publicly funded in order for society to function.

Right but the transaction is always one way with groceries.  So I put $100 in it.  Once I buy $100 worth I have to close the channel and pay fees and open another with fees.  It's not worse.  It's just not any better.  I don't want to put in $1000 just to avoid fees
  That's locking up money that could be doing other things.

@_date: 2017-12-01 03:40:10
makes sense and no doesn't quite work that way.  Buying coins on coinbase puts your money in your coinbase account.  Its like those coins you bought are in Coinbase's wallet and they just owe you that amount.  That's why us here on r/bitcoin frown upon leaving a lot of bitcoins on coinbase.  You don't actually control those coins.  Whenever i buy bitcoin on coinbase I immediately then transfer them to my ledger address.  They're two completely separate bitcoin addresses.

Wrong.  Nodes decide if the blocks mined by the miners are accepted..  They are essential to the security of the Network.   I'm not going back and forth with you anymore. I support Bitcoin core.  You're free to support another crypto.

Thanks.  That seems to have done it.  At least for now.  No freezing.  It is taking much, much longer to sync though.  I was at 5 days left before I did what you suggested, I'm now at two weeks before I'm sync'd up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:29
Down to 8 days.  Yeah, I should have done it that way, but I formatted my usb drive as ext4 so I can't use my main PC to do that.  Should have made it FAT.  oh well.  I'll be fully synced soon enough I suppose.   Thanks for the help.

How does this actually solve the real-world use case of buying coffee?  That money only goes 1-way.  To the coffee shop.  So what happens when the payment channel is skewed all the way towards the merchant and there isn't any left in the channel for you to send anymore?  Close the payment channel and open another?  Well now you just incurred fees by touching the main blockchain.  I don't get how that actually works.  I get how it can make things fast and cheap but I don't see how it works in the real world.

They are.  Next update will enable segwit in the Core wallet.  Other teams are working on lightning network.  We're experiencing some growing pains , it'll pass.
It takes 3-4 days to do a traditional ACH bank transfer and can take weeks for a paper check sent globally.  Keep things in perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:34:38
"The fees will likely be $100 or more to withdraw your bitcoins..."  
You can't just throw that in there because most transactions wouldn't be on the main block-chain anymore so the fees won't be as high. That's the whole point.  Yes, fees are rising quickly right now without lightning.  But video is assuming fees will continue to rise just as fast as they are now.  Its also not IOUs.  They are still bitcoin that you "went in on" with another party via a smart contract.  Its still just bitcoin.  So many assumptions just put out there and blatantly biased views.  "Bitcoin has no value in the system and banks and gold, blah blah blah".  So no.  Don't agree with the video.

Yes, but its also effectively infinitely divisible.  With US dollars the smallest increment is 1 cent.  $0.01.  In bitcoin you can  have .0001 Bitcoins or .00000001 bitcoins.

Taxes are not theft and it is supremely moral.  We all live in a society. The moral action is to all pitch in and help each other.  What's immoral is the fleecing of our tax dollars by the banks for their own profit that doesn't go towards the greater good. 
I gladly pay taxes for police, teachers, roads, food safety, etc.  Do you want to hire your own personal food safety company to make sure you aren't eating poison?  Taxes are an absolute necessity for a functioning society.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:43
Supply and demand.  People are willing to spend more to get their transaction confirmed quickly.  If you aren't in a rush, a much smaller fee will still get confirmed.  Just might take a few hours, or a couple of days.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:07:28
Sounds great if you can control exactly who lives there by needing to buy-in and you are privileged enough to have enough money to pay for all of that.  Its a gated community on steroids.  Also helps that its just a town and not a country that also needs international representation for treaties, trade, defense.  I'd like to see how a little town gets all its food.  Is it all 100% grown, inspected, distributed within that community?  Are all its industrial pipes, asphalt for roads, medicine researched and produced within its borders?  Of course not.  Where does its coffee come from since you can't grow it in Norway?  Who pays for the importation of that coffee or any other item that has to be imported to ensure safety?  How about internet?  Oh, it has internet you say?  Then once again you're not in an isolated island of libertarian paradise but part of an international community.  How about when someone inevitably loses their job during the normal course of economic creation and death of companies?  Sorry, you got unlucky to have worked for a company that didn't make it.  Fuck you I guess for not saving enough to survive with no income.   Or what about if you're born with a disability or are a victim of a crime and can no longer perform your job anymore?  Guess its to the trash bin for you because I'm a libertarian and don't believe in any social welfare.  
I'm not going back and forth with you anymore.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:34:21

As long as the coffee shop pays its employees in bitcoin, sure.  We're a long ways off from that so I'm questioning how valuable lightning network will be until we get to that level of saturation.  We need scaling now, and it doesn't help if it only helps when the network is orders of magnitude larger than it currently is and we have scaling problems right now.

Once Bitcoin Core and coinbase implement segwit that should help (not solve) the mempool congestion and high fees, at least for a bit.

That's the question.  Yes, its been a problem which is why most of the miners are in China where the mining equipment is being built.   I think the next  generation of miners should be relatively stable.  We're hitting the wall of Moore's law pretty close.

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:42:09
A ledger Nano is exactly what I use to keep my bitcoin safe.  Yes, you can send your bitcoin to your ledger Nano address.  Then nobody can get your bitcoins unless they have both the physical device AND the pin on the device.  You can also keep a backup of your ledger wallet using the 12 word backup phrase in case it ever goes missing, gets stolen etc.  Make sure you keep those 12 words safe.
Basically yes to all of your questions.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:11:48
Take the long position
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:58:22
How would it work for paying for groceries for instance?  The payments are always one way.  Me to the grocery store.  Why open a payment channel (with fees) buy groceries for awhile then close the payment channel (fees again) just to do it all over again.  Im locking up my btc in a payment channel and I still don't get around fees.   I just don't see the real world use-case for it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:11:08


Same.  Or at least was partially Hal Finney if satoshi was actually multiple people.  Finney died around the same time satoshi dropped off the map.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:49:58
Yes.  That's also true.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:45:38
No. That means an enormous block chain and centralization of the nodes.  Its also a temporary solution.  Keep making the blocks bigger and it becomes cost prohibitive to run a node.  That threatens the entire network security.  
Use Bitcoin cash if you don't like Bitcoin.  Nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin. I choose to run core 15.1. those are the consensus rules I want to use.  You're free to do otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:18:25
Transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:53:46
Coinbase isn't a wallet. (Well, at least one you own).  Not your keys, not your bitcoin.  They have an IOU for bitcoin to you, but they control the keys, not you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:55:29
But the coffee shop will never send you money.  So effectively it is one way
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:07:28
Right, That's why I formatted it as ext4.  I'll give that a go.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:46:13
Got it working.  Thanks!  Syncing up now.  Full-node running 15.1
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:56:42
You 100% absolutely made the right decision.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:42:55
The answer is "lots of complicated math.".
The algorithm is built-in to only have 21 million coins.  Its inherent in how the entire blockchain is setup to function.  Now you *could* modify the algorithm to allow more than 21 million coins, but then its no longer the original bitcoin and you just created a fork (soft or hard) / alt-coin.  You can mine these new coins to your heart's content, but unless you get a whole bunch of other people to also mine your new algorithm and start using it as a commodity/currency, it won't really take off.  Unless of course you can convince 50%+ of bitcoin miners to convert to the new algorithm which allows for more than 21 million coins.  If that happens, then you could think of it as bitcoin 2.0 in a sense and it could potentially continue going.  
So its kinda/sorta possible but not something a single person can just go off and do on his/her own.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:02:20
That's my thought too.  $1700 for a 13.5 TH/s and a $70/month hosting fee is still netting you around $400/month.  Seems a little too good to be true.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:37:45
If you don't have a way to securely transfer your private keys to your next of kin, those bitcoins are lost forever.  Think of it has having a bunch of gold coins in an unbreakable safe that only you know the combination.  If you die and leave no way to pass on the combination, those gold coins stay locked away in safe until the end of time.
So yes, the entire nature of bitcoin is deflationary.  There can only be 21 million bitcoins and in the early days many, many keys were lost and will continue to be lost.  Time will tell how this will affect the long-term viability of a commodity / currency that is deflationary and decentralized.  Bitcoin is still an experiment.  One I think has great potential and a good chance of succeeding but certainly not something to convert your entire net worth into.
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:14:13
Yeah, it does.  Which as far as I can tell are total scams.
@_date: 2016-11-09 19:43:37
Yeah well...with a Trump administration the DOJ/DEA can and likely will raid and shut them all down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:10
We're a long ways off from businesses paying their employees with bitcoin.  Sure, you can find an isolated instance of that here or there but its not mainstream at all.  So your point was that lightning will work when the economy loops back and closes off. I agree with that.  We're a long way from that happening.  So right now, and in the next several months, a payment channel to a coffee shop effectively will be one way.  That doesn't help scaling because you'll be forced to open/close payment channels once one side has all the bitcoin from that payment channel.  That means on-chain transactions and does not help alleviate the mempool. There isn't any flowing back and I don't see that happening anytime soon.  When walmart, boeing, Amazon start accepting and paying their employees directly with bitcoin, then I'm with you but that *is* a long ways off.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:50:57
You can send bitcoins from a non-segwit address to a segwit address. Otherwise, how could it have initially worked?  Nobody would have had a segwit address initially.  Coinbase though still has non-segwit addresses so all bitcoins that go to coinbase aren't using segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:45:22
Oh really?  My student loans in fact are a bit less than that.  Where can I look more into "long term holding?".  I admit I wasn't expecting the rise so fast so I haven't been preparing the tax implications as well as I should have been.

He has done no such thing.  He has never sent a message signed with Satoshi's private key.  He does that and that proves it, nothing else does.
