so that was the main point of this post from the very beginning, everyone here knows that they can only regulate the usage.
@_date: 2014-04-30 12:28:04

Is it possible, that this work made by Banksy?? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:18:21
It's just an option. It might happened or might not, only time can show us something. So lets wait for an awesome future.
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:09:59
Hope they are not fatassholes.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:03:52
I'm in love with this painting, completely!
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:29:36
seems legit, but right now government regulates everything.
But in my opinion they'll get nothing in their tries to regulate BTC.

@_date: 2014-05-14 15:59:34

@_date: 2014-03-27 13:53:04
I think that this coin is a great charrity opportunity, so I know that there are lots of new coins appear every week or smth., but this one is good.
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:42:51
But there are (in that article) also some suggestions about how to mine altcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:02:00
hope so.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:29:19
why do you think so?
I find this graffities pretty similar with what Benksy does.
But, on the other hand this paintings located in San Francisco, so there is the question - what is he doing there?
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:20:16

@_date: 2014-05-28 15:31:53
you need to create a full map of places you were visiting. That would be a truly insane start up project "Donate for future acceptance"
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:03:32
They'll face lots of misunderunderstanding, but I hope this will go well.
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:27:33
and that's why mass media exists)
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:12:10
