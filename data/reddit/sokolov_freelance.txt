I am sure that this process can be enjoyed if you are a big fan of cryptocurrency. :)

OMG, are you serious? Be above it, crypto-currencies do not get involved in politics. Globalization and all that. ��

Yes, with the help of monero you can wash bitcoins. But you need to bother with different transaction times, many wallets, so that the amounts were different and came from different addresses.

You do realize we're told the same thing about you, right? You have to be able to separate people from politics.

Yeah, right, I mean a lot of different addresses.

When it comes to anonymous payments, I'm a big supporter of Monero. But as practice shows, many people use bitcoin because of ignorance or for the convenience of their buyers/partners and in such cases I recommend using mixers.

What makes you think that?
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:20:11
Let's stop talking about this.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:43:51
We already have users from Europe. As for Russia, there are very strong programmers here, and I think this is an advantage. 
Anyway, thanks for the advice. ����
