So as of right now I can't just go program a smart contract and add it to the chain?

Alts have so much more potential to rise than bitcoin. This article is advocating getting in early on good tech. Check out ether that's where the real blockchain tech is being developed.

It's actually enough to keep you out of poverty for life.

Having 100% of your net worth in bitcoin sounds ridiculous. The scaling issues might not work themselves out and this whole thing dies. 2 months from now and you're wishing you cashed out at least enough to get you through college or an initial business. Cash out at least some and make sure you pay your tax bill. Invest in something in the real world (check out boglehead lazy portfolio or invest in your college education or whatever). You have money and it's your life.
If you want a girlfriend it's about making yourself interesting. How can you use that money to become interesting? Maybe 1 year of travel while blogging/youtubing. Volunteer for different things along the way. Learn to dance. You can pay for all that stuff and it will make you interesting. Then it's just opening up to women and getting over your fear of rejection.

I agree that you can retire off of 300k especially if you make sure you build passive outcome. I disagree that spending on a bunch of places in a country you've never even lived in and trying to rent is a good way to go about it initially (without extensive research and at least living there for 6 months).
