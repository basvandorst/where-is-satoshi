Ok everyone...My name is Payu Harris allow me to answer a few things...we chose a alt coin to create for a few reasons...one is because as this is planned to become the tribes national Currency it's important we have a role in it's development. we WILL be also implementing Bitcoin as well as litecoin on the reservation as well...for us to use BTC as a fully national currency for the tribe it would require a lead position of BTC holdings...otherwise we're just using someone elses currency. ok as far as "pre-mining"  we have no interest in pre mining Mazacoin to death. however we also are concerned about major professional mining teams basically strip mining the difficulty of the coin through the ceiling. We ARE working to draft tribal regulations that allow almost unrestricted growth and development of crypto currencies while still protecting consumer confidence in the market. A certain level of KYC/AML standards are needed in order to protect consumers, however they should not be so complex and restrictive that they hinder growth and development. I would invite everyone to view our project pages  and  and email me @ kimitsugroup   I would love to hear your thoughts, comments, opinions and advice on this exciting project for 2014

ok if you read the  page there are 1.6 Billion coins that will be produced...the "Pre mine" phase is meant to insure that there are enough coins available in reserve so that our tribe can actually use them on a daily basis... I know of 3 major Mining Clusters...a 4 Phs  a 7 Phs and a 9 Phs (Launched in april) that could drive the Diff for MZC through the room in a matter of days (51% anyone?). Now people on the Reservation will not be able to afford $5,000 + mining rigs, so the limited pre mine is meant to establish enough MZC so it can be traded on open exchanges...but also used around indian country on a daily basis...this is NOT an "pre mine the hell out of it and cashout" plan, MZC is designed to be a workable, usable, every day coin...not a horde and dump like people are doing with FTC, NVC, NMC and DGC, etc...also MZC is the FIRST crypto thats  specificly designed to be for a free and sovereign tribal nation state...but I do hear the concerns and I appreciate the input and comments...  -Payu-
