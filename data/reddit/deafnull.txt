You could try Ubuntu, good support community. Install Ubuntu Server and then run Ubuntu desktop on that. Pretty straightforward to install. Just Google around a bit.

My apologies for maybe a moronic question, but the people buying/selling at MtGox are people that have their coins there? I mean, why would you sell large amounts of BTC at MtGox (if you don't have your money in it), are they hoping it will be 'business as usual' again and then buy cheap coins back?

True. It's like any (stock) investment, but with crypto even a higher risk. I put in an amount of money which I did not need and which I calculated as lost. Any profit is just fun and extra. 
Some people take loans out to invest in stock or cryptos, crazy f4cking greed.

Ok, but my point is, lots of well respected people in the industry have said things years ago that seem crazy now years later. But some are understandable too. Nobody is 100% sure what will happen to Bitcoin. I check Coinmap and adoption rate, not what Buffy has to say.

Could this mean that, once they are in business, the volume per order will increase? I mean, speed is their biggest advantage.

What if you die, no one will ever know the code. Maybe relatives could inheret else. But hell, yes, truly secure to memorize it, no doubt.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:28:16
lol. What a master troll.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:15:27
People are getting scammed for over 1000 years in thousands of ways, btc won't change shit about that. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:32:11
I think this is what the crypto community needs, make the payments easier for non geeks. To tell you the truth, this whole 'tipping' business is going to be the future and will go sky high in less than 3 yrs from now. Good blog writers get paid by tipping. Wanna read an article? Ok, here's a few coins. Liked this article? Here's a few coins etc. You liked my comment? Let me throw some coins your way. Some people laugh about the Dogers that tip the shit out of each other, but in a couple of years we'll read large newspapers and pay in cryptos.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:44:57
Think about your friends and family you selfish bastard.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:15:25
Nice. Get the server edition and then install ubuntu-desktop and gnome-panel. Gives you less junk than the desktop one and works like a charm :)
Edit: and LVM full disk encryption.

So this is actually good news.

No regulation = self controlled cold wallet. Simple as that. If I make trades I get my coins out of that exchange asap, no matter how their 'reputation' is.
People tend to forget that in most cases it are inside jobs. Nothing worse than a pissed off co-worker.

Do mailheaders match up with smtp.com? Does Google do a reverse lookup on that to resolve?

1000 shitty headlines and one saying 'Google is going to implement BTC' in The NYT and BTC will be off the charts.
Btw, some bum in Macon (GE) is now accepting Bitcoins!

Sure, just do it. What do you have to lose ;-)

During every spike more people invest, so yes, an upgoing trend.

Why would you use a server and expect high I/O load if you are just going to store wallets.
