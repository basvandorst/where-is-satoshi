To offer a counter example, one problem with using a trading rule like this is if the price is going up over a long period of time, it might never or rarely execute a buy.
On the other hand, if the rule only excludes buying at the top ends of the average, then it's not very different from regular DCA.

If you're using a "fully forgetting" version of tails it would need to be done with each boot.  Agreed it would be much better if it was built in.
The nice thing is that the newer electrum versions seem to work, it just needs to get bundled.  
If I'm understanding the process right, it needs to be bumped up in Debian from TESTING to STABLE.  Then we probably need a new Tails release after that.
Or someone could build a custom tails distro with the newer Electrum version.  But I wouldn't trust a custom distro (specific for bitcoin users) that they didn't put something malicious in it to steal private keys.

Lightning network provides to option to do several transactions offchain before it goes to the Bitcoin blockchain.  This reduces the number of transactions that need to go to the blockchain.  With fewer transactions going in each block, the competition for increasingly higher fees diminishes.  Likewise it drives competition in the lightning network nodes for lower fees.
A good comparison is a bar tab.  If you bought a beer each time with a credit card, the merchant actually has to pay something like $2.50 in fees to the credit card company every time the card gets swiped.  So instead open up a bar tab, and only send one transaction to the credit card company at the end of the night.

I would recommend not doing this unless necessary, at least until the mempool backlog is cleared.  The reason I say that is because:
 * it still results in a high fee transaction which worsens the high fee problem
 * coinbase pays the fee.  But if this gets abused, they will add a fee

You have a "watching only" version of electrum (without private keys) on an online computer.  You can generate the transaction there.  
The offline electrum only needs to sign the transaction.
Then the online computer can transmit your transaction.
You need USB drive to transfer the transaction file between computers.  There is a youtube video demonstrating.

@_date: 2017-12-02 18:07:24
As far as law and order goes...
Bitcoin actually (for good or ill) makes it harder to do illegal things.  The reason is that the ledger is public.
Whereas with cash, it's extremely difficult to track, but with Bitcoin you can see exactly who received Bitcoin, how how much, when, and from whom.  Only the address is visible, but Governments with data gathering efforts have the ability to de-anonymize through information gathering.  Or even targetting specific areas like giving a subpeona to an exchange find out who owns a certain account and figuring out their network of associates.
It's actually much better than cash in terms of preventing money laundering for that reason.  It also makes it easier to track and  take down networks of criminals because every transaction is recorded forever; every input and output is known.  Governments have acknowledged the money laundering potential of Bitcoin is very low.  And there have already been cases of the use of the bitcoin ledger to prosecute people.
If you trade on a regulated exchange that requires identification, it's unlikely that other users of the exchange are laundering.  If they are, it becomes much easier to catch them.  
Even with digital USD (numbers in bank accounts), the largest money laundering operation in the world occurred with HSBC, a respectable bank. 
Do your part to fight crime and use Bitcoin instead of fiat!

I just did the hallway test.  I pulled someone out of the hallway to give their input on the old vs new sites without giving any detail on which one was which.  The person happened to be a bitcoin newbie.  The results were:
Likes the old site better because:
 * there is a video right up front, something to watch and understand what bitcoin is
 * page design feels easier on the old site.  On the new site thinks, "do I need to be an expert to use this?"
So I think the suggested would be: add a video up front, and make the front page look simpler.

From what I can see from reading, I bet this security and convenience is relative to keepass with yubikey one-time password addon and synced over dropbox.  It may even have some advantages over that.  
1) the key never leaves the device
2) entire database is not decrypted, each time you open a site, that site credentials are decrypted individually (you need to confirm on the device)
3) easy key recovery if the device gets lost
4) many users already trusting bitcoin keys with similar security protection
The chrome/dropbox/drive requirement seems a little unfortunate.  But presumably Trezor users are already using Chrome, and some of those already using a cloud service store labels, so it may not add additional requirements.  NextCloud might be a nice option to add for storage.
The integration to Chrome may actually add some benefit, like automatic site opening, and possibly ensuring the addon is up to date for security purposes.  And by being able to control almost the entire pipeline (hardware, hw/sw bridge, chrome addon, credential entry into the site), there's more control over security.  
So overall, it seems to be a pretty easy way to get very high security on passwords for existing Trezor users.

WRITE DOWN ENTIRE SEED
@_date: 2019-08-21 22:09:17
I think this is a really good question and exercise to do.  But instead of answering it, I'm going to give you other information.
It's important to note that you posted enough of your private key for someone to brute force and steal all the coins from that wallet with possibly weeks or days of processing.  You should consider this wallet burned, and not use it.
The best practice for keeping your coins save is to keep them on a hardware wallet.  If you don't have a hardware wallet, I've heard that mobile wallets are relatively secure, but probably only suitable for medium-small amounts.
Generally speaking, wallets where they keys/seed is stored on a computer are less secure and only suitable for small amounts.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:11:18
It's possible you can run a program yourself that does this.  There are a few open source programs that could be used, or you could write one yourself.  Generally that would be something that would be run on a dedicated linux computer or raspberry pi.  
Security note 1...  the automated DCA programs require an API key which is something that needs to be protected.  If, for example, it was run on a machine that had some malicious software installed, someone could likely steal what the owner has on the exchange, or other nasty things. 
Security note 2... only run a DCA program you trust, or there is a risk the author could steal your API key.
Here is such a program I wrote.  It does require some comfortability administering linux.  But it is simple enough the code can be quickly reviewed to verify the program is doing what the readme says.
There are other such programs as well that can be found on github.  You may also be able to find something similar, like a tradebot, and configure it to do buys only.

- Goal 90%, actual 85%
- Transaction count: 58% for all transactions, 85% excluding bills and subscriptions.  
- Transaction value: 35% of transaction value, 83% excluding bills and subscriptions. 
- I did not intend to include bills but I am tracking them anyway.
- I'm including bitcoin debit card as "crypto".
- 0 lightning transactions, 0 cash transactions, and 0 crypto-but-not-bitcoin purchases in January.
- I'm looking for more places to upgrade to bitcoin or bitcoin lightning where possible, so feel free to give suggestions.
Things I learned
- I found that by intentionally not using credit cards, I stick to a budget much better.
- It's difficult to pay bills with bitcoin.
- It's very difficult/costly to pay rent in bitcoin. I could have done it with bitcoin debit card, but there would have been a "debit card charge" of over $35.
- When using bitcoin debit card at gas stations I pre-pay to simplify taxes, otherwise the gas station puts a large hold on the card then refunds the remainder.
- I'm not paying any fees currently for purchasing bitcoin.
Also: don't forget taxes from spending cryptocurrency, there are services that can help by importing transactions and calculating things mostly automatically.

 *   also save copy of passphrase in multiple places
 *   test restoring it with a small amount before moving everything over, write down instructions

With open source software the source code also must be available, which means that anyone else could make an identical product at no cost.  It also means you and anyone else can audit the code and verify it's not malicious.
Open source has a big advantage over closed source wallets because you should not trust mysterious, un-auditable software not to steal your coins, because you have no way of verifying it.
So either they do it for the benefit of Bitcoin, or they find another way to make money off of it.

If you assume a big price increase over time, then any time is good.
The problem with trying to time buying is that the price is impossible to predict with accuracy. If you put in a little bit regularly over time (like once per week), I've heard that's a decent way to mitigate the risk of price fluctuations.

I would buy one ASIC to supplement home heating.  Then use the rest to buy Bitcoin regularly over the course of 6 months.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:13:53
There are a good amount of people with old ASICs willing to give them away or sell very cheap.  I remember someone made a comment recently about having a bunch of unused KnC Jupiters for example. I think miners with a large number of machines stop mining on the old ones when the hash-to-watts ratio gets lower than the new machines, so they swap them out to get a better profit margin.  However, those old ASICs can still hash. 
Just be aware an ASIC sucks power, generates heat, and is about as noisy as a space heater.  However, if you were going to use heat anyway, you can run an ASIC, get the same heat, but you can help secure bitcoin, and keep the mining decentralized.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:38:54
Just for example
*   running a 3 year old ASIC getting 1000 GH/s at 1000 Watts (1kW), with low or no cost to acquire
*   power cost $0.11 USD per kWh (but in actuality varies by location)
*   electricity cost to run 24 hours a day would be $2.64/day  (1kW x 24 hours x $.011)
*   if this replaced an electric heater, actual cost would be near $0 during cold seasons.  If it replaced a cheaper heat source cost would be somewhere between $0.00 and $2.64.
*   Mining reward approximately 20,000 satoshi per day.  Reward will vary, and likely decrease over time as mining power increases.  But on the other hand, the value of a satoshi varies greatly over time, too, usually upward.
*   Support Bitcoin (priceless)
Values may be off because of different factors, but it's just a more realistic example of Bitcoin heating.
Here is a good comparison of ASICs, energy usage, and estimated hash rate.
KnC Jupiter for example gets 500GH/s for 600 Watts

Previously the pool with the highest market share was antpool at ~40%.  Now it's slush at 20.8%.  That sounds a lot more decentralized to me--not having one pool control almost half the hashing power.

I believe mining will always reach an equilibrium over time.  If it is more profitable, then more people would start mining, increase the competition, and drive the profit margin down.  If it was less profitable, miners would drop out or become more efficient until it was no longer unprofitable.  If everyone becomes more efficient and profitable, then the difficulty raises and puts it back to equilibrium.
Your example with the mining rewards ending also means that the supply will be less.  Economics says that the same demand and lower supply means higher prices.  Higher prices would result in miner fees being more meaningful.  So again I believe it would reach equilibrium again one way or another.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:38:34
I haven't studied it extensively, but I've been watching the bandwidth of my node and it's been using upload bandwidth moreso than download bandwidth (except for initial blockchain download).
Often one's internet bandwidth is divided by upload and download capabilities.  According to a quick search, it only requires 5mbps download to stream even in HD.  So while it's possible it could consume a lot of your download speed during the initial sync, and could possibly affect streaming during that time, I would say it's less likely to affect streaming too much in normal operation.
Situations could differ, though.  If you notice it causing degradation, you could always throttle it.

I have looked for alternative online vendors that accept bitcoin in each case.  I strongly favored the vendors that accepted bitcoin.  Of the ones where I did not use bitcoin:
- 2x, better price/convenience
- 1x, it was a specialty item available only at that store
- 1x, medical debt w/ specific payment method for tax purposes
I also made an attempt to use bitcoin lightning where possible.  Generally I found a low number of vendors accepting it, but I am adding to a list of "favorite vendors" and will continue making attempts to use bitcoin or lightning more often.
Thus far I have not suggested any of them accept bitcoin, however, I like the idea of suggesting it as an option.  If a store gets enough requests, they are more likely to consider adding it.

It seems more likely his phone was already infected, and it only transmitted the transaction once it saw it was connected to a network.
I'm not aware of a vulnerability where simply connecting to a public network would risk a wallet, unless it's really bad wallet software.   Because even if someone intercepted the transaction (which is possible), they couldn't change it without having access to the private key to re-sign?  It's possible the phone was compromised by accessing the wifi in some way, which would be possible, but also seems very unlikely. 
The real danger was keeping that much in a hot wallet, like other comments have said.

The point I'm trying to make is that you can't do fraud in the same way with Bitcoin.  The problem with credit cards is that if someone sees your transaction or hacks the merchant, the transaction itself gives access to your entire account.  Debit cards are even worse.
Whereas with Bitcoin, having your transaction exposed results in no risk at all.

There are certain tools that help with bitcoin taxes.  For example bitcoin.tax, but there are others.  I think you can actually enter a transaction for 2019 year for free and you can see what it will look like and how it will work.  hint: cost basis

I wonder if it could be a problem with no route of channels from source to destination.
I would check if phone A shows channels green/normal. 
And also check if there is a channel TO the destination.  I think channels are one-way only, so someone needs to open a channel to the destination (with sufficient funds).
This may or may not be the problem.

That's a good idea.  I think a service like that is possible but does not exist yet. I know of a "automatically buy $X in bitcoin every week" service, but not a "buy $X of bitcoin sometime around the same time I make a purchase of value $X".

I take your point.  Savings increases demand, which increases price.  Bitcoins are more valuable and merchants want to accept Bitcoin to get access to that value.  But I also think the other is true-- if there is some spending, it shows it has value as a means of exchange, which increases merchant adoption, and demand to have it for ability to use as well.
It depends on the individual situation, but I don't have much downside to spending if it's being replenished in some way (getting paid in Bitcoin or re-buying).
If everyone did all their transactions at the base layer, it would probably cause some short-term scaling issues.  That is why I am challenging myself to try to use lightning where possible.  Ironically, Bitcoin debit card has less impact to the mempool than base layer transactions.

It's also possible you sent money to someone else, who subsequently did something that triggered their algorithm.
Unfortunately, you don't have any control over what other people do once you send them Bitcoin. 
"For security reasons" means that their third party chain analysis vendor doesn't want to explain their algorithms because even they don't understand them.

My understanding is the amount owed is the same whether a document is sent or not, and the taxpayer is responsible for making sure they are paying the correct amount.  However, the document is useful for verifying the calculations are correct, for both the recipient and the IRS.
There are some web sites that help with calculating Bitcoin taxes, as well as other cryptocurrencies.  The web sites are usable for the average Bitcoiner.  An example of the final output of one of these web sites might be a standard tax document with sales and gains organized in FIFO-style, which can be easily used by an individual or tax professional when preparing taxes.

According to this link, 8 peers might indicate a problem with your router not forwarding that port to your computer.  
Assuming your network setup is a router plus one or more computers connected to the router... If someone tries to connect to your network, the router blocks that port because the router itself does not have that port open.  
If you configure something (like port forwarding or possibly UPnP) on the router, then it knows what computer and port to forward it to (e.g. your IP address of your computer on your LAN and port 8333).  It may help to make sure your computer is on a static IP on your local network, so you don't have to change router settings each time you reboot.
If you're saying it's sometimes reachable and sometimes not, I wouldn't be able to explain that.

I personally wouldn't trust a cell phone with more than 0.05BTC, purely because they contain a built-in transmitter which you cannot deactivate, and chip that can give the cellphone company complete control over your phone (or whoever else finds the backdoor).
I hotwallet on a computer I would trust with the same amount, depending upon OS and other factors.

They sent out a vote to stock holders.  The measure would allow Grayscale to define which chain is bitcoin.  I do not know the outcome of the vote, but the default vote was to give them that power.  Related thread

You could send a payment of 1 satoshi. That way when they send a transaction you can associate the other inputs as being part of a single wallet.  If any of the inputs are identifiable, you will know who it is.  
As a 2nd level you could send 1 satoshi each to each of the outputs for that transaction, and so forth.
On the down-side, they would know how much BTC you have in the sending address(es).  Another possibility to consider is that if the scammer sent your 1 satoshi to a gambling site, your exchange might ban you for being only 2 hops from a gambling site, as stupid as that is.

Is 1 node sufficient to run the network? No?  Then how many nodes are enough?  At what point does adding more nodes NOT contribute to the security of the network.  
Answer: every node counts.

This is interesting.  There is a fact in question, which is whether [bitcoin.org]( belongs to the community or to a trusted individual.
I believe both Adam and Cobra want to do what is best for bitcoin.  So I feel like it comes down to opinion on the best approach.  Even people working on the same team can disagree on the best approach, but the benefit to having the discussion is that you can get a better understanding of the options available.
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:58:46
This is true to a point. But here's where it's not true:
1. No one wants to actually run S2X nodes.
2. The intentionally nasty network split will result in sybil attack symptoms **depending on the number of each type of node** as the nodes start to ban each other (see banscore).  However, it goes both ways.  A large number of Bitcoin nodes vs S2X nodes will result in negative effects for S2X as well.
Here is a good description of the effects.  But there is a lot of potential to exploit network isolation in particular as the split is happening and immediately after.

I have purchased many many Amazon gift cards from bitrefill and they always work.
Note that bitrefill gets their gift cards direct from official amazon/supplier and does not re-sell used gift cards or anything like that.
Also note the message on the bitrefill page that they are for personal use only (not meant for re-sale).

One reason computers are less secure than hardware wallets is that the computer has thousands of programs running on it which are impossible to vet. The operating system itself could do something itself (especially if not running linux). If the programs don't have anything malicious, there could be security issues with any of the above.
With a hardware wallet the keys always stay on the device.  You only have to trust an extremely limited set of firmware and hardware instead of a huge stack of operating systems and programs, any of which could potentially be leveraged to steal your keys.
Having the computer airgapped is an improvement, but you still would need to connect something to it in order to spend, which is a risk.  Airgap hacks are also possible.  There's still a risk of malicious software. Unless you're destroying the computer after use, you still have an additional risk of key remnants getting revealed by whoever plugs it in.  And you might want to update the software and OS periodically to keep it up to date for security patches.  Bitcoin core is harder to back up than hardware wallets as well.
What you could do is:
Satellite &gt; full node &gt; electrumX or EPS &gt; electrum &gt; hardware wallet
That would provide the same level of security, ability to validate your own transactions without going to any websites or querying any services, plus the benefit of having an independent source of block data (satellite). Can be run without the satellite dish as well, but without the benefits to you and the network of having it.
