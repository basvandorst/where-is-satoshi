They say it fixes it but with the amount of transactions they're dealing with Yeah ok. 
Btc cash will have the same problem as btc if it has the same trading volume. If increasing block size fixed the problem why isn't btc cash no.1?

If the problem of fast transactions and low fees is solved. Sorry I don't understand maybe you can help me understand. Why isn't btc cash rising and taking over btc in the market btc is trash atm. But btc cash solving the problems it has should show signs over overtaking btc. 
Edit: wording

This wouldn't happen if the people investing knew and believed in bitcoin. You wouldn't be listening to these people. You'd be buying when it's low. Learn and apply it instead of following the words of such people make your own decisions. I personally believe in btc so I'm waiting for the next buy opportunity

The technology is there and will be implemented. At the moment they are dealing with these problems just remember although it's been how long bitcoin is still in its infant stage. Bitcoin will be attacked and this will allow the system to do upgrades produce counter measures become stronger and repeat when the day comes and it's ready for mass adoption you can't stop bitcoin

From my understanding block size won't change and won't fix the problem. That's why block size will stay the same and they will implement  LN

Wowee. Is it just me. When I'm day trading I'm trading all sorts of reliable coins but always come back and hold bitcoin in the long run.

As someone that joined in around September with my brother. Needing to spank a baby new. In it for the ride and preaching the future of money is here. Educate yourselves we missed taking out our funds when everything was booming in December our trading was going off the charts then boom it crashed we didn't know what happened. Did research looked into pass years saw there's was pattern and that's the time people take out profits every year. History repeats but the differences is new highs and higher lows. HODL and educate yourself follow the block chain not the money. Don't believe the FUD see what's happening with bitcoin we have a lot of things happening and because of that the price of fees is getting reduced. I don't worry about prices anymore I just follow with what their doing to make things better to make bitcoin better and that will push the price up.

If that's the case then you'd have slow txns for the first few before being routed more if a reason to always be connected and have at least one open?

A bit of confusion hoping more would input to get a better abswer.

I understand that but before any channels are open the txn time will still be that of the current speed on-chain does this mean if you wanted to have fast txn speeds you have to always keep one channel open and what are the cons to keeping it open?
