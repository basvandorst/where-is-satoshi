I smell fake news. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:16:40
Going to Vegas tomorrow mind me asking where exactly this was in Vegas? Wouldn't mind using it for shits and giggles to get some cash out 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:51:55
No problem leaving Vegas now. Found a bitaccess atm at the D and they had online instructions I tried to follow but since it wasnt clear on what leaving enough in your wallet to cover miner fees I passed on attempting a withdraw since I wasn't exactly sure how that made sense considering once I send the amount requested to them how the fee would be covered. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:43:53
Guys if you cant already see the writing is on the wall. The US is cleaning house on all of this so they can be the ones profiting from the cryptocurrency market they are clearing the path Bitmex is probably next.
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:33:49
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:34:02
You are right I should have said most not all but still lets be serious 
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:47:46
The writings on the wall. If smart money (whales) knew alts would recover even anything close to ATH they would never had got this low. Time to cleanse and weed out the scams
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:38:38
Should have hit it already so who knows when if ever now. Long drawn out 
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:25:46
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:14:32
No I've been watching too much CNBC 
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:04:20
Every news article posted in these crypto sub reddits is manipulation that's a poor excuse for a ban and my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:27:22
SEC will never approve ETFs because of this. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:33:50
Yep looks like the bots are active down voting this too, expecting a ban any minute. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:00:41
You're IQ will be permanently damaged by watching or reading anything covered by CNBC
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:36:58
Can I have some of what you are on 
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:35:13
Except cash works way better right now 
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:36:47
It was just a reply to someone asking if they should buy alts now
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:59:21
Just do it anyway as long as you are not stealing money from them to do it who cares I mean really. It's your money you are young. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:29:10
Nice video thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:34:07
This is a terrible article. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:45:26
You could have got $1200 for each BCH token if you did it on bittrex several hours ago 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:08:42
Because I've never seen a downturn like the huge crash in January I figured it would bounce once the initial -30% hit fast. I experienced the mini crashes during the China FUD around aug/Sept last year I had no idea this was going to be totally different. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:52:56
We ded jim
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:49:48
Mostly shitcoins at the time the crash started and I waited too long before going back to BTC when I should have went immediately. I was thinking with the bounce the huge dips on the shitcoins bounces back too. But we kept going down after the bounce suddenly it felt like it was too late might as well hold at this point and that cycle played over and over. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:14:38
Who's going to start moving it up in the first place though to induce another run of FOMO and convince the sideline money to join? Right now everyone is scared because they know bitcoin just came from 20k and no one wants to buy those bags that's going to rinse and repeat.
If there was so much money on the sidelines they should already be in at these prices. In my opinion the only thing that moves it up is if institutional money is dumb enough to actually come into the market and get dumped on since the majority of bitcoin is already owned by top wallets. It's that or real world acceptance and real adoption. So far I have seen almost no progress for bitcoin in the year since I have been in the market lightning seems to be a joke. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:04:30
This is a really dumb question. Maybe if you said 5k was all you have would you put it in bitcoin would be a much better question. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:29:50
I think about it every day unfortunately knowing I could have cashed out 350k or at least half of it and never did. This was life changing money for me as I didn't have much to begin with. It hurts bad 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:14:41
That would be bitmex saving their asses on paying out massive shorts I fully expect this to continue within a few days/weeks
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:09:40
You can actually when the people that do the manipulating are usually the ones with the buy volume that actually moves it. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:50:57
Are you asking what came first the chicken or the egg? Because certainly the masses fomoed into the market and certainly was a huge reason for the price run up tether or not. Mom's dad's and family asked about this bitcoin thing. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:43:28
How? Simple holding shitcoins through the crash instead of moving it back to BTC. No trading involved in the loss just holding. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:11:06
Dad's thinking it will be worth closer to $0 in a few years atm. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:14:19
Not many are selling now but many are losing to the whales playing these games like today. Everytime they do this and people go play in alts they are sucking money from these people because the drop will resume soon. It's basically milking the market while no fresh money is coming in. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:11:05
Whichever way makes bitmex more profit. More $ on shorts or longs 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:13:23
eBay you will need to accept something thing other than crypto obviously. Crypto doesn't work for peer to peer transactions because someone would have to trust the other person so unless you meet up for a local sale. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:56:20
You are not alone I went from 22 btc to 5 btc but it's mostly because when the market crashed I didn't sell out of all my alts to bitcoin. It is critical to move to BTC the instant a crash begins. Cant lose btc when you are in it. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:06:29
Actually I remember reading your original post now that I see you really did post it 6 months ago. Kudos to you what's your next move to make money? Think we get any decent bounces on bitcoin in the 2k-4k range? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:16:41
Unfortunately it's just manipulation not real fresh cold hard cash that believes in the future of bitcoin that's causing it. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:43:10
He doesn't brag about it i have only heard about him regret it and apologize for it 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:57:51
Hopium is one hell of a drug it truly is 
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:11:31
Yeah but eventually it has to go back up they can't keep making money shorting it. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:40:54
Other way around unfortunately 
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:50:44
Not really instead of looking for solutions to problems we just keep allowing bitcoin to be forked 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:37:19
Yes those things could induce another fomo run and the only reason I'm still hanging around but they have all yet to happen yet and I'm not convinced institutional money is going to enter and be dumped on potentially since the majority of bitcoin is already held by top wallets. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:17:11
Pretty ignorant to just judge someone by their past. People do change and you are just turning a blind eye and ignoring everything he said and don't even care to make any arguments against what he is saying. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:13:23
This is bound to happen anyway shitcoins are heading towards 0
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:12:53
People will bury their heads and the sand and down vote you rather then discuss another big problem with this community. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:01:19
It might not go too far either way if bitmex is controlling the price at this point they probably have the money to unless big money comes in on either side to change that. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:56:25
No it will go lower after every bounce though and then get super cheap and we can do it all over again. Rejoice 
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:49:09
Nah I don't play futures or margin but that does appear to be what the manipulation is currently revolved around. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:18:14
If only I caught every bottom before they bounce it. Most people will lose money trying to trade this. Wait for a clear bottom and reversal because of big news like ETFs would be the safest thing. Or just buy now and hold. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:04:40
As if that volume was anything else but big money with an agenda making a move. Cough cough short squeeze and futures
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:09:24
I never said that it wasn't but there's no denying there is going to be heavy manipulation in a unregulated market. Of course the huge run up was going to end in a crash and buying bitcoin is a hard sell right now but as long as these markets still exist and people can get money into it it will go back up. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:48:08
No problem I understand how it could come off as ignorant and childish but I am not a clueless crypto newb that just got into the market. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:04:06
Did they manipulate all the reddit subs to grow by 9000% too? 
@_date: 2018-06-28 15:12:58
They need a way to hide money from their husband's. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:06:39
I'm crying hahaha my favorite guy at the end and the McDonald's meme did me in hahahaha 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:20:35
Yeah one that I'll probably never get a chance to correct. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:42:07
Most of bitcoins supply is already owned by a small % of the top wallets buzz 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:28:36
When ETF?
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:25:05
Hi it's me your ex girlfriend we have 2 kids I never told you about 
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:28:20
We really need 4k soon
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:01:20
When moon sir? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:00:42
This entire thing is just another story to get the prices down before institutional money buys in they want it cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:51:55
Oh really so you think bitcoin isn't going to ever head back up towards 10k again? Please do give us your input 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:52:21
Lmao toooooshay
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:15:48
Looks like someone bought btc above 10k and wishes he shorted all the way down from 20k. Cool story bro 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:31:07
Are you still fked up on drugs from the party? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:17:59
Bingo still money to be made my friend 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:59:47
Not too many looks about even time for more sideways 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:08:43
I made all my unrealized gains in alts not Bitcoin. Mostly antshares at $5 and Kucoin at $2 before it shot to $15. You are probably right too much info 
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:29:26
He would say when moon again I wanna be the richest man in the world 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:25:56
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:31:49
No I perfectly understand it's a bubble that popped several times and as long as heavy regulation doesn't stop money coming into the market it will keep playing out cycles. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:46:09
I would i think it's headed back to at least 9k for now 
@_date: 2018-06-17 13:35:06
It's missing "and to the moon again" 
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:25:02
This was retail FOMO the world knows about it now. I'm just not convinced institutional money will come into something that the majority is already owned by top wallets. Retail isn't going to push this market back up unless the world adopts it as an actual currency which seems unlikely given all of its problems. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:15:41
Clearly a paid campaign with bots I wonder who's behind it and if they are aware of something most people aren't. Like big money about to enter the market 
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:06:29
^^ this and that's unlikely to happen without big news like ETFs 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:21:08
Exactly and no one seems to be able to argue against this very valid point I keep bringing up
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:42:12
And if it goes back to 10k will you be shocked? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:02:22
Reddit convinced me not to buy TRX XRP and XVG in early mid 2017 had I not listened I would be a multi millionaire. I feel scammed that I didn't fall for the scams. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:10:56
Crypto in general has basically lost all of its hype, not sure how and if it picks up any momentum the other way since everyone is actually aware of bitcoin and cryptocurrency now. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 01:53:32
You are talking about a once in a lifetime thing with the growth of bitcoin it will never see the 1000x gains from its days of being cents and a dollar for a btc. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:57:47
Always hodl is terrible advice take profits along the way especially everytime you 2x or more. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:21:18
Well one things for sure and that is Hal finneys kids are well off now. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 03:35:53
Isn't it ironic tho 
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:56:07
A little too ironic 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:37:53
Sorry guys I needed money for a new mansion in Beverly hills and my yacht was getting outdated 
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:14:42
Isn't it ironic how it's negative news story after negative news story days after bloodbath starts.... Hmmmmm 
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:37:17
No I think it will only begin with big positive news like ETFs. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:24:25
This market has always had its cycles what worries me this time as bitcoin is gaining dominance the price isn't going up. This leads me to the conclusion the market is going to crash hard soon. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:30:40
Wait you really think bitcoin can be a global currency (technicals aside let's say it works flawlessly at scale) and used as such? It can never be anything more than a store of value. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 22:44:03
Being a store of value doesn't make it unusable I can use it now to transfer money to friends or family or fund my online sportsbetting account. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:39:22
Stat tuned there's more magic coming 
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:07:07
Yep and the house is gonna win with futures. If you are in the market you just have to pay close attention and make moves first. Timing is everything 
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:53:15
Cash me ousside hou bou dat
@_date: 2018-07-01 15:26:59
Do you remember what the volume looked like before the last chapter started? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:05:43
I can see why you would think so but I would say don't underestimate the power of this magic internet money and the whales that lurk within 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:42:51
That's a suckers game and pure gambling. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:33:21
When will people realize bitcoin is totally under control of futures markets now and it just moves to liquadate positions. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:53:14
8 years later still in alpha stage 
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:58:42
Yeah they are just tanking to death 
@_date: 2018-07-08 01:36:35
Looks great now what do we do with it? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:10:45
1 mil ain't shit.......... but you would nut your pants for months straight if someone gave you a mil today. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:41:33
You haven't seen the magic yet that's the problem. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:51:32
Why are you getting tired of them this is the way to make money in the bear market. Ride the waves and get back to tether we know it's just a short squeeze pretty clear too IMO. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 22:51:01
Yeah I second that fees and what amount did you pull out? How long did it take? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:31:12
This must be from 2011
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:37:33
This would only really be appropriate when btc hits 21k at minimum 
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:22:48
You know you are too obsessed with crypto when you can complete all of this guys comments before he made them. CBOE insurance etc etc etc
