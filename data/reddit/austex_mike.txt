125cc? Shoot, my lawnmower would be a superbike in your country.

Well, considering how slowly they are shipping, I wouldn't count on getting these chips for at least two weeks. (Note: in the BFL universe two weeks = one year.)

Great advice. Thank you so much. The limits and verified accounts issue is something many people do not take into consideration.

Wake me up when they finally ship something.

GPU mining.

Nope. Last update was 5 days ago on Twitter saying they are waiting for a check from the bank. They have $100 of mine. Not much money, but my wife lost her job last week and I'm a stay at home dad to our 2 month old, so we have no income. In a few months a $100 might seem like a lot to us. I'm hoping they fix it soon.

I think you have the old link. I just logged onto silk road no problem. Use Tor and startpage to find the more recent link. 
@_date: 2013-07-15 03:42:55
Just out of curiosity,  how much did they pay you for the domain?

Not working for me. I am just trying to transfer coins to my personal wallet...no luck. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 03:58:25
Two weeks. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:36:15
Nope. I just want to see one ship. They have been claiming they will ship in a week or two for a long time now, yet nothing. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 04:03:52


**Wait, wait! Don't tell me. They will ship in two weeks right?**

I would consider a different approach. How about saving enough money to buy a computer that can mine for you? If you already have a desktop then you can upgrade the video card for $200 and get a hash rate that will let you mine enough to play around with. If you don't have a desktop, consider trying to convince your mother to buy you a new computer and you pitch in your money towards paying for it. If you get a decent system and pool mine you could mine maybe .03-.04 bitcoins a day without much of a problem. 
Convincing her to get into bitcoins could be a very tough sell, so I would look at alternatives.

They said July, they didn't give a year though. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 17:04:55


Holy shit. That is what any of us reading that thought.

If you look straight up you might see a joke.

Bitfloor is becoming the new BFL. Keep hearing promises, but nothing being delivered.

It really makes me wonder if competitors will be able to quickly enter this market and surpass Butterfly if they can arrange the means of production much more quickly. ASICS aren't easy to make at all, but Butterfly is moving so slow I can just imagine a copy cat, perhaps a chinese company, working faster.

I have $98. Seeing these guys lose thousands makes me grateful.
