At the rate at which merchants turn into accepting cryptocurrencies around the world
, i'd suggest anyone to get get as many coins as possible right now. People who do so may enjoy having their next round-the-world trips' expenses covered by this investment.

Mark has been running the most important exchange for years. He has greatly participated in the rise of bitcoin. Insulting him because he was not able to foresee the security breaches of Gox is not fair. Many people would have given up since long in his place. All that I see is someone who actually and genuinely tries to find solutions to a complicated issue right now.

don't waste your time. turn more money into bitcoins, and wait passively til you become wealthy.

According to  and  when the BTC price was below $700/BTC, I have observed that ~5000 BTC were bought in CNY and ~2000 BTC were bought in USD. China's back...

He's not "outdated". He's simply protecting his assets, that the rise of cryptos could devaluate.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:02:30
And you're not the only one... I'm fascinated by this technology. The ore people are scared and sell, the happiest I am. I have been waiting for this bulltrap since the end of december 2013.

Take 2 minutes of your time and 
- ask Apple why they banned the app
- tell them you'd like crypto apps to be present in the appstore
do that on their contact page :

The spread of bad news and shocking headlines about cryptos in media is far better than no news at all for the long-term adoption by the masses. It becomes a common subject of discussion. have a look at the big picture : crypto-currencies are slowly becoming mainstream, but this is not building up at the pace you wanted, judging by the still low market cap, right? Be patient.
