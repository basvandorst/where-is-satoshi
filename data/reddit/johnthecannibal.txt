You mean please leave this here so we can create a circle jerk. The only reason these kind of posts are made. 
It is not relevant to this because it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It doesn't affect Bitcoin. There is no "if banks fail then people will automatically move to Bitcoin". 
I'm reporting this post. 
Also hilarious i'm called a troll because i want to read Bitcoin news in a Bitcoin sub. 
"He doesn't join our circle jerk. He must be a troll or paid shill".

Did you stop using dollars/euros after you find out tons of people got scammed out of their money?
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:28:04
That guy is the typical Bitcoin cultist. He lives in Bitcoin fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:33:57
You mean something like a centralized group of people in control of Bitcoin who decide who can use Bitcoin and who not?
Yeah, sounds like a great idea. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:00:04
Right. That explains it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:45:17
You better stop using Dollars or Euros or whatever you use in real life.

Your level of paranoia is far from healthy. 
Besides that it also makes you look like a complete fool.

I missed what this was all about. I read some things today and i keep seeing the Doge guys being upset about this. How is the Doge community involved? Isn't Mintpal just an alt coin exchange? Not exclusive to Doge?

What's with the extreme paranoia on this sub? The only other places that are this bad are conspiracy sites. 
Especially with the paid shills part. There is no evidence whatsoever that there is even one paid shill here yet every day a dozen people are accused of being one. 
Basically anyone who isn't 100% a Bitcoin supporter is called a paid shill. 
Any explanation for this quite insane behavior?

What lousy article. It's just a tl;dr of the dozens of other articles about this subject that were posted here 2 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 11:55:30
Where did i say they accused me of being a paid shill?
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:13:00
I just read in another post that this scam "is actually a good thing". 
So now you say it isn't it? Very confusing this place. 
Edit: what is it with this sub and the obsessive usage of the downvote option. Why do people feel the need to just constantly downvote everything they don't like? That's not what the voting system is for is it?

And i bet if i post something about tigers here a few people will appreciate it as well. 
Am i gonna post it? No, because i realize this sub is about Bitcoin and the majority of people don't want to see posts about tigers.

"All these scams and people losing money is actually good news" - @_date: 2014-10-19 15:53:01
Wrong sub. Has absolutely nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
Please stick to posting Bitcoin news in the Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:07:11
We know. 3 other people already posted this completely off topic news 2 days ago trying to start a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 11:28:00
I would ban that shit as well. And i love Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 23:08:14
Oh ok. We'll i'm very sorry to make some light fun of the sillyness that often goes on in this sub. 
And yes this place is pretty much a hive mind cult as pretty much everyone knows. 
The way i get downvoted is a perfect example of that. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 16:39:24
Traders don't care about Bitcoin itself. And those are the people who control the price. So this isn't exactly good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 01:16:37
I had no idea. Thanks for explaning that to me.
