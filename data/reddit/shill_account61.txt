Would you mail them cash? This is specifically for anonymous, cash transactions. Surely you aren't thick enough to claim there's no market for that.

No, what you'd rather do is get access to your funds again. Might as well seek official channels in addition to us autists.

I love that this isn't satire. Just wow.

Sort of odd to not be involved at all and only attempt to drag the project down, maybe you should consider something more productive and less sad

This sort of baseless tribalism only makes you look like you know nothing about the space nor do you think of the big picture

I'm curious how a court would even be able to enforce you giving her half. Prove what wallet is mine, prove what half is, etc. 
Forget if you're technologically capable and have heard of monero.

It might. Eth might go to 0, it might go to 100K as well, none of us know. Claiming to know otherwise is intentionally misleading though.

True but being "technically better than coal" doesn't necessarily your technology is green. Btc to the moon and all that but currencies that don't require mining are obviously more sustainable.
