Hey, I enjoyed this post. Learned something about a product I never knew existed, and I do want it! Good luck on your sale and don't worry about the naysayers. I'm okay with this sort of thread!

Donations are where bitcoins really shine, artists could really gain from having btc donations where nothing is cut from what they get, and it gives fans the ability to give them how much they want to, especially after the fact of listening to a good song where they feel like the artists' deserve some money for their efforts.

when was it ever exactly or even vaguely a consistent monthly fluctuation? The time frame we have of Bitcoin prices is way too short to draw many technical analysis patterns reliably.

"he strategy had the gambler double his bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%."
SatoshiDice takes a 1% cut right?

He thinks that bitcrate isn't buying Reddit Gold from Reddit, but only facilitating trade of already existing reddit gold for bitcoins. This is fallacious thinking however.

You go in assuming they will be receptive to your idea when they're clearly not. You suggesting these things without justification will only lead them to mentally ignore your proposal because of any preconceived notions they already have. I would start by addressing their concerns of it being an "internet magic money" with a "Yes, many upon a cursory review of cryptocurrencies one can easily yet incorrectly conclude that, but if you look at it closer.." etc etc. Great time to get into economics (inflation and how it steals their margin) and how they as a business would benefit from its low tx costs

paypal telling their representatives their policy on Bitcoin:
"Clarification on Bitcoin merchants using PayPal 6/10/2013 8:58 AM (-05:00) Impacted market: EMEA
We’ve received a number of escalations regarding Bitcoin merchants using PayPal. Any merchant seeking to sell or buy Bitcoins with PayPal is operating as a financial exchange. Please be aware that Financial Exchange merchants are prohibited unless pre-approved by PayPal. This process involves getting VP approvals from both Risk and Compliance, and only licensed financial institutions are considered.
Merchant contacts
If we receive contacts on Bitcoin sales, instead of escalating further, kindly advise customers that they need to be licensed financial institutions to be considered for approval. However, there are some acceptable cases, as outlined below.
Acceptable Bitcoin business models for PayPal
Merchants with a business model that is related to Bitcoin but does not sell Bitcoins may be acceptable. For example: Merchants offering Bitcoin education packages Merchants selling computer hardware designed specifically for mining Bitcoins. In this case, kindly ensure that the merchant isn’t pre-selling and actually has the equipment ready to deliver.
Please note – All Bitcoin-related e-commerce should be considered high risk."

I use it, but I don't know if i would recommend it to people because it's risky. Margin is a risky and complex subject, and i usually recommend newcomers to use Coinbase. I do love BFX's meta-exchange aspect though.

If the SEC was investigating Pirate BTCST scam...why would they have if Bitcoins aren't securities?  If that pro's logic follows through, then it never would've been in their jurisdiction, I think.
He is also assuming Bitcoin is a currency. I argue (along with Germany) that it behaves like a commodity

have stop losses and place limit buys accordingly on the way down if it happens, that way you catch the falling knife. most likely if someone sells the orderbook down to zero, he/she won't have coins available to buy on the way back up, because it -will- eventually snap back up, as there won't be many coins for sale since they were already sold into, except at the real market price (which might be only a tad bit lower as a result of all the selling pressure). cheap coins for you.

I don't see why not, as long as he's not doing anything criminal. Does he have a US bank account? 
Also, if he has Euros, it may be easier and cheaper just to do a wire transfer instead of converting from fiat=&gt;crypto=&gt;fiat

Arguing semantics here is all, but I think I'm right. You can't move a decimal place, but you can move a decimal point. In the bitcoin protocol, you have to add or remove decimal places. We currently have 8 digits recognized after the decimal point.

i had a rich 'friend' (he's egomaniacal so I don't really consider him a close friend at all) lose low six figures worth while we were in our macro class because he was trading millions worth on volatility just for a few hundred bucks profit/trade to my horror. On the wrong side of JPY/USD when PM Abe announced the debasement of the yen. Bitcoins, I said, buy bitcoins...

OP really could've done better in appealing to a hostile audience ie consider their take. 
"Thank you very much for the help but I hope you reconsider taking Bitcoins.
I think that the cards of humanity are a good match... yadayada... free publicity from the Bitcoin community" 
Q: Why is it important to present both sides of an argument when writing a persuasive message to a potentially hostile audience?
A: It is always important to present both sides of an argument when trying to persuade someone or a group of people because if people do not know the other side of the argument, they do not know why your benefits are greater than theirs. Without providing positives for the other side, you are putting people in a position to not have an opinion.

no because the best economy is with bitcoin. think of it as an economy/market fork. until another altcoin's economy becomes comparable, people are going to join onto the largest one as it's the most useful and has the most liquidity/goods/services/etc offered. none of the other coins provide anything of merit as of yet, which is why for the most part, if this sort of service were to be done, you have to convert from the alt currency to BTC, provided you have someone willing to trade BTC for the altcurrency. there's not many people willing to trade dollars for altcoins for the same reason.  they'd rather trade it for btc.

Those of you obsessing about the price right now have to realize that this is a longterm process that requires maturity and patience.  Most of you are young and not experienced in markets.  These types of grinds have a tendency to shake out the impatient ones.  Don't fall into that trap.
