This is incoherent, voluntary exchange is not stealing. 
stealing is by definition involuntary.

No it wasn't, that is why the case is being appealed to the Supreme Court. The murder for hire allegations were never proven in court but influenced his sentencing.

A crime journal? really? Yeah, people breaking the law always type their crimes in a word document for safekeeping. Have you ever heard of the concept of setting someone up or framing them? None of the evidence that would have supported that case for framing was allowed at the trial.

For credit, you need a massively scaled reputation system (which I think is coming). Cash is just the first building block.

Free just means lack of government rules. I think you are thinking of perfect competition.

The illegal drug trade is free market.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:33:26
That is price/demand elasticity, has nothing to do with it. Free market means free from government control.

Drug suppliers don't have price setting monopolys. The Mexican cartels are not a monopoly, they are competing with each other. Same with the clans in afghanistan growing poppy seeds. There is no monopoly in the illegal drug trade, most of the products can be grown and processed by individuals.

Yeah, I thought it was pretty obvious myself not sure why so many people don't seem to grasp the connection. The "free" in free markets means free from government regulation.

Ethereum has projects in the works that address this issue.

Not sure if it does honestly. I have been dying to try and get my ideas behind how to properly run a discussion/user generated content site popularized but I have no coding skills. I've been using said sites for 15+ years and I know what works. I am hopeful for Akasha, but if it doesn't pan out I will be pushing hard to develop a decentralized reddit killer.

Nailed it. FUD campaign in full swing.

I have many ideas on the subject. First, votes should not be unlimited, the number of upvotes for a user should be limited (maybe 5 a day?) That one rule solves a ton of the spam problems associated with user content sites. Also, their should be a karma/reputation system involved for comments and submissions, and users should get privileges to do more things as they advance. Reddit has rudimentary forms of this but it could be taken much further. I also like the idea of tying some sort of real world asset (crypto) to "karma" in a way that rewards the users that help make the site better. I have many more ideas but I honestly should put a white paper together if I want people to take them seriously.

Oh, seems like a good use case for smart contracts..automate everything so the likelihood of all those possibilities goes down.

What about the coin tumblers?

Governments kill people, media just whines

I complained to coinbase about getting rid of the ACH transfer instant buys and they responded pretty quickly. I wasn't happy that they moved to a higher transaction fee debit card based model, but they did respond pretty promptly.

A huge focus of Ethereum development is to reduce transaction costs, it's a big part of moving over to proof-of-stake.

Just don't mention the taxes and dysfunctional government. The people of Detroit are pretty cool, the people in charge maybe not so much.

Go back to late stage capitalism.

You can believe it all you want, it is very suspicious they openly accused him of it and then didn't try to prove it in court.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:16:48
LOL ok, it literally was a conspiracy if you look at the aftermath with agents going to prison for theft and tampering. If you have evidence, you prove it. Not doing so implies you made them up. It doesn't matter what they already had on him. 
You have your opinion, I have mine. I hope Trump pardons him at some point.
