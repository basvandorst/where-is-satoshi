Every time we get near 11k I’m thinking who’s gonna pull the plug this time..

Looks like a solid consolidation period to me. Intraday corrections, but the general upward trend should continue.

I think for most of us here the accumulation of more bitcoin is the primary objective and probably for the longer term. Liquidating bitcoin at a certain level is understandable, but are these big sellers/buyers then hoping to buy at a lower level or permanently out and holding their remainder for a higher exit? Is there a generally accepted coherent consensus and understanding on these moves?

The drops over the last week have a strong correlation to X factors, that being real or imagined threats of government intervention. These are unnatural to whatever markets forces were at play prior. I look for more rational minds to push bitcoin back into a more normal position by the end of week barring any more crypto hysteria.

Any theories on the persistent 10k push downs? What’s wrong with these people.

This has everything to do with Facebook and Libra. Congress and the public immediately conflate FB and Bitcoin. What they can't understand they can't trust. Great opportunity for the dumbed down press to talk about money laundering and the dark web nonsense. Some do this deliberately others out of ignorance.  
 Just Google search and find the outlandish stories and how Facebook Libra and bitcoin are considered basically the same thing. Mysterious and illicit.  The bitcoin fundamentals are unchanged depending on whether you believe in bitcoin or not.

When do the Libra hearings conclude?

Corrections like this will test your confidence and mettle in bitcoin. Remind yourself that the fundamentals are unchanged. As more institutional and new buyers come in this will happen at a given price point.  
These are buying opportunities. Buying in at \~20k is very painful and expensive.

I called today, not for retail. Institutional only. They have infrastructure, but need regulatory assurances before they go full on. It will be a non insured securities.
