Go on Google Play or Apple, download the Coinbase app and then leave them a 1 star review with comments regarding lack of SegWit. That's what I did. At least that way their rating will suffer and hopefully less people will use their shitty service.

No. All value is subjective. The only exceptions where a case could be made for truly intrinsic value, is in something that sustains life i.e. food, water, oxygen

Someone tell me how UBI doesn't do the exact opposite of its intended purpose. If everyone gets $1000 / month, the smart people and those who have are already wealth will simply save and invest it. The dumb and poor will piss it away as they always do. In the process, you're flooding the country with money which will likely result in increased prices across the board. Wealth inequality will therefore be increased.  
Granted the guy seems to be well meaning and reasonable for a Democrat, but he's still a socialist literally buying votes.
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:07:14
It's become a thing now because socialists need an ever changing routine in order to sell their scam. Increasing taxes has it's ceiling eventually, as leftist useful idiots find it increasingly difficult to sell the idea of 75% theft. So the money needs to come from somewhere and we've already printed a lot of in various other forms. UBI was the next idea on deck. Pitch the sheeple another sky is falling scenario about robots taking all their jobs and claim you're here to save the day.

Somebodies asking for a $5 wrench attack. Not very wise.
@_date: 2019-03-17 05:45:18
I'd be willing to bet the same. Socialism creeps up slowly as each new legislated handout creates more dependents, meaning it's increasingly hard to repeal and undo. You essentially create the problem through compounded, negative, unintended consequences of state intervention in the market, then claim you have the solution, which is yet another legislation attempting to correct for the previous. In this case it's just easier to hand out free money, than to attempt to fix the problem at the root.
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:31:13
Look this stuff doesn't happen overnight, or in a month, or a year. It's completely reasonable, considering this has been talked about for a decade already, and that it will be another 10+ years before we actually see widespread unmanned trucks on the road, that people will shift careers. Why is it we can debate a massively unproven scheme like UBI for years, listen to politician fear mongering about it, while knowing damn well they have incentives to buy votes, yet the effort couldn't have been put into a simple public education program to start preparing people? Somehow, just all of a sudden we need UBI NOW!? It's ridiculous. Cutting the wastefulness is unpopular that's why politicians don't do it!
Another thing is that the economy is like scale that is constantly rebalancing itself. There are millions of individual actors, all with their own unique knowledge and set of circumstances and yet we constantly believe that we can meddle in the market and that politicians know best? Central planning has been proven bullshit time and time again, yet here we are. You're above scenario might seem well thought out, but I guarantee neither you or I can possibly know all the variables involved.
Just as an answer though, I'd say great if a trucking company cuts their costs by 50%, but that doesn't mean they simply pocket the difference and get rich. The result is that shipping costs come down, that means more wealth in the pockets of the individuals who make up the country. Although you can't see it is its distributed across the board, all of these efficiencies over time do have a huge net impact. We can get into why this doesn't seem to be the case necessarily, and that people are struggling relative to 40 years ago, but the answer is extremely complicated. Most western nations are just giant welfare states. Money is stolen from people through taxes, funneled through this giant mess of a system, then a little is given back and it turns out it's not enough. Where that money goes in the meantime, nobody truly knows, as it's simply impossible at this point, but it's going to the non-productive, parasitic, rent seeking class.
Advances in technology mean we ultimately should work less (physically) and produce more. If you had robots that did everything for you, what would you spend your time doing? I think it takes some imagination and I think that it's actually scary for a lot of people, because they lack the creative thinking. What it means imo, is that we transition to a more knowledge based economy. Humans have infinite desires and not everyone needs to be a computer programmer or an engineer in the future. I could sit here all day thinking of new business ideas to start up that would serve people who have more free time on their hands. Skills in the future will continue to be less physical, more knowledge based.
Another good question for leftists is tell me why we need to continue importing 3rd world, low skilled labor into the West, if we're apparently all so shit scared of losing our jobs to automation? How do you think that will work out? Ask yourself why these questions never seem to come up and why it's the same types of people pushing for both of these ideas!

@_date: 2019-02-09 17:59:31
That is a very superficial way of looking at it. You are implying that this is just a greater fools game, which it isn't. This isn't tulip mania and you can Google why that's not the case.
There isn't much to say, but I'll explain anyway. You were holding an asset that appreciated massively against all other assets. You recognized it sooner than others, good for you! If everyone had valued BTC exactly the same, instantaneously the minute the network was turned on, then what would the price be? In $ terms, maybe $10,000,000? How would people come to possess it? You can either trade another asset you own for it, or you can trade your labor for it. The fact is, that something comes to be valued over time and through millions of back and forth exchanges in the market.
If I grow carrots and you grow some newly discovered thing (potatoes?) and all of a sudden everybody wants your potatoes, well what happens? They wall want to trade you their carrots, or common stuff for your newly valued potatoes. The carrot/potato ratio (price) will necessarily increase. I know this is a bad example, since we're talking of things that have almost infinite supply eventually, however it's still valid to show that you are experiencing a disconnect between real world, tangible goods and money or other assets.
You are right in some sense, in that some people cheat their way to wealth through dishonesty however all assets appreciated and depreciate in value relative to one another. If a person speculates that an asset will appreciate and purchases that asset at a low price, there is risk involved. Speculators provide a very valuable service to the market in that they provide market liquidity and price discovery, which should not be dismissed and is not 
As humans all we really have is our labor in order to create value in the world. I can plant seeds, water, tend and harvest them, then eat the produce or exchange it. We don't all have to be performing physical labor to create value in the world. Even physical labor can be very unproductive. Think digging ditches and then filling them back in.
 The value provided to the market as a whole can be hard to imagine in many cases and very hard to measure, however that is what money is in a sense. It's a scorecard of the value you provide. Capital goes where it's treated best and good decision making takes many forms, but is rewarded by the market. Holding Bitcoin is restricting the available supply and signaling that you see value in it, hence the price rise. If it weren't for people using and holding Bitcoin, the price wouldn't rise. If the price didn't rise, the attraction would not be there and we wouldn't be changing the world for the better ultimately.

Bitcoin can have a price of $1 Million per coin simply as store of wealth / digital gold. People aren't transacting in Gold these days and it's a $7 Trillion MCap.
@_date: 2019-12-08 05:24:47
I guess my question then is what is the official price of Bitcoin? When you think about it, as it stands the price can differ slightly from exchange to exchange and also from country to country. The "price" is just the price of the last settled trade on a certain exchange, that's really all it is. I'm sure at times one exchange/country leads and at other times the opposite. What about when companies in other countries offer futures trading? I have my doubts about whether it will be so easy for them to actually supress the price of BTC. The other thing will be the overall skeptical nature of crypto users. I'd like to think we'd be holding these pricks accountable.
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:38:38
Right. I think you could make the case that IF anything has "intrinsic value", it would be food and water. But really, nothing is valuable in and of itself. Value is a human concept I think, but food and water must be the base of the pyramid, since without them there is no life.

I agree, but I think much of the point of this exercise is to hold these exchanges accountable. If everyone withdraws and they can't honor the withdrawals, then they're caught red handed. IMO it's more of a side benefit that people might learn about holding their own keys.

@_date: 2019-01-26 17:39:25
I think you're correct, almost none of them have any real use case, however I don't think the masses have caught on to that. Therefore I believe most alts will have yet another massive run up in unison with BTC during the next bull run. They will outperform BTC in terms of percent gains once again, but also crash much harder as always. I would say hold alts as well to make huge gains, but then gtfo and trade back into BTC (or USD) before the subsequent correction.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:40:56
You're stupid to be advertising that have BTC on your license plate. At some point, he'll get jumped and beaten with a wrench in order to disclose his private keys.

It's really the height of arrogance to think your opinion matters regarding the best use case for Gold. The market is what it is. The market has spoken and Gold has been the agreed upon store of value. Do you not think that a global, non-sovereign asset would be of huge value to the world? What value do you think it might have? Hint: Look at the current market cap of Gold :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:53:45
1. Your hypothesis about Gold being wasted on it's SOV use case may be correct as BTC displaces it, however as of now, it's arrogant to go ahead and assert that when the market is literally telling us that Gold (historically) is in fact more valuable as a SOV, than as used for anything else. I think that distinction should be made. Personally I check my biases against the market and whether I like it or not, I conclude that my opinion is perhaps incorrect.
2. Yes Bitcoin, I agree! Was simply pointing out that prior to BTC, Gold was serving this purpose and that we can see what it's value was in USD terms by observing it's large market cap in USD terms. I'm pointing out here that we have these objective metrics (price, mcap, etc.) by which to validate ones own personal hypothesis'.

The majority of people can't hold onto anything i.e. stocks, dollars, crypto for any amount of time. They either need the cash back, which means they've invested more than they should've, or they feel they need to be more pro-active and therefore they trade or sell because they're bored, impatient, etc.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:28:24
Sounds like you're investing more than you can comfortably afford if that's the case.
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:48:57
Sort of agree, but I think you're wrong in regards to "no other rational investor holds a declining asset..."  
Many **speculators** hold declining, or what they perceive to be undervalued assets. 
I think the distinction really needs to be made here between speculation and investment. Investments typically give you an ROI. Some stocks do, if they pay dividends. Many don't. Stocks in general, and crypto/gold are speculative. Crypto and Gold differ in that they don't have any counter party risk. None of the above pay dividends (with the exception of some stocks).
Speculation about future value is what you're referring to and that happens all of the time. Resource investors, for example can't wait to get their hands on cheaper Uranium shares right now. Their thesis is that nuclear power is the only truly green (viable) energy we have at the moment and that it's going to be very necessary in the coming years.

Well, what exactly backs Gold and Silver? Can't one pose the same question? At the end of the day, it's only the fact that people value Gold and Silver that give them value. If you want to argue that Gold and Silver have uses outside of money, that's still just their utility. BTC has utility as a value/ownership transfer network. Gold and Silver don't need to be "backed" by anything other than their perceived usefulness and value as shiny objects. BTC doesn't need to be backed either. Nothing has intrinsic value to humans except for maybe food and water.

Haha thanks I'm working on it. That's crazy 50k net!? That must be quite the cost in inventory lol.
Well, a lot of it may implode of course, but I if you stick with your top 10 market cap coins I think the chances are less of that happening. BTC, LTC, maybe ETH, XRP. Probably gonna be a few years yet before we reach peak insanity, then crashes, then a few with actual use cases will remain long term. Just my 2 cents. Don't want you to miss out! :)

Ya I am doing private label, but trying to develop my website and brand so that I'm not dependent on Amazon. That's the hard part though haha! Amazon is easy, but you also have zero control. Need to figure out how to get traffic to my site, so I can actually build a sellable asset.
No, you're right, it's best to wait until a decent pullback in price. Lately it's been crazy, like the other day when it dropped $800, but it shot back up too quickly for most people to catch it. I can see it going higher again and then having another decent dip though. My personal target is something like $20k - $50k in the next few years. My view is that it either becomes insanely high value, or it fails catastrophically due to fatal flaw of some kind. Like I said, probably wise to spread out your funds into a few of the top 5 or 10 MCap. coins.
