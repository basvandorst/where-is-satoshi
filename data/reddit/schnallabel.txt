Came here from r/all. Must've scrolled down too far.
Jesus Christ tho. Are you really comparing bitcoin to the invention of the lightbulb? Don't you think that's a bit... arrogant? I'm not saying bitcoin is going to flop, but it's not a goddamn lightbulb. The average Joe can switch on a lightbulb. The average Joe does not know how bitcoin works, or even what you do with it, and the average Joe probably wouldn't even be capable of using it at this stage if he knew what to do with it.
You guys have a lot of things to sort out before the average person could even consider using bitcoin for anything. This list is full of inventions average people use. Instead of -whatever this is-, realize that it *does* have shortcomings, and it's *not something for the average person.* Until it *is* something for the average person, **stop comparing it to things for the average person.**

How dense are you? That's exactly the point my comment is trying to make. With every new invention it's necessary to straighten out the rough edges before it's ready to be adopted by the average consumer, but these new inventions weren't truly great until they *had* straightened out the edges.
While I understand you guys need to get a positive attitude going, saying "They laughed at Einstein!" isn't going to make bitcoin better. Working out the kinks is going to make bitcoin better. Celebrating and putting it on a pedestal before you've worked out *how* to do that is not making bitcoin better, it just makes you guys look arrogant.
