Sounds like you already see the problems with the fiat currencies, but struggle with some common misconceptions about bitcoin.


0.58 USD / mBTC, not so bad. the fees on exchanges isn't terrible.


no real problems lately. some challenges yes, but IMO nothing too worrying.


Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency and so far the project is doing better than anyone predicted. Many bitcoin clones were made as scams, and quickly died off, not really to anyone's surprise as anyone can make their own clone of bitcoin. What makes you think bitcoin won't stay around?

Seeing the news today, it seems someone had a similar idea as yours at MIT. I have no idea how they managed to raise so much money but I think this is great and hopefully surrounding businesses will start accepting bitcoin, and more schools will do similar experiments in the future. I did not consider schools as a place for "airdrops" and it just seems like a great idea, especially at technological schools.

So far I've only heard of scamming from one web-based generator (bitcoinvanity(dot)appspot(dot)com).
Most sensible bitcoiners will use a self compiled version of vanitygen.

hotels.com, although they do not sell hotels =)
You are right that it is pretty uncommon, but I think it is not such a bad idea for a bitcoin service as there are few big names at this point. New users might chose to go with a company with a literal name that pops up on top of a google search for a service like a bitcoin wallet.

All dollar bills are fundamentally equally worthless pieces of paper, unless you consider how many dollars they are worth. There is no reason to expect an even distribution in value of the different denominations of dollar bills.
I.e. if someone fired up the printing press and doubled the number of 5 dollar bills, the value of every 5 dollar bill would be affected the same as every 1 dollar bill, not create a situation where you would get 2x$5 bills for every 5 $1 dollar bill.

He isn't talking about a shortage on currency but rather the commonly heard worries about the (eventually) deflationary nature of bitcoin. The last sentence in that quote would show this better if it read:

I imagine this would be hard to do on a large scale. It is impossible to determine if someone already owns bitcoin, and I imagine many people might have a bad reaction to it if they are given a very small amount of money that to them seem difficult to use. However, maybe a store or business that supports bitcoin could hand out bitcoins from a stand instead of vouchers if they could set it up so that they got most of their coins back.
It is also possible to encourage bitcoin holders to help their friends set up a wallet and give them some to get them started, but I'm sure most bitcoiners do this anyway. 
I recently gave a friend 10$ in bitcoin and set him up with a wallet and told him about humble bundle as he is a PC gamer. It is great to see someone take an interest in bitcoin because they see how easy it can be to transfer money online. We should focus on informing those who take an interest by themselves though and not force it on people.

I have never heard anyone talk about different denominations as separate currencies before. There are no parallels between denominations of the dollar and different cryptocurrencies.


No, but why does this matter? An alt-coin is not like the cents to the bitcoins dollar. I usually think of them as either experiments or scams, and their value in bitcoin is not very interesting unless you are speculating in it in my view.
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:36:32


This does not make sense. I don't think he understands bitcoin very well. 5 BTC has the same fixed ratio with 1 BTC.
If he thinks exchange rate fluctuations between bitcoin and altcoins will be a problem, he should consider that prices likely will be set in bitcoin (or USD equivalent in bitcoin) and those who invest in altcoins are playing a high risk/reward game that doesn't carry any risk into a BTC transaction.

Hmm, not in the scenario I was thinking of right there. It would be more like a campaign for a business, but maybe if it was done for some community store or something like that. I just think it has to be on a smaller scale to make each drop/gift more valuable and less likely to be exploited.

* More transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking

I would suggest doing what OP is trying to do and move whatever amount you want to save for a long time into paper wallets with encrypted digital versions as backup.
Armory could be used for offline backup as well, but the private keys alone are easier to access if you are not on your own computer. 
Truecrypt is good for encrypting a folder or an entire partition, but in this case an encrypted file is sufficient.
Mobile wallets are not very secure IMO and you should at least have every address backed up on your computer.

The content providers would want to sell the bitcoins they get so they would sit on fiat in the end. That means that in a short while the coins bought by the consumers would come from the content providers and not from the other coins on the market, thus not forcing the price up like in your calculation.

Thank you for accepting Bitcoin, but I would suggest putting some work into the website. Especially the translations are terrible. 
Also free shipping sounds good, but it is obvious that a shipping price to my country of over 20$ on the first item is included in the price.

It is not a problem. For most transaction you do not need to wait for it to be included in the blockchain. 
When bitcoin is used in a POS there will be protection against double spend race attacks. 
Also there is nothing stopping systems similar to the CC systems, that protects both the buyer and seller, to be implemented on top of the bitcoin protocol.

First off, buy just a little and learn how to secure your bitcoin. 
If you are going to hold for a long time you might as well buy now. There could be a crash soon but I don't think it will be too dramatic and I think the recovery will be faster this time. 
If you want to make a profit short term, watch the charts and buy in on what seems like a low point. I would suggest around $320 because I think we will swing around $350 for a few days.

I agree that it works for uTorrent, but my point is that it is incorrect and would be bad when it comes to currency. If you talk to an engineer and say you measure 50 yu-volt you are going to sound pretty stupid.
Bitcoin is pretty complicated to get into at this point and decimal point confusion is not the main thing stopping wider adoption. I think when it becomes more accessible we will automatically see vendors start listing prices in mB. And we can talk about microbits or microcoins when we get there.

If you designed the page differently you wouldn't have to do it that way. You could have a good translation that is static, and maybe let the item descriptions be in English.

Probably not. Just immediately move the coins to your own wallet after receiving the private key.
