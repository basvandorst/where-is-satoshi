You think so?

Yes, popular intrests fuels its rise. However, when the 'get rich fast' expectations of those people are not met, they withdraw their money and very often are sour and tend to madmouth the investment that 'got them only meager 10% instead of lambo'. The true, steady rise in price is created by  increased use, acceptation and trust.

Yes, but he has been investing for like 3 times more than average user of this sub has lived. He is long term investor and there are some serious long term problems with crypto - if governments will see it detrimental for them for any reason, they can just sign a bill that having crypto is illegal... the reason can be whatever, like terrorism, drugs, yada yada.

Well, on your place I would sell, but not quite now. The long term BTC is bearish - to 7600~ at least, then we would need to see what happens. But right now, I mean today, we possibly could see rebound, even to around 13000-13500 (or if market is very weak: 12200). I would have waited for that rebound and then sold. Right now it is about how to safeguard as much profit as possible. You still have made huge profit. &amp;nbsp;
You can see my post history if you want some confirmation. I've known about the crash from 19k would begin 1 month ago, I knew that downward correction would resume after the rebound (although I thougth its top would be at 16k not 17k). Lately some guy asked what he should do about his ETH - I told him at 1300 that I would have sold it all now, because it's about to hit the fan. This was merely 4 days ago, today ETH hit 850.

When we were at the bottom at 12100 on 30 Dec, I've calculated the top at 15900-16050. Both wave structure and the channel created from the first leg up are pointing out that now is the last push upwards, and then downward trend. I still stand by my roof of 15900-16050. From the techical analysis POV, the signs are very bearish. I have sold everything at 15900.

No one knows what anything intrinsic value is. If you had a shed of economic knowledge you would've known that basic problem of economics.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:24:24
That is not to be seen. I've already made my bids and I've shorted bitcoin three times since it was 19k$. The correction now is much less predictable and I do not plan to play with it. I've already finished my monetary journey with BTC as for now, but I'm an opportunist and I might short a few more times.


It is supported by my analysis I my knowledge, based on observation of BTC and other markets since 2012, therefore it has value to me. You remain strong in words, but  the fall that has happened a few days ago, which was an obvious for me and people near me, you deemed impossible. You can clearly see now that market structure and movements are completely different than they were pre-December 16. Nevertheless, I wish you luck and patience. You will need both of them in coming months.

Well, I propose you to save this comment and read it to yourself exacly after one month. What a lesson in humility it will be. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:37


Almost all of them. :)
I thought it would be best to let the charts talk. We will still see and upward retracement for a few thousand dolars, but as for the Bitcoin, it is over, it will not reach new high. At least in a few years.

* Read about Tulipmania in XVII century. Then look at [this graph](
* Learn a bit about BTC history and look at [this chart from 2013](
* Think for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:48:29
Well, log scale also doesn't show 'bubble' pops that well. In such a long time frame log scale is highly weighted towards overall movement of asset. If BTC had similar value drop as it has post dec-13' so from 1200$-150$, so ~85% drop (which now would be to around 3000$) wouldn't you have problem with that? I do not know any other commodity or currency pair that has that much tendency for boom-bust cycles. Well thankfully, we can make money while it falls. :) (well besides that, I think your critique was the most constructive I had read in the Internet in a long time)
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:56:38
Man, that 'physiology' bit was so ridiculously stupid that I am baffled if it was irony. :P
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:34:34
Well, you mean that Bitcoin was [STRONG for 8 years and bubbles, if happen, last months?](
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:31:00
The only money you have made, is the money you have on your bank account. Trust your gut and the chart.
Look on chart of BTC [at the end of 2013]( and compare it to current situation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:50:05
Haha, thanks. We will still see an upward rebound for a few thousand (over time), but it will not reach new top. Then we will see slow, steady decline. If you look at BTC chart now, it is like definition of bubble. :P
@_date: 2018-03-07 10:42:41
Yes, indeed. What credentials about understanding economy could former International Monetary Fund chief and a Harvard professor have? In contrast to us, the enlightened reddit posters. :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:51:30
Because if it falls to 2,5k$ in the short run, and you buy and hold from there, you get 3 times more bitcoin and 3 times more money in that 2021. That's not rocket science.
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:15:10
You put it very nicely - it has destructive capability for economy. And mr Rogoff - economist from article -
 understands economy and politics. The problem with long term success of all cryptocurrencies is the 'crypto-' part. ALL governments like the same things: taxes, control and giving bullshit excuses to eliminate things, which they do not like. That is I think, what the economist means - it can be used for money laundering, terrorist funding and tax evasion and we know it is true. It can be used for many more things beside that, but the Uncle Sam does not give a shit.
Let's assume that European Union decides that crypto is a threat to tax revenues and they pass a law: 


What would you do in that situation? I would sell all my crypto AT THE SPOT and so the rest of the world would do the same. Even if you do not live in our imaginary EU, after that type of news price would plummet to the fraction of what it is now. And if you live in EU - would you willingly became criminal, because you believe in the potential of blockchain technology? And it would be very easy to prove that you have crypto - you probably paid real money to the major exchange and then bought crypto - and government could easily make both banks and exchanges release information about their clients - because 'terrorism'.
And the worst thing is that, the majority of population would accept this decision, because if you envelop crypto in a story of 'terrorism, money laundering and tax evasion', 90% of people would buy it.
That is the cold truth - if crypto should pose a threat to any conventional currency or bigger government - it would be destroyed with one signature.

They are tools - if you can use the tool it is of great use - you can put down nail with your hands or hammer. But if you cannot use it - you will end up with broken fingers.
Besides that, in a movement up you always get small reversals and vice versa.

Well, if you use log scale, then dotcom bubble did not happen, neither did financial crisis of 2007.

People don't want to hear logic or educated opinion. They want to you to conform to what they believe.

Well, from Elliott Wave perspective it is not necessarily wave 4 (but it could be). It could be just 5-3-5 either simple ZZ or part of bigger correction (flat, triangle, combination).
From my experience, end of wave 3 is most trecherous place to get into the trade. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:32:10
Yes, but still. It's better to sell 1 BTC at 19k and then rebuy 4 BTC at around 5k. Nevertheless, in the very long term you still are in profit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:44:51
I'm sorry for such a long response, but I prefer to talk with charts, instead of words. I hope that you managed to save some of your profits.
We will hit either 4300 or 3000 and after that we will have very significant rebound for a few thousands up. Once again, I wish you luck and patience. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:24:02
Well, this 'imagination' of buying and selling does not work as well as you would think. It does not emulate emotions of trading/holding well enough. I've also tried this a few years back, but simply it is not objecitve enough. I encourage you to open demo account on forex exchange that has bitcoin, like easymarkets. It will be much easier for you to learn that way.
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:47:56
'This time is different!'
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:28:22
Check my tradingview post. It is very possible that we will reach 4300$ then we will see rebound to like 10-14k$. Tripling your money in a few weeks is better than lottery, I think. :P

Well, the two other 'old men' that you mentioned, are on the absolute peak of the world. Richest people from the whole world - we are talking number 2 and 3 from world population of 7 billion. One is investor and second one is IT specialist. Well, they are on the place they are, because of their wits and ability to assess and see into the future. Bitcoin is on the verge of this two fields of knowledge, in which Gates and Buffett are the most accomplished men from the all of the world. I do not think, that disregarding their opinion, because 'old men' is in any way conductive to objective assessment.
The problem with crypto is that this is not only technology - but also a currency. And for me, this is the greatest problem that it has on it's way. Breakthrough discoveries like cars, the Internet and the computers were something that was 'addition to the life' from the point of view of the State... and was implemented to help the state.
Bitcoin and crypto, on the other hand, is a direct competition (in the long run) to one of the State's biggest tools for control - fiat money. And that I think is the greatest danger that crypto can have on its way - because honestly, all cryptos can be absolutely butchered by one legislature by major power.

$4.3k should be the point for bigger reversal, but still inside the corrective market. We will surely be above 7k after reaching $4.3
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:37:25
For technical analysis it is best to start simple and test each indicator on its own. It takes time. One thing to remember is that indicators used with some parameters on BTC market may be useful, they may be complete garbage on for example XRP. Basically, the simpler the better if you are starting. 


* Fibo retracements - very useful, especially if it collides with support/resistance
* Channels - useful, but more useful in stable markets, in BTC right now channel direction (short term) does change after a few days or even less
* RSI - divergence is a good way to spot the bottoms (it takes 5 min to learn that)
* Elliott/Patterns - very, very useful, but takes a lot of time to master

Based on comments in the crypto-related subs, this is 'current gen'. :P
