Watch the depth charts at the GDAX-exchange. Both interesting and addictive
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:17:17
Damn, eating through those sell orders
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:20:20
And your reason?
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:22:45
Congrats! Could go up to millions U.S. dollars, so you’re still early. The question really is how cheap the $ will be.

@_date: 2017-12-23 13:49:22
Yeees pleease
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:55:43
Good luck, and welcome on board!
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:44:30
This is too funny.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:25:02
I really need to know as well.

Your Coinbase and blockchain.info are basically the same. Both are wallets, Coinbase support ethereum as well.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:02:38
Let’s e-mail them and bring them in
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:01:42
No idea. But I'm hodling, that's for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:55:56
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:51:43
Saftey first!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:24:45
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:59:28
Good luck, man. I love reddit

And now you’re «between jobs»?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:41
Just bought $100 as well. Feels right even is it dips.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:57:57
Yep. Was my first exchange in bittrex so I just thought I made a mistake, but I tried with eth a couple of minutes later without problems.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:03:32
Congrats guys! My first €100 has grown a lot since I bought in (I have purchased more since then as it’s been a great climb all the way, though there has been dips). The one word is hodl, and you’ll enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:08:38
Exactly. Bcash is shit.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:57:23
I’m sorry for not being able to help u out, but may a noob ask why you are moving from blockchain to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:42:56
A sell order wall that is tearing apart 
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:32:02
This. Dick swingers
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:17:13
I guess there's no need to hold the B2X for any time at all, then?
edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:07:20
Before that one is broken down, btc won’t cross $10k at GDAX has it has on some other exchanges today. Very expected and it’ll shrink.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:20:54
I’m buying more at every pay check and hodling. The potential value of btc in a couple of years ... We’re talking peanuts. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:01:06
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:09:40
People really need to see this.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:33:53
Congrats! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:11:57
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:18:49
Thanks for spending precious time for the greater good.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:24:20
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:08:33
No worries, fiat is slowww
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:52
Perfect opportunity for newcomers
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:39:18
Duh. Let them fly.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:12:41
Buy n hodl
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:06:41
Stop watching the price hour by hour.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:20
No stress, guys. Hodl and laugh.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:56:32
Get in!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:35
I’m langing so hard at thiz. Cash wanker.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:35:24
So basically I’ll just have to wait the required days? Thanks for the swift reply. 
Edit: ... or would it be possible to buy btc from another service in the meantime?
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:54:03
I'm pretty sure we'll see a new ATH prior to the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:11:09
Always hodl on. Orders ready at sub 10k
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:01:12
Please, just google it and make up your own mind. You’ll probably like what you learn.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:41
Thanks. I'm buying.
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:17:49
Because there are more innovative ways to scale bitcoin that don’t compromise decentralisation.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:41:23
What’s up with the bcash pump? Roger been stacking up btc during crash? Was hoping for bash’ death after this crash.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:45:26
It's all good. Go for it.
