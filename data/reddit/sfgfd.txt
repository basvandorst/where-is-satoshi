You still don't get it,your too stuck on the concept of mining. And btw you would have a higher % then you started with in 10 years because bitshares doesn't dilute it's shares, it does stock buybacks decreasing the number of shares. It's a blockchain based company that is in the business of creating financial derivatives. You obviously have not done your research and are trolling probably because you own bitcoin. Bitcoin started out with a higher concentration of wealth than bitshares will ever have, even after all the bit coins are mined.

Correct. I am not a alpha tester. My limited knowledge is purely from looking over the forums and reading.  When your talking about these other features you do not mean the trust less asset feature do you. I'm more interested in the msc/bitshares asset features than something like a savings wallet.

Also if you want to talk about centralization we should be talking about mining pools. Bit coin mining is uber centralized right now.  
@_date: 2014-01-11 08:37:16
Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

I thought Jeffrey was a little too excited.  I think Peter is coming around secretly but that is not the impression he is giving off in public.  He has been on a bunch of shows talking about how bitcoin is worthless and when he was interviewed on about his metals dealer accepting bitcoin he said something along the lines of "I'm not accepting it, bitpay is accepting it and I'm just giving early adopters a way out of this bubble"
I think he will be telling people to buy bitcoin soon enough, he just is stubborn.

I do have a problem with the launch but that is secondary. What I don't like about quark is that it is marketed as a better/more secure bitcoin which is simply untrue, and when it came out it only got attention because bill still and max keiser were essentially bribed with a large amount of coins to "pump it". It seemed confusing and dishonest to the new members of the cryptocoin community. There are a few crypto's I like, there are a smaller number that I am willing to invest in, and an even smaller number that will probably succeed. Everyone must make up there own minds, but quark does not fall onto any one of those 3 lists for me.

In my opinion we are still in the early adopter phase. People were saying it passed @ 100 and before that @ 10. It's all a matter of perspective, but if you have "adopted" bitcoin than you are ahead of 99.9% of the world.

If you really think it's better than bitcoin you should fork it, distribute it in a fair way, and try to get people to use it. But no.... It's a get rick quick scheme that involved a few people quietly amassing all the coins and then bribing Internet personalities to sing its praise.

I'm saying you are using a vague term "medical experts" to try and prove something ridiculous without actually backing anything up. There are many medical experts who have come to the conclusion that weed not a problem at all and is in fact extremely beneficial as medicine in many cases.  Glaucoma, cataracts, depression, cancer.  And yes. I am saying these anon medical experts you site are liars probably due to there own agendas and that of their benefactors.

Funny... I was just thinking that you don't know what your talking about and are just repeating what you have heard. As long as they are not high while flying the plane their weed use matters to me just as much as if they were to drink a beer. I would also have a problem with a pilot drinking a beer while flying me. 
Edit: It seems as though we have very different views on weed, and we both have beliefs about eachother's paradigm that serve to undermine the the opposing opinion. I'm sure we could go back and forth for a very long time on this subject. I would prefer to just respectfully agree to disagree on this one xb102. I don't think we are really gonna get anywhere.

"Litecoin is the silver to bitcoins gold" is a dumb marketing gimmick and the only reason litecoin has survived.  That and all the old btc people who mined on gpu's are pushing it cause greed.  They are some of the most pointless altcoins out there.  If you are planning on going down the altcoin road at least don't fall for the "litecoin is the silver" bullshit.

It's a way to fund and speculate on future decentralized, open source projects.  
Protoshares were put out by a company called invictus innovations, but they are much bigger than a single company. Invictus is making open source DACS (distributed autonomous corps) and building a library of code to empower others to do the same.  As people build DACS if they want to leverage the protoshare community they will divide up at least 10% of their idea between protoshare owners.  The community includes marketing professionals, graphic designers, software engineers, investors, lawyers, and anybody else who wants to lend a hand.  There is also a multi million dollar fund dedicated to funding projects that want to honor protoshares.  Invictus is one player within the system that will be releasing software that honors protoshares.  Early DACS include gambling, currency/stock/commodity exchanges, a distributed DNS system.. And many more to follow.   For more information check out invictus.io or bitsharetalk. 
Disclaimer. I am not associated with invictus but I do own protoshares.

Bitcoin has a worse distribution. 10% is held by one person and or group, and then at least another 1% with the winklevi. But I'm not even trying to say that is bad. I'm just merely pointing out the irony of this statement.

Bitcoin can be traded off chain at any speed your computers are capable of. Trading on derivatives is probably how HFT will happen. 
Right now bitcoin is divisible by 8 digits, or one hundred million pieces. This is just a arbitrary limit that is set currently so people have a hard time spamming the network.  If we ever get anywhere close to needing more digits, moving more digits in would be trivial.  
@_date: 2014-10-08 05:15:43
All these communities are like that. I just got ganged by the NXT crowd for engaging their forum in discussion that was meant to help. The bitshares guys won't consider anything else. I'll probably get downvoted here for trying to support those other two communities even though I've been an avid bitcoiner since 30$. People are blinded by greed in all these communities. They support that which confirms their bias and dismiss anything else.  I've been guilty of the same before.

There are many more people than that who use bitcoin. It's not really a stock. It is a payment network with a currency built into it. If you do a little research you might come to the conclusion that it is the coolest payment network around, but that is for you to decide.

Using electrum normally will link your electrum addresses together.  No special trick, just how the wallet works behind the GUI.  I'm not saying this makes it harder for coinbase to track you.

Yes the problem that you bring up is not a very nice one to have. Assuming that you are not dealing with an outright scam, it is only possible to run into a "run on the bank" problem in a fractional reserve scenario. It's a little convoluted because we are discussing promissory notes backed by what used to be promissory notes, but are now a Ponzi scheme that we choose to refer to as a fiat scheme.

If your looking for a "top notch rig at the end of it if I get anywhere that can keep me gaming happily for a while :)" I say go for it, mine some btc or ltc, have some fun. If your profit driven I sugest investing in BTC then using them to buy shares of a company like ASIC miner. You get paid dividends from mining, you don't have to worry about your hardware becoming obsolete, and honestly you'll probably make more money. But if you want to mine and game go for it.

It's also misinformation.  That is under the assumption that 1 address equal 1 person. I have over 20 wallets, a ton of wallets have pennies and have never been spent 
(probably from people going to faucets then losing either interest or their private keys, I'm guilty of this)
And a lot of the bigger wallets are businesses or exchanges that pool their users coins.

I believe in your scenario arbitrage would quickly bring the markets back to equilibrium. 
Correct me if I'm misunderstanding you but this is essentially someone selling paper gold for less than the market price of paper gold..... The seller is an idiot and arbitrage commences.  The only time the market doesn't revert back to equilibrium is when the issuer refuses to honor the bearer bond.

My prediction is that bitcoin will slowly go up until we get closer to the zig gap or zig zag or whatever news. January and February will be the next order of magnitude jump, and in my opinion will be the push that breaks through into mainstream culture.  Up until now they have been pointing and giggling.  Come zig zap in January and they will be lining up to join us.

So it become easier to pull of a double spend as you control more of the network (hashing power). The network is growing exponentially at this point as new asics are made and new miners come online. It is currently getting 15-30% harder every 2 weeks and these % gains are compounding on eachother..

By the nature of open source software everyone already gets to vote, the miners have slightly more power in the sense that they can choose which blockchain to mine. The BTC foundation already has a target on it as shown by the cease and disist letter today (although comical it is a statement). Any other centralized organization will 1. have a target on it, and 2. be open for corruption. We have an amazing system now, a better system then you have suggested, why fix it?

Thank you for your response, 
I think of bitcoin more as TCP/IP than netscape. And I think to be fair it is inaccurate to say quark is more secure because of those factors. For instance 6 algo's doesn't translate into 6x security, just as faster confirmations don't necessarily mean more secure confirmations. Also things like CPU mining mean that the coin is a target for botnets. Not saying bitcoin is the best in all these categories, just pointing out that alt's make wild claims.

I think it's mostly cause you put a reddit post up to a bitcoin talk post and both were asking people to send bitcoins to un verified adresses.

Yo Active Mining's machines are they way to go. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:06:59
The rate of btc generation is fixed and descending slowly. Eventually it will stop in about 2140 when there are 21 million coins. The coins that are created are split up between the miners in proportion to the percentage of computational power that that miner adds to the network. More miners=more people competing for the same coins. This means that what makes the price of mining go up or down is how many people are trying to mine, and how good their machines are. Now if that determines the cost of mining you might ask how that ties into the cost of a bitcoin. Like gold, the price of a bitcoin goes up because there are only so many of them, and alot of people want them. If the price goes up then there is an incentive for more people to mine because they can make a profit, if the price goes down less people will mine because they aren't making a profit. Once the profit seekers stop mining bitcoins the cost to mine them goes down and there is again incentive to mine. The system keeps itself in equilibrium in this way.
TL/DR: It is more accurate to say that the cost of mining is controlled by the price of a bitcoin, than to say the price of a bitcoin is limited by the cost of mining. 
This guy Hall has it backwards, Robert Hall "In principle, production cost puts a ceiling on its value," I don't think he gets it.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:29:06
Everyone mining is trying to get the same number of coins so the more people mining the less coins you get for the same computing power.

Bitcoin is great for the sex industry. Almost instantaneous, completely irreversible, and pseudo anonymous. You can receive payment before hand or in person. It's as easy as giving the client your wallet address, or a QR code even can be scanned right from a smart phone.

Trust me. That is how open source software works. Bitcoin is just a piece of code that we are all agreeing to run. Anyone can change it and start running their version.

I'm sorry, that wasn't very clear was it.  What I mean is that the "yearly returns" can be increased by buying more shares with the dividends given out each week. You can put the money you make each week to work making more money thus increasing the amount you are paid in dividends throughout the year. this is cool assuming that the price of shares is either stable or goes up. If the value of shares go down you lose out obviously

Because of the way that blocks are mined and difficulty of mining is calculated it will probably be a tiny bit sooner, but not enough to matter in the long run. Like if we are theoretically able to mine 25 bitcoins every 10 min right now, it is actually taking slightly more or slightly less than 10 min, but not enough to change the incentives in the system.

Honestly I'm not the type to get into heated debates on here, I just want you to know thats not what I'm trying to do. You're right about the account being relevant to BTC, hugely so. There are a lot of articles going around right now about the US Gov attacking BTC and freezing bitcoins. My OP was a reaction to this post but also to the general sentiment being propagated right now by all these "financial buff" TV and Blog personalities. I think that why some people are being angry about the whole matter.  The reality is GOX was operating an account with a payment processor illegally and got called on it. That is being exaggerated by a great many people right now and has turned into the fed is attacking/freezing BTC. I myself, and I think most of the people here, am frustrated by the misinformation in general. Your title, while not being wrong, is a little sensationalist.

It's the same principle as if we used gold as a currency. Sure the gov could still use it to finance a war, but they would have to acquire it instead of conjour it. This would severely limit the power that the gov has to do battle and would make it much more appealing to come to a peaceful resolution. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:53:48

The "congress" doesn't get to decide this, the users do. You, congress, even batman could change the block size limit anytime you want, you just have to get most of the users of bitcoin to update to your software. Thats like congress voting on the USA language. It wouldn't mean shit, people would continue speaking whatever the hell they wanted. Centralization is not good for money, thats why we are using bitcoin in the first place.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:02:05

Oh I get it, you want to debate wether or not bitcoins have value to the world. I'm not interested in changing your mind. Find someone else.
Edit: just took a look at your history, only 12 days but you seem legit. I honestly just thought you were trying to argue, I would say bitcoin has immense value for many different reasons including negligent fee's, security, and its api that can be built off of just to name a couple, the average person will probably buy bitcoin at first because of either greed or herd mentality, but that doesn't matter once they start using it. What for? many many different things my friend, think paper money but more useful.

PM him on bitcointalk. 
They trade on bitfunder, havelock, and btco. However bitfunder is shutting down so don't go there, but havelock was just bought up and legitamized so go with them. sry that was confusing, im a little stoned. 
The Problem that I see is that if you transfer them to ASICBurnside you probably sent the to the owner of btco. I cannot verify that he is behind that but it is his name. I think your best bet is to PM him first if your sure that you transfered them to ASICBurnside. If you can convince him you're not full of shit, and if he's a good dude then maybe he'll do something.
but before you do anything you should probably figure out exactly what happened, can you get any screenshots, would go a long way with burnside probably.

First off your totally right, also while jdkeith did not explicitly state this I think he is getting at the idea that p2p bitcoin transactions are unstoppable.

@_date: 2013-09-25 22:18:49
No.  They are a threat to your computer, but bitcoins have a hard limit. They inflate at a steady rate of (currently) 25 bitcoins every 10 min. The inflation rate cuts in half every so often so in 2016 there will be 12.5 every 10 min, then in a few years 6.25 ect. This will stop around 2140 when 21 million coins have been mined and no more will be created.

I can't verify this with proof but I promise I'm no troll. I believe MT. GOX owns a company that is supposed to fill the same hole in litecoin that bitpay does in bitcoin. I remember reading about it right after the bubble in april earlier this year. The problem is this is MT. GOX we are talking about and the business was still being set up (not functional yet). 
Edit: Might have been through a shell company or something, I just remember reading that the ownership was the same.
Edit2: It's called LTCPP Here is the latest I could find, It's from august and tldr nothing is known about when it will be functional, and this link is honestly worthless besides verifying that that someone had the idea for it.

Coinbase is legit. They are a new startup and have been overwhelmed recently by massive interest in their service, but they have hired, and are continuing to hire more people and get their bugs figured out. What I'm confused about is 1. Why didn't the company you purchased from just send you btc themselves when they agreed to refund you in btc (shouldn't take longer than 10 min) and 2. Coinbase and Bitpay compete in merchant processing, a company wouldn't have any reason to sign up for both services, they would pick one. Furthermore If you made a transaction through either coinbase or bitpay, to a merchant, only the service you used would be able to refund you. What you have described is like visa deciding to refunding mastercard customers (which makes it strange that you would get an email from coinbase). Do you know which service the company used when you made the purchase?

I did it by making a bunch of paper wallets on my coinbase account and retaining the private keys.  I gave the class a week to move their btc before I would suck all the wallets back up.  I got no btc back.  This way your not wasting any btc if people decide not to care after taking it.

In the words of Eric v. 
Thanks for reaching out. Now, hopefully I don't come across as rude or elitist, but I need to be honest. Litecoin is not interesting to me. It offers no significant benefit over Bitcoin whatsoever. It has a little value purely as a backup blockchain in case some critical flaw destroys Bitcoin's blockchain (assuming the same flaw doesn't affect LTC). Other then that, why should anyone care about it? Don't tell me it has "faster confirmation times"... zero-conf Bitcoin transactions work for just about everything, and for those times when security is important, waiting for the 2.5 min LTC block is only 1/4th as secure, so the "advantage" is trivial. Does that justify a $350 million market cap? Consider me skeptical.
Understand that there is huge advantage - a massive technological and societal utility - in the current world moving toward Bitcoin. There is no advantage in a Bitcoin world moving toward Litecoin. I know Litecoin fans like to say it's silver to Bitcoin's gold, and while it's a cute comparison, it doesn't really mean anything. Bitcoin's divisibility eliminates the need for a less valuable unit to partner with. In other words, the mBTC is the silver to BTC's gold.
Here's my suspicion... the only reason you are suggesting to me that Coinapult (or any business) should accept Litecoin is that there's a chance the announcement of the acceptance will drive the LTC price higher. There's no significant added utility for the company, for me, or for you, beyond that speculative interest.
Litecoin, and the other alts, are 99.9999% speculation. To be sure, much of Bitcoin's price is also due to speculation about future value, but at least this is based on a reasonable assessment of the potential of the system vs. its competition (fiat currency and the global banking network). Speculating on altcoins, in general, is pure greater fool theory in action, because there is no significant fundamental utility, no "improvement delta" over Bitcoin itself. People are going to get burned with them, and it's unfortunate because Bitcoin is seeing returns of 10,000% per year and apparently that's just not enough for some people =)
Altcoins are the penny stocks of the Bitcoin world, and perhaps their greatest virtue is that they distract the most superficial speculators away from Bitcoin itself. Should they exist? Yes. I'm glad people experiment in every way with this technology. But don't let speculative experiments at the margin distract from the most mind-blowingly awesome monetary system mankind has ever seen - Bitcoin proper.
Cheers, -Erik

You're thinking about Bitcoin's wrong. If everybody only had 3 $ worth of BTC it would be because that is all they wanted or could afford. If they want more then the price will go up as fiat value is moved into btc. They are infinitely divisible so there "supply" will never run out from people buying them up. The more likely effect of this would be a bubble. If the public stops using them they will still survive in the black market where they are used solely as a means to transfer value.

I see your point. What I'm trying to say is that there are people going around spreading the rumor we are burning 15 million dollars of electricity a day to run the network. That is based on the hashrate in terms of CPU power. They got the hashing part right, but they are overestimating the electricity used (because the network runs on asics not cpu's). Overtime you are right, the network will approach zero profitability, but I'm referring to  the current spreading of FUD.

While we are discussing FUD I would like to address 2 points I've been hearing these last couple days for anyone new here.
1. If you have heard we burn 15 million dollars a day in electricity, complete FUD. Those numbers are based on the hashrate if the network was run on GPU's instead of highly specialized ASICs that only use a fraction of the electricity of GPU's.
2. The idea that bitcoins are cheap or expensive because a bitcoin costs xx and a litecoin costs xx...... It is all your head playing tricks on you. Coins are an arbitrary measurement. Satoshi could have set it to a billion coins and it would not have changed anything. When you buy btc you are buying a portion of a fixed number of bitcoins. Look at it as a percentage of the total instead of a "coin". Move value in or out of systems as you please, but this notion of a full "coin" is completely psychological.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:34:15

In my opinion it isn't even good for that.  A ton of those wallets are gone forever and most people have multiple wallets with different balances. Then a few of the richest people are actually a ton of not so rich people.

They will be reservable soon, but only from special wallets.  Master coin and possibly similar projects will implement a "savings wallet" where transactions can be reversed within a certain amount of time.  Great for savings but merchants should not accept payment from coins that have recently come from this wallet.

@_date: 2013-11-12 17:01:05
If the price drops by half you should refund them twice the btc, If the price doubles you should refund them half the btc. 
The same potential problem exists with dollars, just the margins are tiny because dollars are relatively stable. Until bitcoin is stable enough for you to feel comfortable you should pick something else to measure value in overtime for your products. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:24:40
Bitcoin was created like almost exactly 5 years ago to the day. It would have been you and satoshi (the creator of bitcoin) mining alone. You could have made hundreds of thousands of BTC with a laptop. At that point it was just some open source software someone threw up on github.

I have been buying from coinbase with both a chase and a wells fargo account. Not had any problems, but did have wells fargo call and ask if I had initiated the transactions. But all good so far from my chase account. I'm a member of the chase "private bank", not sure if that has any effect on what they will let me get away with or not. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:13:16
There is no such thing as not enough (infinitely divisible). If the private key is lost you will have no way to recover the bitcoins. Wallet and transaction systems are being developed that can replace things like trusts and wills, and set limits and rules based on what you want. For instance multiple people that can control the same coins, or automatic transfer of bitcoins if a set of parameters are not met. Maybe if you don't sign a message every year your coins transfer to another wallet controlled by a loved one. These new idea's will take time to be built and tested.

Hey there.  I'm a Cap hill native.  I got into btc purley by chance.  I was exploring the tor hidden wiki to satisfy my own curiosity. I was interested because I saw people transacting in this currency I had never heard of. I use my coins to invest in BTC related companies, to pay of debts to interested friends, and to buy everyday things that I need. Using the Gyft app I can buy anything through CVS and Amazon which covers a great deal of the things I would be buying with USD. 
I started a new sub today [BitcoinSeattle]( to get the community talking in my city. We need interested seatleites to subscribe and contribute content.  If your into Bitcoin come on over and follow the sub!
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:35:11
I use very little fiat anymore. Granted I have less expenses then some people, but I really only spend fiat on rent and bills anymore. My favorite app is gyft. They have a ton of cards but the ones I find most useful are Amazon, Target, Whole foods, and coming soon Starbucks.
I guess what your asking is what will specific people want to use bitcoin for in russia or the uk? I think that will probably be different for each person.

While I share your sentiment and I'm very bullish on bitcoin I'm not sure I would say this just yet. For instance I always keep enough fiat to pay rent because of that small chance that bitcoin could fail. I wouldn't feel comfortable without being positive I can pay rent no matter what.

I don't think you get it either. The ceiling is ALL monetary value in the world combined, then divided by 21,000,000 and the floor is 0. And the computational power needed to create a bitcoin isn't supposed to rise over time. It is fluctuating constantly based on how much computational power is being devoted to mining. Alot of miners with alot of computational power = hard to make coins. Me mining all the coins by myself on my laptop = coins that require much less computational power. What is set to change is the number of coins being created which will slow down until 21 million coins is reached in 2140.

I originally bought it because it seemed like the 2nd best option to AM. I was looking to diversify a little an although AMC was kinda dead at that point I thought it could be worth the investment if august rolled around and their miners started to come online. This bubble was an unexpected treat. I got my initial investment out plus some and I am not putting all that BTC back in but I am increasing my holdings for the same reasons I bought it in the first place. I think it has the most potential besides AM. Either way I have my initial investment back so it's all play time at this point I suppose.

It could continue to operate on whatever electronic network remained but it would be isolated from the full network and therefore susceptible to fraud. If you have complete trust in who your dealing with I guess you could still create the transaction and have it sync up when the full network rectified

What are you talking about. If I have $10 and issue 10 colored coins worth a dollar each, I now have 10 blockchain assets backed by 10 off-blockchain assets. Colored coins are exactly the concept she is talking about. 
"can be applied to any alternative value unit (one backed by real value). This can be applied to all forms of money, but most notably to government money"
Colored coins is a way of issuing promissory notes backed by real world assets.

So in essence for the last bubble we had a strong 30$ base, now we have a strong 150$ base (or whatever specific number you want to peg it to) point is the base we are starting with is multiple times the base of the last bubble.

Wow, weird, I was just thinking about how one would make a bot to do this for their exchange last night as I was falling asleep. I came to the conclusion that I would have to make it randomly bounce slightly different amounts between a given range of valuations (maybe avg last 30 min if stable) for it to look legit.  If they are doing this, which they might or might not be, they are a little sloppy.

An account dealing in USD was frozen which in turn had an effect on the btc network.

Because bitcoin like this is not in your best interest. The smartest thing you can do with btc is hoard but use it to pay for anything you would spend money on anyway. Then you can use your fiat that you would have spent on goods to replenish the bitcoin you spent on services.   This is the smartest thing a bitcoiners can do.

Right like I said I think that reason will be different for different people. Gyft works great even if you don't have bitcoins already because you save money by using bitcoins.

It's backed in the sense that you can come to me and trade me a colored coin for a dollar.  You are free to trust whatever issuer you please and if someone lies to you you have been scammed. The same way anything else is backed in any other sense. The US gov used to back dollars with gold which meant that a paper dollar was a promissory note you could take to the bank and get gold for. Turns out people who trusted them got scammed back in 1933.

If you are really interested in investing in mining but cant afford to/don't have the technical knowledge buy ASIC MINER PT shares. They pay a dividend every wed. If the dividend is to low and youre looking for the kind of payouts mentioned by OP honestly you're best bet is probably the dice :)

So I need some help understanding how shares and assets work, what purpose multiple blockchains serve (and what are they archiving? Shares and assets?), and what the DSN system provides (is it like .bitshare or something? Can I type it in on a regular browser? Is it impervious to gov intervention?).

This is a good point. I would like to add that If you have held bitcoin for a few months most likely the price is bouncing around way above what you paid. Not that volatility is a particularly good thing for holding value, but in this instance it's worked out at least for me. If I were just getting into the game now I would feel confident in that I wouldn't lose value if I was willing to hold for 6months to a year. 
While I was typing this out I just got a call from my bank asking what I was planning on doing with the bitcoins Ive been buying from coinbase...... creepy.

totally, I just think that upvotes might be influenced by bias towards btc. For instance I would say that those numbers are low because r/libertarian is sick of getting sent bitcoin posts. Bitcoin is in a unique situation on reddit cause we basically all know about it. I would venture a guess that they are sick of xposts from bitcoin, not that they are unconcerned with financial issues. Finance is a big part of libertarianism.

It costs them less to buy the cards then they are worth. Stores give them this deal because they are essentially locking in money to be spent in certain retail outlets.

If silver goes down you still lost buying power, you might have more dollars but they are worth less.

Totally wasteful, I wonder how that could be solved. If we can find a way to get the cost/environmental impact of creating power down to almost 0 it would work, but I see bitcoins becoming much more popular before that happens. PPC is somewhat energy efficient. Then again, I bet if the whole world used bitcoin the energy consumption of mining would still be less than the resources/energy it takes to handel all of our current monetary system (Cost of production, banks, regulation, ect.) Alot of that money that goes to bankers now would end up being used in building better computers which sounds like an overall positive thing to me.

The blockchain isn't the problem. It's that we humans are starting to assume that we can quantify things that we fundamentally can't from it. The blockchain is one of the most important and awesome aspects of bitcoin. The problem is people trying to assume things about users from it that they cannot logically assume.
This is not lack of clarity but more clarity then we have ever gotten in an economic system, it's funny to agree with that statement but at this point it does still seem to create bad pr. It's amazing.

The thing about day trading bitcoins the price today is not tied to much but speculation and pumps. Bitcoin will either be worthless or worth a hell of a lot more than it is now. But you have decided to try to play the day trade game, that is fine, but the logical market evaluations that you can make educated trades based upon will be nowhere to be found.  And right now with intense new interest it seems like a very risky time to day trade as you may get left behind.

I think your right. Awareness has been raised again due to recent events (conf) but all the people that will buy BTC as a result of this exposure need to find a way to actually turn their fiat into BTC. This isn't the easiest task right now, especially after the gox thang. It will take a few days. I hope china jumps on the wagon this time around.

Why would USD coin every be trading at less than 1 dollar if they are worth 1 USD, and what are they being traded against in your scenario? Paper USD? If this was the case it would have to be in a brick and mortar exchange as you can't put paper on the internet (that's the whole reason for USD coin). In that case people would literally be handing away their money as you could just redeem the USD coin and buy more, then redeem that and buy more, ect.... why would USD coin every be valued less than USD if you can exchange the two for equal value from the issuer? What profit's are the issuer losing? They can only make profits from trading fee's or something besides the actual currency because otherwise they enter into a fractional reserve system and now they are running a ponzi scheme. 
In your scenario one is not backed by the other, they are two separate assets. We could look at paper gold vs. real gold. In that case real gold trades higher because people are worried that there is not enough gold to warrant the amount of paper gold... two different assets..... ponzi scheme. 
That gold scenario is funny to me because it is essentially just USD from 50 years ago renamed paper gold..... people are falling for the same bullshit all over again. Paper gold would be that artificial peg you speak of, and I bet the market does force it to revalue to real gold at some point. Thats what should have happened to the USD but instead the GOV made their ponzi scheme law and the whole world followed suit.

The answer is nothing. If a better technology comes along it will take over. That being said as part of the BTC community all of us would defiantly see this coming and probably be a part of it before the majority of people do.

In response to number 1, it's probably because Ive been in this community for a while but when I read that it came out as "I can't easily exchange government issued debt for money" Not trying to talk shit to you or anything, just thought it was interesting how my idea's have been changed in the last year.  
In response to number 2, I would just backup a wallet on multiple usb's then keep em safe in different places, also email a copy to your best friend and hide one in drop box, now you wont lose your wallet and it is still as secure as your password (pick a hard password)
In response to number 3, I don't really worry about this. first off, wont happen. second, if it did, just take a vacation to somewhere else and spend them. 
In response to number 4, You will learn because your interested, it will take time
In response to number 5, I think we all have had our fare share of skepticism. I get a lot of responses to my BTC talk that make me feel like a child being talked to by a condescending care giver. What's funny is that I think we are getting closer and closer to the point where the same people come back asking for advice and to be taught. Ive already had two people I know come to me asking to teach them about bitcoin. People don't trust, and at first like to dismiss that which they don't yet understand.

And here it comes, finally, today we are proud to announce the starting of mining operations in time with our roadmap.  
The last week has been extremely busy and work is still in progress to bring online the whole hashing power. 
We're currently averaging about 2 TH/s in solo mode, and expect to deploy at least 4 TH by monday 16, to reach gradually 50 TH within October.
The website will be updated this week in order to show our live hashing rate and dividends will be paid every two weeks.
More pictures of the laboratory setting where the hardware is currently deployed will be also distributed. Complete installment will be shown when our final premise will be ready. We're still considering some business aspects, including only focusing on the upcoming 65nm version for what concerns bulk chip sales. We plan to take a final decision regarding this issue during the next month.
We want to say thanks to all investors who trusted us during this long endeavor.
We will be here for about one hour to answer questions.

Yes, and it is implemented if people choose to use the new version.  This is why altcoins are ridiculous.

It is built into the code. It is meant to allow bitcoin to act as gold meaning after the hard limit is reached it will be impossible for anyone to inflate your bitcoins.  This way they don't lose value because some government needs to print off more money to finance wars and such.
