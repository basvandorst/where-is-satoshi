You assume that this has ended. What's the market cap 10 years from now? This network is designed to be profitable to mine 120 years from now.

That's all you have to compare it too. What else is there? I DCA BTC and swing trade GBTC also. I've saved $50 a week since early 2017 and there is NOTHING compared to it as far as returns in my portfolio except trading GBTC. But most can't trade! BTC is expensive to trade so I just save in BTC with no intentions of selling for at least 3 halvings. This is my first as I got in right after the last. That's all I'm suggesting is have a low time preference and use BTC to save.

You're assuming the ride is over you're assuming the Bitcoin network is going to be done at 120 billion dollars and there's nothing left. This is a Network that will be worth trillions and trillions there's no telling where this goes I've saved in Bitcoin for three years and I'm up 1000%. Every week consistently buying since $1200.  go do it for yourself do $10 a week for two years and see where you would be. Or don't I don't care. if you can't see that buying Bitcoin is a better investment than buying lottery tickets that's the whole point. That you can invest or you can wish. There is nothing in this world like Bitcoin as an investment.

Yeah tell that to ARK Investment!

Trying to convince me that BTC isn't the soundest money the world has ever known. Yup, you are! I've studied Keynesian, and Austrian Economics. Understand fractional reserve banking, QE, privately owned Federal reserve fiat printers. This is the people's one way to take the power back. You want to call it a cult. That's whatever. I've been saving in BTC for 3 years every week and I'm glad I don't waste money on the lotto. I'm up 1000% way better than a bank.

You know what! That's right! I was playing around with figures the other week and had it in my mind! Thats 6.7million! Crap! I have failed the meme! That was the monthly figure! 2.5 a week! Thanks for pointing that out! I never went back and reminded myself just made the meme because it came to my mind.

Nice post! So true!
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:18:03
Touche'... Almost
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:39:28
That's not the network. That's getting robbed. The network has never been hacked and sitting 99% of time. Better than Banks

You're assuming it's over! That's a straw man argument. It's just begun! Low time preference! Think longer than tomorrow think a decade from now.
@_date: 2019-11-02 12:58:53
Nope didn't get here till early 2017 but in up 500% ... Better than a bank account.

Tell that to Tim Draper! And all the institutional investors building on ramps for BITCOIN. Stick your head in the sand all you want. One day you will have regrets.
@_date: 2019-11-04 01:14:02
All I did was post a meme suggesting that Bitcoin is a better investment than buying lotto tickets. Not to mention I suggested $10 a week over the course of the next decade a whole $4,200 the cost of a family vacation. Most people spend that on alcohol a year. No one is saying it's not flawed or it's perfect I'm saying it's the best shot we have at an actual transparent store value that we can audit. No one saying put your life savings into BITCOIN all at once and go all in I'm saying as a Savings Network it's been a pretty good Savings Network that is outside the traditional confiscatible ways.

 just going back to the furthest date. Why's that stupid? Making you think 9 years into the future! You think that it's over and it's just begun. 120 billion! This networks worth trillions.
@_date: 2019-11-02 10:07:35
So stating facts is now considered dumb? 
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:21:00
I love how suggesting people save is braindead.
@_date: 2019-11-02 02:08:47
That's what you're doing. You're saying you can only do this if you got in in 2009. I and many others would staunchly disagree. BITCOIN is not going anywhere. That's a fact. It's like saying the internet isn't going to be here back in 1990. It's ludicrous. You can be a pessimist and a skeptic all you want but the fact remains. Bitcoin is unstoppable thus far. The network is unhackable. it doesn't have to scale as a payment Network in my opinion all we need is a deflationary digital store value that's transferable in a censorship resistant fashion we already have fast payments we don't have sound money before BITCOIN. Not to mention Bitcoin is what digital money should be named and nothing will ever take that I don't care what kind of speed smart contract etc. There's no dethroning BITCOIN. I proved DCA still works today. In 2017 I I was trying to talk my family into getting into Bitcoin and I put $50 a week in BTC. No matter the price. I'm up 500% in 3 years in my BTC savings account. People are losing faith in Government backed Fiat. The writing's on the wall.

If you wanna mine mine! If you wanna trade trade! If you don't DCA.

The only people that have lost anything are gamblers who leverage trade, altcoin gamblers, and people who bought from 14k to 20k. That's a 2 month span! Other than that HODLers have all made way more than anything on the market by leaps and bounds.
@_date: 2019-12-04 10:30:50
You wouldn't buy it at 2.5 k if you want Buy It now.
