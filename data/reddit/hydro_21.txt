No, however I will try them as I thought this was a shitty rewards site where you download things and get a "reward"
I'll go download some now
Edit: I was correct. They are basically all gambling games and the other ones you just watch adverts :/

Electrum is a great wallet to use. 
If you are really serious about bitcoin then get a hardware wallet like a nano ledger s
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:25:10
Not more secure than a desktop wallet.
edit: there was an article about this on coindesk where a study found 80% of bitcoin/crypto related to apps were insecure.

@_date: 2017-12-05 11:28:41
Do not use a wallet on a smartphone. They are generally insecure.
