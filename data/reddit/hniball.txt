central europe here, can connect without a problem. question I have, is it quite common for sellers/manufactures on 1688 to dropship stuff or use express shipping like dhl or something similar? so you dont have to wait weeks for an order, instead it takes more like 2-5 days.

wake me up when it hits 10€, I may throw some € in and risk it.. Imho still a huge risk buying a single coin at 80€, I am not sure that I would ever see either the coin or my € back :D
Yeah, Gox dun goofed that much for me..
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:21:17
yes please, you need to give 0.1 BTC each to a thousand people in total. so we know you are in possession of 100BTC, that will prove that your story is legit, OP. no brainer. if you read the post, you would know that OP gave the whole sum back.

should have waited a few months and everything would be ok.. seems to work with other scamming exchanges.. few months passes and everyone forgets that someone robbed them blind and or they realize nothing can be done about it and just accept their fate. happened to me with weexchange.

If they see their money sooner than I and other people that got fucked in the ass by Jon Mo(ro)ntroll from weexchange, Im gonna be really mad :/ Im waiting since October.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:11:16
yeah, that is a fool proof solution for sure, but how is this supposed to work for the common guy? the regular person that doesnt want to go through all this hassle to pay for a single item online? where he either doesnt have the means to facilitate this or simply doesnt know how and doesnt care to learn this, because it is difficult for him. I just cannot seem to figure out how are this cryptocurrencies gonna work on a bigger/greater scale.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:37:03

how are people supposed to use bitcoin as a currency if everyone used cold storage? well fuck, that is not very practical for a currency, is it? :D

just say it wasnt vircurex.com, im holding some bitcoins in trade orders there for a while, would like to know if i should just end that up right now and witdhraw back to my cold wallet :D
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:22:52
wow, fuck this shit.. after what happened with weexchange im scared to exchange my bitcoins for fiat.. im keeping everything in hot wallets and cold storage. i already lost 10BTC thanks to weexchange.. guess i am waiting for the adoption to spread and spend the coins on something i really want, ok lol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:40:24

@_date: 2014-02-04 19:19:00
well.. its either all or nothing for me.. i will wait till one coin is not worth at least 4k :) but more like 10k, we will see.. if it will all fall, so be it.. i will lose 50k.. that wont impede my life significantly.. i did not invest 50k into bitcoin to begin with, i bought them for like 70 bucks each.. but i can gain much more if this all turns good "as promised".  where i live, i have 40 years till my retirement.. i projected that if I would be employed all those 40 years not missing a single month and if I earned avarage salary (both impossible feats), i would earn up to 470k USD.. i will try my luck with btc :)

your last line, that may be.. but i just cannot see a "joke" meme currency overtake the banks.. or at least internet payments.. its all too silly.. good for kids/teens, fun to use.. but i cannot imagine some adults using this on regular basis. you know there are not only 12 yo on internet :/ such woof, many send.. really? you have traded all your btc for doge? good for you on the short term basis.. i did too, not all.. but i did and i made a very nice profit. but i will hold btc longterm over any other altcoin.. the best dev team is behind it.. solving issues that are present.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:45:26
in that case, why fucking keep in on an exchange for the longest time?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:13:18
I hold everything in cold storage, I am one lazy fuck that cant be bothered to import the private keys if I wanted to sell during the crash, looks like there are lot of people like that around.. also others that used bitcoins to invest in other altcoins, they wont cash that out too... we will never experience a massive crash from now on.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:09:21
Good nose, better stay away.. They are associated with scammer Jon Montroll that stole millions in BTC from Weexchange. I saw photos of all of their smug faces with big smiles a while ago on bitcointalk, had the strongest feeling to punch someone.

i still dont understand.. bitcoin core maintainer? like.. he can change/update the code or what? correct mistakes? i thought once it is in place, its for good and no one can stop it or modificate it? if he can change the code.. how? why cant anyone change it? what is needed?

//they wont shut you down though, probably.. you never mention BTC anywhere in your listings, just the banner you put there.. i learned that they use some sort of parser/automatic filter that checks for words like "crypto", "bitcoin", "btc" and they end those listings right away (probably a human goes through them first)

what about all those websites that generate bitcoin address? is it safe to use? are you able to derive the private key there? if so, what is the point of moving your mouse around for a bit to increase the entropy? i am just asking because i hold all my coins on addresses that I generated via javascript on an offline computer, you know.. all those paper wallet generator sites and you can download their code. and I am now worried a bit.
//also dont know if that matters, but i generated my addresses back in 2012 using bitaddress.org.. if someone knows about some issues there, i would appreciate your input.

@_date: 2015-01-28 10:29:39
Good for you, but try November 2013, they were still selling for 1BTC
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:08:39
they were still selling trezor for 1BTC when the price was $500-$600. so, yeah.. im gonna support a cheap knockoff here if it is the same thing under the hood.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:40:25
Sorry, Im bad with math and I also thought thats a bit more in euros. 7 lifetimes then..? those $1250 per year would only be good for housing/rent, I would still need at least food :) 7 lifetimes to just get by, 5 lifetimes to live pretty comfortably. Even with $1250 per year, I would still have a permanent roof above my head and I would be warm. If I wanted more from life, lets say I would work a little.

@_date: 2017-03-24 20:29:10
the price drop is because bitcoin cant be used in day to day life for paying stuff anymore. high fees, long confirmation. and no one wants to simply increase blocksize, which would solve these issues right away.

well you just freaked me out now.. "bad address"? I used an online javascript site to generate my cold storage addresses like.. 4 or 5 years ago.. funds are still there. should I be worried? Are there some known bitcoin address generator sites that had bugs in them?
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:05:14
and whats so bad about miners deciding the block size?
better than 0.1% of the select few controlling everything
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:30:18
it already is going on for what 2-3 years and they solved nothing, so its more sad, than funny :)
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:28:39
a lot of people are buying ETH with fiat.. but yeah, I guess most of the trade is BTC for ETH because of a sinking ship. if blocksize gets resolved, I bet most of those investments go back to BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:00:24

Okay, mr. true believer, serious question time now. you believe in bitcoin. what exactly are the "unique properties and unfathomable potential as a medium of transfer." that no other "altcoin" has on offer right now? like now. today. tell me only one. the unique 10 hours wait time for my transaction to confirm? that is something to boast about? or the excessive transaction fees? if that is your look on things, then i guess bitcoin is really unique :)

hey OP, nice propaganga post to dissent other users from investing into altcoin and persuade them to just keep investing into BTC. how much did they pay you for this shit?
you said you bought antshares for 20BTC, why not include that part in your chart to show us how much you made on this trade? or did you manage to sell that right away?
there was actually a post yesterday about a guy that invested his first paycheck into antshares half a year ago that now has a million. good think that guy didnt keep it in BTC, because he wouldnt even have 10k in BTC today, right?
or maybe you are just that stupid that 100% of your altcoin investments into dozens of different coins tanked? I dont think so.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:16:45
that is exactly what it is. and that is why btc cash was created.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:50:26
or could have just put them into NEO and have 50 times more BTC today. this post stinks of constructed propaganda to dissent others from investing into altoins. would be nothing new for this stinky sub. he even mentioned he invested 20BTC in NEO and what, cashed out? he would have like 1000BTC today if he didnt do anything. he only cashed out those coins that went up 20-30% in a week and continued to be invested in those that were steadily dropping? I dont think so.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:29:01
only time will tell if you did a stupid thing or not. maybe you will have a "fuck me" moment once you sell again half a year from now, when bitcoin sits at 5k and NEO on 200USD
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:28:30
BU wants to just upgrade blocksize and they dont want to add anything different or new on top of bitcoin.
segwit wants to implement numerous number of new things into bitcoin which are unnecessary, complicated and pointless and on top of that, they want you to place your trust into some third party companies. because bitcoin is a decentralized and trustless protocol, right? makes sense.
this once [pic]( describes segwit perfectly 
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:39:34
well if you sent 10 transactions, thats really bad.
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:21:20

@_date: 2017-04-30 19:47:43
dogecoin ATH past week? you mean when it was selling for 40 satoshis? i remember a time when I was selling doge for 120 satoshis in 2013. not long after that bitcoin hit 900USD
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:29:27
nope, they dont work. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:14:18
if iit was only about blocksize increase, then maybe he would ;)
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:25:53
nope mister, you are misinformed. segwit effectively boots all the non-upgraded nodes off the network due to them no longer being able to fully verify the blockchain! You can't verify segwit data if you don't know about segwit data. core says this is by design of course. So you are no longer running a fully validating node after segwit.
segwit is hard fork disguised as soft work, open your eyes.
it just excludes the nodes from the network not running the completely different protocol while fooling them into thinking everything is OK
this is what "compatible" means to core, excluding the bitcoin network that has existed for 7 years and completely changes ledger format into separate entities with new attack vectors AND completely changes the economics of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:41:32
whats the point of lightning the way it is really? you would want to use lightning on small transactions where you need quick confirmation. buying stuff in shops. so I pay 5 bucks to open lightning channel for my 5 dollar coffee? no thanks.
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:51:17
yeah, bitcoin is sure good at keeping censorship resistance.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:35:55
and I guess the side that wants you to put your trust into some 3rd party company which is pointless and quite dangerous when I just want to send my money with low fees and quickly is the one that really knows what they are talking about?
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:45:58
but sweeping an address costs a transaction fee and then another fee to send the funds to an exchange? with import, I just then have to send to funds to the exchange? so its easier that way?
@_date: 2017-04-30 05:38:34
thanks, also when i am using import instead of sweeping, it shouldnt really matter in this scenario, as I dont care about the backup seed, because i will not be using the address again once spent? whats more, if i am using import private key function instead of sweeping and not spending total balance, it still should notmatter that the wallet wont have a backup available as long as I have the private key written somewhere, I can still access the address in the future, maby even using a different software wallet, am I understanding this correctly?
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:38:14
its not like whats written in your post is not true :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:36:24
dont know why people call segwit a soft fork if its obviously also hard fork. it was proven that old software wont accept new blocks as valid and you still have to upgrade, else you cant use segwit. but yes, i forgot, "this is by design" so how is this different from BU hard fork?
also, dont know about you, but 1MB is not enough now, you think 1.7MB limit will be enough forever? with segwit, it looks like it will have to be ;) not a great solution.
//also 1.7MB isnt approximately 2MB
@_date: 2017-04-30 19:39:52
dude, if it acts like a bitcoin transaction wise, people dont give two shits what was the real intended purpose.
it being a "gas" option too is just icing on the cake.

another thing.. why should I pay some 3rd party money to open a channel when I want to send my coins somewhere and then pay again to close that channel? im paying miners to send my transactions through the network. fuck this evil LN crap. if this gets implemented, bitcoin will be good only as a store of value and nothing else. I dont want to pay five bucks to buy something with bitcoin that costs 10 bucks and then pay additional five bucks to close the channel. you dont see how fucked this whole thing is? people that want segwit are either people that want to cash out on their bitcoin investments or  people that directly profit from segwit and they dont care about anything else.

yeah, i kinda did. i just dont understand why after all this time their site is still on and going :?
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:33:41
i dont think that is a fair analogy. imagine if that guy was just a simple guy that liked cars and wasnt in any way associated with ford? bitcoin is decentralized. bitcoin is trustless. there is no president. no one sits on top.
for some reason, a bunch of people just think they can control something that wasnt meant to be controlled. 
and that bunch of people is core/blockstream
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:14:07
yep, answer us one question, what happens when segwit is activated and we are at a stage again when every block is full? what then? guess you and all the others that support segwit dont give a fuck about that.
//whats even sadder, segwit isnt even a 100% blocksize increase, more like 70%, what a joke.
@_date: 2017-04-08 05:16:28
you want proof why segwit is essentially HF, read this article.. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:03:10
why is it malicious? he is educating people. what is most important, he is telling the truth that you obviously cant handle someone shitting on your precious protocoin. 
why wouldnt you support something that you like? its not like bitcoin is his god.. he can support and invest in anything he damn well likes.. what is it to you or other core members and bitcoin fanatics? i like chocolate. that doesnt mean i will always go for the same brand if there are so many interesting kinds on offer.
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:52:46
lets be honest here, if there was a popular platform that would offer the buyers to pay their sellers in bitcoin beforehand right into the sellers wallet, wouldnt there be a ton of scammers that simply would not ship the bought items? if there was a middle man that would hold the bitcoin for a certain amount of time (like e-scrow), it would not be a decentralized system and in what would it be different from paypal at this point?
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:43:26
not true about the part saying "paypal and nothing else", you ever tried to sell a car or a motorcycle on ebay? you are not even able to list paypal as a default payment option. you are able to use personal checks, wire transfers and several other payment methods. you can also pay in person when picking up the item. its a matter of simple agreement between seller and buyer (better have that agreement on paper or in a private message on ebay at the very least). why should they care, the important thing for them is that the seller pays them the 10% cut once the sale happens. which can also be paid by credit/debit card or a check. granted, yeah.. they made like 2-2.5% less because of the nonexistent paypal fees in such a case, but 10% is better than 0%.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:12:44
what if I told you the bubble was the end? what is this shit? you come from the future?
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:21:24
how are they going to do that, if it takes hours to confirm transaction? I just spent 80min waiting for 3 confirmations yesterday. that is the least amount of confirmations I saw as a requirements when sending transactions. would be nice to lower the limit to 1 or even zero.
@_date: 2017-05-15 07:54:23
hardware wallet is an expensive and franky pointless solution if you just want to store the coins long term as an investment. just use a paper wallet. as long as you are the only one having access to the private key, you can recover the coins any time you want. no need for wallet passwords, seeds, etc..
this is the bitcoin security at its most fundamental form. no need for anything additional. if someone guesses your private key, then the whole bitcoin protocol is pointless and worthless.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:04:27
yeah, with bitcoin doing about 300k transactions on current blocksize limit per day and another 250k unconfirmed and rising and segwit not even doubling that blocksize, im sure it will buy us plenty of time, lol.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:09:41
i remember when it was at 15$ and I bought 10, because I wanted to buy some stuff on darknet. not long after that it was 40$ and then 70$, never bought anything on darknet again with them. except a seller membership on one market for 1BTC, damn.. I never used the account for selling too.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:11:07
lol, why do you care if the chain splits? you follow the one you are comfortable with and thats about it. if you truly believe that your side is the right one, i dont see why you would care about the "minority chain". look at ethereum, they have two chains and are doing fine..
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:45:58
yeah, if WWIII breaks out nowadays, Im sure most of the world is going to still use internet the way they use it now and that they will be mining bitcoin, lol. hilarious reading comments in this sub.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:42:30
lol, so the purpose of bitcoin is only a store of value now? ok.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:16:00
well for starters there will ever be only 21 million coins in existance and estimates are that maybe even more than a million is already lost, so right now you have 15mil coins in circulation, so I guess its at least something rare that not everyone will own and that makes it valueable
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:05:37
I guess you sold a week ago, right? ;D
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:49:44
you might have a chance to do that again soon :) but lets be honest, even if it goes down to around 1000, you still wont buy and when it recovers, it will be the same discussion all over again
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:23:20
even people that are using bitcoin only as a store of value are worried and care about fundamentals that directly affect the inner workings/system of the economy in the same way that stock investors care about the death of a CEO, because those things directly affect price. no one here would argue with you when you tell that if blocksize was increased a long time ago, we would see higher prices right now. 
though I do agree with you that even if such a black swan event would arise, some fundamental bug/mistake in the code, it would still take a long time for the currency to loose its value, people would speculate even then..
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:31:16
some major things would have to change before that.. those things didnt change in the past two years, you think we will see a change soon? nah..
@_date: 2017-05-03 06:13:24
you used the appropriate (higher) transaction fee, which is not always  feasible. if you are sending 1k and paying 70 cents? ok.. buy if you are sending 5 bucks and paying 70 cents? I dont think so. also there is a set number of transactions that can be executed in a single day because of the 1MB blocksize limit. if a lot of people want to transact at once, those that are last are just shit out of luck getting their transactions sent.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:33:57
i used electrum and set the fee to highest possible amount available and wasnt, so its not that hard, but people are expected to go out of their way to achieve it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:16:57
first of all, it needs to be usable again. no transaction backlog/filled mempool at all. blocksize needs to increase. but I dont think we will eve reach that amount.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:13:37
not sure if your post was pro core or against :D
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:22:39
what do you consider a common payment to be? like debit/credit card or cash? well then I have a surprise for you, no one in retail/online store will wait hour for a confirmation on your bitcoin payment.

@_date: 2017-05-02 19:29:39

Seems like the biggest mistake I made in life so far was selling [this]( for 71.83 EUR per coin (yeah, i wont forget those numbers, haha). I bought 2000 EUR worth of bitcoins and sold them for ~2800 EUR, PROFIT!
I know it does not seem that much for some people, ~30000 EUR (current price),  but i make that much in 6 years :D 
some of the coins (like 15?) I bought when one was worth 10€ and kinda left it at that for a while, later saw the boom around the currency and bought additional coins.. I could not even fathom back then have I was able to justify spending 110 EUR on a single coin, it is possible i would not ever do that again if I had the chance. 
I held it all during the april crash, I think i had a little heart attack back then, later during the second or third "crash" I pussied out and sold everything :/ 
Seems like those bitcoin spartans had it right all along, "HOLD HOLD HOLD", I should have listened a little while longer.
also retrospectively the most expensive thing i ever bought online (except bitcoins) was 1BTC fee membership on some market where I wanted to become a seller to sell some handy ebooks, never got to it, never even listed a single item :D i think i dont even remember the credentials I used for the registration..
oh boy, i know these things will haunt me even more with the upcomming years.. i already had some sleepless nights

hey.. its always a gamble investing into mining contracts/companies.. they never deliver on time, for one.. except maybe asicminer. i invested into few mining companies, because i saw how many of them rose by 1000-2000% since IPO, so what can go wrong, right? exactly those companies that i chose went down badly and i lost about 90% of my investment. oh well.. also only holding now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:34:06
sure, every person that was scammed dealing with bitcoins was just some idiot stupid kid. otherwise they would have known better. uh, have you ever been scammed? i guess not, because you are not some idiot. either you dont use your coins, they are just sitting securely on the blockchain, or you were just lucky.. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:10:25
would it be suspicious if i suddently started sending fiat to some account in US? if i made a deal with some person.. would they ask him about where is the money from? i am only asking because i also dont have to tax my bitcoins that i converted into fiat and basically no one gives a fuck here about where i send my fiat either.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:38:01
hmm, interesting.. why though :D i guess i wont sleep tonight
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:13:06
well they had one of the highest trust ratings/OTC Ratings and were very well regarded in the bitcoin community. but as i said, even the guy that had the highest OTC rating amongst bitcoiners turned out to be a scammer and one of the most trusted people on bitcointalk that created some wallet service or whatever it was turned out to be one too :) so.. if you cannot trust those, yeah.. its only you I guess. 
and based on this, i must say that people that will leave tens of thousands of bitcoins in the hands of one individual have balls of steel. look at just-dice.. how much did they hold at one point in time? 100k of bitcoins? one person is behind that site and do we even know something else besides his nickname? not to accuse dooglus of anything..

woohoo, glad all my coins are tied in weexchange, not like i wanted to spend some on black friday :/
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:59:26
i was not talking specifically about sites like bitstamp and gox, as those are the biggest exchanges out there.. we know people behind those sites, they have physical locations, headquarters and dozens and maybe hundreds of people working for them. and there would be great repercussions if some person behind those sites decided to ran off with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-27 13:46:45
is he butthurt that he missed the train? or gambled away his coins on just-dice? maybe bad investment in securities? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:21:53
precisely.. and quantum computing is on the way.. they already ran a quantum computer successfully for about 40 minutes, so I do not understand why people see bitcoin as the one thing that will replace fiat currency. wouldnt mind an explanation for this.

tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of bitcoins were stolen.. which is quite the number considering there is a finite amount of coins.. your point? at least banks can block those cards and start some counter action, like reversing those transactions, that is not the case with bitcoins.

what most of you "fanatics" dont get is.. its not even instantaneous, stop calling it that.. it kinda gets on my nerves, because its not true and im seeing it for these past two years brought up as the biggest plus. you have to wait for the confirmation and that takes time.. without delay? no.. you cant instantly use those money without a delay, there is a delay.
@_date: 2013-12-14 08:46:10
i personally dont think cryptocurrencies will "rule the world", it is just  a fad that will blow off after few years. sorry if my post above gave another impression. early adopters will profit greatly and it will still have its steady place in some corner of the internet and *maybe* a physical world, but nothing really huge.. i think people are just blinded by this boom right now and are thinking too much of it. seeing it as the "cure for all diseases" when in reality, people are just hopeless and clinging after universal solution to all their problems and they for some reason chose this, because someone told them one coin will be worth million.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:44:25
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:24:15
yes, because every service dealing with bitcoins allows you to use outsite escrow. noe one even uses that integrated bitcoin feature that behaves like an escrow. they have their own escrow system and most of them dont havy any..you just send them your coins and hope everything is good. if people would only use services that allow the use of escrow, there would be almost no adoption here.

i have to know.. why was it always 324 BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:51:18

bitcoiners are butthurt that doge is rising faster than bitcoin itself when it began, nothing more to it.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:40:36
wow... thanks? 
though.. riddle me this, mr. bot! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:39:20
ya hear that, people? apparently every website operator out there has eidetic memory
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:58:42
not that it matters really, but [here]( is a better quality video
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:48:57
soo... what if i want to spend my coins online? or is that not the point of a digital currency?
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:04:35
he is camera shy.. told me via PM
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:00:30
i told him the same, except i adeed that if he planned to continue after all, he should rather give 1000 BTC to me than to the house, oh well.. :/ :D
but to be fair, the game changed quite a bit since he won those 11k
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:00:42
so basically this guy from thailand was no one in 2011 and then started mining and mined a couple thousand btc? :) now he has a lambo and his own farm? that is rad.
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:14:20
it is crash only for those that bought on top :]
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:14:45
if there are no laws regarding bitcoin, why did he give them those coins? were they threatening him?
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:58:23
I hope so! everything I had was tied there. thank you for the info.
@_date: 2013-12-08 12:14:53
his name is clearly Albert, that is sufficient enough proof!
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:24:42
Uhmm, yes indeed. change Bitcoin for Litecoin/Feathercoin/Sexcoin/Dogecoin/etc.. and it still all applies. why bitcoin? *wink wink*
Dogecoin to the moon, bitcoin is so 2013.. anyone can create a currency, my point is, this wont hold.

Thanks for the boost :) :) I know, its just that thinking I had a private key to [this]( not too long ago.. seeing the number $ 37,410.63 there now, it is kinda.. unsettling for me, ha :) if it was ten years from now with this price difference, im sure i would get over it much more easily
