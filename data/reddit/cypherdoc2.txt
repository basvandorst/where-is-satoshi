From bip 141:
The new rule is total block cost ≤ 4,000,000.
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:54:58
i think it comes down to a question of magnitude once LN grows big.  
let's say i'm a big blocker as well as early adopter with lotsa coins accumulated cheaply.  i don't like LN.  let's say i wait 5y for LN to get big with $100B worth of value riding on it.  onchain tx's continue stuck where they are at 1MB worth of tx's (~2000) with the express purpose of becoming a settlement layer.  the relative values of the 2 layers becomes significantly  inverted.  i then launch a spam attack that lasts 3mo.  how many ppl riding LN payment channels get killed in that scenario and how many dollars get wiped out due to the time dependent nature of closing these tx's?  in that sense, all these open payment channels can be considered in aggregate a huge 0 conf tx.
the problem as i see it is that there is a desire coming from some parts of the community to want to have continuous and relatively full blocks at all times, ie limited capacity, to drive up fees and drive a desire for LN tx's.  well sure, you can do that but do you really then want to build a huge multi billion dollar LN on top of such a constrained low capacity system?  a determined attacker can easily clog up mempools and he has a huge monetary incentive to do so.  just the chaos caused by the volatility of an attacker jumping in and out of successive spamming attacks will be destructive.
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:06:55


doesn't the timelocked tx need to close at or near that time or forever be lost?
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:17:58


is it not given to them at all or is it given and the old node just ignores the witness data?
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:31:24
if a+b&lt;=4MB, i might be convinced.
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:33:45
at this far advanced portion of the blocksize/scaling debate, a HF will be perfectly safe as everybody and their mother has heard about this.  your mother will probably upgrade before you do once she gets the news :)


no, core dev is taking more liberties in executing SF's.  these ANYONECANSPEND tx's are a new phenomena that forcibly degrades old nodes to SPV security.  p2sh wasn't controversial b/c everyone wanted MS's.  today is a different time and political climate.  it's quite possible you'll only get the 25% of full nodes Satoshi 0.12 clients to do the SW upgrade leaving 75% that disagrees or are too lazy.  that's a recipe for problems, imo, even if you get 95% miner approval.
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:33:50


so your solution is to rely on SWSF instead?  how is that guaranteed?  esp when it requires &gt;2000 LOC, giving a centrally planned  75% discount to LN multisigs (p2sh), opening up the formally restrictive script versioning system that guarantees security (proven over last 7y) to "all sorts of changes" quoting Lombrozzo &amp; Todd that could also change Bitcoin economics (by importing Ethereum and god knows what else via endless SF's).  like the potential for 29 simultaneous new op_code SF's being proposed in parallel, all of which are guaranteed to confuse miners.  not to mention forcibly downgrading all old nodes to SPV level verification creating the potential for network partitioning if only the current 23% of Satoshi 0.12 nodes actually upgrade.  and for what?  a measly 1.75MB increase in blocksize at most on average?  what you are working towards is a solution that requires unrealistic economic expectations that being your perceived demand for micropayment channels that require ppl to lock up money and require time dependent closure that could be gamed by spam attacks.  None of those things are guaranteed. So we should not rely on them.
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:34:29
do they have to receive the witness?  
@_date: 2016-04-14 15:06:45


no.  the discount really doesn't come from the libsecp speedups.  read here my simple explanation as to the SW math:
and, if you don't believe me, here's the more involved complicated explanation from all respected AJTowns with my explanations as to the effects:
this is also why when questioned in HK about his choice of 4MB, imo, he didn't want to have to say that *suddenly* core dev had decided that 4MB could indeed be handled (centrally planned) by the network vs. the forever touted 1MB maximum.
@_date: 2016-04-10 01:23:13
is Bitcore just a repurposed Bitcoin Core?  a full node?
@_date: 2016-04-03 03:46:36
old nodes won't relay any of these &gt;1MB SW blocks, will they?
@_date: 2016-04-09 11:56:02
Why is this a surprise? Segnet is for testing after all. It wasn't an economically driven block size increase. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:31:05


does it fix the problem?  you still have to have a sigops accounting limit to stop a regular mega-tx from getting thru since not all tx's will be SW.
@_date: 2016-04-04 17:25:13


can you clarify your statement b/c it seems to conflict with this from sipa on irc:
&lt;sipa&gt; you can have a transaction that spends from a segwit output and moves to a normal one or the other way around
@_date: 2016-04-03 02:48:49
HTLC tx's are only used once inside the channel, correct?  the multisigs required to open and close the channel are in fact larger than regular tx's and are what is subject to the discount, no?
@_date: 2016-04-14 14:56:27


that would be ok if there wasn't a mandatory 75% discount given to LN tx's just b/c they're complex multisigs.  but there is.  the flip side way of saying that is that SW forces regular tx users to pay 4x what the going rate will be for LN tx's.  that's not fair.  make the formula a+b&lt;=4MB and i might consider it.


why don't you tell all the ppl like me what you've determined to be the "appropriate fee"?


uh really?  it isn't over yet if you hadn't noticed.
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:16:43
well, that's the thing.  this is a new strategy being conducted for SF's beginning last week with BIP68 it appears.  no one argued with p2sh b/c everyone liked the idea of multisig tx's.  SWSF is very different and there is a likelihood that only 25% current Satoshi 0.12 nodes will be the one's who upgrade to SW.  this leaves a whopping 75% nodes who won't.  my fear is that we don't know the outcome of such a scenario.
btw, if old nodes are forced to relay &gt;1MB SW blocks, how are those extra BW costs fair?
@_date: 2016-04-15 15:13:31


whether you want to believe it or not, it is a discount for LN multisigs.  i've explained clearly the math.  as has AJTowns:


interesting how you personalize it, like there's something "crooked" about current Bitcoin and how Satoshi designed it.


explain technically how this is and give an example.


you keep ignoring the fact that owners of full node clients have a say in this too.  by allowing a 2MB HF, you give them a choice whether to follow core dev OR NOT.  owners should have that choice of determining whether or not they disagree with any new policies core dev is trying to introduce to the communities network.  note:  this is not core dev's network.  they don't own it.  a SF bypasses that choice by tricking old nodes into having to follow along.  their only choice then is to leave Bitcoin altogether if they don't agree.  which is no choice at all.
@_date: 2016-04-03 16:15:35
whether you are willing to admit this is a subsidy to multisigs or not, the fact of the matter it is. unless you're willing to contradict one of SW's 3 authors:
also here's the math from AJTowns where i show exactly how SW multisigs are unfairly benefitting from the 75% discount:
btw, there is no use case for consolidating UTXO's by ordinary users, so a discount won't help this much.
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:39:14
and old nodes won't relay SW tx's b/c they are non-std even though valid, correct?
@_date: 2016-04-13 03:59:41


assuming only 23% of the full nodes today convert to SW (Satoshi 0.12 clients) that means 77% of full nodes will become "old" and thus not validate nor relay any SW tx's.  that's an epic fail.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:00:06
sounds good esp in light of NSA's deprecation of ECDSA.
@_date: 2016-04-03 05:24:06
hmm, this is interesting:
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:33:27
that's useful but the discount appears to be more to encourage/subsidize usage of LN multisigs.  this has been stated many times by pwuille and Johnson Lau.
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:02:06
@_date: 2016-04-03 03:56:32


not all SF "upgrades" are considered equal.  in fact, this SWSF "upgrade" comes at much greater cost to old nodes than previous SF's; the downgraded security level to SPV status that mentioned.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:43:27


wow, you sound so certain.  even in the face of pruning, IBLT, weak/thin blocks, and future networking improvements.
@_date: 2016-04-09 00:56:45
i agree with that.
i'm thinking more of an adversial scenario though, like a purposeful spam attack on the mainchain to prevent closure of payment channels during the critical time period required to close out the channel.
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:59:04
can you answer my question above?
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:49:07
are you sure about that?  this answer by Luke seems to contradict that:
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:53:48


so what's your contingent plan when your closing tx doesn't have enough fee like during a spam attack to make it worthwhile to close the channel?
@_date: 2016-04-04 17:14:48


that's not accurate is it?  there is a 4MB blocksize limit that can traverse the network.
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:34:08
and old nodes certainly won't relay SW tx's.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:52:48
you know very well core dev is insecure about their economic assumptions regarding all offchain soluntions.  how many times have you heard one or another of them use the argument against blocksize increase that goes something like this, "if we let the mainchain scale, then what incentive do we have to develop offchain solutions?"  well duh, tell me again why that would be a bad thing?  oh yeah, devs gotta dev.
@_date: 2016-04-03 03:59:22
no, i think the new ANYONECANSPEND tx's WON'T be relayed b/c they are considered non standard even though considered valid.  weird, i know.  but my Q above refers to blocks, not tx's.
@_date: 2016-04-09 04:42:47


how does this work technically?
@_date: 2016-04-03 04:01:09
will old nodes relay SW tx's?
@_date: 2016-04-10 16:51:08
very interesting perspective.  this stimulated me to study up more on p2sh.  i can see what you're saying.  thanks for this.
@_date: 2016-04-03 05:15:51
the arguments you've been reading are comparing *onchain* bitcoin tx's; regular vs multisigs.  multisigs are obviously more signature heavy and larger than regular tx's.  and these are what are required to open and close LN pmt channels and what are being given the unfair 75% discount.  HTLC's only occur once inside the channel and are irrelevant to the argument.
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:10:22


and hence the need for the arbitrary 75% "discount" to pare total blocksize down from 4MB to 1MB.
@_date: 2016-04-09 01:18:46
i worry b/c the whole premise of the fee mkt pressure is to push tx's offchain to cheaper LN tx's.  but this fee pressure depends on relatively full blocks.  i think it's now quite clear that since last July when the spam attacks first started, that clogging up the mempools with spam is much easier the more full blocks are.  the delays have been significant and have been cheap.  a determined attacker with lots of cheap coins could clog up the network for longer periods of time than we've seen to date.  his motivation could be quite a bit higher than today if there happens to be significant amounts of value locked up in LN payment channels, say in the billions of dollars worth.  i don't see how you can predict that.
@_date: 2016-04-10 03:02:21
any detailed write ups on how to do this?
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:31:43


if old nodes can't validate SW tx's, they aren't full nodes.
@_date: 2016-04-04 17:56:30

@_date: 2015-12-13 15:42:53
How does this logic not apply to Blockstream? Especially when they sit at a critical nexus deep within Bitcoin's infrastructure? In fact, this is why it's called Core. 
Yesterday, somebody made a great argument that because of this controversy with blocksize, everybody who's anybody in the space has had to come forward to express their opinion on the matter. That isn't really a great thing if you're into privacy. How hard is it to imagine exerting pressure onto Core through Blockstream. It's investors have a long and storied history of capitulating to gvt surreptitious cooperation. 
And before anyone says they are only 9 amongst dozens, we all know how central those 9 are to decision making. I'm sure it's not something they would want to do but something they would be forced to do. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:21:35


then we should be fine with lifting the limit.  the miners will learn to defend their blocksizes by determining the proper level of spam filtering (already being done by KNC, etc) and setting the proper minfee, both to ensure profitable mining.  they are the only ones capable of determining that, not core dev thru blocksize limits.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:32:37
Lol, I don't understand that mining need to be decentralized? What a straw man. 
You, otoh, seem to think everything is just fine with over 51%of the mining in China alone, Bitcoin only bring used by a small niche of geeks and VC's in that same US that you're fearing , and with a few thousand nodes. 
And to top it off, you guys think that with bigger blocks from a higher limit is somehow a huge problem implying failure instead of success.

@_date: 2015-12-26 17:30:33
if that's the case, you have to explain why miners never mined 1MB blocks back when the avg block size was 250kB.
you ignore the fact that Bitcoin's value would be destroyed if a miner decided to attack like this destroying not only the value of his coin but of his hardware.  also, a state driven attacker would have to accumulate significant hardware to self mine a non std tx exablock like this which would take resources and manpower.  also, you ignore the ability of the network  to react to this kind of one off attack by either orphaning the block or refusing to build off it.

but that won't happen when assets need to frequently be traded via tx's.  you just said it yourself, the incentive for miners to mine tx's is for the fees esp in the future when rewards go away; greater usage of BTC via asset trading will drive up tx numbers and thus tx fees, all of which will contribute to greater mining security of Bitcoin.

core dev has already eliminated 0 fees.  there is a minfee of 0.0001BTC which you get to pay.  those companies will pay the same thing you pay, so what's the problem?
miners aren't going to allow just any lowball fee, they have the ability to set minfee wherever they like.  Marshall Long and Sam Cole just got done telling you at Scaling that this is what they do so don't expect anyone, even companies, to not pay fees.

it seems it wouldn't have mattered if Antpool had upgraded or not b/c they simply listen to f2pool stratum API to mine off the hash and not verify the block.  plus, if you look at the sequence of 5 spv blocks following the BTCNugget v2 block, Antpool was block  of 5, so it wasn't them who got the spv part of the fork rolling.  it was f2pool.

with bigger blocks, you're neglecting the fact that Western miners will proliferate thus increasing their share of the hashrate.  plus, big blocks don't have to mean the end of Chinese dominance.  as has said, there are ways thru the GFW to nodes that can assemble getblocktemplate.  i also think that their gvts willingness to come out last wk saying they won't harm Bitcoin indicates their desire to see it work according to the principles we've had over the last 6 yrs.

That thread has been linked to many times in this debate and your snippet is taken out of context. Satoshi didn't mean what you're inferring, as in not raising the limit ever. He was talking about versioning in an increase over time once miners reached a threshold percentage which he describes further down in the same thread. And that was because jgarzik simply put up a patch not warning people about applying the patch haphazardly resulting in forking themselves of the network inadvertently.

@_date: 2015-06-26 14:38:18
All you have to know is that miners don't have to include all TX's in their blocks. They have the freedom to pick and choose. We have clear evidence of the defensive moves they can take during the spam attacks of the last few weeks. And that is to mine a 0 TX block. If the unconfirmed TX set rises, then we move on to solving that problem via a variety of good solutions. But I doubt it will be a long term problem because the attack starts to get expensive at 8MB and beyond and if anything, strengthens miners through high fees which is the last thing an attacker wants to do. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:54:58


b/c pools outside of China will be able to take advantage of superior bandwidth to compete with them by producing bigger blocks and providing more tx throughput for the network which will be considered very valuable to worldwide growth of Bitcoin's user and merchant base.  this will diminish China's market share and even out the network of miners.

Who are you to say this as long as those same companies pay TX fees and we can figure out how to run full nodes? Which I believe we can with techs like pruning and UTXO set reconciliations. Most of their embedding only requires a 32 byte hash anyways. But I also agree with you that Bitcoin should attempt to be first and foremost a currency. But it doesn't need LN or SC's to do that either. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:02:06

what will go away is preventing Western miners from utilizing superior BW to process more tx's via bigger blocks.

right now with the 1MB cap, China is able to maintain it's mining advantage with cheap labor, electricity, cheap commodities and manufacturing.  this has allowed them to build the advantage they have today. they've told us they want to maintain small blocks b/c of the GFW as they are afraid bigger blocks of theirs will be orphaned.  if all they needed was to be connected to other Chinese miners behind the GFW, they wouldn't be objecting to bigger blocks as there would be nothing to fear.  in fact, according to your theory, they should be begging for blocks to exacerbate this supposed advantage.  but they're not.
in fact, the opposite is occurring and you should listen to them.  they want to maintain small blocks which maintains the 60% mining advantage they have now.  if the network does the opposite, ie allow bigger blocks, then the opposite should happen, ie, that 60% advantage should dissipate as it allows the growth of mining in the West via facilitating the formation of bigger blocks.  new mining players would enter the space and process more tx's thus growing network capacity.  users and merchants will want to support that emphasis and feed on it as it will mean cheaper tx fees and no conf delays, like we have now.  these new miners will make more by processing ever more tx's thus facilitating the long envisioned strategy of Satoshi to transition away from rewards.

9 of the most active core devs under the Blockstream umbrella can easily sway opinion. I bet you there are alot of other for profit companies that have a problem with this. Especially the ones you've labeled as spammers ; factoid, cp, etc. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:02:15
Let them cry. Bitcoin is a force for good so if they want to allow themselves to be forked off the network through their local bandwidth problems, so be it. I say do something about it. It will give miners round the world a chance to level the playing field. And if Wall street really does  want to get into Bitcoin, this will give them a chance to build their own mines. That would be a good thing too so as to further decentralize the process. Personally I think the Chinese gvt will allow their miners to step it up to stay competitive. Bitcoin is their chance to challenge the dollar which is why they haven't crushed it yet.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:50:22
yeah, but it would be even more terrible if those cool things depended on Bitcoin proper being deprecated or even discarded.

I don't blame you. There's at least 300 pages of debate. Both Adam and Greg entered the convo, mostly Adam and it was no use in trying to explain. It's complex economically and quite a bit depends on your view of what Bitcoin is. Personally, I think the financial conflicts run too deep for them to get what all of us are saying. I know you have faith in their motives but I can't allow people to not consider the possibility that positive developments in a SC won't ever be back ported to Bitcoin. Their refusal to give 1 inch on the 1MB issue, to me, validated that position. That was also the key to swinging several of the tech types in my thread who originally were strong SC supporters to my way of thinking. Bitcoin has evolved to that of a public good and should not be controlled by any entity with a financial conflict. That's just me. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:15:18
who's to say the cap isn't psychologically effecting growth at 50%?  tx's don't have to consistently hit the cap to effect ppl's negative projections.

i'm really tired of hearing that meme.  how can a niche primarily geek supported hodl'd currency become a settlement network?  clearly it will fail long before that when choked down to 1MB.

@_date: 2015-06-05 18:54:50
LOL, this quote just cut the legs out from Blockstream's main objection to raising the block limit; that being the large block attack  from large miners on small miners supposedly facilitated by "superior"  bandwidth connections. Well, the largest miners in the world are telling us they have "inferior"  connections! Lol! What a bunch of amateurs; that being Blockstream. 
“A very large block size would be problematic for miners because the network bandwidth between China, where the majority of mining is done, and rest of the world is heavily restricted. Important proposals like these need to factor in all of the nuances of the global landscape.”
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:19:42


a soft fork is much more disingenuous.  it's a reflection of the core devs not believing they have consensus.
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:45:35


but as you indicate, an attacking miner would have had to *know* somehow that 1MB was too small of an effect and somehow *know* that 20MB is large enough to have an effect.  more likely is that it's not perceived to be an effective attack *ever* as it is not worth the cost and effort and can likely be reversed or mitigated making it useless and too expensive for the attacker.
furthermore, small miners can easily just mine SPV blocks to avoid the choking that is trying to FUD.  his argument is so simplistic it's embarrassing.


@_date: 2015-06-28 15:33:56
that's b/c my complaints started over a year ago with the basic concept of sidechains, then accelerated last October when Blockstream was announced (realized financial conflicts), and then, imo, were validated starting 2 mo or so ago with the start of this block size debate resulting in a climax.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:35:59
Maybe just enough to accommodate the spvp? 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:19:16
I think his point is that for the Krone, it's maximum use case is realized for the geographic region it is intended to be used within. In Bitcoin's case we *know * it can be used worldwide, if let it. We just have to figure out technically how to best make that happen. 
That would be the ultimate in decentralization and security for Bitcoin's future.

hey, in case you hadn't noticed, i'm just parroting you and your position on this whole thing about consensus.  in fact, one of your guys, i think it was Wiulle, said we need 100% consensus on these things.  yes, he's referring to hard forks.  but what if Gavin counters, it doesn't matter about soft or hard, we need 100% consensus on ANY protocol change.
at this point, i'd have to agree with him.

another way to look at it is 2 yr ago, when price was at $106, did you predict we would have gone thru the growth we have in Bitcoin?  given that this is a first ever new money for the internet, what chances does it have to drive further growth of internet capacities you may not similarly be aware of 20 yr ago when the internet was in it's infancy?  are you that confident your calculations will be spot on?
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:58:29
I disagree. Full nodes are way more resilient than any LN hub could ever hope to be. By sheer number only. Also, by the fact that their ledgers are way more redundant. I'm beginning to doubt your sincerity on this. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:21:45
Yes, his language is dripping with disdain towards Gavin. Adam is doing the same thing. It's sad but true. They ARE losing credibility.

Except the are legions of people who have stored coins in cold wallets in vaults all over the world and have forgotten about them who don't frequent this forum much like gold holders have for centuries. What is our social obligation to them just because some for profit company wants to change Bitcoin to facilitate their business model? 
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:18:28


that's a false assumption.  ex: you're the very first node to relay a new tx generated next door from one of your 8 connections.  your relay to your other 7 connections is new info to the network.


yeah, i guess, if that's the definition of a full node which i get.  simply relaying though is still very important.
@_date: 2015-12-03 11:03:22
I could say the same thing now about China. Bigger blocks will lead to decentralization outside of China, not just in the US.

I understand what the ideal vision is. But go to my gold thread and read forward from October 22nd 2014 for much more in depth debate about what actually is going on with SC's culminating in this block size conflict which has now allowed me to convince all but a couple of of my skeptics in the thread to my view of what Blockstream actually is doing whether conscious or not.

@_date: 2015-06-01 17:22:59
sorry you have to view it that way.
what Gavin is trying to do is expand the community of users and maximize decentralization round the world for maximum security.  the more jurisdictions it can penetrate, esp those hostile to where Bitcoin is centralized now like the US &amp; Europe, the more secure it will be.  1MB blocks is clearly ham stringing that growth and putting Bitcoin in jeopardy.  
what i also hope happens, as a side effect, is that a new team of core devs get recruited for XT.  while i appreciate diversity of opinion, the divergence has gotten to an extreme from, imo, the Blockstream coalition being financially conflicted.
can u imagine how bullish it would be to have a new group of core devs being put in place that could cooperate more fully leading to more responsive changes in the mkt via the code?
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:45:43
they discussed this 24/7 requirement in the Epicenter Bitcoin podcast.  what good is a LN if it isn't available 24/7 for all those microtx's?  you expect ppl to wait for the hub to come back?

yes.  we can have thousands of large server nodes that store the entire chain with average user full nodes that are pruned to mainly carry an up to date UTXO set keeping the requirements down well below todays full node.

you still haven't proven it's spam and fees 20x higher just might.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:49:14
wait, i'm not sure i understand your assumptions.
a full node only need to serve block headers to an inquiring SPV.  when it comes to a tx, it only needs to then serve the block headers down to the tx in question and then only the specific Merkle *path* to the inputs.  no blocks involved.  the data feed is minimal.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:18:58
depends on how you define stupid.  clearly we have different definitions.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:54:31

@_date: 2015-06-27 20:18:34


it's certainly possible but that's what i remember. but i'll take your word for it.
btw, is there not any pressure?

these ppl aren't insane, they're financially conflicted.
@_date: 2015-06-13 02:11:59
but it's balanced by the fact that those same large 32MB blocks will get orphaned by propagation delays so they may not ever have a chance to choke the nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:36:16
if you have 8333 closed and thus have only 8 connections, do you still serve the blockchain to new nodes?
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:52:15


exactly. and from the perspective of an active business.  the core devs just won't listen to this simple logic.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:39:21

@_date: 2015-06-17 20:32:28
well, if it happens once why would i not think it is capable of happening again?
and yes, i get that it would be a zero sum game if we had to migrate.  but that by itself is not a game i would continue to participate in due to the involved losses that violated my initial presumptions.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:59:27
What's mind boggling to me is that aren't too many devs out there who don't think they could've done things better than satoshi. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 03:27:05
they did upgrade their software but failed to enforce the version 3 b/c they used the stratum API shortcut to mine off the hash w/o validating the block itself.

@_date: 2015-06-09 02:59:33
well said.  here's looking at you @_date: 2015-06-11 16:54:37
thanks for that.
ok, but your above scenario of exclusive growth of unreachable nodes ignores simultaneous growth of reachable nodes as a counterbalance.  to the extent that the network resiliency is strengthened by merely relaying tx's and blocks by unreachable nodes, this fact alone could contribute to the growth of reachable nodes.
in other words, there is no reason to think one would grow w/o growth of the other so we shouldn't be encouraging ppl to shut off their unreachable nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:59:17
Oh, and their WP talks about possible need for MC owners to have to migrate to the SC if it becomes dominant. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:56:30

Do you ever bring any real arguments? 
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:08:09
You're absolutely right. 
Listen to Christian Decker's latest Epicenter Bitcoin podcast where he talks about his variation on LN. Same thing essentially. He calls hubs PSP's or payment service processors which will charge fees for every movement of funds. The psp or hub will centrally try to maximally position itself to be in the middle of every tx within the channel so as to charge maximal fees. They will essentially try to replace miners with this strategy. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:55:50


it's a 32 bit hash.  not a big deal esp when they have to transact and pay fees to store it there.  
@_date: 2015-12-01 03:24:52
i'm glad to see you went back and did the research to correct your previously incorrect statements.  afaik, all 3 of those pools, Antpool, f2pool, and BTCC had upgraded their software but *failed to enforce* the version 3 blocks as well as failed to validate the version 2 block that BTCNugget produced.  if they hadn't upgraded their software presumably the soft fork allowing the upgrade at the 95% level wouldn't have ever triggered.  if you disagree, you'll have to supply a link showing that Antpool never upgraded.

@_date: 2015-06-20 16:44:44
it could be.  turning off all new users b/c of unconfirmed tx's and high fees could centralize Bitcoin so much that it could then be vulnerable to attack by gvts.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:05:55
the debate you're referring is shrouded by the fact that i believe their is a financial conflict. it doesn't have to be this contentious esp in light of Satoshi's original vision.
a block size increase is the simplest, easiest, and most understandable way to deal with the full blocks we are seeing now.
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:13:02
you being so new can be forgiven to remember that China still has banned all it's banking/financial institutions from using banking whereas the US has not.
@_date: 2015-12-18 03:16:11
maybe not, maybe so.  i think it does.  at least for appearances sake, which is important too. 
but the pt we were discussing is that as userbase grows, businesses all_over_the_world will grow to service them.  these businesses will create full nodes either in house or outsource them as you suggest.  either way, the  nodes will increase in proportion to the increased userbase.  and that will maintain full node decentralization as you desire.

if tx fees are supposed to be what drives the survival of miners long term on the mainchain, how does attracting some of those over onto a SC help in that regard?  this would for sure happen if miners actually defect to the SC but would still be somewhat of a valid concern with merge mining.

Actuary I think it would invalidate the whole concept. Because not only will lots of early adopters who funded the current network effect lose everything if another altcoin or sidechain takes over, but the fundamental tenet that Bitcoin was supposed to be able to adapt to external threats through its open source mechanism and the supposed ability to fork goes out the window. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:49:40
the real problem is that core devs are picking winners and losers with the 1MB choke.  nodes win; miners, users, merchants lose via dec growth and tx fees.  ultimately everyone in Bitcoin loses as it withers and dies.

what it does is make miners more responsible for efficient block sizes in negotiation with user tx fees, which is a very good thing, instead of depending on clueless core dev central planning that has no idea of the internal financial conditions of miners.

No, initially you said this:  "This is what is happening with the blocksize debate. Objections, *counter-proposals*, discussions." 
Since we've been talking about Blockstream, that statement is misleading; because they haven't. And it is not a trivial objection on my part. One of the most maddening things about this debate to us had been the LACK of counter proposals.

and that would be to give them too much credit.  that would be too devious even for them.
no, much better to form your own company, BS, choke Bitcoin proper, get $21M in investment money, and deliver on potentially thousand of consulting contracts that turn Bitcoin-SC's into a speculative platform.
b/c that's what SC's fundamentally do; they disaggregate the financial unit from it's restrictive blockchain to allow infinite  of derivative SC's that can be used for speculation.  have you EVER heard BS put a limitation on the types of SC's that can be created?  no.  it's infinite.  all which suck desperately needed tx fees off the MC to SC's.  and, to top it all off, they want a subsidy thru a mechanism called "merge mining".  i actually think miners won't be suckered into that nor have the time, energy, or financial motivation to rewrite thousands of different versions of mining code for each SC.  not to mention the headaches of admin.  take it from a former solo miner.

no one is suggesting they need to be kind.  in fact, if you knew anything about economics, you'd realize the incentives of open source Bitcoin encourages them to be greedy; which is what we want.
with no block limit, they will be forced to defend themselves from spam attacks; if they want.  based on their own internal cost benefit analysis, which core devs can't make btw, they'll determine if they want to either 1. soak the spammer for all the fees they can get at the risk of getting orphaned, or 2. filter the spam so as to create small, quickly propagating blocks.  furthermore, all this behind the scenes calculation will be taken with regards to fees the users wish to pay.  btw, no one can tell with any certainty what is and what is not spam so all your machinations to the contrary are ridiculous.  what this will create is an equilibrium only they can create.
what this does is gets rid of core devs picking winners and losers or more importantly, advancing their own pet financially conflicted objectives.  w/o a limit, we get a true functioning fee market based on the players that matter; users and miners.

that's a strange sort of logic b/c i think the opposite.
for instance, i run a bunch of full nodes and i don't even bother to use them for my own tx's.  why?  b/c by running a bunch of full nodes AND surveying the entire aggregate  nodes in the network, i am confident that i won't get Sybiled.  it's just not a concern given my long and reliable history of using Bitcoin.  yes, i think it would be more important for a merchant pumping thru lotsa tx's per day to run their own full node but for a casual user like myself, i like to run as many full nodes as possible (motivation is to secure my investment) and not worry about transacting thru my own nodes.

that really doesn't make sense b/c large limit increases are what will allow large amounts of tx fees to replace what has been lost in rewards.
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:37:32


well i guarantee that will have to be the case with the current situation of a 1MB cap which is blocking and delaying a signif # tx's currently.  the only way to know for sure is to lift the cap and let 'er run.   go here and look at the exponentially rising  and hashrate over the last 6 yrs w/o bumping up against the cap.  that should continue if we lift the cap.  i think there will be plenty of security on the blockchain if we allow it to continue.  
furthermore, the exchange should ramp with that growth.  that will drag the hashrate and  up with it solidifying the security you're looking for.
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:29:40


how cheap does it need to be?
i run six nodes myself.  it's cheap.  even if the price went up 10x i'd still run them for the network at the current exchange price.  if the price went up concomitantly, i'd probably run double that number of nodes.
businesses can easily afford a node.  it's also safer for them.
@_date: 2015-12-19 04:42:09

@_date: 2015-06-30 21:39:34
that's strange.  5G mem should be plenty.  all my nodes did fine with 1GB mem with 2.3GB vswap.  relative utilization was 1:2 with a total of about 0.92GB during peaks.

@_date: 2015-06-10 01:51:38
yeah, gotta admit that looks like spam.  just to play devil's advocate though, a Venezuelan bank crisis with intense buying by one of their exchanges might cause something like this. however, i agree something should be done.  but it should be done *now* and not just ignored by the devs as something that will blow over.  it looks bad, doesn't engender alot of faith in even avid users like me when we have potential conflicts of interest in SC's, and certainly will turn new users away.  
@_date: 2015-06-11 04:15:44

@_date: 2015-12-17 20:19:30
you will have both.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:25:51
i have and i agree with LN require 24/7 centralized, specialized nodes for microtx's opening them up to attack.  this was plainly stated by the authors on Epicenter Bitcoin.
SC's federated model required federated servers for signing tx or as protocol adapters which again are centralized and prone to manipulation.  
SC's spvp model likewise requires merge mining.  by definition, they will never get 100% current Bitcoin mainchain miners to merge mine a SC thus they become insecure.  let's say a SC is lucky enough to get the top 5 Chinese miners, or 65% of the current hashrate, to support a SC.  all it would take is for 2 of those of those 5 to collude to perform a 51% attack on the SC to destroy it and any coin that had been moved over to it.  in fact, it doesn't cost them anything b/c after they finish the attack they can freely go back to mining the mainchain as they always had.  thus, no self imposed hardware losses compared to a similar attack on the mainchain which is their bread and butter.
furthermore, moving tx paying fees over to a SC hurts the mainchain by siphoning those fees necessary to replace the block rewards that are being cut in half every 4y.  you might argue that merge mining wouldn't do that but you can imagine that there will be miners who exclusively choose to mine the SC and this would be a net loss in fees and thus for the security of the mainchain.  
also, why should mainchain miners even support SC's in the first place thru merge mining just to feed the for profit model of Blockstream?  BS is asking for a free subsidy essentially.  this feeds a particular business model while simultaneously taking away the business model of Factom, CP, colored coins or any other business that has *already* evolved around inserting data into op_return that is dependent on cheap fees.
also, does the current extreme obstruction by the BS folks to increase the obviously needed 1MB limit give anyone confidence around here that any innovations developed on a SC will in fact be back ported to Bitcoin mainchain or Core?

i get the concern.  we talk about it all the time.  but consider the game theory.
first, how easy is it to secretly commission an ASIC fab?  pretty impossible for the commercial ones as they are SO busy with large companies like Apple, Sansung.  what about building a private one?  still damn hard.  that is primarily scut work.  what NSA employees are gonna do that?  where are they gonna get the power, water, supplies?  hiring foreigners you say?  well then the NSA has to trust common folk foreigners.  pretty dicey.  i bet some of the powerful ASIC miners nowadays employ their own spies across the industry hunting for foul play from just this type of attack.  can a gvt really afford to be caught trying to kill Bitcoin at this pt?  what about the billionaires round the world like Branson, Li Ka Shing, etc who own BTC now?  are they and their lawyers just gonna stand by as the USG destroys the whole network after it's been deemed legal here in the US and just about everywhere else?  can the armchair NSA hacks really afford to get caught using an illegal scheme of this sort after all the shit they've been caught doing the last few years?  after we just got Section 215 repealed?  no, the pendulum is swinging in the right direction for us and i for one am very happy for that.  
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:00:15
not sure what propagation has to do with the &lt;1min blocks.
this is a defensive strategy being employed by the largest 2 mining pools who automatically start mining 0 tx blocks when they receive a full block.  they do this b/c they aren't sure if there are going to be any invalid tx's contained in that full block that they haven't fully validated yet that would then cause a subsequent invalidation of any other tx's they might have included in the 0 tx block.
b/c hashing produces a random target whether a block contains or doesn't contain any tx's, i fail to see why these 0 tx blocks are consistently coming in at &lt;1min after a preceding block.
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:38:54
all 6 of mine will be fine.
if we get the expected increase in userbase as a result of 20MB blocks, i will add more full nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:54:25
So there are 2 merkle roots, one of which goes into the header as usual, and the other for the sigs into the coinbase tx? 
@_date: 2015-12-01 05:20:27
but headers with hashes get received before the body of the blocks even on the p2p network so you'd think they'd relay these right away.

I do get it. My comment about fee loss was in regards to SC's not LN. Actually, I am much less opposed to LN, despite its centralization, simply because it keeps fees, to a degree, on the mainchain. This is still not entirely good for miners. 
If one sets up high volume micropayment channels on a certain LN hub, how can it afford to be offline at all? 
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:56:42


that is not even a necessary condition.  b/c to imply that, which i'm not saying you're doing, is to not understand what money is.  and by that i mean that the money VC's or investors pour into the dev community is *just as* important as the ability to dev.  why?  b/c money represents a SOV that has through the choice of the VC or investor been given or turned over to the dev community to help realize Bitcoin's ultimate vision and goal.  that *stored wealth* has been entrusted to those devs to perform responsibly and consider *everyone's* opinion in the community.  not just devs.

what about all those ppl, nodes, and miners who don't frequent this forum?  of course, under those circumstances, lots of them won't find out about an emergency fork and we should expect multiple forks occurring as a result of a quick action like that.  that's not good and entirely avoidable if the core devs were only willing to plan ahead which i'd argue is supposed to be their mandate.
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:08:25
you know, part of this is that the 1MB crowd has been so uncooperative in the face of this problem some of us have been having to suggest anything to get a compromise.  that's not working at all so i've come to the conclusion we have to keep on the same consistent message; increase the blocksize. if you keep switching around strategies, nothing will get done.

since when has that ever happened in Bitcoin's history?  the last coupla weeks of spam attacks has actually been encouraged by the limit as real tx's have come close to filling approx 50% and spamming has become *less* expensive (takes less spam and expense to fill up blocks).  so if we go to 8MB, it will actually cost more than 8x worth of spam to fill blocks.  but miners are more than capable of how they want to handle that situation as they've proven multiple times over the last few attacks by forming 0 tx blocks as a defensive maneuver.  OR, they can just accept the spam with all it's required tx fees and make a bundle leading to an actual *strenthening* of mining from a profitability standpoint which is the *last* thing an attacking spammer wants to see.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:57:00
it's more complex than that.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:38:58
But if he forks to XT, he'll be lead. With automation he may be able to sit back for years. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:24:59
so are we to then conclude that SC's will NOT help with scaling?
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:55:58


i contend they aren't mutual exclusive.  as long as the supply remains fixed, it can also serve as a payment network while also settling imbalances btwn nations.
@_date: 2015-12-02 19:54:08
all the Endpoints need updating though.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:43:05
it is a distraction.
so get rid of it for now by lifting the limit and letting the free mkt figure it out.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:14:09
nvm.  got it working.
how do i actually tell if i'm running XT?
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:19:20
You respond with conjecture about Satoshi's motives in the face of a fact? 
And, did I anywhere say he didn't hand off the lead position to Wladimir, on his own volition, I might add?
You are so entrenched in your position you can't even see straight to read properly.

@_date: 2015-06-27 14:44:29
if you were Gavin and took the lead of the winning fork, would you allow them back on board?  serious question...
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:41:38
Lol, cool story bro! 
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:32:18
they've told us they want thousands of SC's with absolutely *no limit* on whatever speculative asset, sidecoin, or currency you could possibly dream up.  that sounds like inflation to me.
the whole stated purpose, by them, of splitting the BTC unit from the mainchain, is to *free up* it's value from its mainchain restrictions.  well, those restrictions are what makes Bitcoin what it is; a self contained sound money system.
how many times have we scoffed at the idea of banks constructing a blockchain w/o BTC?  well, this is the same thing as the 2 way peg is a high friction passthrough to a SC.  there is lots of USD to be made from consulting fees in this situation.  meanwhile the mainchain languishes from lack of tx fees.
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:23:50
Why would I want to move all my TX's to a centralized service who reports everything? 
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:00:20
I don't know. You'd have to ask the 3 dozen or more wallet coders out there how complicated that would be. That's if you could find them all to ask and alert them to the problem. Is it that out of the question to increase block size? Is that really your position now? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:52:42
one last question.  i used this single script to install my node.  is it compatible with everything so far?:
wget -O btcNode.sh  ; sudo bash btcNode.sh

@_date: 2015-06-12 16:36:38
a miner has to take the risk to mine that into his own block tho, right?
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:46:22
No, what's making this hard fork necessary and therefore contentious is that a small group of devs are pushing what's contrary to what the vast majority of the community wants and needs, larger blocks. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:11:12
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:09:53
Yes and people forget that there are many optimizations to be had along the way. We just have to be willing to do them. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:30:55
and that list is *incomplete* in that it doesn't include Huobi, BTCChina exchanges, nor the 5 top Chinese miners, BTCChina, Huobi, f2pool, Antminer, &amp; BWpool on the pro side
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:11:13
but "voting" via BIP100 requires the initial vote, by whatever agreed upon means (that in itself will be controversial), and then a second time via versioning of blocks (assuming the increase needs to reach a certain % before it gets turned on).
with Gavin's latest proposal, the "vote", only has to takes place once and via a means we already know works well; block versioning.
@_date: 2015-06-22 04:47:09
And Gavin is actually trying to automate himself away from being benevolent dictator. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:58:16
look at the complexity of what these core devs have been working on when they should be working on solutions to allow Bitcoin Core to scale:
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:02:00
“We have really good communication with Gavin Andresen on this issue."
mining really is the last piece to Gavin's puzzle and that quote is telling.  everyone else in the space clearly has an interest in seeing tx growth; users, merchants, exchanges.  and they have expressed themselves as such.  the only one's that were questionable were the miners; esp the big Chinese one's that had spoken up a couple of weeks ago.  now that they seem to be clearly onboard with the Big Picture, which Blockstream clearly isn't, the only thing remaining is just exactly how much we are going to increase the block size.  since 8MB is completely fine with them, that should be the starting point.  we definitely should build in an automatic increase.
the only part that makes me pause is this voting mechanism for block size expansion which was part of Jeff's proposal.  but overall, quite positive.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:27:25
It's been stated by many people other than me. 1MB choked blocks push TX's to centralized offchain solutions like SC's and LN. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:20:16
It's to bad you never address the actual questions we have but instead use ad hominems. 
For example, any should any of us want to use a centralized federated server for our transactions that can easily be attacked? 
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:23:19
Congratulations. Very impressive. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:50:55
Coinkite just abandoned 1MB. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:12:59
you expect ordinary users to figure that out?
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:12:32
but there are certain core devs who think they can figure this all out for us.
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:26:59
if you'd follow history and mkts, that was what 2008 was all about.  the financial meltdown was in_our_face.  the only thing that saved it was the same thing they always do; debase the currencies thru QE.  and in case you hadn't noticed it yet, mkts are rolling as we speak. 
yes, initial uses will skyrocket in developing countries, as we see it doing today.  but it WILL come to developed countries as well as their is nothing special we're doing except living off the past in regards to currency debasement.
if you truly expect Bitcoin to be a digital gold or settlement currency, the gold miners and gold users have to stop digging for metal and start using Bitcoin cheaply &amp; reliably.  1MB is the antithesis of that outcome as it will cramp usage to the small  users who will capitulate in a heartbeat to gvt pressure and regs.  that compared to a little African kid who would care less what the USG says if he can reliably use Bitcoin.  as it is, 1MB won't even allow him to do that.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:50:44

@_date: 2015-06-12 10:30:51
So if you were admittedly so against block size increases 4y ago and Gavin has been so obviously for block size increases beginning 3y, ago why are you claiming you are so shocked and in such disbelief that he is now proposing the fork? 
Do you seriously expect us all to believe he never talked to you about it? Why do several neutral devs concur that Gavin has made these pleas to you long ago? 
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:23:32

i think you'll be able to tell from the list of who's following who.  for instance, the only major players i could tell from Technomages list was Coinkite.  there may have been one or two more but nothing compared to the pros like BTCGuild, Coinbase, BitPay, Armory, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:51:12
how can they be fake when they're building blocks with the next versioning upgrade embedded?
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:10:10
OK, the ultimate secure platform would be Armory offering multi sig with Trezor since Armory requires you to run your own full node. 
I conclude you should try to get your Blue product integrated with Armory via multi sig.

i could get behind something like this altho i'd rather start around 5MB.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:42:43
what i find interesting is that i've *never* seen the guy.  and i pay close attention to everything Bitcoin.  this may be unfair but it makes me wonder about his social abilities.  with Gavin, i at least get a very good sense that he is a good guy who's mature and not overbearing.  when he speaks, ppl listen.  he is calm, cool, and collected.  he knows how to interact with ppl.  he's gained a huge following as a competent leader over the years.  there was never any controversy over his leadership until the past few months when this block size debate came up.  the degree to which the character assassination folks have come out against him should be revealing.  to me, it reflects desperation.  
Adam told me that if Blockstream fails, there will be alot of very powerful SV ppl upset.  he stopped there and didn't say "at him" but the implication was there.  the BS core devs are under enormous pressure to deliver a huge return on that investment money.

@_date: 2015-06-10 02:26:14
seems a simple fix.  
what's with our core devs?
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:33:15
Gavin shows none of the dictatorial characteristics that the 1MB'ers are trying to claim. I've studied him carefully ever since my adoption. He has continually encouraged different competing implementations of the code base like btcd, BitcoinJ, &amp; libbetcoin in the name of diversity and resiliency. Realize they have their own core devs that he had no control over nor desired to. . He also gave away over 10000 bitcoin through his faucet without a stitch of remorse. During his lead dev reign he publicly stated his main coding concerns were simply dedicated to security and usability while at the same time letting all the other devs continuously tinker with the edges of the code to assuage their concerns. 
I think it was a big mistake to ever have turned the position over to someone I've never even seen or heard speak in public before. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:27:49
Blockstream is a for-profit company with $21M invested by shareholders who expect returns on the order of 10x.  having 3 committers of 5 and around 3-4 more on the core dev team give them considerable power to effect concensus or block concensus.  yes, their pay and equity options are a conflict as increasing the block size will keep more tx's on mainchain and decrease the need for sidechains.  they "say" sidechains aren't for scaling but if you think about it clearly, every tx that occurs on a sidechain does not occur on the mainchain and therefore the fees don't get paid to miners on the mainchain.  next you'll say "merge mining".  yes, but there probably will be miners who mine a sidechain exclusively again which takes away fees from mainchain which needs those long term to take the place of ever decreasing block rewards.  this was satoshi's original vision of how Bitcoin would work that being able to scale to Visa size via mainchain scaling.  
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:10:42
I don't think the code needs to make that assessment. Which is part of the reason I like it. 
Just look at market metrics like hashing power, merchant adoption, number of node's, etc.

Well, as your example of 20MB SC implies, it could get preferentially used if they MC sticks to 1MB blocks. Don't forget the 2wp is not friction less. There's at least a 2d tie up according to their WP.  Also, the SC by definition is able to do something the MC can't. Also, if miners start migrating preferentially to the SC, that also causes asymmetry in value. There should be a tipping point. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:22:05

@_date: 2015-12-19 20:39:23


bullshit.  source?
i'm betting that you're referring to the fact that i've set up 5 or so XT nodes in support of XT *which i previously had been running as Core*.  even if i hadn't been running them previously as Core, how is that a Sybil attack according to std definitions?  answer:  it's NOT.  but according to your delusional mind, mulitple nodes set up by guys like me are to be considered malicious as opposed to sincerly trying to help by providing more connection/relay points for new and established users to download a new blockchain and perform ordinary tx's.  
what your view demonstrates is how fucked up you and your ilk have polluted Bitcoin.  you're a disgrace to everything we're working towards. and your comments and censorship of posts as a mod of r/bitcoin are proof.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:49:36
the difference is that XT is what the *vast* majority of the community wants based on several independent polls and my reading of bitcointalk and here.  it should attract the vast majority of economic actors.  if that happens, Core becomes the altcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-13 15:09:53
This is a centralizing problem. The LN nodes have to be on 24/7 for you to transact. This allows them to be attacked. Unlike the Bitcoin network where nodes can come and go yet still catch up with the rest of the blockchain. And unlike Bitcoin transactions which will be processed instantly.

yes, the 1MB will choke itself and anyone who persists with it.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:21:26
It is not a seamless peg. We know at minimum it will take 2d to sufficiently have faith in the proof. Also, the 2 chains won't be equal in security nor will they have equal capabilities. When the market gets the sense that one chain is becoming more dominant the other will get sold off and mining security will drop with it. Traversing the peg will then become impossible since you need a miner to help reverse the proof. They discuss this possibility in the WP. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:02:49
You know you're running out of time.

@_date: 2015-06-14 16:42:55
we should probably rephrase this argument for greater understanding.  it provides the highest amt of utility to it's "owner".
@_date: 2015-12-02 18:15:10
here's my take.
the relay network is a perversion of the Bitcoin Protocol by encouraging bad behavior of non-validation hatched out of Corallo's paranoid mind.  he is so worried about the now thoroughly debunked large miner (Chinese), large block attack vs small miners that he created such a perversion.
as a reaction to the relay network threat, the Chinese are using spv mining to counteract the relay network.
bottom line:  paranoid core dev is the root of the problem 
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:22:43
Wat? 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:38:11
no, he probably didn't b/c he was buying BTC as an investment as most of us have. however, that doesn't invalidate his pt.  in fact, it's critical to his objectives as Bitcoin's success depends on later adopters who simply *use* BTC as a payment network. for this to happen, they have to reliably and cheaply access the network as new users.  unconfirmed tx's or $100 fees will kill their interest and therefore his investment.  
there is NOTHING wrong with his strategy as this is how complex evolving systems grow esp in the age of the internet.
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:25:16
Umm, too much logic? 
@_date: 2015-06-20 02:02:42
Hashcash itself failed and was not a success.
Thankfully, the POW concept survived.

@_date: 2015-06-24 16:45:52
yeah, like what do my valid complaints about financial conflicts of interest for Blockstream and this blocks size limit thing have anything to do with my dispute with a mining company?
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:02:32


thank you
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:43:40


and the above is severely going to degrade, wither and die with 1MB choke.  that "backing" as you call is worthless unless it is secured by billions of ppl worldwide who believe in Bitcoin and can use it cheaply and reliably.  why force all new users to centralized offchain implementations like LN and SC's just to allow Blockstream to profit?
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:12:20
the other thing here is that IF Gavin has gotten his automated upgrade schedule correct, there is a *good* chance Bitcoin will never be hard forked again.  FUDsters will scream that it opens the possiblity up to an increase in the 21M bitcoin supply but that will *never* happen b/c the majority of Bitcoiners don't even contest/think about that thus would never switch over.
@_date: 2015-06-21 19:38:32


This is the crux of the debate. I'd much rather be stuck having to cut back on block size rather than never know or realize Bitcoin's capabilities.

nothing to panic about though.  even if you switch your node to XT, the block won't be opened up right away to &gt;1MB blocks until there's enough nodes that have switched over, just to be safe.
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:54:19
Yes, miners verify TX's but they also cement them into the blockchain through POW. IOW, they order them and put a cost on trying to alter them. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 22:44:33


can you explain this more?  it has to do with p2sh multisig?
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:58:41
agreed.  frustration is setting in.  but increasing block size is what, a single setting in the code vs getting all those wallet providers and their users to concoct a complicated formula for fees?
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:42:04
What is the name of the concept? Wikipedia didn't respond to "O"  ;) 
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:53:49


this quote just cut the legs out from Blockstream's main objection to raising the block limit; that being the large block attack  on small miners supposedly facilitated by "superior"  bandwidth connections. Well, the top 3 largest miners in the world are Chinese and are telling us they have "inferior"  connections:
“A very large block size would be problematic for miners because the network bandwidth between China, where the majority of mining is done, and rest of the world is heavily restricted. Important proposals like these need to factor in all of the nuances of the global landscape.”
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:50:29
the desperate tone of the 1MB'ers has now evolved to that of "Satoshi was wrong".  really, i say?
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:12:48
This is true 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:27:38
but they require 24/7 centralized nodes.  yes, they have to be 24/7 unlike what you said earlier b/c they're dealing with *microtransactions", ie, heavy use which require constant access or the whole concept doesn't work.  that makes them vulnerable to attack.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:03:59
what Gavin's XT proposal does is not only automate out financiers, banksters, politicians, &amp; corrupt gvts, but also DEVS.  
esp a few core devs who think they know better.
and that, imo, is a worthy goal.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:12:47
I bet we have an insignificant number behind Tor. I'd welcome any stats if you have them that suggest otherwise. I'd bet VPN would be easy more common. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:08:40
no, you just don't understand.
advocating for the status quo of 1MB cap means advocating for 60% of the hashing power to remain centralized in China.  that is the height hypocrisy and misunderstanding of Bitcoin which typifies you.
lifting that cap allows the Western world to compete using the one advantage they have; superior BW.  really can't make it anymore crystal than that for your peabrain.
you seem lost now that your great leader is 
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:41:00
Again, we're on the topic of Blockstream. When I say they haven't made any counter proposals to Gavin, this is true. When you say they have, that's not true. Sheesh.

au contraire.  if anyone should be in favor of 1MB choke, it would be me.  i am one of the original goldbug turned Bitcoin bug:

anyone trusting what nullc has to say at this point given his financial conflictions is ignorant.

there was also a "Mystery Miner" that caused all sorts of consternation back in 2012, iirc.  he mined a series of 0 tx blocks repeatedly causing all sorts of doom &amp; gloom theories to pop up.  you can start here and track back:
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:47:40
i agree wholeheartedly

I remember that 
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:17:56


As someone who has staked his reputation on this claim or theory, spending most of his time advocating for it, and being one of the first ones to act on it, you'd think I'd be one of the most strident 1MB proponents. But I'm not. 
The true answer is that until or unless Bitcoin can spread itself out into the most hands of ordinary users across the Internet or across the world, it will never be seen as a universal money that the digital gold proponents foresee. 
Getting bitcoin into the hands of African kids or even Muslim terrorists is the real sure fire way to maximize the security of a new modern digital gold . That would be the ultimate decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:20:15


have you assigned one to Gavin's recent proposal of 8MB?
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:01:01
Gavin, for this to fly we expect you to be lead. An announcement would really help.

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:26:19


Why is this? Is this because they've been able to complete a certain number of hashes before they've fully validated the block? If other pools mimic this behavior wouldn't it then drive the time interval back up towards 10 min? 
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:47:08
Core may be able to fool itself and the core devs running it but in the long run it won't be able to fool market actors, ie, the one's with the money.  they want growth, Core doesn't.  Core will lose.

@_date: 2015-06-12 09:24:28
Yes, the one we talked about directly about 5x yet you claim I've never talked to you ever before the HF incident. Do you want me to pull out all our pms and posts to prove it? Come on. 
Threatened to kill you? Are you that immature to throw that out there? Let me add that to the problem list above. That's a really inappropriate and irresponsible attitude for a CEO or core dev to take you know. Perhaps your reasoning behind refusing to increase block size is similarly exaggerated? 
And yes, that's about the third or fourth time you've said you're right to have banned Matonis and Ver. Quick question. Why is Ver still listed on the current press centre website that you forced the community to have to create? 
@_date: 2015-12-01 01:36:30
he is talking about the SPV mining "fuckup" which clearly refers to the fork it caused.  Antpool only mined one of the blocks.  doesn't justify him singling them out.
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:24:54
it would have to be an entirely new tech that couldn't be integrated into Bitcoin.  i'm all for that altho it would be painful migrating as all those with cold wallets will take losses if they lag or fall behind.  in that sense, there will always be losses in this scenario but if the new tech is THAT good, then that's the breaks.
but i haven't seen such a thing yet.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:04:50
What a joke. 
I've had concerns with SC's for over a year when the concept first came out and with Blockstream's financial conflict since October last year when they came out with their white paper. My issue with the mining company only was filed earlier this year, well after my concerns with Blockstream. 
The issues are unrelated. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 02:52:39
One does not fork a blockchain; one forks code. So in the sense that the first part of what he said makes perfect sense, the second part makes no sense. 
By talking like that I can only conclude that he's trying to be a sensationalist. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:33:36
please consider no limit. that would force miners to actually assess their fee system with the assistance of users.  IOW, create a market.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:01:26
here's a good compilation of those Satoshi's vision:
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:34:15
hmm, you're asking alot. might as well increase the block size.
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:16:07
Its a simplistic unfair proxy for their ultimate much more complex spvp concept which requires a fork. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:38:02
that's simple. please give us bigger blocks
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:34:37
Blockstream is not looking forward on this. Do they think they will every get their spvp through after this? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:10:01
Thank you sir! 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:05:49
the only ppl doing the frightening is the core devs doing the most talking and that is the Blockstream devs.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:01:40
b/c what the last few weeks of disagreement on this topic tells us is that we'll never come to an agreement on the definition of "last minute".
we actually have a clue as to what will happen:
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:11:38


tbh, we *want* growth.  alot of engineering comes from solving one choke pt, another one comes up, solving that choke pt, another one comes up, and then solving that choke pt.  there are lots of optimizations that can be done in Bitcoin and unfortunately alot come from experimentation.  you got to take some chances to grow this thing as large as we know it can be.  if we get problems, we can always back off.  this is how the internet has evolved over the last 30 yrs.
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:18:10
it's certainly possible but that's what i remember.  but i'll take your word for it.
btw, is there not any pressure?

it's the ultimate form of flattery.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:34:47
both gmax and lukejr said that.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:08:32
i don't believe constructing a fee mkt thru an artificial cap limit on block size is a productive process to force wallet providers to have to go through.  it's shifting the problem and is more of a compensation than a real solution.
once you come to the understanding that the real players that should be involved in this fee mkt process is the miners and the users, then you should be able to see that wallet providers can stay out of the loop, at least for now.
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:26:00
these things take time.  what we need is a tute as to how to convert our nodes to XT seamlessly and with the least effort.
we also need to know exactly what's in the XT that's different than Core.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:03:16

in general, github incremental commits are hash verified which chains versions together to ensure integrity from previous versions.  sometimes the author will also pgp sign them.  
yeah, but at some initial point, you have to trust the authors.  i would do this by length of participation, reviews, reputation, etc.
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:44:48
plus, you let the mkt decide what tx fees are to be set btwn the miners and users.  leave fee schemes entirely out of the protocol.  unnecessary complexity and leaves dev bias out.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:24:15
it's going quite well actually.  anyone can read the baseless complaint.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:00:22
The price is also probably rallying because it sees that we are going to solve the hypocrisy that is Blockstream. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:52:35
My bet is consensus won't happen unless we start seeing the number of XT nodes start increasing dramatically.

cc's are not better.  they're denominated in fiat.
Bitcoin's fixed supply guarantees it as a SOV.  in fact, it will create a massive sucking sound that will resonate the world over.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:35:36
Well, imo, we need to increase by several orders of magnitude the number of TX's taking place on the mainchain to provide enough fees to keep miners profitable and hashing at even higher levels than we are now for maximum security. This is according to Satoshi's original vision. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:15:52
Did Corallo ever get that relay node set up in Beijing like he wanted? If not, then they aren't on the relay network. It's been a problem. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:57:24
The flip side of your argument is that Mycelium employs exactly Satoshi's stated strategy in their wallet which allows a trader to simply analyze the degree of propagation of his TX as a proxy for safety. The more years that go by I continue to be amazed at all the implementations that have been employed that satoshi had to forecast, one other being the vast array of SPV clients.

@_date: 2015-12-18 01:12:20
Why? The BTC only exist to be used.  the assets require btc TX's which pay fees. That's good. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:53:23
yep, and i would never lie to you:
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:20:19
Well, there are many who believe that by allowing Bitcoin itself to scale, there would be no need for SC's. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:24:15

the Blockstream devs don't get the bigger picture.  i've even been around longer than some of them and i see alot of fear.
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:36:14


then why do guys like Adam and many other 1MB'ers constantly coo about how few XT nodes there are based on Bitnodes data?
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:24:48
Don't worry about them. They can't hold bitcoin hostage. 
@_date: 2015-06-21 20:55:18
Wrong 
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:20:22
the young also will make their choices based on what is easier and more efficient.  they also make their choices based on what fits into the existing paradigm which today is the Internet.  which is why millennials find Bitcoin more compelling.  most of the objections i hear about Bitcoin today are from the older generations.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:58:01
i agree.  that's good for miners.
but also good for full node hobbyists b/c the exchange price will skyrocket due to al the demand from use cases such as Overstock.
plus, eventually there's pruning and IBLT.
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:21:04

WTF kinda ad hom is that?  elaborate on your slander.  if anything, your disingenous ongoing remarks are an attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:52:28
Adam is co-founder and President of Blockstream with $21M riding on his back expecting at minimum 10x returns. That's a lot of pressure. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:41:12
of course, it makes sense!
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:17:49
Agreed. However, entered my gold a couple of days ago and his attitude was one of complete entrenchment in his views despite a lot of back lash from many bright economic thinkers *and* devs. It doesn't look too bright for Jeff's proposal. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:53:25


this part i agree with; everything else, not.  i'll bet you're a 1MB block proponent too.
your problem is you've grown up within the Keynesian system, known nothing else, and probably benefitted greatly from it.  Bitcoin scares you; and it should.  for it to have survived over 6yr with a price at $225 must be perplexing to say the least.  more likely aggravating and threatening as hell.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:18:18
yeah, that's my guess.
the spiking on Bitnodes is getting quite high; like 30 TPS right now
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:09:15
80-90% IS overwhelming. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:53:49

Fantastic perspective. I hadn't even thought of that one before. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:55:22
if it was false, those miners would have issued a statement to that effect by now.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:32:51


by muted, i mean similar to what it is now; which is not that unacceptably high by my definition.
my expectation in an unlimited block system is that miners will inch up the sizes of their blocks over time so as to limit the orphan rate.  no miner will outsize their risk by producing such a large block that deviates from the average so as to not risk an orphan.  this risk will most likely be born by smaller newer miners trying to get into the game by grabbing market share and tx fee revenue from the big miners less willing to take risk.  this is how it is in competitive systems.  it'll be like a thousand minnows eating away at the big whales as mining distributes across the world leveraging superior BW's in the West.  this will decentralize mining away from China.
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:14:22
that's what i do.
and please tell us how RBF would affect your strategy of allowing your customers inhouse to immediately spend their 0 conf tx's?
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:57:28
Same for mining 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:45:54
but if the pool miner democratically doles out a version of getblocktemplate, individual hashers comprising the pool get to determine what goes into the block.

how so?  the OP is about filled blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:51:53

@_date: 2015-06-01 18:13:17
back up and ask yourself, what's wrong with hard forks?
assuming the new group of devs get along better and shed any financial conflicts of interest, hard forks based on an easier reached consensus, can actually allow Bitcoin to advance forward and keep up with evolving tech.  
we actually *want* it to hard fork from time to time to accomplish this.  don't let the doom and gloom crowd get you down.
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:04:09

@_date: 2015-06-19 16:07:20
yeah, but some *way* more than others.  
Pieter, Greg, Adam thru Blockstream is the most serious ($21M worth plus stock options) whose financial products have the potential to radically change Bitcoin or even deprecate it in favor of a dominant sidechain.

BIP100 is now off the table. As in scrapped. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:20:18
At the end of the day, you have to realize you're not in a technical argument but a political one. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:09:37
how would you respond to the vast majority of us in the community who have cold storage wallets that could be forced to migrate to a SC that becomes dominant?  your WP says as much.  IOW, the fear is that would cause those coins to massively devalue in the rush to transition.  in fact, perhaps completely if the owners don't find out about it until too late.  this assumes that scBTC will be traded on exchanges which i guarantee you they will be.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:36:30

massive discrepancy btwn that link and Tradeblock TPS.  any explanation?

this is so important to understand in the block size debate.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:40:25
He emphasizes wallet providers but it is much more than that. Entire concepts and platforms like Counterparty, colored coins, Factom, even Nasdaq or NYSE, that embed data into OP_RETURN will get screwed from high TX fees as we bump up against the limit. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:23:50
by failing to give a counter proposal and doing nothing, it is effectively the same thing.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:16:15
yes, we will incrementally solve problems as they come along.  w/o being able to foresee the future, this is how it has to be.  
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:13:21
Maybe, but it would be the ultimate in decentralization. We should make the attempt. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:19:56
I see logarithmics. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:24:32
No. That's Jeff's proposal. We've had nothing from blockstream which is really pissing off a lot of people. Please get your facts straight. I don't mean to be pejorative on that; this debate takes a LOT of concentration and effort due to the long ongoing grind so you have to be accurate. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:25:36
it's b/c ppl like you why we don't get anywhere.  or maybe that's the pt.

that's certainly always a possibility altho i don't have many bitcoins at all, if any ;)  all of us, esp BS has a financial motivation and to sweep that under the rug is ignorant also.  money is a powerful motivator and clouds ppl's objectivity.  this is such a deep and intertwined issue that touches on many areas that go all the way back to when i first got involved in 2011.  many issues i'm sure you're not even aware.  
your assumption that inc blocksize causes centralization via dec full nodes has been counter argued everywhere across Reddit and BCT.  are you reading them?  i think it's wrong.  inc blocks--&gt;inc users--&gt;inc full nodes from ppl protecting their investment.  this leverages an understanding of ppl's motivations based on the analyzers experience in many diverse areas of economics, tech, etc.  
i have read gmax's presentation on CT.  interesting but it's also a rule in crypto not to write your own crypto system which is why NIST competitions exist.  so i'm skeptical but that's the cautiousness speaking.
there's also the issue of how 80-90% of the community has voted in at least 3 separate polls to increase blocks.  they are the one's who have poured millions into funding these devs and are saying they want Bitcoin to scale and spread out.  i think the more user's we get worldwide is the real decentralization we should be seeking, not necessarily more full nodes.  that's focusing on the wrong metric.  Metcalfe's Law will square with user growth.  that's how you get more security and decentraliz.  
these are not even my complete arguments, it goes so deep.
finally, have you been following the Stress test, Tradeblock analyses, increasingly filled blocks on BC, &amp; Gavin's analyses?
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:41:48


think carefully about this.  even if one guy controlled the code, by virtue of the fact that it is open source allows the entire community to fork away from him if he violates the fundamental tenets of the system.

that assumes that we don't have latent elastic demand for Bitcoin usage in the equilibrium btwn cost and security.  i contend that if we open up the blocks to more users resulting in tx growth, paradoxically you will see full node counts *increase* in parallel resulting in just_as_much security as we have today as the mkt realizes Bitcoin is truly realizing its long term potential to become a global money on the order of Visa.

and, as you say, a form of centralized monetary policy by Blockstream core devs, that favors full node owners over users and miners.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:03:54
According to Blockstream, your centralized move would lead you to be decentralized. As long as you are offchain! 
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:56:21
but it's also possible, as outlined in the SC WP, that Bitcoin itself would be deprecated in favor of a dominant, more useful SC thus forcing all cold wallets to have to migrate over to that SC.  those who had the inside knowledge or head start in that instance stand to make billions.

and your evidence, again?
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:12:23
was the "book" that got inserted into the blockchain back when b/c a certain miner included that non-std tx into his own self generated block?
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:45:57
Noos, have you read the comments showing how a last min increase would cause chaos even if they could identify a crisis time down to the minute?
it has to do with lead time and allowing everyone, esp merchants and users, to upgrade *before* a problem hits.  they, unlike hodlers, are afterall the ones executing tx's *everyday* and don't have the luxury of sitting back and watching which chain to eventually follow.  you'll get forks which results in vulnerabilities for double spends.
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:39:57
and why do you ignore much more comprehensive reports from guys that have data analysis nodes hooked up around the internet for such analyses?
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:22:43
the way i understand the BIP process is that the other core devs can "revert" the BIP's accessibility?

and the only sensible ones to determine that fee prioritization are the miners who have their own proprietary internal tracking methods.  they are also the ones having to directly "negotiate" those fees with users. this is not something that core dev should be involved with at the protocol level as they are not in the economic feedback loop and would otherwise get involved in picking winners and losers.

geeks aren't in concensus on this debate.  just about 8 of them as far as i can tell.  there are many of them who would love to become a new group of core devs for XT.  and there are plenty of talented ones to do that.  
i AM advocating for decentrz with bigger blocks.  that's what a worldwide group of new users will do to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-06-26 14:51:27


That is not part of Gavin's proposal. The doubling is automatic. Only the initial move to 8MB requires miners to insert a versioning number into their blocks as an indication they are onboard with Gavin's plan. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:08:13
i don't think you understand what is happening here.
the XT and Core blockchains will be the same.  at least initially until someone starts producing &gt;1MB blocks which builds upon what you already have.  nothing changes except for how you client will handle a couple of unrelated situations and for the increased block size.
@_date: 2015-12-19 20:13:39

So if I say, and more importantly Gavin says, we don't like SC's. By your definition, we don't have a consensus on inserting a protocol change. Therefore, you would agree SC's should not be inserted, correct?

I've had a number of great conversations with him and he has taught me lots but I've always had this weird feeling he doesn't quite get the economics behind Bitcoin. After all, he admits he didn't get Bitcoin until mid 2013. That's 2.5 years after I got it. That's what's weird to me.

the flipside of this argument is that there are 9 (NINE) Blockstream core devs that Wlad relies on and who are the most active committers on the team.  that is a *lot* of voices who can derail a discussion to sway his opinion.

The point is not to have to code it in. Let the miners choose to up version code if they see enough positive internal data to justify it. Devs need to stay out of these market decisions.

that's a great question.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:30:53
Just because the opportunity exists for competition doesn't mean they don't realize that they have a huge head start that could prove insurmountable on the development of SC's that they can also, to some degree, modulate with their control of core dev. 
You are correct that no one will force people to use SC's but let me pose this question. Their spvp model depends on a fork. If Gavin decides to veto it, given that some of the blockstream devs have said 100% consensus should be required for the block size increase, should Blockstream be OK with the veto? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:23:00
or they will just more likely leave Bitcoin from lost confidence.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:04:33

@_date: 2015-06-16 14:14:40
market perceptions that Bitcoin can't or won't (as in consciously refusing due to a few obstructionists) scale.  Bitcoin is currently not a threat at 1MB.
@_date: 2015-06-17 13:43:12
Although I haven't heard any specifics, I'd bet Gavin would be lead and they'd bring in a new cadre of core devs. Quite frankly, that could be a good thing.

@_date: 2015-06-20 19:19:46
I can tell you're new. Gavin has been trying to develop consensus on a block size increase for 3y. He's being blocked by financial conflicted interests within core dev.
He's merely offering a choice with XT. If you don't like it, don't use it. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:29:18


so correct
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:31:25
wrong.  he has been discussing this with them for at least 3y.  also, there is endless discussion on BCT about raising the limit.  and, they foresaw just this roadblock.
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:02:41

Yes, and you bring up an excellent point; being able to plan is key. Just like we all have been able to "plan" for block halvings. Now we can plan for block doublings. Sounds kinda symmetric to me. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:45:18
He won't be that stupid. He'll say things like, "no one says SC's are bad, I'm just not sure we need them just right now, let's do more testing on Testnet, what about this thing needing merge mining, that doesn't sound safe, 51% attack, what about this high friction peg, gvts aren't going to like all this privacy, hmm sounds like inflationary to me. 
You know those kind of things. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:13:50
That may be, but by the mere fact that they have to be up 24/7, if it wants to provide micro TX's, and the fact that there are by definition many fewer hubs, means they can be attacked or driven offline with just a DOS makes them more centralized. Otherwise, they could just function as regular full nodes. 
Look, I don't want to dwell on LN because, as I said, my main issue is with SC's, not LN. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:50:17
Because it requires a rush to move over. First ones over win. Don't forget that each chain will have its own price on exchanges. Once the market gets the sense that one chain is going to be dominant, it will sell off the other. The SC guys claim the 2wp will allow seamless arbitrage. I think not because it is in fact not seamless and your coins get locked up for at minimum 2 days waiting for confirmation of the pass through. During that lock up prices can diverge wildly. The SC can even fail. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:05:21
a purist would say yes.  but in reality, what's the likelihood that any single datacenter will get shutdown going after Bitcoin?  it would have to be a worldwide coordinated event as most vps providers are spread out in several different jurisdictions.  this is unlikely to happen at this pt.

there's no such thing.  think of all the merchants executing tx's everyday that won't hear of or even know about a sudden upgrade at the last minute.  many, many double spends will be the cost.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:24:31

How do LN fees help miners? 
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:22:56


not true.  the only ones able to get away with that were the few % of tx's that could fit into the small space set aside in the code for 0 fee tx's.  everyone else had to pay the minfee which is around 0.0001BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:38:14
I think that's a strange argument. Yes, most of mining is currently in China. But with bigger blocks, higher bandwidth countries outside of China will now be able to compete for mining. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:43:45


sounds like IBLT. how does it really work ELI5?  why can't this be implemeneted at the p2p level too or does it demand direct, static, less dynamic connections vs p2p nodes?


yep.  read that.  very complex.  but i got the gist of it tho i couldn't verify the math.  those large gateway nodes that he inferred were run by large pool miners; are they vulnerable in your opinion?  he makes it sound as if they are...


i think you are right.  it's amazing to me all the armchair experts, incl core devs, who go on about this w/o precise info, like the rest of us.  it's amazing that after 3 full decades of internet there is still so much to learn about how it behaves at a real statistical level.


that's is a very interesting view.  i know, so much capability we don't even understand.  we need more academically-oriented core devs involved who have the ability to run simulations with deep statistical analyses and understanding.  hopefully those who can also see the big picture of what Bitcoin really means.


wouldn't a 1000 full nodes joining it make the relay network less attackable so as to merge it's resilience to that of the p2p?

@_date: 2015-06-24 05:03:57
no they won't give up their positions; if they can help it.
in case you hadn't noticed, they started hedging about a month ago by moving their own goal posts by saying "nobody is opposed to a block size increase".  notice the double negative which hints their true intent of opposition but with the hedge that if it goes thru they can say all along that they were *for* it and stay in their core dev positions.

hey, i was watching Tradeblocks mempool during yesterday's block attack and i didn't see a spike in it.  did you?  if so, i would argue that is a sign that it wasn't spam; increasing unconf tx's is the whole point of a spam attack.

that's really not true.

That's not what is meant by benevolent dictator. If Gavin becomes lead of XT, I'm sure he will appoint a new team of core devs, assuming the others stay behind on Core. He won't develop in his own. He would only act as a dictator if or when it became necessary in some urgent situation kinda like we have now.

@_date: 2015-06-14 20:52:24
We're talking about a company whose main product is sidechains who has every financial motivation to push TX's offchain to sidechains so they can collect lucrative consulting fees. To the extent they keep screaming about increasing centralization to full nodes as a straw man against raising block sizes, it's extremely relevant. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:40:22
this just shows you don't understand money.
Bitcoin can't be a "gold std" while it's use is relegated to a small number of primarily geek users.  only until it is used by most ppl worldwide (as in maximum user decentralization) can it become secure, resilient enough to withstand gvt attack.  if that happens, you will see an explosion in the price to levels we all anticipate.  
but if you hamstring it into a little 1MB relatively unused niche use, it will wither and die as it's value gets siphoned off to SC's or LN.
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:12:23
superior BW in the West will allow faster relay of bigger blocks; something that China can't seem to do for the time being b/c of their GFW.  this will encourage competition.

why would they do this when they haven't ever in the past despite 3 clear opportunities to have done so (BTCGuild, ghash, &amp; Artforz's pool)?  in a Nash Equilibrium, which i would argue governs mining dynamics, individual mining pools understand that if they individually go for the quick profits (the blonde) of a 51% attack to buy themselves a cup of coffee, not only will the individual attacking pool lose but they all end up losing.  the individual attacking pool will immediately lose as their ephemeral individual hashing clients, and everyone else in the community shun them in retribution thus destroying their biz and forcing losses of millions of USD of hardware:


even if it doesn't turn out to be the case, why couldn't we just back off the block limit from 20MB back down to 10MB if need be?  the point is to try to decentralize the network as far and wide as possible b/c i'm not confident in the non-tested skeptical claims that it can't be done given how tech has progressed in the past and what we've been able to accomplish in 20 yrs of internet that most of us never dreamed of.  i also don't trust the claims of conflicted parties.
i don't want to trust 3rd party offchain institutions.  i'd rather transact on a widely decentralized trustless network, not some small pigeon-holed geek project which is currently centralized primarily in the US &amp; Europe.

Welcome to the crowd. And I'll bet the down votes cone without any rebuttals for the most part. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 04:54:20
where did that discussion take place?  link?
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:46:12
strong argument there, dude.
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:48:30
b/c the miners and users are incapable of establishing a fee mkt?
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:39:32
If you can't acknowledge that 9 of the most active commiters and most vocal of Core being founders of one for profit company is a potential conflict of interest, that's a non starter. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:44:58
they're all in favor of Gavin's parameters.  they just would like to see them on Core instead of XT.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:28:22
or speculation
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:54:55
that's easy.  no one b/c they aren't invested in Facebook.
whereas all full node owners are invested in Bitcoin and understand that by doing so they will increase the exchange price.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:35:44


that's easy: Money
and a whole lot of education and perspective on the finances and economics of Bitcoin.  
see if you can find any other threads that have gone on longer than since 8/9/11:  
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:21:10
you should follow the discussion in here. as i suspected, it's all in the eyes of the beholder how Bitcoin scales O( n^2 ) vs O( n^2 log n ):
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:59:13
Correct 
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:08:56
so that would be a good thing and the network would adapt, not to mention the market, in a positive way.
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:18:01
if someone keeps their 8333 closed with 8 connections, don't they at least still *relay* tx's and blocks?
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:52:16


you make my pt.  they do, but users don't.
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:37:21
Bitstamp too but I only know this because they keep favoriting my tweets on this issue. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:25:41
the financial conflicts have now become clear with this release.  those who have said that the Blockstream devs have been stalling are now shown to be correct.  they have been saying that sidechains were not for scaling but now they're selling this?:
"The project has been heralded as a potential solution to bitcoin's perceived scalability issues for its attempt to enable experimentation on bitcoin's code."
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:06:10
yes they would.  if you need to throttle it, i've heard you can use QoS on your router.
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:53:37
In other words, armchair logic. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:40:44
so is the idea behind the spam attack in that tx is that it takes so many many sigops to confirm the tx that a miner simply avoids including it in a block?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:55:02
i didn't hear it either.  pretty much has to happen though.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:56:18
This is good news. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:06:37
even if it did, it won't be turned on until enough users have downloaded the new client to make it safe to do so.  this is the right approach.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:19:07
Blacklists will never get traction. We've already has several failed attempts. No gvt will unilaterally destroy their Bitcoin capability. Big bitcoin businesses will block it. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:42:48
which is possible and why we need to eliminate it.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:39:38
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:31:45


i disagree.  allowing Bitcoin to spread worldwide should bring enormous tx volume with corresponding large fee volume.


bigger blocks allow Western miners to push the edges of BW tech and superiority allowing much more decentralization than we have now.  why are you happy with 60% hashing in China now?


i've been around just as long as you.  i don't remember any signif incidents at all.  certainly none that took the volume up to 1MB levels thus validating theory on equilibrium.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:47:04

@_date: 2015-06-27 19:28:53


whoa there buddy! ;)  not sure how you're jumping so far ahead.  i'm just starting to reread that Tradeblock analysis which i agree is excellent and will get back to you when i get a chance.  got a wedding to go to for the rest of day, so maybe tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-06-12 21:04:03
yes, and the editing
@_date: 2015-06-13 02:10:26
or it just means that the miners will have to throttle back any large that encounter delays.  this would encourage smaller more efficient blocks which would negate the "large miner, large block attack vs small miners" that the 1MB crowd throws around.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:47:09
back in the dsy was a heavy, heavy shill for Ripple. We had some long long battles on BCT about centralization. I've proven to be right as Ripple has revealed itself badly earlier this year and is now totally off the crypto currency radar. He's a stubborn one. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:47:45
1 MB fanatics are getting desperate. 
Btw, prove it. And I categorically deny the accusation. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:31:22
let's back up a sec.  who are closed nodes connecting their 8 connections to?  i thought it was the major legacy nodes run by long time players like lukejr, sipa, etc.  now that i think about it, how can that be?  seems like even those legacy nodes would have a max 120 connections and would be maxed out from those ppl running closed full nodes, no?
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:28:42
A simple defensive move to this is to do what the Chinese miners are doing today when a large block comes in. Immediately start mining a headers only block with 0 TX's during the time you're validating the large block. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:24:29


i can't believe someone with your supposed knowledge would even say something like that.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:44:42
maybe you should consider Mike's proposal to pull commit access of the Core team?  if you felt it necessary to clean house and it would make it easier to implement the block increase rather than switching everyone to XT, i would support that.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:22:54
that's how badly the Blockstream financial conflict has forced this outcome.  there is a concerted effort by them to force tx's to their business model of sidechains.

@_date: 2015-06-01 16:31:06


that's describing what is happening in the most negative light.
while i agree in principle it would have been better to keep the Core designation, in the end, it's just a title that can be discarded with the drop of a hat.
@_date: 2015-12-01 02:20:05


why do you keep pushing this FUD?  
the largest miners are the Chinese who are stuck behind the GFC where they *can't* use a large block attack due to their poor bandwidth.  Wang Chun et al even told us this is the case.  which is why they SPV mine when we get full blocks even at small 1MB sizes.  plus, if you believe that FUD then you validate Peter_R's paper elucidating a blocksize equilibrium in the absence of a limit due to block propagation latency leading to orphans.
finally, no mining cartel is going to destroy Bitcoin to attack small miners.  it's a self defeating strategy.  otherwise they would've done it already.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:15:07
Of course you haven't bothered to assess my side of the story. But go on, keep on getting paid consulting fees by Blockstream. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:05:33
sorry, nothing in there tells me i'm using XT, afaict.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:10:07
that won't work b/c their servers are still on the main network and have to deal with the same unconf tx's that the rest of us do.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:12:29
they all burst
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:45:09
Andreas is right.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:59:10
very good.
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:01:19
Thanks, good to know. Stratum is awesome. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:52:42
Let's have your simulation testing and some math to back this up. An ELE? Calm down. 
Why would a miner want to destroy his business? We've never seen this type of attack in Bitcoin's history and lifting the cap isn't going to change the fact that miners won't want to destroy their primary business. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:52:11
Satoshi made it very clear Bitcoin was an economic experiment in the genesis block.  the tech is simply to enforce the rules of his original vision.  we should enforce that vision.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:56:54


i love the ad hominem.  surely even you can do better?
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:01:53
Dude, you are on fire! 
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:47:45
And when it's governed by a small group of people called core devs? 
@_date: 2015-06-13 03:04:47
you also left out the fact that any country making Bitcoin a safe haven benefits from an influx of Bitcoin companies taking advantage of that fact.  that would help their local economy greatly.
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:28:16


i have seen the system as it is today and core dev is being perverted by a financial conflict.
btw, i predicted a battle along the lines of improving Bitcoin back in the Spring when gmax announced the concept of sidechains and then again in October with their whitepaper.  i immediately voiced concerns about conflicts of interest.  this block limit debate has, imo, validated those concerns. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:29:42

@_date: 2015-06-13 06:26:04
Thanks again. That just reminded me. I need to go back over Gavin's posts to verify just how long he's been advocating for block size increases. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:04:21


why would they do this when they haven't ever in the past despite 3 clear opportunities to have done so (BTCGuild, ghash, &amp; Artforz's pool)?  in a Nash Equilibrium, which i would argue governs mining dynamics, individual mining pools understand that if they individually go for the quick profits (the blonde) of a 51% attack to buy themselves a cup of coffee, not only will the individual attacking pool lose but they all end up losing.  the individual attacking pool will immediately lose as their ephemeral individual hashing clients, and everyone else in the community shun them in retribution thus destroying their biz and forcing losses of millions of USD of hardware:


even if it doesn't turn out to be the case, why couldn't we just back off the block limit from 20MB back down to 10MB if need be?  the point is to try to decentralize the network as far and wide as possible b/c i'm not confident in the non-tested skeptical claims that it can't be done given how tech has progressed in the past and what we've been able to accomplish in 20 yrs of internet that most of us never dreamed of.  i also don't trust the claims of conflicted parties.
i don't want to trust 3rd party offchain institutions.  i'd rather transact on a widely decentralized trustless network, not some small pigeon-holed geek project which is currently centralized primarily in the US &amp; Europe.  


did you view the results of the Stress Test yesterday?

sort of as they're trying to overload full node memory
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:32:43
sidechains will steal tx fees from the main blockchain.  how does that help?  the answer isn't merge mining also as sidechains will never have 100% the security of the mainchain.
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:45:33
The author is exactly right.

i realize that's Rusty's estimate but i hear others around 50%.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:52:38
And that's just a smear tactic from you as a Blockstream investor. 
Satoshi explicitly have Gavin the keys to be lead core dev when he left. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:32:45
how does this SPV support mechanism via full nodes work?  if an SPV wallet accesses a full node is the full node fully tied up during the query?  how long does that last, if so?   or can the full node service many SPV wallets simultaneously?   i suspect the latter, so in that case, how can you possibly draw any conclusions about needs?
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:07:18
This is a very pessimistic attitude that is a big part of the problem. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:42:21
Then I'll answer that for you. We do have an obligation to them otherwise Bitcoin is not a SOV and certainly not a "settlement system" like the 1MB'ers claim if they get their way. Bitcoin gets destroyed if SC's implement through the SPV proof. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:20:21
i luv it when you get like this ;)
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:46:26

Metcalfe's Law will square with the  not full nodes.  Nodes are just the ACH or Swift functionaries of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:01:17


it will as halving continues apace.  and that's a good thing.
Bitcoin is about free market forces incentivizing economic actors who, for the first time in history, have confidence in a sound money supply.  letting miners choose what they view as proper tx fee compensation for their proprietarily known costs should be allowed and encouraged.
i wouldn't worry about miner defection, aka Tragedy of the Commons, as their are plenty of economic actors waiting to come on board only awaiting a clear signal that Bitcoin is willing to grow.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:24:12

@_date: 2015-06-25 05:17:46
why go to the trouble?  it's not necessary.  i have posts all over the forum to that effect during that time.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:54:20
I haven't seen a counter proposal for a limit increase from the blockstream crowd. Link please. 
I doubt Gavin would do such a thing either. I'm just making a conceptual point that if he did disagree on inserting the spvp proof for good technical reasons, the blockstream folk should be perfectly fine with this, correct? Since their goal is consensus? 
Well, that's the thing, I don't think SC's are that good. I think that separating the value unit from its blockchain is a flawed economic concept along the lines of those who tout "it's the blockchain stupid". So if we understand the reasons why they may not be good, or even destructive to Bitcoin proper, shouldn't we prevent the insertion of the spvp? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:10:50
they WILL make Bitcoiner's rich by throughputting all those tx's that pay the minfee which currently is 0.0001BTC or higher.  
all that demand for BTC to throughput those tx's will drive the hell out of the exchange price.  plus, it will strengthen miners, which is exactly what they need right now as rewards diminish.
@_date: 2015-12-01 02:08:05
no, BTCNugget was the one who failed to upgrade their software and then mined an invalid block, upon which the subsequent 6 SPV blocks mined on top of it by primarily f2pool (4), and then Antpool (1), &amp; BTCC (1) failed to validate the invalid block and subsequently all 6 got forked off.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:17:05


well, making a statement like the above, you infer that anonymity is easily compromised.  my counter pt is that it's not.  otherwise we would have the answer by now as to who stole mtgox's coins, not to mention the dozens/hundreds of other thefts off of exchanges.
and as far as LN hubs. i don't like that they are heavily centralized due to their 24/7 requirement.  that exposes them to attack.  the great thing about full nodes is that they can dynamically come and go  yet have the ability to catch up to the current consensus. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:21:16
wow, thank you.
@_date: 2015-06-09 03:55:47


what does this mean then?
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:39:09
both those % imply either 60000 to 19000 full nodes.  
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:50:25
and that's a position authoritarians use to justify their actions.

oh look.  how quaint.  a real life CEO of one of our most successful and visionary companies in the space thinks *user growth* is important.  well, um, 1MB blocks:
*User adoption is the most important success factor for BitPay. Bitcore and Copay provide infrastructure that people can use to build new services and tools that ultimately increase Bitcoin adoption. The more Bitcoin users there are, the more valuable BitPay's business services become.*

@_date: 2015-06-09 23:11:31


what's your evidence this is happening and not ordinary users getting hung up with normal tx's?
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:40:20
It's better to say they get paid to verify TX's. That is consistent with the way they will need to get paid in the far future when block rewards go away. We need to think this way NOW which helps us focus on why we shouldn't support any scheme today that moves TX's off the main chain. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:05:17
They are guiding the evolution of Bitcoin, as in 1MB choking, to maximize the success of SC's and LN. It's clear as a bell. Which is why everyone can see it. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:27:22
Gavin's opinion had also been known for years. So why does act so shocked and surprised? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:01:32
it only makes sense.  how often have we heard complaints from the Russians and Chinese about USD hegemony?
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:07:49


sort of. it is a widely used metric of acceptance by the community of XT.  right now, it's still low at around 140-150 b/c there is no XT patch available yet cuz Gavin is still negotiating the 8MB BIP thru Core.
i have a bunch of Core nodes that i stand ready to convert once Gavin gives the go ahead.
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:13:15


that may be how it starts off but i think they now have to happen simultaneously.  i talk about this dynamic a lot here:
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:11:31




@_date: 2015-06-02 04:51:26
Satoshi was the best thing that ever happened to Peter Todd.
He can't defend himself.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:04:45
the way i see it is that if Bitcoin can't grow b/c of the Blockstream obstructionist behavior, confid tx's don't matter.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:10:43
you could very possibly be right.  the charts have clearly bottomed and we're slowly creeping up according to the cycles.
based on years of investing, price charts move entirely against the sentiment and news which confuses the hell out of investors.  like now for instance.  there doesn't appear to be any hope at resolution to this debate and sentiment and doubt about Bitcoin's future has never been higher, imo.  look at the Wlad post.  the fear and vitriol against a hard fork and Gavin has never been louder.  yet the price is moving up and the wall observers are heavily skewed towards a buy configuration.
this is actually the time to buy.  perhaps as your theory suggest, a big price increase might in fact be the catalyst to forcing a block size increase (altho i have my doubts).  but by ramping up tx's to the pt that blocks are continually filled and unconf tx's start piling up, enough anger and dismay may put enough pressure on core dev to actually make an increase.
but then of course, those guys will read this and get it in their heads to really dig their heels in and simply ascribe full blocks to *spam*.  anyhow, your thoughts are good.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:44:20
as i said somewhere else, all you need to know is that miners are NOT required to include all tx's presented to them.  they will self regulate the system so as to survive.  they have the ability to decide for themselves based upon what users are willing to pay and what will be profitable to them.
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:18:19
I know that. But the SPV proof for SC's requires a 100% consensus protocol change. Just like we have here in the block size debate. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:11:21
i'm pretty sure that's not the case.  there were lots of us.  we were still in early/middle GPU history.  my Avalons weren't delivered until Spring/Summer of 2013:  
and then i still solo'd until early 2014.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:44:01
it would be really nice if someone posted a simple tute about how to update to XT from Core in linux w/o having to re-download the entire chain.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:15:59
i'd argue that would be a good problem to have.
also, we wouldn't get spam attacks right away if we upgraded to 20MB tomorrow.  i highly doubt we'd get a spam attack up to 20MB worth b/c of the expense and the fact that it would just be enriching miners for the short term actually strengthening them which is the last thing an attacker spammer presumably would want to do.  plus, the network could chew through that attack much quicker making it much less effective.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:03:47


how much louder can i speak and take so many downvotes for doing so?
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:14:17
what we should want though is just one core dev who is expert with the code, has good intentions, and has history, to stand up and push the fork.  that would be Gavin.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:23:38
this is why i think you have to leave the fee mkt out of the protocol and let users and miners freely make this determination.
@_date: 2015-06-01 14:21:17
Fear? Blockstream? 
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:29:56
Again, they can't be as decentralized as a standard full node by definition. 
Like I said, I don't object entirely to the concept of LN since it's sort of on main chain. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:57:49
too much logic
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:55:35
the required standard min fee is .00001

b/c offchain tx's are by definition less secure and more centralized than onchain Bitcoin.  don't you remember, according to them, even as a 1MB choke, Bitcoin is their "settlement system".
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:28:55
Yeah, forgot about that. Sure hope they do this soon so that you guys can co-dev a great solution. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 03:10:55
it's all armchair logic
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:04:40
Blockstream has a financial incentive to force users to their solutions, LN &amp; SC's.
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:41:31
the orphan risk is likely to remain relatively muted as the profit incentives for miners in general will be to mine bigger and bigger blocks for greater and greater tx fees.  IOW, they are *likely* to accept and mine on top of bigger and bigger blocks as it then allows each of them in turn to mine bigger and bigger blocks for more fee revenue.  
and the overall reason this works in the first place is the immutable 21M coin supply which guarantees (if you believe in Bitcoin incentives of Sound Money) that the value of coins gained via mining will appreciate over time.  which they have ever since it's creation in 2009.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:25:51


show me
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:34:10
maybe b/c pwuille said it?  
but no, i don't rely just on that.  think about it.  if a successful 20MB SC ever got going, with the 2wp guarantee, everyone will just leave their BTC on the SC (i think of the 2wp as a pass thru).  through further use from the improved features and all the tx's and fees associated accumulating on the SC, eventually the MC (mainchain) will get deprecated, wither, and die.  this would force all those cold storage wallets to have to migrate to the SC.  THAT would be a disaster b/c presumably exchanges will have different pricing for the coin on either chain.  it would act as a transfer of wealth to the new SC "early adopters".  i think that type of instability would damage the  whole concept of cryptocurrencies as being a never ending ponzi scheme not to get involved with.
btw, are you still heavily involved with Ripple?
@_date: 2015-06-18 02:33:43
no, but they can use Bitcoin as a payment network.  which is what we want and need for maximum decentralization.  but they need to trust that it is cheap and reliable. 
and as far as them not having any gold.  at least some go to great lengths to get it:
 …
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:16:50
talk me thru that end decentralization logic again.  the one you tested.
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:34:33
I want cheap TX's to grow the userbase worldwide. That would be a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:24:08
that's called centralization.  that's bad isn't it?
@_date: 2015-06-02 01:35:50
given that Peter Todd and the other Blockstream devs are saying Satoshi made a mistake, would you blame him?
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:56:14
i seriously couldn't hear him well.  did he say Bitcoin is "broken" and "won't" change the world?
regardless, this guy is a hero.  being the legal owner of bitcoin.org back during the PressCenter.org debacle of the community vs &amp; Sirius personally intervened to say it was ok for Ver and Matonis to be listed on the site which had been hijacked by the devs and was being used for their political views.  kinda like today with Blockstream except we don't have anyone who can intervene like we did back then.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:49:17
Bitcoin only needs to be a settlement layer unto itself and no other. 
it can also be it's own payment network if we lift the cap.
on it's own it is the ideal money.
@_date: 2015-06-14 15:55:59
yes, it's surprising to me just how insightful the OP is.
i run many nodes but i don't bother to tx thru them.  not worth my effort b/c i DO have confidence in the rest of the p2p network.  but yes, if the  dropped drastically and the p2p network became insecure, yes, i'd have to start diverting my tx's thru one of my nodes.
but if i was a merchant, for sure.  which, btw, this OP is a great reason for merchants to run full nodes which would solve all our problems with this debate as they are the ones with the real incentive and revenue to do this.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:34:02
b/c the SC's will never equal the mainchain in hashing power, how does it defend itself from large miner 51% attacks esp when the miner or miners don't have anything to lose and perhaps much to gain (from a simultaneous short)?
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:56:39
i would like to propose a compromise.
let the Blockstream folks insert their SPV proof into source while simultaneously eliminating the block size limit according to Satoshi's original vision.  then we can see which Ferrari will go faster.
the network effect of sound money vs that of SC's (speculation).  it would be a fantastic test of the market.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:02:54


that will grow as the userbase grows from bigger blocks.
increasing miner fees and unconfirmed tx's as the limit keeps getting hit will turn off users en masse.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:09:56
i run my full nodes using vps's that are connected with the speediest connections out to the rest of the internet.  skeptics will argue that this is centralization.  i say c'mon.  there are so many cloud providers scattered round the world it would be hard for one gvt to shut them all down.  skeptics will then argue, "gvt collusion".  c'mon.  as long as  gvts have conflicts and wars, there should be some jurisdiction that will let Bitcoin run.  and that's all we need.

@_date: 2015-06-27 15:25:43
Blockstream discusses in their WP the potential for all Bitcoiners to have to migrate to a dominant SC.  how do you feel about that?  if that had to happen, it would result in massive losses to most BTC cold wallets and those involved early on in the SC would stand to inherit that wealth.  that would be disruptive and violate my vision of Bitcoin's network value and supposed ability to upgrade itself to any threat.  the fact that BS is objecting to such a simple block size increase acc to Satoshi's original vision has strengthened my suspicions of their true motivations that go all the way back to Oct 22, 2014 when they released their WP.  IOW, i predicted these types of financial conflicts would come up back then.
go to my gold thread and start reading forward from Oct 22, 2014 for lotsa debate on SC's.

@_date: 2015-06-12 22:19:30
i actually understand what the OP is saying.  in a sense, he's right.  b/c we can't ever know the future, which is what predicting the capabilities of technology involves, alot comes down to faith and incentives.
none of us here, incl and esp the core devs, predicted or conceived of Bitcoin.  in fact, a couple said it would fail.  one continues to be a bear.  so why should we trust their ability to predict the future.  esp when it comes to Metcalfe's or Moore's Law?  we should stick to Satoshi's original vision which was to take Bitcoin to Visa levels.
it's difficult to conceive just how much impact a new currency conceived of for the internet, of the internet, and by the internet will grow that same internet.  it's hard to imagine the multiplicative effect of instant worldwide tx's b/c we've never had that before.
i say we give Bitcoin a chance to stretch it's legs.  i'm sure it can go alot faster than any of us can imagine.

Yep, which of those two are wrong? 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:20:14
but the point is we're in the building stages of Bitcoin adoption.  turning new customers away thru initial bad experiences of unconf tx with delays is a bad way to achieve that.
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:06:13
interesting. what makes the relay network faster?  centralized high speed servers directly connecting pools?  it seems to me that the p2p wouldn't have to be *exactly* the same speed at confirmations as we somewhat have today.  just the credible threat of a fallback for pools even if it means the network has to slow down during an attack might be enough.  of course, data and simulations would be nice but those are hard b/c even they come with so many potentially false assumptions.  what do you think of Gavin &amp; Mike's claim that the network is actually O(mn) instead of O(n^2)?
also, what's stopping a few informed full nodes from jumping on the relay network as well?  i suspect nothing right?
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:13:17
correct.  
the network may be resilient but the users won't be.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:10:01
i sure hope you're right.  keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:11:28
but it's not usual to have to disagree with everything they say either.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:55:40


certainly you can see the contradiction there?  these same core devs are the ones criticizing Gavin for wanting *only* 75% versioning before turning the switch on for 8MB.  they're demanding 95% as being socially responsible which given how those things work, would take at least 6 mo to achieve.
so to argue, otoh, that oh we'll just code in an increase quickly and have everybody just upgrade instantly over zero time is unrealistic and reckless at best.

Why when its the miners themselves who get to choose to up version their software if they can internally justify it. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 15:51:03
yep, fees of 1x, 8x, or 20x potentially.  that expense increase is enough to discourage most attackers.  we'll just have to see if all the other factors that i and others have argued against such an extreme attack play out.  like simple game theory or the fact that the top 5 miners in the world are behind the GFC and already have poor connectivity that is essential to success of such an attack.
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:48:12
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:30:02
Totally agree. I have one running already and awaiting the go ahead from Gavin for the rest.

Do you have any idea how destructive that would be to everyone's wealth currently on the mainchain?

well, imo, what inc user growth will bring is inc merchant growth.  those merchants will be incentivized to run their own full nodes which should inc the capacity of the p2p network.  we'll see.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:39:21
that's easy. b/c by forcing cold wallets to switch constantly btwn "better" coins will destroy the SOV/saving function that Bitcoin has so far established.  transitions from better coin to better coin will cause massive losses for those lagging cold wallets or those who don't hear about the change (not everyone follows these forums).  that would reduce the whole concept of cryptocurrencies to that of a continuous rolling Ponzi scheme that will destroy faith in the entire concept of a sound money.

i agree that in theory, if SC's were perfect 2wp's with 100% MM, then they could be used as research tools.  but with Bitcoin being already almost perfect money, there might at most be 2 SC's that i would use: fast tx's and anonymity.  beyond that, i don't see a need for anymore.
enter Blockstream. they have a financial incentive to sell all sorts of speculative SC's that enable long term asset speculation like stocks, bond, insurance, even gvt currencies.  this isn't debatable; they've said this is what they want to do.  therefore, given that the Bitcoin network can and should only be MM'ing those 2 utility chains for fast tx and anon, the rest will be insecure.  
then why make them?  b/c the $21M in investment money needs a 10x return.  on top of that, Blockstream has an incentive to make these speculative SC's attract as many BTC as possible; otherwise these clients will be unhappy they paid for them in the first place.  this is an existential risk to Bitcoin as it destroys its sound money function.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:01:13

@_date: 2014-09-05 16:51:00
no.  see here the comparative cost advantages of Bitcoin mining:  
the "costs" you're referring to inappropriately includes block rewards.  that is not a cost.  that's just the distribution mechanism of the coins which will be made up by increasing tx fees with time.  
and your focus on the price is inappropriate as that is for the most part a speculative game that has it's own peculiar emotional waves of peaks and troughs that have nothing to do with the underlying technology.
the exponential hashrate is a good indication of how well Bitcoin is doing as ppl continue to believe in its long term prospects.  eventually, the price will have to follow it up.

@_date: 2015-12-01 10:58:47
This is correct and is why Chinese miners have specifically said they can't handle anything larger than 8MB right now. It's also why I think they SPV mine so much to keep up with the relay network primarily outside of China.

no, you said they aren't interested in money.
therefore, to avoid any allegations of financial impropriety like they are getting now, they should not have *formed* Blockstream of their own volition.  formed by gmax, btw.
AND, they shouldn't accept consulting fees for clients who consult with them.
AND, they should not accept stock and options which stand to increase orders of magnitude if they are successful.

We're going through the expected phase of economic growth via wages and sales.

well yeah.  assuming for a moment (short moment) that your guy actually did this, he's met you in person face to face, presumably.  and he lives near you enough to know the trucks address.  and he'd be stupid enough to jeopardize your relationship with him.
that is an entirely different situation than here on Reddit where no one knows who you are, let alone seen your face.  let alone follow you just for posting shit.
besides, if you really are creeped out about reusing accts, which is an entirely different thing from reusing Bitcoin addresses, i don't want to see you post ever again here on Reddit using your current name beyond this thread.  remember, you don't want to reuse your name.

i think the problem is that they've identified the wrong fundamental unit in the system.  as geeks, they identify with the full node as that unit.
otoh, the economic majority identifies the user as that fundamental unit, which i think is correct.  Metcalfe's Law will work off the user who needs cheap, reliable tx's to be onboarded.
and the full node and user are not mutually exclusive.  increasing users will result in increasing nodes.

if one makes an effort to dabble in as many of the bucket spaces as defined, one can easily see that the entire space is growing.  levels in all buckets are rising in aggregate but some faster than others along with occasional pullbacks (price).  i made the decision early on to buy BTC, run a biz (newsletter), mine, and participate in a merchant biz. there is definite growth throughout the space.  it's easily visible and palpable if you're willing to get in there and dig.  
at the same time, understanding the math behind the tech is critical. oftentimes, when the price gets down like this, i go study.  and then i feel better.

@_date: 2014-11-20 17:41:25
from my gold thread:
i went back thru Satoshi's whitepaper to see if there were any references to any of the speculative SC's functions that are being proposed by the SC proponents in this thread and elsewhere.  those being listed below.  they claim that SC's are a "natural and logical extension" to Bitcoin and that if Satoshi was able to be asked, he would love SC's.  well, i see no indication that this wild claim is valid.  see that none of these speculative assets were ever mentioned:
0 asset
0 stocks
0 bonds
0 insurance
0 smart
0 contracts
0 sidechain
0 offchain
0 separate
2 gold
5 **money**
it's clear to me that Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be a new form of digital money, or currency if you will, that mimicked gold in all respects and improved upon it.  i'm only aware of one isolated forum post where he mentioned the addition of smart contracts, etc but that was in the context of adding them to the MC protocol.  never was there any mention of SC's nor the quack idea of separating the BTC units from the blockchain.  and understandably so.  by breaking the inextricable link btwn the two, you break security and therefore break Bitcoin as Money.  this is so obvious.  the last 200 pages have clearly demonstrated a myriad of ways things can go wrong with the SC proponents morphing their vision of how SC's will play out to satisfy any specific concern while promising us the moon.
Bitcoin should continue to focus on what got us to where we are:  the Money function.  that is where the problem lies today in the world of fiat and central banks.  this is what i saw back in January of 2011, Bitcoin as a poison dart aimed at the heart of central banks.  the problem is not stocks, bonds, insurance, contracts.  those all function reasonably well.  the problems we've had with them in the past, such as in 2001 and 2008, were fiat printing enabled and backed by central banks.  w/o the ability to print at will to bail out bad actors, Bitcoin as Money seeks to clamp down and eliminate this moral hazard.  and the network of money is ripe to be disrupted.  and rightfully so.  THAT is where the money is.  the Forex is the biggest in the world as i've shown.  the gold market is huge as well.  if Bitcoin can crack those markets we will go to the Moon.  Bitcoin should stay simple and non complex.  it has evolved to that of a public good.  no one should be allowed to corrupt its primary function of money.  let alone profit off it.  
leave the source code alone.

furthermore, i think you underestimate the adaptability of Bitcoin's code.  it will be able to adapt most innovations that come along which will strengthen it.  also, it will be very hard for any other cryptocurrency to come along and unseat Bitcoin at this point.  there is just too many investors and big money players on board for any of them to switch.  it would have to be something radically different.  there's absolutely nothing on the horizon that fits that bill.

it's the money printing from the CB's that facilitates the whole process.  if they were constrained, all the speculation and debt issues would be capped at reasonable levels.  the problem is that banks and speculators have figured out that the CB's will back them up in their failed investments regardless of the cost to ordinary citizens.

the best way to have handled this, imo, would have been to impose an across the board sales tax to be collected by every Bitcoin merchant.  that would have reduced the potential audit space considerably and made it much less than the hydra it already is.

FYI, as my own test, I've been walking around with a fair number of coins in my cold storage address for months and nothing has happened despite reusing it and exposing the public key.

yes, Bitcoin can never become a true form of money without privacy.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:37:16
so where is the time savings then if the miner still has to wait for the actual tx's to arrive before starting to hash the next block?
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:57:02
you have to see the whole picture.
of course it's volatile.  it's only 5 yrs old.  do you seriously expect it to come out of the box fully stable, fairly valued, liquid, and understood?
he can't comment on Bitcoin's future unless he understands how Bitcoin works.  we're in a dynamic growth phase that includes volatility created by the tension btwn those who understand and those who don't.  observing a small slice of time right now and coming to the conclusion Bitcoin won't work just b/c it's volatile is ludicrous.

A motivated non economic attacker will wait until i estimate 20-30% of bitcoins accumulate on a sidechain before initiating an attack. Bitcoin already has a perceptual problem with its fixed supply. Now figure out how the market would react to a loss of that percentage of bitcoin. I'd bet, very negatively and could kill Bitcoin as an unworkable too deflationary intense form of money. The attack will come because the security is only based on merged mining. Furthermore, the frozen bitcoin in transit will be trapped. From everything I've heard about the theory it requires time to move bitcoins back and forth as in days. By definition again, this involves economic risk and therefore a diminished value when they come out the other side. 
The only reason anyone would want to move bitcoin to a sidechain is for the prospect to make money. Therefore the prospect of losing money has to equally be a possibility. There is no peg. If you send 10 bitcoin to a sidechain and there is a problem, expect to pony up extra cash or more bitcoin to get that same 10 bitcoin back, if at all if the sidechain fails. 
Adam did miss the boat. Listen to his Letstalkbitcoin podcast interview. . 
I don't think bitcoins should be allowed to leave its system. They're integral and a fundamental part of the Bitcoin protocol. You'll gut the system if you lose too many on a sidechain. They are not an app layered on top of the protocol like Andreas likes to say. They're more than that. They are Bitcoin and what gives transactional value to the entire system. That's my economic intuition.

The problem here is that Bitcoin has been and always will be different things to different people. For me, it's always been a speculative process mining for an asset. Just because the IRS never asked for public opinions from people like me, doesn't mean their definition is correct. To even think they would get it right the first time is naive.

@_date: 2014-03-31 13:29:59
You have no idea what you're talking about.
From my perspective, mining had always been a speculative investment. I invest in hardware and hope and pray it returns my costs before it ever makes a profit.
The IRS acts like profit is always a certainty and that it will always be a certainty going forward. Who the hell knows? Has everyone forgotten the phrase that Bitcoin could still go to zero? The lead dev Gavin always reminds people of this.
The true litmus test for this i s the economic reaction you'll see in the market place. A good indication is that from Megabigpower. My bet is they pack up and leave the US. Why not? Most large miner centers already foresaw this and set up outside the US. Many of us never sold mined coins because we look at them as a long term investment that allows us to trade USD for Bitcoin

But you do realize that Bitcoin has to stay private if it is to function as a true form of money.

thanks for affirming my fears for what might happen with Sidechains; failure and entrapment of BTC equivalents on a Sidescam never to return.
i view your examples as entirely different than what you're proposing with Sidechains.  those were all random accidental losses.  none had support from a core dev like yourself and were models not technically linked to the Bitcoin network. in the many non-technical discussions i've heard about Sidechains, ppl are not even remotely aware that they can lose coins.  ppl are envisioning a riskless system where their coins are zooming unhindered back and forth btwn various chains. that risk has not been discussed enough.
also, are you still not going to be financially entertwined in any way with Adam Back's for-profit company that is behind all of this?  it appears Adam's company is getting preferential tx here compared to MasterCoin, CP, Bitshares, no?
Sidechains are an entire eco-subsystem which is proposing to hitch itself and its fortunes onto the Bitcoin network in a technical manner.  frankly, i see it as leeching off Bitcoin's security from what are very likely to be merge mining security proposals despite your assertions that it will be otherwise.  if not, i fail to see how they will secure themselves.
an excessive loss of BTC on any Sidescams will be devastating to Bitcoin.

It kinda crept up on us non financial guys. I spent the 90's with my nose to the grind stone trying to build up my business. The nasdaq crash I barely remember. That was caused by Greenspan. Then came 2008. By that time I was really focused. I had bought a bunch of gold and silver in 2005 in preparation. I could not believe the behavior of idiots like Bernanke, Paulson, and Geithner. Those 3 should have gone to prison for all the money they stole from Americans. They will go down in history infamously. That experience prepared me well to recognize instantly what bitcoin was in 2011. Well, not that instant as I missed what I saw in 2009. Bitcoin is the great savior and is what I had been waiting for as the perfect investment for over 25 years. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:43:27
i'm familiar with the abstraction that a wallet provides in the client when it comes to addresses vs. UTXO's in the protocol. an address's balance is just the sum of it's UTXO's sent to that address (hash160).  so this watching only function *will* work if no spending ever occurs from the address.
in Armory, if i spend some of the UTXO's, those are removed from the watching only balance correctly.  you're saying this isn't happening in the upgrade?

the way i understand the stealth address is that it's displayed visibly on a merchants website and you need to grab that to enter into your client to both generate a deterministic real address and a nonce.  both get sent to the merchant.
so the stealth address (seed) must look similar to a real address and i'd like to see what it looks like.  it's also meant to be reused.

I'm tired of hearing Andreas say that Bitcoin the currency is the first app layered on the blockchain. This implies you can afford to lose it and still be fine because you'd still have the underlying blockchain. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. Bitcoin the currency *is Bitcoin*. You lose those fundamental units to something like a sidechain and you lose the entire Bitcoin network including the blockchain and Bitcoin will be destroyed.

*i think the anonymity part of BTC should be downplayed.  sure its a symbol for the geek network as well as the illegal trade folks but won't be for the masses who are the critical part of this acceptance equation.  the best way to think of how BTC will be used in the future is to study M-Pesa in Kenya and why it took off like a rocket shot.  those ppl just needed an easy, inexpensive way to move money around the country w/o physically delivering it like they had been (donkey ride cross country) forced to do b/c of theft.  they don't care that Safaricom/Vodafone knows their identity when sending money; they just want to get the money to family and friends.  most of BTC use will be this way.*

@_date: 2014-04-18 10:31:47
I'll take the cautious side here being a stake holder in Bitcoin. Not being a dev my concerns are purely theoretical and mostly economic.
1. In general, a for profit company with a low to no stake in Bitcoin should not be trusted to make changes to the protocol that facilitate its profit making. Especially if it's gone out and hired core devs and comes at the expense of the competition.
2. I would like to know who these core devs are supposedly supporting the whole concept besides gmax who has gone on record saying Bitcoin needs to be "fixed". I don't understand the secrecy as I've asked for those names several times. I for one don't think Bitcoin needs fixing.
3. I've always conceptualized Bitcoin as being a self contained financial system so I am concerned that it's fundamental value units will be allowed to leave its system destined for what will inevitably be a weaker sidechain from a security standpoint. In that sense I don't see them as "the first app" overlaying the protocol like Andreas likes to say. I see them as fundamentally integrated into the network. Invariably, whatever token your bitcoin is transformed into will be worth less as a result.  We've spent 5 long years distributing those bitcoins throughout the blockchain in a fair and truthful manner based on free market trading. $600 million has been irreversibly spent to secure that process and the blockchain is delicately balanced as a result. Bitcoins are a fundamental value unit that was made for its network and only for that network in my opinion and now we want to let them move off that network potentially never to return. Satoshi never provisioned for this. That doesn't feel right to me.
4. What knock on effects would occur to the Bitcoin network if 20-30% of these tokens get lost from a sidechain failure thus wiping out all the associated bitcoins as a result? The answer could be way more complex than just "oh, my bitcoins will be worth more".
5. With merged mining it would be easier to attack and steal the tokens and thus bitcoins associated with them. What can be done to prevent this?
6. What if there was an economic way to solve the problem of scamcoins without touching the protocol? I reference Peter R's proposal of Spin Offs.
7. Is there really a "problem"with Bitcoin that we need to risk the entire system like this? Why can't Bitcoin act like a reserve currency around which altcoins can orbit without touching/risking the protocol? I reference the fork we got from a simple non protocol change last year from just 0.7-0.8. The devs including gmax failed to anticipate this despite the best of intentions.
8. It's important to realize that we have intentionally lived with bugs in the system all these years because we're dealing with a form of money that you can't make mistakes with. Billions are at risk and damned straight I'm protective of this. Bitcoin has worked well so far imo. It seems we always get these proposals at the bottom of a price lull so be wary of people proposing changes who have no stake in the system.
I'm willing to wait until the whitepaper comes out for final judgment as maybe I'm getting too conservative in my old age but those are my concerns.

Why would it be surprising? 
The Fed hid so much from the American people during the crisis and after. Much of the TARP went to bail out foreign banks. All sorts of swap lines were extended while Americans lost their homes. And they did it again in 2011 during the European bond crisis. 
Much of the QE since has been spent with the stated goal by Bernanke of propping up the stock market for confidence reasons. 
It's estimated the Fed buys 70%of the treasury auction since China dropped out of the market. I'm not surprised at all they would try these shenanigans.

@_date: 2014-11-22 01:33:03
here's the extremely cynical part of me.
we know for a fact that several high profile CEO's have been quite vocal about their nervousness to invest in BTC itself for political or regulatory concerns. all those All Star investors pouring money into Blockstream may see a way to subvert Bitcoin by encouraging a bunch of insider core devs to insert a piece of code, the spvp, into source that will forever change the sound money function of Bitcoin by breaking the link btwn the currency unit and its BC.  we know that the units are not the same when they leave the BC.  Blockstream has said those units become unshackled from the restrictions of the 10 min confirmation times, the publicity of addresses, script limitations, etc.  They "say" they only want to research improvements to Bitcoin itself.  when in fact, they might just want to be paid alot of USD's for constructing SC's.
"they", meaning the investors and Blockstream devs, may be doing it knowingly or unknowingly.  we'll never know.

As Big Money said, the proper way to do this is to generate new addresses on the online wallet. You never have to do so on the offline wallet. Theoretically the offline wallet should auto generate addresses as the online wallet does so. However the default setting is for the offline wallet to pre-compute 1000 addresses but you won't see them listed there.

When you get paid for a service you bank the money and forget about it. Guaranteed increase in your net worth typically. Thus taxation as ordinary income.
Bitcoin mining is nothing like that.  You take inordinate risk just trying to get a hold of the equipment. I should know, having made a bad endorsement of an incompetent hardware maker. All those people who lost money in that process should fully deduct those losses on their tax forms if that's the way the IRS wants to play.
Even once gotten there is no guarantee Bitcoin even survives and doesn't go to zero.
It's still very hard to convert Bitcoin to fiat also. Thus ruling is forcing people to sell just to raise fiat to pay these taxes.
@_date: 2014-05-29 10:21:55
That's not true. 
If people believe as I do that Bitcoins price will still move up, it pays to store your money in Bitcoin until you need to buy.

Actually, I've always thought that brick and mortar stores are the perfect venues for Bitcoin transactions. 
Sellers can look their customers in the eye and wait for one or two confirmations and they're good. No possibility they'd be sending the goods to the wrong person. 
Buyers can look their merchants in the eye and be sure their goods will be handed to them from behind the counter once one or two confirmations go through. 
Once goods get handed over what's done is done.

i suppose if they don't get enough demand to fill the dollar value of BTC sold to the Trust, they'd have to sell some.  but i seriously doubt that is going to happen.  there are plenty of ppl wanting to buy a vehicle that doesn't force them to hold BTC outright.  plus, have it essentially insured and regulated by Wall St and SEC.  retirement plans and pensions also come to mind.

what i'm trying to tell you is that you are totally neglecting the speculative mind of markets.  most of today's trading is speculative b/c of all the CB printing.  they consist of floor traders, hedge funds, and day traders at home clicking away at their computers.  none of these guys are doing work; they're speculating on what will go UP.  and they have, and will likely to continue, betting on limited supply resources like the Bitcoin unit. they control huge amt of speculative capital.  they don't want to pour thru prospectuses, do due diligence, interview founders or boards; they just want to move money seamlessly and easily.  the fixed M of Bitcoin has huge possibilities and potential which everyone is beginning to understand.

@_date: 2014-01-11 11:11:26
No, the premise of what the OP is suggesting is correct. 
Right now what overstock is doing is having to use Coinbase  to clear their coins. Coinbase  then has to sell them on an exchange to hedge their risk. It would be much better for overstock to offload those coins onto another supplier to promote velocity within the economy itself. The supplier also may actually be in a position to hold onto some coins as a speculative play which would be better than just having them dumped onto an exchange. Or they could further pass them on to one if their suppliers. 
More people and actual businesses involved the better.

@_date: 2014-04-13 17:45:37
i disagree.
its helpful to picture both Sidechains and Spin offs (altclones) as a series of parallel chains running vertically (or horizontally if you prefer) centered on the Bitcoin blockchain.  instead of the on/off ramps connecting the chains being technically based, as you are proposing, the on/off ramps are economic in altclones.  this lets the free market link the chains seamlessly thru exchanges presumably.  note that these exchanges don't have to deal with fiat or the regulations that go with that. the important thing is that these altclones are not connected technically to the Bitcoin protocol with all the risks that go along with that.  look what havoc a minor change like the 0.7 to 0.8 caused via the block fork last year.  you seem to trivialize the description of sidechains down to just a couple minor code changes in scrypt but fail to account for the numerous economic chain reactions that result from that.  i'm not a coder, nor an expert in cryptography, but from what i've read so far from you, your proposal seems much more technically complex than i think you're letting on.  i see that as a major risk for Bitcoin.  at least with altclones, the protocol is totally walled off and has no risk.  BTC stay in the Bitcoin network where they belong.  an altclone reduces the altcoin down to a simple evaluation of it's merits as an innovation and will make that judgment from an economic standpoint, not risking a technical failure of the whole system that could occur from your proposal.  
i also see no economic motivation for a dev to create a sidechain, unlike with an altclone.
the important thing to remember about altclones is that their birth will distribute the altcoins amongst existing Bitcoin holders which gives the altclone an immediate user network effect and allow Bitcoiners to welcome and assess the altclone on its merits as opposed to a threat.  b/c of all the scamcoins that have arisen, we have entered a zero sum game situation where the scamcoins have been siphoning off much needed capital from Bitcoin.  both proposals will eliminate that i think we agree.
altclones are not a guaranteed get rich scheme as you are describing b/c the dev has much more to consider now and will be forced to introduce an altcoin based on merits only since he cannot immediately profit from an individual premine or IPO only then to dump.  b/c he has the most "insider knowledge" of his altcoin's merit, he can be rewarded by scooping up any coins dumped by naysayers from the skeptical Bitcoiners who dump their free coins once the free market for trading opens.  even then he can't dump b/c the opening prices for these coins will probably be in the pennies.  he'll have to keep working at the code and improvements to make his fortune grow.  this is a reasonable economic risk that a dev should have to make.

No one is against innovation. Just do it on main chain. Perhaps none of the here to for suggested changes to bitcoin have been compelling enough to actually take the time to gain consensus? 
And you're exactly right. Those who seek to change the source code now will disadvantage all those who came before them. Specifically those who have helped make bitcoin what it is. And Blockstream even has the gall to form a for profit company to take advantage of that. Little do they know that that kind of hypocrisy will destroy everything for everybody.

I have through my subscription service for 2 years . I've held every bitcoin speculating it would go up. It's been a fantastic decision. There was also that restaurant couple who retired from their restaurant business from their appreciating bitcoin a few months back. 
Euro Pacific is in a perfect position to do this as I assume they're in excellent financial condition and can afford to hold given the low overhead type of business they're in. It's the lowest risk way to quickly get bitcoin; sell a product or a service. and because they're in the hard money business they should understand how important Bitcoin is and how it will fit into our new digital economy. I bet they're diversifying. 
You forget Euro Pacific is a new addition to the bitcoin economy and is increasing velocity. This is not related to simply increased selling of bitcoin for gold which by itself would cause downward pressure.

the only thing i have against Blockstream is that it's a for-profit.  this creates an economic incentive to create speculative SC's that won't be merge mined and will be insecure.  they get paid for each SC they create.  these SC's won't survive unless they can siphon BTC to themselves for liquidity and for the value that the BTC bring.  Bitcoin itself will be damaged as those tx fees that would have been paid to Bitcoin miners will now end up with the SC.  plus BTC's are *transformed* to whatever speculative asset is offered on the SC.  they won't have the same value.
simply inserting an offramp into the source code "systematizes" the destruction of Sound Money, imo.  Blockstreams conflict of interest will enhance that breakage.

Silbert has it right : Bitcoin the currency cannot be separated out from the protocol/platform/payment system. They are both fundamental to its functioning as the currency units provide the economic incentive which drives the POW of mining and thus security. 
This is in direct contrast to what Andreas is saying; that the currency is just the "first app" layered on top of the platform. He keeps saying that the currency could go to zero and the platform will be OK.  
No, they are inextricably entwined. Everything else from here on in will be layered on top.

@_date: 2014-04-14 18:19:04
does this seem simple to you?  go all the way down for Adam to me:
*A good chunk of it is up to the sidechain, so I don't think there is a single crisp answer.
I'm going to be terribly unfair here: I say unfair because it may look like I'm giving you a wall of complex, ill defined arguments, and suggesting you need to defeat each one. The fact of the matter is that there cannot be a single security story for all sidechains and thinking in this space is still developing. So I'm going to summarize the tools I've been thinking about to boost sidechain security beyond SPV levels. Some of them may be bad, and I'm not suggesting you should need to defeat all of them— I'm basically listing them to convince you that there is a lot of space here to build security better than "not being dicks", though perhaps not ideal for all applications.
But before I do, I want to suggest two thoughts:
The first— How sure are we that in the long run Bitcoin security is any better? We know that today vast majority of miners (people with hashing hardware) do not validate anything, we know that the vast majority of merchants do not validate anything, we know that the majority of end users do not validate anything. Yet validation is stupidly cheap today, and so what happens if its necessary to uncap the blocksizes and validation becomes expensive? Validation has basically perfect centralization gains (validate once instead of N times). What happens as the subsidy fades to nothing?
The second thought— What security is actually required? There are many applications for Bitcoin, they don't all have the same security requirements. There are people doing low value unconfirmed transactions today. They already can be pretty easily ripped off with the help of miners— can't some of these transactions move to a solution with reduced security even if no methods are deployed to increase security?
One of my goals for sidechains is that they may act as a pressure relief value so that floods of very low value (and low security requirement) transactions do not necessarily force all of Bitcoin security to the low level justified by these transactions.
Now on to increasing sidechain security beyond the SPV-ish level that you get from the basic sidechain idea, for each one I'll list the tool and what I consider to be it's main weakness:
(0) If a sidechain is universally used, then miners could enforce its correctness as a soft-forking change to Bitcoin (e.g. reject blocks that contain an invalid sidechain proof), and validators could adopt it too. At that point the security story is the same as Bitcoin's. This is weak in that it removes the loose coupling and freedom for full nodes to not validate a sidechain they don't care about. But it seems strictly better than just making the soft forking change in Bitcoin directly, since you're not forced to do so before anyone is even using it yet.
(1) My CoinWittness
 
post describes using ZK-SNARKS to construct compact proofs of correctness that could be used to convince people a sidechain spend is valid. This is weak in that it really cutting edge cryptography and the prover part takes a lot of resources but the verifier is trivial and if its used its purely additive in security.
(1a) It's possible to efficient proofs of valid execution in an interactive challenger model without invoking any novel crypto at all
 
. Basically the sidechain proof generator encodes a transcript of his verification process and commits to it. Then if his verification was wrong, a challenger shows up with a different commitment, and there is a log() communications process to decide which of the competing claims are valid. Because this is interactive, however, this is weak because if &gt;50% of the Bitcoin hashpower blocks it they can hide the fraud proofs. It's also weak in that while the fraud proofs are log2() they can get somewhat large and the sidechain must implement its validation in a transcript producing model.
(2) The definition of the sidechain can specify a federation of parties that must threshold sign blocks (including, perhaps, updates to the federation list). This is weak because it creates a (distributed) point of centralization around the federation.
(2a) The definition of the sidechain can require that the spends are signed by systems running the verification code on remote-attest hardware (like arm trustzone). Then anyone can spin up a verifier and the security is tractable to the integrity of the remote attest and intel/amd/etc keys. This is weak in that no one has great confidence in the strength of remote attest Smiley. Though if it can be combined with (2) for purely additive security.
(3) Proof of Stake-ish federation: Have utxo in the sidechain provide public keys which are used to build threshold signatures that must sign the proofs. This is nice in that in the few-users case it degrades to perfect security, but at large sizes it may be hard to make both efficient and reliable.
(4) Econonmic incentives for honest mining can be created by techniques like bonding the creation or having some fee deferral tokens. Adam has thought more about ideas in this space than me. I generally think the economic incentive approaches are tricky to reason about.
I don't think this list is exhaustive, but it's some things I've been thinking about in terms of trying to making the design on the bitcoin side generic enough that sidechains are free to innovate in their security story too. Sidechains could implement zero or more of these approaches and potentially even change them through there life— e.g. boostraping in a federated-signing model but with a pre-programmed transition to more decenteralized security if/once that sidechain has grown enough.*
**Adam to me:**
*No the security firewall is quite categoric (modulo a bug in the critical code change to bitcoin main). It was a reference to previously less clear thinking on the topic of how to secure them - I was saying, I was happy that [-3] had come up with a very simple and robust argument for why it is safe for bitcoin-main.
**The only people with coins at risk to bugs in a given side-chain are those with coins in that side-chain.** Main bitcoins are immune from bugs in a side-chain. And one side-chain is immune from bugs in other side-chains.*

of course then you'd have to say that Blockstream and its investors have made a $21M bet that Sidechains will be a winner while requiring a source code change to make that happen ;)
don't forget that simplicity in money is a feature, not a bug.  the Bitcoin protocol, as it stands, provides that.

@_date: 2014-12-17 00:43:15


what?  you asked me to give you an example of where SC's can't compete with altcoins and i gave you the perfect, very common example of Doge.  there are lots of similar alts; point being the SC folks love to say they will eliminate altcoins.  it's a false promise.


i believe i am evaluating them objectively.  i think the entire concept is flawed.  SC folks complain about the Bitcoin blockchain and protocol "restricting" their development and innovation.  well, i happen to like those restrictions and believe those are what brought us to where we are; those of a sound money.  those same restrictions prevent monkeying around with the rules by a for profit company goes against everything i thought we were doing here.  
altering the protocol by creating an spvp offramp for BTC units changes the economic assumptions drastically, imo.  it's the stated objective of BS to dev all sorts of SC's for stocks, bonds, insurance, etc.  those would be distracting and dilutive.  instead of new investors having to buy into BTC to help move up the price, they instead would be faced with a menu of options from which to choose.  miners on MC "need" that higher price to be profitable and to maintain securirty on MC.  
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:10:19

@_date: 2014-11-14 16:30:35


first off, Satoshi doesn't control anywhere near that amount.  and from all appearances, i don't think he has any intention of cashing out any amts he does have, otherwise he would have done it when price was $1200.  but i know, that is just an assumption.  but still, even if he does cash out if and when the price goes much higher, so what?  he invented something big that has tremendous potential.  no one screamed when Steve Jobs took enormous profits on his Apple shares.
point being, many early adopters already *did* cash out at $1200.  BTC's have been distributed far and wide.  there will always be hodlers and yes, they have a chance to really make hay.  but that is just the way investment works if you've done it long enough.  early adopters stand to make alot.  don't fight it.

you're missing the fact that every tx requires 2 parties.  if i sell my Bitcoin to Euro Cap for gold, then by definition Euro Cap wants my Bitcoin.  in fact, my bet is that they'll decide to keep it for the store of value purposes that Peter finally seems to understand.  this latter part is what is news; *Schiff now accepts Bitcoin.*
even if Euro Cap turns around and sells to Bitpay, Bitpay by definition then wants those Bitcoin.  they may decide to hold it.  if not, they then sell it to someone who does.  and on and on.  someone will hold it.  if anything, this is what we call monetary velocity, which is a good thing.

ppl keep making this argument.  no one is saying all the execs get into one room and decide to do this.  what is happening is that many of them are making the independent calculation that it is profitable to engage in this activity.  why not?  no one is held accountable by going to prison.  they just pay a small fine out of the corporate acct.  b/c the chances are small of being caught, they therefore conclude it's profitable to do it.  the CEO's claim they have no idea.  i doubt that altho it would be impossible to prove they do.  all they have to do is stare a mid level manager in the face and say make money, i don't care how you do it.  just don't involve me.

from this post, read forward for even more clarifying explanations the way i see it.

they want to tax it as a currency for services when mined but then as property when you spend or sell it.  when you're paid for services in fiat, do you have to pay long term capital gains on the USD when you spend it a year later?  no, you pay your ordinary income taxes once and that's it.

price matters alot.  if it was $0.01, market cap would be $130,000.  how many Teslas could get sold in that situation?  none.  as their payment processor tries to flip that amount of BTC into the exchanges, the price would tank wiping out the price even more.  would Dell, Expedia, or Overstock even consider transacting in BTC with a price that low?  hell no.  in order for any entity of serious size to transact in the Bitcoin system, we have to have an elevated price to provide liquidity in the market and prevent volatility.  
that's why their argument is misguided.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:21:04
SC's can't stop altcoins.  most altcoins are based on dubious monetary properties which devs and Bitcoiners won't participate in with or w/o a SC.
conflicts of interest, esp when it comes to control via core dev, in a monetary system that promises to be neutral for all won't work.

you're assuming of course that banks are playing by the time tested rules of 10:1 leverage.
nope, back in 2008 many banks were caught with 100:1 meaning only 1% equity.  when assets dropped &gt;1%, like their housing loan portfolios, they went bankrupt.  except for the fact that Uncle Ben and Hanky Panky forced the US taxpayer to pony up and buy those crap assets from them for full value cash.  
and the Keynesians have the audacity to claim nothing is going on.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:17:46
you have to realize that central banks are composed of ppl who act in aggregate just like an individual.  they are subject to the same conflicting emotions that all of us get when thinking about Bitcoin.  thus, they will swing back and forth with warnings and guidance.  
the other thing is that there will never be a consensus to ban Bitcoin worldwide.  this conflict btwn Putin and the US right now is evidence to this.
the trick is to stay focused on the fundamentals of Bitcoin.  i'm sure they realize it can't be stopped.

but can you see that as a productive economy builds up around the use of Bitcoin, that the demand for usage of BTC will grow?  and that will drive the price up as it surely has demonstrated over the last 5 yrs.  
let's flip this around.  what makes the USD strong is the US economy that is built around it.  the businesses, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit that has lead America for the last 60 yrs.  Bretton Woods made the USD the reserve currency of the world b/c of what America had accomplished in WW2 in terms of industrial production.  we also came out of that war unscathed and with the most promise economically of any other country in the world.  the USD didn't exist in a vacuum with no means of valuing it.

She was clearly extremely intelligent and I remember I kept watching the tv show hoping to get a glimpse of what she looked like. Clearly, Tom loved her and I'm sure all the listeners did as well as she became one if the main tv anchors quickly.

Back in the days of bimetallism, I think the only reason silver wax used was because there wasn't enough gold around, it was hard to divide, it was heavy, and it was probably considered too expensive per unit. Plus geography guaranteed a non uniform distribution of both metals. 
Contrast that with bitcoin. Can be infinitely divisible, if necessary, transmitable world wide instantaneously, perfectly fixed supply, infinitely portable, rides on Internet commerce rails, international, no counter party storage necessary, and hides from banks and govts, if necessary. 
As far as alts go, the code can be updated for any serious needs or if attacked. I think we have all the features we need although it would have been nice to have more anonymity. But I think the pseudonymity will be enough. 
We only need one.

good luck to the US gov't enforcing that on foreign exchanges.  nonetheless, i'm sure they got their hands on the mtgox db but that should be a one off.
banks have no knowledge about bitcoin tx's.  it's a p2p network and most tx's occur locally.  they'll only know about those tx's that serve as on and off ramps for  larger scale conversions requiring banks.

the great thing about this particular investment is that of all the wallets and exchanges out there, blockchain.info adheres most closely to the founding principles of Satoshi and Bitcoin.  headed by Roger Ver, you just know that blockchain.info will never do anything to compromise the original Bitcoin vision; that of privacy (tumbling), personal handling of keys, safety, and great development.  they even pay all their employees in Bitcoin negating the need for banks.
this development almost ensures Bitcoin's long term survival.

How is it coercive?
No one forces you to claim your altcoins in this scenario. They are freely given to you as a current Bitcoin holder. This immediately sets up a head to head competition between the original and its clone based on the merits of the tech alone.
Because the cryptocurrency universe has become a zero sum game fiasco, due to scamcoins, this method of distribution will force true innovative projects to emerge, or else be destroyed.
And it's simple, elegant, low risk economic solution to a complex problem. Sidechains run a severe risk of disrupting Bitcoin.

i totally agree with this.
Bitcoin no longer becomes a matter of a unique, fixed supply currency (Sound Money) that has the potential to compete on the worldwide stage of fiat currency Forex markets and with gold.
it merely becomes a WoW trading platform where new investors are just as likely to buy the stock, bond, insurance, smart contract SC than they are to buy into BTC, the currency unit.
if we only allow ourselves to continue to focus on what has brought Bitcoin to where it is today, ie a SOV new age money, the growth potential from tapping Forex (which is the largest market in the world) and gold will take us to the Moon.

most importantly, bugs do exist in Bitcoin that cause unknown dependencies within the code.  these aren't so great as to cause Bitcoin to make mistakes fortunately.

I agree that there has been many conflicting statements and that there will be more. I also agree that for customers the record keeping will be burdensome. Also, mining will be pushed out of the U.S.to a major degree except for those of us dedicated to the task.
However from an investor's standpoint, this will bring much needed clarity resulting in more money coming into the system. The IRS won't be reversing their decision anytime soon so my bet is we have at least a couple of years of predictable taxation to look forward to. That's big. Tax avoidance is one of the major fears all of us early adopters have had since day one.
I for one will be able to offset some of this forced income from mining and pay with long term capital losses that have been sitting on my books for a few years. This will be great because I won't have to sell the Bitcoin to do this. Once those coins are liberated from taxation, i will be able to do what I want with them.

It's interesting how those of us in Bitcoin see it differently but arrive at the same conclusion. 
Bitcoin is many things. From my perspective since day one, I've viewed Bitcoin primarily as a store of value. And that to me has worked out beautifully despite the volatility. You just have to understand it and use said volatility as an opportunity. But this is because I've come at it as a speculative investor. That's not to say I didn't recognize it as a payment network however. It just hasn't been my main emphasis. Hence, we get my main involvement in my gold threads over at Bitcointalk. 
Fred on the other hand, being in the payments business, sees Bitcoin primarily as a payment processing system. Perhaps because he makes transaction fees from it?  No problem there as far as I'm concerned. The important thing is we both arrived at the same conclusion. 
Bitcoin is good.

he tenets that Satoshi did get right were the economic ones, mainly that of a fixed supply with a fair distribution.

I worry that the way Second Market is developing their "hub and spoke" exchange model with the banks being the inner spokes is at risk of this.

when using Mycelium, the best way is to use the BIP38 cold storage method where you use Bitaddress.org to generate an offline paper keypair.  scan the public QR code into Mycelium to keep track of the balance.  throw the original paper wallet into your safe but before doing so, make a paper copy of the private key, cut it into a small square, then laminate it and stick that in your physical wallet.  whenver you need to make a payment, use the cold storage function to scan the private key into flash memory to sign the tx.  when done, close out Mycelium to wipe the private key from the phone.  voila!  instant cold storage payments!

they couldn't be more wrong.  what's important is the increased velocity for bitcoin this allows and the increased distribution thru the population.  this allows hoarders to disgorge their coins thru practical usage rather than forced selling.  those who continue to hoard will be rewarded as the price will have to eventually rise thru increased adoption.

actually, the whole point of Bitpay is to simplify accepting Bitcoin as payment.  most merchants don't want the hassle of setting up an accounting system that is also secure.  hence they use Bitpay.
now it turns out, most merchants are seemingly mostly converting to USD b/c of the present day volatility.  but that volatility is decreasing with time so ideally they can afford to hold more BTC if they want to engage in a little speculation as well as make sales.  
in this case with Schiff, b/c he was so anti-Bitcoin in all ways, what seems more likely is that he's had an epiphany and wants to obtain some for speculation.  we'll see.
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:51:25

how do we know this?  markets behave in funny &amp; unexpected ways.  i was talking to a University economist at the Hasher's United conference and he had felt Bitcoins "fixed supply" was a huge problem for ultimate success b/c it couldn't be increased in times of stress.  now you're going to tell him Bitcoin is even better or will be priced even higher as a result of decreasing the supply by 20-30% in a SC failure?  i'd be he'd say that was a disaster in the making.  personally, i'm humble enough to say "i don't know" what would happen but i sure can see that it would be possible for the public to actually "lose" confidence in such a scenario.  but yet you seem to be so "certain".

i worry that somehow they, Blockstream, is able to get the spvp into the source code b/c everybody just says "don't worry about it".  why would that be a concern?  b/c it would show the market that a group of insiders could abuse their position (40% of core devs + 3 top committers) to insert what is in essence a political (includes financial motives) slice of code that is specifically designed to facilitate its business model at the expense of competitors (like Bitshares, CP, Ethereum, all altcoins).  that would be a bad message to send and, imo, decrease confidence in Bitcoin itself as a an impartial, apolitical new age form of sound money.  
note there are 2 parts there:  the financial conflict of interest of the spvp and what i consider the breakage of the sound money function of Bitcoin (breakage of the link btwn currency unit and its BC).

the basis of my argument is that the BTC unit cannot be separated from its blockchain (mainchain) w/o breaking Bitcoin as Money.  imo, sidechains allow this and if you read their whitepaper, their core assumption is that they they can be separated.
Blockstream registered as a for-profit entity earlier this year and they have $15M investment.  their biz model is constructing SC's for other entities, namely corporations, banks, gvts, anyone willing to pay for the tech.  in essence, they are now in the exact same position as Mastercoin, Bitshares, CP in terms of competing to mold Bitcoin into profitability for themselves.
their business model is dependent on inserting a change into the source code called a SPV proof.  this would allow BTC to flow off the highly secure Bitcoin blockchain ledger into these SC businesses where sidechain ledgers rules will be determined however the business wants and will be inherently less secure as they will not be merge mined or even directly mined.  they will require trust and will ensure security most likely by signing off on blocks as they are constructed with their own signing keys.  
there will be thousand of entities who will bolt themselves onto Bitcoin via these SPV proofs. this will in effect allow a siphoning of value, BTC units, out of Bitcoin itself.  how will Bitcoin miners make their required income from tx fees if all these BTC have moved offchain to sidechains?  how will Bitcoin maintain its monetary function if all these BTC have moved to sidechains and have been converted to all manner of speculative assets?
Blockstream has every incentive to encourage this siphoning process.  as a for profit beholden to investors, not only do they have an incentive, they have an obligation.

i actually think he is doing the right thing for himself by getting out in the public.  he is explaining his side of the story, in detail, and it is a compelling one.  just look what it is spawning; moves like this FOIA request by supporters.  many in the Bitcoin community see it Charlie's way now that he has explained precisely what has happened.  they will go out of there way to put pressure on regulators and make them aware of public scrutiny.
and i never get why ppl like you automatically conclude that Charlie will incriminate himself and say things that will *absolutely* be used against him in the court of law. alot of ignorant ppl assume he is guilty when they see a picture of him.  but once they listen to him in interviews, it becomes clear he's just a young guy with alot of good intentions.  he is educating the public and public perception will go a long way in deciding where this case goes imho.

Most importantly, Summers understands gold.  He made a major contribution to Gibson's Paradox as it applies to free markets:  "Gold prices *should* move inversely to real interest rates."  
He has been accused by gold bugs of undermining the paradox by engineering gov't interference in the gold markets and pushing the price down despite the ongoing drop in interest rates also engineered by gov't so as not to alarm the population.  they have been marginally successful in doing so over the past few decades.
along comes Bitcoin.  a new problem that they potentially can't control.  **Summers sees it.**

there is also a technical problem.
unless a Sidescam can get ALL the pools to merge mine it out of the box, centralization is assured thus exposing the Sidescam to an attack.  for ex: if only Discus Fish and Ghash decide to merge mine then immediately one or the other will have &gt;51%.  it will cost them nothing to initiate the attack as no POW has been expended on the Sidescam.

@_date: 2014-04-19 21:29:14
I'll take the cautious side here being a stake holder in Bitcoin. Not being a dev my concerns are purely theoretical and mostly economic.
1. In general, a for profit company with a low to no stake in Bitcoin should not be trusted to make changes to the protocol that facilitate its profit making. Especially if it's gone out and hired core devs and comes at the expense of the competition.
2. I would like to know who these core devs are supposedly supporting the whole concept besides gmax who has gone on record saying Bitcoin needs to be "fixed". I don't understand the secrecy as I've asked for those names several times. I for one don't think Bitcoin needs fixing.
3. I've always conceptualized Bitcoin as being a self contained financial system so I am concerned that it's fundamental value units will be allowed to leave its system destined for what will inevitably be a weaker sidechain from a security standpoint. In that sense I don't see them as "the first app" overlaying the protocol like Andreas likes to say. I see them as fundamentally integrated into the network. Invariably, whatever token your bitcoin is transformed into will be worth less as a result.  We've spent 5 long years distributing those bitcoins throughout the blockchain in a fair and truthful manner based on free market trading. $600 million has been irreversibly spent to secure that process and the blockchain is delicately balanced as a result. Bitcoins are a fundamental value unit that was made for its network and only for that network in my opinion and now we want to let them move off that network potentially never to return. Satoshi never provisioned for this. That doesn't feel right to me.
4. What knock on effects would occur to the Bitcoin network if 20-30% of these tokens get lost from a sidechain failure thus wiping out all the associated bitcoins as a result? The answer could be way more complex than just "oh, my bitcoins will be worth more".
5. With merged mining it would be easier to attack and steal the tokens and thus bitcoins associated with them. What can be done to prevent this?
6. What if there was an economic way to solve the problem of scamcoins without touching the protocol? I reference Peter R's proposal of Spin Offs.
7. Is there really a "problem"with Bitcoin that we need to risk the entire system like this? Why can't Bitcoin act like a reserve currency around which altcoins can orbit without touching/risking the protocol? I reference the fork we got from a simple non protocol change last year from just 0.7-0.8. The devs including gmax failed to anticipate this despite the best of intentions.
8. It's important to realize that we have intentionally lived with bugs in the system all these years because we're dealing with a form of money that you can't make mistakes with. Billions are at risk and damned straight I'm protective of this. Bitcoin has worked well so far imo. It seems we always get these proposals at the bottom of a price lull so be wary of people proposing changes who have no stake in the system.
I'm willing to wait until the whitepaper comes out for final judgment as maybe I'm getting too conservative in my old age but those are my concerns.
@_date: 2014-04-12 03:00:07
looks legit.
@_date: 2014-11-19 15:08:46
yes.  it's works on the same principle as SPV clients do today.  sure, they are going to try and decrease the probability attack sphere by ramping the math difficulty but still it will never be as good as mining.

why would they waste resources on developing a blockchain when they already have Swift, ACH, wiring, etc?
blockchains are a decentralized concept that depend on POW to secure themselves.  w/o POW their blockchain would be exposed to attacks and there would be no centralized means to enforce the truth.

It's not fragmentary.
The altclones can be linked seamlessly and efficiently by economic means by simply trading Bitcoin for whatever currency or units the altclone has specified.

as a miner for over 3 yrs, i highly doubt this effect.  just 4-6 mo ago, i noticed that BTCGuild where i pool was in fact MM NMC for me.  they do it by default, i guess, and one day i looked in my web wallet and there was some NMC!  whoop deedoo!  they are hardly worth anything and i certainly didn't bother selling them for the pittance they would get me.  they're mostly a novelty for me and certainly didn't affect my decision making to mine or not in the whole scheme of things.  and if i had been given a choice to do so or not, i would've chosen NOT to MM NMC.
also, MrMadden gave you several clear reasons why MM comes at a signif cost to miners in terms of data reqs and labor.  i agree with him.  it's a pain enough to maintain just BTC mining let alone MM.  also, i highly doubt miners could MM more than a couple SC's at a time given the complexity.

no one knows if those coins are irretrievably lost.  could be in the hands of hacker or mark himself.  that "loss" was not related to a protocol failure either as could happen if you make a mistake coding up a sidechain.


but with sidechains, you're doing things differently than p2sh.  Adam comes to the community with a for profit company that pays core devs to help facilitate a protocol change.  that's at the least unfair advantage in my book.  everything  i've heard you talk about from a technical standpoint is about how to facilitate or secure sidechains.  you're going to change some op codes, probably expand script.  how is that not helping one company while ignoring the others like mastercoin, ethereum, protoshares, or other altcoins? 
as well, i presume you were a guest at the house they rented in California for selected core devs.  why are the names of the others being kept quiet?  you say you're not getting paid.  i accept that.  but surely that isn't a commitment on your part to NEVER get paid in the form of salary or consultant fees from Adam's company.  is it?




tell me, what is a soft fork?  sounds like a result of a core protocol change.
i've already said i have a vested interest in Bitcoin's success. and i'm trying to protect mine and every other Bitcoiner's interest.  no surprise there.  
it's funny you imply manipulation.  remember, i'm the guy who is happy with the status quo.  i wouldn't change a thing b/c i find Bitcoin to working just fine, thank you.  anyone who wants to change the protocol to favor their for-profit company, which is essentially rewriting the rules in the middle of the game for all other players, is the one who's doing the manipulation.

huge difference.
Gavin and Wlad have been extensively involved in Bitcoin since the beginning and have proven their trustworthiness, dedication, and commitment to Bitcoin.  they've built up their trust models and i trust them.  i don't know if Wlad works for a for-profit or not but i know Gavin works with Coinbase.  based on their credibility i just mentioned i have no problem with that.  they even have BTC positions from i can tell which gives them a stake in Bitcoin's success and encourages them to not be imprudent with code changes.  i commend them for that.
Adam's company is way different.  here we have a situation where we have a low to no stake holder in Bitcoin coming in and proposing a series of unknown hard coded changes to the protocol which they will profit from.  that, in and of itself, is unacceptable.  the bias or tendency is to dovetail those changes to benefit the for-profit model their company will introduce.  that is crazy and to think anyone around here would allow that is incredible.  this is why i often say "the geeks fail to understand that which they hath created".  why?  b/c they are so fucking naive and have fallen for scheme after scheme.  they have trouble keeping their eye on the ball.  i don't even have to know any other details of his proposal to conclude that.  from what i've read form nullc, these changes won't be trivial and could put the Bitcoin protocol at risk.
i know that Adam is the creator of the POW concept and for that i give him credit. he also seems like a good guy.  otoh, he misunderstood the Bitcoin opportunity and has essentially no stake in Bitcoin currently gleaned from his podcasts.  but i also give kudos to all the other creators of the multiple concepts that only Satoshi brought together, namely the Austrian school of economics, game theory, cryptography, and computer science.  are we to kowtow to them as well if they propose code changes?
this kinda shit happens at the bottom of every pullback.  we get a bunch of opportunists (i'm not saying that about Adam necessarily) coming in here and saying we need to "fix Bitcoin".  usually they are newcomers with no stake and nothing to lose.  i happen to think Bitcoin is functioning perfectly well, thank you.  the risk these changes bring to my mind are unacceptable.
Adam said that sidechains should be a no brainer and unite all current Bitcoiners b/c it will eliminate altcoins.  being a significant stake holder in Bitcoin, my mere objection is testament that his economic assumption is wrong.  i see problems with other parts of their economic assumptions as well regarding merged mining and development. these areas are where i can shed light.

some of us might ague that it was exactly that heavy regulation that resulted in gox's failure.  sure, they've done alot of wrong things like poor customer service but there's also a case to be made that seizing $5M for an application error 2 yrs before MSB clarification tipped the whole thing over causing a delay in USD withdrawals starting last summer.

@_date: 2014-09-04 20:07:48
sounds like we're essentially saying the same thing.  if you care to, you should read my posts from my gold thread.
as i said before, speculators know that the Fed has a policy in place to interfere in the UST auctions to continue lowering interest rates (increase bond prices) to stimulate a stagnating economy.  they've been doing this for 34 years straight.  thus, they front run these auctions by buying bonds and flip them to the Fed for a risk free return.  they also know that in times of crisis, the Fed will print to prevent a bond implosion.  speculators know their profits are guaranteed and backed by the full faith of the US gvt who will tax the hell out of us to ensure payment of these bonds.  or, the Fed will print like hell to prevent the bond prices from falling.  this creates a huge sucking sound as all wealth and capital is sucked into the gvt bond markets thus exacerbating the death spiral by increasing big gvt with all its inefficiencies, cronyism, and corruption. we're seeing evidence of expanding gvt everywhere.
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:18:52
And I think this is good:
1. Less chance of bot malware attack. 
2. highly efficient for hashing specific to Bitcoin. 
3. more expensive and difficult for gvt attack. 
4. and yes, apolitical. 
5. uptake only by dedicated Bitcoiners

most of the ppl i know intuitively get that it is a threat to the USD even though they might not understand how money works.  some even have said that Bitcoin goes too far.  i think that comes from the anonymity part and it's fixed supply.  basically, it comes down to fear.
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:12:34

Besides money laundering is a total straw man. There has been zero statistical evidence presented to back the sensationalism. I'd  bet there's close to zero money laundering going on. 
And if we still live in a democracy of innocent until proven guilty, it's up to you to prove otherwise. 
Don't forget most of Bitcoin companies have to start on a small budget. They need safe harbor protections at the beginning, not stifling regulations meant to stomp out competition.

What we do know :
1. We have a for profit company trying to change the protocol to facilitate a business model that will allow them to profit. This goes against the very ethos of Bitcoin. 
2. We were told that several core devs supported sidechains by Adam. It turns out only one is, gmax. 
3. Merge mining is inherently less secure than direct mining as it is reasonable to assume only a fraction of the bitcoin network will be willing to help. As a miner myself, I won't be helping. 
4. The whole idea of a 2 way peg is laughable given what we've already been told. People are being misled into thinking they will be able to zoom back and forth between chains effortlessly and without risk. No way. We've already been told there will be a delay as in days in confirming the transition as the bitcoins move back and forth. That introduces risk. When the bitcoins emerge onto the sidechain they are likely to be worth less than before. Depending on how much the bitcoins decrease in value in this scenario, you are going to have to pony up more cash or bitcoin to move back to main chain. If the chain fails you will lose everything. 
4. We can anticipate an attack being made, perhaps by a non economically motivated attacker. They'd wait until perhaps 20-30% of the bitcoins move to an apparently successful sidechain before launching the attack. By taking out that many bitcoin from the system I think the market would take that very negatively and it would destroy Bitcoin. We already have a perceptual problem with the public with our fixed supply. In this scenario, the intense deflation caused by a loss of this magnitude would be overwhelming. 
Let's flip this question around. How can you prove sidechains are beneficial to Bitcoin and can you guarantee us stake holders that you won't destroy the system? I think the burden of proof has to be born by those coming into the system demanding changing the rules in the middle of the game for their own benefit. 
Disclosure : I only own bitcoin, have no interest in any altcoins, nor any bitcoin or altcoin company.

there is a real practical drawback to Sidescams as well.
let's say one gets popular, say from faster tx times.  it becomes apparent that you should move to the SC.  now all the ppl who have cold wallets scattered round the globe have to go dig them out and make a special tx to transfer them to the SC.  this is not only a hassle but a potential anonymity risk.  after doing so, a non economic actor decides to take advantage of the fact that this merge mined chain is worth destroying.  they'll probably be successful especially if there's a transition in hashing protection going on simultaneously.

and it makes sense.  the definition of money is that it is widely used and accepted.
a money ceases to function as money if it requires tracking and sanctioning by the state.  by definition, it then won't be used by wide swaths of the global economy; namely the black markets and those interested in freedom.
the hypocrisy becomes even clearer when one understands that fiat (the USD) is the primary means of laundering money, selling drugs, buying child pornography, and financing terrorists worldwide.

@_date: 2014-03-21 18:13:21
damn, you do like to type.
problem is, changes like the internet upon which Bitcoin is based, takes time.  only a select few were able to envision what it could become back in the 1980's.  and even now, only slightly more are able to envision an internet of money.  the real acceleration has come in the last 10 yrs with the advent of broadband.  seamless communication with ordinary folk all over the world is allowing a spread of ideas that has never been seen before. 
i'm glad you brought up mining.  whereas you rightly pointed out a number of shyster companies, i would in counterpoint look at BitFury.  here's a poor guy who developed an asic chip in his garage and has turned that skill into a multi-million dollar company with chip variants being sold all over the world.  was Intel about to give him a shot at that inhouse?  no.  now that's a story and what you should be focusing on.  i too have extensive experience in that industry having given a mistaken endorsement to HashFast, a company who's customer service has turned out to be terribly disappointing.  i can tell you though that toxicity you speak of comes from the garage type founders of those companies that take pre-orders.  that is working itself out as we speak.  you're ignoring the millions of dollars of true mining demand however.  that's not scummy money, that's real money.  just look at the hashrate today; at another all time high.  i see nothing toxic from that standpoint.  that growth is ensuring the security of the Bitcoin network and means Bitcoin is not going anywhere in terms of south.
as an analyst myself, i too examine every facet of this industry.  that's my job.  what i see is that nothing has changed in terms of the fundamentals.  the last 5 yrs has seen tremendous growth that has surprised everyone, including yourself, i presume.  if you look at a logarithmic chart of Bitstamp we're seeing a series of bull ramps with bullish flag patterns.  
my bet is that gubmints worldwide are going to have conflicting views on Bitcoin, just like they do on everything else with the Russia thing currently being a great example.  Germany already has made Bitcoin perfectly legal as a private currency.  i'm awaiting the next country who will take it the next step further.  then you'll really see an explosion.  there's just too much money printing going on for this not to happen.  i'm fond of saying that the bull's have unlimited ammunition.  why, we have central banks worldwide feeding us unlimited fiat.  if you think we can continue to drive the stock market to the moon then Bitcoin can multiply that effect a thousand times.  Cuba is a poor example of US hegemony.  try China or Russia. 
the mere fact that our gubmint has been forced to convene Senate Banking and NYDFS hearings is a sign that they realize that they're dealing with something serious.  real serious.  Janet Yellen has gone on record stating that "I think it's not so easy to regulate Bitcoin because there's no central issuer or network operator to regulate."
so who am i to believe?  her or you?

@_date: 2014-12-17 05:44:43


but that is not how it is going to work.  we can expect separate markets with exchanges for each SC asset to pop up.  new investors investing into "Bitcoin" will now have a menu of assets to choose from to invest their fiat thus diluting any attraction the MC with BTC unit might have attracted. this would be expected to mute any price rises we might otherwise have attained by forcing outsiders to buy into the BTC currency on MC.  we, as a new currency system based on POW, need that price rise desperately to pay miners to continue to secure the network.  the SOV/investment of fiat has been what has driven Bitcoin to what it is today and i'd like to see us keep it that way until it matures and grows larger in size before diversifying into other assets.
by OS, i meant open source.   with Bitcoin, the open source dev seems to be more rigid than what you're describing for linux.  only code changes that have gained consensus and then tested gets adopted and put up on Bitcoin.org for download to users.  its worrisome that these 5 Blockstream devs might be able to get specific code into source that benefits themselves.

that is called merge mining.  there are only so many SC's a miner can merge mine with limited resources.  plus, they need to look at the longer term picture of whether they want to help support SC's at all since in the far future they will be stealing tx fees from the mainchain if they can't merge mine them.

the distinction is in fact muddied somewhat in my mind.  but i like to think of money as being a more universally accepted medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account that crosses borders while currency is a more localized form of money specific to a nation state.  that may not technically jive with the legal definition but works for me.
i am not an anarchist and paid my taxes a few weeks ago.  but there is no denying that the gov't has treated Bitcoin and some of it's earliest adopters and businesses in an inconsistent fashion especially in light of how they've treated banks the last many years.  perhaps that's a function of it's nascent state however imo it would be better to have hands off until Bitcoin's full nature is clarified by the free market much like the early days of the Internet.

Care to provide some evidence for anything you just said since you /they want to change the rules in the middle of the game? I'm all for innovation but not when the protocol needs to be changed to favor one for profit actor. I say sidechains put all of us at tremendous risk of bringing down the entire system just so a few low to no stake holders that missed out on the huge move up in bitcoin can profit. 
Altcoins/scamcoins haven't gone anywhere because heretofore they haven't brought any real innovation. So far they've only leeched value away from bitcoin. I'm not worried about Ethereum whatsoever. At least those guys, who I assume hold some bitcoin, know not to screw around with the bitcoin protocol so as not to kill the golden goose. Whether their concept of a premine works or not I'm skeptical. We'll deal with them with Spin Offs. 
This is why I'm so fond of saying "the Geeks fail to understand that which they hath created". I see a boundless inability to focus on the ball and concentrate on what's important and that is Bitcoin. 
So what if they want to form a for profit company by changing the rules and piggybacking off of our success? I say forget you. The only loyalty or alignment I see is the profit motive. They missed the boat. If they fuck the whole thing up for the rest of us they'll just throw up their hands and say sorry, I'm sure.

Is also unfair to expect new companies to conform and pay for existing fees created around the old legacy system. Most of those fees have been erected as barriers to entry.

nice argument.  throw a mountain of meaningless BS at me.
fact is, the IRS did not even consult anyone of substance in making their rush decision 3 wks before 4/15 in a blatant attempt to scoop up revenue while not understanding the complexities of what they were dealing with.  i don't know about you but in my industry, if i don't understand something and make a rush wide sweeping poor decision like that, i'd lose my job instantly.
Bitcoin is many things and doesn't fit nicely into the box of the IRS code.  eventually they will need to rewrite it to take this into account.

let me settle this once and for all since you haven't gleaned my motivation. i simply think they're based on a flawed assumption that you can separate the BTC unit from its BC.  no, i don't think SC's represent an extension of the MC.  SC's represent completely different ledgers and will carry risky assets which i think are antithetical to what Bitcoin represents which as you are tired of hearing me say is Sound Money.  SC devs will want their SC's to "win" over Bitcoin if they can do it.  Vitalik gave you an example earlier today of a known data point, Truthcoin.  that dev clearly wants to make a killing and will do what he can to attract BTC to his SC even if it hurts the MC.  they will compete.
also, you haven't addressed my question as to why we should let a for profit company like BS come in and change source code for their own profit model?  that is unfair to CP, MC, &amp; BS as many pointed out today after what Luke did. this sends the wrong message to the market and should be avoided.
OS doesn't mean anyone can just throw in whatever they want to the source code and we'll just sort it out by making a choice.  it's up to the community, esp one like Bitcoin, to try and determine ahead of time and thru consensus what would and would not be ideal to add to the code.  if we can figure out reasons why SC's would not be good for Bitcoin proper then we should do it and avoid any complications that could arise from faulty assumptions.

but i'll play along; let's say they do ban it here in the US.  they'd better be prepared to shut down the Internet.  we know that won't happen b/c too many of the TBTF banks depend on it.  it'll just go underground.  plus, the internet will route around the damaged US and Bitcoin will thrive elsewhere and the US risks losing out on future innovation and a robust economy.  they're caught btwn a rock and a hardplate.

RDP’s main weakness has always been Man-in-the-middle attacks. While alternate configurations (any VPN, SSL/SSH)  require  authentication of endpoints, RDP does not, and is vulnerable to attacks that would reroute traffic through a malicious machine (a “sniffer”) to capture data. While all data is encrypted (at varying levels), there was never any way to ensure that someone was not capturing all session data (including encryption keys) and performing decryption to recover passwords and other sensitive data.

You're ignoring the fact that the distribution of altcoin according to this method is free. No coercion there.
One if the unsaid goals of this proposal is to force altcoin devs to think twice before introducing a new altcoin.

this part doesn't even make sense.  those in the altclone who choose to hang on to the new altcoin or who accumulate them from Bitcoiners who dump them are speculating just like the early adopters in Bitcoin.  you're saying that late adopters who want to buy in later are forced into *rent collection*?  that's stupid.  i call it the free market system at work, just like ppl wanting to buy into Bitcoin now at these higher prices.  is that rent collection in your book?
i fully understand sidechains encourage the movement of bitcoin outside the bitcoin blockchain.  imo, they should stay put.  b/c of increased risk of being on a sidechain from decreased security they will have a lower market price.  that could be problematic.  and who knows what the economic effect of losing a chunk of bitcoin to an attack would permanently do to the system in terms of the subsequent deflationary effect or loss of confidence.  we already have a problem in perception with being labelled a deflationary currency.  this just makes it worse.

Just because the man has $30m in the bank doesn't mean he wouldn't rather spend your bitcoin than his cash for his campaign. In fact I'm sure he'd prefer that. 
My point is that the community is way past the point of just donating to a wildcard who had never expressed interest in bitcoin other than to take free money. Why hasn't he come out before to support us? Why doesn't he come out with a plan of action to advance bitcoin in the state? The bad thing as a community is that we have no concrete means to get a result from our contributions. These solicitations should be more directed to bitcoin businesses who could hold him more accountable for actually doing something for bitcoin if he gets elected. I have the feeling these politicians hear how generous bitcoiners have been in the past so they want to take advantage of that while at the same time feeling like they can get away with no commitments longer term.

OK, had to go back and watch it again to refresh my memory. 
Once everything is installed and set up on the 2 USB sticks, you boot into tails offline from first stick and reinstall the offline bundle and encrypted wallet from second stick solely to sign an online created transaction.

not being an attorney, it would seem to me that "services rendered" would imply some sort of contractual arrangement btwn 2 parties.  this certainly doesn't exist on the Bitcoin network as no one feels an obligation to pay me to put their tx's thru.
in fact, there are plenty of ppl who don't pay tx fees.  can i write off all those 0 fee tx's that i put thru on my taxes as losses?
put in that light, it becomes clear the true reason any of us mine is for the block reward.  which to me means we are more akin to gold miners speculating on hidden block rewards as opposed to seeking service fees which are only a small fraction of what's rewarded.

i have and it's a bitch.
however, i see your point about hashchains but the obvious question to me is how do you insure the bootstrap data is correct?  in other words, perhaps 50% of county clerks are aware of Bitcoin concepts.  tomorrow you tell the world that we are moving to a hashchain of county records so get your data prepared to form the first block.  several of these clerks decide they are going to alter records with properties in their name.  you still have the problem of bad input data.
Bitcoin's blockchain was the first mover and had the advantage of no one paying attention as it slowly bootstrapped itself to what it is.  this is why i always say that Bitcoin may only ever be applicable to Bitcoin as Money b/c no other blockchain seems to be able to replicate this bootstrapping effect w/o being compromised in some way.  why would a hashchain be any different?

I don't know if you can see it or not in your reader but two hours prior to your reply I did a strikethrough of what your pay might be stating that it was an unfair question.
Nonetheless, I've always thought your philosophical rants on topics like this have been strange if not outright unfair in the past.
Let's take this down to a technical and economic level so that we can evaluate the merits of these proposals more adequately. There's still much you haven't revealed about Sidechains but from what I'm hearing, I think Peter R's proposal is more elegant, simple, cheap, and no risk. No changes to the protocol are necessary unlike Sidechains. Why did we just get done reducing script size to 40 bytes from 80?
We need to pick this apart carefully.

furthermore, why is it that HFT firms co-locate their trading servers 50 ft away from the NYSE floor?  it's b/c they get that fraction of a second head start on everyone else.  these are indisputable facts but TPTB want us to swallow alternative explanations.

b/c M is fixed, there is a direct correlation to P.  while it's poss that P goes slightly down and Y goes way up, that is unlikely.  and here is where experience in trading markets helps and why the economy cannot be broken down into a simple formula as you are wont to suggest. P will correlate with Bitcoin price.
traders and speculators have spent the last decade bidding up relatively fixed supply markets of the commodity sector due to the vast amts of money printing, especially gold.  in your formula, the likelihood is that both P &amp; Y go up together since both are directly correlated to V since M is fixed.  that M is fixed is a huge emotional component to my argument with investors as they know that it cannot be manipulated in Bitcoin's case.  b/c of the huge amts of fiat floating around in the forex and gold mkts, the biggest mkts in the world btw, Bitcoin's price is likely to skyrocket.  here's the figures based on just a 5% move into Bitcoin:
1. 5% of monetary gold moving to bitcoin (by market-cap) would yield a bitcoin market-cap of ~$140B compared to today's ~$8.4B
2. $6T/d Forex x5%=$300B/$42M/d(BTCtxvol)=7143x$634=$4528662 per BTC

i think you need to rethink this.  how could Bitcoin core devs even begin to merge a NovauriCoin back into Bitcoin?  they're competing currencies after all with different properties.  so no, imo, NC is simple a competing currency that has been enabled by the SPVproof which has acted like an offramp to trade BTC for it.
my objections apply to a 1 way or 2 way peg.
my objection simply is that by inserting a SPVproof into the source code you allow BTC to leave its blockchain to less secure speculative SC's of all sorts.  i think that breaks the system of Sound Money.  the fact that Blockstream has a financial incentive to encourage the exit of BTC to the SC's it helps create is problematic for Bitcoin miners in the long run who can't make up for decreasing block rewards with mining tx fees.

yeah, i'm excited about the Go implementation.  shows promise.
otoh, i might argue that it's good that Gavin and the other devs aren't taking chances with too many modifications to the code.  never know when you'll make a mistake that costs everyone a few billion dollars of value.  supposedly though, i keep hearing they've re-written 70% of the code from the beginning.  that's pretty good and i'm sure alot of work.
altho i have to say i'd like not to see a situation like the tx malleability issue.  i actually don't fault Karpeles completely for that problem altho the majority of it was his fault since the info was out there.  it wouldn't have happened if the code had been patched prior to them getting hacked though so i can see the his argument too.  
i think the devs need to be more proactive about fixing the bugs they know about to prevent a similar situation.

Bitcoin is **here**. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:31:18
that's obviously a complicated question.
first off, i'm not aware of any other chain that has been MM'd other than NMC.  the fact it hasn't been hacked doesn't say anything really either since it is viewed as a public good, imo.  who doesn't want another ICANN alternative to DNS?  thus, all the MM concerns Todd has made come to bear such as centralization, increasing incentives to 51% at no cost, etc. 
second, on a philosophical level, i believe that Bitcoin was invented to be sound money, and money only.  by inserting an spvp offramp into source which allows the separation of the unit from its BC, you break the sound money aspect.  that part is controversial.  however, we do know that Blockstream plans on developing many speculative SC's that invest in stock, bonds, insurance, contracts, etc.  by allowing a transformation of highly liquid valuable BTC into all manner of speculative long term assets such as these that are not liquid, i believe, destroys Bitcoin as Money.  here's a post i put up on bitcointalk yesterday:
i'm glad everyone's been talking about Satoshi recently.  that stimulated me to go back thru his whitepaper to see if there were any references to any of the speculative SC's functions that are being proposed by the SC proponents in this thread and elsewhere.  those being listed below with the  mentioned.  they claim that SC's are a "natural and logical extension" to Bitcoin and that if Satoshi was able to be asked, he would love SC's.  well, i see no indication that this wild claim is valid.  see that none of these speculative assets were ever mentioned:
0 asset
0 stocks
0 bonds
0 insurance
0 smart
0 contracts
0 sidechain
0 offchain
0 separate
2 gold
**5 money**
it's clear to me that Satoshi intended for Bitcoin to be a new form of digital money, or currency if you will, that mimicked gold in all respects and improved upon it.  i'm only aware of one isolated forum post where he mentioned the addition of smart contracts, etc but that was in the context of adding them to the MC protocol.  never was there any mention of SC's nor the quack idea of separating the BTC units from the blockchain.  and understandably so.  by breaking the inextricable link btwn the two, you break security and therefore break Bitcoin as Money.  this is so obvious.  the last 200 pages have clearly demonstrated a myriad of ways things can go wrong with the SC proponents morphing their vision of how SC's will play out to satisfy any specific concern while promising us the moon.
Bitcoin should continue to focus on what got us to where we are:  the Money function.  that is where the problem lies today in the world of fiat and central banks.  this is what i saw back in January of 2011, Bitcoin as a poison dart aimed at the heart of central banks.  the problem is not stocks, bonds, insurance, contracts.  those all function reasonably well.  the problems we've had with them in the past, such as in 2001 and 2008, were fiat printing enabled and backed by central banks.  w/o the ability to print at will to bail out bad actors, Bitcoin as Money seeks to clamp down and eliminate this moral hazard.  and the network of money is ripe to be disrupted.  and rightfully so.  THAT is where the money is.  the Forex is the biggest in the world as i've shown.  the gold market is huge as well.  if Bitcoin can crack those markets we will go to the Moon.  Bitcoin should stay simple and non complex.  it has evolved to that of a public good.  no one should be allowed to corrupt its primary function of money.  let alone profit off it. 
**leave the source code alone**.

Blockstream wants to insert an spvp into the source code to facilitate their for profit SC production.  *that* is a conflict of interest as it will probably eliminate competitors like CP or Mastercoin or Bitshares.

Gavin, as much as I respect you and all you do and truly believe you are the right man for the job, when it comes to this, I think you are being overly charitable to your core dev colleagues who have now grouped together under Blockstream. 
Before Blockstream, all 5 of those guys were independent, unpaid core devs or committers to Bitcoin. Now they are all under one paid for - profit roof with $21M in investor money that needs to provide returns at least on an expected order of magnitude of 10x most likely. 
I'm sure you are looking at it from the standpoint that now we have more "decentralized paid" core development. I would argue we now have more "centralized self interested" core development.

if you'd listen to Richard Zabel and Cyrus Vance, you'd think Bitcoin has none of the problems some think it has:
1.  easy to move large amts of BTC with the click of a button.
2.  it is totally anonymous.
3.  ability to transact round the world with the click of a button.
4.  tx are irreversible which make it ideal as a value transfer mechanism.
5.  an ideal tax haven for those seeking to avoid taxes.
6.  Bitcoin HAS intrinsic value which makes it a store of value.
7.  an ip address does not equate to a person or individual.
one more thing Zabel says in the Q&amp;A:
Bitcoin is trying to function as cash.  And in many instances has many more capabilities than cash.

i see that it is potentially bad in general as well b/c of the hard coded changes.
having entered Bitcoin in very early 2011, even before Andreas and many other more public figures, one of the main contributions i feel i've made is contributing to help define what Bitcoin is, was, and will be, ie, Bitcoin Theory.  as the  poster on BitcoinTalk, i do have some credibility in this regard.
from the post below, i think it is dangerous to allow bitcoins, as units, to move out of the Bitcoin network.  as i've alluded to before and as Adam has confirmed, if a sidechain fails while your bitcoin are on it, you will lose them.  you might respond "that's ok, it just makes my bitcoin more valuable".  i don't think we know the answer to that as there could be all sorts of knock on effects from loss of confidence, feedback effects thru the code, excessive deflation from loss of the units.  
even if we go ahead and modify the code and sidechains don't take off, how can we be sure new exploits won't be introduced to Bitcoin itself?   or more importantly, strange and unpredictable economic effects?
i think Bitcoin should remain self contained.

**In full disclosure I’ve started buying it again after staying mostly on the sidelines for most of the past two years.**

i'm sure you see the folly of attempting to do this on a wide scale.  remember, i'm not advocating tax avoidance.  i'm just describing to you the futility of how they've decided to handle this.  i doubt they have the power to every year just walk into Coinbase and request all records.  that would be unprecedented and the political backlash would be astounding.  heads would roll from overreaching like that.  
everyone knows that audits are down b/c of lack of manpower and they're still reeling from the effects of the Occupy Wall St debacle.  you have to see that power is decentralizing and knowledge is spreading like wild fire.  even the postal service is talking about exchanging Bitcoin as they have been increasingly been made irrelevant given email, etc.  if the IRS wants to stay in the game with serious Bitcoin tax revenue, they are going to have to tailor their rules to accomodate the many facets that Bitcoin creates.  it's not a simple task.  
i still think a national sales tax enforced at the level of the merchant would have been the way to do it.

SC's can't ever be an independent testbed separate from Bitcoin itself.  they will be linked by the code, security, and economic assumptions of their relative values and any market evaluation will make an assessment of the entire ecosystem; Bitcoin+SC's in aggregate.
nothing will be learned from looking at a SC in isolation b/c of this economic linkage.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:10:45
this is my opinion based on economics.
i think Sidescams will be just as prevalent as Altscams.  if a Sidescam attracts say 20% or more BTC to it and then fails and vaporizes those BTC, it will not be good for Bitcoin.  the answer is more complicated than just "oh, it will make my BTC worth more".  
skeptics already believe the built-in deflationary aspects of Bitcoin go too far. in a failure, as above, i think the market may decide Bitcoin is just too deflationary to tolerate as an international currency.  i think it would be a disaster.

I've become even more fond of my favorite saying and that is **the Geeks fail to understand that which they hath created.**
IMO, Bitcoin is first and foremost a fixed supply form of money, not a blockchain to be used for smart contracts, colored coins, assurance contracts, etc. I would say that Satoshi developed blockchain technology to facilitate this one economic concept, not the other way around and that this one economic concept is what has lead to Bitcoins current success. The Geeks have been unable to focus on that ball to make it stronger. They've diluted their investments into all sorts of scamcoins and unrelated projects that have caused the outside world to look at the community, throw up their hands and say, as Daniel Krawicz has said, "what is all this shit? "
I keep hearing all these people complain they aren't going to buy bitcoin at these unfair prices therefore they are going to go start an Altcoin. This is precisely the problem. We haven't even successfully made Bitcoin an accepted form of money yet but we are trying to take over the world developing all this other stuff. There's still a long way to go getting Bitcoin itself accepted. 
Until we all rally around Bitcoin itself as a fixed supply form of money , we aren't going to the moon.

funny how the main obstructionists are the Blockstream devs.  and no, Garzik does agree that we should increase the limit; he's just not sure when or exactly by how much.  also, Wladimir is "weakly" opposed altho i'm not sure if his opinion has changed since that post. maybe more positive.  both of them can be described by Gavin's "analysis by paralysis".

No one said commercial banks print money. Of course it's central banks that do. 
But why do commercial banks lend out at ratios of 80:1? It's called pushing the envelope to put it mildly to maximize profits. It's just plain reckless speculation.

the problem with the spvp is that it not only allows research SC's, it also enables speculative SC which sell stocks, bonds, insurance, you name it.  even altcoins like Truthcoin.  AND Blockstream has a financial incentive to promote as many of these SC's as possible since they get paid for each one.  
ALSO, the spvp breaks Bitcoins Sound Money function by allowing the spvp to act as an offramp from BTC to all these speculations.  now, instead of being digital cash or digital gold, it is reduced to a WoW like trading platform.  that will paradoxically diminish Bitcoin and its price.

the answer to your "hacked" question is how you view the security community.
if you believe that the NSA itself is the sole source of new, cutting edge cryptographic techniques, then it will be possible to destroy Bitcoin if and when they develop the appropriate hack.  this would be essentially a belief in the benefits of centralization.
otoh, if you  believe that these same cutting edge cryptographic solutions come from the private community first, such as from academia and the broader population, then you might believe that Bitcoin can continuously stay one step ahead of a centralized hacker/attacker.  this would be a belief in open source development. or in other words, the more ppl looking at and contributing/developing code and cryptographic techniques, the better and more secure Bitcoin will be.
the evolution of computing security suggests the latter is the optimum solution.
@_date: 2014-11-29 11:41:54
It's because of bitcoin that these security concerns are coming to the forefront.

burning BTC to participate in CP seemed kinda stupid to me too.  but it was a one time thing and not presented as a peg, like BS is doing.  which to me is more Trojan Horse like.  also, the fact that 2 core devs and 3 commiters are in BS bothers me too from a core dev standpoint.  i'm not the only one bugged by this as this thread and others has demonstrated.  who's to know whether or not the last year of Bitcoin protocol dev stagnation is from the fact that these guys have been planning BS for over a year?
yes, i don't like the fact that the protocol needs to be changed to facilitate the above conflict of interest.  esp when it comes down to a public money good like Bitcoin.
and finally, i'm still not convinced that SC's will "extend" Bitcoin's functionalilty.  this probably comes down to a philosophical difference btwn us as to what Bitcoin represents.  to me, it's always been an investment or a SOV rather than a payment network or asset exchange.

I'm being perfectly genuine when I make that claim. I think privacy is a constitutional right even though I have nothing to hide. Why does a small group of unelected men get to throw the privacy rights of an entire nation under the bus for an unproven threat like bitcoin? I've not seen any statistics to support their claims. Actually, they deprived us if our privacy well before bitcoin came along. 
There's a $1.8B black market out there that's causing all sorts of pain and anguish. They should focus on that. 
What's going unsaid in this whole debate is that gubmints are desperately trying to stop their people from making a free choice in the money they choose. They are literally scared to lose their power. Without all the obstructions to date, Bitcoin would be much higher in price and much greater in economic might.

There are all sorts of economic death wishes throughout this proposal. By definition, lower sidechain security means lower value of those bitcoins. And it's going to fluctuate wildly while over there. And if the sidechain gets hacked those bitcoins are gone.

It's does produce a huge benefit for Bitcoin: Confidence. Confidence that the network is secure and that it should take thousands of times the top 500 supercomputers in the world to attack the network.

@_date: 2015-05-25 14:21:44
We'll see. I actually think it won't. Bitcoin is completely fire walled off from the rest of the system in terms of its fixed supply. No other system or commodity is like that. Bitcoin is far enough along now where we know it has a future. In fact, some may say trouble in the traditional system is indicative of a transition. That does take faith though.

@_date: 2014-02-18 03:00:11
Totally disagree. 
Financialization came about as a result of depegging from gold which allowed widespread fiat recklessness known as money printing and bailouts. This is what lead to the concept of EROEI; from resource abuse and speculation. 
A gold standard may have prevented all this but today it is not the answer; Bitcoin is. And we will not have Armageddon as you imply. Bitcoin will actually save us and the Internet will flourish amidst challenges. 
Your hypothesis of a Google or Apple currency indicate that you don't understand the main concept behind Bitcoin; decentralization.

Which must drive computer scientists mad, huh? I would assume most, if not all other protocols out there do have complete definitions as you've defined, whereas for Bitcoin, Satoshi basically threw together a bunch of code and ideas from a multitude of different disciplines, bootstrapped the entire thing off his mining computer and off it went. No wonder Bitcoin is such a conundrum for even those who might be expected to understand it best.

Bitcoin needs to spread out for security purposes and decentralization. Right now usage is constrained to the USA and Europe. That means enabling it in places like Africa, Asia and the Middle East. But for that to happen, those people cannot have an experience of unconfirmed TX's that goes on for hours.

stop mischaracterizing what we're saying as being inconsistent with those goals.  
you have to ask yourself why most SV startups go strongly after market share in their early years.  companies like Uber and AirBnB.  they're trying to grab mkt share and develop momentum *before* permissioned regulations can catch them.  
Bitcoin needs to do this at this stage of the game.  it needs to spread far and wide round the world so that no one gvt can capture it.  you're being short sighted.

but the security of the sidechain can never be the same as the mainchain b/c not all miners will merge mine.  that, in itself, will make the sidechains less valuable.  then take the situation where a sidechain is subject to a 51% attack and goes to zero.  what happens then?

parse words all you want.  the fact they the IRS defined it as property causes increased difficulty in transacting every cup of coffee as the gains need to be tracked meticulously.  this is obstructive. not that i'd prefer to pay higher tax rates but my point stands.  it's clear they steered around defining it as a currency b/c they didn't want to acknowledge its competition with the USD.  this is clear as day.

Greg, you're just going way overboard with your opposition.  now you're just spreading FUD.  do you really want to do this?


and as for this, let me just present the other side to be fair.  we know from the timeline you were planning Blockstream as a founder since somewhere in mid 2013 when you met with a bunch of your buddies in some remote wooden cabin.  a skeptic would say, no wonder nothing has gotten done with expanding Bitcoin Core ever since then and why Gavin is so frustrated.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:08:29
but what of the -dbcache default of 100MB which nobody touches?
@_date: 2015-05-05 04:14:35
no, your assertion doesn't make sense.
first off, mining pools are made up of aggregations of individual or small group miners who can defect at the first sign of impropriety.  second, making large blocks come with a price; poorer propagation across the network and risk of losing a block race.  third, you said that large miners make it harder for individuals to run full nodes.  that's a tenuous assertion as disk storage costs are plummeting.  you can buy a 3TB disk for $69 new on Best Buy.  eBay sells the same disk for $12.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:22:58
actually, the part i laughed hardest about was Peter's claim that 2 core devs, gmax &amp; LukeJr, have claimed they will NOT be able to afford running a full node if we go to 20MB!!!  lol!  are you kidding me?  
first off, if Gavin's calcs are correct, what they're claiming is ludicrous.
second, let's say it does cost more to run one.  even a lot more.  i know i WILL do it to protect the network.  and if i can afford it, i'm sure they can.
that's how ludicrous their arguments have become.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:36:20

no, if it's money then the IRS should have defined it as a currency for tax purposes and acknowledged Bitcoin as money.  they did not.  what's so hard to understand about that?  you're the one twisting words to sacrifice the big picture.
also, as i've already pointed out, the big picture is that they've also treated early adopters like gox and Shrem inconsistently compared to banks.

i can tell you're a noob.
this is nowhere near the first.  this is just another in a long line of scams from MyBitcoin, Pirate, Bitcoinica, Intersango, Ubitex, etc, etc.  get used to it.  these are normal growing pains for a nascent currency.
what has been the result?  ginormous gains in the Bitcoin economy through it all.  i LIKE the volatility.  it screens out the weak sisters and the anti-fragility brings in much stronger, committed players in the long run.  nothing can be expected to go up in a straight 45 degree line.  there has to be winners and losers on the way to the ultimate fair market value; which happens to be way higher than where we are now.  bull markets shake off as many ppl on the way up.  very few will make it to the end.  it just takes time and patience and Bitcoin is for the smart ppl who take the time to understand the technology and not just out for a quick buck which is who most of the ppl are who left money on gox.  they were planning quick exits on day trading.  they've gotten their hands slapped and rightfully so.
there should be little to no regulation of such a promising technology as Bitcoin at the beginning.  we can add that later when it becomes more clear where this is headed.

Malice is probably slightly too strong of a word, however, do I think if it came down to it in choosing success of Blockstream through sidechains versus success of Bitcoin, yes, I think he chooses the former. Why? Because in the sidechains white paper he sees no problem with all Bitcoiners having to move to a new successful sidechain if it was dominating. Do you see how rich he would become if that had to happen? And how badly existing cold storage holders of Bitcoin would lose? 
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:04:32

we need this type of dedicated POW system to secure a powerful new form of money that has the potential to change the financial world.  and it needs to be secured by the real world costs of electricity and hardware.  
that real world cost is what stops lazy corrupt actors/paper pushers from attacking the system.  if you stop to think about it, the Fed Reserve system makes it simple to steal real world resources from the masses with merely a few keystrokes.  can't do that with Bitcoin.

i think everyone will switch to XT once it becomes clear that 1MB blocks are failing due to an increase in tx's.  the Core price will plummet.  the network effect of money should continue what is already being reflected in altcoins losing mkt share.  Core would be deprecated in deference to XT.

nice attempt to pin the pejorative term "altcoin" to what in essence will become the new "Bitcoin".  why?  b/c the "majority" of Bitcoiners want this to happen.  you can see it plainly in the polls and the comments.
what "will" happen, is that the 1MB chain will quickly get overwhelmed by a flood of tx's.  when everyone on that chain finds out the system is hopelessly broken and restricted by the core dev apparatchiks who are trying to block this, they will defect by selling their 1MB coins and that chain, plus any small residual value, will plummet.
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:08:33


i completely agree.  and their are at least 3 polls i know of, including mine, that show approx 80% approval for Gavin's proposal.

@_date: 2015-05-30 15:52:38
i hear you.
but i think this is a situation in which you have to trust in the economics of self preservation being employed by miners.  if the cap was lifted entirely, miners won't mine long term at a loss.  they will be forced in aggregate to mine profitably, probably at utility sized rates (as banking should ideally be).  nothing like losing money to encourage *swift* changes to one's economic model.
even with no cap, miners should construct smallish blocks mainly to capture block rewards, as fees will still be insignificant.  over the years, a smooth transition should take place.  nothing sudden.
i don't find it personally helpful to focus so much on edge attacks by non-economic miners as this project is open source with a fixed supply of BTC which incentivizes proper behavior which overwhelms bad behavior.

as far as the currency vs BC argument, BC tech was invented by Satoshi precisely to avoid state censorship.  since banks and most corporations aren't trying to avoid the state there is no reason to utilize BC's.  who cares about increased transparency when they will be controlling the outcomes if anything goes wrong?  if anything, banks covet their proprietary finances today.  it's what gives them advantages over smaller banks and each other.  their SQL databases are going just fine in this regard.

i think the money that has been invested in Blockstream has so distorted their vision of things that they will *never* see a problem with 1MB blocks.
LukeJr's recent unconcern about the Stress Tests, just revealed today, are highly illuminating.  i paraphrase, "no problem, the network is working it out just fine.  nevermind the delays, they'll go thru eventually".
it's this type of attitude that tells me they will never want a solution.  the price of Bitcoin could be plunging, miner tx fees could be skyrocketing, user growth could be stunted, and they would explain it all away as a good thing.  
sorry to be such a downer but that is exactly how i see it.  and this is based on my interactions and observations since Jan 2011 of my involvement in Bitcoin.

the problem with core devs deciding *any* block size limit is that they essentially become central bankers, ie, unilaterally determining everyone's cost of accessing the network.  by what metric can they *ever* determine what size is appropriate given most of Bitcoin's incentives are economically and game theoretically driven?  better to let the free mkt of miners and users work that out via mutually determined fees.

I actually would highly doubt this. Greg has talked bearishly about bitcoin for as long as I've listened to him and that is since 2011. Mostly around his fears of centralization in mining. Go back and look in Bitcoin talk. 
I also would think his potential to increase the value of his stock holdings in Blockstream are significant. 
Look, he has a fiduciary responsibility as founder of Blockstream to do what it takes to increase the value of the $21M invested in him by 10x.. Can this not be more clear? Do you really think the high power investors who put their money behind those core devs weren't thinking they were getting an inside lane into Bitcoin Core development? Is it not more clear they are voting in this matter as a block, no pun intended? 
There are over 200 pages of debate in my gold thread where I predicted this type of behavior coming from just this Blockstream group back in October when their white paper was released. We are now seeing the consequences.

assuming an attacker starts flooding the network with unconf tx's with fees.  over a prolonged time, it's also reasonable for competing users trying to get into a block to raise their fees.  almost all miners will see this and start selectively including only the highest fee tx's into their blocks.  at some pt, the fees should go parabolic thus dampening the effect of the attack or even eliminating it.

if that were the case, you would be seeing them forming large blocks  now.  but they're not.  if anything, the incentive is to create smaller blocks so they propagate faster across the network.  if anything, setting the limit at 20MB will take the equilibrium block size higher allowing growth of the network.


the problem with this assertion is that it is a static snapshot analysis of costs today.  you're not accounting for improvements in storage space and bandwidth.  also, Gavin's IBLT proposal decreases bandwidth needs significantly.

Because at the time all users had to download entire block chain and thus were exposed to ddos attacks by bloated blocks. Now we have plenty of other clients, especially SPV wallets, that don't require that so they can't be kicked off the network by such an attack.

@_date: 2015-05-07 16:50:50
ok, that's fine.  but that still doesn't excuse the fact that this has been an ecological disaster in your mind that is still waiting to happen.  and is unlikely to happen as the hashrate is decentralizing, not centralizing as the chart shows.  and this is to be expected given the price volatility.  when we're in a bull, deep pocketed mining investors get excited and go take loans to buy the latest mining equipment driving up hashrate and causing more centralization.  when price falls, the over exuberant get punished, go out of business and we decentralize once again.
also, as 14 nm asic chip tech begins to force a temporary ceiling on hashing capabilities hardware gets commoditized back into the hands of smaller miners who can benefit from lower prices from increased sales competition btwn hardware manufacturers.  we've seen great evidence of this over the last year.  
stop worrying so much.

@_date: 2015-05-06 16:00:24


i actually disagree with Gavin on this part.  "noticed" would certainly apply to usage of the network as a whole.  but on an individual basis, it will probably be harder to be noticed.  this leverages on the principle of "hiding within a crowd".  the more users that adopt Bitcoin, the harder it will be to track down, care about, and even notice individual behaviors.  at some pt, usage gets so widely adopted that gvts will just capitulate to the idea that this is truly what their ppl want to use and transact with.  in that sense, Bitcoin needs to do an Uber and scarf up as many new users as fast as possible to get an unstoppable momentum going.  that is why we need to expand block sizes to 20MB now.
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:09:31
Depends on how efficient 21's chips are (probably good especially since they'll be scalable), if you paid almost nothing for the phone (probably, if the phone manufacturer wants to capture that billion extra 3rd world customers), if you're unemployed (free money) , and if the price of Bitcoin is rising (could be very profitable) .

let me ask you this.  
if 20MB blocks were implemented today, would you think the price jumps to **$4600**/BTC today?  you'd say no, i'd bet.
but you'd have to question why not b/c of this:
so if you don't believe the price would jump to that $460 (20x), why would you think the block size would immediately jump to 20MB?
the answer is it won't.  it will slowly grow over time, maybe years.  and if so, the OP's point stands.  Nielsen's Law should prevent any problems.
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:01:33

depends on how you look at it.  all those mines being in China is probably what's stopping the USG from coercing US based mines into destroying Bitcoin.  the Chinese realize that Bitcoin can challenge the USD thus they won't touch their mines for fear of destroying the confidence that Bitcoin has rightfully earned.  this fact, puts the USG on notice that, if anything, they should encourage the deveopment of mines here in the US.

ah, that's the recognizable term i was looking for.  this idea of 0 value outputs causing UTXO set bloat as an attack had me worried there.  but since these are non-std tx's being under the dust limit, then no miner in their right mind would include them in a block thus negating the attack for the most part.  this is why we haven't seen it.

this is only b/c we've been in a bear mkt for the speculative exchange *price*.  these prices move in cycles and we have bottomed out.  once the price starts rising again, nodes will rise in lock step as individuals and merchants will have more incentive to "protect" their investment.

Makes perfect sense. Your input is invaluable and needs to be heard and expressed especially given your past responsible behavior. 
BTW, I feel strongly the incentives are for device manufacturers to run their own pools if they are willing to put 21 mining chips into their devices. As companies transacting in Bitcoin, they are going to want to run their own full nodes so why not the pool? Is just a server after all and the expertise to secure it. You would know.

Even if mining were unprofitable, the synergistic effects of an onboard hardware wallet plus the connectivity of a large network are going to produce great value whether you like it or not. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:35:35
the analogy is a *small group of ppl*, in this case core devs, are deciding how much it will cost for participants to engage with Bitcoin and how much miners deserve to get paid in tx fees.  how can any small group of ppl make those decisions?
tx fees should be directly negotiated by the broadest number of participants in the mkt; in this case btwn the users and the miners.  and don't think that miners won't take into consideration the technical limitations of the network.  they will *have* to.

@_date: 2015-05-31 18:07:41
your attack scenario also assumes miners don't react to a prolonged flood attack.  i think they will.  for instance, they could block all tx's from a perceived attacker.  or force the attacker to continuously raise the fees paid to maximally rape him.  the latter wouldn't necessarily be the best for the network but maybe it would as their long term profits would escalate and provide profit margins for when the attack eventually is forced to stop.

there's a real danger here that if the other 1MB core devs don't get off their asses and help out Gavin &amp; Mike, their roles as core devs could be relegated to the dustbin of history.  this is a great chance for those talented devs who have felt rejected or humiliated from the likes of current core devs to get their foot in the door.  we clearly know they exist and in great   core dev is a highly coveted position leading to all sorts of great opportunities as the Blockstream core dev's refusal to step down in the name of conflict of interest very well demonstrates.
@_date: 2014-05-06 02:02:23
no one has a financial incentive to set up a sidechain except the company who decides to do so leading to centralization like you said.  
actually that's fine as long as they don't use their political influence, like gmax and Adam, to change the core protocol to facilitate their profit.  which is exactly what they're proposing to do.  which is exactly why i'm objecting so strongly.
read this from Satoshi:  
the part i like best is this:
*The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.*
now, if Adam's company can accomplish what they want by just using script while not introducing an ugly hack into the main protocol, then ok.  but that's not what they're trying to do according to Peter Todd:

that's a good pt about 20MB blocks being trivial to attack as well for a non-economic agent.  someone made a great proposal to have fees approach infinity as the unconf tx set grows.  problem is there is no limit to that data set reflective of what will clog a block nor how that will effect any one nodes mempool limits.  that needs a solution.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:55:31


this is where you fail at understanding what is going on.
the drop could easily be explained by the price drop.  speculative mkts move in cycles and for the last 1.5 yr we have been in a bear.  understandable given the degree of the speculative runup.  bull mkts rarely bring everyone along and full nodes and miners are no exception.  the majority will lose money in Bitcoin.  a simple turn around in the mkt would immediately result in an increase in full nodes, merchants, users and miners.  but the system has to *work* for that to happen and that means no block limit breakage.
get with it.

you also need to worry about feedback negative effects on the Bitcoin mainchain as well.  if a sidechain loses 20-30% of all BTC to a sidechain collapse that would be horrific for Bitcoin itself.
you can expect a non-economic malicious attacker to wait for an opportune time to do this, like a gov't or bank, as merge mining will be inherently less secure.

second, i can tell you that all the top tier chip makers are booked out months in advance and you have to get in line. the wait lengths are well known. somebody would notice if suddenly wait times went from 2 months to 4 months without an explanation. there are also plenty of insiders within those companies who have no allegiance to gov'ts. most are overseas.

it's actually an interesting idea to create a UTXO Merkle root in general.  we've been having a similar discussion in my gold thread but for a different purpose.  
a continuously updated realtime UTXO Merkle root could be created from the continuously changing UTXO set and then embedded into each block.  this could then serve as a fully verifiable reference point to crosscheck against a UTXO set downloaded from a sampling of trustless nodes for either an SPV client or a new full node that can't or doesn't want to download the full blockchain.  is there someway your idea and use purpose could be dovetailed with this idea?

1.  if say 20% of current bitcoins get lost on a sidechain from an attack over time, what economic effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem would you see?
2.  as Bitcoin has not had any major irreversible problems to this point, how can one justify making such a change to the protocol to help facilitate a for profit company?
3.  if there was an economic way to rein in the scamcoin situation wouldn't it be prudent to try it first as opposed to risking the entire Bitcoin network with a protocol change?
4.  if changing the protocol were so simple, why did we get the 0.7 to 0.8 fork?

I would phrase it a little different than Barry:
Miners mine because they're motivated to make money; a new form of fixed supply money that has the potential to change finance because of its gold like properties. A pre-designed side effect of the POW concept and decentralized design of the network is that the security of the blockchain network has become enormous and impervious to nation state attack whose currencies Bitcoin was designed to compete with. What we're also witnessing at the same time is the will of the people at work who are beginning to support the work of these miners. 
Unlike the Hyperledgers and banks of the 2.0 source, miners don't have a collective need or goal to trust each other or act in concert to achieve a particular financial objective dependent on a centralized block chain. .

Regardless, what's all this focus on a kid who may have helped in selling a million at most of who knows what on silk road when we have billions laundered through banks and no one goes to prison because it might perturb our financial system. First of all, how convenient for bank employees. Second, there's no proof that's true. Third, it pisses off ordinary people and rightfully so. Fourth, these enormous bailouts encumber our children. Finally, it devalues our money.  And they wonder what's the problem. 
What kind of message does prosecuting Charlie say? He was fully cooperating and educating them for months prior to his arrest. Publicly be was advocating for regulation. And they do this to him? 
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:11:07

You're right, Shrem hasn't been proven guilty yet. And even if he is, the buying and selling of drugs by individuals is not money laundering.

At 14:11 of this video we find out that the "core devs" involved in this for profit company are gmax, Adam Back (never knew he was a core dev), and a guy I've never heard of before, Mark Friedenbach.
They intend to create sidechains that will be sold on to institutions, corporations, and gubmints. 
So we're going to modify/risk the protocol to allow this type of activity? IMO, sidechains are going to be nothing but a leech on the Bitcoin system. They "need" Bitcoins value and mining capacity to succeed.

@_date: 2016-03-13 16:30:40
Those banks operate in an entirely different type of financial system. It's called fiat. A system where unlimited printing of money encourages the leverage and speculation you speak of. One where bailouts are commonplace and the money supply is controlled by a small cabal of centralized elite. 
Bitcoin allows none of that moral hazard. Which is why we're all here. And miners have an infinite incentive to survive because they stand a great chance of becoming accountants aka the new stewards in this new and revolutionary monetary system. If Bitcoin is allowed to become the p2p ecash system that Satoshi envisioned, the BTC holdings that the miners have and will accumulate will skyrocket as all that fiat from the Forex markets get sucked into the system. 
We'll see if that growth will be allowed.

how would an attacker bloat the UTXO set with these 0 value UTXO's?
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:25:53
the way i would answer this is where is the tripling of tx's and the fees required to mine a 3MB vs 1MB block going to come from?  
if that miner is an attacker, would he manufacture his own fake tx's to create a 3MB block?  no.  it would be too expensive and risky for him to do so, not only from time and energy needed to create them and hash them into a valid POW but also in terms of foregone block rewards that he might miss from being orphaned and screwing around with the system.
@_date: 2015-05-07 10:09:46
What matters is where they have ended up: a measly 3%. You have no idea why they persisted at around 40%. Maybe they had a lag from hardware coming on-board from previous orders for their mining contracts . It took time for the word to get out of what they had done. What's important and what you keep over looking is what the market eventually did to them. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:48:11
i think the way to look at this is in terms of increasing  and the block size limit of 1MB currently.  if Nasdaq really cranks up the volume of tx's, which would be a good thing, it will cause the limit to be hit thus forcing up tx fees to unacceptable levels.  if the 1MB proponents want entities like Nasdaq to continue using the blockchain, as they should, this should force the block limit to be raised.  hopefully this should result in a long term solution to increasing block size.  
to the extent that this contributes to solving the block size problem, this will result in others using the blockchain as well for ordinary uses.  growth like this should result in greater demand for the BTC unit over time.

sure they can.  they can and probably will just do a look back over the last 1000 blocks or so and won't vary too much from that average.  the incentive right now will still be to create the smallest most efficient block for propagation once found for maximum block rewards.  
this "large" miner crap i keep hearing about forming exceptionally large blocks to try and eliminate competition is hogwash.  it's too risky.  game theory suggests that in an open market such as we have with mining, it's most prudent for these large miners to do what they do best; create blocks as fast as they can to harvest block rewards.  and NOT to play games concentrating on what financial pain they "might" be able to inflict on smaller miners.  that would be fools play b/c just b/c a small miner may be small doesn't mean they aren't well capitalized and running on a more efficient budget than the larger miner.  there would be no guarantee of success in terms of driving them out of the market while the risk for large miners would be in losing blocks from slow propagation.  best for large miners to take advantage of what they know and can reliably calculate than what they don't know and can only guess.

the open, competitive business of mining forces all miners to be as efficient as possible and to play by the rules.  any large miner trying to drive out smaller miners by artificially creating large cumbersome blocks will only drive themselves out by being slow to propagate their bloat across the network.  smaller, faster, and more honest nodes would eat their lunch.

hey, i've done it!  Unconfirmed tx &amp; Unspent txo's both start with Un- !
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:04:41


like you said, it will take years to implement LN.  while i like the fact that at least it is on mainchain, the parts i don't particularly like are 1. req several soft forks  2.  requires a block size increase also  3.  req 24/7 trusted LN gateway nodes that could be data mined  4. seems overly complex altho i could be wrong on this.


could be solved by pruning and IBLT


even if implemented, can you be sure Bitcoin tx's will EVER grow to 20MB?  ans: NO.  and if it does, it will be slowly and theoretically tech will advance in lock step.  20MB in bandwidth is not trivial today but may be, or not, in 5y.


this is where yesterdays Stress Test is highly illuminating in many ways (esp in the interpretation of the results).  i happen to think it is alarming that essentially 2 dudes on Reddit could clog the network for 8h from 1h worth of tx's.  that is an easy attack that ANYONE can implement, not just a large miner.  it is bad for user experience and hence growth.  i also think it is irresponsible for certain devs to make the interpretation of "no problem".


on it's face, it is. but i would say to be valid there ideally should be an underlying condition at it's core; all actors are financially unbiased.  the way i look at it is that Gavin &amp; Wladimir are the only 2 core devs w/o a clear financial conflict.  if you then say that Wlad is "weakly" no, i would respond by saying Gavin is "strongly" yes, so on balance we go forward with Gavin.  that's a twisted argument however, so my original argument still stands; we should discount financial bias.
another pt.  there are at least 3 polls showing approx 80% approval for increasing block size.  what are the core devs obligations to the community to consider these?  user and now apparently merchants   all want larger blocks.  i say it's irresponsible to use the "consensus" argument against them.

Non standard to who? 
Old nodes see them as valid and will relay them around the network to other old nodes; which presumably there will be alot of given the low uptake of Satoshi 0.12 at 23%. Maybe as high as 77% if you assume today's breakdown holds. Old nodes only see the message data structure without its signature so they are reduced to SPV node capability and assume the tx is valid even if it may not be. If this is a double spend then this fraud will be propagated across 77% of the network at the extremes.

There is no basis for that statement especially given that they are the original sources of information where most of the early and new adopters hang out as well as arguably the miners and exchange operators from China for general information. Unless you have statistics that say otherwise.

i'm not worried about centralization in Bitcoin. in fact, i think we've seen the last of pools reach 51% with ghash.  asic hardware is leveling off in development and soon commoditization will occur.  we've already seen 10x drop in hardware prices and it will continue and swing the pendulum back towards small miners.
Sidechains will require merge mining and leads to centralization however as not all current Bitcoin miners will agree to MM a sidechain.  those that do, however, will be very concentrated in power. for ex: if Discus and ghash were the only 2 to MM a SC, Discus could immediately do a 51% attack.

well, ya gotta believer that Apple et al are aware of these issues:
*Secure Channel for NFC-Establishing a secure channel between two NFC
devices is clearly the best approach to protect against
eavesdropping, data modification attack, and enhance
the inherent protection of NFC against Man in the Middle Attacks. A standard key agreement protocol like Diffie Hellmann based on RSA [4] or Elliptic Curves could be applied to establish a shared secret between
two devices. The shared secret can then be used to
derive a symmetric key like 3DES or AES, which is then
used for the secure channel providing confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity of the transmitted data.
Various modes of operation for 3DES and AES could be used for
such a secure channel and can be found in literature [3].*

A few tidbits for cold storage use:
1. Use bitaddress.org to print out a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet with qr codes. Make another paper copy and cut out the private key and address. Laminate both, back to back, to credit card size. Stick in wallet for carrying around. This way you can lose the private key qr code and not worry. 
2. Throw original paper wallet copy in safe. 
3. scan the corresponding  address into Mycelium to display on home screen as a watching only address or to receive payments when necessary. 
A request to devs: the qr code address I mention above doesn't display fully on home screen for some reason. 
Also, when I click on pay link for some merchants, Mycelium will automatically open up but to a blank screen. 
Lastly, what's the proper way to close Mycelium to wipe the key from memory?

massive growth of the network is actually what we need right now. if Bitcoin is going to try and mimic physical gold, it needs to saturate populations worldwide.  a universal money has to be universal.  the only way for this confidence to develop for a virtual currency is for the payment network itself to be expansive, inexpensive, easy to use, and most important reliable.  bumping up against the 1MB limit will clearly cause unreliability causing Bitcoin to never realize itself as "digital gold".

running a Bitcoin business should be all the incentive one needs to ensure proper tx handling and up to date data.  but we first need cheap, easy, reliable tx's for users before we get merchant growth to meet them.  the last 2 yrs have been spent doing it backwards; merchants before users.  this is why Bitcoin is struggling.  
it's time to grow the user base from all corners of the planet.

peer reviewed *within a small select group of core devs*.  mind you, it could be the greatest thing since sliced bread but i'd have alot more trust in it if it received more *unbiased* peer review over a much longer *documented* time period that the community could verify and fact check.  that didn't happen  and like i said, given Maxwell's suspicious disappearance with his possible connection to the Juniper Systems backdoor scandal, his libsecp256k1 algo inventions should get a second review by unbiased parties, imo.

@_date: 2016-01-26 16:44:27
from Dave Harding:
*segwit only fixes signer malleability for m-of-n multisig where at least one of the original signatures is included in the replacement transaction. Signer malleability for single-signature transactions or where an entirely new set of m signatures is used in multisig is still a possible form of malleability. This is easy to prove: the necessary set of signers can change the vouts, the nSequence, the locktime, or the the version number, thus changing the txid even when segwit is used for every scriptSig.*
i didn't realize the fix was only for this specific condition.  bummer.

@_date: 2015-05-08 17:03:16
even core devs want to make money.  2 of the core devs and 3 of the top committers are equity investors/founders of Blockstream.  they have $21M invested from top VC's and other luminaries from the Valley.  Sidechains move tx's offchain and could be worth billions if successful.  it's those devs fiduciary responsibility to make money for the company, typically a 10x return on invested capital.  
you need to take these facts into consideration.

Greg is to be taken with a grain of salt as he has $21M invested in him thru Blockstream that says he will be able to divert much of the tx volume to SC's which will produce a 10x return for his investors.
Greg is a great cryptographer though.  but this issue more revolves around politics and economics which are not his bailiwick.

@_date: 2016-03-07 16:10:58
you'll never be able to smooth out fee volatility in your 1MB "fee mkt".  problem being, mempool congestion is not only a lagging phenomenon but quite a persistent one at that.  what will make that even worse is the ability to do CPFP which keeps both the parent and child tx's in the mempool creating even more congestion.  and i say lagging b/c of the instant on/off nature of spamming.  an attacker will be able to play havoc with fee volatility as a result of jumping in and out.  just look closely at the high variation of the fees paid over the last several spam attacks that have only became possible since last July when blocks started getting full above 750kB.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:41:50
not at all.  miners have said numerous times that the reward is their main objective right now.  tx fees are small in comparison.

Every country should have a USD hedge. 
Show a multi year graph of the US monetary supply especially the last 100 years. Show a graph of the Roman candle spike in the excess reserves. That's always impressive to highlight what is being done to prop up the system at the expense of the USD. Show the graph of dwindling monetary velocity as a hint that the recovery is really abysmal and not reflective of the stock market. All these graphs can be found here ;
A wealth disparity graph in the US would also help. 
Then contrast all of the above by showing the long term price graph of bitcoin along with a graph of the hash rate growth. 
Then show pictures of the huge bitcoin mines in Iceland, Hong Kong, China, and Sweden. 
Make the point that THIS is why bitcoin is taking off. It's because the clear monetary inflation is only helping certain people closest to the monetary spigots. Ordinary people are flocking to an alternative system that treats them fairly by not being inflationary and is ruled by the tight regulation of mathematics, not men.

that's not true.  the purpose of full nodes is to verify and relay blocks, not restrain them through blocksize judgments.  if you want to set a limit then run BU.  it allows for that.

you know full well you're distorting the truth here.  a rogue ghash employee exploited a poorly run dice site accepting 0 confs.  anyone can do that. it doesn't require 51% of the network.  furthermore, look at the consequences of cheating; ghash now a mere pitiful 3% of the network.  individual miners, who are the ones who compose pools btw, punished them accordingly.

It will propagate through the part of the non upgraded p2p network, which is hugely significant at this point, since this is being done as a SF and we're dealing with ANYONECANSPEND's. There's objective risk and we should be looking at all adversarial scenarios.

as far as the currency vs BC argument, BC tech was invented by Satoshi precisely to avoid state censorship.  since banks and most corporations aren't trying to avoid the state there is no reason to utilize BC's.  who cares about increased transparency when they will be controlling the outcomes if anything goes wrong?  if anything, banks covet their proprietary financial ledgers today.  it's what gives them advantages over smaller banks and each other.  their SQL databases are going just fine in this regard.

who are you and what's your relation to Blockstream?
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:54:42


i think the reverse happens (mass selling of XBT), especially if 80% of miners (in your example) switch to XBX and if my poll and the github poll are reflective of the economic majority.  
Nash equilibrium would suggest that everyone will not only do what's best for themselves individually, but what is best for "the group".  what's best for the group encourages everyone to work together on one chain and i think in this case that would be XBX.  why? b/c this behavior would be consistent with growth of the internet which will eventually touch all ppl round the world.  block size growth will allow Bitcoin to do the same.
@_date: 2015-05-08 13:54:31

That's how badly they want it.

forex markets are the largest on the planet.  you think all those ppl involved in those markets looking to make money are ignorant?
it's quite a valid concept to invest in a currency to make profits.  look at what Soros did with the pound.  the proper way to look at the investment universe is that currencies and gold have their own baskets equal to that of equity markets.  if you had dumped your stocks in 2007 and gone long USD you would've made a fortune by March 2009, not just by avoiding the stock crash but by the increase in the USD value as ppl were fleeing to safety.

first off, having a secure hardware wallet pre-installed on the phone will turn an unbanked 3rd world person into a banked one via a discounted phone.  now he/she can engage in commerce either over the internet or even p2p in his local marketplace.
second, if 21 is successful in disseminating mining phones widely, the decentralization of mining could be perceived quite favorably in the marketplace as that is a favorite criticism of Bitcoin today.  as a result, the price of Bitcoin could start rising again making these phones/devices quite desirable.
third, if the bits accumulated on a phone or device enables interactive commerce as described in the audio, who knows what positive effects that could generate.

you keep holding up this banner that there should *never* be a hard fork.  i think that's wrong.  one of the main tenets that Bitcoin has held from the beginning was that it could deal with threats by adapting.  that means updating or changing the code.  
how do you know there won't ever be enough users or tx's to fill a 80MB block?  you use the technical limitation argument as if you can see the future.  i, at least, admit i can't see the future but i do know that if at all possible, onchain tx fees should be the goal to sustain the mining industry for maximum security and decentralization.  we need to at least try to achieve this instead of trying to layer a *much* more complex, untested *conceptualized* layer 2 system onto Bitcoin in the far futrue when we know we have a problem to be solved today.

his was a very simplified simulation and didn't take into acct things like the GFC, like you pt out, nor the relay network.

hey, quick question.
followed your instructions and it's up and running but when i go to Bitnodes to check the version, it doesn't give any indication of "UTXO" which would indicate XT is running.  what was odd is that when i ran "bitcoin-cli getinfo" *immediately* after starting it up with "bitcoind -daemon" i got a return showing uptodate blocks and 76 connections, *as if Core had never been removed and was still connected*.  that was 2d ago.
is it possible to still have Core installed and running after what appeared to be a successful switch to XT even after having run "sudo apt-get remove bitcoind"?

and what if the SC presents an innovation that b/c of political reasons won't get backported to the MC thus causing it to be dominant with it's relative price increasing vs the MC's price decreasing? 


i think you meant the other way around; the MC miners merge mine the SC.  anyways, i agree that the MC will have the higher hashrate making the SC vulnerable.  i still think it's possible for the SC to attract it's own primary miners though thus leeching mining power and fees away from the MC.


you did read the part about how SC tokens can transfer directly to other SC's w/o having to go thru a hub like the MC?  i'm not sure if that applies to scBTC though.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:11:26
OK, pick your spamming fee. How about 0.0002? Well, real users could simply pay 0.00025 to get in. OR, the miners can set their minfee to 0.00025 to limit their mempools. So could nodes. OR, miners could just choose to ignore the spam. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:20:56
why not when they are the ones most economically involved along with users?  they also are the only ones who have access to their own internal accounting which make for prudent decisions concerning their profitability.  certainly core devs don't have this info nor are economically at risk so they for sure shouldn't be the one's controlling block size to establish a "fee mkt".

essentially what Blockstream wants to do is redirect mainchain mining fees to offchain fees paid to centralized servers hubs like federated sidechains and LN gateways, not to mention consulting fees to construct these alternative inferior security systems.
in addition, before any corporation puts a dime on the table to Blockstream, they will insist on an airtight "non-compete clause" that prevents any backporting of *any* innovation the sidechain introduces back to the Bitcoin mainchain.  it's the responsible thing to do to maintain their edge and protect their investment.  unless of course, you're willing to believe they will be just as benevolent towards Bitcoin as reportedly Blockstream is claimed to be.

Mark, watch this video and think of the guys at the table being miners, large and small, and the blonde as any mining attack you care to insert:
in essence, large miners shouldn't want to kill small miners as they know they contribute overall to Bitcoin's security in different regions of the world from which they reside.  the stronger and more distributed the network *overall*, the greater their chances that the coins they own will moon.  thus, everybody is needed small and large, esp at this early stage of Bitcoin, when success is by no means guaranteed.

but only if we lift the block size with a concomitant increase in users and thus tx's which sustains the hashrate and only then causes the price to moon.


but i would expect the Chinese gvt to have to react, if they want to participate significantly in Bitcoin, by relaxing the GFW for miners thus bringing balance back into the equation.


yes, i get that Guy Corem has been working on this by embedding a  key of some sort into hardware within a datacenter that a hasher could verify.


it can't be a settlement network when it hasn't yet displaced gold.  it's too early and weak for that.  in order to replace gold, Bitcoin has to grow orders of magnitude and have transactional usage on the mainchain before anyone will trust it as a settlement layer.


the problem with that is that it removes tx fees from replacing rewards.  that's a huge problem as Towns outlined in the link above.

as weak as Bitcoin is currently being hobbled by the 1MB choke and given the Blockstream core dev reluctance to improve upon this current congestion, i think it would be more likely that we'll have to migrate all our cold wallet BTC to a SC as it becomes dominant.  any corporation that constructs a SC with Blocksteam's assistance will have a non-compete clause drawn up that legally would prevent them from backporting a new innovation.

Bitcoin is mainly about economic theory.  the code is there simply to support that theory.  we see this all the time; coders decide what's best in terms of economics, then code to enforce that.  look at this "fee mkt" argument.  perfect example.  Cripplecoiners have decided that "we need fees now".  thus, they refuse to lift the limit.  code cannot precede the economic idea.  it does not spontaneousl generate itself.  it has to be based on a belief.
furthermore, we constantly see code updates chasing after economic "holes" that get exploited by economic actors.  like the 1MB single tx from f2pool.

That doesn't stop it from still being propagated slowly and getting orphaned. Plus, it greatly narrows the scope of the attack to a malicious large miner who has to construct this non standard tx block which means it has to probably be one of the 5 Chinese miners who already have poor bandwidth connections and won't want to risk orphaning of these blocks on a regular basis which would destroy their reputations like what happened to ghash. .

I've always said I don't have a problem with federated SC's as they don't require a change to the protocol. I don't see the point but I don't have a problem with them as I don't see them harming Bitcoin. But if and when it comes down to inserting the spvp into the protocol, I don't see the advantage except to the insecure SC in siphoning away value and tx fees from the MC.

all Ripple ever was was a layer 2 gateway network that works much the way that federated SC's are being sold.  when they failed to attract Bitcoin use (tho they, and you, tried hard for many years thru lobbying BCT and conferences), they simply defected towards the traditional banking model.  as a result, they got slapped with the fine.
you're making the same mistake with SC's and LN.  they are more centralized than the Bitcoin mainchain and will get slapped somewhere along the line too.
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:45:45
and you're doing better with your assumptions?  the SM paper made alot of miner behavioral assumptions as well which i think are wrong.
the very most basic one being that you assume Chinese miners don't understand that by attacking the ROW mining network, Bitcoin *might* become centralized in China thus causing a plunge in the exchange price as everyone else realizes they don't want to participate in a Bitcoin owned by a communist regime.  or that the ROW mining network actually utilizes the fact that they have better connectivity to actually get up and compete with the Chinese so that the distribution of hashing power becomes *more* decentralized.

@_date: 2015-08-07 12:49:33
I understand everyone's concern. But op is correct to try to get at the right answer even if we can't ever prove it. IOW, I think it's important to ask the question; at least to counter all the incessant attack FUD. for the record, I think that as long as miners have the freedom to construct blocks as they see fit, which they do, and as long as they can charge what they want to do that, which they can, and as long as full nodes can choose to relay and validate what they want, which they do, and as long as users can choose to pay the fees they want, which they do, then we're good. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:56:05
i'm sure you're already aware of Satoshi's vision of specialized data centers running full nodes primarily.  personally if, by lifting the limit, we grow userbase to billions of users, i expect the price to moon accordingly and you and i will be able to afford a datacenter sized full node ;)
i just don't think full nodes should be the emphasis here.  userbase is much more important at this stage as we are too niche/small to ever be considered by anyone to be a viable, secure settlement layer.  you may also have seen this:
great post about why fees must rise to compensate for halving next year; or else suffer a decrease hashrate and security.
TBH, the GFC is a problem that's contributing to choking Bitcoin right now.  in core devs obsession with keeping the top 5 Chinese miners happy, they are sticking with stunted block size increase proposals.  all these advantages that have been accruing to them are hurting mining development elsewhere in the world.  Chinese already have cheaper electricity, cheaper labor, cheaper parts, better manufacturing, etc.  1 or 8MB blocks just make it worse for non Chinese miners.  you should want a more level playing field there which can only come with bigger blocks and more users.

i've been a target since then and the fact that i am now also in favor of bigger blocks has got them royally pissed off as they fear it would mean the end of sidechains and LN. so they retaliate by bringing in unrelated, unproven issues in an attempt at character assassination. it won't work as the 10% commission was legitimately earned. in fact, that's not even in dispute. the allegation is amazingly this with the perfect hindsight of BK, "we paid you too much"!!! and they don't mean from an accounting mistake or fraudulent standpoint. they mean from a subjective standpoint even though it was contractually agreed to btwn ppl other than them. and the fact of the matter is that Hashfast has never been proven to be a scam. they did deliver product some of which is still in use today, as i understand it. they were just a victim of incompetence and bad business timing with the downturn of the market:
Also note the recent age of the weaponized anonymous troll/coward account made just for me.

by lifting the block size limit, their incentives will be perfectly aligned.  they *need* each other for miners to stay in business and be profitable and for users to be able to access and spend in a reasonable fee based manner.  those 2 economic entities are the only one's who should be involved in determining the proper fees; not core dev.

@_date: 2015-08-07 14:31:09
the answer to this is to lift the block limit.  bigger blocks means Chinese miners don't get subsidized anymore as they're caught behind the GFC.  better bandwidth regions outside of China can then compete for the first time allowing competition and further decentralization in mining.

i'll disagree a bit here.  i think it is important to run XT given your scenario.  why?  b/c it is a warning sign to those 2 recalcitrant Core devs you speak of that if they are indeed contentious, XT will be adopted by a majority of the network in a seamless manner.  the only way they would know that is to look at the statistics of how many and what % of nodes are running XT.
remember that by running XT now, you still are verifying/validating/relaying blocks for Core *between now and then*.

no one's saying we should never have an overlay network.  but the first priority is to max out the mainchain when at all possible to maximize the transition of miners from rewards to fees.  this is paramount for security and profitability of mining as well as for as many tx's as possible for the avg user.  you have no way of predicting what type of tech growth will be possible going forward to make this a reality so crippling Bitcoin at this early stage is ludicrous.

see all those continuous full blocks streaming by right now w/o delay (still pretty much every 10 min)?  w/o a limit those same miners will be free to chew thru the mempool and consume the backlog relatively quickly as bigger blocks.  what we've learned from this spam attack is how well the network can hold up to such an attack. what's a shame though is that full nodes have already verified all that spam in the mempool and are waiting for blocks to be formed to clear their mempools.  but they don't come b/c those same unconf tx's in the mempool get deleted every 24h thus returning those spam fees back to the spammer to recycle into new tx's.  rinse, repeat.  we need bigger blocks so the miners can capture those fees and start forcing losses onto the spammer.  jstolfi actually did some calcs showing how expensive it would be for the spammer if blocks were much bigger.  they soar at higher levels.

if tx fees are all diverted off the mainchain, how will miners replace lost block rewards?  here's a great post from Towns on bitcoin-dev:
Anthony Towns via bitcoin-dev
4 days ago
Raw Message
I haven't seen anyone do the (trivial) maths on this. Have I just
missed it? By my count:
- blocks in 25 btc in rewards and about 0.5 btc in fees per block
- at ~$300 USD per btc, that's ~$7,650 per block
- current hashrate is ~400 PH/s; so ~240,000 PH/block works out
to having to spend about 30PH per dollar earnt.
- for comparison,
quotes $1.99 per GH/s for 12 months, which by my count is
60*60*24*365 / 1.99 GH/$ = 15.8 PH per dollar spent
- hashrate growth has slowed from about x4/quarter to x2/year:
sep '13: ~1PH/s
dec '13: ~4PH/s
mar '14: ~20PH/s
jun '14: ~80PH/s
sep '14: ~200PH/s
aug '15: ~400PH/s
- so, as far as I understand it, miners don't make absurd profits compared
to capital investment and running costs
- presumably, then, miners will stop mining bitcoin if the revenue/block
drops significantly at some point
- less miners means a lower hashrate; a lower hashrate makes
50% attacks easier, and that's a bad thing (especially if there's lots
of pre-loved ASIC mining hardware available cheap on ebay or alibaba)
- in about a year, the block reward halves, cutting out 12.5 btc or
~$3750 USD per block. without an increase in fees per block, miners
will just get ~$3900 USD per block
- the last time the reward for mining a block was under $4000 per block
was around oct '13, with a hashrate of ~2PH/s
- 13 btc in fees per block compared to .5 btc in fees per block is a
25x increase; which could be either an increase in fee/txn or
- with ~500 bytes/transaction, that's ~2000 transactions per MB
- 13 btc in fees ($3900) per block means per transaction fees of
$2 for 1MB blocks
$1 for 2MB blocks
25c for 8MB blocks
10c for 20MB blocks
(assuming full blocks, 500 byte txns)
- comparing that to credit card or paypal fees at ~2.5% that's:
$2 -&gt; minimum transaction $80
$1 -&gt; minimum transaction $40
25c -&gt; minimum transaction $10
10c -&gt; minimum transaction $4
- those numbers only depend on the USD/BTC exchange rate in so far as
the more USD for a BTC, the more likely the block reward will pay
for hashrate without transaction fees, even with the reward reduced
to 12.5 btc/block. otherwise it's just USD/txn paying for USD/hashrate
- the reference implementation fee of 0.1mBTC/kB equates to about
3c per transaction (since it rounds up). Even 10c/transaction is more
than a 3x increase on that.
What the above says to me is that even assuming everyone starts paying
fees, the lightning network works great, and so do sidechains and whatever
else, you /still/ want to up the volume of bitcoin txns by something like
an order of magnitude above what's currently allowed within a year or so.

They don't have to validate every tx if they set their minfee high enough. 
Which brings up a good point though. The cap is preventing all those mempool TX's in full nodes from clearing/punishing the spammers. All that wasted validation work. Lift the cap and the ability to increase the mempool goes away. Or at least comes at great risk and expense. I'd argue the cap is a well defined target that allow a minimal expense attack as blocks get full from real tx growth. I'd argue we will have these same attacks at 8 or 20MB blocks as they start to get full. Without a limit, the attacker faces an unknown expensive random walk up trying to jack everyone's mempool.

And Trezor doesn't do that?

fantastic. 
what a great team.
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:18:47
and that would be a mistake.  the simplest way to level the playing field is to open up the block size.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:41:54
why do we never seem to see these types of miner attacks?
the answer is here.  the guys are miners and the blonde is the attack:
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:41:00
Listen to Arthur Levitt say flat out that redundant NY regulatory agencies primary goal is to bring in revenue for the state:
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:12:23
no block size limit.  miners and users are more than capable of negotiating fees on their own w/o core dev artificial caps picking winners and losers.
during this entire stress in the network, my full nodes are sitting here underutilized and unstressed.  contrary to what we were told.
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:30:22


right now Bitcoin is small and weak.  and it's hobbled by the 1MB cap.  i also see the 2wp as a passthrough through which BTC can leave the MC permanently to a SC and end up as scBTC if the SC presents a significant innovation.  and as we have seen with this 1MB obstructiveness, i don't think it's a given that core dev will backport these innovations back to the MC, unfortunately.  i see it as being too early to siphon tx fees and value away from the MC to a SC.  as was stated in their WP, it's possible for a SC to gain dominance and *force* a migration of old BTC out of long term cold wallets over to a SC.  coupled with the fact that there will be separate exchange values btwn BTC and scBTC that you might expect to be equal thru arbitrage, i see it as likely for the BTC price to start to plunge while the scBTC price skyrockets if this *dominance* starts to manifest itself.  that would be a disaster for Bitcoin, imo, as it would destroy the concept of SOV for Bitcoin and relegate the entire cryptocurrency industry to one of a rolling ponzi scheme as ppl sustain massive losses each time this might occur.
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:22:04
but their mere existence as 50 independent men in the framework of the system as it currently stands is centralized no matter what their efforts.
unless of course, their efforts guide the system towards wider user adoption ala the hiding in the crowd effect which i'd argue they'd probably want to do making my original point still valid.
@_date: 2015-08-06 16:18:38
yes.  i edited for clarity.
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:32:03
No it hasn't 
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:34:36
so it's not just the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:19:18


That's exactly what we want. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:00:31
Full nodes have demonstrated clearly that they have easily been able to handle the current spam attack and miners have easily been able to process blocks quickly. There's plenty of capacity to increase the block size. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:42:24
ok, a month ago you and the other BS core devs were arguing that large miners due to superior connectivity could attack small miners with large blocks:  
now you're saying block verification times are trivial, as are propagation times if using the relay network, (which most miners do even small ones) for all miners in aggregate?  thus, Peter's argument is irrelevant?
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:04:25
That's hardly a measure for potential change. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 14:32:44
if you want Bitcoin to become a digital form of gold, crippling it's use to 1MB won't achieve that.
the only way it can happen is if Bitcoin is given the chance to replace gold's usage by spreading far and wide so that all that behind the closed door activity you talk about with gold becomes useless.
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:06:50
@_date: 2015-07-16 03:42:34
1.  except that Blockstream is a much more direct and obvious conflict of interest in that they have a fiduciary duty to provide a return on that $21M in investment money while at the same time occupying 9 core dev slots overseeing a public good concerning what is supposed to be sound money.  despite them being open source, they stand to make lotsa money thru SC consulting and many ppl around here besides me think they are stalling the block size increase to give them time to push offchain tx's into LN or SC's.  i think the pessimism is warranted and predicted such conflict over a year ago here:  
as far as a potential for conflict with Gavin; MIT is a world renowned research institution and has an established solid reputation.  to accuse them and/or Brian Forde of bribing Gavin is pretty reckless imo and certainly won't take you far in the real world.
2.  having taken that definition from a legal website don't be surprised the named examples don't fit the Blockstream example exactly.  but i do think it applies quite aptly.
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:12:10


why?  you were still processing Core blocks as always.
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:01:50
I think the main goal of the spammer is to disrupt new user growth as in a bank or gvt. Yes, that's who I think is doing this right now and it makes sense given what is happening in the real world in terms of currency crisis and stock markets. They are fighting for their lives. By lifting the limit use disruption is short circuited as they can't jack the mempool while user growth explodes. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:05:05
the whole strategy ignores the ability of the hasher who created the block to notice the pool operator withholding his block and cry foul.
@_date: 2015-07-01 03:08:22
They could transact the spam to themselves along with the fees thus no cost. 
This is only possible because of the 1MB cap. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:05:53
i understand.  you should read this thread by there are several important principles in there.  
altho i would prefer no limit, i could get behind Gavin's proposal.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:43:41
and why would you think a miner would accept the bribe?  to destroy his own investment?  right.  his hashers would flee his pool in an instant and he'd lose any hardware he had investment in.  you guys don't understand the incentives in mining.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:51:33


thank you
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:19:45
Never, I'd guess. Not until they lift the limit. It's too cheap for them. Especially when they can just recycle the fees from deleted unconfirmed TX's. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:27:12
that's true.  spam inflicts a cost on full nodes that validate tx's immediately upon receipt and shoves those 0conf's into memory in wait of a block to clear them.  problem is right now they don't get cleared b/c the miners mempool gets cleared after 24 hr allowing the spammer to recycle his unpaid fees over and over again.  yes, this is an unfair stress on the network that can only be solved long term by forcing the spammer to actually pay those fees as his spam gets cleared into blocks.
w/o a block limit, the spammer walks a very dangerous path attempting to jack the mempool of miners to disrupt user growth.  he has no target limit.  given the performance of our miners and full nodes currently along with tech advances in the future in bandwidth, my bet is that spammers will get crushed as user growth is allowed to square the value of the network acc to Metcalfe's Law.  if price ramps, as it should, as user growth spreads worldwide you may be able to continue to afford that full node.  i plan on it.  
let the spammers fund the future mining network hashrate as they try to disrupt it.  i welcome them to try.  and if it's a problem, we soft fork back down to a limit.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:18:33
they have stock options
@_date: 2015-07-19 20:25:32
i think it's a great thing.  why?  b/c debasement can't be made in favor of a controlling/dominant printer and it's cronies.
@_date: 2015-08-07 15:26:21


no, they want blocks to stay small b/c they want to maintain their top 5 positions as the largest miners.  lifting the limit will put them at a competitive disadvantage to pools outside the GFC and they don't want that and are using ppl like you to enforce this advantage.


i have read that and i don't agree with it.  which is precisely why we've never seen this attack executed on a regular basis, or even once afaik.
i keep hearing all these concerns about mining attacks that never consider that miners have an almost infinite reason for Bitcoin to succeed the fundamental basis of which is the sound fixed money supply that it enforces.  screw with that soundness and you will be punished by every other actor in the system ala ghash.
@_date: 2015-08-21 00:04:22


yes i did.  in the very FIRST sentence of my endorsement thread.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:15:30
The way I see that timing is that they started working on LN when it became clear that SC's might not be supported. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:46:19
why?  this type of f2pool tx has to be specially constructed and self mined.  an ordinary spammer can't do this attack so it isn't an argument against bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-01 01:09:15
but the wiki says 15kB/min of free tx's?
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:28:23
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:53:25
What an inspiring story. You're living our strategy. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:17:29
They don't need to print it. They just need to attract millions worth of Bitcoin businesses to the region to spark all sorts of economic activity. Give them legal protection and I guarantee it will happen. Think of the job growth as a result. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:18:44
supposedly if what you say about Core and Gavin is correct.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:18:00
There's a difference. 
With a hard fork, one doesn't have to do anything to get their coins on the new chain. With a sidechain, you physically have to move them or risk being left behind. And if you're wrong, you're screwed. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:01:19
Yes it takes everyone 
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:54:18
yes, no limit.
let the miners constrain block sizes.  they have a variety of tools they can employ.  one is minfeerelaytx which they can move up to make more BTC and to constrain the size of their unconf tx set.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:30:06
The graphic is wrong. 
It should be one block per story. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:12:24
don't underestimate the desires of some Bitcoiner's to fork off the current core dev team.
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:31:15


nice contrast.  thank you.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:14:02
How could I? None of us have ever been here before. Yes, it's based on my own economic analysis of the free market and open source nature of the code and having been an early adopter. Doesn't mean I'm right but it also doesn't mean I'm wrong. Yes, I believe that if left to their own devices miners, users and full nodes will come to an economic and technical equilibrium that won't destroy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 03:41:06
also what the users use.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:18:24
Haha, so true
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:04:18
yeah, keep your head up.  thanks for this enlightening info on just how far they'll go.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:26:36
what they're reacting to is a direct result of the 1MB choke being consistently hit and unconf tx's increasing.
we actually need to increase the limit or take it off completely.
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:07:14
i know that.  doesn't matter b/c the miners perceive it to be large and are still acting defensively by mining SPV blocks.
i think it may be b/c the unconf tx set is ballooning as blocks get filled up and they don't want to include all that in the next block.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:29:22
wait, do both of the versions discussed above, XT 0.11A &amp; Core 0.11, exist on the XT repo that Mike controls?  what exactly will be in Core 0.11 again?


that's too simplistic of an analysis for 2 reasons:  first, the bigger blocks hasn't been implemented yet and second, there was no active price trading on an XT with those bigger blocks.  it therefore would be expected to see a drop in XT nodes b/c they don't include the desired attributes yet.
it most likely would be an entirely different story if they were implemented and the majority of the community took the time and effort to switch over to a fully loaded XT.  there would probably be no desire to go back to Core unless Mike or Gavin did something extremely eggregious (which they won't) or Core introduces a new tech that is SO superior to XT that one would *have* to go back.  both of which i think is unlikely.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:01:12
tremendous.  
@_date: 2015-07-25 15:45:57
Not because of a public key vulnerability but because of a faulty random number generator as in the Android case. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:10:37
i know you're not old enough to determine the difference.
it's irrelevant what they say.  it shouldn't have to be said that when a conflict of interest exists, you explicitly can't trust what they say.
and if you can't tell the difference btwn the financial remuneration that exists btwn being a salaried founder/employee for a public non profit institution like MIT versus a for profit salaried employee with plenty of stock options with $21M in high powered investment monies from heavy silicon valley hitters, then i can't help you.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:38:37
that doesn't make any sense b/c it was f2pool that custom made the tx and mined it.  any ordinary spammer can't do that.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:45:49
hahaha.  last time i posted in the Spinoff thread was July 25, 2014 since you refuse to acknowledge facts.
i must have a lot of interest in the concept, eh?!
but you have no right to hold me to anything at this pt in the debate.  maybe it IS something i might have to resurrect in my thinking if i continue to feel that BS and guys like you are abusing the community for your own ends.  frankly, i haven't even bothered to understand your twisted spinoff vs SC's/LN concept, but if i have to i will.
i know this FUD first came from gmax as he brought it up in my thread about a month ago.  had no idea it was stewing so badly in all your minds.
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:39:04
They are not colluding to create 1MB blocks. That limit has been forced on them by core dev. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:55:05
Me too because I think it will solve the issue of spam attacks once and for all and it will result in an active fee market between miners and users and NOT core dev. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:29:51


but that forces fees too high for the avg user.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:08:56
No Gavin would be lead 
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:37:02
we know; as a *temporary* ddos measure.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:19:33
Correct 
@_date: 2015-07-16 04:50:10
i'm not going to argue with you anymore.  your inability to see that a financial conflict of interest exists is pathetic.  
i'm sorry you're getting downvoted throughout this discussion.  it's not me.
@_date: 2015-07-01 01:29:43
this is part of the problem with 1MB limits.
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:54:27
that might be short circuited with an adequate block size increase.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:23:27
hey, i'm an early adopter and i vote:
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:28:07
I sure hope you're right but I would be much more comfortable if everyone on the planet was using it on a daily basis. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:37:42
i seriously doubt this.  smaller miners also access the relay network and most of the block tx's have already been pre-validate to there isn't any signif addit work required to accept it or relay it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:29:16
Why is that such a crazy idea? Some of us have talked about this for years. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:22:57
We see markets make counter intuitive moves all the time. It's the chart technicians primarily, who are watching the price action factor in a probable *solution* to the 1MB choke that's causing the rally. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:26:29
a couple of things.
those of us who have signif coin savings are likely to run larger full nodes when the need arises as larger requirements most likely translates to higher price thus offsetting the costs of a larger full node.  that would be a good problem to have.
second Satoshi envisioned specialized server full nodes early on.  i don't see a problem with that as long as we have enough scattered throughout various competing jurisdictions.:
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:18:15
My game theory says otherwise because you can't set orphan blocks aside. And there is no reason cartels would be more likely to form than they have now. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:51:02
How do you know it's not the miners themselves spamming the network to drive up fees? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:51:42


Yes. This is what he's missing. This is how TX's decrease in the long run. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:03:08
How is my thread "related to XT"? Just because we talk about it? 
Or is it because of me, an XT supporter? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:19:38
yes, it could be a bank and not nec. a gvt.
but you'd expect them to use a proportional attack that is just enough to disrupt the network and new user growth.  which is what we have now.  plus, the effectiveness of this attack has only recently just been realized in the last couple of weeks.  it is the first time this has ever happened.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:14:39
no, i'm referring to the normal full sized block with a complex non-std tx ala the f2pool 1MB block of a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:45:59
How are the keys different? 
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:57:39


correct.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:11:03
Mycelium should insist on bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:53:38
that is true. spammers are attacking precisely b/c they don't countries like Greece to adopt Bitcoin, imo.  the community does have to lift the block limit eventually to clear the spam.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:53:36
full nodes validate those tx's as soon as they arrive way before a block shows up. and they have to store them in memory.  what do you mean there is no cost?
@_date: 2015-07-01 13:11:05
I am merely pointing out a concept that is widely understood by experienced, mature people in the real world; "financial conflict of interest". What's inexplicable is that the core devs involved refuse to even acknowledge this or outright deny it. Instead, they invoke the trust model which should repulse most Bitcoiners, I would think. They are also using widespread character assassination and doxing. 
Yes, it appears I am putting myself in physical danger for pointing this out but sometimes principles are worth fighting for. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:40:44
please refrain from making ridiculous statements.
since the time of our great debates back on BCT, Bitcoin has crushed Ripple in terms of performance.  not to mention the fine.
and now you want to wreck Bitcoin too with your cockamamie theories of how the world works.

or, i can just pay him off.
@_date: 2015-07-23 07:01:04
was that his French exchange?
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:11:40
I'm not:  
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:48:03
sure it is.  a true fee mkt doesn't involve users having to *guess* what fee will get them through.  there is no effective seamless communication going on btwn miners and users.  have you not noticed all the complaints across the community from users who are stuck?
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:04:53
i totally understand that thinking. it would make sense if this current debate weren't so contentious.  do you really want to go thru all this again in the near future?  
altho Gavin's BIP101 may actually shoot too low, at least it has some built in growth rate for future proofing.  i see that he's trying to guestimate as close as possible so that we don't have to go thru this again.  that's a worthy goal if he can achieve that.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:43:26
oh, the other way that pools should regulate the size of their mempool w/o a cap is to adjust their minfee.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:12:03
i actually doubt that.  
the first 2 Stress Tests were announced and demonstrated signif clogging of the network.  no doubt there are state agents monitoring this thread.  given the recent worldwide financial turmoil, now is the precise time for them to try and disrupt a migration and adoption into Bitcoin from those countries in turmoil.  
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:31:46


and b/c they are, they will go broke over the long term?
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:10:00
so then why have a limit which is causing all the user disruption/delays we've been seeing recently if the economic actors involved can defend themselves?
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:16:41
it is possible that the market is perceiving choked growth from the block cap with the resultant lack of user growth:
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:27:09
@_date: 2015-07-23 12:06:39
Considering that Bitcoin continues to work after 6.5 years despite skeptics like you means the burden of proof lies on you for a claim like that. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:27:29
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:43:22


i agree.  that is the problem with caps in general.  as the blocks approach getting full, we can expect spam attacks to occur; at any level.  w/o a cap, a spam attack becomes infinitely risky financial-wise.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:06:47
no one asked you to spend money nor to make me look better.  that's just the delusion in your head.  
but of course, what's fair to you is to make me look bad and ignore my side of the story.  carry on. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:23:14
i'm assuming they get a salary.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:34:16
This would be pretty awesome if you ask me. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:42:04
i don't think you can accuse Gavin of that.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:11:40
but that's a red herring given that the exit nodes themselves are anonymous as you don't know who's IP is attacking *through* them.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:22:01
This is the thing about these devs. They don't understand human emotion. They think just because there's math involved along with some code, Bitcoin is simply a machine they can control along with the rest of us. 
A great example is the price, which is very much tied to Bitcoin's ultimate success. Any one with half an investment mind can tell you the price is driven mostly by sentiment aka emotion. Yes, there are fundamentals to a degree but we know that price often moves contrary to fundamentals and instead reflects sentiment. This is why we see volatility. If users get fed up with unconfirmed TX's or high fees, negative sentiment can surely set in and speculators of the price will react often violently to that negativity. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:19:30
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:26:27
correct.  
the only way for a single miner to produce larger blocks is if ALL the miners produce similarly larger blocks, otherwise the outlier gets orphaned.  if this happened, it would then only mean good things for Bitcoin as tx growth would be feeding all miners equally causing growth in the system and security overall.
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:38:32
any pool who locates deep in the mountains of Mongolia just to access hydro or the ice flats of Iceland are taking mining seriously for the long run.
@_date: 2015-07-23 02:04:00
there's alot of assumptions in there.  have you ever mined?  i have.
there's alot of infrastructure that needs to be built up and amortized over long periods of time.  pools don't do that for short term profits.  lotsa mines are located in extreme geographic locations for maximum power efficiency; again not a life style suited for a short term play.  no, these guys all are trying to make it long term and have evolved along the way.  it's a niche business and the good ones will last and become quite wealthy along the way. Bitfury is a great example.
@_date: 2015-07-02 04:33:36
this is why i propose eliminating the cap and giving the BS guys their soft fork for LN.
let's open the gates for both and let 'em run.  see which one wins out while letting each act as a relief valve for the other.
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:34:40
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:29:13


i think that's a concept that is way overblown.  it's easy to run Breadwallet on your phone.


of course things take time.  nothing can solve a problem as large as Greece overnight.  otoh, look how fast Bitcoin has grown in 6 yrs.  unbelievable.  Greeks should make the investment now in their own futures. 


like i said, provide services to the companies at first.  once Bitcoin starts percolating throughout the economy, synergies and chain links will build.  look at Brazil and Argentina.  they have thriving Bitcoin economies and they aren't nearly as stressed as you guys now.  where there's a will there's a way.


i don't think so.  Bitcoin is really designed for individuals who want to take personal responsibility for their money.

100,000 users isn't going to allow most ppl in the world to even *hear* about Bitcoin, let alone begin to think of it as a gold equivalent.  why do you even think gold has thousands of years of history to begin with?  it's b/c the common man in the villages could hold and transact with it back then.  they don't even do that anymore these days except re-bury it.  b/c Bitcoin is virtual and can't be appreciated for physical beauty, it needs to be used and transacted with to truly appreciate it's digital beauty.   do you remember the first time you started sending Bitcoin to yourself as a test?  remember how it suddenly clicked?  that's called *usage*.  the speed and liquidity of tx's is what makes ppl understand.  while i'm a firm believer that the fixed supply is most important, i realize that the liquidity of transactional use is what's going to make it take off.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:33:31
I agree, nothing fast. That's why I'd stick to Gavin's versioning over 6mo
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:35:14
don't we already have a 100kb tx size limit for std tx's?  the only way a 20MB non std tx can get mined is if it's self constructed AND mined as a non std tx.  it won't propagate across the network otherwise.

@_date: 2015-07-05 01:21:06


if i'm reading you right, i think there is more to it.
with 1MB, as blocks have been getting increasingly full from *real* demand, non-economic spammers identify an opportunity to disrupt the network.  their goal is to discourage new user growth by inc the  tx's.  it doesn't cost much b/c they only need to fill up a smallish % of the block which is already taken up by real demand.  we're seeing alot of this now outside the announced stress tests.  this disruption is only possible *because* we have a limit.  it acts like a target for the spammers that gives a known result; disruption.  w/o a limit, that target disappears and removes the  other target of the spam, the user, b/c he has cheap, reliable tx fees.  and it's the user that will result in squaring of the network according to Metcalfe's Law.
we then see all sorts of deviant behavior occur as a result of hitting the limit, like this SPV mining debacle.  users having to play games by guessing higher fees to not get stuck.  proposals like RBF coming to the fore.
this is all a result of the 1MB choke that's been getting consistently hit for weeks now.
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:44:44
One you understand that the spammer is trying to disrupt new and existing users, you realize that no limit blocks eliminates the ability to disrupt those users. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:15:25
Why would you assume tx rate would stay the same? Bitcoin is as much about sentiment as it is math. Do you not think there could be such a thing as frustration with unconfirmed TX's? 
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:36:07
That by itself is a huge plus. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:24:18
btw, you should look at this.  this is proof i had a problem with Blockstream and their financial conflict of interest over a year ago:
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:48:09
someone has to adapt.  right now, priority  is to unclog the mempool by removing the block cap.  i doubt blocks will exceed 2.5MB from organic growth immediately once the spammers get killed off.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:08:14
that's ok if that's what they decide now.  but in the long run, they need blocksizes much larger to handle all the tx's plus process all the tx fees as a replacement for their current block rewards.

@_date: 2015-08-04 07:54:34
That is a myopic assessment. The miner would also factor in the costs of damaged reputation, loss of hardware investment, potential destruction of the price, and potential undermining of the entire mining concept. ,

@_date: 2015-07-07 08:18:21
We should remove the block limit entirely and let the miners adjust the minfee setting to keep the unconfirmed TX set to a reasonable size.

yes, unconf tx's get deleted after 24-48 hr but clog up the honest users in the meantime.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:04:37
that's fine.
but when it is, do you agree that Bitcoin could hold promise?
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:14:47
China *wants* Gavin's proposal. They merely expressed a preference for it to be implemented within Core so as not to cause controversy. Don't expect them to keep 1MB just to stay on Core. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:22:53
As an experienced user myself, even I have sometimes reduced the minimum fee to 0 hoping it will go through to save money. The average user will just as often take this route. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:12:25
the obvious problem is the widespread congestion we're seeing b/c of the block limit.  full blocks plus 51K worth of unconf tx's prevent new and existing users to transact unless they knowing add a higher fee.  however, this new level of attack spam has increased the fees to .0002 to pre-empt yesterdays user fee inc.  tomorrow, it'll probably go to .0003.  how long can the network remain congested w/o a crash?  the limit needs to be lifted.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:11:32

@_date: 2015-07-16 23:19:54
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:38:12
another dynamic that's been dismissed, much to my chagrin, is that in the absence of a limit, as block sizes grow from inc user growth, merchants will also grow to meet user demand to transact.  what's the first thing most merchants should do to ensure tx security?  set up a full node.  they will have the size and probable fiduciary responsibility to add a full node. so if anything, as block sizes increase, full node security should actually increase.

Lol, the down vote king. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:48:49
the point is that miners have control of what size blocks they *must* construct to determine maximum profitability.  only they know what this is based on their own proprietary internal data analyses of which only they have access to, not core dev, and which takes into account the fees which users are willing to pay.
in other words block size bloat can never be allowed in the absence of a limit if miners want to stay in business.  they will do what it takes to defend against such an attack.
@_date: 2015-07-26 18:40:12

@_date: 2015-07-25 23:54:50
more significantly, i doubt the concept works with 1MB blocks b/c of the volatile fees.

since you seem so interested in the spinoff thread to actually count posts, tell me the last time i posted there.  probably not for over a year which should tell you i don't have a lot of interest in the concept right now. but no, you'd rather take an absolute  twist and inject your own form of delusion into it as some sort of evidence that i'm being disingenuous about my concerns with Blockstreams financial conflict of interest.  that's what ppl do when they don't want to face the truth; they dissemble, obfuscate, and resort to character assasination which is exactly what you're doing.

a sidechain that outperforms Bitcoin's mainchain would be disastrous for all of us.

yes, this ignores the ability of a pool's hashers to punish the owner.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:46:47
depends on your philosophy.  there's a small section of a block dedicated to free tx's.  iirc, it's weirdly defined like 15 kB/min or such.  but i hear most miners have deleted it.  it's meant for very old UTXO's and large amts that might be given "priority" for what it's worth.
@_date: 2015-07-23 01:52:54
here's an interesting metric:  gmax's trust rating acct on BCT.
look how filled it is with back and forth + &amp; - ratings.  why does he care so much when he should be coding?  now look at all the other core dev's trust rating accts; they're empty from disuse.  they don't care.
now look at his negative rating of me.  do you see any hypocrisy or even worse?

conflict of interest
n. a situation in which a person has a duty to more than one person or organization, but cannot do justice to the actual or **potentially** adverse interests of both parties. This includes when an individual's personal interests or concerns are inconsistent with the best for a customer, or when a public official's personal interests are contrary to his/her loyalty to public business. **An attorney, an accountant, a business adviser or realtor cannot represent two parties in a dispute and must avoid even the appearance of conflict.** He/she may not join with a client in business without making full disclosure of his/her potential conflicts, he/she must avoid commingling funds with the client, and never, never take a position adverse to the customer.

@_date: 2015-07-23 06:48:58
i am in a dispute with Hashfast so i can't talk too many details but in this country, one is normally considered innocent until proven guilty and i deny all their allegations and expect to prevail.  i've never dealt directly with him in any financial tx yet he's issued a negative rating acting like i have which he will willingly remove contingent on me giving him money i rightfully earned and isn't his.  which is ridiculous as negative ratings aren't supposed to be contingent on a payoff.  esp from someone who always brags about only acting on behalf of the community which he isn't in this case as there are other individuals in his same boat.
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:11:53
Except that AnonyCoinSideChain can be centrally controlled by any rules its creator decides. They can exist independently of the scBTC. Sounds like inflation backed by Bitcoin. Have you EVER heard of any limitations to speculative SC assets talked about by is creators? I haven't. 
How about merge mining 51% attacks? How about direct mining of the SC leeched away from the MC? How about the real lost tx fees from migrated scBTC that would have transacted on the MC? It won't all be new business. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:22:45
current XT is backwards compatible with Core.  it just doesn't allow bigger blocks as of yet.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:39:52

@_date: 2015-07-19 22:37:26
but the likelihood that ppl will cash in Bitcoin to go back to fiat is much less than the reverse as the value of their Bitcoin is more likely to sustain itself over time.
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:14:58


otoh, no cap will allow mining to spread outside China to even out the favorable advantage Chinese miners now enjoy with the 1MB cap, cheap labor, cheap electricity, and probably favorable regulation.
as for mining 0 tx blocks routinely, i'd think this would come at some risk as hashers will make more income by pointing at pools that do mine fees and have faster connections.
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:01:06

@_date: 2015-07-25 16:31:23
Blockstream has a very well defined philosophy:  they don't think Bitcoin scales.  thus, they don't support bigger blocks and are developing solutions that just happen to involve consulting fees for SC's.  gmax is particularly bearish on Bitcoin as he's argued that centralization is occurring on the mining front and with full nodes despite plenty of evidence to the contrary.  


that's not when the concern happened.  it started a year ago:
@_date: 2015-07-05 06:45:15
right, which is why i think there should be no limit.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:26:22
also, the title
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:32:35
in a more practical sense, w/o a block cap to shoot for, spammers walk a fuzzy, unknown path towards attempting to bloat the mempool.  afterall, disrupting new and existing user is their main goal to preventing growth of Bitcoin as it is the user who will square the value of the network acc to Metcalfe's Law.  spammers can try to perform an attack but it's quite likely the network just absorbs the spam while inflicting massive losses on the attacker.  while a defined cap gives a known result of mempool bloat for little cost as most of the block has already been taken up from real users trying to get tx's thru.
@_date: 2015-07-03 17:59:40
Amazing. Way to go Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:40:41
Instead of just drooling all over yourself, explain to everyone here why a large for profit corporation would pay Blockstream huge consulting fees to construct an innovative SC yet not want to protect that investment through an airtight non compete clause or maybe through even a patent? 
Or perhaps you would have us believe that, just like the Blockstream investors, they only want Bitcoin to succeed as opposed to subverting it in this very way? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:30:13
if anything, Gavin's timing was prescient as we soon got all the stress test attacks soon thereafter.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:45:17
well then, let them incl as many tx's as they want.  but then they run the risk of orphaning vs other miners constructing smaller more efficiently propagated blocks.  we've already seen most miners eliminate the 50kB or so of free tx space in their blocks.  no miner can just go out their willy nilly spamming large blocks.  it will cost them dearly.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:38:35
thanks for that explanation.  much clearer now.


when XT is released, you can bet there will be separate prices on exchanges for both BTC on XT vs Core.  if we get the migration to XT we all expect, any sunken monies into XT will be much less likely to move back to Core for anything less than an extreme circumstance.
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:23:29


don't you mean "succeeding" blocks?
unless you mean preceding blocks to the tx itself?

Are you a dev? 
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:15:12


there's no evidence of dangerous centralization in mining:  
but i will say that the 1MB cap favors inferiorly connected Chinese miners at the expense of mining that could be taking place and further decentralizing mining outside of China.
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:09:51


How so? Many people have invested more than miners directly in the coin itself. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:04:09

@_date: 2015-07-22 19:47:43
cool.  
just to review, the key difference btwn this and Trezor is the secure chip element as otherwise the code is a Trezor fork?
@_date: 2015-07-22 13:57:48
It's very likely they're doing the same thing 
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:05:40
That was Cyprus  
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:39:09
sure, long term, as block rewards drop they will compensate by including more and more tx's and building bigger blocks.  this is why there should be no limit so this transition process can be allowed to occur.
meanwhile, bandwidth will increase over time.
@_date: 2015-07-02 02:27:09
Links? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:46:36


how do you know this?  if billions of tx's are being performed on mainchain, the total fees per block could be quite significant for the miner but on a per tx basis for the user quite low.  not saying i know, but why are you so sure?
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:48:55
there will be more money to be made by miners mining the mainchain which facilitates their transition from block rewards to tx fees and ensures their long term survival.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:14:04
But I've heard other devs can add things. Also gmax supposedly controls the BIP numbering? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:17:00


ok, we have a misunderstanding.  i meant that minfeetxrelay can be used by miners themselves to screen tx's.  f2pool has been doing just that recently.  plus, anyone sending tx directly to a miner is doing something exceptional in the network.
i also think even small mining pools have connected to the relay network at this point.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:07:42
Are we saying the same thing? If XT gets rapidly adopted, like I think it will, and most move to it, then by all means the likelihood of migration back to Core is nil. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 05:05:34

@_date: 2015-07-30 19:20:07
how do you know growth hasn't been stunted to 400kB b/c of all the problems we just had with the recent full block/bloated mempool congestion?
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:46:44
In the short term, those z bitcoin businesses have plenty of money to import their basic needs like food, etc. In no time at all you'd see Greeks wanting to provide services to those wealthy companies. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:05:23
It's also possible there is no cliff without a limit. For most of Bitcoins history we've never seen spam attacks. Only now, when we're bumping up against the limit from real tx growth. The network has handled it quite well. Perhaps the only reason we have congestion is because of the cap? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:57:09


this is called volatility or, in it's worst terms, unpredictability.  something we don't want in our money.


and it is not necessary when miners are reaping 25 BTC rewards
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:36:09


the continuous stream of on time full blocks.  miners don't appear to be having any problem digesting OR transmitting them.  nor are there any problems with full nodes.  my half dozen or so are cranking along just fine.  in a metaphorical sense, i see miners "begging" to process bigger blocks to eat up the fees clogged in their mempools.  my bet is that they'd chew thru it pretty fast.  the network has already paid half the cost in processing the spam via the full nodes.  let bigger blocks propagate so that we can all clear our mempools.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:22:30
btw, even if we lifted the cap altogether and for some reason my theories are wrong and the spammer is somehow able to destabilize the network, well, we can just step back in and create a soft fork to reinstitute a limit.
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:43:00

@_date: 2015-07-22 13:49:01

yes, but does it have a block size increase?  no.
@_date: 2015-08-08 13:24:13


Haha, what a way to put it. 
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:39:04


there's a subtlety here though that can be very dangerous to Bitcoin itself.  imo, they are trying to morph Bitcoin into their vision which differs greatly from Satoshi's that being a reliance on offchain solutions for the majority of tx's.  to me, this doesn't make alot of sense as those tx fees are needed on the mainchain to pay miners as they transition out from block rewards.  plus, SC's are less secure than mainchain which can cause problems.
@_date: 2015-08-07 12:56:06
So why haven't we seen this on a regular basis over the last 6y? And why would someone buy all that equipment just to piss that value away? 
Btw, Gavin is working on a fix for this so if may be moot. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:27:03
maybe b/c we just lost a boatload of potential new users during the last spam attack?  yeah, i know that *could* be a little over the top but you can't say i'm wrong either.

You can't say this. 
If bitcoin grows a thousand times from uncapping blocks, that will drive the price up at least a thousand times and the cost of running a node would be proportional to today.

We've seen plenty of evidence that miners primary goal these days is to collect the block reward. 0 tx blocks being the most obvious during the spam attacks. There is a clear limit to including fees that miners are willing to bear.

hashes are much shorter than public keys
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:38:02
we're never going to know unless we try to push the limits of the networks ability.  i'd argue that the blockchain should hold as many of the tx's as possible to maximize fees for miners in the long run.  and here's the thing, we can always soft fork back to a limit if we have to.  but i don't think it will be necessary as the miners will self regulate the size of their blocks and *cannot* allow block bloat for their own survival.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:52:01

@_date: 2015-07-17 05:10:37


it has everything to do with it.  in a hard fork, those of us with cold wallets don't have to go digging them out to transfer over to a SC that is threatening to destroy the MC (mainchain).  we simply have to wait for which fork wins.  and we don't even need to download the upgraded software until or unless we want to make a tx.




yeah, we don't have time to wait for SC's or LN.  we need scaling now in the form of bigger blocks with a hard fork


that's why we have altcoins if you're merely going thru exchanges.  if you want to attempt decentralization, go with federated servers.  i'm fine with that.


at least with a hard fork, you know a big change is coming and you know not to engage in tx's during the transition if you want to avoid be double spent.  with SC's, you will never know which of the thousands of SC's out there will become dominant and could threaten the MC.  i don't want to live in a money system where i'm constantly having to look over my shoulder for the next SC i might have to forcibly and quickly migrate over to.

@_date: 2015-07-08 01:50:22
you need to listen to what just said.  it's actually costing almost *nothing* for the spammers to plug up the network and disrupt usage as unconf tx's get deleted after 24-48h after having done their damage allowing the attacker to start all over.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:09:58
the other question is, should we be panicking now?  what about all this congestion in mempools and all these ppl complaining about stuck tx's?  that's undeniable.  should we be dumping BTC now since it doesn't seem at all apparent that core dev is going to resolve this?  what about this huge rise in LTC?  maybe the market is telling us it likes Litecoin better and foreses it winning in the long run over Bitcoin?  all b/c we have some ppl wedded to 1MB?
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:33:25


of course he must upgrade his software.  but that's much easier than actually having to transmit them to a sidechain.


misleading.  with a hard fork, you have coins on both chains and you merely have to wait and see which one fails w/o losing your coins since they exist on both simultaneously.  with a SC, it's either or for your coins.  if you happen to have your coins on the the SC or MC when one of them fails, you're screwed.  and as i said above, you actively have to move them back and forth which involves risk.

well, we just aren't seeing that happen are we? ever since the ghash incident we have seen a steady mining state equilibrium with Discus not exceeding 22%:    while ghash was destroyed to 2% for misbehaving.  we also found out that the "large miner with superior connectivity attack on small miners" is really armchair FUD spread around by pwuille.  the Chinese miners told us flat out that their connectivity is *inferior* making them impotent to perform that attack.  in fact, i'd argue this 1MB cap has been the best thing for them as it has acted as a subsidy to their dominance by allowing them to leverage their cheap labor, cheap power, cheap resources, while subsidizing their bandwidth liability.

In that same link of yours, someone clarifies that most miners reject 0 fee TX's and full nodes refuse to relay them. Minimum tx fee is 0.00001.
As for the large miner attack: the 5 largest miners in the world just admitted to us that they have inferior connectivity from behind the GFC.  Any attempt to launch a large block attack would be immediately orphaned. That theory is bunk. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 00:42:53


well, i ask that after last nights accident where those 2 pools lost 6 block rewards or 150BTC from the orphaning, and many ppl had tx's reversed with probable losses, along with losses from wallet providers, how much more damage do you need to take action?

let's go back to the no limit scenario since that is what i'm actually arguing for.  look at this current attack; it was launched after we had gotten real demand for block space up to around 50-60% of 1MB.  this tells me they either just figured out how to do this attack (after 6 yrs) OR they will wait until blocks get nearly full to launch the attack so as to minimize their costs.  IOW, they use the cap as a target which guarantees that they will be able to jack the mempool.  w/o a cap, all of a sudden there is no cap or target when to launch the attack.  it will be a dark, fuzzy walk for them to attempt to bloat the mempool.  and *they* will be the one filling the vast majority of whatever block size gets chosen by the miner, unlike now.  remember, i believe this is there main objective; disrupt new and existing users by bloating the mempool.  all of a sudden that gets very hard if not impossible.  as well, as i said before, we've learned that our miners and full nodes have handled the current attack very well.  if the spammer decides to walk this fuzzy attack path upwards, he stands to lose alot of BTC if the network can indeed absorb his spam. remember, the spam will no longer be returned to him via cancelled unconf tx's after 24 h.  they will be cleared by the miner in this no limit scenario and he will be forced to take those losses unlike now.
furthermore, the bottom line is that the miner is free to choose whatever block size he wants. if he decides to ignore the spam to instead construct small, efficient blocks, there's nothing the spammer can do to force him to create bloated blocks.  the miner can also defend his mempool with minfee.  however, if the miner decides to go for large blocks to capture the fees, he's free to do that as well.  but he won't go crazy b/c he runs the risk of orphans if he gets ahead of other miner's avg block size.  this keeps him in relative sync with them.  he also runs his own full node so he can monitor it's capacity which is reflective of everyone else's full node stress.  remember, he has an incentive NOT to disrupt the network as it is in his best interest.

that's a ridiculous assumption on your part.  no one invests that much money and effort thinking short term.  the incentive structure built up around a sound money system are such that if Bitcoin survives out to 10y, those miners will go with it and make a fortune.  and btw, we are already out to 6y and going strong.  miners in China i've heard are making over $30000 per day and that is plenty to be upgrading hardware all along the way out.  THAT is why we've seen such a proliferation of mining pools in the charts.  these are in NO WAY short term plays.

@_date: 2015-07-22 17:07:34
that's an odd argument.  
it wasn't working precisely b/c of the 1MB cap causing all sorts of deviant behavior by miners such as the 0 tx blocks and the single 1MB tx by f2pool.  what i find most interesting is that towards the end of the attack almost all the miners were producing full blocks as they and full nodes figured out that the network was quite capable of handling the load by producing blocks right on time despite the overloaded mempool.  if we in fact had bigger blocks, i'd bet they'd have chewed right thru that mempool with the greatest of ease thus locking in the spam fee losses of the attacker.

You're using gold as a reference. Because it's physical and beautiful (along with limited supply), it has been used for ages as a transactional currency and SOV. Anyone in the world can access it easily. 
Because Bitcoin has neither of those physical properties, it has a higher bar to clear to replace gold. That being the beauty of its transactional properties. Until or unless everyone in the world can experience these amazing attributes of Bitcoin, it will always have to compete with gold. That's restrictive and certainly unnecessary. We should want and allow gold bugs to drop gold for bitcoin. That means easy and affordable access.

No, they will limit the size of the block because their emphasis is the block reward and the bigger the block gets the higher the orphan rate. They may try to walk the fees up until they start getting orphaned at a higher rate than before but then they'll back off as they have ultimate control of block size and mempool (with minfee) not the spammer.

i've been watching all these full blocks and the occasional 0 tx block come thru for the last few weeks.  it's my impression that these 0 tx blks happen when the unconf tx set gets high from blocks getting full, like on the order of 11-12K or more.  i would guess that the miners normally try to swallow most of the unconf tx's into a block.  however, as this set has spiked in size, they probably don't want to process that many for fear of a subsequent orphan.  so they've probably just made the decision to SPV in these situations which is becoming *much* more common nowadays.

just wanted to remind you of this convo we had over a year ago. just to emphasize my opinions were never just isolated to the block size debate.
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:25:57
it's pretty clear to me with this never ending stream of full blocks that miners are *begging* for bigger blocks in a metaphorical kinda way.  if blocks sizes were eliminated, they'd chew up that mempool in an instant thus unlocking user growth.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:20:27


this can also be called decentralization leading to greater security.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:38:19
but i thought your main concern for choking blocks at 1MB was b/c of full node centralization that would start shutting down from over capacity?  my survey of all my nodes show minimal utilization with large excess capacity during this full block phase which is becoming increasingly frequent.
whether 1MB blocks are actually large or just full really doesn't matter.  the miner's perception is that they are large compounded by the fact that the unconf tx set is increasing, therefore, they are forming SPV blocks as a defensive maneuver.  they've told us this.  i think the miners are looking at unconf tx sets of 11-12K and saying "screw it", we're just going to mine an SPV instead of swallowing all those into a block that runs the risk of orphaning.
thus, all this aberrant behavior along with clear financial losses from block reward reversals and user/merchant tx reversals is causing problems, all as a result of the 1MB choke.

In the distribution phase of Bitcoin, when miners are making a luxurious 25 BTC block reward, there's no need for expensive fee; after all they're trivial in comparison. What's more important are inexpensive fees that allow the user base to grow according to Metcalfe. Long term, as rewards drop, miners will be forced to filter for profitable TX's that allow themselves a reasonable profit. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:03:30

@_date: 2015-07-09 04:31:09


and the proof of this is that full blocks are being created right on time (doubtful before this incident) and full nodes are functioning just fine w/o crashing (we were told they would crash and centralize).
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:21:43
Does this have anything to do with all the full blocks and bloated unconfirmed TX's? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:56:09
first off, only a miner can construct such a large tx &gt;100kB as it is non std otherwise it won't propagate thru the network.  that same miner then has to mine it to push the block out onto the network.  you'd have to implicate the large miners like f2pool as trying to harm the network which makes no sense on it's face.  i don't get your concern over larger blocks like 8MB or 20MB in this context.
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:17:34
the devs seem to worry most about full node centralization as a result of increasing the block size.  otoh, that will increase user growth worldwide which is just as important in decentralizing Bitcoin.  they move inversely.

@_date: 2015-07-08 19:40:57
Sure as long as it is under 100kb. But then you no longer get 1 tx per block. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:43:04
you don't understand the legal system.
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:08:23
Even if 4MB was correct, and I'm not saying it is, that would be applicable to today, but not tomorrow metaphorically speaking. Also, the only tests I'm aware of are those from done from China w/o connections to full nodes outside the GFW or other adaptive strategies which Chinese miners have already said they have started to implement. 
As well, don't forget we're talking limits here, not immediate block sizes.

@_date: 2015-07-22 16:09:04
you bring up some good pts.
one thing i'd like to see in a manifesto is a general principle towards "hands off" the code unless there is a major threat to Bitcoin on the horizon.  one thing that goes unappreciated and even promoted as a criticism against Gavin is his relatively hands off approach over the 5 yrs or so of his position as lead core dev.  i always got the sense that he was quite satisfied for the most part with Bitcoin (why shouldn't he be?) while the other BS core devs were always frantically looking for ways for themselves to plug huge FUD holes in Bitcoin from supposed *centralization* or even for personal gain.  i always thought that Gavin just put up with them and let them tinker around the edges w/o causing too much damage.  little did he know a coup was slowly building behind the scenes.
if XT or some other fork can give us enough room to grow w/o anymore hard forks, there's a good chance that could be **it** for any further changes needed to the code.  so in that sense, a statement from the XT core devs that no changes will be made except in extraordinary circumstances might help.
@_date: 2015-07-24 02:41:05
you mean, renege on the reality of the last 6 years.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:04:07
there's no way pools are making location decisions based on how close they are to other pools.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:34:02
So would a block size increase 
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:07:30
that's the pt.  spammer can just keep inc fees to cause congestion while getting refunded as their spam gets deleted from mempool.  rinse repeat.
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:22:43
another bug.  when i delete an account, it actually doesn't get deleted.  it sticks around somewhere in memory so that when i click the Ledger button to try and restore that same deleted acct with the backup, done as a test, it automatically picks it up from somewhere in memory and displays it as an account to import.
btw, i got it to work with 8 digit pin.  still kinda untuitive and i probably got lucky.  you need to distinguish more clearly earlier on in the process a choice btwn importing an acct and creating a new acct.

No. Those blocks would get orphaned. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:20:28


that's certainly one strategy.  the other would be to increase minfeetxrelay to constrain their unconf tx set and form efficient sized blocks.

I think there's a major difference between any other open source model you can find and Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is money. And more importantly Sound Money (as in fixed supply). Many of us are involved in the deep philosophical meaning of what this means for individuals as it provides the world a way out of the fiat debt trap that it finds itself in. Just look at the financial turmoil going on around us recently. Bitcoin, in contrast, has been a sea of tranquility. I believe it can change the world. 
In that sense, Bitcoin is a public good that can't even begin to be accused of having a controlling self interested for profit company in charge. It doesn't matter that they haven't yet done anything bad (although I'm sure some of us consider this block size obstruction an example). All there has to be is a potential for a conflict of interest. 
Imo, they should step down from their core dev committer positions or reorg to a non profit.

@_date: 2015-07-01 00:20:20
the problem is that there are SO many different wallet implementations out there and none of them seem to be upgrading to handling changing fees.  part of the reason for that is that exactly what to do is so contentious and fuzzy in terms of how to scale.  none of them want to spend any time reworking code until more clarity is found which doesn't seem too soon in coming.
meanwhile we keep bumping up against the limit and clogging the network.  we can't even tell if this is spam or increasing adoption from bank runs.  we definitely have evidence of the latter and exchanges are reporting 10x volume.
and here we have gmax advocating a "last minute" limit increase if we need one?  how the heck are wallet providers supposed to deal with that kind of guidance?  
no, the best, simplest, and most understandable way to deal with this is to inc the block size and soon.

Bitcoin can't solve everyone's problems overnight. More printing certainly won't either.

Localbitcoins and the new Greek exchange can provide liquidity.

i'll answer that.  and i'm not a CS.  
Bitcoin is different in that we're dealing with money.  the lesson from this rabid debate is that we don't have many, if any, chances left to hard fork.  Gavin imo is trying to code in an update schedule that makes any future hard forks unnecessary thus avoiding any further divisiveness.  he already has declined to be lead core dev of XT we learned today.  evidence that he doesn't want to be the **benevolent dictator** that all of the Cripplecoiners have been accusing him of being.

 this has got to be embarrassing for Adam Back.
I just started reading the Princeton Bitcoin book and listen to this from page 14:
*Bitcoin uses essentially the same 
computational puzzle as Hashcash, but 
with some minor improvements. Bitcoin does a lot more than Hashcash does, though — after all, it takes a whole book to explain Bitcoin! 
I only mention this because Hashcash 
inventor Adam Back has said, “Bitcoin is Hashcash extended with inflation
control.” I think that’s overreaching a bit. It’s sort of like saying, “a Tesla is just a battery on wheels.”*

ok, i get it.  once you generate the pub key from the 256 priv key, you destroy the priv key until you need to regenerate it from the pw using Hashcalc.  but still, this method depends on how secure your pw is and could be prone to a dictionary attack.

@_date: 2015-04-16 16:46:00
i agree with your contentions on importing, but that is not what we were talking about.  jratcliff was wanting *sweeping* which is just a spend-like tx from the BIP38 paper wallet into one of the HD wallets existing addresses.  trasla quite rightly pointed that out as justification for why Mycelium's only option is the spend function which allows more of a conscious decision to leave funds behind in a BIP38 public key that has now become exposed.  that's a slightly less secure and anonymous way to do it but not bad at all as the likelihood of being able to brute force an identifiable newly exposed public key is nil.  there is a significantly higher risk of deanonymization however.
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:41:40
Who's kidding? If Bitcoin is perceived to be able to provide that level of service to the markets and displace entities like the DTC, do you have any idea how much value that will create in Bitcoin? Obviously not. Plus, all those valid TX's are all going to pay regular fees that will help grow and further decentralize and secure mining and the entire industry.

surely you can see the lack of preparation in that argument?  you want to restrict Bitcoin now but when the time comes to accept a huge influx of money-in-flight, somehow Bitcoin can accept that influx?  more likely, it just breaks from the mempool overload and crashing full nodes OR the flight heads into an altcoin that is prepared to accept it.  btw, i maintain that Bitcoin missed a great opportunity over the summer to capitalize on a significant amount of capital flight as the stock mkts peaked and rolled worldwide.  the entire Chinese stock futures mkt has vaporized to the tune of 99%.  THAT is extraordinary and yet Bitcoin was unable and unwilling to accept any of the exiting capital from that debacle.


if we were to see such a radical change in the recordation of such traditional products of Wall St amounting in the $trillions, how can you not see investors/speculators concluding that, at the very least, they should put a few fractions of a % of their monies into the foundational BTC units of such a new, immutable system?  after all, these institutions need those units to embed data.  sure, you call it minimal but i call it substantial.  there are again $trillions of these types of products on Wall St.  what we're talking about here is Big Time fundamental change.  to think that *none* of the speculative monies go into the BTC unit and not take it much higher is naive.  i've said for years that the nerd mind fails to understand the Speculative Mind of the market that exists out there today.  there are precious few valid investment opportunities out there today that match that of a fixed supply new digital money that has the potential to tap the mountains of fresh speculative printed monies that the Forex mkt represents.  
in fact, the exchange price HAS to rise to accommodate all that transactional volume we're talking about.

I seriously doubt that. That's because of the relative concentration of mining in China. We should want mining to decentralized to more countries. To do that would mean increasing hashrate. By decreasing hashrate you would only allow Chinese miners to further leverage their free electricity, low manufacturing costs, and cheap labor.

@_date: 2015-09-13 13:05:13
Your missing the point. 
The whole argument is only about miners, large and small. Cripplecoiners claim large miners can attack small miners and progressively gain an advantage because of superior connectivity to other large miners. Not that they would even do this to begin with givem Governing Dynamics, but. For the sake of argument, let's say they try. It won't work for 2 reasons, Peter_R's paper shows that there is a free market fee equilibrium that will set up that forces orphaning and economic loss AND the fact that small miners can access the open relay network to eliminate latency just like large miners. 
Cripplecoiners are trapped in their inconsistency because they try to criticize Peter_R's paper by screaming there is no latency because of the relay network and therfore no fee market equilibrium. 
Well, which is it? 
@_date: 2015-09-20 14:44:37
The value add to Bitcoin will be enormous and displace traditional clearing and storage houses like the DTC. That will drive the price like crazy causing speculators to bet on the coin.

@_date: 2015-09-14 02:29:39
all i'm saying is that in the example i've given there are many other variables that should enter his analysis.  namely, bigger blocks resulting in more users, more tx's, a higher price, inc hashrate as mining grows to meet that demand, just to mention a few all of which should result in *increased security*.  to simply say that increasing A leads to decreasing B is too simplistic.  he doesn't even mention these factors.

you must be confused.  all the fears of a no limit or large limit situation revolve around an "attacking large miner" constructing large blocks to disadvantage small miners.
one of the most commonly discussed attacks is a large miner self constructing a multi-input large block ala f2pool's single 1MB tx block of a month ago.  this block took 25 sec to validate, much longer than avg.  some ppl FUD about this attack being used if there were no limit.  
so what are you objecting about?

That's the amazing part of this from someone like myself who's been around and involved in the community longer than gmax as well. 
He's always inexplicably been a Bitcoin Bear which I always thought odd of a core dev until he admitted how he had publicly dismissed Bitcoin early on. Then it made sense and put into clear perspective his authoritarian behavior around the forum and IRC. 
and his subsequent behavior and endeavor with Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:31:17

Nope. You're just projecting your own deficiencies. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 15:53:11
how do you know it doesn't work?  they seem to think it might, so why not let them try?  they're more than willing to pay the fees that *you* have determined to be reasonable yet now you want to pick and choose who gets to pay those fees to transact?  that sounds like a command and control system.

But this really is the point isn't it?
From my perspective, some of the core devs have badly misjudged the communitys support for growth and bigger blocks. They seem to live in their own little worlds where they think they can play with and manipulate a billion dollar industry. 
That's really not the case and I have no doubt this has been a shock to them. To save face, and perhaps because some COI, they have now become entrenched.

those would be real world uses.  we should be so lucky they're considering it.  the value of the coins required would be jacked and so would the fees they would be required to pay which would act as a regulator for it getting out of control.  meanwhile, our holdings will skyrocket in value from such huge usage.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:02:33
LN can only be run by centralized big players.  that's b/c BTC needs to be committed to the hub upfront for the channels to work properly from an economic standpoint.  so no, there won't be millions of LN hubs.
plus, what LN hubs are trying to do is replace the POW real world cost function (electricity and hardware) which is fundamental to Bitcoin's security model and success.  LN is just another attempt at a POS software as a security model that won't stand up to market pressures and scrutiny.

read about it in 2009. i remember exactly where i was; on my couch at night lying East-West.  thought it was interesting but it wasn't worth anything!  basically ignored it.
in Jan 2011, looked back at the chart from Oct 2010 and saw a massive price ramp from about $0.20 to $1.50 with it then sitting at a measly $0.60 or so.  i said, "hmmm, there's something here!"  didn't sleep for the next 2 mo.
and here we are.
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:22:56

miners are doing it now.  look at all the occasional 1 tx blocks we get when the spam comes.  it has served as an effective deterrent to the current attacks.

So if miners can mitigate a spam attack this effectively, why do we need a limit again? 
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:13:23
which goes back to my pt about LN hubs taking precious fees away from miners.  not good.  plus, it will probably be BS running most of the hubs b/c they take substantial BTC upfront to secure the channels.  that's centralized and vulnerable.

ultimately he's going to have to choose sides.  b/c what drives Bitcoin is support from the ppl, ie, the masses.  that's what sound money will do to ppl.  IBM is a big corporation who some might argue has benefited from gvt largesse, cheap inflationary money.  to exist as big as they are, they have no choice but to seek legitimacy from the very partners who enabled them.  the solution, afaic, is for USG and banking to go with the movement towards Bitcoin.  i think there is a basis for a relatively smooth transition. they have to do this b/c there are other gvts worldwide who will adopt Bitcoin.  we're already seeing considerable interest in exploring this.  any gvt that resists this runs the risk of being obsoleted.  sounds dramatic but i think that is what is happening before our very eyes.
@_date: 2015-09-04 03:45:15
yep, as in i agree with the suggestion.  
you're right, could've made that clearer.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:22:33
But the relay network is accessible to all miners large or small. 
Small blockists are now forced to make a choice between their FUD; large miner block attacks enabled by latency or non latency transmission between large miners facilitated by an open relay network?

@_date: 2015-09-20 15:20:14
at first i downvoted you b/c i read too fast.  then after re-reading i upvoted you.  i think the most promising use for Bitcoin is as a SOV, a digital form of gold.  in that sense, yes, DB uses will get de-priortized even if we eliminate the limit and institutions come in and try to make it so.  eventually, Bitcoin will be acknowledged to be a currency and then it will take over the $5T/day Forex mkt, which is the biggest on the planet.  after all, fiat printing is really where the problem is and what Bitcoin was created to fix.  when that happens, the exchange price will have no upper bound.

Which simply can't be managed or discovered by controlling a block size limit. It has to be found by the free market.

I don't think censor is the appropriate characterization. They *have* to select which TX's to process given the stupid limit. The fact that they actually can do this is important to our argument for bigger blocks and for no limit in general.

how can i tell if my S6 has Trusted UI?  just got mine yesterday.
@_date: 2015-09-17 15:23:36
first off,  a rogue miner won't create a 1TB block.  if you'll recall, the self mined single tx multi UTXO dust clearing 1MB f2pool block mined about a month ago took 25 sec to validate. your 1TB should theoretically take 25,000,000 sec to validate if i simply extrapolate out the time required.  since an avg block interval is 600 sec, this block would clearly be orphaned since blocks don't get relayed until they get verified.
second, other miners in receipt of a massive attack bloat block can immediately resort to spv mining a 0-1tx block off the header of the bloat block.

@_date: 2015-09-13 04:13:34
I think we have to go back and look at history. 
The relay network has only been functional since September of last year and spawned by Matt Corallo. Given his Blockstream affiliation, I'd bet it was in reaction to the fear of a large miner large block attack on small miners coming out of China (the top 5 miners). Core dev likes to blame Chinese miners for SPV mining but I think they are reacting to the relay network encouraging it's non verification activity. 
I think both are encouraging the wrong activity and should be verifying blocks and their TX's as they come through. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:14:53
that's precisely why we need bigger blocks to allow non chinese miners to leverage their superior access to higher bandwidths and grow Bitcoin mining security outside of China.

While he didn't specifically mention them, they are most certainly incorporated into his concept of orphaning. 
I can assure you Peter_R is acutely aware of all the various heretofore discussed mining attacks as we have debated them endlessly in my gold thread. 
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:22:59
Forcing an upgrade in bandwidth isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could be a very good thing. Look, you'll never be able to keep everyone happy and Bitcoin is about letting the free market incentive based on sound money play itself out.

gvts hold Google responsible for results from all sorts of searches that ppl do (see Google, Europe, and censoring).  why not Blockstream for the tx's their products might facilitate?
and before you say "open source", why would corporations or institutions that pay $millions to BS for sidechain products not force them to sign a non-compete not to back port to Bitcoin, esp when it can be enforced by holding a gun to core dev heads?
@_date: 2015-09-14 01:46:52
i don't but when he doesn't even mention any other variables except block size goes up causing security goes down show me either he doesn't understand that he should be using a multivariate analysis or he's being intellectually dishonest.
@_date: 2015-09-20 13:38:04
No, because to actually store data, they have to buy BTC to make real and valid TX's. That will drive the price. 
Stop engaging in nerd economics. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:42:43
what does that even mean?
of course they have an incentive to defend themselves against a large block attack; they don't want to choke on it and let the attacker get ahead.  they'll mine an empty block instead.  
furthermore, if the block is too large and the attacker persists in making these, they'll eventually get orphaned and lose money.
finally, an attacker won't attack the network and destroy Bitcoin given the investments they've made.

@_date: 2015-09-20 16:46:31
Bitcoin miners are still more decentralized than LN hubs will be; by far.  and LN hubs compete for fees with miners which isn't good for overall Bitcoin security.

@_date: 2015-09-20 17:17:17


those would be just clearing tx's with fees a fraction of what could've been paid to miners. b/c mining will then weaken, settlement layer as a concept will weaken substantially.
@_date: 2015-09-20 16:49:32
for the same reason small blockists argue that Bitcoin full nodes can be tracked, LN hubs can be as well.  
you didn't address the fact that LN hubs will be taking tx fees away from miners, which isn't good.

another thing here. 
coders only code ideas.  as Amir Taaki says, code reflects the values and biases of it's authors.
Bitcoin is about an idea; that of monetary freedom thru an apolitical form of money that cannot be debased.  the code merely enforces these ideas.  and that is what my gold thread has always been about; elucidating the ideas and suppositions behind what Bitcoin is all about. 
it's about trying to keep us on track.

By raising block size, he thinks large miners will attack snall miners with a large block attack. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:27:08


mining was much smaller back then and many of us were mining on our laptops.  it's much bigger now with much more investment money on the line in the form of hardware.  these larger miners aren't going to try such a low yield highly theoretical attack just to try and "put small miners out of biz".  staying in biz depends on many others factors than just a simple attack like this.
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:57:24
You just contradicted yourself mainly because your argument makes no sense. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 02:17:23


au contraire.  it has been hotly contested.  there are hoards of small blockists who believe that irrational miners will drive themselves and all of Bitcoin off the cliff in a Tragedy of the Commons by processing every single tx that comes thru w/o regard to cost.
@_date: 2015-11-29 15:49:41
yeah, the first thing that came to mind when reading the OP was:  "PETERTODD_NOT_ACCEPTED".
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:25:34
i think when blocks get full again and mempools get jacked high, if RBF tx's start coming thru with equivalent fees to other tx's, they will start getting sequestered away as unconfirms by miners in aggregate, hoping to force senders to up the fee.
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:56:26
he got you to admit that there is a fee mkt equilibrium.  that's more than i can say about your other buddies.
with the increasing adoption from bigger blocks and advancing tech we will get more full nodes.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:25:19
it's ok.
what do you expect from r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:30:03
no, look back at the conditions i laid out.  full blks with RBF fees equal to reg tx's.  in that scenario, which is very reasonable, RBF tx's will be deprecated in hopes of forcing higher RBF fees.
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:40:26
i think the answer lies in what you think is in the mind of the average Bitcoiner.  is he using BTC as a SOV, as a new form of money that has the potential to appreciate greatly in value, ie Moon, b/c of it's fixed supply?  and, whether or not he feels he gets just enough anonymity and tx speed on MC to satisfy him?
or does he view BTC simply as a means to speculate on some SC casino or prediction market? 
personally, it's the former for me, as i view the CB printing presses as enemy  right now.  that's why i hodl and would never leave the MC for a SC.  it's just not necessary and would be too risky.  not to mention a hassle.
we'll see who's right in assessing this situation. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:04:19
It's quite possible. 
If bitcoin is to be successful, we need to have the price much higher to expand liquidity for more and larger TX's. I still think it's s binary situation.
Unfortunately, the block size is an issue that could cap the rally. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:30:01


and just after more than a 1000 nodes got knocked off the network during the last stress test, devs like Todd were saying "oh no, nodes aren't that important".
@_date: 2015-09-03 01:15:41
no, orphaned b/c a huge block like that takes too much time to propagate.
and yeah, just like miners are currently ignoring large spam tx's of 1800B with 0.0008 BTC fees, they *could* ignore a large spam block if it's obvious it's meant to try and disrupt the network.
bottom line is, other miners and full nodes have the ability to defend themselves unlike you're implying.
@_date: 2015-11-10 02:07:00
nah, this attack doesn't make sense.  there are many unknown factors about the small miners that effect their profitability and ability to survive such a convoluted attack.
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:15:45
no.  founders continue to get a disproportional  from an IPO compared to regular investors.  as they should since they came up with the idea and established the company.  point being, Bitcoin early adopters were the ones who funded the lean, high risk early days when it wasn't anywhere near clear that it would become the success it has.
@_date: 2015-11-20 03:18:47
yeah, i agree, who are you what's your name, affiliation, training, pay, etc?  why are you into Viacoin?
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:40:22
Large block attack 
@_date: 2015-11-24 23:07:19


this dynamic is certainly applicable to MC.  but the exact opposite might be concluded for a SC.  the pool might conclude that SC's are taking tx fees away from their much easier job of mining them on MC and decide to kill the competitive SC w/o the consequence of losing their investment in their hardware.
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:39:08
and that incentive is almost infinite given that fiat money printing is definitely infinite.  as in, users of Bitcoin are sick and tired of having their money devalued.
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:13:45
They probably will be. 
But this time I'm sure they're prepared not only to defend but also to more quickly find the attacker and jail him. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:41:24
you're ignoring the obvious. and they just told you what the problem is.
we need bigger blocks to clear the unconfirms so BTCC doesn't have to offer this service to their unhappy clients who are stuck with delayed tx's.

totally expected with the promotion of SPV wallets even on bitcoin.org.


it's very difficult to project the cost of running a full node out into the future.  as you should know, blocks sizes won't skyrocket immediately.  it will take time for growth of new users and merchants.  at the same time, storage, RAM, and bandwidth costs will be coming down.  if you believe in free mkts miners will also monitor full node  as they produce bigger blocks since they want to maintain as much decentralization in full nodes as they know it's important for their security even tho they're not paying for them.  miners will be economically rational, not irrational.


b/c merchants/corporations will have a fiduciary duty to run them and they can easily justify the costs.

the problem that i see repeatedly by devs in Bitcoin is that you are looking for "hard" security.  no such thing exists.  Bitcoin depends on probabilistic security; which it does very well.  and is quite satisfactory for the real world of merchants.
that is why we haven't seen *any* significant complaints along the lines of double spending over the last 6yrs.  what RBF proposes is a solution looking for a problem.

Marshall Long in his AMA says he doesn't care about fees.  and neither do the large Chinese miners given how often they SPV mine.  for them, it's all about the orphan rate.  they won't be attacking small miners with large blocks.
@_date: 2015-11-22 22:59:54


first off, no one expects a plaque.  esp me.
but when you say what i just highlighted, it tells me you fail to understand that coding is only one aspect of what makes Bitcoin successful.  it takes investors, miners, merchants and most of all users.  the latter of which are being cut off and unhappy with unconfirms which is exactly why BTCC just implemented Priority, as they told you.

Adam, why is it when you get down votes, it's somehow a conspiracy but when maaku7 gets a bunch of up votes for his post about centralization in Bitcoin on reddit, you extol the virtue of such a system? Have a listen at 30:48;
Same podcast you linked above. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:14:23
it is irrational in aggregate.
here's Marshall Long's presentation from Scaling Bitcoin where he says that miners don't care about tx's.  they will keep blocks small for the primary objective of mining the reward.  he's a miner and you're not:  
furthermore, look at all the Chinese miners (the biggest of all) mining SPV blocks with 0 tx's in them whenever we get up to full blocks.  just goes to show you they *won't* just include any 0 fee tx's let alone those *with* fees.
@_date: 2015-11-06 09:53:32
Yeah, lots of bold claims in there. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 15:26:21
most miners are ignoring this free space currently and charging fees for all tx's included in a block.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:39:28
But in this case, because Bitcoin involves some code, coders are telling us they are the only ones who know anything about how it works and therefore the rest of us should just shut up and listen to them. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:24:13
you didn't address the part of destruction of SOV by forcing migration to a new sidechain.  which Blockstream stands to benefit in a huge way if it happens since they, as insiders and potentially early adopters of such a sidechain, could be the recipients of a huge transfer of wealth.  especially since they are in a core position to stall/halt growth of the mainchain resulting in a much greater chance of deprecation.  which is what i'd claim is happening now by blocking bigger blocks.
as for LN &amp; SC's, i still think they have first mover advantage to profit from as insiders.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:58:30
Keep at it Gavin. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:16:18
who's going to construct such an attack block and why?  an irrational miner/gvt?  they would have to buy a significant % of current hashrate to get a block in.  it won't be current large miners certainly b/c they are all behind the GFC with poor bandwidth.  smaller miners outside of China don't have the hashpower to make such an attack profitable either.
assuming a large block like that did get through, yes it could be a problem in that it has to get added to the chain but there is a small chance it could get orphaned by another miner's small block since validation takes time and will delay relay, ignoring the relay network of course (i disagree with it's policies of relaying w/o validation but thats another matter). there's no perfect answer there but i would've thought an irrational miner would have already tried this back when blocks were 250kB or so with a 1MB block attack but they didn't.  
@_date: 2015-11-22 23:15:01


i know they don't.  but it's the only compensator that employs 9 core devs, 2 committers, issues stock options, has investment money ($21M), and is attempting to steer tx's offchain to their products LN &amp; SC's which they will profit from via consulting contracts and deployment of hubs and SC's thru tx fees.  not to mention the fact that Bitcoin mainchain could be obsoleted by a dominant SC which would destroy all SOV functions inherent in Bitcoin (they say migration can happen in the WP).
@_date: 2015-11-29 04:26:35


what are u talking about?  once seen, a node won't relay a double spend.  that's security in and of itself.  it's been that way from the beginning w/o any problems at all.  no one's been complaining about this esp the one's who count.  it's simply overzealous, conflicted devs who are doing all the centralized worrying.

it is a defense in the sense that it doesn't slow down the receiving miner in solving the next block.
and if the bloat block validation time starts getting into the timeframe of the next block (10 min), it's chances of orphaning start to skyrocket.

@_date: 2015-11-16 02:59:13
easy.  in a competitive free mkt like Bitcoin, mining actors are trying to make profit, not go out of business.  while certain irrational miners may go out of business by doing stupid things, the more rational and better business minded miners will not process tx's for free thus forcing a fee mkt, as and i have already agreed.
@_date: 2015-09-14 04:28:08


i'm assuming here you've moved on from block size to a bigger Bitcoin Network as a whole.
that's funny, when Bitcoin was much smaller than it is now, i was much more concerned than i am now when it has spread to more continents and has more users.  by extension, the bigger it gets from here, it will become even more secure in it's decentralization as more users means more widespread demand and a decreased ability of gvts to take Bitcoin away from it's citizens.  
having said that, if Bitcoin stays at 1MB blocks with the size it is, i will again become concerned with the small niche size and centralization as the block rewards dwindle.  that means tx fees will have to increase dramatically to pay miners what they are paid now.  that will mean less users overall with the only ones being able to afford transacting on the blockchain being large entities and high net worth individuals who tend to be easily reached and regulated by the long tentacles of gvt regulation/intimidation b/c they are large targets with much more to lose.
with bigger blocks and a bigger network, the  nodes should expand greatly from what it is now b/c users reaching into the billions will encourage new merchants to run full nodes out of a fiduciary duty to their customers.  i could see these numbering into the hundreds of thousands number.  
furthermore, with this type of growth, the price should skyrocket and you and i with our current coin holdings should easily be able to afford hosting several full nodes.  i host a bunch now and would expect that not to decrease as my coin values would easily support them.
if you insist on making Bitcoin a settlement network, the only ones who should really be interested in running a full node are settlement institutions, like banks and exchanges.

In the debate with Gavin, he also said he doesn't value the wisdom of the crowd. He sees this block size debate solely as a technical issue; which is wrong. It's just as much about economics and game theory at which I think he sucks. 
You might think that's harsh but in the entire series of the latest podcasts by him, he continuously invokes the Tragedy of the Commons for mining without ever once mentioning that there are multiple other variables involved; such as financial constraints. 
When actors are financially threatened, they will immediately seek to alter one of the other variables in mining to sustain profitability, otherwise go out of business. 
This was the crux of Peter_R's paper; an economic equilibrium will be found through block size limitations by miners themselves. Not blocks to the moon implosion. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:11:12
i'm quite sure that by anything you mean coding.  since when has that been the measure?
where were you or even some of the core devs back at the end of 2011 when the price was plunging yet guys like me were pouring money into the space to support the price and infrastructure while evangelizing just why Bitcoin was still a very viable project not to be discarded?

@_date: 2015-11-10 01:53:35
i first objected to this theory here when pwuille brought it up b/c it was inconsistent from what they had been lamenting about before (it never ends) which was consistently too small of blocks and what we all had been seeing on the network:
evidence that i am right about this issue first came when we got the fork caused by BIP66.  the fork came about not from a bug in the BIP.  it came about b/c Chinese miners did not actually enforce their upgraded software despite indicating that they would and thus f2pool lost about 5-6 blocks in a row that they had SPV mined when the network had to revert the fork back into consensus. turns out a large % of large miners from China were defensively SPV mining esp when we started getting full blocks back in July.  i've mentioned how gmax expressed surprise when finding out to what extent the Chinese were doing this.  they had/are been using SPV mining b/c of their bandwidth restrictions.  so it turns out in essence that the largest of all miners, the Chinese, cannot execute a large block attack against small miners.  furthermore, today while re-listening to the Gavin/Adam podcast, i came across this gem where Adam admits they had misjudged the degree of SPV mining but also admits that he now realizes that **miner's first priority is to prevent orphaning**:
listen at 6:35:  
i bring this up b/c it supports the findings of paper where miner's have a huge incentive to create small enough blocks to maximize propagation for the block reward b/c latency is indeed a problem.  this incentive should still apply in the absence of a limit.
it also highlights the fact that core dev is quite capable of misjudging incentives across the network and in Bitcoin in general.  despite producing code that technically was correct, they misjudged what miners were economically doing and why.  thus, Pieter also caused a fork in Bitcoin, just like Mike.  but not from technical ignorance but from economic ignorance.

ok, at least we're getting somewhere in the sense that you are not trying to hide the fact that the counterparties are indeed identifiable and track tx's requiring trust.

i'm talking about the time period where bitcoin.org was *primarily* reconmmending SPV wallets b/c it didn't want to burden new users with having to fully DL the blockchain.  i disagreed with that strategy.


you're selectively quoting me.  you left out the part i just said about you and i being perfectly capable and desirous of continuing to run full nodes b/c of wanting to protect the investment we already have in Bitcoin and the fact that it will stay affordable given that the price will rise with greater adoption. 


why would they behave any different than you and i who insist on running our own nodes to verify our personal tx's?  after all, these are businesses who push thru way more tx's than you and i and therefore have an *obligation* to make sure they're transacting securely.  esp when the cost of the node can be written off and is an insignificant portion of their cost structure.  we already see big businesses in Bitcoin doing this.

i think that by defiinition, SC's can never achieve 100% merge mining from the MC.  1. b/c most miners can't be bothered to harvest minimal fees while rewards are still significant on MC for years to come, 2. it's complex for a pool operator to code and maintain multiple mining software implementations
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:51:52


they will have a positive externality in that the more users and merchants that come onboard as a result will increase the  nodes spun up.  this will be much more affordable than you think b/c the price will rise with increasing adoption.

The difficulty here is that you have to be careful how you define "from". 
If you'll notice, I am saying that anyone can easily see which addresses coins are sent from at a technical level if I ignore the identity of the real world person sending them. What you and iwikcox are trying to say is that one can't determine "who" controls the private key of the sending address which is true especially when it comes to Web wallets. "From" depends on if a person is involved or not in your analysis.

It's not good when the core devs have a financial interest in seeing TX's shunted to SC's instead of staying on mainchain. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:38:40
All 6 of mine are too. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:48:22
first off, go here to look at my node stats.  note that despite the RAM/vswap congestion, i'm only using 6% of my bankdwidth.  that's nothing.  the network, from a propagation standpoint, my node is handling this attack just fine:  


the whole concept around No Limit is trusting the involved economic actors (miners, nodes, &amp; users) to do their job in mitigating these same types of attacks via financial motivation.  NOT depending on financially uninvolved core dev to make those determinations, which they can't, b/c they don't have the relevant financial info.  protection against bloat can be done in a variety of ways.  for miners: they are free to incl whatever tx's they want for profitability.  they will do this otherwise go BK.  for nodes: minfee to protect against crashing.
once attackers realize they can't disrupt the system by jacking mempools, the attacks will stop.


the problem with this strategy is it's disruptive and totally unnecessary if we lift the cap.  you can't expect users and nodes to constantly raise, then lower, their minfee settings, inc RAM/swap, and for users to pay inconsistent fees.  that's called "volatility" and is bad for growth.
@_date: 2015-10-23 14:25:24

i'll admit there's no question that the bailouts forestalled a massive economic *pullback*.  the problem is that the folks in charge like to pretend or insist that everyone is on a level playing field when they are not.  it's only bailouts for big business or the financial sector.  there's no question in my mind that there is a bailout mentality that has been fed to the ppl who have the best and easiest access to the printing press or discount window.  this encourages reckless speculation b/c, as you say, in the end it is rewarded.  no one goes to prison and losses are forestalled.  it's happened numerous times ever since we depegged in 1971.  if the financial elite just admitted the problem and said "bailouts for all" (even underwater homeowners) and zero % loans for all, then i might agree with the approach.  but no, they pretend that we have some sort of egalitarian system and the bailed out banks hold smaller debt holders under the gun.  fortunately with the internet and now Bitcoin, ppl are catching on and notice they have a choice in the matter.  yeah, i'll take my chances on a mathematically based algorithm over a group of what i feel are corrupted men who take advantage of the system created by the Fed.  that's how bad the situation has gotten for some of us.  it's risky but i do think we're entering a new world.

@_date: 2015-03-25 04:52:37
that's bullshit.  
take 2008 as an example.  the only ones who made money, and tons of it, were beneficiaries of the bailouts which suspended all their losses.  we even had to change the fundamental accounting system for those idiots; from market to market to mark to model.  how convenient; inflate value on the way up and prop those same values on the way down.  all so they didn't have to liquidate their debt based speculative toxic investments.  plus, we had to cut interest rates to zero to lend them free money to prop themselves up.  did avg Americans get zero % loans or guarantees? hell no.  and don't try to tell me i did b/c i checked religiously during that time.
any Bitcoin wealth disparity was earned by those investors taking loads of risk in a nascent system that could've failed.  the bailouts in the USD system of today represent an archaic corrupted system that has been hollowed out to the point that only well connected elite can profit and their attitude is that the game is coming to an end so they might as well get while the getting is good before it all blows to  hell.
@_date: 2015-03-23 04:17:36
i upvoted you for showing some sense of reason.  i agree with just about everything you just said.  but our perspectives on how to handle it differ greatly.
i for one had a huge short on stocks from the October of 2007 which was making huge hay during the crisis.  that's how speculators/investors like me were looking at this at the time; an obvious bubble waiting to blow.  the problem with your argument that the earth would have spun off its axis and plunged us into the sun is that i stood ready to close that short and *buy*.  i never got that chance b/c the Fed never let the mkts *clear*.  by all rights, several others of the primary dealers should've gone under which i would argue would have made for a healthier system coming out.  instead, what we have now is 4 major behemoth banks that are way larger than before and pose a much greater systemic risk to the system.   we have more than doubled the national debt to accomplish QE. at some point, this pedal to the metal philosophy has to reverse.  ppl are getting angry.  i happen to be in a very respected, well paid field that has suffered the consequent cuts in pay to help finance these bailouts and it is aggravating as hell to experience when i think i can easily see what is going on.  there has never been an industry in the history of the world that has made so many excuses and whiny arguments to be bailed out.  there is nothing special about finance ppl, imo.

But of course, you're the ones not wanting freedom of choice. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:27:21
do you see how your argument could also be justification for eliminating a limit altogether?  nodes could just raise their minfee and stop a spam attack similarly.
more to your point, expecting node operators to constantly keep raising and then lowering their minfee settings across all their nodes every month or so like we've been having to do, is not practical at all or good for network growth and consumer confidence.  most node operators don't have the foggiest idea how to change their settings, let alone have to do it so frequently to fend off these attacks.  
the only reason these attacks are feasible is b/c they only have to fill 500kB of empty block space before they can start jacking the mempool.  w/o a limit or with a big limit, they couldn't do this w/o taking losses from paying miners fees they desperately need.

larger blocks would halt the spam as it just feeds the profits of the miners, which is the last thing the attacker wants.  plus, it could bankrupt the spammer.
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:10:49


this shows how little you know.  of course it directly is a result of the 1MB cap.  b/c there is a trivial amount of remaining space to fill via spam (500kB), it is easy for the spammer to jack up the mempool to the ridiculous 1GB it currently is.  this causes the crashing of the 569 nodes you cited.  AND, he doesn't have to pay for it.
do you have a problem with logic?

The entire settlement layer concept came about due to the failure of gold as a good money. Too heavy, too bulky, not portable for everyday use, especially between countries. It got so bad that Nixon got rid of it in 1971. 
Bitcoin doesn't have those restrictions so if you want to cripple it as the ideal money, keep relegating it to a settlement layer. We'll probably then get rid of Bitcoin too.

It does not cost the attacker $25k because most of those clogged TX's in the mempool just roll off after 24-48h and never get processed due to the cap. With bigger blocks and the ability to process, only then will the attacker have to pay those fees. 
Plus, the attacker under current rules can recycle those unpaid fees towards new spam.

what's so hard to understand is believing that the 2 lead agents directly in contact with DPR were *impartial* in their collection of evidence given that they *knowingly* were stealing money from SR themselves, laundering it, and depositing it to their own accts.  they had every incentive to *frame* DPR.  are you that dense?

It's much harder to successfully appeal a verdict that has already been rendered. It would have been smarter to delay awaiting the release of this contaminated agent information.

given the corruption that the 2 main gvt agents who interfaced with DPR committed, it's impossible to tell what exactly he did or didn't do.  they had every motive to frame him in their bald faced attempts to break the law.  in fact, they committed a greater violation of the public trust and should be punished as such while at least DPR was performing a wanted market based public function whether or not you agree with running a drug site.

it has everything to do with inflation that has built up from past excesses.  you're right that there is actual deflation right now as the debt bubble is rolling over, imo.  but some ppl are still stuck with the idea that cash is devaluing so they need to spend it (despite the rise in the USD recently).
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:19:15
no, i get that.  but what u gonna do?  keep chasing your tail?
imo, as i've said all along, the solution to this is to lift the cap altogether and force spam fee losses on the attacker.  right now, it costs him close to nothing to do this as clogged spam rolls off every 24-48 hrs.  1MB gives him an easy target ceiling to shoot at.
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:53:41

his post was terrible b/c of the following statements:


no, you're punishing the ppl who weren't responsible for the malinvestment in the first place.  plus, it's using the same 'ol flawed policy to try and restimulate growth when the bad actors should instead be allowed to fail.


of course it's not malicious; if you're on the receiving end of the bailouts.  like GS, BAC, JPM, AIG, etc.  who then get to turn around and foist their bad debts onto the public.  oh, but we must save the economy, says you.  no, i'd rather the Fed have allowed my shorts on those companies and other bad actors to have gone to the Moon so i could have later invested those monies in more deserving companies.


oh yeah, sure.  what a great option to invest in bonds or UST's at the zero bound after a &gt;30 bull mkt in bonds, ie, the end of the line.  not to mention facilitating more bad policy by a bloated and over indebted gvt.


as the issuance levels off towards 2140, Bitcoin velocity will maximize it's circulation as the speculation will level off.  right now, they're being hodl'd b/c it's still not mainstream and we're still in the rather steep part of the issuance curve.  when we get out to 2140, Bitcoin will simply function as a Sound Money w/o all the speculative hodling.


this presumes the old paradigm of devaluation by CB's is allowed to continue.  Bitcoin may totally change this.

i understand what you're saying but i think it is a little too pessimistic given what looks to have been accomplished.  
it's all about probabilities.  of course, if an attacker gets access to your computer they can do *anything*.  but the vast majority of malware out there right now simply scans for *.wlt to lift the keys.  an improvement such as threshold can circumvent the vast majority of attacks and represents a significant incremental improvement in bitcoin security while improving privacy.
if this concept is verified with testing, i predict it could become a new standard.

i'll take the other side of this one.
fact of the matter is, we don't know how this will turn out.  it's quite possible Bitcoin could turn out to be a one world currency given how interconnected the world is nowadays and even moreso in the future.  especially since if we have to, we can subdivide down further below 8 decimal points if we need more transactional units.  thus, in a non to minimally leveraged world, it would be hard to envision a deflationary spiral as you have eluded to.
more likely, however, we use Bitcoin as a new gold standard, with fiat currencies and debt layered over the top but to a stringent degree like 10:1.  but this again would be a situation where a deflationary spiral would be unlikely.

inflation adjusted wages for the average worker have been falling while those for the 1% have been skyrocketing.  wage inequality is the highest since 1929.  do some reading to verify.

Despite being a Hashfast early adopter, what KNC has shown is that it is possible to develop these ASICs quickly and professionally in a short time period.

but NO, the Fed had to step in and jack the monetary base straight up like a Roman candle:

He's got the sickness. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:06:32
no, i don't agree Erik.
mining goes hand in hand with the merchant economy and investment (speculation).  it is a critical part of Bitcoin as it provides the clearing of tx's and security to the system as a whole.  
vbenes below is correct in that an investor, who might initially look into getting into Bitcoin via mining currently, will look at the exponentially rising hashrate/difficulty and will conclude that it's too competitive and as a result divert his fiat into buying of BTC instead.  he will also conclude that the exponentially rising HR/diff is very good for the security of his investment.
right now, we're seeing HR/diff leading the price; essentially dragging the BTC price higher.  at other times, we might see the opposite; price leading HR/diff and dragging it higher.
all that matters is that fiat is entering the Bitcoin economy in one form or another.  all of which is a very good thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:10:49
precisely. 
save in BTC, let it appreciate in value during that time, then spend when you need or want something at a lower USD price.

@_date: 2013-02-03 16:40:49
this is old but a few new comments.
this was clearly a positive setup for Bitcoin.  we all know Stossel is a staunch Libertarian and has talked positively about Bitcoin in the past.
from the get go you see Mangu (now officially a hotty in my book) smiling in anticipation of the script.  Stossel launches into a fake alarm about the possibilities of Bitcoin while letting Mangu espouse the virtues of what Bitcoin makes possible and the principles behind which it stands.
Stossel betrays himself several times.  he struggles to recall the negatives that have been ascribed to Bitcoin by having to read from a list.  he calls attempted regulation of online gambling "stupid".  he alleges that "stupid reasons" are being given to restrict alternative currencies.  he mocks Schumer by saying that he stands for "anything against good".  
finally, both he and Mangu agree that anything that restricts gov't power and regulation "is a good thing!".
i enjoyed watching it again and it's a great positive interview in Bitcoin's favor.

not so.  what triggered the GFC of 2008 was the "repo" market freezing for the likes of Lehman and Bear.  they no longer acted like "money" as the assets backing them evaporated.  
this then triggered the CDS market domino effect that resulted in AIG owning billions it couldn't pay off to the likes of GS et al.  the leverage that derivatives allow are "weapons of mass destruction" as Warren Buffett has described them.
thus, the US gov't (cue taxpayers) had to step in and save AIG with TARP, etc, who demise would have probably caused the end of the system as we know it.

sometimes he gets his economics a little mixed up.  like when he was screaming about asics causing an irreparable centralization of Bitcoin mining which would lead to its' downfall.  wrong.  we've seen dozens of asic manufacturers crop up with plunging prices for these units which will only serve to strengthen the mining industry and Bitcoin security.
you can't stop progress which is what asics are all about and any other future iterations of mining.  this dovetails nicely with the Bitcoin concept.

you have a severe misunderstanding of how this all works.
copying the protocol exactly, by say govt, does nothing except promote the same Bitcoin we're all using currently.  there would be no point.
therefore, authors of altcoins change some property of the Bitcoin protocol in an attempt to *benefit themselves in some way* by being a founder or first mover of said altcoin.  they do this to benefit themselves in an economic sense usually.
the jig is up on these lame attempts to capitalize on Bitcoin's success.  the marketplace is on to them and refuses to infuse money or mining capacity to support these poor actors.  this is exactly why you see Bitcoin continuing to thrive and altcoins continuing to languish.
nice try though.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:32:33
it isn't.
for instance, i haven't leveraged my newsletter business so i don't have to worry about getting caught by a downdraft in the price.  other businesses should do the same.  if they wait it out long enough, the coins they earn will be worth way more than when they were received.

sure, but Bitcoin hasn't had a chance to stabilize yet.  as the asymptotic issuance curve levels out, we will have more price stability.
your concerns should gradually go away.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:24:49
the volatility will progressively level off, just as the assymptotic issuance curve.  
that's not a bad thing as the market seeks to find its fair market value.  it's a myth that a currency that continuously increases in value is a bad thing.  au contraire, it's a great thing not to be manipulated by a small, secretive cabal like the Fed.

this is a very good question.
i was listening to an EconTalk podcast this weekend whereby the presenter was quoting the works of Hayek vs Keynes.  turns out, Hayek was in favor of limited regulation of free markets according to this presenter.  Keynes made a very good point in saying that once you move one inch away from a totally free market ideal towards limited regulation, you're trapped in attempting to define what that is and how far it goes.
not an easy question as i do believe we need gov't for certain types of public services.  but then you could argue you're favoring the workers in those industries.
@_date: 2013-06-25 20:35:15
i realize that you were using the word "our" in reference to Bitcoin.  that was my entire point.
you pretend to be sympathetic to Bitcoin's cause but in reality are a skeptic throwing around FUD for your entire argument.  
the fact of the matter is that *because* Bitcoin is doing so well recently, as reflected in the price appreciation in April *and* the growth of it's economy, is precisely why the authorities are beginning to act out against it in uncoordinated spasmodic ways.
and brace yourself.  despite all your skepticism and FUD, it will continue.  as in growth and adoption.

from James A. Donald:


in the same relation to account money as gold stood in
the days of the gold standard.  The binks, not trusting
each other to be liquid when liquidity is most needed,
settle out any net discrepancies with each other by
moving bit coins around once every hundred thousand
seconds or so, so bitcoins do not change owners that
often,   Most transactions cancel out at the account
level.  The binks demand bitcoins of each other only
because they don't want to hold account money for too
long. So a relatively small amount of bitcoins
infrequently transacted can support a somewhat larger
amount of account money frequently transacted.
this layered account money as Donald refers to could end up being the USD.

i disagree.
i think it demonstrated a distinct lack of understanding of free markets.  he says that Bitcoin is not competing in the marketplace as it is an "automaton".  ridiculous.  BTC started off as zero and in &lt;5 yr is at $266 an all time high.
Bitcoin also is not inconsistent with Hayek's principles of free market based money.
he also assumes that gov'ts can clamp down on Bitcoin.  granted this remains to be seen but i don't think they can.
he also says gov'ts are needed to "free a debtor from his obligations".  does he mean bailout the banks from the wreckage of over indebtedness they created?  i think not.  and he calls that justice.

*"And yes, I feel this is obvious terrible for the fate of our currency. "*
"our" is an interesting term often used by someone who pretends to be supportive in concept and in spirit.  ppl like you like to say it's "our currency" as if to say "i'm with you, but..."
usually, in the context of Bitcoin, it is used by someone who actually is a statist or elitist and who apologizes for actions of a corrupt and dominant group that wishes to hold on to the printing press.  or perhaps they've just been hired to be skeptical.
given the momentum and price rise of Bitcoin over the last 4.5 years, it's highly unlikely the project is just going to fail.  it was designed from the very beginning to handle acts of regulation which we have been seeing over the last couple of months. the proof of work concept is unstoppable. 
it's clear that the regulators are getting nervous and are initiating spasmodic, irrational restrictions like we just saw from California.  this actually is counter productive as the inaccuracy and misapplication of the MTA law in that case is astounding and blatant for all to see.  this only acts to harden Bitcoin proponents and actually will cause those interested in the idea to investigate further.
also, Ponzi's don't bounce.  the long term price rise and bullish consolidation triangle that has formed is telling you that the market is betting on "our currency" to be a success.

the Bull will do it's best to shake off as many skeptics on the way up which means hellacious volatility both up and down.  not everyone can win.

if you are talking about a programmed inflation where everyone has equal first access to the new money created, then i might agree with you.  but i believe you're talking about a continuation of the corrupt system we currently have where Ben Bernanke can surprise markets via his decision making while keeping 0% interest rates at the Fed discount window for his buddies.  this is what i mean about the corruption of inflation in the current system.

"The private key is a scalar value."
pls elaborate.
"you first generate the private key, k"
this seems so....simple.  so via your pc's RNG, you randomly pick a # btwn 0 and 2^256?  given the problems with RNG's via Snowden, you'd think this method would put us at risk of a collision in generating privkeys.

@_date: 2013-12-28 23:06:52
wrong.  Bitcoin has significant backing.
one way to measure this is to total up the number of USD that have been invested into the "market cap", mining equipment, electricity, and merchant startups.  we're in the billions of USD range with that.
also you would have to throw in the value of the amount of time spent by individual backers in terms of coding, innovation, work, etc.  putting an exact number on that would be very difficult but it is a large number.
and then there is the philosophical backing that someone like me is displaying in this conversation.  i am not alone.  there are probably millions of us now.  all of us collectively "back" Bitcoin.  you are missing this.

we're still a ways off to require EVERY cashier at Target to know how to process BTC.  they could have one checkout line for BTC tx's to start off with.  once more experience is gained along with increased adoption, then that would be the time to train more widely.
but here's the vision that a big business should focus on; profits via BTC accumulation.
we all believe the price of BTC will only go up so the faster a large company can acquire and hold BTC, the faster their profits will grow.  on  a smaller scale that's what i've done with my subscription service is just hold on to what i've been paid in BTC and watched those holdings increase.

no, last weeks fork was due to a "technical" glitch in BDB which prevented block 225430 from constructing a 975KB block.  once we move to 0.8.1 we'll be in LevelDB and at a 1MB block size limit w/o that same limitation.
if we agree to expand that 1MB limit, LevelDB has the capability of going above 1MB w/o causing a fork from 0.8.1 due to the absence of the BDB "bug" that led to last weeks fork.
my understanding is that 1MB is not hardcoded into the protocol in the sense that it cannot be changed.  it CAN be changed as long as a majority consensus wants it to happen.

this is a very good question.
i was listening to an EconTalk podcast this weekend whereby the presenter was quoting the works of Hayek vs Keynes.  turns out, Hayek was in favor of limited regulation of free markets according to this presenter.  Keynes made a very good point in saying that once you move one inch away from a totally free market ideal towards limited regulation, you're trapped in attempting to define what that is and how far it goes.
not an easy question as i do believe we need gov't for certain types of public services.  but then you could argue you're favoring the workers in those industries.
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:28:46
WTF!!!

@_date: 2013-12-20 19:41:30
blockchain size as a problem is your opinion as well.  it is a hotly contested issue.  there is plenty of disagreement that hard disk storage won't keep up.  also, forcing ppl to "pull their addresses forward" to a more recently mined block just so you can prune old chunks of the blockchain to mine lost coins has it's own security issues as well.  the deeper the block, the more secure it is due to the embedded POW.  checkpoints further solidify this security but yet you want to undo this just for the sake of mining lost coins.  as i said, if you're concerned about a lack of usable units, pushing the decimal point to the left to 10 to the minus 12 would be a better idea.
i agree that pruning holds some promise theoretically, but as jgarzik has said, if you want the blockchain to remain a no trust system, then you need to allow each client to independently verify every tx going back to the genesis block.
as far as cold addresses are concerned, i'm referring to cold addresses that have never been spent from.  of course, once the public key is exposed from a spend, the security goes down.  not by a significant amount mind you, but it does decrease. but that's not what we're talking about here.
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:21:18
you just demonstrated your flawed thinking.
you can't separate mining from the protocol or currency unit.  w/o mining, there will be no security to prevent your altcoin from being hacked.  we've already seen this multiple times with the result being destruction of said altcoin.
@_date: 2013-01-29 18:51:35

@_date: 2013-06-19 19:46:13
i think there is a slightly better chance since you don't have to get thru the hash also to get to the public key.  i remember etotheipi going thru the math of this once.  don't quote me.

why do you say that?
BTCChina was around in April from 265-50
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:42:46
let me ask you something else.
do you actually *understand* Bitcoin?  i mean really understand it?  as in, do you understand ECDSA or SHA256?  do you understand the concept of a race condition?  how about the Byzantine General's Problem and how it applies to the proof of work function in determining consensus?  do you know what secp256k1 is?  do you understand how private keys in Bitcoin are determined and how the corresponding public key gets derived?  how about generator points or nonces.  or the concept of a Merkle Tree and how tx's are double hashed.  why are public keys double hashed with Ripemd160 and SHA256?  what's the purpose behind that?  is the blockchain really a ledger or is it a chain of tx's?
b/c if you don't understand these things, stop commenting on what's going to happen to Bitcoin.  you are working with imperfect information.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:18:05
nothing is wrong with a fixed supply currency that increases in value as the economy around it grows in size.  inflation is a corrupt ideology that enriches those who control the printing.  at least with Bitcoin, we have a provably fair system.
i do think the deflationary aspects of Bitcoin do contribute to volatility.  it's b/c speculators expect the value to increase over time so they are heavily into trading BTC to take advantage of dips.
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:35:00
right on.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:58:13
The entire deflation inflation debate is a non starter until you acknowledge the following :
Our current monetary system is controlled by a select few men who run the printing presses when they please. This leads to asymmetry of information and inevitably to corruption. 
This needs to change. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:36:35
fine.  don't believe me.  i don't really care.
but as i said, i started @ 1.60 and i've lived thru 5 crashes.  they don't bother me b/c i understand that this is normal behavior for a new form of money that started at 0 and went as high as 1242 in less than 5 yrs.  bull markets will do their darndest to shake off as many weak hands as possible before heading higher.  not everyone will make see it through b/c they haven't done their homework or are just weak minded.  
there will only ever be 21M units.  if only 1% of the gold market moves to Bitcoin we're talking about $381,000/BTC.  and that ignores any inputs from stocks, bonds, commodities and the enormous forex markets.  just about anyone involved in Bitcoin for any length of time is sittting on significant gains.
i seriously doubt that anything will happen to Bitcoin given that every hacker, skeptic, and academic has tried to poke holes in the code and economic underpinnings over the last 5 yrs and has failed.
but you could be the ONE to be right.  keep on going.

none of your arguments that inflation is good and deflation is bad can even begin w/o an acknowledgement from you that it is unfair that a small cabal of bankers will gain the most from controlling the printing press and the resulting inflation.  the most extreme example being the bailouts of 2008.

don't get me wrong.  from what i've seen of them, i like.  and they are doing a great service for Bitcoin with this whole project.  but in the end, it would just seem not right for them to pocket any profits from the donations.  those were meant to get them thru the 3 mo honeymoon.  their dreams for international travel are also being fulfilled.  i don't begrudge them any of those aforementioned objectives.  perhaps they might set aside anything left over for the "next couple" willing to do such a thing.

your lame ass analogy shows you clearly know nothing about economics.
a ticket to a show is a "consumption good" that has a one off value that is extinguished at the time of show.  you barely value it; lost tickets are no big deal.  
otoh, coding, mining hardware, and starting a merchant business all are long term "investments" in an industry with a perceived future all of which the investor deeply cares about.  most of these investors will do anything to make those investments work.  such as taking additional time to modify the code when necessary (Bitcoin open source advancements like BIP's), tweaking mining hardware physically or with coding to enhance performance, or administering the hardware on an ongoing basis.  a commitment to pay the monthly electrical costs has been made.  startups are also a long term investment into which the creators will pour all sorts of resources to ensure success.  we're seeing this type of investment all across the Bitcoin space and it has been going on for 5 yrs now.

Given the arrogance with which you've been replying, it's shocking really to know you didn't realize the Fed was privately held. Instead of impulsively reacting to what data and facts I've outlayed, I suggest you think about the implications of that profound fact. Read The Creature from Jekyll Island for some illumination. 
TLDR: it means EVERYTHING. 
Furthermore, to say inflation disproportionately affects the rich more than the poor reflects a severe misunderstanding of basic economics. Who gets whacked more from higher food and gas prices? Who doesn't benefit from soaring stock or bond prices? Who doesn't benefit directly from bailouts or cash handouts from the Fed? Who didn't benefit directly by TARP handouts?  Answer : the poor and middle classes.

your entire argument is incomplete as it ignores the fact that what we have currently is a cabal of banksters who control the inflationary process you deem so beneficial.  
what you say might be correct if EVERYONE had access to 0% interest rates at the Feds discount window.  problem is, only banksters have that access. and in fact, given the massively unpopular bailouts (one poll showed &gt;90% disapproval) that were conducted in 2008, it has been shown to be a corrupt system that has lost the trust of the common ppl who lost their homes to those same banks that got bailed out.

@_date: 2013-12-16 03:51:19
this is a very good point.  but the 2-3% fee issue is a very small part of the problem.  we are talking trillions.
you should emphasize the real costs of the current financial system like the $21B in loan guarantees we gave the Wall St banks, the $800B in TARP, along with 5 yr worth of 0% financing at the Fed discount window.   not to mention that the financial industry at it's peak in 2008 was about 40% of the S&amp;P 500.
not to mention the blind eye that has been turned to Libor rigging, money laundering by HSBC and other banks, MF Global, etc.  the criminals are in charge.
oh, and how about $85B per mo to keep their asset game afloat?
where was my bailout?  last i looked, if i had defaulted on my mortgage or missed a payment on my business loan, both would have been taken away from me.  
not to mention the continued cutting of fees to my industry just to keep the wealth transfer alive and well aka keeping Wall St bonuses at all time highs.  thus, we've created an hour glass wealth distribution with much of the middle class hurt as a result.

@_date: 2013-12-28 22:29:01
btw, check your facts.
one of the great paradoxes (?) of the stock market crash of 2008-9 was that the USD *rose*, not fell.  this was totally confusing for most market players.  but if you understood that debt destruction was occurring at unprecedented and deflationary levels, it made sense that the 98% USD devaluation since the 1913 creation of the Fed was going into reverse as debt is also money.  the only way to save the bankster system was to print even greater amounts of bailout money to fill the collapsing debt hole before it totally imploded while debasing the USD at the same time.  this is why you see the Roman Candle spike in the monetary base with the majority of that fresh money going to banks in exchange for the bad debt they had created.  we are now stuck with a fake recovery and our national debt has doubled.  if interest rates jump or even go back to their long term average, the interest payments will explode as will our taxes.  we could very well have pension and deposit seizures like Cyprus.
its a corrupt system.  Bitcoin establishes a fair playing field.

that last sentence doesn't make sense to me.  an address is a hash of a public key; i thought a feature of a hash is that if one tries to change any bit of the input (public key) the result will be an entirely different hash (address).  so how can multiple different pub keys result in the same hash?
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:15:06


i still say it's a bad idea.  
yes, if the protocol needs to be changed then force transfers, but not just for the sake of mining "assumed lost coins".  you can never be sure you're not infringing on someones inactive but unlost address.  and what would be the point?  Bitcoin is also divisible down to the Satoshi which can be redefined if necessary which would be a much more reasonable approach to increase the # of units.
also migrating cold wallet addresses is not considered best practice imo.

the OP is completely off premise.
"the people" don't have "full control" over Bitcoin.  the "marketplace" does.  and it includes gov't.  they are free to seize as many BTC as they want and do whatever they want with them.  in fact, if they destroy or hoard them, i'd say that is bullish for Bitcoin in general.
the key point is that Satoshi designed a protocol that allows the network to reach a "consensus" as to the direction it takes.  that consensus happens to allow a majority of the peoples wishes to be achieved.  so what that a small group of ppl have gained control of what really is a small # of BTC.  they can't use them to effect the marketplace in any negative way.  
Natanael_L put it correctly below.  the network effect is most important here and Bitcoin can copy any improvements it wants, when it wants, to eliminate competitors.  we should continue to support it's growth.

the "mechanism" by which the Fed "buys back" USD's is via "selling" US Treasuries back into the market. this removes excess USD from the system thus theoretically supporting the USD value by increasing its "scarcity". the problem with this theory is that UST prices would plummet, interest rates would skyrocket, interest payments on the federal debt would skyrocket, and the economy and US gov't funding mechanism would implode. any sophisticated investor does not believe the Fed will ever do this. their solution to every problem is "print". and that is what they would be forced to do even more of to control those skyrocketing interest rates via buying back more UST's which would be an abrupt reversal in strategy which would debase the USD even more. there is no floor on the USD where the Fed is concerned.
look at where we are right now: the Fed and US gov't are trumpeting a fantastic recovery since 2008, yet the Fed refuses to significantly back off on QE. $75B/mo QE is still an enormous amount and is unprecedented. Bernanke is scared to death to do more and is conveniently on his way out the door. Yellen will be left to clean up his mess.
there is no floor on gov't support via taxation either as this presumes the US gov't is invincible and that US taxpayers have infinitely deep pockets. every empire in history has fallen over time usually b/c of monetary debasement. are we so special?

my main disagreement with you is allowing mining of presumed lost coins.  that is a bad idea for the reasons i've stated.
i never said our crypto will last forever.  if and when a clear and present danger appears that threatens SHA 256 or secp256k1 that would be a time to move cold addresses.  but not for the sake of mining lost coins.
btw, i haven't heard from you yet why we should allow that.

Andy, that was superb.  
this video was long but well worth watching all the way thru.  i couldn't stop laughing at first at the sheer brilliance of what you've done along with the nerdiness of the presentation.  there is a very thin veil of humor laced throughout, especially at the end where you drive away.  but not only that, the nerdy practicality and efficiency of what you've done comes thru strongly and there is a serious message that you've sent to TPTB.
i loved the summary at the end too, where you outline the general philosophy of what Bitcoin is all about and how we can now start thinking in terms of how we'll apply this to necessary commodities that we all need to consume.
congratulations on a job well done.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:31:52
i disagree totallly.
i commend Max for laying out the cold, hard facts straight to the face of a banker who tried to obfuscate the truth.
this is exactly how Bitcoin can gain ground quickly.  a point in contrast was the Senate debates where all sorts of mistaken facts about Bitcoin were just let go w/o any correction or challenge.  this just serves to confuse ppl and is not helpful.

@_date: 2013-12-25 16:14:37
maybe it's worth asking why income disparities are levels only seen since 1929, right before the Great Depression?  ans:  it's b/c the Fed is engaging in the same inflationary policies they conducted btwn the 1921 recession and the peak of the stock bubble in 1929.
maybe it's worth asking why middle class incomes today are dropping while Wall St bonuses are at all time highs (not just now but in 2009 immediately after the crisis)?  ans:  the bailouts of 2008 were meant to solely save the banks and debt speculators at the expense of the American ppl.
have you so quickly forgotten how the Wall St banks packaged and sold trillions in bad mortgage CDO's to unsuspecting investors worldwide?   or how they've rigged Libor down to close to 0% to screw shorts and kill municipality hedges?  or loan managers walking around their offices with baseball bats intimidating loan officers and appraisers to push debt onto anyone with a pulse?  or maybe you choose to forget debacles like MFGlobal?  
irresponsible speculators have to be allowed to fail for their bad debts or else those not able to speculate with free money, like most middle to lower class folk, get killed as their savings or what little cash they have gets devalued.

High priority 
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:31:05
but the overindebtedness was caused by the inflating policies of the Fed who has artificially kept interest rates low to encourage irresponsible lending practices.  speculators were encouraged to get rid of cash and leverage up to buy those houses pushing prices to bubble highs.  then came the inevitable bust from those reckless policies.
same thing happened btwn the recession of 1921 and 1929 when the stock market vaulted to unsustainable and reckless highs.

on balance you have to look at who has the better information to make a *responsible loan*.  the bank, with all it's sophisticated computers, accountants, Wall St housing analysts, history, and algorithms or a low income single mom secretary working all day with a baby at home to take care of?
i'd say the bank.  they make those irresponsible loans b/c they know the system.  a system that's backed by a corrupt Fed that hands out bailouts like candy.  under those circumstances, of course the secretary will take free money.

@_date: 2013-12-19 23:34:39
but it has to be volatile if you understand how markets work.
you wouldn't expect it to go up in straight line otherwise everyone would climb on board and it'd be a sure win.  the only place you see this type of action is in the stock market which is being manipulated up by inflation which ends up debasing the currency.  so while you win on one hand you lose on the other.  Bitcoin is not like that.
Bitcoin started at 0 and if it's destined to go to $100,000 a coin according to the binary viewpoint, it has to shrug off as many ppl on the way up by zigzagging like hell to shake off the weak hands.  remember that the bull tries its best to shake off the naysayers.  only a few of us will be able to stomach the volatility all the way up.  only a few can win.

this has been discussed ad nauseum on the forums and the consensus has been it is a bad idea.
one reason being that some individuals might use a Bitcoin stash as a family heirloom passing it down generation to generation so who is anyone to force them periodically to check BitcoinTalk to see if any hairbrained proposal has been enacted to steal their coins after say 10 yrs or so?  some longterm holders just don't check around here as often as you may.  and mandating transfers on a yearly basis or whatever hairbrained timeline is passed could be dangerous just from an exposure process to the internet depending on how much is involved or how secure making those mandated transfers are just to demonstrate activity.
just some thoughts.

of course, if they identify an individual with a wallet that can be legally seized, i'm sure they could do so.  "identify" would be a key word there though.

unfortunately, or not, this is the way the world works.
you can't stop wealthy westerners from speculating in the game.  in fact, i can argue that it's a necessary phenomenon to infuse money (fiat) into the game.  this helps western (and third world) companies build the network and merchant services required to create longstanding infrastructure for all of us, including those third world ppl who will need that stable infrastructure for their future investments and usage into Bitcoin.
bottom line is that those of us who can accept and understand volatility do not need to fear it.
and when i say only a few can win, i mean that only a few will get extraordinarily wealthy from Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will raise all boats for mankind.

his point is that the original idea behind Bitcoin includes maximum decentralization of the blockchain.  many have said that it's size will be a limiting factor for maintaining a full node.  products like this show why this isn't a valid concern.

your disdain for the average guy is appalling.  and this is coming from me, a guy in the 1%.  perhaps it's b/c i grew up with those guys.
i'm more than willing to let something like Bitcoin grow b/c i do think the Fed is corrupt and facilitates all the bad things that happened in the Paulson article.  those corrupt practices affects my bottomline as a businessman too.  
the fact that Bitcoin has gone from 0 to $760 now is evidence that the average guy does understand money much to your surprise.  Bitcoin is resonating with them and the sooner you accept this fact, the better off you'll be.  in fact, you are sensing it; otherwise you wouldn't be hanging around r/Bitcoin trying to stop it.

but no one is migrating to altcoins.  why is this?  perhaps we are saying the same thing when it comes to intrinsic value.  your other points, not so much.
intrinsic value is a meaningless term.  value is imputed by human beings.  if there were no humans on this planet, *nothing* would have intrinsic value.  so for you to claim that Bitcoin has no value b/c you think it has no intrinsic value is also meaningless.
the fact is the marketplace is telling us that Bitcoin has more value, be it intrinsic or not, than altcoins.  period.  
@_date: 2013-06-29 17:01:45
you have to balance that with all the BTC he has in savings.  if a fatal flaw, or even an incrementally better version of Bitcoin came along that required a switch in hashing design, yes, he would have to abandon his old hardware to preserve the value of his BTC itself.
and hardware makers understand this thinking.  everyone knows their designs will eventually become obsolete.  in the meantime, though, he's making millions in BTC, the value of which is more paramount than any hardware designed today.

is the essence that you're using "hashes" to generate the random seed vs. some hardware or software source of randomness?
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:52:09
you still don't get it.
those "sunk costs" as you put are now paying HUGE dividends.  so economically they matter greatly to those ppl and the Bitcoin economy, some of whom have been able to retire from those investments mind you.  plus, those same investments continue to work for those visionary ppl to this day and will continue to do so tomorrow, the day after, and so on as Bitcoin continues to grow.  unlike a show ticket...
the volatility argument is stupid.  what would you expect from a nascent new form of money with so much potential?  ultimately, the price is going MUCH higher.  this is where my experience as a stock trader came in handy.  volatility is NORMAL for success.  stocks don't go from an IPO value of $1 to $800 in a straight line.  it zigzags around like a stuck pig.  the bull tries to buck you off at every opportunity.  it can't possibly take everyone up together with everyone making money.  most have to lose on the way up.  likewise, there will be only a few billionaires made from Bitcoin who hold to those higher levels.  and here we have solved another argument against Bitcoin: that against hoarding.  hoarders will sell all the way up at different points of the bull.  after all, all of us have different opinions as to where it will top out.  that's what make even us bulls different human beings.  thus, hoarding is NOT a problem.  the coins will be distributed over time.
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:33:26
very poor implementation of logic.
altcoins are not copies of the Bitcoin protocol.  ALL of them have changed either the protocol or the economic foundations upon which Bitcoin is based in some manner some large some small.  the analogy would be like changing the message of a hash function in a slight way resulting in an entirely *different* digest.  
furthermore, the proof is in the results; altcoin values and size are miniscule to that of Bitcoin despite the dozens upon dozens of attempts to create something with similar success.
thus, we can conclude that not only does Bitcoin have first mover advantage and is clearly demonstrating a network effect, but it also is a completely different and unique protocol which sets it head and shoulders above all altcoins.

Kashmir did an excellent moderating.
Chris Larsen did very well altho he's clearly trying to jumpstart Ripple off the back of Bitcoin.  Unfortunately, the entire Ripple project underestimates the importance of POW.  POW allows any small individual miner to get in on the groundfloor of the BTC issuance and provides a financial incentive to bootstrap a fledgling currency.  This is missing in Ripple.

you cannot separate the bitcoin currency unit from the bitcoin protocol.  they go hand in hand.  one is worthless w/o the other.  now, you will say that the protocol w/o the currency unit could be used for other things like smart contracts or whatever.  but this would be wrong.  why?  it's b/c the currency units happen to be what is traded for value or money in the Bitcoin Network.  the protocol would be worthless w/o the marketplace placing a value on the currency units.  why again you say?  b/c you have to incentivize the miners to provide security and verify tx's otherwise they wouldn't do it. in other words they have to be paid.  the other strong motivating factor here is the fixed supply of these units.  miners believe that the BTC they get paid will go further up in value with time thus motivating them even more to get a hold of BTC.  thus security and liquidity is facilitated by the currency units themselves.
tldr:  the currency units are inseparable from the protocol and are a critical part of measuring, incentivizing and growing value in the system as a whole.

i think 99% of the ppl involved in Bitcoin are doing so precisely b/c they don't have to be on anyones greenlist.  b/c most of these ppl own small businesses, they are unlikely to participate especially since Bitcoin enables the creation of many new small businesses.  
the only businesses that have a vested interest to protect or are fearful of not participating in greenlists are large businesses that are already entrenched in the USD based fiat system.  but Bitcoin was never about them to begin with.  it's the People's Money, which by definition is small business.

i wish them the best of luck altho it seems like they won't need it.  years ago, i wasn't too keen on the scheme but now i can definitely see a need for this.  these things will spread the use of BTC far and wide.  it's like a distributed network for the exchanges.

the banks are either:
1.  hoarding the free money as excess reserves upon which they make a risk free return of 0.25%.  this has discouraged lending.
2.  speculate on commodities driving up gas and food prices
3.  speculate on stocks driving P/E ratios to overvalued levels ensuring another bust.

no, it's a fact that most of the major Wall St banks benefitted from direct bailout money printed up and disseminated directly into their coffers to remove bad loans from their books.  not to mention $21B in loan guarantees extended by the American ppl.  it has nothing to do with your fancy distractions of "neoliberalism or labor vs. capital".  not one of those guys went to prison for all the damage they inflicted on our economy and system.
poor ppl would benefit from the fact that the limited savings they have will gain in purchasing value.  they can't afford to buy stocks or assets that an inflationary system encourages.

While the content has been excellent, I would have preferred to have the topics more philosophically challenging like :
1.  Why was bitcoin invented? 
2.  Is bitcoin better than gold? 
3.  How many millions would it take to cause that exponential hashrate growth?  
4.  Can governments stop bitcoin? 
5.  What's this about The People's Money? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:10:49
you keep talking like all govt's round the world are going to act as one large oppressive, monolithic force to crush Bitcoin.  in case you hadn't noticed, that is not what is happening.  and it won't happen as long as govt's like the US won't return gold to Germany's vaults on demand but instead insist on a 7 yr payback plan while at the same time, refusing audits of their supply.
which is why Germany has deemed Bitcoin a perfectly legal private currency and many other countries are allowing it to grow.  even more broadly, govt's represent a small fraction of those owning computers worldwide and those computers are hosting copies of the blockchain which is all that is needed for Bitcoin to survive if not flourish.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:47:22

@_date: 2013-10-16 17:55:36
forgive me for my ignorance.
i'm assuming we're talking about the use case of using ECDSA private keys to sign BTC tx's here.  
if you're paying out BTC continuously from the same address, as is done in Mycelium, the private key to that address is constant.  won't hashing that private key create the same nonce over and over again for different tx's?

what do you expect when the US refuses to give back your gold?
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:45:18
What you really mean is pruning. 
Checkpointing is going on now but doesn't speed anything up since the client still has to scan the entire chain on download and doesn't alleviate space requirements. All it does is cement all the blocks in prior to the checkpoint. 
Pruning on the other hand as has  been proposed will actually remove all of blocks prior to a certain point and then work off the UTXO set which will speed initial download and decrease space requirements.

Germany previously said that Bitcoin could be used as a "private" currency.  furthermore, they said they would not charge capital gains on BTC after one year.
THIS, however, is new news!  and incredibly exciting.  Bitcoin as legal tender basically makes it public currency to settle ones debts and pay taxes with.  it probably means that the rest of Europe follows suit when the central powerhouse of the EU is using Bitcoin.
it basically means one can live their whole life on BTC if one chooses.

So so true. 
The cost of money printing is rising.

Hmm, this was my thought as well. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 17:22:21
that was cool.
i'm amazed at how open vendors were to accepting BTC :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:26:45
it's possible that the 70x use factor was always there but the price stayed too speculatively low.  no one knows.
however, i had been arguing for months since the Spring that the parabolically rising hashrate was a forward indicator of what the price *should* have been doing.  millions were being invested in ASIC mining gear w/o much if any going into the purchase of BTC.
i argued for a "snap UP".  well, we got it.  and in a likewise parabolic way.

would iteration = transaction in the case of a BTC tx?
@_date: 2013-01-12 22:53:43
i've done it this way in the past, but i had to download the blockchain.  is that not necessary now?

my thoughts too.
@_date: 2013-02-18 13:55:26
i think we can all agree that the entity we are talking about here would be either a gov't or banking institution that theoretically has unlimited funds to attack Bitcoin.  they don't but that's how the theory goes.
in that light, RISK plays a much more dangerous element in performing a 51% attack.  not monetarily b/c of the unlimited funds but politically and technically. 
first of all, its highly unlikely they would succeed.  i contend that its quite possible that enthusiasts would rally to increase their mining activities in an attempt to protect the network and possibly their current investments as opposed to the fleeing of mining that many have theorized.  much like how torrent sites have proliferated despite gov't/industry pressure.  after all, there are thousands of us and only one of them.
secondly, risking the large sum of money to build a server farm for the attack is not trivial anymore with the increased scrutiny of gov't budgets.  its quite possible that the building of such a facility would leak and drive up the costs of say ASIC equipment to exceedingly high levels and make it much more expensive than surface calculations.  whereas honest miners can add to the network security incrementally, a hostile entity has to make a huge investment all at once and the result will be binary; either success or outright failure.  which is a highly risky scenario and from a game theory standpoint not cost effective as they will likely get just one chance.
thirdly, the political costs of failing will make them think beforehand about even trying an attack.  the fallout of a failed attack would be an enormous hit to the credibility and financial health of any entity that tries this.  even non-Bitcoiners would start asking questions about why gov't or shareholder money was being used to try and achieve such a thing?  "Bitcoin must be really a good thing if they fear it so much". "maybe we should check it out".  "what a bunch of idiots for failing".
fourthly, from a technical standpoint, Gavin has already outlined the defensive steps the network can easily take to shut such an attack down.  it actually sounds trivial.

do you see any advantages to Electrum over Armory. i actually think Armory is more secure from a purely theoretical POV since it doesn't touch any servers.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:08:53
very positive.  it means that the fiat will eventually move back into Bitcoin, not run away.

yep, that was the best part.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:22:04
mining is meant to replace the entire banking system along with its infrastructure: corruption, bailouts, payoffs, employees, buildings, bonuses, desks, chairs, paper, pens, bathrooms, teller booths, vaults, armored trucks, etc.
that's why its developed to the size it has.  plus its transparent.
@_date: 2013-01-28 02:39:14
fantastic!  how'd you get them to sell it?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:25:29
i think it would only be good for Bitcoin.
the more invested participants in the system, whether it be individuals or big corporates, will strengthen the network against attacks of any kind from non-economic actors.

@_date: 2013-09-10 16:27:11
this is a very good question.
i was listening to an EconTalk podcast this weekend whereby the presenter was quoting the works of Hayek vs Keynes.  turns out, Hayek was in favor of limited regulation of free markets according to this presenter.  Keynes made a very good point in saying that once you move one inch away from a totally free market ideal towards limited regulation, you're trapped in attempting to define what that is and how far it goes.
not an easy question as i do believe we need gov't for certain types of public services.  but then you could argue you're favoring the workers in those industries.

yes as well as the intrinsic value of the network itself that is composed of all the computers, software, electricity consumption, USD invested, ideas and manpower to maintain.
and it's growing parabolically.
