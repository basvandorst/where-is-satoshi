Yeah good point. It's not like he's going to sell all the albums at once. It's going to be spread out over the days.

That's sad to hear, I had to contact coinbase in the past (probably 6 months ago or more) about missing coins and got a reply within hours and the issue was resolved the same day. Sounds like they've grown too big to provide adequate support.

So a tax because it gets spread out in the form of inflation?
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:37:09
That's good to hear. It also says something when you're here posting on Reddit.
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:36:20
Are you kidding, the Fed can just print out more money.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:07:36
I have to agree. You can't just blatantly say that xxx amount of data is good for you, obviously it depends on the person.

That's a clean looking car man.. The dark rims and black trim makes it look sharp.

Whether it's stock or not, I'd seriously consider that color if I could afford one.

It's just so dang new nobody knows what it'll do. I have an optimistic outlook on the bits of the coin though. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:49:57
So as of now that is 0.08079 USD.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:14:18
Seems kind of low, will you do £100?
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:52:27
So was it like coinibase.com or something real close to regular coinbase?
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:20:12
Sounds like a win win for you. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:16:32
If you looked at the full header would you be able to see another domain somewhere?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:27:36
Gotta love that chicken teriyaki.

I don't understand your comment. All I did was say what the value of that BTC was in USD at the moment I posted it. I'm not making any statement about Bitcoin being stable or not.

There's got to be a few in their later years who are good with technology just like a lot of us younger people. He said he got on AOL right when it started, so he's probably been using the internet longer than most of us. Just saying..
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:18:01
Gotcha that makes sense. Hopefully the person didn't get in trouble. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:36:36
Everyone does.. obviously. If only we had a time machine (would be the easiest if you could go back in time and invest in something scenario).
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:39:59
I sent 2 and changed the transaction fee to 0 yesterday and they went through fine. Not sure what the deal is for you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:57:17
Ah good times.. potentially.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:24:58
It was yesterday that I got that reply.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:48:56
I'm disappointed that Filezilla still uses SourceForge and defaults to having you download that stupid installer crap along with Filezilla. Sure you can get a direct link to the installer, but by default it makes you get this additional software that includes adware. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:08:22
So I take it they can't just link it to their bank account and convert it to cash like we can with something like coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:56:36
I too am lucky and have the app, the downside is that there won't be any updates until Apple allows the app again.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:11:59
Any kind of specific purchase in mind or that's just the plan?
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:15:36
If it's that simple why did the let the app on the app store in the first place?
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:01:41
Yeah obviously he wasn't worried about losing ~88 cents worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:49:38
I just checked and it allows me to buy now.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:58:27
How long does it take until you're at the point where you accept the transaction? Doesn't it take up to 30 minutes for the coins to be verified to have been received?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:37:56
If I were that fucker and sold them, I'd still have a pretty good chunk of the 750K.. I'd invest a lot of it in gold probably at this point. Some of it in bitcoin though of course. Nothing to commit suicide over though.

I actually emailed them asking about the .1 minimum the other day and here's the response I got:

Nice graph, is it a website?
