You're still quoting a CEO of a multi billion dollar corporation and relishing the appreciation for a product that you have a very strong bias towards. A corporation which, while not as corrupt as some are, is still abusive and authoritative to consumers.
In that sense alone, this post is disgusting, not to mention that you're just circle jerking for karma uncreatively.

And his blatant disregard of the question to instead insult the dollar.
If we assume that man on the left was actually asking about the feasibility of bitcoin and how it works. Then this bald guy's response comes off as extremely rude.

Wow, bald guy here is just a propaganda machine, he doesn't explain himself at all and just spouts "calculations". The reporter on the left is looking for legitimate answers and all this guy does is spout pompous remarks. That's not how you garner respect from outsiders, that's how alienate them. The report itself, if it can even be seen as a positive view for bitcoin, can only be seen as a positive from those already playing the game. Because this man just throws out meaningless statistics and no beneficial facts. The one thing I do like is his remark about diversifying, because he actually explains himself. He also does play devils advocate in that case, since he explains cryptos have insecurities, which is a good way of presenting things.
