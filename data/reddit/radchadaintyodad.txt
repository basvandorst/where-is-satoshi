Donating to Mast cell disorder research would be a great cause. Not too much research has been done, compared to other medical research, and the effect of mast cells on the body is huge and not fully researched. I’m a veteran and got sick during the Iraq war and after years of doctors it turned out I had developed a mast cell disorder (MCAS). It’s only gotten worse over the years and right now the only treatment is pills, and they’re not even the best at stabilizing the mast cell. I’ll forward this to some non profits doing research, it would be a great cause.

If there was a chance it is real I sure as fuck wouldn't post it on Reddit. If you lost 950 bitcoin I think you would be scouring everywhere since you lost 4 million. I'd go find that someone if it happened to me. Be careful....

That definitely says a lot too. The poor are poorer and the rich are richer.

Are digital wallets really that much safer than something like coinbase? Isn’t it a wallet also? 
Hardware wallet obviously can’t get digitally hacked without it in their possession.

How would they even know if you didn’t? Do sites like coinbase have to give 1099’s out? Otherwise I don’t see how the IRS would know.

I’ve assumed this for a while. And with Russia being all up on cyber warfare, I’m sure they’re mining coins and trading as well.
