I came up with a little algorithm to detect manipulation like you speak of. Basically the algorithm checks to see if there is a lot of activity around a coin. If there is activity it assigns it a score of being 90% certain it is due to bots and manipulation. That's pretty much the whole algorithm.

Yeah so for that case you assume all the insider trading already took place. Any gains from commoners buying on the news are mitigated by someone who had inside info selling to earn their profits.

Look up bitcoin wallets and do some reading. There a lot of different options with many tradeoffs between ease of use and security.
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:11:00
You can make a wallet without any ID. You just can't deposit money to your bank without it.

With how their economy is crumbling and massive inflation just caused them to  knock 3 zeros off their currency, I don't think it makes their cryptocurrency very trustworthy
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:46:01
This guy bitcoins

I don't think thats mountain dew in your cup

You really come off like a pompous ass and anyone who actually knows software or hardware engineering knows you are full of shit.

Lot of quantum computing experts and NSA insiders in the comments here. Very interesting!
@_date: 2018-05-19 03:28:31
5 years? I'm calling bs.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:26:18
IBM also said they had a general purpose question answering system called watson that turned out to be about 80% hype when my company paid millions for a proof of concept. The company is trying to create hype to get contracts. This article is pure click bait and you are rambling on and on about the NSA and snowden as if you actually know anything. All the while being a total dick to this other guy who is an actual engineer with experience and his head within reality. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:18:30
Haha yeah definitely. That said, though, it wouldn't need to be widely available. Even one computer could probably do it if the hype is real. But 5 years? No way
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:51:29
Irrelevant, rhetoric

Non millenials: "I read something on the internet that sounds dumb... all people 35 and under must be doing this thing every day and making it their entire identity. I'll post about it online"
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:26:42
It's messed up that mom and pop shops like these keep being put out of business by big conglomerates like amazon.
@_date: 2018-05-19 04:36:44
Yeah exactly. Someone mentioned the NSA. This is not something that springs up from complete isolation. This is a theoretical machine that is taking tons of research from all over the world. Why spread FUD like this?

Listen to each VPN connection? Not sure I follow.

Please do. Your comments are literally worthless drivel.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:53:48
Just block me man I don't care. Your comments are ill informed and you sound like a pompous jerk.
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:21:39
Especially when you can barely ever use it to buy actual goods.

Seems like they held value in a more stable and predictable way this past year.

I just read a comment on this very post that said hyperinflation of fiat is inevitable. The reasoning was that "As it inflates, it speeds up... duh..."
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:37:45
Thanks for taking one for the team, sincerely!

I stopped reading at magic sponge soaking up water. At ten years old I guarantee that kid can understand more than that
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:02:00
I have a kid and I'm fine financially. What is it with reddit being so worried about the cost of a kid? For people who act like they want to be happy, they are so quick to ditch one of the most rewarding aspects of life to save a few bucks. You seem obsessed with money when you say stuff like that. 
But here is some more tips to save money: never date, have friends or take up a hobby. You should be all set if you do those things as well.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:37:04
Aaaannnnd I'm the worst human on earth
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:26:17
But fiat would lose 66% in 30 or so years! See? It was a great buy! /s
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:25:25
Hyper inflation is not at all imminent. Inflation, sure. Hyperinflation? What are you smoking.
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:34:36
Hmm. At first I thought they were dumb. But when I think of it, so far I actually have been buying high and selling low. These guys are just trying to help idiots like me, I guess.
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:38:37
I'll tell you i spent 1k on bitcoin when it was at 16k or so and ive got whats now pennies on the dollar. I'm not asking whats in your bank lol. You are interesting
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:29:04
Wow, props to the Binance team! This wasn't a hack on their system but an attack on the individual users who were compromised from phishing attacks. Binance really had those users' backs on this one.

Whatever he meant it isn't how it works. There's no free 2,000 dollar loophole.
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:14:08
A very well explained argument! Keep hoddling that trash for a century while this brilliant plan unfolds.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:43:38
I have 1 bitcoin worth 6k. I sell that for 6k and enter a short on bitcoin saying I will buy 1 bitcoin in one month. The price goes to 4k and I buy the bitcoin and make 2k. If the price went up to 999k, i just bought a coin at 999k and my life is fucked.
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:32:44
If you made a killing then why would you work a side job to buy more of it when the market has been shit for months?
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:49:08
You should look more into it because you are missing key aspects of it. It is an agreement to either buy or sell at a future date.
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:36:12
You don't know if you made a couple grand?
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:46:16
lol alright fair enough ill shut up now
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:42:40
Uh you are laughing and thats not even what i said. You must hear it so much you think any sentence is that or something. My comment was that you literally did not even remotely answer the guys question.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:55:38
Yeah get right in there lol
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:44:14
Do you annoy yourself if you ever read back your own comments?
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:11:03
Seems reasonable
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:34:43
So you made a couple grand?
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:17:19
Yeeeeaaahhh..... you made a killing I'm sure. I was more talking about your detailed century long plan, not whether or not this coin is officially dead or not.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:28:29
Why would you make 2000 regardless of if the price goes up or down?
@_date: 2018-03-17 04:06:32
I was wondering the same.
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:47:24
The other scenario is going long. I have 1 bitcoin worth 6k. I enter a long saying I wjll sell one coin in 1 month. The price goes to 1k in a monfh and now im forced to sell my coin for a 5k loss. If the price went to 999k i sell my coin for 999k and retire.
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:14:11
Haha you're talking about overthrowing all of the governments on the planet and installing some decentralized thing... which sounds more like a global centralized government.
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:58:37
Settle down there, Lenin.
@_date: 2018-07-07 21:30:18
and really dumb
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:22:20
So the people all vote and then what? Some authority upholds the decision... a ... central authority? I'm genuinely just wondering how a decentralized legal system would work.
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:17:27
A decentralized thing making decisions for the whole planet... it sounds like a central thing to me. Maybe you could explain what you had in mind?
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:33:51
I guess you are just losing me with the word decentralized. If the entire planet starts enforcing one globally accepted set of rules, would that not be a centralized global government? With money it makes sense, but a decentralized legal system? The words don't make sense dude.
@_date: 2018-07-05 03:11:05
I meant Vladimir Lenin
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:47:54
Well you seem like you at least think ur really smart, maybe you should go for it. Most people would be fucked if they did it, but there is always that example of the dude who dropped out of college and somehow got rich. Maybe you are that guy. Or maybe you are an idiot who is looking for validation from strangers online for some made up scenario even though you claim you are so smart that you pay out the ass for college and don't even go to class cause you think you know it all anyway. I'd be curious to read a follow up post whilst taking a dump sometime to hear how it turned out.
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:13:41

Did you ever go to class? Cause this is the dumbest financial decision I've seen on this sub lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:07:50
Yeah these crypto people get into anarchy big time. Sure, it might not be the most efficient system, but I think we have it pretty sweet in general. Roads, power, protection, a justice system, social safety net, etc. When I think about the services I get for my tax money it actually seems to go really far.

Dear god. Why not just own it? If you made a bad investment get over it. No need to avoid anything unless you really messed up that bad to where one question brings back such horrible memories. It just comes off 10x more pathetic.
