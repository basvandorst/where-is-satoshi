Coinbase irritates me often, but where else can I get my USD directly into coin? I'm a relative noob, so sorry if this is a dumb question.

Who do you recommend if you don't want to pay Coinbase's absurd fees?

If you're still looking for donation targets, I think YouTube's *Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell* is a worthy recipient. They do awesome educational animated shorts that explain things to people in ways they can more easily understand. An example
