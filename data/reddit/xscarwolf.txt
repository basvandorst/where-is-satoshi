 is for you then. I believe GoButler was there before Magic. It was founded in germany, by the german comedian Joko Winterscheidt aswell as some other germans and does exactly the same thing. And the best? It's available in Canada and some other countries. It also uses Braintree, a PayPal Company as a payment processor, they accept Bitcoin, PayPal, Apple Pay, Android Pay and a lot more. Honestly I never used it as it is not available in my country but it's featured on german TV and has received some nice reviews, so can absolutely trust it.

Referring to that chart, Imaging you would have trusted bitcoin earlier and bought some thousands when they were as low as $0,01 and sold them for $1,1k each... You would be rich. But maybe that what it is like with a bourse. You can't be sure what will happen in the future.

Alright, that's plausible. Another question: Should I really trust CoinBase? I used MultiBit because it was easy and have the control over my BitCoins. I know many poeple are using CoinBase but looking at the past told me that a lot of Online Wallets "suddenly disappeared" leaving the BTC owners in the dark. I thought about changing to something else than MultiBit because I also want to have the control of my BTC using an Android App, but as said, I have my thoughts on using online wallets...

I only have a local wallet using MultiBit yet.
So there isn't any profitable method for getting bitcoins? I don't get what's the deal with bitcoins then. I always thought bitcoin is getting more famous because of poeple having the ability to pay with money "they got by investing nothing".

Envy isn't nice.
