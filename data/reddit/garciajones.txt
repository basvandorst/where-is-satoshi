Oh ok so wait , this app isn’t truly owning bitcoin ? For the life of me I can’t link my bank account ; it keeps asking me if I opened my bank account in northern or Southern California and both answers keep coming back incorrect. 
Hypothetically if it grows and I double or trip such a small amount , to the point I wanna use some to buy something how do I get it into my bank account ? Sorry if I’m asking the wrong questions, but definitely love all the advice and understandings from you guys

The profit that you’ll make eventually; the ability to purchase and make your mom spaghetti.

I'm literally brand new to this. I was going to sign up for Coinbase. I saw I could buy part of one bitcoin. Is it like the stock market ? I'm not trying to get rich quick and I love the idea behind bitcoin ( I've been doing a ton of research ) but could I purchase maybe like 50 bucks and sell it if it grows ? 
I'll check the side bar but I just wanted to ask since your comment really had me high spirits about learning more . 
Edit : somehow wrote trying twice when I meant to say NOT trying to get rich quick. Damn mobile.
