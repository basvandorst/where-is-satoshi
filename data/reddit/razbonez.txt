@_date: 2018-01-13 22:35:59
Im usa based. I read it said bitpay will continue uninterrupted for usa customers. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:34:43
I just went to atm and withdrew cash no problem. Its just the btc wallet part. Should i be worried? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:31:40
I just used it 2 days ago? 
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:19:37

"global footprint"������ you belong in r/pos
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:33:25
*they" don't. The fed buys them. This isn't 1940 bro
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:11:33
It might be what it is but it doesn't make it sustainable.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:01:37
Oh so I can HV a liberal guy Tell me like he told you that debt is good for the economy...ok bro
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:26:45
Dude. Really. Sell ur BTC and go back to r/hilaryclinton
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:02:45
No. There's healthy debt and unhealthy debt. Give debt is unhealthy. Private business debt, as long as they HV a reasonable plan to pay back debt is healthy
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:12:12
It's covered in shit though right?
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:14:12
Upvotes just mean you got more sheep on your side bro...which on this thread of ppl who have no idea which BTC is the real one doesn't say much.��
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:58:08
Yeh basically theft. None of those things are actually "created"
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:02:54
Why would anyone buy tbills right now or the last 15 years. Less than 0% return.
@_date: 2018-10-29 22:00:35
Except, when you expect ppl to continue to "pay" for stuff they never agreed to pay for 
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:19:25
Governments can run out of money, if ppl stop funding them.
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:26:54
Dude. Really. Sell ur BTC and go back to r/hilaryclinton
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:20:18
Uh cuz crypto doesn't HV anything to do with the government. They don't even like crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:19:20
No, that's what youve been TOLD. No rules aren't any different. Being 30trillion in debt, excluding unfunded liabilities, when over 60% of the jobs are in the public sector is not smart no matter how you spin it. And no, public debt is not private savings Mr. Doublespeak
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:59:21
Yeah it's a belief that spending 108% is not healthy for any economy, macro or micro.
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:35:25
No they are not. Debt to gdp has been higher, but for a much shorter period, there were way more private sector jobs at the time producing way more value. It's unsustainable bro
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:18:59
Yeah ok. The really wealthy hate making money. Idiot statement number 20 you've made
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:18:11
There's responsible debt and irresponsible debt. One is you plan on paying it back and HV a reasonable plan on how to do it. The other is fuck it, yolo, the government recklessly spends spends spends, on shit we don't need and then EXPECTS, us to foot the bill. 2 completely different things bruh
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:01:03
You sound like you have a good deal of funds. Why not invest in physical gold,  platinum and silver to reduce some of your massive amount of funds,  then continue to keep rest of funds in your bank and continue to buy bitcoin from it? Do you own a bitpay card? Because you could use your bitcoin as cash too from there? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:32:00
Read fooled by randomness. Explains this in detail
@_date: 2018-10-31 21:02:03
Fear-mongering. Your a fucking moron. Sell your BTC and buy t bills dumb ass
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:10:59
No it's most definitely not incorrect. Going 30 trillion in debt, where 60% of our economy is made up of private jobs is not sustainable. Enjoy your University economics education.
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:12:28
I understand where THE currency cones from but it still doesn't make it correct. I think you mistook this sub for r/liberaleconomics  
@_date: 2018-10-29 21:56:33
No you can't. That's what they tell you they spend it on.
@_date: 2019-03-05 14:26:09
I used to buy cigs with my parents silver dollars n dimes
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:13:57
FYI the gov buys the tbills. I don't.
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:40:49
Lol. Your taxes don't pay for infrastructure. Your taxes merely covers debt payments. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:13:23
Spending 108% gdp is not a good thing. It doesn't take a functionally poor college econ degree to figure that out bruh
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:10:43
"pressure" fuck tha gov.
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:05:47
Use bitpay. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:15:40
How else gov get revenue besides theft, I mean taxes? Oh wait you mean more theft via tickets, and confiscation?
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:17:48
They just raise fees and pass the fines off to the consumers they screwed in the first place. Buy BTC.
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:00:58
Ah. Perfect. I hv plenty of btc... Just like to be able to get cash every once in a while! 
@_date: 2016-12-07 15:42:15
So we can no longer send bitcoin to circle, change it to usd and deposit that in our banks? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:24:22
Wouldnt they outlaw your funds in the bank or keep you from accessing them before any of those things happen. And wouldnt outlawing gold and btc make it worth more not less? Guess if thats your thinking though you should buy a shit ton of guns. Those will always go up in value. Guns and bullets.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:43:05
"we" didnt create anything for defensive purposes. Thats a fairy tale people have bought into for the formation of states. States are about power homey. Period.

Whyd you have an HSBC acct to begin with����
@_date: 2017-04-25 02:23:03
Heres how i look at it: all these people who say debt is good, are BEING TAUGHT DEBT IS GOOD. so through wordplay, banking analogies, and keynesian wizardry, theres been a surge in debt mathematics. What i dont understand is that it was misallocation of resources that led to most recent economic dowmturn, where peoples debt exploded on housing... So how since then have countries gone into astronomic debt since then? 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:16:09
Youre an idiot if you really think this is how it was and is. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 17:56:50
Yay!!! Hardest thing ln reddit, is guessing what someone meant!! Thx for clarification!! The thing most dont understand about revolutionary war wasnt that americans didn't like taxes... They just didnt like taxes to britain!

Wen is cnbc gonna do forth memes now?
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:35:53
I think the general public is included. They're the dumbasses who voted for treasury bills.
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:10:20
Dude. Ethics? Guy is dead dude. What is this question? Are you like a Reddit addict where you can't make a decision before you ask the "community?" Can you access the Bitcoin. It's yours. Quit being a bitch and live a little.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:37:16
I take major loans out, sell my business, whore my gf out, sell my cars, liquidate everything if btc gets NEAR 1000.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:29:37
Buy buy buy. Id be trading my gf on margin. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:54:44
No, seriously, if btc got near 1000, i would LITERALLY get money from other guys to do with her as they pleased, then take that money and buy btc. I dont care what you do with your possessions , dont worry about how i use mine.
