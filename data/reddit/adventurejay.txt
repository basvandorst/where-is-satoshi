Hello Mentors.  I am a new minor with a clean helmet and shiny headlamp.  I use Exodus and am wondering what exchange I should use.  I am based out of California and would like to stay as anonymous as possible, cause robots.

Just think, when the internet was ten years old the Dot Com bubble had only just begun, now most of the planet has it in their pocket.  Now imagine what the next ten years holds for Block Chain. HODL.

Are there any more BITCOINS left to mine?  Is it worth it to invest in mining hardware?
