Still saying the same thing. I guess it wasn't ment to be
@_date: 2017-03-14 02:04:37

@_date: 2017-03-31 20:52:04

Tryed that and I keep getting an assertion failed  every time I open it.
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:03:59
Or they are trying to play the best of both worlds
@_date: 2019-11-24 08:23:00
Should of wrote send bitcoin and you would be able to keep it
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:21:32
Still won't work
@_date: 2019-11-24 09:13:59
If only I actually wrote this
@_date: 2019-03-14 00:01:43
Nice! I too can lay two pennies in the street. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 16:44:50
Let's rob this fool
@_date: 2019-11-13 18:00:58
Even tells you how this is going to go in the picture
@_date: 2019-11-07 22:26:59
Places like coin base will replace them
@_date: 2018-10-22 10:12:50
Yea right.  Alot more people know about bitcoin than ever. The last pump we had was to get everyones attention.
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:59:35
@_date: 2019-08-21 02:00:33
Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice.
@_date: 2019-08-18 18:32:46
I can dig it
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:56:06
If you see em point em out
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:03:43
Litecoin is in a way more decentralized than bitcoin.....
@_date: 2019-10-22 21:52:12
Imo mimblewimble will help make ltc more globally accessible because you will have a form of privacy (but not to private).Unlike Facebook's coin where the government was saying is it's not private enough. So ltc should be looking like a diamond in the dirt.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:39:28
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:23:30
I don't know why more people are not talking about this.
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:42:59
It you want to look at the all time chart we're up 53,000% if that makes you better. Still the best performing asset in the world.
@_date: 2019-12-25 07:06:30
It's not for everyone
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:46:59
What happens if you have coins in litcoin and bitcoin and they merge together?
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:23:28
Is there anyway I can re-download or resync the blockchain?
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:09:49
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:50:45
4 hours later...POP!
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:17:28
Just being curious...
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:05:43
Bitcoin was already acting a fool when he did this.  But i still laugh everytime i see this.
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:11:04
Use litecoin especially after this update where fees are going to be next to nothing. 
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:16:25
So they will mine all the coins in 30 minutes nice
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:18:22
Wow lighten up
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:16:02
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:30:22
Stock market....
@_date: 2019-09-11 06:13:56
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:43:22
Just go to litecoin if shit hits the fan.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:58:17
I have a keepkey and never had a problem with it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:29:46
You do know you can buy litecoin from coinbase, no need to send btc to polo.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:24:26
Convert it to litecoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:31:19
Bitches and blow
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:46:55
You do live in the US right? 
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:45:51
I'm making my own for $120
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:48:20
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:51:45
I already have a bunch of Ltc. Just want the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:47:04
Litecoin is still doing it's thing...
@_date: 2017-06-08 03:27:01
Segwit and larger block size could be years from now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:28:23
I was thinking about putting half of my BTC into litecoin in July. Seems like the best option. (Knocks on wood)
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:05:58
So should I pack up my BTC and head over to litecoin?
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:53:40
Litecoin already has what bitcoin wants. Less drama, faster transactions, bigger blocks just do your research. don't get stuck to something because of the name.
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:52:44
Did you use BTC pay?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:58:26
What's so good about vertcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:08:46
When did bitcoin fork?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:02:55
That's what I'm thinking about doing.
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:36:44
I heard litecoin is a slut that cooks and cleans.
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:17:15
I like this idea! Keeping your coins on an exchange goes against what crypto stands for. Might as well keep your money in a bank if your going to keep it on an exchange.
