I have a file called bitcoin.dat that I don't remember what was. I found it on an external drive I used some years ago. I'm thinking it could either be a wallet (that I maybe don't remember the passord for) or a keyfile for a wallet. Or some encrypted container I decided to name bitcoin.dat. Any tips on how I can check what it contains would be helpful.
I tried opening it as a wallet in electrum, but that crashed the software.

I finally managed to get into my account from 2013. The suspense. It had btc equivalent to 0.001 dollar. ��

That has nothing to with taxes.

What countries violently punishes their citizens for not paying their taxes? Most just take away their freedom?

Was excited, but then I read that I can't choose custom transfer fees.

I had heard of this lawsuit and thought it was too stupid, until I saw the movie Hot Coffee and learned what this was really about. Seeing the pictures of that poor old lady changed my mindset completely about the lawsuit. And hopefully also changed how I perceived Americans in regard to suing.

I had 0.5 BTC back in the day. Sold it for about 300 USD.
