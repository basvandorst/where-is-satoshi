I've been around Doge long enough that you guys are a depressing bunch.

Pardon me for trying to boost morale, Buzz Killington.

No, your currency becomes worthless.

I meant doge. I was trying to tip back, but no verification.

Very good response. Texas will love you. I have a ton more questions if you're ever bored and want to discuss politics, but this isn't the place considering I'm a resident of a different state.

Congrats! You win all the imaginary internet points!

A realistic look would say that capital flow increased the value of your holdings.
ETA: I'm prodding in good humor.

There is still no evidence that the FSM doesn't exist.

It's a trap!

We can't keep seeing each other like this.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:18:09
What, if any, limits do you support on the 2a?
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:34:41
Apples to oranges, sir. Do you know what happens if we all keep our wallets in our pocket?
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:06:43
It is granted.

Warm bags of sand.

I think sourcing is the biggest issue at the moment. Buying BTC is entirely too complicated for the average person.
