Probably because they do not understand that inflation is measured in baskets and not value of currency.  The rubel lost 30% over the last year compared to the us dollar, for a customer the inflation however was only 8.5% due to the majority of goods not being traded in USD.  As such if you had a Russian bank account you probably had something like -20% compared to the USD.  If you would have held bitcoin in the same timeframe you would have lost more than 50%.

Stripe was the first PCIDSS payment provider without iframes.  There is a very clear definition on what this is.  PayPal and Google are not.  Just because you punch a credit card into a form of a web service and someone charges it money does not mean that you are interfacing with a payment provider.
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:46:27


That's completely wrong on more than one level.  First of all the NFC protocol allows the NFC provider to add additional releases.  Most cards will auto accept N transactions in a row before a PIN is entered.  You could also implement other systems, from the protocol POV that's irrelevant.
Secondly NFC does not remove the PIN on normal cards.  The maximum damage you can for instance do on my Austrian cards is 75EUR, after which the card will lock until you enter the PIN.

Inflation is measured not just by governments but also independently.  In fact I'm pretty sure most inflation measurements are not done by governments, at least in Europe.  Why? Because too many people depend on a reliable measurement of that information and you don't just leave it to one entity.


You will be at a loss at no matter which point in the last year you bought bitcoin.


This is a ridiculous example and you know it.  When you have few transactions, few users, low mining costs you will see a very low value for a bitcoin.  That was the case for a long time.  Today is different and if you judge bitcoin at present day it's not a good investment.  The numbers thrown around here are baseless.


I'm surprised how you can think I am pro-Russian government based on my rejection of the concept of bitcoin as a good investment.  The whole topic was that Russians are fleeing to BTC.  My point is that if they are, they are not very intelligent as Bitcoin is neither a good investment nor safe from a regulatory point of view.
It's okay if you circlejerk around with fellow bitcoiners, but once you start pulling innocent people into this scheme it stops.  Build cool stuff with bitcoin, but don't advocate for it as an investment vehicle.

PayPal is not a payment gateway.  Why do you keep comparing it to Stripe?  They are not even remotely related to each other.


With a payment provider you transmit money from your account via a credit card to the merchant.  The risk is entirely the side of the merchant.  With PayPal the risk is on the side of PayPal and as such every part is subject to PayPal's fraud handling.  For a merchant it means that you cannot sell certain goods for instance and you are paying higher fees.
With a payment provider they are just handling credit cards for you and everything else is up to you.  (Chargebacks etc.).  There were various levels of PCI compliance for this.  Before Stripe the only way to get away with the lowest level of PCI compliance was by going through a payment gateway like global collect that host the checkout flow for you (typically in an iframe or a standalone page).  This is permitted under PCIDSS.  Stripe uses JavaScript to implement a fully customizable payout flow under PCIDSS rules that does not require either iframes or a separate page by passing encrypted tokens through the checkout page.
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:03:23


What do you mean by "official"? Inflation is independently measured.


The real inflation seems lower than that. source: friends and family in Russia.


Still more than if that person would have used bitcoin which is the whole point of the discussion.  However the vast majority of goods are either produced in Russia or China and are not particularly affected.  If you want European cars or make holidays in Europe it looks different for sure.  But most people do not do that anyways unless they are rich in which case the holiday is a small part o the overall expenditure.


If you would have held bitcoin the last year you would have lost more than 60%.  If you would have held bitcoin for 6 months you would have lost 30%.  Let alone that on any transaction you are mentioning (travelling, buying import goods) you undergo a currency conversion and lost even more.

First of all you can revoke the card with a call, my bank's website even has a button to instantly block it.  Secondly does it require a pin if the card is used to do too many NFC transactions in a row or if a transaction value goes above a value.  When I use my card to pay for more than 30 EUR it prompts for the pin.

At present bitcoin has zero cost transactions because the transactions are subsidized by miners.  However the the cost of running the network is real and if there were no block rewards currently, you would have to pay for transactions.  I don't think there is much debate about this.


Is that supposed to give the comment the necessary gravitas it otherwise lacks?
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:03:52
That's incredible misleading given that the bigger reward is in the mining than the transaction fee.  Once the inflation drops the transaction fees will have to go up given the cost of keeping the network running.

Not right now.  It sounds to me that while bitcoin might help companies start a money transmitting business, if they would become successful, bitcoin does not really play a role in that.  From a user of that remittance service bitcoin is an implementation detail so they are never exposed to it.  At no point would they even notice if that business stops transmitting bitcoin and instead transfers money in other ways.
I really do not see bitcoin as actually solving something for large companies there but maybe I'm missing something?

The problem with remittances is most likely a different one: the total flow of money is badly balanced.  For instance the amount of money WU sends to the Philippines is probably much higher than what flows out of it.  That can cause a wide range of problems.  For instance transferwise would have had issues bootstrapping as a remittance business even though they were very disruptive for international transfers.
I do not really buy that bitcoin helps there.  From looking at current bitcoin based remittance services they barely beat WU at all, and I am quite confident in saying that they beat WU largely because they are badly insured or are running at much lower profit margins.

@_date: 2015-01-17 05:50:07
I don't get why people say bitcoin fixes anything in remittances. The reason people use WU is because they get cash which requires a brick and mortar network and because the fees are locked in on transfer time. WU has that. If the recipient has a bank account there is no reason for WU there are many other services including your bank.
The transfer itself is free for WU, i don't see how bitcoin would help there. The fees for WU are used for all the things bitcoin remittance services would also have to pay for.

That's funny because I invoice people in the US constantly from the SEPA region, the numbers you posted are way higher than what even a regular commercial bank charges effectively.  But you could also use a service like transferwise which gives you much better rates or you can talk to your bank.  For instance if you wire USD a lot you can usually negotiate better rates or get a USD account.  The latter is just annoying for tax purposes.
However neither are related to why WU is interesting.  If you do bank to bank from US to Europe there is zero reason to use WU.

Because Visa and Mastercard are complying with anti money laundering laws.  They have to do everything in their power to prevent the transmission of illegitimate funds.


I did not say it was the only or dominant way, I said that Bitcoin makes a lot of sense for illegal transactions.


Yeah.  Gold deliveries as far as I know even need to be insured.


Depends on the act performed.  Generally yes, community needs to be taken to account for the actions of individuals in some cases.  This is for instance currently a heavily debated topic in Austria when it comes to the role of Islamic teachers on young adults going to fight for ISIS.

Paypal is an escrow service more than anything.  You can't even send certain payments through.  It's also neither decentralized now possible to interface with other than their merchant APIs.

With the exception of Tor and "cryptography" (which is really just a discipline) all of those systems have general ways for lawful interception to take place.  Tor is a topic which is for good reasons controversially discussed.


Everything can be used for evil, how much of that is then used for evil is a separate question.  If Flask for whatever reason would be 90% used for highly illegal operations then I think it would be valuable to look into why that is the case and adjust the system appropriately.  I doubt however that Flask is a particularly useful tool for this.
Not sure why you reject PyPI as an example here.  If PyPI would be  more decentralized the same rule would apply: the distribution of illegal content would be prevented as well as possible.  However I don't see PyPI ever decentralizing because that just causes more problems than it solves.
If I use my creditcard for illegal purposes and it has been established that I was the originator of that payment, then you can be pretty sure there will be legal fallouts as a result of that.  That is enabled by an identity being associated with my creditcard.


No, but every physical asset that is shipped around will be insured.  Not exactly sure what your point is.


That is quite irrelevant to the point I was making.  Obviously right now the acceptance of Bitcoin can be benefitial for certain businesses as you might attract a customer base that would otherwise not be interested in Bitcoin.  Overstock is most likely getting a lot of customers buying stuff for their bitcoin that they would otherwise not get, as you could just shop at Amazon.

Fundamentally nothing sets Ripple/Stellar apart from Bitcoin when it comes to the requirement of consensus.  The difference is that Ripple and Stellar are based on trust and Bitcoin is based on POW.
If you want to fuck Bitcoin over, you just need to buy some hashpower which might be easier to hide than collusion.

Depends on a few factors and at what point you want to attack the network and by how many mines there are.  It's in the high hundreds of millions of you want to do it buy buying hashing power directly.  If you just buy up mines you can get away with much less.


Do you have troubles reading?  I did not say it's broken, I said it is not broken because of external factors contributing to the healing process.


The exact same way as in bitcoin's case: a consensus by network participants.  The difference is that Stellar and Ripple accept that as a fact of live whereas Bitcoin pretends that this is not necessary.


I disagree.  The problems that Stellar has, Bitcoin also has.  The difference is that a failure to come to a consensus causes more damage to the Bitcoin network which is why there will always be more care taken to evolve it.

I don't buy this argument.  Technologies can support certain behavior and we know this because of what supports the blockchain.  There are incentives and those incentives keep the system secure.  This is a pretty accepted stance, even here in this very subreddit.  We can however from that also conclude, that different technologies can cause different behavior in humans.
Generally however if systems have a tendency to be used for criminal behavior, safeguards will be put in place to prevent this.  Bitcoin's hailed advantage here is that it does not have those safeguards.  So this sets it apart from other systems out there and in my opinion that's not an advantage.  It enables criminals to stay very safe in the Bitcoin environment and this does not help customers.
To bring the comparison back to Python: if someone would use the PyPI infrastructure to distribute illegal material you can bet your ass off, that this would be taken off as quickly as possible.


That's a bit unlikely given that you need to get building permissions to buy a house, so there will always be a record of a building (again, unless you are ignoring law :)).


Money transports today are generally insured and an insurance company will make a decision if recovery of goods is a good idea or not.


No, but I have a company so I'm exposed to what's easy to deal with and what is not.  Also not sure what you are arguing for here: that bitcoin is easy to have on books?  What supports that claim?
