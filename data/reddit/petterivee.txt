What do you mean with 10% inflation? We know Bitcoin has a limited resource to exhaust.
Proper inflation means that there is no limit for amount of currency in distribution.
If there would be non-regulated, non-govermental, non-private money both deflatory (limited supply) and inflatory (tx-based increase) currencies, a new world order of banking and people based money distribution can be uphold. It is all about trust. (like with current fiat currencies). You trust more your governance than your fellow neighbor?

deflatory currency, which easily leads to "herding"
Simply not true.
I'm not sure how do you defend current position of Bitcoin being "a traders goodie", than widely used as everyday currency of exchange. I would love to see Bitcoin being used outside the Cafe-concept.

I'm active on the sphere of betting. and concept of "wisdom of crowds" is widely used. Could it be the way for the Inflatory Currency of duality with Bitcoin?

Yes, for a while (what is the supposed year of completition?) but there is an underlying expectation of deflation existing throughout the "creation".

Almost close to Buddhism.
Honestly I don't know exactly what I'm suggesting. I guess no one ever tried this.
My main point is to grow trust among the people - democracy. Holding, hoarding, is not needed as we all understand that swift movement is more important than temporary gain of invidual.

The "magic of wisdom of crowds" is that it is not manipulated, because by nature people are manipulative

The fiat money of today, is based on giving loan via banks which are based on franctional reserve banking with private central banks.
Also not true.
Please enlighten me, as I'm only an amateur on these matters. How does fractional reserve banking work today?

Definitely if you say that merchants are adopting to Bitcoin or several hundreds of them are applying daily sounds good. What I'm seeing here in Nordic countries, it is not easy to exchange goods based on Bitcoin.
I'm happy of every single new entrepreneurship accepting new the coin.

I think you 2 are having very interesting discussion. But "illegalness" comes from trust of the people. Same as bankruns, same as accepting fiat money. TXs should not be dictated by banks but by people.
Do you know how long fractional reserve banking or having something on loan have been valid? ... long time, several generations. Is it the truth?

If deflation would really cause people to hoard, then everybody would already be hoarding and keeping their fiat in savings account drawing interest. Or hoarding gold or other things that keep value. It's just not what happens.
I disagree. This is happening. I come from Finland and I see this in practise on the market of selling apartments. Finland has been boosted by inflatory market for 2 decades now. It is not easy to sell at the moment, there is a bubble, so to say.
Deflation is happening due to lack of liquidity: old families, rich people have afford, normal people are out of the loop.
Suprisingly banks their results to be great on last 7 years by lending money.
It is payback time. People don't have affort.

Ask pinnaclesports.com they are constantly using this (and making money assisted by the best on the planet)

Good points.
Could we try "wisdom of crowds" for defining the rate of inflation, or is supposing too much trust to people? Technically I think it would be viable.
