I enjoy every post about someone pays in bitcoin for some services or goods, just like to watch how it expands.

Bitcoin is just the next stage of fiat money. Like it was with gold and other payment methods. The money has to evolve all the time, so we can solve existing problems and move forward.

problems you described are being solved at the moment with new technologies and innovations. People still cannot believe that it is possible to use crypto not only as investment

then we have stop screaming: "HODL" and start using crypto in our life + spreading correct knowledge about it

Actually, if this will be realized during the bull market or a stable one, it may cause a wider adoption. So this step may appear a core situation changer.

Nice, London is getting more and more crypto ads..
However, I am not sure whether it is something good or not.  
Do we like ads? But what if they are about crypto? I am confused.

don't wanna to destroy your illusions.. but they are even worse. Such people will thoughtlessly invest all money they have and blame you for losing everything

mining Bitcoin is not profitable anymore for individual miners. If you consider mining, you would better take a look at altcoins which are in their early stage

I and others would appreciate if you explain instead of simply claiming me to be wrong

Well, I am not about to argue, but your case is more exception to the rule. However, even if energy costs 0, there are a lot of other costs, such as Internet, Maintenance, rent, amortization and so on. You should remember that your own time also costs something as well as your computer/miner should be repaired/replaced sooner or later. Also if you have free space at your home/flat which you use to place your miners - you don't have to consider it as something free, but better imagine if you rent it to someone, or sell the energy from you solar batteries instead of using it for miners. I am just trying to say that you can get more profit from this resources.
TL;DR I agree, it could be profitable, but less then before and you need some special circumstances for this

I do like Ledger Nano. It is really great. However, I haven't tried TREZOR, so cannot be objective enough.
Choose what you like, they are not very different and both are very safe. Good luck
