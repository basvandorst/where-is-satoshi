u/lightcoin care to explain please?? Where is my FIAT currency held??? The Abra ToS literally don't mention the handling of customer fiat funds at all whatsoever. Not one line

Would you mind answering my question.
In what is now the third paragraph:


I just want to know what assurance Alice has that Abra will honor the hedge and settle her Ƀ0.01111111 at the time of withdrawal as stated there in FAQ. Because it currently appears to me that Alice has nothing other than a promise from Plutus Financial Inc, which is not even written anywhere in any FAQ or ToS/ToC.
Thank you

This is the part that I am interested in please. That bitcoin is held by Abra right now with no multisig, no smart contract, nothing whatsoever to cryptographically ensure that it will actually get sent to Alice when she withdraws. She has only a "promise to pay" from Plutus Financial Inc. Is this correct?
Also, this link is gone now?? 
edit: link back the next day with the truth appearing even more obscured
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:12:14
Doesn't this mean that if the Abra servers go down (or get hacked, destroyed, etc etc) that I lose access to my funds?? If this is not the case I would really appreciate a simple and clear explanation.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:19:39
Abra is a United States FinCEN registered MSB required to comply with full BSA regs, is this correct??
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:06:26
Abra is a United States MONEY TRANSMITTER conducting virtual currency business in every US state including New York and Hawaii, is that correct please?

They claimed they were launching full bitcoin support in February. I sent bitcoin to their "non custodial" wallet app and it's still locked in there. Actually, it's not even in there, because they spent my output on the first confirmation and gave me an abraUSD balance. No multisig anything, just straight P2PKH proving they have full control of my private key.
So what I really have is a totally unsecured IOU from a company with no licenses, no insurance, not even an MSB registration. I'm a New York state resident so I'm pretty sure that's violating at least 3 state and federal laws right there. Should I call the DFS? Lol
Does SynapsePay just do business with anyone nowadays? Or only if American Express is an investor

Thank you so much for the response, I really appreciate it. It looks like that zendesk post was written or updated shortly after my comment!
However, the "hedge" doesn't appear to make any sense in a non-custodial context.
"[Alice] will receive a deposit of Ƀ0.1 into her wallet, which will show up as $100 in her Abra wallet." What is not written is that Abra then removes this 0.1 bitcoin from Alice's wallet after the first confirmation, then sends it to Abra's own wallet. Is this correct?
Then, at the time of withdrawal, "Abra sends Alice Ƀ0.01111111". This is the real kicker... this extra bitcoin did not originate from Alice's wallet. Doesn't that clearly show Abra has sole custody of AT LEAST that Ƀ0.01111111? Which is to say, rather than bitcoin on her phone, doesn't Alice actually have nothing more than a promise from Plutus Financial, Inc. that they will send her bitcoin when she tries to withdraw??
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:19:49
They removed it... why??
edit: back. lol?

A very neat trick indeed!
Bill actually mentions CFDs in this Nasdaq piece from August: 
If anyone can provide a link to the American Banker podcast mentioned in the article, would be very interesting to hear more

^ so much this please.
The app is billed as a non custodial wallet, but when I deposited Bitcoin to it the output was immediately spent after the first confirmation and I was given abraUSD in return. I have no idea where those dollars are being kept, if their servers go down I have no apparent access to it, and to my knowledge they have no licenses or charters to hold my money in any jurisdiction.
And of course, no way to withdraw right now other than providing my banking information
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:45:46
Wait, what? No my output was literally spent, not by me, on the first confirmation. None of the addresses involved are multisig anywhere. So at the very least Abra has the private key as well. Do you want the TXID?
And, have you ever used the app? Can you tell me please where is the private key to my $10 balance it shows?? Obviously I have the 13 word mnemonic to the app itself, but that doesn't appear to have anything to do with the bitcoin blockchain.
I saw this post on your zendesk from "Rocky K":
 which said, "Users hold their own currency in their Abra wallet." I do see $10 on the screen, but my question is what happens when the abra servers go down, get hacked, get seized, whatever you like. If the number on my screen goes away then I don't understand how you can possibly claim it's a non custodial wallet

I was wondering the same thing. Lol. Must have something to do with usage of " symbol. Are there docs for Reddit markup somewhere?
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:23:05
I think you didn't read the post properly. Or maybe I wasn't clear. I meant Amazon support will clawback the USD from the account the gift card was loaded into.

Hey wait a minute. This situation is able to be resolved in a variety of ways. I would be interested to learn the Paxful username also if that's not against sub rules.
 If this user is really a high feedback account, his ads will be available any time to reopen your escrow and start a dispute on that trade. Simply message to mods that the dispute is actually regarding the previous trade ID
 Amazon gift cards are a highly reversible payment method, this is why the premiums are so high. All you need to do is live chat with a customer service agent while signed into your account and tell them your gift card was swindled. They will claw it right back out of the other account it was loaded into and put the balance on your own account. I've seen them do this recently even without having you send in the receipt and card rear images.
 Not only report this user to paxful but also start a thread on the paxful forum. Sellers do NOT like to see negative forum posts about them, especially high volume ones with constantly available ads. If it's not against sub rules you can post the forum link here as well.
There are many effective resolutions available to you in this situation, so don't be a victim. Bitcoin is about self-reliance and the community is here to help also. I recommend you do all 3 of these things and update here with the progress and results.
