lol Exactly.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:58:22
Or OP could be more explicit for those of us that aren’t up on the exact news. That’s all he’s saying. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:18:03
So goddamn true. Hail to the king. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:34:57
Your points are valid and this is still speculation. You are only proving my point. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:36:59
I second this. Crypto market cap overall IMO.

Wonder is Bitmain is testing those new S11’s...
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:06:33
They are resilient for sure but they scratch incredibly easy. That’s partially what makes them resilient. That commenter is right, this thing will lose its sheen very quickly.

Again, nobody is able to show any proof that Bitconnect does not have this trading bot. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:20:45
Basically, Bitconnect claims they own a bot that can make them a certain percentage of profit each day.  Those who support Bitconnect say that the bot is real, those who say it's a Ponzi say they don't actually have a bot.  Nobody seems to be able to offer anything other than conjecture on either side so YMMV.

I think they were being sarcastic.

What if I buy goods with BTC itself? Does the same principle apply to the dollar value of those goods?
Or what if, for instance, I sign a lease on an apartment and my landlord lets me pay in bitcoin. Can they somehow get taxes from me based on the rate of the rents value in btc?

My main question when topics like these come up is always:  how will they enforce this?
I don't mean that as a snide remark, I actually mean how can the government possibly do this from a logistical standpoint?
First I'm curious how it would be possible to even identify that I am the owner of a wallet, which is problem one.
Second, wouldn't they literally have to stand over me while I input my code to verify that I'm the owner and verify how much I own?
And third, if those two hurdles weren't enough, I could have 100 wallets with different amounts scattered all over the place.
I know things are different with software wallets potentially but I'd really like some of these questions answered and even more if I've missed anything important.

Student loans are a much safer debt to gamble against than all of this mortgage stuff going on.  
Personally, I am doing this right now in order to pay off my loans and feel good about the decision.  This is mostly because I know student loan repayment can be regulated to very low monthly payments based on my income should I not make enough money.
A loan with a fixed payment is much more dangerous and risky, and to some people [it's apparently worth it.](
Good luck to you.

I will admit that's how I started. As an older millennial I have to say that the reason I'm staying, however, is the potential this tech seems to have to completely turn the markets on their head. 
I said when Bernie got fucked that I hope Trump wins. Never in a million years would I want to be lead by this jackass, but I felt that the election of Trump would expose parts of our system and force a much faster change through his chaos. 
I feel similarly to Bitcoin. It may not be the best system, currently, to completely replace the ways in which we use money, but it's a start worth buying in to. If for no reason other than to give blockchain more exposure and start the process of finding the system that works. 
There's a notion in Buddhism that one way through suffering is to relate to it completely until revulsion forces you in a different direction.  I hope I'm seeing the seeds of this now. 
There will be a reckoning.

Could enough energy be stored during off peak hours in some advanced battery technology to feed the miners during peak hours?
I'm imagining a smart system that attempts to keep the power plants running at their efficient rate 100% of the time and adjust to stored energy when adjusts. I may not understand the amount of energy needed here but just spit balling. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:15:08
Oof.  I hope this is people who have already paid their homes and can afford the payments each month.  I'm a firm believer in BTC and cryptos in general, and moves like this feel dangerous and impulsive.  
I just hope they're in and out quick so they get the ROI before any serious regulations.

Skeptical of anyone titled "expert" in this space.  It's like calling a man lost at sea an "expert" of water.  Somehow the government is going to fuck it all up in the name of "safety".

I'm not so sure.  I've listened to his thoughts on crypto in many different interviews and he seems to solely focus on the idea that a digital currency is no better than a fiat.  He doesn't seem to ever really contend or give much thought to uses other than simple transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:33:20
Wondering this myself.

I bought in a bit of a panic with the uncertainty over what would happen with the Seg cancellation.

Damn straight. I’ll buy the chips, just not with my coin.

Youre conflating the word popular and adopted. It's not just that it's popular. It's that people are willing and are currently investing millions of dollars and hundreds and thousands of man hours to farm it. Farming it makes it more secure. So it's security increases its popularity which in turn increases its adoption which in turn increases it’s security. You seem to think that there has to be something inherent about Bitcoin itself that sets it apart from the rest as far as code and features goes. This simply isn’t the case. If you like the other coins that have copied Bitcoin, then you’re free to use them. Some of them are pretty safe too. The point is that Bitcoin happens to be the winner right now.  I don’t know anyone that cares about “Bitcoin” per say, as much as they care about the safety, decentralization, etc..  People can copy the Ford Mustang all they want.  So what?  There’s nothing inherent about any mainstream product that necessarily sets it apart.  
My point with all this is to say that his idea that, because Bitcoin can be forked or copied or whatever you want to say, that somehow means it’s worthless?  The US dollar has many competitors, but nobody says it’s worthless because there are other forms of currency.  The mere existence of Silver does not make Gold worthless.  It’s rhetoric. Plain and simple.  If it’s not rhetoric, it goes a long way to indicate that he very may well not actually understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies almost at all.
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:38:49
The hash power has gotten to such incredible levels that it would be nearly impossible to do an attack at this point. That alone makes it the safest form of currency in human history. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:54:24
Look man I’ve explained my position as well as I can. You seem to be stuck on the idea that Bitcoin is worthless because is core idea can be replicated. You seem not to understand that this was a feature built-in to bitcoin itself. As for the discussion of what makes something valuable how we assign value to different things I’m just going to leave this week in Pedia page below for you to read. I think it goes a long way to show just how meaningless the actual form of the value we give to things takes. In the case of the stones, their immense size provided them security. That security alone was enough for people to assign value to them and trade the idea of owning them.  So far you’re losing this argument based on rates of adoption and maybe one day I’ll eat my words but for now I would recommend you do more research on the underlying technology and reasons for adoption than simply looking at it as some form of digital currency that has no value because it can simply be replicated. Peace out I will no longer respond to this thread.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:52:40
You’re too quick to discount adoption. Who cares if it can be recreated? That is the whole point of forks anyway. The point is that the hashrate is part of Bitcoins feature. Hence it is safest. And that adoption means a higher rate of decentralization. Which many value. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:07:30
Again I think your discounting here. 
That number crunching is exactly why it’s valuable. It provides an immense amount of security to the network. The more secure the network is, the more likely it is that people will use it.  
Speculation is definitely part of it, I would never argue that point. 
It’s a digital means of transferring value that has *never* been hacked. That alone is quite valuable. 
The value of gold is also speculative. What the hell am I going to do with gold other than trade it with people who also assign it some arbitrary value?

@_date: 2018-11-15 18:00:30
all of those "positives" you just listed for **gold** can apply to any other **mineral** that mimics **gold**. therefore, the utility of **gold** isn't really scarce overall because alternatives can be utilized, because you should know that one of the definitions of money is scarcity. granted bitcoin is the lead horse in the race, but i'm not saying **gold** isn't useful at all, i'm just saying the price is WAY WAY overvalued for the utility you get from **gold** itself, therefore it is more of a speculative asset (that also serves a function). the price WILL come down overtime as my viewpoint spreads and people come to realize that **minerals** for imaginary number crunching isn't scarce overall.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:54:22
Can you give me some info on this.
