Well I have to disagree with that. He is referring to the "store value" in the classical definition of money, wich BTC is lacking, so it is not a money in the classical definition. 
He did't say anything about the BTC as a powerfull mean of exchange nor about the technologies that allows it.

Okay there is some points of comparison, Bitcoin is a disruptive technology as internet was.
On the other end the Bitcoin already had its bubble. I think they are pretty different in term of adoption rate, market size (in term of people), possibilities, concurence with other things (fiat currency, already existing mean of transferring money, when the internet had no concurrence). etc. 
This comparison is an interesting prism to see bitcoin trough, but this is way too simplist to grasp the whole picture. Comparing Bitcoin now to pre-bubble internet may be too optimistic and misleading in term of growth forecastin of Bitcoin adoption (and/or value).

In my opinion the position is simple and positive for bitcoin. The Autorithy for Control and Prudential Reglementation (or ACPR), a sub-branch of Banque de France has stated that it reckon BTC as a legal money. Wich is positive. 
They also made sure that that bitcoin providers and compagnies follow the same safety rules as other financial compagnies.  (The main one is that they have to keep enough liquidity to face a massive cash-out). I think this is positive too.
The last point is that you can only get Bitcoin trough providers that meet previous requirements. This is more about the fight of illegal transactions than customer protection. I think they cannot accept a purely anonymous mean of payment. We could discuss the philosophical consequences of this trade offbetween security and anonymity for a long time. (Just to be sure to be the first to quote Ben. F. : "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."). In the end I think this is also positive for Bitcoin in general. We need to be sure that the general public does not view BTC as a medium for drugs, tax evasion and market manipulations.

Far opposite frome true. Gold coins have always been issued by "institutions" (or on the name of a king / country). And were at the beggining 100% gold. 
Then there is always a point when liquidity is needed (for greater good, industrialisation, education of the masses or , in fact 99% of case, war) and the idea is to remove some gold of the coin and keep the value of the coin constant relying on the reputation of the country/king/dynasty wathever. Repeat the process 10 times over centuries and you have only one digit percent gold left. This point coincide generally with the fall of the civilisation it was relying on  and with the rise of another civilisation with a 100% gold coin currency. 
Then there is some war to fund. 
Recent time is no exception, probably worse in term of gold behind money.
I still think that institutions are better than no institutions but I won't make my point like that. (Unless you can see the leverage effect of relying on institutions in all that).

For the moment it is some kind of optimistic guess about the future.
Personally I hope that it will help people to allocate values more efficiently thus making the concept of holding money irrelevant. 
But from a law-makers (or academics) point of view it is a system that allows illegal things. And it will allow illegal thing (and not be competitive to other form of payment) unless big companies and/or governments get involved. The problem is that there is already a pretty safe/competitive network to exchange money, so no incentive to get involved in this market. 
On the paper Bitcoin looks attractive because it is way faster for transaction it won't be the same if governments/big companies get involved.

C/C from wikipedia ?
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (officially Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, Swedish: Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne), commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics, is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics, generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field. Although not one of the Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, it is identified with them, and prizes are announced with and awarded at the same ceremony.
Relation to the Nobel Prizes
The Prize in Economics is not one of the original Nobel Prizes created by the will of Alfred Nobel. However, the nomination process, selection criteria, and awards presentation of the Prize in Economic Sciences are performed in a manner similar to that of the Nobel Prizes. The Prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences "in accordance with the rules governing the award of the Nobel Prizes instituted through his [Alfred Nobel's] will", which stipulates that the prize be awarded annually to "those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind".

Krugmann answer to Business insider about the two main things he said he is criticised for:  
"Well, two things.
First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.
But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question.
And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics. "

Well I understood Krugmann tought exactly like that. For the moment bitcoin fails at the "store of value" part of money definition.
And It seems that the "store of value" part is likely to fail without some sort of monetary policy. 
So yes Bitcoin fail at being a money in the "store value" part and thus is not a money in the classical definition but it still has a "medium of exchange" characteristic and is better than government issued currencies at it. 
I don't really see where the Krugmann statement is false.
Now the problem is that a lot of people expect the bitcoin value to grow based on the "medium of exchange" characteritic when the growth mechanism is usually linked with the "store value" part.

"damage" is a bit strong here and now I see why there is a distance between Krugmann and the Bitcoin community. 
The problem is that among the infinite possibilities of bitcoin there is "money laundering", "tax evasion", "illegal transactions" and "market manipulation". So it would be counter-productive for governments, law-makers and regulators (and academics like Mr Krugmann) to advocate for it. It is unlikely that Crypto currencies are going "mainstream" without governments adressing those illegal activities. This will propbably involve a minimal amount of monetary policies, surveillance and regulations.

The title is not correct in my humble opinion. Banks will never use public blockchains as they don't want to publicise their businesses, that is as simple as that. They will (they already have) adopt sidechains and find new ways to trick the system, it is that simple.

see it like an insurance. Most common are options, if the price goes above or below a treshold you got some money. It's an insurance about price too high or too low. Next are swaps, an exchange between objects. Most simple swaps are swap between a variable rate and a fixed one. It's an insurance against the movement of the rate. 
One problem here is the value of the insurance. Would you value an insurance on a house as the price of the house ? Probably no, unless you plan to burn your house. The value used above is the notional, way more than interest insured...

(Partially) agreed, but it is still a crime and should be condemned as such. One cannot decide if law is ok or not for him. An obvious example would be murder: "Oh Mr the judge i don't think murder should be a crime in the first place. It's the law of the fittest.". That's exagerated but you get the idea that with some philosophy you could justify things forbid by law.
About silk road, you are talking about drug, with small drugs in mind (that should attracts a bit of clemency). But we are more probably talking about facilitating and profiting from exchange of important quantities of heavy drugs, fire arms, child porn, human trafficking, commending hitman... No i don't say it was the majority but was done and apparently some money ended up in his pockets.
