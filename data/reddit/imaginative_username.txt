Look at [the top video on youtube about bitcoin]( This is ridiculous. This thing seems to proliferate in china. I've read some threads on this sub about it being a ponzi scheme. Do you know more about it?

Haha that's brilliant or a fitness app that burns bitcoin if your smart watch doesn't register a sufficient heart rate increase at least once every other day.

I want to see more decentralized institutions use bitcoin. OpenBazar is coming!

What did your wife say when she figured out she fucked up?

I get where you are comming from. I see two ways you can interpret rule 34:
**1** - If something exists, sombody somewhere is aroused by it, and therefore somebody has made porn of it. Really it's saying something about the depth and range of human sexuality. Exemples :
    * Rubik cubes exist, therefore you can find porn involving rubik cubes.
    * Teletubbies exist, therefore there is porn of it.
**2** - If something exists, the porn industry is making use of it. It's saying something about a fearless industry not bounded by convetions and not afraid to innovate. In our specific case, the concept of the humble bundle.
   * Bitcoin exists, therefore, you can buy porn with bitcoin.
   * VR exists, therefore you can find VR porn.
I was arguing for the first interpretetion while you are arguing for the second. I believe the 1st is the generally accepted interpretation based on every instance in which I've seen it used. If you have anymore insights on the matter I would gladly hear it since arguing about stupid stuff amuses me. :)

Rule 34 applies exclusively to the content and not to the distribution method. If your videos featured the humble bundle in some way, rule 34 might apply.

It's not a question of resolution but compression.

I'm allowed to run around the pool table, yes. :)
