Bitcoin is still unusable. But hey, ist not a currency anymore. It's a fucking stock now. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:04:33
This. It's not like BU is a complete new thing. It's an addition. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:55:10
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:33:09
Well, even if you relay low fee transactions no miner would include them into his blocks. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:17:36
*after the Debatte about a scaling solution started. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:40:17
Most of the users don't care what solution is running in the background. They just want a cheap and reliable payment solution. These two subreddits are not representing bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:31:02
Well just change the port on the second node and forward it from the router. There is a little penalty for using a non-default port, but you should at least see some incoming connections. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:37:03
My strategy is to wait until the dust clears and there is a clear winner. Before that I won't touch my coins.  
To answer your question: I guess it will be enough to have a core and a BU node. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:58:53
Sure. If the chain forks you own the coins on both sides. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:44:58
Didn't happen in the last weeks. I hope with the new pressure from bu the undecided pick a side and we see finally a end to the stalling. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:59:59
If you lose your private key your btc are lost. Sorry :/
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:22:19
Not necessarily, you can shutdown your node, replace it, fire it back up and you should see the balance in the wallet as pending. At least until the blocks containing the relevant transactions are synced. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:36:03
Why should it? As I remember they added special rules for a hard fork case in their last prospect update. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:03:57
Effectively the same. On both solutions there will be chain splits imo. There is a hardcore opposition to SegWit AND to bu.  
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:56:07
Not existing.

Dangerous. So much shit can you wrong on a forced activation.

I'm sure we will see Mt. Everest memes too.

Yea, just have your coins on a local wallet and you are fine. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:46:50
Not over the gui. Afaik it's possible to create transactions over the cli. There was some discussions on the core irc to get the gui features quickly in 0.15.1

Nice to see that Switzerland is going the old &amp; the new finance heaven.

Nah moon is 384k. Plenty of room.

Coinbase.com is a pretty good beginner site. Also check out r/BitcoinBeginners 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:05:01
Put in scale. There will be only 21 million bitcoin ever. We are 7 billion people on this planet. Buy in (affordable amount, what you can lose) and don't panic if it falls a bit, it will come back. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:06:52
Too optimistic. Expecting a dip after the cme future launch in December. My bet is 8-9k at eoy.

The rollercoaster guy is the nornal meme that is used to visualize new records, but since over 9000 is also a common meme this was used instead today. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:53:18
Did you use bitcoin core back then? Maybe it's a private key? Check if the format matches with the samples on this guide. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:10:10
Still waiting for my 0.5btc to come back. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:12:35
Start dollar averaging now. Put in amount x every week/month and beat the market. Normally that should do the deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:08:51
The same questions where at every high. Don't expect a x10 from bitcoin anymore, but generally the crypto world is in a big growth. Diversify and and win. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:54:57
Not a big one, there is just a small penalty in the connect process, so btc core prefers nodes running on standard ports.
@_date: 2017-04-10 07:02:46
That the same question in any hardfork. Since you gonna create two coins it would be good if the majority and the important economic nodes are with you. Check any ANTI-BU post. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 18:43:09
Weekend effect. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 13:04:21
Strange, thought I'm subscribed to a Bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:42:40
Jup, but since you have only one ip address you need to run one of the nodes at a non-standard port. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:22:16
Japan Can. Also confirm in live.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:20:14
Bitcoin Core 16.0rc1 is tagged, so (if no major bugs are found) expect a final release in a few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:14:36
Firefox on all Plattforms. On Desktop the Performance is even or better than chrome. On Android I still prefer Firefox for the Addon support (Ublock origin mainly), but it can't compete with the chrome performance. Also I have the advantage of Firefox sync (Bookmarks, passwords) over all platforms.
Edit: the main reason I switched after years of chrome usage were privacy concerns. Even if you disable sync in chrome they send a ton of information home. I also think google is already too powerful. Heck they control the most popular search engine, browser, the ad market, mobile operating system and the biggest video platform. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 16:41:04
Yep, now I can finally get rid of chrome again. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:08:55
Your pre fork coins will exist on both chains. It works like ethereum and eth classic. They had a hardfork and some users refused to join, therefore two independent chains exist. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:12:23
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:23:56
Bitcoin ABC is doing that on Aug 1. Finally two independent chains. I think that's the best for the community. Should boost innovation and competition.

Isn't there a grace period of 336 blocks after Bip91 lock-in before bip141 signaling is mandatory? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:05:12
Excellent article. Worth the read. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:58:00
Dude really? Usage lowered and you take that as a argument to still do nothing? Yea, let's wait another year until everything is capped at max. Good Plan. Let's do that.

A bit. Bitcoin is risky. Get a diverse saving portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:51:59
With what wallet did you create that seed?
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:20:45
Steam, vpns

@_date: 2017-06-20 10:08:34
Nope, bu added massive new code parts to support xthin blocks.
