I'm glad to be of service. It'd be a shame if some blackhat noticed this and took advantage (this happened to me).

Yo! Where's my bitcoins? I deposited, but nothing's been credited to my account.
@_date: 2012-04-18 18:44:53
I emailed Dwolla about that. Here is their response:

Let me first say that this is AWESOME! This is a really nifty and clever use of bitcoin.
It's a bit difficult to understand what's going on here. Your secrets page has all the information, but it's in a confusing order. May I suggest that you simply reverse the order of the sections on that page?
Another suggestion: sha256 is a secure hash so sha256(secret.txid) *should* be unguessable. However, for the reasons stated [here]( you **really** ought to be using HMAC-SHA256 (especially if you're releasing the sha256 hashes of the secrets for the next 10 years). Most programming languages have a library that makes this easy.

That's a really good point. I hope satoshidice considers this possibility, even though it is unlikely.

Can somebody explain to me why Intersango is wrapped up in all this shit? I thought people were pissed at Zhou Tong and Bitcoinica, not Amir Taaki and Intersango.

Use [electrum]( You don't have to download the blockchain to use it. It's just install and go.
Disclaimer: I run the electrum server uncle-enzo.info

IANAL, but the lawyers that I've talked to (off the record) say that it's a non-issue because bitcoin isn't "really money" (speaking as the guy who wrote that quote)
Ninja edit: Bitcoin isn't money, therefore I'm not a financial institution, therefore I have no obligation to comply with the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act.

Hi! I'm the operator of Blind Bitcoin.
It is absolutely essential that your scheme avoid statistical analysis of the bitcoin block chain. I'm sure you've seen [this]( before, but it's worth reiterating.
Also, not to sound like the stodgy establishment, but I agree with syadasti. There's not a whole lot of money in this business.
@_date: 2011-07-29 00:08:44
Hmm... it works for me. I don't have a repo anywhere besides my own private servers. I can make a new tarball and put it somewhere else if you'd like.
I've re-tarred everything again, so maybe if you try now, it'll work.
@_date: 2011-07-29 00:01:41
In the last 24 hours, I've processed ~400 BTC.

Hi! I run Blind Bitcoin Transfers.
If you don't mind me asking, what sort of throughput do you see on your operations? (or is that a trade secret)
@_date: 2011-07-29 00:53:50
Yeah, but for small bitcoin amounts, the likelihood of getting your own bitcoins back is small.
The real reason that you want to have some time in between putting money into my service and getting it out is to make statistical analysis more difficult. It also gives you a greater degree of plausible deniability. (There are more transactions that can "collide" with yours the longer you leave things in the system.)
Tokens last for 53 days. (Actually, some last for 60 days, but it's 53 minimum) However, if somebody comes to me with a 61-day-old token and asks to redeem it, I would, of course, honor it. It's not like you're going to break my cryptography in any reasonable amount of time. I'd just have to process the request manually.

Well, if you do end up doing that, I'd love to see it! Even something with a rough estimate of block creation rates would be cool!
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:22:44
Hmm... Gavin's posts in the link you supplied seem somewhat at odds with how he appeared at the talk. We asked him about Zerocoin and he seemed guardedly optimistic about the future of Zerocoin when/if making Zerocoin transactions takes less space and time. I kinda confused now about Gavin's views on anonymity.
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:50:52
My general impression was that he recognizes that bitcoin can't scale the way it is right now and that off-chain transactions are a good way to fix that. Ultimately, I think it doesn't concern him because it doesn't directly involve the bitcoin protocol or the client.
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:27:41
Do you have evidence that Gavin is blocking off-chain transactions? I went to a talk he gave last Wednesday where he suggested off-chain transactions as a way to reduce the growth of the blockchain as bitcoin's popularity grows.

This is awesome! Could you, perhaps, also make one with calendar time as the horizontal axis instead of block height?
