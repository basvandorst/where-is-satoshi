It varies widely depending on where you live and how much electricity costs for you. According to the following link, which looks like it's from the year 2018, the electricity needed to mine 1 bitcoin can be as cheap as $1400 or as much as $80,000 per bitcoin, depending on which country you live in. In China it's $3600. In the United States, it's $10,700. I'm sure there are some people within those countries where it's more or less as well, that's just an average. Link:  [

I still look at my 401k a couple of times a month even though it's not exciting to watch. Not sure why, just like seeing the number go up (mostly) I guess. But Bitcoin is definitely more exciting (and oscillates with depressing) in a much shorter period of time, i.e. this week.
I wish I had a superpower of my foresight being as perfect as hindsight because I would have sold during this $4k+ drop instead of thinking it would be a brief blip. Now I'm still holding because I want to believe we're through most of the worst of it, and it will turn back around in the next few weeks.

Good idea. I've been tempted to pretend I put a certain amount of money into bitcoin for the purposes of day trade practice (I just buy a little every week right now), mostly out of curiosity and not out of a plan to actually try to day trade. Using software would make it much easier and I'd be more likely to follow through with it though.

If only more people were aware of Betteridge's Law of Headlines, they could just say "No." and skip the article.
 *This story is a great demonstration of my maxim that any headline which ends in a question mark can be answered by the word "no." The reason why journalists use that style of headline is that they know the story is probably bullshit, and don’t actually have the sources and facts to back it up, but still want to run it.*

Thanks for mentioning that. I haven't told my SO, who I've been with for several years and I'm marrying soon, that I have anything more than a tiny fraction of Bitcoin, and I've been debating if I should tell her now while it's still low, worrying that there'd be extra pressure to sell while we're still just barely getting out of a bear run. I don't want to keep secrets from her but I think of this as a positive secret, like I could surprise her someday with something nice. But at the same time I get worried she might get really mad that I didn't mention it sooner. I've been going back and forth on whether to tell her before we get married for a while now.

I looked and that was posted December 2013. When that guy posted it had crashed from a peak of roughly $1200 down to $600, and wouldn't get back above $1200 until January 2017. That horrible 3 year crypto winter. I remember sitting through that. I stopped paying attention after awhile since the price just never really moved during that (slowly crept down to $200, then slowly back up to $600). Ugh. Of course I should have been doing all I could to buy during that time, but that also coincided with a constant financial struggle for me. I even justified selling all but a small fraction of my bitcoin to help buy a laptop during that, which was probably 2 bitcoin at the time, for about $700, thinking I was going to make more money making and selling software with that laptop (I think I ended up making $1000 from it, so not really). Hope that guy hung on at least through January 2017.

I mean if it's literally free to take all the bitcoin that ever existed, sure why not. If nothing else I could make a museum display of a computer with a bitcoin wallet on it and try to get it in the Smithsonian or something.

I got in a little lower than you did. I was asleep, but just happened to wake up to use the bathroom right in the middle of the crash.
I've managed to catch three of the crashes in the past month, and snag a little each time near the bottom. Only wish I had more money to put into it.

Well you could buy another 0.05 at the lower price point. Suddenly your break-even point is now effectively at the halfway point between your original price and the new price. So if you bought now at ~$600, it's like you bought .1 coin at $650 instead of .05 coin at $700. If you wait and it drops down to $300 and you buy that .05 coin then, then your break-even point drops down to $500.
Since you have so little invested it's pretty easy to do this. I've been progressively lowering my break-even for my purchased coins by buying a little bit here and there as the price has been dropping.

My guess is weak hands cashing out at least partially to buy some nice gifts for themselves/family members. I could see that happening in general over the course of this next month. It might just be a minor drop, though.

[Bitcoin Paranoid]( app for Android has an alarm when the price fluctuates. It happened too often on some days so I disabled the alarm, but it's real useful regardless to check the price on the notification bar.

It's not profit until you've sold. Until then, at best, it's just potential profit. Anything you invest in could theoretically plummet to nothing very quickly and that 'profit' goes up in smoke.
Yeah, it's basically semantics, but it can be dangerous to be in the mindset that you've 'made money' before you actually have, because you might become to complacent and hold on to the investment for longer than you should have, and then ultimately risk losing money instead of gaining if it does drop a ton before you realize you should probably sell.

Just out of curiosity, is there a good website to see charts or something on these big transactions? I see the most recent 20 transactions on Bitcoinity, but I'd have to keep an eye on it all day to catch the big transactions.

That made me laugh, thanks :). For those who didn't get it, it's funny because it's not something bitcoins can do.
