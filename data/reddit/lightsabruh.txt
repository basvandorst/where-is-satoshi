would you say it is smarter to sell at 1100$ and then rebuy at whatever price it may drop down to or just HODL and wait for it to come back up
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:39:42
since we're in the same position, what will you do incase the ETF doesn't get approved? HODL or sell what you have now, accept the loss and try to profit from the dip?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:44:01
because a lot of people set their "accounts" so that it automatically buys bitcoin if it rises, thinking it's the SEC approving the ETF.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:53:35
My problem and the decision I have to make right now is: IF the EFT goes through -&gt; happy times...
But if it doesn't...do I either just hold/hodl on to my bitcoin and hope it goes up again after the certain drop, or do I sell at around 1100$ to minimize my losses and try to buy it "cheap" at around 600-700$ in the hopes of it going up again?
What would you do? Really trying not to lose to much money in case the the EFT doesn't go through...
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:05:19
That is my biggest problem...I just don't know whether I should take the risk of selling, accepting the loss and then hoping there will be a big enough dip for me to make up for my loss

which brand of diapers would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:03:04
and would you rather just hold on to your coins or take the risk? Because that's what I'm not sure about....especially considering I bought bitcoin at literally the highest price (1350$)...
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:40:32
That's what I was thinking. Invest 1/3 or up to 1/2 now and wait for the ETF decision. Also I already dumped all my money into an exchange just like you said.

They buy a shit ton of bitcoin at let's say 1200, the price jumps to 1300 triggers all the automatic buys, it jumps to 1400, they sell what the initially put in, coin goes down again
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:12:09
thanks man. Of course, Why would I lie... we all make mistakes
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:02:45
I wanted to hodl my money back until the decision was made, but as soon as I saw the spike I thought it was some insider shit and literally pumped in at 1350... fuck me
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:05:54
let's just hope the shit goes through...fuck me this is killing my nerves.
Thanks for your advice though!
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:56:23
fucked me pretty well
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:54:57
didn't know that. Not from the US
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:01:00
could you please explain?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:53:35
Bitcoin was pretty high ~1200$
Big investors pump in a LOT of cash to make it rise to ~1300$
Average Joe's Account gets triggered and buys bitcoin for him which makes the price incease even more to ~1350...
Big company X has now bought bitcoin  the price has risen to 1350, they sell their huge amount of bitcoin again and make 150$ with every coin -&gt; price falls down again.

Man I love matrix so much...Guess I'll HODL if morpheus says so
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:11:47
Problem is: If it hits my buy in price I might be able to get my money back....but if it THEN gets approved I won't be able to buy again because I bought more than half of my limit for today.... Guess I just gotta hodl on and pray now
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:10:27
Since I put a lot of my savings into bitcoin and I really have no clue how big the drop will be and when it will rise again I think I want to minimize the risk of losing even more money...But making more money sounds pretty good aswell

Anybody know around what time the SEC will announce it? EST? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:55:16

Maybe I worded it wrong: I'm trying to buy bitcoin but a lot of people don't accept paypal. What is the best "money website" to use?
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:05:00
Perfect thank you... I was so worried that if I buy bitcoin now and the price goes up I have to pay way more
