I'm 76% full of my trading limit.

Than go and buy "truly stable" and "mathematically correct" US treasuries and do not forget to cry to your mama when others have their "LAMBO" while you are riding a "bicycle".

To each their own, I suppose. But my experience in the market has definitely increased my portfolio. :)

TradingView is still better than Bloomberg or Reuters for crypto asset analysis. ;)

Buddy, I'm just a friendly pal!

Halving is a past and future performance indicator. Take your time to study this fundamental factor, pal.

Please see above.

I've being purchasing BTCs at 3-6 strongly and have bought at 8-9k for about 76% of my overall trading limit. 
 8-9k looks to me as a good buy-in level.

That seems similar, but the devil is in the details: BTC price does not reflect all the participants' view. Retail investors were not ready to take substantial losses and are disappointed with their trading decisions, so they ended up HODLing or negative P/L. On the other hand, institutions buy out all the BTCs they can have their hands on. So we have a picture where newly mined BTCs end up in whales' pockets and the place for FOMO occurs. That will drive retail to buy once again and drive the price up. They don't know about halvings at all.

That's it for today, pals! I'll be in touch, and if you're interested in these kind of chats with me, just let me know! I will try to answer other questions in my free time!

After the 3rd halving, the price will surely fall, just to fix profits to 15-20%. The correction may take 1-4 months. After which organic parabolic growth will occur.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:18:34
currently from 14 to \~10k
from 23k to 16k
from 29k to 21k
from 36k to 25k
from 42k to 32k 
and all the way up to 47-50k
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:15:19
Maybe. Are you in the New York area?
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:48:27
They neither believe in it, nor wanna get rich. Bitcoin is an instrument of ruling the world as USD and gold are. The primary goal of all the whales is to have control over the instrument.

If you mean the current bull run, than it will take us up to this Christmas. As for local high, 22-23k
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:30:52
Well, we should see McAfee fulfilling his eating obligations before this, as BTC will shoot to this price closer to 2024 lol.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:38:32
When we reach an all-time-high, FOMO will roll out. That would be sweet time, indeed.
