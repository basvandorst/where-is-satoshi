Great to see Bitcoin ATMs. I hope ATMs like this will sprout in different countries as well and will feature other cryptos like Bitcoin Private for example.

Actually, if you are buying, you're not the one who is required to pay Capital Gains Tax but the seller. Capital gains tax is tax on gains by the seller for selling capital goods or assets.

Oh this hit the nail on the head!

As I said, the Capital Gains Tax is a tax payable by the seller. Hence, if you're not selling then you're not liable to pay tax.

You will be subject to capital gains tax whether you sold in Canada or the US. The question as to where to pay the tax depends on where the delivery of the crypto sold will be as the situs of taxation as to sale of goods or assets is the place where title to the goods passes, which is the place of delivery of the goods or assets.

If only crypto exchange is regulated like a stock exchange then the crypto sold in said exchange would not be subject to capital gains tax just like stocks traded on stock exchange as the applicable tax would be a percentage tax. But since it is currently not being treated like a stock exchange then anyone selling crypto in said exchange is liable to pay capital gains tax in the place where the crypto exchange is registered. This is because the delivery of the crypto sold is considered to have occurred in the place where the crypto exchange is registered since the crypto is just being transferred from the seller's wallet in said exchange to a centralized exchange wallet during the time it is put up for sale then to the buyer's wallet in said exchange.

I think we should stop looking for the messenger and start understanding the message he left behind. A decentralized and private digital money like Bitcoin Private is what we should focus our attention to in order that the financial revolution started by Satoshi Nakamoto is not put to waste.
