Any projected release date?

Why would you have to call a tax accountant for buying a cup of coffee with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:39:10
On the nose.

I’m going to assume you are sending from an exchange that might not support native segwit. Does your address begin with bc1? If so create a segwit wallet and it should start with 3.

Ledger and Trezors are pretty simple hardwallets.

Cash app requests your social and a copy of your DL

No one is stopping you. It’s a real gamble on the fact that it’ll get that high and you’ll get a chance to buy it at a lower price.

I really don’t understand the purpose of USDC.
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:53:53
No. You would have to reset to factory each time and import with the other seed or have a second ledger.

My first Bitcoin was bought off an exchange called mt.gox in 2010 and I held it there for a bit. I decided one day to take it off and store my bitcoin on a wallet on my laptop mt.gox got hacked and lots of people lost their bitcoin.

Ledger nano x has an app you can use to set up and access via Bluetooth.
@_date: 2019-10-14 03:55:37
what did you buy?
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:56:00
Yeah the only ATMs near me use coinsource. I bought $25 in bitcoin and for $20 worth.

Just sell what you have, withdraw the usd to your bank account and use that to buy real btc
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:57:46
So it’s like a gambling app?
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:58:41
Gave me a giggle.
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:50:17
never owned any cryptocurrencies and I've never owned a bitcon? am I saying that correctly?
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:47:28
Why did you read them out loud?
Well anything is possible I think you’re being a little overly paranoid but better to be safe than sorry.
Someone correct me on this if I’m wrong but I believe you would have to transfer your funds to a different wallet and perform a factory reset and set the ledger up as new with a new set of words.
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:20:19
Not your coins, not your coins.
@_date: 2019-09-25 03:19:06
I like coinbase.

Im currently in cosmetology school. Once out, ill accept bitcoin at my barber shop. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:47:55
Tl;dr can you sum it up for us?
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:17:18
This is bullshit. Doesn't this mean some people will lose some bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-02-22 20:34:01
I always thought this.
