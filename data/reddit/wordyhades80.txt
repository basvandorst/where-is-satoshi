All you have do is keep your Bitcoin in a wallet you own and control, so keep it off exchanges. Also don't to make transactions for a day or two after the fork. I'm sure I can find a video for you.

I'm not sure there's much else, maybe pubs.

Key word "almost".

The futures could be a nice early Christmas present. The price will drop, so we get to buy at a discount ��������
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:51:05
You can sell Bitcoin for as much as you want. You can put it up for sale for 1 dollar when its 10k or or 10k when its 1 dollar, though no one would buy.

Hold 30€ worth?

"ComedyJ", with a name like that this must be a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:18
Have you not been reading this subreddit? People aren't exactly thrilled about Bitcoin futures, of course I took this as a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:00:13
Yes.

The first time I heard of it was when I listened to Andreas on Joe Rogan's podcast, so I was lucky enough to be given a great explanation of Bitcoin right out of the gate. Id never really listened to Rogan and I certainly had never heard of Andreas. I just thought "Antonopolous, thats a funny name" and clicked lol.

You can recover a wallet I'm sure. But your wallet may get compromised if its online so security wise its probably better to create a new wallet on the ledger and suffer the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:59:29
More like if you're buying 10 you'll get 4 or 5. Its not really worth it.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:27:21
Cheers! I really appreciate. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:44
Good luck lol

"Another problem is that the profits of new bitcoins that come with it do not benefit the government (as with normal money creation), *but are absorbed in heavily environmentally harmful computer power*."

Do the futures not open the market to some serious manipulation? Like a bunch of investors buy a bunch of Bitcoin, bet the price will go down and then sell their bunch of Bitcoin. I cant see why investors would really want to push the price of Bitcoin up. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:26:23
I feel better now for getting that out. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:03:49
Hot damn! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:11:32
I'll give it a shot 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:04:13
I tried to take out the thirty euro worth of Bitcoin i got when i made my first purchase and transaction fee was 15€ ffs

Who do you use?

Oh god no

Buy them back 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:38:52
Fiats value isn't going down. That's not likely to happened soon as Bitcoin isn't being used as an actual currency nearly as much as fiat. When Cryptocurrencies take over as the human race's main payment system, fiat will devalue. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:37:18
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:20:36
I'm going to use exchanges that don't conveniently go down when prices drop.    
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:38:31
Well I should say that the transaction fees won't come in unless you send it from the exchange to a personal wallet. If you buy 10$ worth it'll get to your wallet on the exchange without fees.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:04:00
Sure thing buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:12:26

Alright, relax there big man. Good lad.

Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:45:38
Its true about them being krusty old fuxx, but I think when you've got as much money as they do they have no reason not to buy and short Bitcoin. Worst case scenario for them they lose basically pocket change, best case scenario they short Bitcoin, the price falls bit and then they can proudly exclaim on TV that "Bitcoin is dead". 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:23:33
You could put the information from a paper wallet on a Christmas card, maybe cut out the paper wallet's QR codes and stick em on the card too. Slap a bow on it and you've got a nice gift. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:20:28
It was given to me for free when I bought Ethereum. I wanted to buy some Shitcoins with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:55:14
Really not worth it. Transaction fees will probably be at least half. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:27:07
Yup.

"so they can easily transfer their funds into another digital coin in case bitcoin falls out of popularity." How is he such an asshole!? I'm sorry for using insults but he and his stupid, incredibly punchable face piss me off so much. If your Altcoin is so good people will start to use it, how about building an attractive coin and let people come to it instead of ramming your shitcoin down out throats. (Probably my first, and I promise my last venting post on Ver)

Beautiful car.

I'm not coming to the defence of the hunters. The kind of people who go off and murder animals like Rhinos are scum bags. I was just saying from an emotionless point of view you can see why people value a physical good which they believe will give em' a hard on or cure their cancer, as people on the thread have said, when compared to something that's not physical.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:05
Lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:53:19
I just thought its a ridiculous criticism of Bitcoin. I bet this writer drives a fossil fuel powered car and lives in a fossil fuel heated home.

Oof. Hey Cheerios are bad, try our new 1$ cheaper alternative, Wheaty Os. The kicker is, our cereal is made of cardboard, without any of the Cheerio nutrition ;)

As soon as it hits your coinbase wallet you can send it to your private wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:52
It seems so. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:24:24
Its still a paper wallet obviously, but the recipient will I'm sure appreciate the thought and effort. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:50

"Far east friends" lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:52:30
Paper wallets can be printed, they'll have a public address with QR code and your private key with a private QR code so you can sweep the wallet. Its basically a prettier version of writing down your seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:17:12
In fairness, they are physical. You can hold it and look at it and craft things from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:21:49
Miners would be rewarded the transaction fees I believe.

I put my phone on airplane mode, generate a wallet using Jaxx, when it asks me to retype my private key I swap my phones keyboards a once every 4 words, bring my phone online once private key shits done and its written on paper. Put my address into a block explorer and delete Jaxx so my wallet isn't on my phone. Not very useful if you intend to spend it but you can receive crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:54:19
I dont have any skin in the game so personally I hope it doesn't reach 1 mil by 2020. McAfee seems like and all round piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:01
I really hope this you're not being malicious. In case you actually believe in BitConnect, it is a scam. Do not invest. Please. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:06:45
As Andreas Antonopolous says, this is a get free quick scheme, not a get rich quick scheme. I don't own any Bitcoin, but I do own other cryptocurrencies and at the end of the day isn't the outcome the same? I'm not seeing the prices of mine shoot up like Bitcoin owners, but then again do I really give a shit? No, because I have complete control over my money. Control over your money is why Bitcoin was made. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:25:03
I think they did it so they wouldn't get whacked by their government.

That's fair enough. Apologies I can't recommend a service to help your predicament. Best of look though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:43:21
I think you should just ignore Bitcoin. What's the point of accepting it if you want it turned into USD? I'd say cut out the middle man and just accept USD. But hey, that's just me. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:42:13
Hey guys, roger here, youre all really gettin my goat and I'd like you all yo stop! :'(
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:58:02
Yeah I'd say this is real alright. "Let me destabilise major world currencies so that I can prove how great bitcoin is" (paraphrase), I dont care that no one will be able to purchase bitcoin once I destabilise the major currencies. And I also dont care that people may have to wait hours to buy their groceries as the transaction has not been verified. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:52:03

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:13:15
I'm not sure how well I made my point so I'll just say, I'm not getting rewarded for owning my crypto with huge value increases, but I am being rewarded with money that no one but WordyHades80 can even "touch", which is reward enough for me.
