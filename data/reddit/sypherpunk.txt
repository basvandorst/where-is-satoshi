In the context of the conversation we are talking about which currency should be adopted at a large scale. The benefit of the recent public interest in digital currencies is a completely different conversation.
I understand the beginning of his comment is expressing distaste for the pretty immature obnoxious banter between the subreddits but I’m pointing out that there is value in banter. People are seeing which coin has actual merits and which coins only merit is being “OG”

He said “there’s merit to both”. Is BTCs only merit being “OG”?
I know the point of his comment is unification but let’s be honest at the same time.

The more we attack BTC with shit memes and no actual arguments, the more legitimate of an alternative it appears to be.

“BTC ripoff”?  Do you understand how crypto currencies work?
It’s not like stealing someone’s idea for a movie. If you have something that works better, you win

The whole point is that there is no such thing as ripoffs in digital currencies. These forks and new ideas in crypto currency work because people are allowed to improve on others ideas. It doesn’t matter fuck all where the idea came from, if it’s better then we need to adopt it.
You’re playing teams for the sake of teams when you oppose currencies because of how they are branded and how they originated. It’s painfully obvious to everyone else that this community has no counter argument to the advantages of BCH other than shitty memes. The only reason you’re still around is because you’ve committed yourself to being “Team BTC” and you’re too deep to switch now.
I was HODLing for Bitcoin until recently I made the switch, because it became clear to me that BCH is the better path forward. It want hard at all because I used logic rather than emotion.
The only reason Bitcoin is called Bitcoin is because it was deemed more successful after the fork. Obviously the name Bitcoin is strived after because it is the public’s only real label for magic internet money. Bitcoin Cash supporters want that name for good reason because it demonstrates adoption of a currency they deem superior.
The idea that wanting the name “Bitcoin” is some nefarious or scheming goal is ridiculous. Any currency wants that name right now, it’s just that BCH is the only other one with any claim to it right now.

Exactly! People call it a knockoff, but all that matters is that it’s *better*. Not “soon”, but right now. No waiting for indefinitely delayed upgrades

Take a look at the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek, I think you’ll find it’s a nice middle ground between the two.
