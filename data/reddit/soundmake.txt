Decentralization (to the degree it exists) is what gives bitcoin its value.
Most of the "retail users" of bitcoin use it because it can do what paypal, visa cannot or will not.  You can't make bitcoin increase in value by sacrificing its base utility in an attempt to become like every other payment method.
The crittical disagreement myself and people who are in favor of huge block size increases is that I know bitcoin can only become more valuble as a settlement network with competting "retail payment networks" built on top of it.

I support a limited increase of a few MB (about 4 MB in 2016).  Because I spent many hours over the years looking at the numbers and I agree with Peter Todd that it is mathematically impossible to scale bitcoin by blocksize increase alone.
I agree with Luke Jr in part but disagree with him in part.
I believe that a combination of off chain (lightning channels, side-chains, and even OP-Return of 80 bytes) can be used to dramatically increase the amount on transactions that can fit per MB on chain.
The massive push for a huge blocksize increase (originally 20 MB) and exponential scaling while dismissing many who are arguing for a smaller increase (or no increase, very few) as nuts or crackpots is NOT diplomatic.
I myself am guilty (if you look at my history) or becoming undiplomatic with the other side in this.

The biggest site I know of that both receives and pays out in Bitcoin is cryptothrift.com.  That one appears to be only a fraction as big as the biggest one ever bitmit.  By the time Bitmit grew so large that it was begining to compete with sites like ebay and fiverr, they suddenly announced they were shutting the site down.  It is almost like they got an offer they could not refuse.
I do sell some stuff on cryptothrift from time to time.  My concern is that if it keeps growing to the point where people like myself can start "paying the bills" from it, they will announce closure.
Fiverr does NOT receive bitcoin and it will be converted to fiat instantly. That is why they do not payout in crypto.  I can only speculate as to the reason why.

In other news, a citizen was arrested for jaywalking, risking a catastrophe, and conspiracy to rob a bank because he tackled a bank robber in the middle of the street who was running away.
The citizen was walking down the sidewalk when a man with a bag an one hand and a gun in the other ran out of the bank.  People were yelling, "He robbed the bank, stop him!"
The citizen then took action.
As he was tackling the bank robber some police showed up and arrested the citizen, he is now being held without bail.
The man who was seen running out of the bank, was released and may be facing a civil fine.

OP can challenge any copyright take down.
Then YouTube can side with OP after an internal investigation (not likely with PayPal, does happen with frivolous take downs by private citizens), or tell OP to file a formal show of cause in federal court.  
This is a public filing with all identifying information required (basically a self doxing).  This also requires filing fees etc.  
This is why only the big channels are known to file formal appeals of copyright strikes (they have income at stake), while the smaller channels are at the mercy of YouTube's internal copyright arbitration.

I remember Luke Jr arguing against a massive increase in blocksize and in favor of allowing real price discovery in the TX fee market.
This is a position I happen to agree with because I know exponential increases in blocksize will cause centralization and destroy the only reason for me (and many others) to be invested in bitcoin.
I did miss the part where Luke Jr spoke out in favor of obeying laws because some people in a fancy room wrote words on paper and sent others dressed in costumes to use force against others.

While many debate the legality of the Federal Reserve, and consequently the lawfulness of these notes, there is no doubt that in 1914 through 1933 the notes were backed by "... gold or lawful money... " (emphasis added). 
If this note is "redeemable" in lawful money, then clearly the note itself is NOT lawful money.

I know of only one way of judging the worth of an economic system, and that is by its fruits.
A system that leads to a general raising of the living standards for the highest percentage of the population while respecting the concept of property rights in this context is the standard by which I measure.  
So, your assertion that upward mobility not a true measurement of wealth as it is defined in our current "rent seeking" based economic system is a distraction from my point.








I don't have enough evidence to disprove that, but I disagree.

What types of payment do you accept?
"We accept payment by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover) and PayPal. If you would like to pay by check or money order, please contact us to verify the total cost of your purchase, including shipping and tax (if applicable)."
How so?

I am slowly coming to the conclusion that the next bitcoin ATH will not happen until near or after the next halving.

No, "The average citizen of the United Stated of America enjoyed the greatest increase in the Standard of living (real wages, compensation) between 1870 and 1913."
This was BEFORE fiat and you never disputed that point.
Nice try on the misdirection.

The reason I f*cking LOVE to see this is because most of those places still only accept fiat dollars and will roll their eyes when you offer to pay in bitcoin.

Thank you for the intelligent response.
I would have to concur with your argument.
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:57:22




Actually many do, they just do it at large lumps once every so many years instead of every 10 mins.  In the stock market in is called secondary offerings and share dilution.






Putting bitcoin into the jurisdiction and limiting it to a currency is the biggest mistake many of my fellow (anti-central bank fiat) folks are making.  This one argument hands a hell of alot of ammo to use against bitcoin to the enemy of liberty.

Closing the account is not the issue here.
The issue is that Gavin (who is not a judge or law enforcement officer) can make a phone call and get people's email accounts closed.

The average citizen of the United Stated of America enjoyed the greatest increase in the Standard of living (real wages, compensation) between 1870 and 1913.
By 1913 one of the fastest growing sections of the upwardly mobile middle class were the freed slaves who were starting their own businesses.
All of this happened without a central back and without an IRS.
And the NATION STATE of the USA was one of the most powerful on Earth.

Why don't you get a real job instead of being a paid mercenary to bring down the USA?

Every few months it makes the news that an innocent man was released from prison and with a public apology to them (along with a nice chunk of money sometimes 7 figures) when the real killer is caught.
So your argument would be to keep the innocent person in prison because "the victim who was murdered has not reappeared?"

AKA I will not even make a pretense of address your argument so I will use my skills of misdirection and deception.
I commend your skill in psychological warfare. 






























So you are an elitist who is defending the concept of slavery whether in the hard form (pre 1870), or the soft form we have today (rent seeking).
You showed yourself, someone who will defend the concept that "wealth" depends on an underclass.
A slave by any other name is still a slave.

"I'm so happy they didn't make the Silk Road movie before these revelations were made." 
and then from the same person....
"........federal agent is more of a villain and also has a lot more depth. More entertaining all around."
Ok, so if this is more entertaining all around, wouldn't a rational person prefer it made its way into the movie?
