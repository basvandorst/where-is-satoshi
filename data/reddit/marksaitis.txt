The article is misleading. It speaks about fake volume a bit without any evidence nor facts. Then the other half speaks about how well exchanges are regulated - which isn’t anything to do with the title...

Imagine an analogy. 10 people own a company and have 10% shares each. 8 of them decide to rename the company and change something - surely they have such right. If 2 leftover people decide to do something else, they cannot decide on the name nor anything else. Naming is very important. This is how we reference things. So can somebody tell me? Does anybody even know?

Love the name, cryptohuj :D

so who rules it? this paper doesnt explain who gets to decide on new rule. the people who mined most bitcoin? or people who have most hashrate today? or what? its super unclear...

Hello folks. I have a simple question. If 80% of miners agreed to increase block size and it also conforms to original paper, then can somebody *** explain me, why the chain supported by 80% is not considered the original chain? Does anyone understand this???? Makes 0 sense!
