So bitcoin is backed by chicken?

I'm pretty sure he's not sad.

Wouldn't our money in the bank be down too then anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:04:03
Im pretty sure he would have. Now he can cash it himself.

Either way, transactions shouldn't have cost that much though.

People will need to open accounts. Even the homeless in Zimbabwe manage on old phones to transfer money.

People are lazy. If its too much work, the majority are not intrested.

How easy would it be to access your bitcoin during a crisis as well? No power no internet. I could probably trade money and my real gold for things.

Not many are spending Bitcoin though, just hodling on. Gold may not be used as much before but it is still a big part in life.

Back reading the fall of Silkroad here, I thought it was done for.

3 years? That's some real wishful thinking dude.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:56:05
I don't think anyone's going to buy anything really. Be worried that those bits will be worth more next week and just use cash instead.

There are 3 gold buyer booths in my Westfield alone. Easy enough to convert into cash and must be a lot of people doing it to keep the business running. We're just sitting here laughing at people not getting into bitcoin, when it's the masses that need to get into it to make it a truly viable currency. An article in the news is helping but more people wanting to spend it would make it even better.

So has the usd stopped working too now?
