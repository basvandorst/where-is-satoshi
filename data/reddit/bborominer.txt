My experience with regulations is that they create friction in a system. It also creates a bureaucracy you have to go threw to get any thing done.

Yes.

Looks interesting when you release it let us know!

As a small time miner myself my thoughts on this are as follows. 1. Bitcoin price dropping makes it a BAD idea to get into mining right now. 2. If you are still set on mining buy the high end, most advanced mining equipment. 3. If you have access to free electricity disregard 1 and 2 and buy whatever mining equipment you want.

Do you know if there been a consensus on whether it would be less regulated as commodity versus a currency ? 
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:34:02
We are not there yet. 150$ is the break even price for most.

Thank you :)

Sometimes it is not A or B. Sometimes people want a C choice. Bitcoin offers that. It will never overtake the dollar...... so what.

I will sell you some using pay pal if you want :)

From what I have gathered threw watching trends and reading, this is the most likely outcome. Bitcoin price stays at current price range and a huge majority of the miners will quit mining. The most efficient miners will mine at a much smaller profit. The next possible out come is that the price of bitcoin rises to around 600$ off setting the reduced reward.

I have been thinking that a bitcoin raffle web site would be kinda cool. Maybe have a daily, weekly, monthly raffle. What do you think ?

This entire article is written of a false primes. It dose not matter if Bitcoin is 1$ or 10,000$. Bitcoin is a means of exchange. It has no intrinsic value other wise. However Bitcoin is the best means of exchange ever invented.

A good article. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:47:28
Considering the fact that it is a limited resource it would seem to me that it is a commodity. Looking at it from this perspective I think bitcoin should be regulated(protected) as privet property.

She is hot..... makes me want to buy more bitcoin..... :D
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:27:35
Thanks! din't see that. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:04:25
Ok. U cool with a small amount ? 
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:57:20
Yes lol as far at the bitcoin trading goes that is. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:33:11
Do you know how to set up a trading bot? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:32:25
Can you use Pay Pal ? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:36:39
That is precisely what I am seeing in the Bitcoin world. In my opinion trust is what is holding Bitcoin back the most. If you look at the U.S. dollar it is the strongest/most trusted currency in the world. If Bitcoin could be the most trusted currency then it would also be the strongest.

Say you wanted to buy a "X" from me. And I said it was going to cost .5 BTC. What would make you trust me to send me the .5 BTC ? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:49:55
If you set up your Coinbase account with your bank account and your credit card they take the money from your bank account, and you get credited the bitcoin instantly. They will not take the money from your card unless your bank account has insufficient funds. While it still takes 3-5 business days for the payment to clear you bank account, you will get credited the bitcoin instantly to spend how you want. That has been my experience so far.

Hi Maria, 
In regards to the Forex trading do you have to be watching the market "24/7" to make money ?
What trading platform do you use also ? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:33:34
If you enable your credit card then it will be available instantly. What is funny for me is the fact that I only have a 400$ credit limit on my card, yet I got 1000$ instant buy.

18tQ4jCJG8nNKFFZyVecDFt5TbtyTBBL4w Just send me 25 BTC and I will send you the rig.
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:39:08
It takes about 5 seconds for me. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:37:18
Magic. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:42:00
And that is where if we were doing the deal in U.S. dollars I could have you sign a contract first and then send you the product. If you do not pay I sue you........ With Bitcoin I send you the product and then you "Ivyleague481" who said you were from Kansas, laughs all the way to the local African pon-shop. Then I go out of business. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:14:12
It means, buy more bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:27:34
