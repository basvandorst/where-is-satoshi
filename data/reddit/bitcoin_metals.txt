IMHO bitcoin is complementary to precious metals.  Both hold strong arguments for a reliable store of value.  I love them both so much, I designed a line of bitcoin inspired  jewelry.  (new website launching soon)  Now the only thing I need to do is figure out how to integrate the two.  Here are a few designs if you'd like to take a look -

Same credentials, however I did change my phone and had to download a new google authenticator app.  Only support I see is mcxnow on freenode - nothing happening there.  So it's a phone issue huh! I have no clue how to fix this one...  Thanks for the reply.

I haven't logged in since february or march.  Just realized there is a Nov 15th deadline.  Put about 2K in maxcoin and since it fell through the floor I just forgot about it.  probably not even worth $200 now.  Anyhow, I can't even log in - when I plug in my credentials the page just refreshes.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not crying about it... I've pretty much written it off as another lost crypto investment but if there's a chance to get my maxcoin's out I wouldn't mind going for it.  Any advice... Cheers.
