I'm saying that while USD might be it's own beast now - it was once completely dependent on gold (the dollar/gold ratio did change in 1934 btw). 
BTC doesn't have a government or even gold to back it, so we use other currencies to equate value with BTC as it has NO inherent value in its' own right.

If you mean that I can pay person A using bitcoin and they will receive USD without ever seeing the bitcoin then yeah, I misread that.
For the other, it doesn't really change my thoughts on Bitcoin. I think it is a cool idea but at the moment I can't really consider it a currency. It's more like investing in stocks.

As I said, money fluctuates but it does NOT fluctuate like bitcoins. When was the last time your rent suddenly cost double while you were living there? Pretty much never would be the correct answer. 
Over the course of 114 years, 
there has been an average inflation of about 3 percent. That is how your currency is supposed to work.
Since BTC is trying to be a currency, it will ALWAYS be compared to other currencies just like we compare other currencies against each other all the time. 
If you'd rather the argument ignore USD then here we go: You want to buy a car for 1BTC but right before you do the market crashes and 1BTC is now worth only .416 of what it used to. The car dealership still values the car at the original 1BTC price so they inflate the price of the car to 2.4BTC and so now you need to save up another 1.4BTC to even afford it.

I don't mean that the price of bitcoins is too high or too low, I mean the price of bitcoins is too volatile. 
Another user that responded mentioned the price crashed from 1200 dollars to 500 dollars. That shouldn't really ever happen with currency. Inflation/deflation is normal but it needs to be a much more gradual change. Think about it, say you saved up enough money and bought a bitcoin with the intent of buying a used car that just so happened to cost 1 bitcoin (1200 dollars). The second after the crash, you now need to go and buy another 1 and 2/5 bit coins to afford the same car (because they aren't going to be suddenly think the car should be worth less) so in the scheme of things you just paid 1900 dollars for a 1200 dollar car.

I don't hate bitcoin or anything but didn't it drop like 600 dollars in value not all that long ago? I feel like we need a good few years of mostly stable bitcoin for it to be readily recognized as a legitimate currency.

USD might not have been checked against pounds every day to measure the currencies worth - but it was checked against gold. USD is to BTC what Gold was to USD. 
More to the point though, I never said that BTC couldn't work as a currency - just that it will not be a legitimate currency UNTIL it stops being so volatile. It honestly seems like you are on my side since you admit that BTC is in flux right now so I'm not 100% sure what we are even arguing about here.
Do you honestly think that BTC isn't a volatile currency?
