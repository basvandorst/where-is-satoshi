on 1 single graphics card, maybe. but ive got 11. im not really sure though how long though to be honest. I just let it sit in my garage, and it pumps out coins, its pretty sweet
@_date: 2012-02-21 03:13:48
I pay about $90 extra a month for power, but i get about 12 coins a week, so i a ballpark figure is about $260 a month, so about $170 a month after electricity. it goes up and down a lot with the market.
Anyways, specs are :
5 computers, each with 2 5850's, plus a 6970 on my personal comp. each of the 5 systems on the rack have 1GB ram, and a shitty AMD CPU. AMD's newest line, but there newest shittiest line, Sempron i think. 600w PSU's, and the hard drives are whatever sata drives i found cheap.

about 75c, so not hot. I may load up linux on one and test it out, thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2012-02-21 04:41:41
yeps. I know posting your address is a stupid idea, which is why i have more than 1 wallet. If my wallet with the address listed gets messed up, my main one is fine.
@_date: 2012-04-14 19:18:08
3ish GH/s
@_date: 2012-02-21 18:47:53
you're right. I havnt been able to do that yet. My machine has been up for about a month.
@_date: 2012-02-21 18:59:23
I use deepbit simply because its the first one I came across, and it seems to work decently well. I may look into aoclbf. is it any better? i get about 3GH/s with all 11 gpu's mining
@_date: 2012-03-24 02:33:23
lol, i think you misunderstand mining. Send me your wallet address if you have one, and i'll send you a coin, just because im a Baller like that.
@_date: 2012-02-21 03:15:20
any donations to building another one of these will be greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2012-03-20 23:25:27
If you seriously think that's pot, you're stupid...
@_date: 2012-02-22 00:50:45
lol, all 5 of the comps on that rack can max out crysis, and yes, i have specifically tested this on one of them :)
@_date: 2012-10-07 16:14:55
Hahaha you caught me. I'm actually shooting 2 more videos today for it. One being an Apple commercial parity, and then a Mario themed, block breaking vid. But yes, I am trying to win.
@_date: 2012-04-02 02:11:02
What's inside of them, and how much do they cost?
@_date: 2012-02-21 14:16:17
i use
bitcoin wallet client
logmein   to control the systems remotely
@_date: 2012-10-13 00:36:49
Dude, if you ship me those solar panel's, i'll give you 20btc, and probably a cake. it would be awesome to have
@_date: 2012-02-21 05:25:51
no, thats why its called a donation. Ive donated coins to people in the past. Thats the point of the currency, to be traded however we want. To prove a point, send me your wallet address and i will send u 0.5 coins.
@_date: 2012-04-12 04:39:50
PM me and i will sell you however many you want. below is a pic of how i get my coins
@_date: 2012-02-21 19:09:38
10 5850's across 5 computers. 600W PSU, shit ram/cpu/hd.
Ive already posted it in battlestations, so no, but thanks for asking instead of just doing it
@_date: 2012-02-21 05:20:47
I do pooled mining on Deepbit if thats what you mean? I will have to look into how to get these to pump out more, it does seem like they can do better.
@_date: 2012-02-21 03:09:04
generally about 12 coins a week.
@_date: 2012-04-14 19:37:59
I read the comments below and they're all pretty good. My advice, get a cheap SSD, or a regular speed one. velociraptors take too much energy to run.
Also, im ordering a BFL single. a few of those will make my entire rig pictured below useless.

ya, its a server rack. The dorm with free electricity idea is awesome, BUT, i had to rewire my garage and install 2 20 amp circuits, each running to a separate outlet. Most wall outlets are 15 amp, and wont be enough to power something like this, just be aware of that issue.    If i didnt have to pay for electricity somehow, it would be amazing.
@_date: 2012-03-08 05:32:26
The ridiculous amount of heat the 10 gpu's generate is enough to keep my marijuana plants(pictured above) warm. :)

when i underclocked the mem under 500ish, they kept locking up. Im using Sapphire trixx, what are u using for it? Also, what flags are u using?
@_date: 2012-02-21 04:49:05
meh. surprisingly, ive gotten coins in the past this way. plus, im still in the process of making back what i paid for the rig.
@_date: 2012-02-22 00:40:42
little over 3GH/s
@_date: 2012-03-24 17:35:26
@_date: 2012-02-21 14:01:35
just a garage. The comps are in special plastic housings so it has a lot of open room to "breathe." And its just regular case fans. I use sapphire trixx to control the fans, and overclock them.

I'm not familiar with BFL singles, and googling it wasnt as easy as i was hoping. Can you tell me more about it?
@_date: 2012-04-15 18:03:39
a lot. about $90.00 a month
@_date: 2012-03-24 02:56:24
just build a rig like mine, and mine your own coins
@_date: 2012-02-22 14:03:25
im actually in the process of switching over to mtred.com, because of all of reddits advice. Thanks.
