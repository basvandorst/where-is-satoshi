This is incredibly normal and not inconvenient in the slightest if you spend 5 minutes talking to your banker about setting up your account.

In the same way that getting your wallet stolen at the bus station is why people choose not to flock to paper money?

Email was also protected by 2FA, the password was long (10+) with symbols and capitalization, and it was  I never really looked at my wallet at all, except a couple times through the Blockchain app on my phone, and also on my desktop, which is Ubuntu and also reformatted pretty much every 3 months.

Ubuntu 12.04

But to be clear, a malicious android application can access the generated 2fa keys? or would it bypass the login altogether and just tell the Blockchain app where to send coins, when you log in to view your wallet?
Because I don't think I'll use the Blockchain app anymore either, if the latter is true.

I think the point is that payment via banks depends on human workforce, I'm not really sure how it works, but don't checks need to at least by confirmed by an employee of the bank? Whereas with bitcoin the entire process is automated, and not by any particular employee or computing system of a company, but by distributed volunteers.
But you are right, delays caused by user error exist both with banks and bitcoin.

Well, pretty simple. Ubuntu 12.04 running basic, nonbitcoin software. I had a windows partition as well, I had login alerts of someone trying to login to my btc account about 6 to 8 months ago, so I used my rarely used laptop to change my passwords and add 2fa. Laptop was running ubuntu as well, pretty much fresh install, I rarely use it.
I never install bitcoin desktop software. After adding 2fa to everything I stopped getting false login alerts, except I got one for gmail, however it already had 2fa and a decent pw, it was just a false login attempt, I figured anyone could do it so I ignored it. This was 6 to 8 months ago still.
I casually used a few bitcoin apps on my phone downloaded from the android marketplace, including blockchain, coinbase, bitcoin paranoid. I also used WhatAndroid which crashed a few times, perhaps suspicously when running my blockchain app....
I used google auth for blockchain, google, and btce. I used authy for coinbase.
I used email confirmation for btce withdrawals.
Interestingly, I had some leftover (only 0.03) btc on btc-e that was not stolen. This used 2fa for login and email confirmation on withdraw. Blockchain.info only had 2fa enabled on login. And it was not enabled when I logged back in to find an empty balance. I only lost 0.3 btc, which isnt much, but it feels very invasive...
But whoever it was, they could bypass blockchain's 2fa and remove it (why would they need to remove it if they were already logged in, unless they removed it without logging in?) Why didnt blockchain email me that my 2fa was disabled? Howeever they could not bypass or remove btc-e's 2fa. Or they could, but couldnt not access my email to confirm a withdraw--they never tried.

Well I definitely did not have my entire savings in my bitcoin wallet!

You should assume the comic is delusional in the first place since they are treating bitcoin like an investment. And that he's talking to a *banker* about it.

Maybe satoshi is a developer team.
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:29:37
....interesting. I have WhatAndroid installed. My password was 10+ characters long with symbols so that might be less feasible, yeah?
I also have the blockchain app on my android device, I automatically assumed there was some malware on my desktop, never thought of my mobile.

thanks, hard to think straight up here on the moon

gmail, also secured with 2FA using Google Authenticator, unless accessed by my personal computer.

Dont worry. Last time the value shot up like this, people bought right at the peak ($266) before it crashed down all the way to $50. A lot of people panicked and sold between $200 and $50 to "cut their losses." You don't lose anything unless you sell.

I feel like the only financial / investment advice that I ever get is "Don't do what anyone says you should do"

Maybe it will maybe it wont. Maybe it will in a couple days. Maybe weeks. Maybe years. Maybe never.
Can't tell the future pal

well if your definition of solution must include a central authority, you'll find it very difficult to find any solutions at all in peer-to-peer technology...

The panic will return as more and more people hear the news.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:08:13
last time this happened people lost so much because they bought at $250+ and then panic sold below $150... and look at bitcoin now.

From the quote in the article it sounds like sr2.0 forums are 100% compromised...
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:36:56
I have a very vivid memory of being called a "muppet" for buying in at $45

They make it sound very easy, but the first step is the hardest... find cointap card in a store. It will be easy if they manage to get stores worldwide to sell cointap cards. If not, it will be difficult. They haven't solved anything yet.
What would be truly easy is if they accepted cards that are already sold worldwide.

bounces like rubber. i was so excited too..

So what does the fed do with that bitcoin? Sell it for usd? Destroy it?
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:31:36
bitcoin doesn't aim to be the solution, it aims to be part of the solution.
