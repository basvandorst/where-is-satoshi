Hello everyone! I'm Simone, a Bocconi University student, currently enrolled at EMIT (Economics and Management of Innovation and Technology). I'm writing my Master Thesis about determinants of (and barriers to) Bitcoin adoption as a mean of payment.
In order to collect data about Bitcoin usage and perception, I'm administering a questionnaire about bitcoin usage patterns. It'd be really helpful for me to gather as many responses as possible.
Please note that your responses will be reported in an anonymous and aggregate form and will be used for academic research only. Should you have any comments or concerns about completing the questionnaire or participating in this study, please feel free to contact me, Simone Forestieri, per email at [simone.forestieri
