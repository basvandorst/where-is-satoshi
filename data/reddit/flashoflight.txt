I think this is actually good for the market. Its better to learn these things now and diversify. The free market will work around this.
Also now is a time to start spending coins. To get them circulating. The crash brings attention to the amount of hording. 
It's a huge blow but not the end. Most of us,hopefully, we're in this because we understand the need for bitcoin. That need has not gone away.

Would love to help test. It doesn't work here though :) 
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:07:32
True. But this will also happen naturally as well I think. Or....you just found a very good business opportunity in the philipines. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:21:13
I don't mean buy bitcoin. I mean spend bitcoin. Support the market places that are selling goods. Support people that are accepting it in their stores. Stop hording and start using.

I've been in china. My apologies. Glad people are thinking lol

Who is John Galt? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 02:41:21
I feel like it's actually a good thing because we want users using the coins. If they have bitcoins to use, they are going to get merchants to accept it. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:20:27
I can't use BTC to purchase?!...wth? 
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:41:40
We should really be spending them for the future of bitcoin. I'm going to try and shop early for xmas and use only bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 07:24:02
Can't upvote this enough. Make it easy. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:58:00
I don't understand why this doesn't work in HK. Are they just piloting it in the US? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 05:16:55
I'm totally tuned too. OP will surely deliver. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:40:06
Extra word I put. 
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:17:20
Lol don't forget about Greta. Without a habitable planet, bitcoin won't be worth anything.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:56:15
Lol - sounds like someone is projecting.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:54:53
This post should be higher. They are linked in that regard. No need to put Greta aside - they know things are broken and are trying to fix them.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:53:06
Lol seriously.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:52:29
Lol don't you physically see the weather changing around you? Get out of your house. Contact some people from around the globe and ask them if the weather is "normal". The oceans are pretty big - you don't think that the temperature increases are alarming? When's the last time you went out of house, your town, your country? 
Yes - we, as humanity, have always had existential crisis scams. But the science is plain and clear.

It is super scripted - but to be fair...its a speech. Speeches are normally scripted. I would love to see an interview though.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:53:47
Hide behind children? This little girl is asking for help. You're just crude enough to turn away from it.
@_date: 2011-07-02 03:40:33
Thank you. Someone has some sense. 
@_date: 2011-09-07 05:33:25
Really? Downvoted? Wtf..Without even telling why?
@_date: 2011-09-07 23:16:21
Ah. I didn't even know it existed. Thank you.  
@_date: 2011-09-08 14:54:57
These are very valid points. They have been made by others as well. I have decided to not mine via my computer or until I get a nice graphics card. 
Thanks. I'll change it on the post too so there isn't any confusion. 
@_date: 2011-09-07 05:16:44
Not government's electricity. I pay dearly for it. 
@_date: 2011-08-08 17:08:19
These services will come. It's called insurance.
@_date: 2011-09-13 00:43:51
Count me in
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:35:27
I've reached a lot of people through the social arguments. That if we all buy into this structure it has the opportunity to level the playing field. &gt;50% of the capital in the world is owned by the top 1%. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:58:02
FIXED so it fits in a facebook banner :) 
@_date: 2013-01-02 15:40:26
This is a really good idea. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 05:12:39
Ah...looks like Bitcoins can solve that problem. 
@_date: 2013-01-02 18:14:18
That's absolutely true. I did reach out to one company because I am thinking about finding a new job and saw a few opportunities. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:33:06
How can a bank tell you where/where you can not transfer your money. This is so ironic it burns. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 03:30:49
same exact problem here. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:33:46
hahaha this was my first thought too. Time for Dwolla to move to another country. All 3 of their employees. Good job USA....chasing away the future of business. 
@_date: 2013-01-03 03:49:35
where's that?
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:53:45
Bitcoin lottery...is a great idea. We should push the profits to charities. If the charities want to accept the bitcoins then they need to accept bitcoins as charity donations in the future :) 
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:49:30
What do you guys use for android? 
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:16:01
This is just the beginning of US trying to gain control of the positive support for bitcoins. We just need to keep talking about it. We need a bitcoin manifesto haha 
@_date: 2013-01-24 16:17:52
