Thanks! Yes, I will do that.

Hey, names Tyler, and just this week I launched an open-source Bitcoin crowdfunding platform called [Bitpieces]( . 
Its been pretty tough for me too as a Bitcoin startup. Granted I'm only a week old haha, so I don't know the troubles you guys have gone through. I live in florida too currently, so let me know If there's anything I can do to help out seans outpost. 
The basic jist of the site, is that you raise funding by issuing pieces, kind of like stocks. Its an alternative to kickstarter, which has a funding goal; with Bitpieces, you support anyone by contributing to their brand. People could potentially fund sean's outpost in this alternate way, by owning pieces of it, and literally being able to say that they're your  fans. I'd waive the fee completely of course.
I'd do anything to get you guys signed up, if you'd be interested. I'd love to contribute to you guys. Look the site over and let me know what you think.

Bitcoin web app developer here. I created [bitpieces]( an open source bitcoin stock market with dividends. 
Some of us are hard at work trying to bridge the gaps.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:00:40
It doesn't use any altcoins, just straight BTC for pieces. You own the pieces, but all the actions you do with them are internal to the site: buying/selling them, and earning rewards from them.
I'd definitely like to do some alt-coin integrations, once one is developed that has a good system of automatic and continuous dividends.
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:18:05
Oh my god, this is incredible! I really should switch my site to this because I'm looking to get off Coinbase.
Few questions: does it issue callbacks? I need to make sure payments go through. Coinbase gives you tons of callbacks at every transaction conformation.
Does it generate payment buttons, or something which I could create my own payment buttons from?
This is really great.
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:21:38
Thanks! Absolutely love the site. And good luck to you too sir.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:23:39
Wikipedias definition is : a software-based online payment system.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:16:37
Thanks! let me know what you think. I'm trying to improve it a ton, and any feedback helps.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:36:40
Any amount. If you want to raise $10, you could issue 1 piece for $10. 
Or 10 pieces for $1. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 01:59:49
Thanks! Primarily, getting content-creators to sign up and start selling pieces.
I'm a lowly software dev, and a total marketing noob, so I have no idea how to grow the user base. I'd really love to get some bands and artists signed up, and linked to their own sites, showing off their work, and watching the price of their pieces fluctuate, and see more people get enthusiastic about bitcoin stock and dividend possibilities.
The biggest criticism it gets is that it should just accept USD, because it is a really nice interface. I'm of course keeping it in BTC, because it has to stay international and regulation free, and cause internet money rocks.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:20:43
This is very true, the SEC probably wouldn't like this. 
Its also primarily why BTC is used, and there isn't any way to use standard US-based credit card processors. In reality the SEC has no more jurisdiction over the transactions than the financial regulatory agencies of norway, peru, or south korea.
Right now, the project does use coinbase(which is US-based) for its transactions, but if they even hint at a problem down the road, then it'll be easy to switch to bitpay, or any number of future ones down the road.
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:53:43
I'm a bitcoin webapp dev, currently using coinbase as my merchant payment processor.
Coinbase has great functionality, but unfortunately it does adhere to some pretty hardcore KYC rules : linking bank accounts and such.
I'm looking to move off them, but don't know what the best personal merchant-services ones are. I don't even know how to look for them either. They mostly use bitcoinj I think. Does anyone know the best bitcoin merchant services that run in their own webserver, so that I could accept bitcoin without going through a third party?
That to me would be the best way to defeat all this. Just stop using centralized merchant services, so they can't trace bitcoin activity to citizens. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:03:16
Thanks, I definitely agree.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:18:06
Fraud is a pretty gigantic topic, but it occurs on **large, regulated** stock exchanges too... just look at enron. 
IMO, regulation does not equal security; Only openness and accountability. That's what the blockhain is about.
Bitpieces has 5 safety measures in place to make sure that content-creators don't just run off with the funds, including:
* Safety ratings(which = the number of years a creator can safely pay dividends)
* Verification (They have to verify their content through their website/email)
* Open discussion threads on every page
* Transparency
* Mandatory rewards
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:50:09
Hey, thanks for checking it out!


After you logged in, don't you see [this button]( on your dashboard? I just tested this with two test users and it works fine. 


I was originally weighing a reddit-style login/signup vs a Instagram one. In the end, because I wanted some consistent internal ids, I decided to go with reddit-style. 
But I agree that it is important enough that 2-factor auth should be included. I'm going to add 2-factor auth to my list of TODOs, and hopefully have that working within a few weeks.


I absolutely agree with this. Right now, the project is small enough that its just me, but once it grows, I plan on hiring a team, and getting some mobile apps in the works will be a top priority.
Any issues you have, feel free to add an issue on the github repo.
Thanks a ton, I'm glad you like the site!
@_date: 2014-08-25 22:59:22
Will do.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:36:09
Just a note, that there is no transaction fee for depositing, or withdrawing for funders. Apart from what coinbase may do(they're not supposed to charge anything).
I'm pretty sure I do have the page do a refresh after a deposit or withdrawal is made, but I can test this again on the test site.
It definitely is on my list to implement at least google login within the next few weeks, and then probably facebook. I totally agree that its a good idea for a lot of reasons.
Let me know if anything else needs fixing/tweaking, or any suggestions at all. Thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2014-08-26 02:19:44


Right, they are raising BTC, and when they do withdrawals, they withdraw to their own bitcoin wallets. 


Absolutely, as does anything that brings people to buy bitcoins. The more demand for it, the more likely the value is to go up. 
Once amazon starts accepting BTC, then I'll shit myself and get rid of all my dollars entirely, haha.
My plan right now for spreading the word is to reach out to people in different artistic communities, like music, comics, youtube-channels, etc, and see if they'd be interested in raising funds this way. I think that'd bring a lot of people to bitcoin in general, when they realize they can fund their favorite bands and artists they like.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:39:48
Being a java developer, of course I'm big on DRY. But with html, doing that requires a major sacrifice in speed.
When you load a webpage, the html loads very quickly, but any other injected elements are loaded much later through schemes like ajax. Its generally NOT a good idea to do this, because they can load up to half a second later. And you don't want to wait that long for page layout elements to load.
Any stuff that I do in java, would have to be loaded dynamically, through ajax, to the frontend. So of course, any database stuff I do use ajax for, but as for frontend layout, I prefer static html templates. 
Thanks for the suggestion though!
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:26:58
This is fixed, I lowered the limit to 3 characters.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:23:40
True if it grows past a certain point. My main US-connected chokepoint is that I'm using coinbase right now. I plan on transitioning to straight which is a self-hosted payment processor if it grows past a certain point. But I do really like coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:02:57


Yep, sorry about that. Outside of an IP-based system(which has its own flaws) there is no way to stay logged into anything without cookies. They're the only thing that holds state information in your browser.


Bitpieces(through coinbase) recieves it, but you can, and should, immediately withdraw any funds you raise to your own wallet. The upshot to this is that you don't want to withdraw too much to not pay your funders dividends for a long time. On the withdraw page, it shows a handy safety rating calculator before you withdraw (safety rating = the # of years you can pay dividends) 
Also, here's an example of the rewards paid page:


IMO, security comes from openness and accountability, not regulation. The entire project is open-source, and the entire SQL DB backend open and publicly shared and readable, so anyone can look through the transaction tables. I can't think of anything in it that's not publicly available, but in regards to that, my answer will be YES.
AFAIK, the other failed exchanges didn't post their entire code base, including the website. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:45:29
Were any of those open-source?
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:15:47
I recently launched an open-source Bitcoin crowdfunding platform this week called [Bitpieces]( , that has the potential to really shake things up in international crowdfunding. 
I think its newsworthy :) . 
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:24:49
How do you know this? Bitcoin regulation is still at a tentative state.
@_date: 2014-11-05 01:30:40
@_date: 2014-09-09 15:22:56
Sure, I'd pay some BTC for people finding bugs, as long as its more than mispelled words. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:32:57
yeppers, [here]( . I've added you as well.
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:53:22
As a bitcoin app developer, I just want to say fuck them. 
Even the hints of regulations are disquieting, because bitcoin is at such an early stage in the public perception, that US citizens might actually agree to this. It's being sold in the public forum, and they might win out. 
They certainly have the money to influence public opinion in favor of it. 
Thank god that the transaction processing network doesn't rely on any one specific country. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:54:14
Ah, I fixed this for the user registering, but forgot to fix it for the creator registering. Try again.
@_date: 2014-08-25 22:45:52
I haven't heard of counterparty until you mentioned it, but it looks really great. I'll have to learn more about it and how it works before I can comment on any possible future integrations.
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:36:43
Cool beans, let me know if anything else seems weird.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:31:41
Also wanna make a shoutout to another great one called [BitcoinStarter](
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:13:43


Small exchanges exist all over the place. There's literally a stock exchange based in minneapolis just for grains:  . You know all those ads for penny stocks in the back of magazines? Those are either over-the-counter, or listed on tiny stock exchanges.
I haven't tackled the legal issues yet, because its just starting out, and it would be ludicruous to get regulated before its even taking off. Right now, the legal issues are secondary to making the site badass.
More to the point though, regulation does not equal security. Openness and accountability do; and the project is entirely open source.
Fraud is a huge topic, so to combat it, there's these 5 security measures in place:
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:01:49
I just added the LICENSE file to the root of the project on github.

Hey Chris, name's Tyler.
I just launched an open-source Bitcoin crowdfunding site, called [Bitpieces]( , which could be a great way for you to raise money to work on this wallet. I'd waive the fee completely for you guys, because I think we need more high-quality wallets out there, especially on android.
Let me know what you think, but I'd love to contribute to you guys.
Best of luck to you, I hope everything goes splendidly with the dev work. Keep us updated! 
Edit: derp.
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:25:04
As for people creating bitcoin services, I'm one of them.
Name's Tyler, and I'm the creator of an open-source, international crowdfunding platform called [Bitpieces]( that's basically a stock-market replacement with dividends and all.
I just launched it a few weeks ago, so its still in its infancy, but let me know what you guys think.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:13:03
No problem, I'll add the license file to the source as well. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:14:20
I agree, this isn't as simple or straightforward as kickstarter. Its more analogous to a stock market than to a place where somebody is selling products. 
A lot of projects need funding that still don't sell physical products though. Research, community organizations, freelance content-creators, etc. 
It still is crowdfunding though, and I think its extremely relevant for bands and art, because a lot of times they aren't selling their content, but are touring, or doing freelance art, etc. If a band releases their albums for free, and just does touring, this would be a way to support them. 
Or if an artist does graffiti, or web art, or any kind of art that isn't sold, this is another option.


As with any type of investing, that's a huge risk. Right now I have [5 safety measures]( to prevent it. 
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:49:21
Thanks a ton! Let me know anything and everything I can do make it more rad. 
Feel free to email me at bitpieces22 too, if you need anything.

Hey I'm a bitcoin-app developer too! I just launched [Bitpieces]( , an open-source bitcoin crowdfunding platform a few weeks ago. Let me know what you think!
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:25:43
Hey, name's Tyler. Just this week I launched a really cool open-source bitcoin crowdfunding platform called [Bitpieces]( . If we get some good companies/content-creators signed up, it'd be a great way to draw people who want to crowdfund internationally to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:15:18
I chose to use coinbase for my site,  The API was extremely clean, the callbacks simple and frequent, and lots of connectors written for other languages(coinbase-java) in my case.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:02:59
I'm about to read those articles now. 
I do agree with you completely, A lot of people have told me that equity crowdfunding in this style is off-limits according to the SEC. Allowing funders to support content-creators, as opposed to regulated companies, is a no-no for the SEC.
This is the main reason I chose to use BTC instead of USD, so that the SEC has no real jurisdiction over it, and can't halt or control the transactions in any way, any more than can the financial regulators of any country attempt to control bitcoin transactions.
Right now, I'm using coinbase as a payment-processor(which is US-based), but in the future, if the SEC decides that equity-based crowdfunding in this style is illegal, it'd be really easy to move to another payment processor, and another hosting site, in another country.  We're not really there yet so I'm not getting ahead of myself, but it may become an issue. 
Thank you for your expertise, I'm just a software dev so I know nada about law. Going to read those articles now.
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:04:00
I'm the creator of an open-source bitcoin stock market, called [Bitpieces]( Its fully functional, I'm just having trouble getting content-creators to sign up.
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:16:41
You'll find that pretty standard among other crowdfunding sites.
@_date: 2014-08-26 00:43:48
I do agree absolutely that "bitcoin crowdfunding" will reach a smaller market than "international crowdfunding", which is what I'm aiming for. To try to capture this, Bitpieces uses currency conversions from Bitcoinaverage.com's API to convert into your native currency(I think 20 or so right now). The currency conversions also work historically as well(they don't just use the current conversion rate). So Bitpieces, right now, can display all the values in MXN, or SEK, or CNY, or USD.


This is right out. Being able to take bank transfers would kind of be like trying to open up a bar in your backyard; you have to get permissions and licenses from someone.


I'm not sure I follow you here completely, but there are many sites which do this right now: coinbase is the one I use to buy my bitcoins (converting from dollars to BTC), and to handle the payment buttons on the site itself.
I hope you have a good one.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:42:38
I'm not sure what the first one was. Bitcoinstarter was the first one that dealt exclusively in bitcoin, that I found after I'd built my site.
Edit: Hopefully someone more knowledgeable could chime in.
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:26:37
This is fixed now, I lowered it to 3.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:27:41
As the project grows and I can start hiring some people, a legal rep will definitely be one of them! 
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:49:13
Glad you like it!
Right now at least, it has to be &gt; 0 , but that obviously doesn't exclude miniscule amounts. So someone could set their reward at .00000001 BTC / piece / year. 
A lot of content-creators might not be generating too much profit initially, so this is okay. They can always change the reward later. Its at least good to have a history of rewards and safety ratings, no matter how small. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 17:20:05
Shameless plug for my open-source BTC crowdfunding application, [Bitpieces]( . 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:03:06
I've been watching these colored coins closely, and can't wait for them to take off!
I'm a developer of [Bitpieces]( ,an open-source bitcoin crowdfunding platform, that might fill a niche before the colored coins become more used.
I'd also like to mention another great bitcoin crowdfunding site, [BitcoinStarter.com](
Go Bitcoin crowdfunding!

Hi all, My name's Tyler, and I recently launched a bitcoin crowdfunding platform called [Bitpieces]( , that has the potential to revolutionize the way we invest in each other. 
Even outside of lighthouse, Bitcoin crowdfunding is really picking up. Another awesome site is  , which has a ton of projects on there already.
