There is a club is Vegas that takes crypto right now actually.

Same here!

You're right! On the note of Bitcoin's inherent value though...
They say the dollar is backed by the "full faith and credit of the US government". I say Bitcoin is backed by the full faith and credit of the people!
Which one do you trust more? 
This usually makes them think!

If it breaks even, why?
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:02:24
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:01:54
I agree with you, but I still believe the existence of Bitcoin as a reserve currency will help.
@_date: 2019-11-02 17:10:28
You're absolutely right! In the textbooks of the future, this will be seen as a key transitional period for humanity.

This is a pretty extreme incorrect assumption.
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:42:47
When they say banks, I think they're referring to the federal reserve.

Load the EXACT SAME Korea fud.

You hit 85% of mobile devices with an Android app, it usually takes priority and they push out iOS later nowadays.

Ah, cynicism. What a relief.

Only after 10k

This and Coinbase, also Xcoins.io.

6 figures isn't rich

No it doesn't. Spend a couple hours researching black hat methods and you will easily find 100 encryption programs that will successfully hide any virus from any antivirus, scan time or run time.

I thought the previous crash had a lot to do with Mt. Gox, care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:14:02
I feel like you're getting bamboozled my friend.

Paper wallet dude. Make a Linux pen drive and download a copy of wallet generator.net from GitHub. Open index.html on the Linux live stick and print to PDF. Encrypt the PDF with the default archive manager, which gives you 128-bit AES encryption. Not the strongest but still takes 5000 years to crack with a normal PC. 
If you want something stronger, I believe there is also an encryption tool built into some Linux distros.

This made me actually laugh, and not just blow more air out of my nose than usual. Props A+++. I'm in Psychology class.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:19:25
Was that before or after the Mt. Gox incident?
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:26:49
RemindMe! 1 week "check Bitcoin price"

Force you to open your wallet. You can be jailed indefinitely, yes for life, until you unlock it.
That is, if they know that you have the ability to unlock it. 
Best bet is to put an encrypted seed on a USB drive and say you forgot the password.  
Edit: Contempt of court, or obstruction of Justice is what they will jail you on. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:19:46
They wouldn't:)
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:28:17
Did I do that right?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:18:29
This is why Zcash is great.
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:27:43
This gave me an actual good laugh.
