Wow. Keep going. Damn...too bad only 5 people will ever see this exchange. So, you were totally wrong about what you wrote. I was unnecessarily rude to you. You still stick with your original argument, which is wrong in every possible way. And your new counter argument is that.... I am wrong.
Thank you America. Thank you so much. Oh...if you're still mad at me, please keep posting. No one will follow this exchange but it'll be funny before my flight takes off. Maybe write more about how I am similar to the crazy sect that does something or other with air and breathing.

How many square miles would it take, do you think, for us to be comfortable as a new nation? Would an island the size of Saba be big enough? Could we find 5,000 people to buy out all citizens there? Then form a nation with bitcoin as a currency and just a bill of rights as our constitution? I would put up $2million for my share. The weather is nice there. And the neighboring nations are stupid as fuck with no military... So no local threats.
Or...am I crazy and it is just too unrealistic? Probably...bummer...
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:19:39
Ugh...how come people are SO stupid. Read the original post. Read the part AFTER what you think he said. He was asking how to hide capital gains from USING his bitcoin for purchases. Income is capital gains. That is what he was referring to. Also, for the record, it is what I told you to look up cuz you don't understand it. Ugh...stupid people. At least your kind is comical.
Damn...is EVERYONE here an idiot? I feel like I just come here for entertainment. Like how I watch the employees at McDonalds for a few minutes before flights at airports...just to see stupidity in action.
And then you bring up some stupid California sect as an example of what I was talking about. Please....respond again. You're funny. Like the employees at McDonalds in O'Hare.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:52:18
No. Because he didn't buy anything in your method. My proposal (even though it was a joke...not a funny one..but still a joke) was that he waits til bitcoin drops (or remains at the same price he bought it at) then purchases something. Thus avoiding capital gains.
Your assertion is that I said to lose exactly half of his salary by gambling...in Vegas only apparently.
Your  understanding of written English is horrible. Or...you are even less funny than me.
Either way: good attempt. Just kidding. It was horrible.

That was such a dumb post. If you can't be funny...don't try. And if you're serious...you're an idiot.

Justify to whom? Does the IRS now require that we justify everything we purchase? I just bought bitcoin on this drop. What form do I fill out to let them know I just bought?
I also just bought a T-shirt. Where does that get entered on my tax forms?
No offense...but do you have any idea what you are talking about? Duck Duck Go about capital gains. It sounds like you need to learn the basics.

Does anyone else feel that these 2 idiots aren't the only ones involved in something illegal regarding the Silk Road investigation?
Like...MANY more people are involved?
This is the guy, I believe, who faked the murder for hire against Ross. He is clearly an idiot. I believe that he was fairly high up in the investigation. There must have been investigators who were smarter than him. Some of them, I would guess, are involved as well.
I wonder how much of the evidence was illegally gathered. I also wonder how much was faked. Lastly, I wonder how much the rest of that investigative team stole.
Apparently I wonder a lot...

Ahhh...my apologies. You are right. I was wrong. Enjoy your week and don't let my rudeness get to you.
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:39:55
So...it is OK to argue about what you feel it is OK to argue. But if someone feels like arguing something else then they are an idiot?
Well...duh. Almost everyone who lives primarily in front of their computer screen all day thinks like that.
Are you sure it would be OK for us to talk about the inherent unfairness of the laws? I kinda did wanna talk about that...but I was really nervous about upsetting someone.
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:52:52
I base it on statistics. If you have a group of several or more individuals (like the task force on the Silk Road case) and you run an IQ test on one of them (like this agent)...then the odds that someone else in the group is smarter than the one you just tested is pretty good.
Also, I do know that "smarter" is not the same as "more risk averse." I know this because they are not synonyms. Plus, I speak and write English.
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:45:17
I know what you mean. It is...like...so difficult to have to sit here and voluntarily read these comments.
I mean...well...you know...these people here are not attorneys (like you). They have absolutely NO idea what they are talking about. How could they be able to have opinions? They aren't lawyers. They never were formally educated on forming and maintaining opinions.
Either way, I can't wait til Reddit makes it so that only people who claim to be attorneys can post here.
I'm out too! (til I come back later)
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:23:42
I wonder if he hid other stolen bitcoins. Then he pleads guilty and has his lawyer tell some stupid story about how he could barely sleep at night because of guilt. He will have an easy sentence and when he leaves community service he will leave the US forever with his stolen loot. And...since he would have already served his sentence there will be no reason to investigate him again.
My guess is that there are dozens of agents who were involved in the Silk Road case who stole shit. I also believe that Ross Ulbricht was handed a sentence that was far too severe....which makes me feel that the judge and prosecutors may have also been somewhat involved in something shady with this case as well. Well....prosecutors are always shady so that goes without saying (sorry if you are one of the few prosecutors who is not shady).
Wow...I seem like a conspiracy theorist. But still...at least two of the agents definitely stole and one of those evil bastards lied and made shit up regarding the case.
Ross will spend his entire life in jail. These guys will probably spend less than a year. They committed real crimes. America is a bummer.

I read it. It was an entertaining article. Basically it's just another guy who believes in bitcoin and gives some of his personal opinions as to why.
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:50:20
Is it Jimmy from 'Seinfeld'? One of the greatest episodes ever!?
Jimmy could buy bitcoin at $458 today. Then he can wait til it drops in value (relative to USD). Then he can spend it on items. It will be a loss and therefore no taxes paid. No anonymity is needed. In fact, the losses can be written off.
When someone else actually tries to answer this then I will try to come back and tell you a way to actually do it...in other words: tax evasion.
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:54:18
I didn't read the comments. But I feel that most people don't get bitcoin. So the comments are bound to be uninformed.
Articles like these may get a handful of new users interested in bitcoin. To me, that is always a good thing. I really doubt that an article like this will make someone lose interest in bitcoin.
Zerohedge comments are extreme and often very biased. And lots of them really seem to hate Jews and aren't afraid to write about it. So the comment section on Zerohedge usually isn't worth reading, in my opinion. Unless you want a chuckle.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:44:44
I edited that. I was writing about the "pretty big" guys at the $7k price. Sorry for not completing the explanation.
I think about 80% of the compute power is in the biggest 10 players. These guys can mine profitably when btc is at about $2k. The other 80% are upside down at $7k....even some of the guys who built big operations (but didn't build it efficiently and pay higher rates)
There is a big gap between $2k and $7k and there are not many miners in the middle who can be profitable. So I am very curious to see what happens if we slide under $7k and stay there for a while.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:31:38

@_date: 2018-05-29 16:49:31
You just don't get it. The ENTIRE business can count ANY revenue towards their bottom line. My post was based on the revenues that the large miners had and how these revenues allowed them to pay off the infrastructure costs of their mining operations.
It is not "weird accounting". It is just that people in this sub don't understand very much.
You guys keep claiming that the profits relaized from reselling the miners cannot be counted. But that is probably cuz you guys aren't good at counting. ALL profits from your buisness can be counted towards your bottom line. You don't own a business so you don't understand this.
You claim that purchasing your miner for $1 or $1 billion. This essentially summarizes your understanding of finance.
What do you do for work?
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:12:06
Normally I wouldn't respond but you seem like you could be on the fence about getting your mind around what I was writing about. So I'm gonna try one more time. Also, you're rude to imply that I know nothing about running a business. But I will let that slide right now.
Here is what I am ACTUALLY talking about, if you ACTUALLY read my post: I wrote about the costs that the big miners paid and the revenue stream from them reselling their miners. Then I explained why they are sitting in a nice position and can still mine profitably down to about $2000.
You are one of the MANY who are overwhelmed with bitcoin and it likely consumes your thoughts (both waking and asleep). So when you read ANYTHING about bitcoin, you will apply your wacky as fuck filter to it.
Read my ORIGINAL POST again and tell me where you have deduced that I am clueless about running a business.  Tell me where I talk about speculation. Tell me where I recommend anything to anybody.
You didn't understand my post because you can't see the world without your horribly skewed bitcoin filter.
Simply put: my post was about how the big miners can mine til $2k and the medium sized miners will start losing money much sooner. You interpreted my post as advice on how to run a business or how to possibly make money.
I detail, quite clearly in my post, that this method of reselling miners worked until the beginning of 2018. But...again...you could not see this because of your dopey filter.
So...again...my post was about how it seems there is a gap between $2k and $7k for lots of miners. You interpreted this as me giving people advice on how to invest their money.
I guess...basically...sorry that you lost money in your bad bitcoin investment. But don't blame me for that. I made a shitload off of bitcoin....and I detailed it on Reddit over the last few years.. Now I just wanna talk about the stuff that I post about...but most of you guys aren't smart enough.

@_date: 2018-05-28 17:49:56
Cost of miner is, on average, $2k. Decay of mining is quite high.  Cost of electricity is not $0.03 for most miners.. so, the brak-even for the next year's worth of mining, at a price of $7300, is about $7k for one Bitcoin.
If you are paying $0.03 and you sold your miners then re-purchased them...PLUS you spent millions on the best cooling platfom...THEN you can mine until about $2k. But this is only about 10 big players (and maybe a few small guys like me).
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:34:16

@_date: 2018-05-29 04:08:07
Well, if your intention was to make it seem like I am full of shit then I guess you tried.
I am guessing you don't want to bet? 
Lastly, you sent me a link to the Wikipedia definition of "Break Even". Just for the record, it literally says what I wrote. The definition is when your costs equal your revenues....just like I said. But no one will go to the link and read it.
Here's the copy and paste from the link you just gave me: 
The Break-Even Point
The break-even point (BEP) in economics, business—and specifically cost accounting—is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal.
I love Reddit.

@_date: 2018-05-29 17:53:11
I'm going to try one last time with you. I fully know it is a waste of time but maybe someone else who is following this will gain some understanding:
(1) You claim I was exposed. Huh? Exposed for what?
(2) My ORIGINAL POST, if you read it, just explained the costs involved for miners to run and cool each miner. Then I explained that big miners also made income from reselling their S9's.
(3) Then I explained that this income, from reselling miners, goes to their bottom line as a company. This income made it onto their balance sheets. Believe it or not...it really did. Regardless of how many undergrad accounting classes you took...this income went to their bottom line.
(4) This extra income has provided a "cushion" for the recent drop in the price of bitcoin. The large miners are the ones who resold their miners...thus the large miners are in the best position, relative to the smaller miners who did not resell their miners.
If you cannot get this then you just don't get it. If you think I am making up all of this up then that is also fine. 
This post was not really for you. It was for all of YOU who may have needed just one more explanation of what I was trying to originally explain. Basically, big miners bought and sold their S9's when the spot price for the miners was really high. This happens in the world of business stuff. Business people will see an opportunity to make a profit and they will execute on it (if they have the money).
Maybe no one here has any money so they don't understand stuff about money...? I suppose this could be the problem. Or I suppose that I am crazy and the price of S9's didn't go through the roof. I suppose I imagined all the miners that were sold in 2016/2017 on the resell market. I suppose I could be making up the entire resell market and it never existed.
Either way, and this is a 100% guarantee: you can definitely include ALL legal income in your business accounting. This includes reselling S9's...even if you are a mining business. I promise you. And you can even legally use this income to keep the lights on when the price of btc goes down. Some people will understand this and some people won't. Right now, it seems like most people won't get it.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:58:38
Do the math again. Review your numbers. Or just go with mine since I already did the math and I'm pretty accurate. Don't forget to add the cost of your infrastructure for each miner. And don't forget the cost of the miner itself...

This post will probably get down voted to oblivion. But before that happens, I thought I would share what I have learned.

But you must calculate the costs to determine profitability. I don't know the costs of the 7nm solutions. 
Mining actually gets LESS efficient over time. Look up the amount of power it takes to mine and this will be the confirmation. The improvements in the miners will cause the efficiency of the overall network to decrease...if you assume the efficiency is the amount of power you need to maintain the network.

It grew, organically, from just a few miners. It wasn't one single investment.
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:23:26
What advice am I giving them, again?
Normally I don't waste my time with people who are not good at reading. But I'll try. I never told people to do this. I told them what happened. You are hung up on being jealous. Am I better at mining than you? Obviously. But that doesn't mean that you have to be so publicly wacky about it.
Again...relax. None of my posts were geared towards you or people like you.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:45:30
Complicated to detail. But I'll try again:
I am building a vertical farm in the desert. I have to build a lot of excess solar to make sure my farm never runs out of power. I plug miners into this power since I already have to make this power for my farm.
It costs about $8500 for the infrastructure for one miner, if you aren't already connected to a vertical farm in the middle of the desert.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:24:59
They just were. Not everyone knows this. But the miners sold for about $1,000 more on the resell market. And sometimes $2,000 more.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:13:42
Sure. I bought the miners from Bitmain. I used them for about 10 weeks. Then I sold them for about $1000 MORE than I paid for them. Then I bought more miners.
In one way, I am happy that no one seems to understand that this profit can be used to write off your costs of building a mining operation. But in another way, I am saddened that our education system does not teach basic finances.
Anyhow, this is what I do and I bought and sold (and used) a bunch of miners over the last 30 months. Since I consider this ENTIRE business to be under one umbrella, the profits from reselling the miners is included in revenues.
Also, this is what the big guys do as well. This is how their infrastructure costs (including the miners) are partially or wholly paid for. I know this cuz I did it myself and I told EVERYONE how to do it also. But no one gets it. Probably cuz most people are not good with numbers. Or everyone thinks I'm lying. But I'm not lying.

I never really take miners off-line because the control systems in the greenhouses can be programmed to dim the lights when certain battery levels are reached.
But yeah...good question. I calculated about 99% up-time when we built it. It does go down sometimes but that is usually from technical issues. Maybe about 50 total hours last year of downtime for the miners.

@_date: 2018-05-28 18:42:32
Yes. I actually did pay $0 for my electricity infrastructure. But my case is SUPER unique.
I was already building a large off-grid solar array/battery bank and the US government really does give you 50% of your solar investment back. Plus, for me, I had to build extra solar for my vertical farm but I rarely use the extra (except on very rainy days). So, for me, my power to mine Bitcoin REALLY did cost me zero.

Is this even for real? The best part would be if this post gets more attention than my posts. I hope it does.
Also, just for the record, why do people ALWAYS think I am trying to steal their money? Where is this coming from?

If the mods were to ban me then that would imply that this sub is rotten to the core. So I will not be banned...because this sub is not rotten to the core.

And that's why you're not competing against us. But you're wrong about your other guesses. For example, lots of big miners sold their used S9's for quite a profit during 2017. You just don't know this stuff cuz you didn't realize it and you don't mine.

So... electricity cost is important? That's your point?
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:27:04
I know...it is hard to understand. I don't mean this in a rude way. It is just that many people don't understand what is involved in mining. To build a large and efficient mining operation now, you must invest in some pretty expensive tech (or you have to have access to 365 days of cool air and SUPER cheap electricity). This doesn't really exist in large amounts right now.
People often forget to include the cost of the miners, the cooling systems, the upgraded power systems you must purchase, the land, buildings, etc when they are talking about the costs of mining. They just think that electricity is the only cost. It's probably cuz they never actually mined before.
Regarding the selling of miners...this is critical to my calculations (and also my personal business plan). If you don't sell the miner then you need to make an extra $2k (to cover the cost of the miner and all the equipment you purchased to support it). You buy the miner directly from Bitmain then you run it for 3 months. You then sold it for a profit of $1k and bought a new miner (then repeat).
Only the big players do this. Small guys seem to not pay attention to this trick.

This is not investing advice. It is a description of how large miners were building their operations.
You can't read very well so you misinterpreted my post. You need to read my ORIGINAL POST again. You will not see anything like what you are writing about.
My favorite part was where you tell me that I "got lucky." Umm...I was telling people the costs involved in mining and cooling. You decoded this as me telling people how to invest their money. My guess is that you are obsessing on bitcoin...and this is colouring your world view...of EVERYTHING. Also, it seems like you're irritated that I was lucky or something.

The govt gives you 50% and not 30%. Just Google the solar tax credit for 2018.
I use lead acid forklift batteries. They're really cheap. I don't have the specs of my battery bank but it's just batteries in a shipping container and the appropriate racks and wiring.
The time to buy this stuff was last year. Now the return on mining is reduced.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:55:58
For me it was free. For everyone else it costs money. I ALREADY had the solar because I needed it for my vertical farm. So, I am sorry to say, that it was free for me. M farm paid for it already. I just found a way to make use for the extra I was already producing.
However, for everyone else, it will cost them money. The original point of my post was to detail the costs of the larger miners relative to the smaller guys and then I expressed my interest in what will happen when these numbers are breached.

Each miner uses between 25 and 30 panels. Each panel is between 300 and 365w. The cooling capacity we have is kinda complicated to explain. But I'll do my best.
We have two different types of cooling. One is an older system using HVAC. We connect a mini split air conditioner directly to four S9's or Halong Dragonmints. Each S9 uses about 200w of cooling power at 208V. Does that make sense?
Our newer cooling systems are just small tanks with liquid submersion cooling solution that can hold between four and five S9's. This system uses about 10w for each miner. This is 24V DC powered pumps. And we remove the power fans from each miner (and chip them out) so we save another 65w on each miner.
Regarding our solar, we are a fruit and veggie farm so the solar is also integrated into this farm. Each greenhouse has a small area for 4 or 5 miners. Overall...pretty simple and straightforward setup.
Hopefully this helps.

The day charter business here is very good with only a couple cats that are large and in good condition. I want to have the absolute best boats and the lowest costs (because of my switch to electric). The Escape Room will pick up at the public dock and sail out 1,000 feet. Then return after one hour.
Don't worry...I thought about everything for this business. I just need the boats, someone to manage the restorations and then someone to be my capatin for each boat.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:28:01
Ok. But, for the record, I actually AM correct. You asked why I don't just sell miners. I told you that I make more money doing it my way. It is not "speculation" and it is not "economics".
It is a sentence that is factual. The sentence basically says that I made more money doing it my way than I would have made by just selling miners. This is simple to prove (just look up the price of Bitcoin for the period of time I spoke about) and you will see that I am correct.
No one is gonna read this far down into this sub. You wanna know what I wanted to discuss? I gave accurate info on miners and their costs and revenue streams...most people wanted to tell me stuff like my business idea that I am proposing to you fucking idiots is a bad business idea. Umm....does it fucking sound like I am proposing a business that I want people to invest in?
If you read my ORIGINAL POST do you see anything where I discuss speculation or the the fucking theories of economics? No?? Well, then why the fuck can't anyone just fucking discuss the fucking shit I wrote about? Why does EVERYONE just bitch at me that I am trying to steal their money or send them down some horrible business path where they will lose their life savings? I just gave mining costs and asked if anyone wanted to discuss....and this is the stupid fucking shit that I actually got in response.
Anyhow, don't answer. You don't understand what I was writing about and neither does anyone else here. I just find it such a shame that this sub is mostly dipshits. No offense.
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:59:28
Wow. You spent ALL that time to write out 10 unique things that I was "inaccurate" about. Here's a good example of what you claim is one of my many "inaccuracies": YOU CLAIM THAT HVAC IS EXPENSIVE. No shit, Sherlock! That's exactly what I wrote.
Here's another "inaccuracy": THE BEST MINERS ARE NOT MAKING $5 PER DAY...THATS THE AVERAGE. ----Ummm, no fucking shit. That's why I said they're making $5. Holy Fucking Shit. Everyone here is fucking stupid.
Here's another "inaccuracy" that you took the time to write:IF A DUDE HAS AN ASIC AND THEY STILL HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THEN THEY'RE RETARDED. ----ummm...how is this an "inaccuracy"? I never even wrote that. YOU FUCKING WROTE IT!!

@_date: 2018-05-29 00:02:17
Ahhh....I will help you understand what you couldn't:
My ORIGINAL POST was to detail the numbers that large miners paid for their infrastructure. You skipped right over all the awesome info I gave you (for free) and you focused on one piece of insignificant information.
You got irritated by the fact that I don't pay for electricity and this led you to tell people that my business idea is stupid. EXCEPT for one TINY little thing: I never told people to do this...I told them this is what the big miners paid.
Relax...also try to read better next time before posting a long response to something that you just made up.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:28:10
If you say so...
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:36:28
Yes. Exactly. If you read my Original Post, it details that the miners who bought before February of 2018 made profit on reselling miners.
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:34:09
You just don't get it. I am talking about net income and you are talking bout where it goes on a spreadsheet. I am talking about how the miners made money and you are focused on how they account for it.
I don't need a tax or business accounting lesson. I aleady know the exact cell in my spreadsheet to place this information. That is not what I am talking about.
Just...foget it. You think I am lying and I already know that you are having a separate conversation with me that is totally unrelated to what I am talking about.
You have, somehow, found a way to claim that the profit from selling miners cannot show up in any book and cannot make it into your bank account. Definitely makes sense.
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:25:03
Yes, these miners covered their infrastructure cost. And many are in a good place now.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:28:43
No. You cannot read. This is funny and sad. But mostly funny.
I said that this is what the big guys ALREADY did. You just can't get your mind around the past and the present. This is common for people who are obsessing about something. I am guessing you are obsessing over bitcoin.
I don't know how to explain it any more simply. This is what the big guys did...they sold their miners when the price was really high for miners. How do I know this? Umm....it is in the history of eBay just as one small example.
I am willing to bet you that I am not making any of this up. And I am not lying about my own bitcoin mining operation. I am happy to bet you.
But regardless of the bet (which I hope you take), you are wrong about your interpretation of my post. Like...almost as if you didn't even read it.
Anyhow, I'll give you 5 to 1 odds in your favor that I own a Bitcoin mining farm in the desert and I own at least 1,000 S9 miners or Halong miners. I'll bet you any amount over 5 btc and I will pay for all escrow services (this is why you must bet at least 5 btc). I will prove ALL miners are mine and mine alone.
Or just stop being a dick. Or...be a dick and take the fucking bet.
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:00:55
How come no one gets it? How can you read my post and think I am trying to tell people that reselling is profitable but not that profitable? How can you not see that I am providing facts about mining costs and revenue streams of large miners so that I can then engage in a discussion about what will happen in the world of Bitcoin when/if the price drops into a zone which could cause miners to turn off their machines?
This post was explaining how the big miners have paid for their infrastructure.
Am I crazy or something? I am not trying to tell people to start investing $50 million into a Bitcoin mining operation. I am telling you that some big miners also sold their miners over the last couple years and this profit will help them reduce their cost of mining. Also, it was a pretty big profit and no one even seems to be able to comprehend this.
As for my system, the entire thing is posted in this sub. Just look up my post history.  I don't post often so you can find all the details of me setting up my operation over the last couple years. Just focus on the post and don't read the comments (that's my suggestion).
Also, since I am trying to be helpful to you...could you explain to me how you interpreted my post to be all about the small profits from reselling miners? You saw nothing about me trying to share facts from a miner and then wanting to discuss how the price will affect miners in the near future? You saw none of this....at all? You just saw that I was telling people that reselling miners is maybe (or maybe not) what should be done?
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:55:07

@_date: 2018-05-28 21:44:07
Either way, I'm sure you don't.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:46:51
It does have something to do with their break-even point. You just haven't done the math.
You simply cannot view a mining operation as a business. This is common for people who have never owned a business.
You're pretty sure that I'm lying, right? Then just get me. I mean...come on...5 to 1 odds in your favor for a get that you are pretty sure you'll win. It seems stupid t leave that much money just lying on the table.
Here is another liveexample of how you are not that great at business. You have a sure thing right in front of you...but you cannot take the chance. This summarizes you.
One last time: mining operations are businesses. If my net profits from my business are greater than my total investment in the business then I am breaking even at any level. You just cannot get your mind around this.
How certain are you that I am lying? I'm willing to bet you publicly that I am not lying. What are you willing to do? Wait....let me guess....oh...yeah..nothing. Here is your big chance to get rich...no risk...and you're not gonna take it.
Lastly, since all of this Is Day One Accounting stuff...could you link me to where it is in the first chapter of Accounting 101? Thanks!!

It cost me about $300 per miner to build the liquid submersion systems. I use about 30 solar panels per miner and a lot of forklift batteries. I spent about $8500 on infrastructure for each miner (solar, batteries, liquid submersion systems, etc).
I am based in the US so I qualify for the solar tax credit. I get 50% of my solar investment back from the government. So I paid about $4200 for the infrastructure for each miner.
Then I sold the miners every 3 months back in 2017 for pretty decent profits.
Lastly, my real business in the desert is a vertical farm. My Bitcoin mining is actually just using the extra energy I already produce.
So, my situation is unique for bitcoin mining. I basically paid zero for my miners and my power/cooling infrastructure.
But everyone else pays about $7k to mine one btc. This is cuz they need to buy the infrastructure AND the miners....AND they'll pay about $0.11 per kwh.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:29:28
Oh...be careful about that right now...
Do the math on it, ok?
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:37:43
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:03:07
Yes, this is what big miners did last year. They ran S9's for about 3 months and then sold them. They ran them until they shipped to the new buyer. They also ordered new miners and plugged them in when they arrived...and of course they sold them 3 months later. And repeat until February 2018.
Also, I was never proposing any of this as business model. I was merely explaining that this is what big miners did and it has helped them stockpile some more cash.
Not everyone is gonna be able to wrap their heads around any of this...sadly.

Was I supposed to send them to you? I don't recall. Those who bet me received everything from the escrow guys. If you did not then you did not bet me.
If you're just curious then I will make an update about my farm in about about a month. I am getting ready to run a new glass greenhouse and I am integrating the miners into it now. It should be my most interesting post so far.
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:20:00
From mining? About $45k per week from my small operation right now.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:32:24
The "gap" between $2k and $7kis the difference between the REALLY BIG GUYS who invest at least tens of millions into infrastructure. These guys also sell their miners every 10 to 12 weeks. This was additional profit for them.
So, the medium-sized miners did not sell their miners and did not invest MASSIVELY in infrastructure. They also do not pay literally the lowest cost for electricity. They pay between $0.06 and $0.11 per kwh.
So these guys break even around $7k and the other guys (who resold their miners consistently and invested in the right space and method of cooling) will break even at $2k. This the "gap".
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:18:03
Just...don't sweat it. I do my accounting differently than others, it seems. It works for me but not for everyone. You kinda gotta take a leap (and actually do the math...this is the "leap" of which I speak).

Oh. You're talking about the bet. No. No one contacted me. No one cared. I got a death threat so I contacted the police. I was going to invite people out on the 25th of this month but the police recommended against it. And I think it is smart.
So, in case you were wondering, it turns out that no one (not even bitcoin publications) cared about what I am doing. This is how uninteresting my project and the 1,000 public bitcoin bet are to the bitcoin world.
I read a story about a guy in Vietnam who does about $150 per month in bitcoin payments for his store in Saigon. That seems WAY more interesting than a guy trying to mine off of his solar farm...and who also publicly bet three people a million bucks in bitcoin that he was actually doing it.

We cannot repay our loans as a nation. There is a point in time where this becomes impossible to hide.
In my opinion, we are almost there. Here is how I know we are doomed: I borrow under 2%. I buy assets (properties, etc) and I buy equities with borrowed money. I know that the money printers are loaning me money AND buying stocks. So...I know the assets I purchase and equities I buy are going up.
That should never exist. It does, however, exist. I take advantage of it and others do as well. We create nothing. We take the printed money and put it in our bank accounts then turn it into hard assets. Sometimes we buy assets overseas because of currency fluctuations.
Companies do the same thing, except they buy their own stock because if they dont, it will plummet. The FED controls the economy and the flow of money. Until they can't. 
We're doomed. And it will happen within 2 years, I believe.
I enjoyed the discussion. Let's hope we are both wrong. That would be nicer!

You're right. I was just in a mood last night. I apologize for what I wrote to you. I hope you will forgive me...I know I took that one too far.
And yes, I agree that many people don't understand the integrity of a good data center. I know it is higher than almost any other solution...but understand that people (me included) are  nervous of data centers because of the added humans that are now IN on your data. This is bitcoin...I am human and I like to think I am ethical. But what if I could steal $100 million  (or whatever they have) and just leave forever and live in paradise....it makes me think that if I would think about it....someone else might too...and then they might do it.
Anyhow, you are probably right. The data center probably does make more sense. Just....Amazon...? Ugh...So many people will have a problem trusting them, I think. The NSA has a relationship with Amazon. They do not have relationships with foreign data centers (at least some...) in countries like Switzerland. Wouldn't that be a better idea?

All major governments will seize gold, including the US. They did it before when shit hit the fan. They'll do it again.
Also, we dropped a nuclear bomb before...Just sayin'.
The governments can make bitcoin difficult to use. They can make it a felony to use it. They can shut down all exchanges so that swapping it for local currency is near impossible. Local bitcoin will help a little but no one will really meet you cuz it'll mean going to prison for 5 or 10 years.
So, in a way, this guy is right. But he is also likely wrong. Because bitcoin will head higher than gold. He could buy bitcoin now, wait til it goes up (which it will cuz it always has trended up), then sell it for even more gold.
I agree with you. Math is awesome!

It's like: they don't understand quantum physics or even string theory. Information theory...? Don't make me laugh. They probably don't even understand basic differential equations.
Can you believe the original poster actually posted what he did without EVER (possibly...according to your opinion) being in a "world class data center?"
Wow, the utter ignorance and stupidity of this "place!" And the best part is all the comments he got. That proves that there are actually people posting here that have not even been in a "shared datacenter." Lol....the nerve of them! And don't even get me started on these idiots not knowing (well...probably not knowing...because...well...you seem like a person that knows everything) what a "hypervisor" is!!! Sheesh...if only people knew everything that you knew.
How can people just not understand everything that you claim to know? So puzzling....
Anyhow, keep up the good fight! And take comfort that the rest of us (the "Superiors") have "got your back" as the lower life forms say!

Call the cops. If you haven't already, then I suggest calling right now. If they do not send out a detective then contact the officer's superior when they are at your house and ask them why a threat to harm two children is not being handled as it outlined by most States, by having a detective investigate.
Unless you are in a 3rd world country. Then I would suggest that the person is unlikely to be a real threat.

You feel that Britain leaving the EU is the beginning of a plan to create a new world currency?
Is there any chance that the financially disenfranchised in Britain and those who just wanted Brussels to stop forcing them to take in immigrants voted that they had enough?
You're pretty sure a group worked in secret to falsify a vote in a large country...And they did the math on the outcome of this false vote tally...And the outcome is that a new world currency will be implemented? Oh,and the Rothchilds are likely the perpetrators?
Seems reasonable.

Thanks for the link! The main reason I want to test this (on a small scale) is primarily cuz we have excess solar on our property in the desert. And we already have cool space to run this. Otherwise, it would be a big investment...maybe a good investment..but still BIG.

What are the poor people who don't know anything and are unemployable gonna do (like....30% of our adult population)? They're gonna be criminals, right? Well, they can't sell drugs cuz now they're legal. They're gonna have to steal shit. Bitcoins seem like they are easy to steal if you are a criminal and you have a gun. Just...walk up to some dude and tell him to give you all his bitcoins. Or, if you're enterprising then form a gang and rob lots of people.

I still love bitcoin. I just feel that this could become a thing if...sorry...WHEN bitcoin hits a critical mass.
But I have been in it since near the beginning. Lots of people know I own bitcoin. Cuz...it used to be worth Magic the Gathering dollars or something and that used to be funny to them. Used to be funny.
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:34:38
What banks  are available for bitcoins? Ugh...the bitcoins world is moving so fast I never saw the FDIC insured bitcoin banks. Can you give me a name of one so I can look it up the nearest bitcoin bank branch to me?
Yay!!! Apparently there are bitcoin banks now, according to you! Right...?
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:52:04
I know all that (not meant in a rude way). Except for the firearm. I don't wanna have a loaded gun on me all the time. If it ever got that bad, I would move to another country.
What I mean is: some people are gonna get their life savings stolen at gun point when bitcoin is more widely adopted. That's all. I know there are ways to protect it. Sort of. But the gun to the head and the creepy guy with the mask...most people will give up all or most of their coins. I would. And I am pretty normal.
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:52:35
In physical stores? Yeah, someone like Coinbase or Samsung or Apple-Pay or some other company will come up with a solution for retailers that is actually seamless. I have no idea how it'll work. Maybe it'll employ Lightning..IDK. But those are my guesses.
No one really cares about payment networks or settlement networks right now. Most of us care about bitcoin as a store of value. We don't wanna use it to pay for stuff cuz we are hoping it goes up...a bunch.
When someone comes up with a killer app for my bitcoin then I'll (maybe) think about spending it. If someone can come up with a way for me to use bitcoin as if it were PayPal and it was WAY cheaper and just as secure for me (as a buyer) then maybe I'll use them. Maybe...but PayPal only charges about 2.5%. Doesn't seem too greedy for what is basically an escrow service.
Are the "un-banked" really the key for bitcoin? Idk...maybe. But the network is too slow right now so it can't reasonably reach that untapped market yet. If two poor guys in Africa can use their $15 smart phones to transact securely with each other then bitcoin will take off...until all the African tribal gangs start stealing everyone's bitcoin by force. Cuz...no matter what we do, if we are the bank then we are easier to rob.
We need a real killer app now. Not a settlement layer now. If there were a true killer app then the transaction rate would naturally increase ("natural" as in the community will make it happen) cuz of pent up demand...not imaginary demand that a handful of people think will explode from the gates when some company finds a way to become the VISA of bitcoin. I can already use my Visa and, from my perspective, it is safe and free.
I'm wrong a bunch though. I have been into bitcoin from nearly the beginning. I'm a regular guy. Not too smart. Not too dumb. I feel like I never wanna use my bitcoins. I don't care that it takes 8 hours to confirm. I am not gonna buy Doritos  at 7-11 with my bitcoin on my phone. Maybe when bitcoin goes to $10,000 and stays there for a year...cuz by then 7-11 will have the app for that.

You feed them...by feeding them. Duh. Food for them is attention. You gave him attention. You fed him
Also, you criticized a pretty regular comment...and your criticism was based on his comment history. See...?
I don't super-duper care...but I come here sometimes and I see lots of people like you. It makes me not want to come here. Of course...the nice part about that is that I may not come here again and give you a hard time. So...good for you. And good for trolls...cuz without people like me, you can keep feeding them!
Also, you seem hung up on "trolls." Maybe...and this isn't my business...but...maybe let it go with the policing of the internet.
Or...just call me a dick or a troll or whatever and sleep well knowing that you are not as bad as someone like me or that guy that you think is a troll (cuz you spent a bunch of time going over everything he wrote...which is creepy).
This sub sucks. Cuz of people like you. No offense intended. But....and this is the irony...it is also funny and entertaining. Cuz of people like you! 
Yes...yes...I am a dick. And you are nice to everyone, unless you deem them a troll.
Either way, let's hope bitcoin goes up a bunch!

Which pharma stocks?
@_date: 2016-06-10 05:34:23
I believe P2P cash. 
For now, I think it'll be digital gold. Later, when the transactions rate increases (which will happen), it will be easier to spend in the real world. But building an escrow layer into bitcoin seems outside the core scope. It also seems impossible since a robot can't tell you if the guy I just bought something from cheated me out of my bitcoins.
The base-case for bitcoin is as a digital cash that is outside government influence (unless they shut off the internet...anyone remember when Obama talked about them being able to do that, btw...?). It is like gold. Gold is a pain to "spend." So is bitcoin. It'll get better, for sure. Gold will probably always be a pain.
But I feel that its primary value is as a P2P cash. Settlements can use bitcoin if they wanna but escrow is critical. Escrow is tough to digitize. If I wanna buy a house using bitcoin, it'll be a pain. It'll be a pain for a long time.
I say, stick to the original idea: P2P cash. Let the other smart people work on their respective solutions and they can use bitcoin to plug into.
My opinions,  at least.
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:30:28
Raise better people...ok.
That kinda sounds like the solution to this entire problem. Sometimes we are so blinded by the forest that we cannot see the trees right in front of us.

It's  a gun pointed to your head. You have a decision: give it to him or possibly get shot in the head.
Plausible deniability...that'll probably save you from a guy who is high on meth with a gun pointed at you.
Also, rules like the one you stated about "no one should know how much bitcoin you own"...where is that published? Does my immediate family count as "no one?" Can I tell my wife?
The point is that people know. People talk. Other people will know and they will possibly tell others...until it makes it to a guy who is willing to put the gun to your head. Maybe.
Or...I can live like you. In the shadows. Hiding everything from everyone. Cuz the rule that apparently everyone except me knows about says that I must hide my bitcoins from everyone.
Hmmm...no one talking about bitcoins also seems like a good way to spread the word about bitcoin! Oh...wait...I forgot again...we can't tell anyone about them.
Anyhow...I still contend that robberies of bitcoin at gunpoint will go up as bitcoin becomes more popular...unless we all follow this guy's advice and hide it from everyone.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:43:40
I wasn't talking about a secret attack where no one ever knew about it. I was talking about a fake SWIFT attack that was made public..as an excuse by the FEDS to say our money was stolen.
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:28:13
That seems like a blanket statement that you just sort of made up.
No one should know anything about you. See...I just made up a blanket statement.
Anyhow, I think what you mean is that we should buy stuff but only use it when no one is looking, right? That way, no one will ever know what we own. We should have secret houses that no one knows about. Secret cars. Our families will never know what we have...who we really are...what we like.

I am off-grid. I think you were trying to be funny though...but still...I am off-grid so I cannot sell back to the power company. Plus, selling back to the power company is always at a HUGE discount.
@_date: 2016-06-11 17:58:40
Alright. I guess I was wrong.
My original point, which never changed, was that robberies by gunpoint for bitcoins will go up cuz we will all be banks.
The key thing you wanna explain to me is that banks are fractionally reserved. Ok...that seems really related to my point. I get it..you don't like banks. Here's an idea: put all your money in bitcoin and keep it a secret forever.
Anyhow...no one agrees with me. That is the take-away for me. Oddly, no one ever seems to agree with me. My ideas are always stupid. Like...how bitcoin was stupid...Tesla was stupid...building my own house was stupid...betting $20k against Romney in the last election on InTrade was stupid...betting $5k that Trump would win the GOP nomination was stupid...buying solar from Alibaba was stupid...buying an electric car was stupid...shorting the housing market in 2008 was stupid...starting a vertical farm in the desert was stupid...
Believing bitcoin will get big and some people will try to steal it from people who have it...that is stupid as well, apparently.
I am one of those people who bumble their way through life, making horrible decisions...but somehow ends up being right...clearly through some quantum tunnel which turns every stupid idea I ever have into something that works....
Alright..I am done bitching. Yes...you are correct...bitcoin is safe from robbery because your bank is fractionally reserved. That seems to make a lot of sense. You seem to know and understand a lot.
@_date: 2016-06-11 22:14:37
I wasn't trying to be vocal. I am just an old guy who is confused by millenials. That's all. Don't take it too seriously. And don't take it personally.
And, to answer your implied question about my point: my point is that if bitcoin becomes a real thing that some reasonable percentage of the population has then I personally feel that "theft of all your bitcoins" will become a real thing. Like how it is becoming a thing that companies pay bitcoin ransom for their data.
Also, cuz you wrote it: your analogy about marbles and bitcoins isn't a good analogy. Unless you are implying that marbles eventually become like cash or a store of wealth. Is....that what you meant?
If you become a bank then you have a higher probability of being robbed. If I am mugged, I lose a couple hundred bucks. If I am mugged and they tell me to hand over my bitcoins to the following addresses and they give me the laptop and a trezor to type it into...with a gun to me....I just got mugged for millions.
Is this worth a lot of people flipping out right now? No. Cuz it ain't happening. But if the economy crashes and the social services are dimmed down (which many people here believe is inevitable...me included) then crime will increase. Bitcoin seems really easy to steal if I know a guy has a decent amount. It is easier than robbing a bank. It is the same as mugging a guy...but now you mug his bank. Get it?
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:53:29
Well..the guy who posted to me wrote that if SWIFT was attacked then it would be a reason for more QE. I wrote that using QE to cover a theft was borrowing.
I guess...you are saying that I am wrong that covering the losses with QE is borrowing. Is that cuz I don't understand that covering losses with printed money is not borrowing? Alright...I actually don't have a degree in econ. What is a better way for me to answer him? I hate telling people wrong stuff.
Is...and this sounds like what you are saying....is there any chance that you're telling me that covering stolen funds is the same as buying debt on the market? Ok...that sounds super complex...but I don't have the econ PhD so I am an amateur. Can you explain how stolen money that is covered by the FED is an asset?
I am not trying to be rude. I just feel like I understand this stuff...I actually make trades using what I always thought was my understanding of the basics..but people often tell me I am wrong and just don't understand the complexities of money and debt.
How would you have answered him? Is a better answer to tell him that I agree that QE may be unleashed again as an excuse for the stolen trillions? If so...wouldn't the QE have to be much greater than the stolen funds since the debt that QE buys produces single digit (if that) returns (and maybe some are even toxic)?

Wanna bet? Go to bitbet and set up the bet. I will give you 100-to-1 odds that I am right. Any amount of bitcoin you want, up to 500 bitcoin. Deal? Make it public on this sub too. Almost no one ever bets me. If you're SO sure that I am lying then just bet me. Bitcoin is perfect for stuff like this. But...I already know your answer. The answer will be an insult cuz you just posted something that you made up cuz you spend too much time on the Internet and need Internet attention.
So...You can have a LOT of attention if you bet me 5 bitcoin and I lose 500 bitcoin publicly. But...again..you'll just insult me then head up to dinner from your mommy's basement. Let me know what your mom made tonight. I am guessing Ramen.

Read my original post. I detailed what I was doing. I don't own a large mining facility. I own what I wrote I own. You are pretending that I wrote something else and you are clearly the one wiggling out of the bet.
Anyhow, don't sweat it. I knew you weren't serious enough to have made an actual bet with me.

I really am rooting for him!
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:45:52
I know. But if we become banks, then we get robbed. Even if they get part of our coins. Or maybe we get shot. Maybe the guy with the gun knows you have 500 bitcoins cuz someone told him. And he tells you that you gotta give him those bitcoins or he is gonna shoot you.
I am not saying this will happen to most owners of bitcoin. But if bitcoin gained more widespread adoption (which...it will...guaranteed...cuz we're not at the peak yet) then the number of people getting robbed of their bitcoins will increase.
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:25:14

As for SegWit...ok...no one is gonna read this deep into my post. But...here it is...I hacked SegWit. If I can hack it then someone else can.

No...no...no...they know about it. I work in a University with several scientists who understand bitcoin. We speak with people who have mentioned this to government officials and utility officials.

Regarding your solar farm...you should copy my idea. You will likely make more money turning your desert sun into lettuce or something like that and selling it locally. Then you can mine bitcoin with your extra energy.
Just my idea and opinion at least. Bitcoin is highly volatile and risky. Hedge that bet by growing something real that is easy to sell and has a good profit.

I love your questions!
1) We currently use a derivative of a lead acid gel based battery. We have a supplier in China that designs this and customized the software for us (it has a built-in energy management system...I will send a picture tomorrow or something when I have time). It is large.
2) PSU is direct from our DC power system. All devices (except the Internet router) are DC to minimize power loss from the batteries and panels. I think there is a pic of it in my original post.
3) Each fish tank is about 250 gallons. We use several types of fish. Now we are using talapia cuz it is easiest.
4) Nitrogen? I don't know about that. I can ask my plant guy if he accounts for it. We exhaust often. So nitrogen won't hang around long.
5) We can just squeeze one S9 into the greenhouse in the pics I posted here. I am going to test an R4 because the S9 is stressing the system too much for our comfort level.
6) I think it can work in many locations. But the desert is the best, in my opinion. Maybe some other place like San Diego. But the desert is still better. Modern insulation is expensive but totally worth it. I can cool this thing down to 60 when it is 120 outside. That is mostly because of the awesome insulation. The key to my idea is attaching a miner to anything that is already producing extra power. I happen to have such a place. There are probably other places that do the same such as busineses and homes then went 100% off-grid. Like mine.
7) It is just me. I recently started mining and I only have a few miners running now.
8) We don't have the licensing to sell the fish yet. We give it away to locals right now. One interesting thing about fish grown in this system is that you can actually charge more for the fish. The system is very clean and the fish are very healthy and usually large.

Ok...now I get it. The Chinese are actually angels. They pay the price for us so that we can have cheap bitcoin. Ok. Then how about being fucking nice to me since I am about to be providing you with cheap coins?
You're welcome.
Also yes I get that you are trying to save me from a horrible financial decision. That is not lost on me. I just wonder why it is so important to you that you let me know that mining is 100% un--profitable. I don't think you are a spy or anything trying to scare people away from mining. I am not wacky.

And bitcoin will go down in value when this happens because it will be illegal before that happens.
In my opinion.

We are currently running 3 greenhouses right now. We have one greenhouse that is being outfitted for just lettuce right now. But I have some info on lettuce, since you asked.
In our smallest container greenhouse we can grow about 1500 heads of small lettuce at a time. These take about 22 days from seedling. I can't give you the number we shipped last year. Sorry.
We do about about 11 heads per Sq foot (we are almost 8 feet tall). We also need space for the fish tanks. This takes space.
I don't count pounds. Just heads of lettuce. They sell for about $1. Some sell for more. We sell to end users. Not restaurants or stores.
We buy organic fish food and some core nutrients like magnesium, iron, calcium, etc. About $100 per month for this small greenhouse. About 200 gallons per month, I think, in water. Or maybe more. Plus the fish tanks hold about 250 gallons each.
135 Sq feet of grow space for the lettuce greenhouse we have.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:03:19
OK...That makes no sense.
Actually, if you lose a bet then that pretty much proves it. I am willing to put my money where my mouth is. You have no money so you can't prove anything. You can just accuse. Also, you are accusing someone that never started anything with you.
You are just some crazy guy that is jealous of a stranger and can't let it go. Like....REALLY can't let it go.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:43:08
I attached pictures in this post. It costs us about $250 per sq foot to build and outfit each greenhouse. And $350 for the smaller ones. This includes solar and batteries as well.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:15:56
I'll do it if you bet me. Otherwise, just assume I am lying. it seems like you are pretty certain I am lying anyhow.
Also, you ain't got no money so you can't put your money where your mouth is. So this is what we have...you bitching at me cuz I am richer than you.
You could go to school and get a decent paying job. Then you can clown on poor people, instead of rich people. Poor people are SO much more fun to make fun of. Trust me. Especially if your ego is super deflated.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:45:49
I'll let you know how it goes. I did it once before. Maybe I can do it again.
Wish me luck!

@_date: 2017-01-22 07:58:42
I am sorry you don't get it. It is pretty simple: you have to build more than you usually use for days of rain and clouds. So when you don't have rain or clouds you are producing extra. I scoop up the extra power from the photons and turn that into bitcoin. Then into dollars and Euros.

You should have done that a long time ago. Plus, there is NO way you will block me.

Perfect. Then let's just shake hands and let this one go. Deal?
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:53:59
But it might.
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:47:07
Yeah. You could save about 10%.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:21:12
Yeah. I don't talk about SegWit. I just posted about it cuz I was pretty sure no one was reading it.
I am a mathematician. Then worked in my field. Sold a company. Then went back to school for quantum organic chemistry. Then started a biotech company. Now I am opening a medical clinic overseas as well as several other biotech related businesses...one of which is this vertical farm.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:08:01
No one wants to meet with me. I don't care about SegWit. I just use bitcoin to make money so I can buy stuff, like farms and companies.
I am not trying to be rude. But I am only doing this for the money. Bitcoin is probably doomed. But until that time, I think it will be wild as hell.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:28:49

I can't use USAA cuz they made me work so hard to get my car fixed 25 years ago when one of their insured drivers crashed into me.

Umm...I already told people not to do what I am doing. Like...numerous times.
And yeah...I am mining. I don't have a lot. I haven't been doing it long. But I have done it enough to feel confident enough to post my results. Then I was ready to answer questions.
But there were no questions. There were just people like you calling me a liar. Kinda like you are still calling me a liar. Am I personally offended that you think I am a liar? No. Lots of people think I make everything up. I am used to it. This is why I bet so often.
I actually am cooling my greenhouse with air conditioners. You can see the vents in the ceiling in the pics. I don't super care if you believe or not. But it doesn't matter what environment you are growing in using this type of system will require air conditioning. No matter what. Trust me, the lights and equipment are hot.
And I know it hard to believe but I am cooling my greenhouse with water from the underground lake. This is really easy to confirm using the internet. Look up Borrego Springs. There is a GIANT lake under it. The water is already cool from years of being underground. You don't believe this but that doesn't make it a lie...it just means that you can't look it up. I am telling you: it is true.
I don't want to be some weird conspiracy theorist guy. But I am wondering if this subreddit is basically being run by miners. And miners are afraid for mining to go mainstream because it will mean they are fucked. It does sound kinda crazy. But also the responses I got here are crazy. Like...your response. Why is it SUCH a big deal for you to write so much to me and basically just tell me that you're pretty sure I am a liar. What the fuck good is that? Are you trying to save people from a snake-oil salesman? I will save you the time: ANYONE READING THIS...PLEASE DO NOT COPY WHAT I AM DOING...IT IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND YOU WILL LIKELY LOSE MONEY.
There. Now, what are you gonna post to me when I finally send evidence that is indisputable even to you? I am guessing you will still insist I am lying. Also, I am paying zero for electricity. How can mining be un-profitable for me?
This place sucks. I love it!!!

It is impossible to cool a clear or semi clear greenhouse in the desert from 150F inside down to 66F if you need to have little humidity. And sometimes the natural sun is not consistent. And often the wavelength is not the one we want.
Also, making a clear greenhouse is very tough to keep airtight. Possible,  but a pain.
Lastly, we have to grow the same things year round so we need to be able to control the light and temp all the time. It is very tough unless we do it the way we are now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:00:56
You could donate to them regardless. You don't need to make a point of trying to be funny by saying I am crazy. Do I seem crazy?

Good point. That will probably fix all the problems. Sometimes I forget that borrowed money can be paid back really easily when you get a new President. Especially one who truly understands the power of Tweeting. If you Tweet it...it WILL happen.
Thanks for the reminder. Probably Bitcoin is doomed cuz Trump is gonna make this country so great that making money is gonna be SO easy...which will allow us to repay all the borrowed money. He'll get all the fucking idiots educated and actually working in well paying modern jobs.
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:10:29
The solar panels actually provide shade. That helps a little. We also have half a foot of insulation on each wall. Very excellent insulation. This helps.
And we have a water mister which sprays 73F water. Then we have 2 small air conditioners on the roof.
This is how we keep the temp around 75F.
Oh, and we exhaust fom the miners immediately.  7 months are nice. 2 are tough. 3 are crazy. But that is why it takes 30 panels on each greenhouse this size.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:06:54

I will try to open one but I feel that the same thing may happen. I think it is the frequency of transfers and the amounts.

@_date: 2017-01-22 20:23:25
Wow. You are truly taken with me.
Tell me what proof you need to have you issue a private message me to that you were wrong?  I know you will never admit that publicly. But what would it take?
Are you anywhere near San Diego? I would like to personally extend an invitation to you to come check out my farm and its associated projects (which I documented here). I will treat you to lunch and you can spend as much time as you would like at the greenhouses we have. I will show you what our long term plans are. You can meet our guys. I'll give you a nice basket of fruit and veggies to take home. If you turn out to be nice, bring your clubs. We can play at Ram's Hill. It is a great course. I think you will like it.
What do you say? Maybe we can get a few of you guys who hate me to come out and see what we are up to. Sound good? You don't even have to post that you were wrong. Seeing your face when you taste my produce will be all I would ever need to resolve this. The only thing I would ask is that you are honest with me regarding the flavor of my produce.
What do you say?  I won't delete any of my posts. Anyone wanna head out to the desert?  The desert blooms right now are amazing. You will love it. I guarantee it.

It often the best bet to go with your gut. If you gut tells you that I am lying then that is basically all you need.

Every single device is DC except the router. Pumps, air conditioners, lights, etc. All DC.
Batteries are from a Chinese supplier. It is an integrated battery pack, with the management software built in. It actually sits outside the greenhouse because it can operate up to about 130F.without much loss.

No. But we have already allocated 10,000 square feet for a vertical farm, growing marijuana when it finally passes here. And we will grow other high margin crops if the regulation for Marijuana farming is too restrictive for us.
We have 80 acres in the middle of the desert...sitting on a HUGE well. We can grow nearly everything in our modern climate-controlled greenhouses in the desert.
But we always have excess solar, so I want to make use of this. Since we built our farm from bitcoin profits,  I felt it was a worthwhile project to see if we can profitably mine there as well.

Let me guess...You don't wanna bet, right?
Well...This bet is still open as well. I contend that I am opening a fertility clinic at New City Medical in Tijuana, Mexico once the building is complete. You contend I made it up. I will post my payment history to New City Medical and the contract for the clinic space. If the bet is large enough then I will give the biggest loser a 50% discount on their IVF treatment. We will already be very competitively priced so this is a great offer. Also...You will need the 50% off to help you recoup your gambling losses.

I trade bitcoin as an individual investor and they give me 30 days to close my account. I get that you think I shouldn't do what i do. But I am not a criminal. I get bitcoin. I like....SUPER get it. I feel that I should be allowed to profit from that. I am not selling drugs. I am not defrauding anyone. I am not laundering money. So...I wanna be left alone. I do not blame Chase. I just think it sucks that this is happening. My guess is that posts like mine will accelerate over the next year or two.

I was just so surprised with the posts I got to my project about bitcoin. I thought there were more people out there in the world who were into bitcoin. 
That was actually the most depressing thing about this. How come no one cared? How come the only responses I got were people telling me I was trying to steal their money?
No one is in this sub. That is the real bummer. It's just a few of us.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:46:49
I feel that you are the one wasting your time. But let's not argue. You think I am a liar. I feel that I am telling the truth. One of us wrong. As usual, I am willing to make a bet but I am guessing you won't. If you wanna bet me then I am excited to make the bet.
If you're not interested and you read everything I wrote then I just wasted your time again. If this were a game, I would be beating you by a lot.
Anyhow, you're a dick. I never accused you of lying. In fact, I never contacted you first. You contacted me. Wanna bet that I am making this whole thing up? I will tell you like I tell all the people who are weird: bitcoin is perfect for this kind of crap. You think I am lying. There is a website that will let you win money if I am lying. It is easy. But you won't do it.
Instead you will let me keep wasting your time by making you keep reading. Isn't it crazy that I can do that to you? Have I irritated you enough to call me out on my obvious lie?
No? OK. Now leave me alone. I am sorry that the answer was not simple enough for you.

I need people to help us grow. But we are well funded. In fact, this entire operation is funded from my bitcoin investments.
In fact, I want people to move to my town and set up their own operations since I don't feel we are in competition. And my small town needs a new industry to breathe life back into it.
Also, my small town is in a unique location in America and I predict that the land there will increase in value exponentially because of what they are sitting under and what they are sitting on...

But what I REALLY want is for all the people out there like you who don't believe me to also go in on this bet. But no one will...And I am stuck with several people like you who just cannot get me out of their minds.

Sure. Wanna take some pics for me? I can tell you where to go. Let's start with the Solexx greenhouse so we can get an idea as to what is visible on Google Maps. That would save us all a lot of time. And that is my land so no one will freak out if they see someone on it. Maybe take a pic of you standing on my land and a screenshot of your Google Maps location. Then the strange people here can look up the owner of that land and will see that it belongs to my family. Purchased about a year ago.  Maybe a little longer...I can't remember the date.
Do you know where DiGirogio Rd is? You can access the farm via DiGiorgio. I haven't been on the access since the rains so you may need a 4x4. Otherwise you can just walk to it. It is about half a mile from the road.
Let me know if you know this area. I can explain the exact location to you easily. Don't steal anything. We have cameras. Don't take that the wrong way...I was mostly trying to be funny.

There is a chance that this is the short-term future of bitcoin. 
I think that Elon Musk figured this out already. If he didn't then maybe consider shorting Solar City cuz residential AIN'T gonna make anyone any money. And that fucker has to know this. So the only reason he bought Solar City was either to save his family name from bankruptcy or cuz he realized that solar will only work if it is subsidized. And since the government subsidies are running out then homeowners will have to connect a miner to their solar panels.
I mean...this is LITERALLY the only way to save residential solar or we will have to increase the government subsidies...good luck with that.
But yeah. This is one of the future uses of bitcoin. I am a test case. We'll see if it works.

If bitcoin makes you a bank then you might get bank-robbed. Just saying. Maybe it's not an issue and this whole post is a waste of time. I don't know...but I feel like it might be a thing that people rarely think of or talk about.

Buy in China. Sell in America. Very simple. Bitcoin is classified as a commodity. I transfer money all the time between accounts. I have been doing things like this for almost 30 years. The only time this happens was when I started doing the exact same thing with bitcoin.
Maybe I am a terrorist or a money launderer and I just didn't realize it. Either way, I am glad my government seems to care so much about me. That is, in the end, all that really matters.

I respectfully disagree. Vertical farming is for real. I don't care if people believe it or not.
Growing the way we grow is good, not bad. I am sorry to inform you that you are wrong. I do not mean this in a rude manner. Just...You don't know what you are talking about because you don't know what we have developed. Also, many other farms like mine exist and are doing quite well. Google it if you think I am lying.
No, I am not growing pot. I am in California and I have another farm next door that I may turn into a farm for marijuana. If I feel like it. In the future. But for now this is my idea. And I am executing it.
Sorry that I was unable to blow you away. I wasn't trying to blow anyone away with my idea to add another 10% profit to my farm. Trust me. I was just sharing. Unfortunately for you: it was disappointing.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:09:47
I know...right?
But yeah, I believe in it right now. In fact, I believe in it long term (as an idea).  Have been in it since the early (but not the earliest) days. I have a solar farm so I decided to install miners with my excess energy. I am at a competitive advantage so I used it.
And I am sorry that I feel it will go to zero. I believe it will be an insane ride to zero but I still feel that is the final stop for bitcoin. I don't want this...I just expect it.
In the meantime, however...I am all in til I get the feeling that the world's governments are coordinating to outlaw it internationally. You guys all know that this is what is gonna happen. Don't you? Sorry to be the bearer of bad news if you didn't know...
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:11:10

@_date: 2017-01-22 05:40:51
I posted them earlier.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:51:19
It is my personal account. I do not know why they would care about how I managed my personal account as long as I am not commiting a crime. And I am not committing a crime...cuz I was never charged with anything...or even investigated.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:41:27
That is what I am gonna use their money for.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:28:15
100% likely. Also..."likely"? Really??? You are so certain I am full of shit that you were only able to commit to it with "likely"?
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:53:17
I suggest never posting that again. I mean....that sucks. For sure. But I feel that there may have been another solution to finding heat other than slashing a wrist. I work in a hospital. You can come and hang out inside if you are freezing and starving to death. You don't have to slash your wrists to come in and warm up. Seems extreme. Maybe...Drugs were involved?
Just some advice for the future! Also...just cuz I wanna know: how come you didn't "man up" and slice you wrists instead of leaving that to your girlfriend?
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:16:21
Then we'll face off...somtime in the future. But not now. Now we are allies.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:04:31
No. That is a terrible idea. First: it won't work.
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:18:52
I really try to maximize everything I do.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:32:30
80 acres.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:03:21
Current. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:54:29
Then come out. I am having a small group showing in several weeks. Or, if you are around some other time.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:54:41
We exhaust. And cool with well water and HVAC.
No. They never stop unless there are 3 days of no sun.
We need different environments so we need many smaller greenhouses.
Battery bank.
All kinds of plants.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:16:53
Probably everyone does. What's your point? I am a threat to society and need to be locked up? Citizen's arrest me then.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:41:17
Yeah. I actually did.
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:26:20
Idk. It just is.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:35:34
By working in the lab next to the guys who first told me about vertical farming and their research that was related to it.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:37:42
I am a chemist. I think it will work at the current humidity levels. So far I see no oxidation on the gear. But is has not been very long. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:28:16
I like your theory. Let's see how it plays out. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:38:44
For sure you would! 
Let me know when you're in San Diego. We'll grab a beer.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:05:39
No. They don't care. They would prefer my money.
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:49:03
I appreciate you advice. And especially your contempt of banks.  Send hundreds of wires and I don't pay for them at a large bank. A credit union...I don't know if they will charge me $0 for those.
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:26:28
Anyhow, read my post again. Then tell me how I can do that. Also, pay more attention when you read.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:43:51
I did.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:40:09
No one ever asked for records. And if they did, I would be rich cuz I would sue the bank for requesting documents they have no rights to.
But I get what you are saying. I think they were just told that flag accounts with high bitcoin exposure.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:48:33
We have excellent data scientists. And I actually do the data analysis now.
We are building many new things however: a system which uses the cameras to zoom in and outline a user's personal crops on their app; mining shut-down system for power use; logistics company seed to table; crop planning based on sales data and market data.
Also I want someone who wants to live in Borrego on site and run the farm from an operations standpoint.
Any of those seem interesting?
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:13:48
Maybe. If it becomes about guns then it won't be public. But I will still get paid. And video cameras exist so I can record the event.
See. I am a problem solver too.
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:17:32
I mine. Am I funny?
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:41:16
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:39:13
I would not rush to your defense either. But mostly cuz I don't know you. Your reason is cuz I am kind of an asshole. Seems like a nice thing to say to someone that never contacted you.
My favorite from you is the wiki link. That is the definitive proof for everyone nowadays. OK, a link from wikipedia is why I MUST send even more pictures than those I already posted here. Cuz if you didn't see the pictures I posted then I must be lying. I mean...It can't be that you just didn't look for the pictures, can it?
Now, here is what comes next. You will see the pics. Then you will try to find a way to discredit the pics. Then you will ask me to place a note in the pics to prove that it is real. Then that won't be enough...
Anyhow, you are also an idiot. Like the others here who are insistent I am trying to scam everyone here out of their money. I posted pics. I will post more. I wasn't really expecting people to be such fucking dicks when I offered some info...But apparently lots of you guys are dicks.
Is it cuz you're jealous? Or is just cuz you're a dick? Cuz if I am not lying then it has to be one or the other. I am guessing both.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:50:23
Bummer for you
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:04:17
Not really what I meant. But yeah...it does seem that you know about China and mining. So that is good, I suppose...
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:01:22
Maybe I will video it.
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:31:46
Yeah, no one has ever had a problem with that bank. Wait...I think I read something recently...
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:36:01
Yeah. It is kinda like going all-in on something. 
Ever done that before...in a big way?
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:25:45
They'll probably just bitch at me and ban me.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:51:15
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:25:42
I don't know yet. You asked me to vote for something.  So I am asking the same of you...I just don't know what it is yet. Maybe it will be to vote for legalizing all drugs. Or maybe it will be for outlawing all drugs. I don't know yet. But I need to know that I can count on you either way for the vote. If so then yeah...you can have my vote...in exchange for your's.
Also, I may cash in my vote request for you later and ask you to vote against SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:25:51
Sorta. About half of our greenhouses are cooled by the water-cooling system. We place the miner in a position near the exhaust to reduce humidty. No problems so far but I do think about it.
Got any ideas?
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:07:28
I mostly hire UCSD grads since I work on campus as well and know many researchers in these fields.
So, I have access to very smart people. It is unlikely that I would need someone from out of the country to replace someone I can get in California. Unless....are you amazing at anything? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:05:17
I guess I designed it poorly. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:38:45
Sure. Make the bet. I will buy a ticket for you.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:55:39
We think about itna lot. But we are mostly focused on high margin crops as well as staple crops. We can't grow trees. Only smaller plants.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:52:38
That would be crazy. Bitcoin is going to zero....eventually. I don't wanna be left holding that bag. I have worked my whole life for my wealth.
I wanna make money while the volatility is insane. And I will hold some....just in case a miracle happens.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:18:32
I am going to try to explain it very simply for you. I already have excess solar because my greenhouses cannot ever be without power. Ever. So I must store enough for 5 days in case there is a monsoon. There is a rarely a monsoon. So I usually have this excess power available to me. I have enough to run one miner in a small greenhouse.  I posted a pic here. Look it up if you are interested.
I am CURRENTLY generating about 3.8 btc per year. That will change.  I expressed that I felt my break-even would be 14 months. That is just my best guess. If I am wrong, maybe you can try to file a lawsuit against me or something.
I tried to explain that this was not the future of bitcoin. I said that I was using my profits from bitcoin to test this. I tested it. It seems to be working. I am building more greenhouses anyhow. They cost a lot to build.  I will probably buy a miner or 2 or 3 or 4 for each greenhouse if I can get that all working well. If not...oh well...I tried. Again...you can file a lawsuit if it doesn't work out how you want it to. Ok?
At least I am trying shit. And sharing what I have learned so far. What are you contributing here? How many people give a fuck about what you have to say? And if they give a fuck...awesome...at least people are talking about bitcoin. It's better than the usual bullshit I read in here.
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:54:53
I will post the location to everyone. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:25:49
I make a lot of deposits and withdrawals. I am a very active investor.and I have many vendors I pay. And many customers to whom I sell. I have been doing this type of thing for nearly 30 years. Now...bitcoin...and all of a sudden my bank kicks me out.
See what I mean? Either I am a criminal and they need to arrest me...or let this bank keep loaning my money to idiots and let me keep it there. Seems super simple to me.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:34:41
I do that myself. What else?
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:11:04
And when I post the proof...Then what? See...Your solution makes me no money. My solution makes me money. That probably sums up the difference between you and me. I make money. You lob insults through the the ether.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:49:30
So, in your biotech company...how do you prepare for acquisitions? Here is how we do it: we sold part of our company for cash. The cash goes into the bank. Now we have an extra $55 million in there (on top of the $5 million) to buy 2 companies and a patent.
Sorry to hear that you find it strange. It sounds more like you don't believe it. How would you have raised the money for your acquisition? Maybe mine was stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:06:51
If anyone is near Blythe, CA they can view our container greenhouses with the solar panels on them.
I have to arrange the meetings but anyone who is interested can come out there later this week and watch us build a new container greenhouse.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:57:32
They want me to take my money in 30 days. They will not do anything further if I close the account in 30. So I will do that.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:09:31
Sure. They can post here if they want. Up to them.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:43:56
Thanks. But I am not interested in having someone write something about my bitcoin mining. I am nervous about theft of equipment if too many people know where to look. This is a tiny sub. Very few people here even know where my farm is. 
Don't even worry about the "benefit of the doubt". That basically sums up the response to what I tried to share with this community.
@_date: 2016-06-11 03:38:30
True. But if there was some guy in a mask at your house. And he told you to go get those passwords...would you?
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:43:13
It'll cover you when your bank gives your money to some other guy. Or your bank will cover you.
But I wasn't arguing. Still...I can hire someone right now for $100k in bitcoins. I can give him the addresses of 10 people with all the accompanying info. He will steal the coins and place them in addresses I set up.
That is scary to me that I could that. I am nice. I would never do that.  I joked about it with my handyman one day. He said he would do it. Yikes.
I used to tell companies that they will get hacked and their data will be held for ransom. They told me I was a conspiracy theorist. I'm not. I just thought that I could ransom them if I wanted to.
Anyhow...maybe I am wrong. Maybe almost no one will get robbed.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:10:31
Another good question. We have a deal with 30 hospitals in Southern California. We provide weekly deliveries to a couple hundred employees right now. We have almost 2,000 people who have signed up for deliveries but we only have enough production for a fraction of this group. We are hoping to have enough greenhouses by the middle of this year. Hoping...
We don't really have to sell. Our plan is really simple. We sell for half of what you currently pay for produce.amd we deliver it. And it tastes a hundred times better than what you are buying at Gone or Ralph's or whole Foods or wherever you are buying, even if it is at the best ever farmers market that you ever found.
We set up a stand outside a big building for a few hours and people taste the samples then see the prices. Then they order.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:25:58
I'll bet any amount. From a Satoshi to 1,000 btc. But that doesn't matter because no one will ever take the bet.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:54:27
That is exactly how I feel. Cool. One other person feels like I do.
I really do belive in bitcoin. I see its value super clearly.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:49:59
Don't sweat it. I will keep buying and selling. It won't slow me down.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:09:12
We have a well on site.
Fresh water...for the plants.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:19:03
Sorry you were confused. Your bank can only insure $500k for an individual account. So, you need dozens of banks to insure ALL your cash.
It is not KYC/AML stuff. There is nothing that says I cannot wire money to an exchange. They are just nervous that I may be a money launderer so they don't want to risk having me as a client.
I have a Schwab account too. I like the checking part of that account. Chase is similar though. And they have the Sapphire card...
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:15:18
Thanks. I'll work harder on being more civil. Good point.
I think it looks awesome too, by the way! I just really like the idea of modern farming. I am still a little underwhelmed by solar. But I am optimistic that it will be efficient soon.
Anyhow, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:45:04
Ummm... That is the ONLY real threat to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:26:19
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:57:26
But another QE will just mean that they are borrowing to pay for the stolen money. That's a double whammy.
I say: it'll be a GLOBAL RESET.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:45:01
Probably that one. I am super lazy.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:32:09
I do have pictures. Been doing this for about a year now.
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:02:09
The world is similar.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:54:52
Got it.
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:59:38
I hope to have a Swiss bank account by the end of this year.
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:32:09
Maybe. Sklllset?
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:39:44
My bet for any of those things is still open to you. And anyone else.
Anyone else wanna bet I am lying about anything? I found people to do escrow for my solar mining bet. I am sure we could find others who are qualified to prove the other things you are certain I am lying about.
I am easy to get a hold of for anyone that thinks I am lying. I am willing to publicly bet anyone here. There are LOTS of people who will volunteer as escrow agents in just about any bet we can imagine. I will gladly pay the escrow fees for anyone who is serious about making any of these bets.
But...no one will. I found the only 4 guys who have bitcoin and hate me. The rest of you just hate me. Ever wondered WHY you hate me? Here is something crazy...imagine what you would have to tell yourselves if everything I posted were true. Man...you're so lucky it isn't.  Cuz if it were...yikes.
And I am giving you the opportunity to do this. Publicly. Here. Right now. For your bitcoin. If you are holding bitcoin then you don't deserve them. I do. I will do MUCH more with them them than you. Like...I bought this farm and I am building a mining operation that runs on solar.  What are you fucking idiots doing with your coin?
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:51:46
You'll see them. I am just seeing if I can get any other people to bet me.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:38:51
Got I. You are pretty sure I am lying. And I should also vote for SegWit.
Duly noted.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:26:08
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:06:32
Gotcha. Here is one we are building right now.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:15:00
So...if it turns out that nothing is BS....then what? Still cool and inspiring? Or...either way, I am a dick?
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:51:32
Everything. I sell it directly to the end user. You tell me what to grow and I grow it for you and deliver it to your house once a week.
Kinda like I am your personal farmer and I grow organically and in perfect conditions. And I sell it for half of what you are currently buying it for. And delivery is free.
I can grow from 44F to 110F in almost any wavelength, humidity, nutrient mix, etc.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:49:11
I can buy crack on the Internet with bitcoin. Who is regulating the bitcoin part of that? Maybe there is something I am missing.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:54:52
Great. How much time did you spend on my behalf for that worthless info?
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:58:55
Bitcoin can be changed. It is infinitely malleable. It can even be hacked and recover. No other crypto currency will ever be able to overtake it because it was the progenitor. And it can become the thing that is trying to overtake it.
Nothing scares me about bitcoin. Except governments. Maybe bitcoin is powerful enough to overcome that. Won't it be SO interesting to watch what is about to happen?
@_date: 2016-06-30 00:39:01
I have excess solar on my farm out in the southern California desert. I am going to start mining with my excess. Reduced mining at night, however, because my Lithium backup is close to maxed out at night.
I have about 120kW excess right now. I have well insulated structures (at R-45) and VERY efficient cooling in these structures. I'll let everyone know how it is going. I'll let you know if growing lettuce in these structures is more profitable...
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:46:03
Me too. There has to be SOMETHING you are unique at.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:27:30
Very cool.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:19:16
Idk. They didn't. And they won't.
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:12:42
I am acquiring. This a why I need the liquidity.
I worked for a start-up that went public during the dot-com era. That is, basically, how it all started for me. Then I went into bio. I spent 5 years working in labs at UCSD at the Super omputer Center and offering math based consulting services to biotech tech labs on campus in return for teaching me their field. Then  i started investing in biotech companies. Then I started one. Now I have a few biotech related business. I start them or buy them. That is pretty much the whole story from my last job job to funding companies. Oh...And bitcoin helped too.
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:26:41
Ok, just cuz this is my personality. You tell me that my idea is a decent use of excess energy but you also guarantee in an earlier post that I will never recoup my costs,  thus ensuring a loss.
You don't have to explain what you meant unless you really wanna. This is how I interpret it: you are not sure what you are saying.
This is what I think you will try to say to explain this: you will say something about how you meant it is a good "altruistic" use of my excess energy.
But what I think you meant was: stop mining. And now I am pretty sure you think I am rude. Just remember: you contacted me...not the other way around. And your ideas were not backed up very well and seemed to contradict each other. Don't worry...no one read down this thread so no one knows what you wrote me. Maybe delete it to make sure though...I never delete.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:45:16
They bet me that I made the entire thing up. From beginning to end.
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:16:31
Who is forcing this "burden" on me? See...You don't know what you are talking about. You view it as a burden. I view it as comedy.
I was being nice by posting info. You are being weird by posting accusations.
I will, of course, post pictures of my farm. And maybe even some videos. Will you rush to my defense the same way you rushed to accuse me of lying? I am guessing: no. Am I right?
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:32:44
Yeah. Can you find my farm? It is new. So you will need a new image. But you already knew that. Right?
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:05:53
No. The point was to show the guys who ACTUALLY bet me that I was in the greenhouse that they said was made up. The next thing will probably be a picture of my land deed to make them extremely nervous.
Then....when everyone can't take it and hates me so much...then I will post the pics they want so badly. Maybe I will get a few more people to bet by then. Either way, you helped. So...thanks, in a way.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:36:11
I am going to see what I find at the San Diego Credit Union this week.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:57:03
Then you are disinvited. No guns.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:35:17
Yes. We allow visitors. Next month is a great time since we will have several new greenhouses up and running.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:56:54
We stole the basic design from a project in the Middle East. It works very well in the desert.
And yes, now we can grow high margin crops all year. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:01:35
Maybe...some countries may allow it. What about Eastern Carribean bank countries?  Or a bank in a country with cash reserves that can exchange dollars?
But my point was that it's ultimate end point is where it is not regulated. Somewhere in the shadows. Like the dark web. And stuff like that. Cuz it can't really be regulated...otherwise it will explode in value soon thereafter. Why? Cuz if the governments of the world coordinate to outlaw it then it is cuz they are about to collapse.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:01:51
I am not anywhere near my farm. Sorry. This is impossible right now.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:48:16
We are sitting on top of a huge underground lake with water that is already cool. We use this to cool the entire farm.
When humidity becomes an issue from the underground water cooling then we use efficient HVAC systems. A night, we use our battery banks.
It is 52 degrees Celsius (125 F) during the day sometimes.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:28:15
True. But some people do that. Sorry...But it is true. Arbitrage is one reason why.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:12:02
We build it ourselves in China. To is just metal and glass. The lights are out own design. The software, we designed it as well.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:22:01
I feel that over half of Americans like Trump's speeches. You seem like you don't like him. So, it sounds like a little over half of Americans would like me. Not bad.
And now god must play a role in the saving of my soul...Cuz of Trump or something? 
Sounds about right from someone who just doesn't know much. What else you got for me?
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:00:33
I can't say. I am sorry. They are very expensive. The company was bought by a Chinese company last year. They made the panels for that plane that went almost around the world. Hopefully that helps. They only sell to universities and research labs right now. And their current product that everyone can buy right now is at 29%.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:53:13
I have never smoked crack. Yet.
But it might be a crack-head idea. Either way, I'll let you know.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:53:56
Sort of. We are very small now. I am always looking for that awesome person though. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:22:17
Well, he is invested in bitcoin. It would be silly for him to talk poorly about it. He has been in it for years.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:35:01
OK. And not creepy. At all.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:09:08
Oh...you totally misunderstood me. I was not trying to brag about my brilliance. I even stated my profits from it relative to my actual business (the farm). And they are low.
Does no one understand me at all? Am I so old that I can't communicate with this generation? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:27:05
We need a solution that can predict crop plantings to coincide with a growing farm to table delivery business.
Lots of problems to solve on the analytics side.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:45:12
Yes. Except one guy who refused but "guaranteed" to pay if he lost. I counted him cuz he was so insistent. 
Oh...and one guy bet me a $500 donation to charity. I doubt he will pay. But he seemed insistent as well.
But yes. I don't recommend wasting your time looking into my post history I will save you some time. I have a history of betting people bitcoin on this site and other sites. I have met several trustworthy people who perform this service for a fee. I always pay the fee. Because I always win. Because I would never be so stupid as to take an uninformed bet from a stranger on the Internet. 
You do understand that this is not possible without bitcoin. You people do realize this, right? Is it the killer app? Sadly, no. But it is an app. And I use it sometimes. How come no one ever talks about this? I guess they don't because I am kinda annoying. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:12:48
Then bet. Or show up with everyone else. Pretty simple. There is a free basket of produce...but it might only be lettuce.
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:19:03
Yikes. No.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:11:47
Yes. My way is better. Selling back is capped.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:09:50
Of course I do.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:24:17
I don't feel the need. I already know they don't belIeve me. Cuz I can read. It is apparent.
I am telling the truth. But that doesn't matter anymore. What matters to me is that I have an idea what people who are really into bitcoin think. I find this to be invaluable lately.
I am going to post pictures of my farm here anyhow. Because I still want to know what people think about it. Reddit is a free way to get answers to questions if you know how to ask them.
(If I were telling the truth)
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:22:43
Thanks! We will need it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:31:15
Actually,  I can prove this one quite easily. I would be happy to bet you that this was not a lie.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:25:13
Just bet him. Sheesh. I am sure one or two people here would be interested.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:10:11
Is that good or bad? Or just right??
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:26:09
I posted one earlier.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:03:59
Hopefully you guys will still let me participate.
@_date: 2017-01-22 20:32:06
Sounds perfect!
Just tell me what you need to send that $100 to charity. Also...and I know this is gonna sound stupid..but since it seems that no one will actually create a bet on bitbet....is there any chance that we could gentlemen-bet?
I definitely have the charity for your $100. But I would still like to make some extra bitcoin. How about this: we bet 500 bitcoin that I am not lying  (on top of your $100 to charity)? And I will do this: I will gentlemen-guarantee that I will pay you or disappear from Reddit forever. You will guarantee that you will pay me but you don't have to leave Reddit forever. If you don't pay then...well...you don't pay. But I will make this public.
And if the proof is that you must come out to my farm and see it with your eyes then that is fine. But we must find a way to turn this whole crazy thing around and we must become best buds. Oh...and it would be nice if you posted publicly publicly what you found out.
Does that sound fair? Is there ANY way I can lie my way out of something like this?
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:02:47

@_date: 2017-01-25 00:13:25
Oh shit...I forgot. You are that guy who bet me $500. I almost forgot about that bet.
Hey...you should show up to the farm when the other guys show up.
Alright. Yeah...thanks for reminding me that you are that guy. Ok. So what is it that you need me to do to prove it so that you send the $500 to charity in my name?
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:32:17
You're into bitcoin. You do enough.
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:10:20
Quite quaint.
I am guessing you have mined before?
And I am guessing that you are jealous that I was able to come in as a "noob" and do what you do. Oh...and do it better. Sorry about bragging. You doused my braggadocious attitude by being a dick.
Anyhow, you seem quaint.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:44:30
Put up some money. Get some of your friends to put up some money. For you,  I will give a special deal. 10-to-1 odds. Bet me 100 bitcoin and you will walk away with 1,000. You are so certain. Borrow the money. It is a guaranteed winner.
Or..just keep drooling over me. I am expecting to hear from you soon!
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:04:48
Bitcoin will eventually be outlawed. In the meantime, however....
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:43:33
I'll take your cancer bet.
There. Your analogy was terrible.  And it implies you are not smart.
I don't care if you think I am crazy. I posted here about my experiences with my small bitcoin mining project. You didn't like the info so you got mad. Now...Why did you get mad, I wonder? Solve that problem and you will learn a lot about yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:37:37
Damn...I seem impressive when you spell it out like that!
I never worked in the Super Computer Center for 5 years. I worked with labs who had projects associated with the Super Computer Center.
Also, re-read the post where you say I claim to be a physician. Make sure you understand what you read. 
I'll also bet anyone who thinks I made up any of these things I posted. Like...these links are all true, for example. Your descriptions aren't accurate. But my posts are true.
What a bummer that you ain't got no money. Damn. I could have cleaned you out.
@_date: 2017-01-24 03:36:45
No. Nothing will throw me off other than a flaw in bitcoin's fundamentals. Bascially, if miners can't make money then bitcoin is flawed. Cuz no one can mine as cost-effectively as me (except a chip maker who also pays zero in electricity for the next 30 years).
Or...If I poorly time the entry point into the rigs.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:07:43
Umm...did you even look at the picture I posted.  The cooling system is right there...in the picture. Did I photo-shop the picture real quick? If so...it is excellent work, wouldn't you say?
And yeah, it is an efficient system. Can you do better?
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:50:40
All exchanges caused a flag, except Gemini. But that is probably cuz they are newer.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:25:54
We use LED and other lights. They are powered by the solar panels. The sun is for the solar. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:41:33
Yeah. That is what I am trying to say. Make the bet on bitbet. Then...Either I put up or shut up. If I quietly disappear then everyone here will know I lied. If I post the picture of me in my greenhouse then you will disappear forever. And I will give your 40 bitcoin to the first guy who responds that they are even paying attention to this exchange between you and me.
Seems fair. Let's see who slinks away.

OK. I guess I need to go back to school and re-learn law. Thanks for the update!
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:42:29
My bet is always open to all who think I am lying. I will bet 1,000 bitcoin to anyone who wants to take me up on it.
You will soon be erasing your post. But if you happen to TRULY believe I am lying then just publicly embarrass me and also win 1,000 bitcoin.
Also, what am I lying about? I bought farm land. I am building a vertical farm. I tested bitcoin mining. It seems like it worked. I wanna build more.
Let's bet. You seem like you might be interested in this bet. Let's make it even better. I will give you 100-to-1 odds. If I am making up any of this then you win 1,000 bitcoins. If I am telling the truth then you owe me 10. And it will all be public here.
What do you say? My guess is you delete your post. Or drop another silly insult. For sure: you won't take my bet.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:56:20
Then I will give you any bitcoins I win from this guy. For the record: no one will ever bet me. But if he does...you can have them.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:47:26
I know I am not.
But...I pay zero for electricity. And I grow tomatoes. And I can use my miner as a heater as well.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:10:58
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:09:36
Umm..OK. you could just ask me for the info and it would save you some time. But I like that you are working for me.
Anyhow, get back to work. I am beginning to your question your work ethic. Make sure to send us the data you have uncovered.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:30:37
I already have all the bit coins I want to buy. I sold some and I am investing that money now. One of those investments was my vertical farm. The next one will be a mining facility.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:00:03
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:18:08
Perfect. But for the record, I recommend you focus on S-92. That is how we are zoned. You will surely be wasting your time if you do not look into this.
Also, you are surely wasting your time. But I like that you are this interested.
Imagine this: you come out to Borrego.  You meet me and my team. You are like...wow...this is actually EVERYTHING I would ever dream of doing. These guys are pretty fucking cool. Dan, in real life, turns out to not be the worst human I have ever met. I wanna be involved.
Wow...that would be crazy. That is possible. I am extending my hand, one last time, to you. I am going to post the pics of my farm as I head through this project. The whole thing may blow up and fail spectacularly. Or maybe it'll be a succes. Either way, I plan to document as much of it as I am comfortable with.
If you think I am making it up then you will just have to think that. It won't alter reality. Some people just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:31:25
They appreciate it. Don't worry.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:13:25
Of course. If we are in this sub then we are all in it together. So...I share what I can.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:17:53
The fact that no one else has already figured this out is what depresses me about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:15:59
I did. On my original post. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:29:19
Who said folding? Sounds like you said that. Ugh...I knew you would never be able to understand it. Imagine if you could see the polar image or ionic image or quantum-derived version of this from  the CRYSTALIZED data?
See...this type of stuff is not for you. And if it turns out that you truly have mastery of quantum physics and how to model it using something simple like CUDA then you know what I am talking about. But you dont get it. So you don't know.
And it won't matter what you look up on the internet. You either get it or you dont. If you have several years of physics research and you know how to code on a parallel system then OK...But you don't. So no. Sorry.

@_date: 2017-01-25 10:06:19
Idk dude. I am burned out on you. You were never gonna pay. We both know that.
Just assume I am a liar. You already are hoping it is true. So just go with that. Proving I am real seems like a waste of time.
I think if you go through ALL of my posts. I mean ALL of them..you are likely to piece it all together.
You said you would pay $500 if I proved my mining/farm. Now you want me to prove a lot of other shit too. Sounds like you are a welcher. Don't sweat it. I already knew.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:06:29
Idk. Bored. Why are you doing it?
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:48:54
Maybe. You do know that there is a decent chance that this part of my farm loses money, don't you?
There is really a chance that mining doesn't work...even when you have free electricity. Of course that means that bitcoin is broken.
I put my money in mining with my free electricity. We'll see how it goes. I'll share what I can.
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:02:17
Me too.
@_date: 2016-06-11 04:46:15
The reason that your hypothetical scenario happens rarely is cuz that is a gigantic amount of work and risk to kidnap someone for days to empty their bank account daily.
Bitcoin theft requires a gun and the ability to make the person think you're gonna kill them right then if they don't transfer.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:26:39
Perfect. I have a great idea. Here is all you gotta do. Make a post here. Title it in such a way that EVERYONE will want to read it. Inside this post, you have BASH the FUCK out of me. I mean...you gotta SERIOUSLY insult me. You know...cuz I deserve it.
If you are weak on the insults then it is just a 1-to-1 bet. I REALLY need you to lay your Internet reputation on the line for this one. And I need your bitcoin to prove you mean it. Also, I need your 100 bitcoin for this thing I wanna buy. I'll post it on here after I beat you. I hope you're not nervous. 
It would help if you made it funny too. But that's just for my personal benfit. So...don't feel obligated.
Then, you have to tell everyone that you will make this bet on bitbet or some similar site.
Proving it will be easy. You will need to prove that my family recently bought the land. You will need someone to prove that the greenhouse is there. You will need to see the water cooling system. And you will need to see the miner. Right? Anything else I missed?
My side bet is that you don't do this. I hope I am wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:45:40
Yeah. I never thought of it that way. Thanks. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:10:07
Sure seems like you are trolling.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:50:59
Or what? What are you gonna do?
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:41:22
I told you. You just made it so people will think your account is actually mine. If people look up your post history and think I am you then you had better be interesting. At least don't be weird...
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:41:54
Actually...yeah. You are right. I forgot to mention that I think the government will get into the solar business when the rebates end. By "get into" I mean that they will regulate and tax it to make its adoption slow while they also get paid.
So a home installer will have a hard time, in my opinion. How do I know? I live in a very liberal state and it was a pain to get it installed in my house so I could disconnect from the grid. This is why my farm was never connected in the first place.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:09:50
I never go to things like that. And I have only met one bitcoin guy in the real world who is cool. He knows who he is.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:00:00
I didn't work. No suppliers wanted to go though with it.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:41:30
Maybe.....we'll see. I am sticking with my calculations. Seems to be working out well enough for me. It helps when bitcoin inflates, of course. And it is exacerbated when it it drops.
But yeah, I get what you're saying. You're saying that no miner can make a profit. Got it. Cuz..well....hmmm....if it turned out to be easy then there would be competition in the space. Competition....yikes. That sounds scary.
You do know that my power generation for bitcoin costs me zero? And my capital expenditures for the power system were zero because it already existed...you knew that, right? And still...with free electricity and no cost for the system...still...I am gonna lose out? Wow...why would anyone mine??
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:42:53
Cuz I like making money. I don't LOVE it.but I do enjoy it and the money I get does make it easier to live my dreams.
Anyhow...that's why.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:26:45
Anything that looks at tiny molecules usually costs a lot. But if you want to strike it rich then you have to buy the tools. It is a bummer. You can go a whole year and still be negative cuz of capital expenditures.
Scientists are worth it. No one else can do what they do. Supply and demand. They invested in themselves...now it pays off.

Some things are different for us. We are DC, not AC. So we are more efficient.
We pay zero for power.

Sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:20:58
You would have seen the pictures regardless. I am not a total jerk.
I was wondering this, would it make sense for Walmart to add miners to their stores in locations that have worthwhile sun? Don't they have some kind of deal where they are not capped on selling power back to the grid?
What kind of project are you working on?
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:16:19
Some guys we met here who validated.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:44:47
OK. Well...Thanks for the offer!
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:40:23
I can grow a pound for $10. There. If you can't figure it out from that then I don't think I can help you.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:50:47
Is that even a real question? Mining bitcoin is HORRIBLE for the environment. I don't recall Satoshi writing anything about what he thought the energy consumption would scale to.
Wanna be depressed? Do the math on the how many kWh we are consuming globally each day from btc mining. At least half of the mining is probably done on fossil fuels. Then complete the math by calculating the mass of CO2 produced.
If you're not bored yet by the arithmetic then calculate the size of the CO2 bubble this would be at sea level at room temp.
It's depressing that we ruin our planet just so we can hide our money from the government possibly swiping it from us. Wanna be even more depressed? Use calculus and figure out what it is likely to be in 4 years with the increase in miners/asics.
And I'm complicit.

What island? Solar comes down to hours and intensity of light.  Sometimes it rains for 9 days in the Caribbean. If you live there you may have to connect to the grid and use it occasionally. Or maybe you live on a desert type island. There are some parts of islands in the Caribbean that are desert like. I wonder if they get a lot of sun all year..anyone know?
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:56:46
Huh? I don't know what you mean. I know that I posted about this a while ago. And now I am following up on it.
Now it is a marketing ploy? Sure. Miners have lots of stuff to market.  I make the best bitcoin. You should buy my bitcoin instead of other people's cuz mine is way better. Yeah. Right.
God. What is wrong with America in the last several years? Is everyone like this? Let me get this straight: you are pretty sure that you Sherlocked the motives for my post. And the motives are that I am looking for VC money. And my good idea for VC money is to show the VC's how many people think I am a con man.
OK. You're smart. You seem to come up with really good and well thought out ideas. I mean...Of course that is what I was doing.
After clowning on you, good naturedly, may I ask what you do for work?
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:11:46

I told you where it is in your PM. Let me know if you are really there and I will tell you how to get onto the land. You may need a 4x4 because of the recent rain. I have not been since the rains and they often make the road very muddy.
If you don't have a 4x4 then it is about a half mile walk from DiGiorgio Rd.
Can you do me a favor when you get there? There is a water shed on the neighbor's land. Can you take a picture of the flat land near his shed for me? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:19:30
How about I make some money off people who accused me of lying? Your way only benefits you. Seems kinda selfish.
If you don't believe me then just don't believe me. If you don't believe me enough to initiate a bet then I would argue that you are not totally certain. In that case, just make fun of me and go back to lurking.
Or...be like a regular nice person and either thank me for publishing this information or keep it to yourself.
How can I be any more clear? I never went out of my way to contact you and tell you what to do. Maybe do the same for me. Or if I am just that much of a fucking dick then fucking bet me. How fucking hard it is it to do this? I am offering millions of dollars to anyone who is certain I am lying. There is a DEFINITIVE way to set it up but no one has the work ethic to do it. You sure do have the work ethic to insult me when I provided info to a community that I felt would appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:00:48
Of course I will answer. But here is the simplest answer. I already had the solar and battery bank for my farm it already over-produces cuz I need it to for emergencies.
I use the extra energy to mine. So for me, it made sense. I already had the power generation. My farm makes about 90-something percent of the profit. The mining may or may not make the remaining 10 or so.
And I had to invest in each miner, of course.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:20:44
I am Jewish. And how could I be offended? It was just a question about if we're talking about bitcoin.

The desert cuz it has the most sun year round. Also this particular desert has water underneath. Bitcoin mining is most efficient with no costs for electricity and little to no cost for environmental control. This is why my method works for me. I already have the solar and environmental control. So I added mining cuz I had enough power to support a little.
Direct awesome light is the best for solar, usually. This is often why large solar farms are in the desert.
I don't use power wall yet.

So, genetically male but you are transgender.
I am sorry for hurting your feelings. Sometimes I am unnecessarily rude. Also, for the record, I saw an opportunity to be funny. It turned out not to be funny.
You are a transgender female? And you were dating a girl? This is very common nowadays for transgenders who have transitioned for a while. May I ask how long you have transitioned? Were you always attracted to girls but liked dressing like a girl?
Sorry for all the questions. I rarely get to talk to a transgender female... especially one who is interested in bitcoin.
Lastly, just cuz I am like this: I wasn't accusing "her" of drugs. I just assumed it cuz it was so crazy. And...still...She could have gone somewhere to get warm without cutting her wrists...but let's just let that one go.

No. They cannot. Not those papers at least. Don't worry. Just assume I am lying. It will be much easier for you.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:56:08
I daytrade bitcoin. I am not a terrorist. Just make bitcoin illegal and this will all be much easier for me...Cuz then I will stop.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:55:06
We already had the equioment. The vertical farm is the primary business. The bitcoin mining is just making use of the excess energy.

You do know that I wasn't asking anything, right? I was just sharing what happened.
Also, it seems like you looked up what the abbreviation means. Nice work! But I am not laundering money and there is no federal case that was opened. So...No...Even though you looked up what AML means....Still...It is not relevant to what I wrote.
But still...Thanks for contributing.

But....just for the record: what would happen to me if it happened? Also...I condone it. A few others here would surely condone it. Or, do you mean that asking someone on one sub to post on another is actually written down as a rule and not allowed? Cuz...Often I have people telling me to post something on another sub as well.

I don't know how to explain this but I am gonna waste some time trying. I model proteins using quantum calculations and a combo of other waveform analysis on the entire protein or a side chain of that protein. Many people think this fingerprint is a waste? Maybe it is...We will see.
You need to understand the quantum aspects of those 14 or so organic atoms in order to write the code to analyze it. You need to understand how to code in parallel cuz the amount of computations is quite large. So having a PhD in math is also helpful.
I know you don't get it. And you don't care but maybe someone else reads this and they get it.

OK. I will check this out. I need to move my funds from Chase anyhow.
Wells Fargo is gonna have a bank run. My buddy was the VP of that dept that was busted. He says the entire bank is like that. He says big accounts are fleeing Wells like crazy.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:40:39
Or the other thing...The one where I bet you that you were wrong but you are too nervous to take it that far. But not nervous enough to keep insisting I am lying.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:31:42
Well...Yeah..that is my farm. So that is why I posted pictures of the greenhouse. Duh. And yeah...that is basically what it is.
The other stuff...Those are just your personal issues with me.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:15:52
Definitely. But...since this is a public forum and I did earn my first 1,000 bitcoin by betting someone many years ago...I will offer you the same opportunity. Wanna bet me 1,000 bitcoin that I am not lying.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:05:36
Ummm..if a con man asks you to bet him and you know the answer...then bet him. There is no scam in the world that trumps the truth.
So...I guess I respectfully disagree. I mostly disagree because I am not a con man. Also...I never asked anyone for money. People accused me of lying and I saw an opportunity to take their money and prove I was not lying. That is human nature. If you disagree with that then perhaps you have evolved.
You are on the fence as to whether I am a con man. I am guessing if I win you over to my side you will feel scammed. So...just assume I am the kind of person who is evil, lies, and steals money from strangers (that is what a con man is, by the way..just you were too afraid to call me that). Seems like the correct conclusion to come to, based on my original post. Read it again...just to reconfirm that I am basically the devil.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:31:07

What am I scamming from you, again?
@_date: 2017-01-22 22:56:09
Look..You have to know by now that you are gonna lose some money to me. Or at least some internet points. I feel like we should gentlemn-bet a negligible bitcoin amount. You were a dick to me. Without ANY provocation. You're DEFINITELY gonna donate that $500 in my name. But I also want a permanent digital record of this. Let's also bet one Satoshi. Deal?
Some guy here told me he is near the farm. Let's have him take some pics and we'll start by proving the greenhouse that is there and that I own the land. If that is not enough then come out and see the farm. Or come up with another way to prove it. But you GOTTA bet me at least one Satoshi. And we need to make a new post immediately upon your acceptance of this bet. Lots of people here dislike me. Trust me when I tell you that everyone here will be interested in the outcome of this. Let's give them a show. But let's exchange that one Satoshi so that it is recorded forever.
Come on...This is a very simple deal. I fully expect you to welch and I won't even clown on you for it...Cuz I expect it.
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:56:49
Yeah. You can. They cannot request your business records without a warrant. And...They won't request it. The feds will.
You are wrong. But don't sweat it. I happen to know this cuz I went through it about 10 years ago. I was unable to sue because I had no provable losses and the business was very small. But the bank cannot secretly view your records without a warrant. I know this cuz it happened to me.
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:09:59
Thanks! I'll take it. Like how the 1% took most of your shit...you just gave it to us.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:26:59
Fair enough. They will just borrow for zero and loan out for zero. They don't need my money.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:05:25
Let me know when the bet is set up. Til then, you are just another guy who is into me. I often wonder what it is about me that attracts people like you. Wanna tell me? Don't worry, no one ever does.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:00:22
They correct it by viewing the data manually. But they have to invest man hours into it. My account is not worth enough to them to keep it.

Yeah, actually. Buy from a supplier in China. Find them on Alibaba. Build it yourself. Use Mexican labor if you can. Don't tell Trump.

This is our smallest greenhouse:
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:26:02
I know. Thanks. 
I mean...I don't know about the conspiracy theory stuff. But I know my idea is decent!
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:15:39
We have different setups fod each greenhouse. So they are all different with energy requirements.  The smallest one takes about thirty 300-ish watt panels and a battery bank to support days of use in low sun.
Yes, we spend a lot of power on cooling. We cool with well water and also have HVAC in each unit. You can see where this is in some of the pictures.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:11:22
Exactly. This is what I expected.
You're welcome, by the way for my post about an idea I had about bitcoin. I had an idea. I posted it months ago. I followed up on that idea and posted the results. 
Posts like your's are what I will get.
I am not trying to be hard on you personally. I am just using your post as an example of the bitcoin community.
So..I can't post here anymore cuz you don't want me to? And my favorite part of your post is where you spend time telling me that it isn't worth your time. People are the best, aren't they?
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:16:06
Maybe don't let my post push you too hard to giving up on fiat. You do know that there is a HIGH likelihood bitcoin will be outlawed in 1st world countries, right? So dont get too riled up and cash in all your cash for bitcoin.
Also...if it turns out that you should have turned all your cash to bitcoin then don't be mad at me cuz you didnt.
But yeah. It is super annoying that my cash isn't mine especially since I am not a crook. One day, some of my money will be seized. I am mentally and financially prepared for it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:07:17
Going to jail will keep them from doing it. I don't live in fear. Ever. This also helps. No one here is real. That helps the most.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:38:47
Obviously. I photo-shopped them all. You know...So I could scam everyone here outta their money.
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:03:30
Never said I majored in it. You said that. Major? That sounds like undergrad. We are on a different level than you.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:21:49
It was me and a few guys from UCSD. We have been working on the plans for over a year. I bought the land about a year ago.
We are very small.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:26:24
Oh. Yeah. I was answering his question about break-even at that moment based on real time data.
Then I answered what I felt it would be in a later post.
You seem like a tough grader, if you consider that backpedaling. Sorry I kinda let you down. For the record: my answers were 100% accurate. Look it up if you don't believe me.
@_date: 2017-01-12 01:24:45
Today was ESPECIALLY positive.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:48:37
We are actually measuring 31%. These panels come from a manufacturer in Taiwan. The manufacturer was from a contact from a researcher on campus. These panels are expensive and we only use them for testing. We have a solar array from various panel manufacturers for our farm. We buy container quantities so we get a decent overall price.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:24:28
No one is ever gonna bet me. So let's not even waste our time with escrow.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:23:25
Good point. Back to work then. The community appreciates your efforts to protect them from harm.
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:05:00
It is a mistake. It is a disaster waiting to happen.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:24:21
Not a lot of money. Maybe $1 million in bitcoin-related transfers of money through Chase this past year. Lots of small transfers though. They wire at no charge so that is why I use them.
That really is the whole story. I really am not a criminal. I don't launder money. Every penny is accountable and visible/available for government seizure right now, if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:34:07
I know. That is what I am trying to say. There are barely any REAL people here.
This is bitcoin. FYI.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:07:20
I just like winning for some reason. Not against everyone. Just against people who need it.
So, yeah, if you're serious then I'll bet you 20 bitcoins that I have a small vertical farm out in the Southern California desert. And it is powered via solar. Like I said before, I will bet anyone.
We can gentlemen-bet or put it on bitbet. I prefer a legitimate bet but I will take an Internet handshake. I will not expect to get paid in anything other than Internet points for those who take that version of the bet.
Also, just because I like to try to explain how bizarre I feel this whole thing is...let me summarize what just happened: I told this subreddit that I am thinking about doing this on my farm. Then I did it. Then, months later, I followed up and I told people how it went. Then lots of people called me a liar.
Anyhow, yeah, let's bet 20 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:29:54
Just believe. How about this...? You believe in bitcoin, right? Of course you do.
The odds that I am pulling off what I am claiming I am currently working on are VERY low, apparently. Right? Just go off of the overall tone of comments regarding me. So they are low odds. Obviously.
Now, if Dan turns out to be pulling off what he claims...then just imagine how likely it is that bitcoin will be INFINITELY MORE successful than some weird guy from the Internet who is making outrageous (apparently) claims about a real-world use for bitcoin.
If you believe in me...just wait til what you are going to reap by your belief in bitcoin.
Our big solar farm is a partnership with a few farms east of Borrego. Borrego is my farm personally. And I hope to make it a Winter home as well.

I have built many of these. This is just the current one. I am at the facilty where we build them. It is near Blythe, CA. Someone asked me to take a picture of my greenhouse I am building. So I did.
Now they are shitting their pants and you are still weird, but at least you didn't put any money where you mouth was.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:11:58
I turn everything into money. Not trying to be arrogant or funny. That is what I do. That is how I think.
And of course I didn't go in with that angle. Read my original post again. It is pretty clear that I just wanted to discuss what I had been doing and share some of what I had learned.
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:59:48
Also...most people will think you are me. So...understand what you signed up for. I will give you the best basket of produce that I can put together for you!
I am curious to know your opinion of our location as well. I am planning to build a house on this first location you will be visiting. Maybe take some pictures of the land and surrounding mountains so people here can also see how beautiful Borrego Springs is. I feel that very few people have ever heard of it. And since you're there...maybe take some photos of the desert blooms that are happening right now.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:33:35
We have a very efficient system. We worked very hard to design it. We use very efficient solar panels that we source from China.
We are looking to transition to lithium soon. 
Our larger greenhouses use a solar array that is very large. Our smaller greenhouses have the solar panels on the exterior (like the picture I included).

1,000 in escrow. 300 on a personal bet.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:27:36
Agreed. And maybe there will a better overall mining solution for my setup later on.
But basically this is all just based on hope that bitcoin goes up a bunch...otherwise my bitcoin earnings will evaporate in the desert.

Feel free. We are in Borrego Springs. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:29:40
Sorry. It is hackable. I believe people know this. Regardless of whether it is hackable, it will never be implemented. My guess is cuz others know it is at risk...Maybe I am wrong.
How come it hasn't been implemented yet? Ever really think of that? Either way, don't worry about what some random guy on the internet wrote. He is probably making it up. Look up his old posts. They are likely peppered with false stuff.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:25:15
Who am I scamming? You forgot about that part of your accusation.
Also...I actually was right. Read it again if you don't believe me.
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:04:53
For the record,  my "crusade" was just trying to share with the community. Later on, it turned into a way to make a million bucks. Sorry you were unable to come up with a better idea.

Then my father and I will consume you.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:33:49
For the record: bitcoin is the OPPOSITE of "sustainability."
It coughs up so much carbon dioxide and other shitty particles. Even wasting time by building solar panels and mining lithium is a complete waste in regards to bitcoin. Those resources should be going towards WAY more important shit than internet money.
But that's just me. And I actually get what you are saying. At least solar doesn't totally destroy the planet. Making those panels and batteries might, though...
And what is wrong with betting someone? When did that become evil? You do know that this is one of the actual applications for bitcoin, don't you?
Anyhow, you're welcome. And I will post info about my farm/mining operation. I am just significantly less motivated to share much here because very few people are here and the few who are...are fucking weird. (Not saying "you" so don't take that personally).
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:24:18
I don't know what that means. I will bet 1,000 bitcoin. I don't have 40,000. And I don't know what 40,00 means. Is that European for 40?
If so...You are only worth 40 bitcoins? Weak. But yeah, I'll gladly take your 40 bitcoins. Put the bet on bitbet. Post it here when you have it live. Lots of people here will follow it.
Just for the record...You will never actually bet me. But if anyone else wants to bet me then let's get it started.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:17:03

I like the story.
I thought about vertical farming for a while too. Then I met the scientists working on it and we went from dreaming about it to actually building it.
You don't need a 90 foot tall tower. You can build a system yourself for very little and start making money right away. You can do it on the weekends and if it turns out that you love it, you can turn it into a business. Just grow lettuce and sell it locally. You can make $100k per year easily with little invested. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:58:00

@_date: 2017-01-24 20:15:49

But thank you. It actually does mean a lot that someone would feel compelled to reach out and tell me that. So...thanks again.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:53:10
We currently use modern lead acid derivative batteries. We will transition to lithium sometime this year for newer installations.
All equipment is DC so we need no inverters for the farm equipment. The bitcoin miners are DC originally had that saves us power as well.
We have about 25 different and unique environments so that we can grow pretty much any type of plant. This is why we build a large number of smaller greenhouses. We need to grow some things in cold conditions and other things in bed hot and humid conditions.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:49:49
I know.  Cuz it is my new greenhouse that I am currently building. Someone people asked me to prove I have a solar powered greenhouse. So I posted the pic of the one that I am at this morning. Then they said they needed me to put a sign in front of the camera and take the same pic. So I did.
Next, they want to see the deed to my land and confirm the date it was purchased. Then they need to meet with my accountant to review my purchases for equipment. Then I get my bitcoin from them.
I will post pics of my on-going project for those interested. I feel that if one nice person in this community (that's me, by the way...I am the nice guy who is giving everyone this info just cuz he is THAT into bitcoin) can contribute some potentially useful information about a valid use for bitcoin then that will be something that has some worth....even if just a tiny little Satoshi's amount of worth.
So...maybe don't give me such a hard time cuz I am pretty sure I never jumped up from behind you and started complaining that you weren't giving me enough free stuff.

I think it is a bubble. Sorry. When you print money, you are inflating. That is the last possible bubble.
Other things like assets, stocks, commodities, metals, etc...they will rise and fall based on the FED now instead of fundamentals. The bubble is the ever-growing money supply.
Anyhow, we somewhat disagree with each other. But that's OK. I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:13:14
I doubt it. I really hope so...but I just don't see much growth yet.
I feel that there just aren't enough people into bitcoin yet.

Yeah you can look up a water evaporative hybrid cooling system. Probably I made that up.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:30:36
You "fell for it?" Ummm...What did you "fall" for?
So, you don't think I have a small farm in the Southern Califirnia desert? OK.
And you are so certain that I am lying about it that you had to post about me?
Man...What is wrong with the world? Of course I am not lying. I posted some pictures that I had on my phone because many people thought I was making it all up.
But...Why would I make all this up? And the scam part? Who the fuck was I asking for money from?
Also, you posted that you wanted someone to bet me so that you would know who backs out first.well...YOU could be the guy who arranged the bet...Instead of asking someone else to do it.
Anyhow, I am going to post the pictures and videos of my farm. I already posted a few pics of what I had available but no one looked at them. They are still posted, by the way.
I don't even know what I say...Ummm...I guess people just don't trust me. I am guessing that either I am (1) so far beyond everyone here that most are stunned and jealous or (2) this is just a HUGE misunderstanding. I think it is the first one...Cuz how could ANYONE assume I was lying from a post that was a follow-up to a project I stated I was going to start here in this sub?
So...I am going to post pictures of my farm in the next few days. I am still hoping that someone will actually bet me that I am lying so that I can win some money. The best part about this is that I will prove I was not lying and no one will respond to those posts. Or if anyone responds it will just be more accusations that I photo-shopped the pictures or something similar.
For whatever it is worth: I get that people are spooked by me. But that is just your irrational fear.
If this post has fired up anyone else, maybe you will be the one who opens the bet and finally gets rid of me. Or at least proves it for those here who are afraid of me.

Also, sorry for lying about it being a greenhouse. I didn't know what to call it.

Because precious metals seem extremely overpriced to me. Do people TRULY believe that the world is going to be like the 'The Walking Dead' or something? No...We are gonna declare bankruptcy. Some rich people are gonna be poor and life will go on. Gold will go back to the equivalent of $400. Or maybe they will outlaw it along with bitcoin. They did it once before. They also blew up an atomic bomb once before. No...Twice.

How fascinated are you by me?
What does that feel like?
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:40:02
I can do all of this. Easily. But I am gonna get as much money as I can from the people like you  (except with money). Some people have made bets with me.
Some more will make bets with me. Cuz they just can't fucking stand me. Kinda like you. Then...when I am good and ready...those idiots will come out and we will prove it all.
You won't be there cuz you have no money.
You have made me so much potential profit so far. I hope you keep up the work on my behalf of firing people up to think I am a con man. People like you, but with bitcoin, are the best for someone like me.
If there actually is a Hell, I am in trouble. Unless God has a sense of humor. I read his biography...he seems like he won't get it.

Wanna bet? This one is super easy to win. I can prove this one as well. Make the bet on bitbet. But you won't. Cuz you can't.cuz you're poor and have no bitcoin. And you don't know what you are talking about.
The thing about science is that it is often quite easy to prove. What I wrote is already proven. And used. So I can link you to the papers and I can link you to labs using it. And we can make this bet right here. Right now. On this forum and any other forum you would like. Make it a science forum. I don't care. Because you will never do it cuz you have no idea what you are talking about. Hello do I know? Cuz you won't get me. You will just keep seeking my attention...which I bestow upon you. But only cuz you're funny. And stupid.
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:42:41
Yes. EVERYONE is IRRATIONALLY expecting a profit still. Just because the bubble has finally bubbled up to the actual surface (the FED and their money-printing) doesn't mean it has popped. They will keep printing til it pops. This is the final bubble.
We can all feel it. You disagree. That is exactly why we have a market. I buy bitcoin cuz I feel this way. If I turn on to be wrong about the bubble and it turns out all of fine...well...then it sounds good too...cuz EVERYTHING will be fine.
So, we will all kinda win.
@_date: 2017-01-03 07:34:53
Is there any chance that you just confessed to this? Either way....I think it would work.

It is basically an underground lake.

We have about 6kw available for mining in each medium sized greenhouse. And yeah...The capping is the problem.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:24:53
Thanks for the well wishes!
I don't use local bitcoins because I don't want to be killed. Also, no one is gonna bring me $150k to buy my coins. And I am not going there with that much cash. Then, where do I put it? How do I explain a $150k deposit in cash to my bank? They already don't trust me.
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:37:30
Yikes. Relax. And I take back my sympathy since you don't want it. I'll give it to someone who will appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:55:22
Cuz I am building this from scratch and it isn't even finished yet. Are you blind? No offense intended if you are blind, btw. The picture is of the greenhouse I am currently at right now. We are building it. An R4 is going in here next week as a test.
Our other miners are at the farm already. I am not there. I cannot take a picture. The pictures were not really for you anyhow. Stop being such a dick. Unless you really gotta be.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:46:26
Makes sense
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:11:09
We build them ourselves in China. They ate actually very efficient for the crop that this greenhouse is growing. Plus...the fish. We sell the fish as well. At a very high price.
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:34:26
We wouldn't do that. We like to take our time.
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:30:09
Yeah. the mining is just an efficient (I think...) way to monetize the power I already have to generate for my farm.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:29:48
Ballsy. All-in on zero fiat. Damn...
I wish you the the best!!
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:36:39
What ever happened to you? Are you in or near Borrego?
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:30:42
I have thought about this a lot. But it all comes down to how you can get free energy. My personal idea was to use the extra energy in my farm. You may come up with another one.
Some people I know have plugged into unknown sources of power and Internet connection.
You can do what I am doing. Start with a small home version of a vertical farm. You can build it yourself for a few hundred bucks. Then grow stuff and sell it. Hook it up to about 10 solar panels and about $1500 in a small battery bank. Then you can buy a small miner and I think it'll work. Now you have a system that will produce food and bitcoins. If bitcoins goes up, then you win. If it never goes up then you still have a device that makes lots of food.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:55:09
I store money in my bank. You have no idea what you are talking about. I do not use my bank's money. I use my money. So....If they sent a rep to my offices around the world to check up on me...Hmmm....I would sue them.
The bank cannot ask for anything they want because of KYC/AML. Where do people get this info? Ugh...People...They are the worst. But...Also they are the best because if they were not so fucking stupid then I wouldn't have what I have. So...thanks.
Anyhow...Yeah...sure...Banks can audit you without telling you and also without getting a warrant. And if you have an account at at a bank they are likely to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars sending reps all over the planet to review my business. Cuz these are things that a bank initiates on their own to comply with KYC/AML for all of their account holders. Yeah...
What is bitcoin gonna do tonight? I wanna make sure I do the opposite of what you believe.
@_date: 2017-01-25 02:06:44
Ok...I would take that bet.
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:05:58
That is something I would like to see...But I seriously doubt that would happen.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:38:32
You're right. I wanna delete my posts to you but I cannot allow myself to do that. So...if it means anything you, I thought I was responding to someone else.
That doesn't excuse what I wrote. I can't take it back. And I actually am sorry cuz when I read what you actually asked me...it wasn't that bad.
But still...I do feel that you could have been a tiny bit polite since you were asking for something. Also...I was unnecessarily rude...
And the Obamacare thing. Yeah. Sorry about that one too. That was SUPER unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:39:56
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:34:41
Maybe. The cool thing is that we'll see! I am betting my way will work out better...But maybe your way would have been better. I hedged my bet...I am gonna do both.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:52:13
What kind of link? And I don't have the miner installed in this unit yet. I am going to test an R4 in here next week since this  greenhouse is very small and can only support one miner.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:49:07
Yeah...The OP sounds like a straight-up crook. You're lucky your bank didn't get this guy as a customer. Which bank do you own, by the way?  I don't meet many people here who actually own a bank.

Sorry that I "had you" for so long. Send me your bitcoin address and MAYBE I I'll compensate you for your time.
You people are the worst. I am excited to post about my results from my bitcoin mining project. And what do I get? Fucking idiots like you. So let me get this straight? I am the guy who wasted your time by posting his results of his bitcoin mining project, right? And cuz I was unable to disclose the name of my supplier of panels and I tried to give you all the hints i was allowed to....You have now determined that I am a liar and have wasted your time?
Good. If you read all of that then I just wasted more. You're welcome for all the free info I provided you. Sorry that it wasn't enough to you. And sorry for being a horrible liar who is only out to waste your time.

I have been pretty vocal about bitcoin with my family and friends. Only two of my friends have ever bought. One guy bought 4. Another bought 2. I have recommended to nearly everyone I know to buy at least USD $25 worth of bitcoin.
Everyone I have ever recommended it to has made fun of me. Probably about...100 people. Except for the 2 guys who bought some, everyone still makes fun of me.
Of my wealthier friends (cuz I ain't got no wealthy family!), all of them still make fun of me and none of them own any.
Of my friends, ALL of them have, by now, asked me to GIFT them some. I won't do that. But they still refuse to buy it.
Adoption is gonna take an economic catastrophe, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:37:43

Listen, I will make this very easy for you. Just assume I am playing some kind of long con on everyone here. Assume that you realized it before everyone. If it super critical that you express this to everyone here then just create a separate post and warn everyone.
Or...Sit back and watch all of these poor people lose all their money to me.

You will spiral down a hole of obsession if you don't pull away from me. And I am not trying to be funny with this one.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:56:38
Sure. Seems reasonable. A random sub should require us to disclose our personal financial info. So that you are satisfied.
I wish that as well. For the record. But it won't happen. Also, I won't disclose info unless I have to or someone pays me to do it...Or I just feel like it.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:02:32
We are always looking for people to help us grow. We don't need investors or business partners. Or come check out what we do and see if you can copy it.

Take care.
@_date: 2017-01-22 05:20:59
Many people here dislike me. Some of the negativity is not related to the bitcoin mining...it is just that many people think I am an idiot because of other ideas I have posted here.
But some of the negativity is just my idea of mining. Personally, I don't get it. I mean...I get that many people don't like me. If I were not me...honestly....I wouldn't like me either. But what I really don't get is the negativity towards small mining operations. I am doing it. It works so far. If mining isn't worth it, then bitcoin isn't worth it.
Maybe I am not the most efficient of miners. Or...maybe I am.  But this is a good idea. Anyone negative towards it just doesn't get it. Also..the more people who are against it, the better. I like being the only one who gets it sometimes.

Umm...How does giving me your bitcoin address call you out? Yeah you just want a hand out. Duh.
Also, everything you go out of your way to post is meaningless. I am not lying. That is how I know it is meaningless. I get it. You are jealous. Just find a way to deal with it. Well...I mean...Obviously this your way of dealing with it. But there is a better way.
Or better yet, come out to my farm and let me know what you think.

I don't have that many. How much do you have? Let's get 80% of your stash. Right here. Right now.
You have insults. I have coin. I now know you are bitcoin broke. So I will allow you to insult me...Cuz you're broke and I am not...And that is fucking annoying.

@_date: 2017-01-22 03:21:13
Yeah. You're right. I was just answering as if it was the spot price and spot difficulty rate.
Either way here is what I think is likely true: no one can do better than me in terms of cost of electricity. Because mine was already sitting there not being used. Even if you use geothermal or some other cheap energy source, you still had to buy the equipment. I paid nothing for mine...I already had to buy it for my farm.

@_date: 2017-01-22 21:21:13
Ok. 1 bitcoin. Or half of a bitcoin. Or one Satoshi. Either way...can someone out there just actually bet me? If you are SO certain I am lying then this sounds like the perfect chance to win Internet points by getting rid of a guy that everyone here CLEARLY dislikes.
It's such a win-win. Unless I am telling the truth...then it is the opposite of a win-win.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:54:26
You're kind of like a better looking me!
Wow. Sounds like an awesome trip! I never back-packed anywhere in my whole life. I feel like it is a big gap in my life and I am too old for it now.
We're gonna hang out when you're back. Do you play basketball? And I only have lettuce to give you next week. Sorry. 
If you turn out to be awesome and we can find a role for you...and you need a job...then this will turn out to have been good for you. If not, you're awesome regardless and I am gonna try to be there in person if you really are serious about coming out. Play golf? Bring your clubs. We are setting up a greenhouse at Ram's Hill next week. Maybe you can see how one is installed if the dates work out. Then we can play the course that day! And you can post some pics of us. 
Unless it turns out we are the same person.
@_date: 2017-01-22 02:19:32
It was the only picture I had on this phone. We use a solar array for our farm. But these are the test greenhouses we build to test new environments and equipment.
Oddly this design is extremely efficient. We can easily change the angle to make it more efficency throughout the year but we found that it wasn't necessary. It produces more than enough.
We also sell these to other farms after we finish with them so this design is easy to ship out to someone. It costs us $40k to make one of these but we found out that several companies sell greenhouses like this for $60k but don't include solar, 5 days of batteries and a bitcoin miner. So we could actually turn these things into a business. But I don't want to.
We build the current greenhouses out of ICF. And we are about to start testing tilt-up. I'll post some pictures of these when I get a chance if anyone cares.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:54:22

@_date: 2017-01-22 21:02:56
These are some pics I posted in my original post. As long as you are not creepy, you can come out to our farm and if you see the greenhouse that produced these pictures, will that be enough to prove I did not photo-shop these pics? If I show you the land deed to the farm will that be enough? If one of those guys in the pics shakes your hand when you come out...will that be enough?
Also, anyone who comes out to visit us can have a nice free basket (box) of whatever produce we have available that day.
If people want to see some videos, I can try to post some. I think I have one or two on me now. I am not on my farm so I cannot take a live video today.
Also, is there seriously not one person who wants to bitcoin-bet me? Not even one person?  All these people who are certain I am lying and not even ONE of you wants to take my money? 
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:18:43
That's for sure. I already knew that. I don't need the internet to tell me that. I wish it could provide something useful.
Can it tell if I am cute?
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:19:10
Good thing I am not lying then.
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:28:59
You're putting words in my mouth. I never said I deserve it. You are weird.
I am not interested in making someone like you believe me. I am only interested in taking your money. If you will not offer it to me then you are only comedy for me.
I get it. You don't believe me. Then I will post my farm pics here and you still won't believe me. So...You won't believe me. But you sure are adamant that I am lying. You won't bet me that I am lying. Cuz....Well....That is too straightforward. It is much easier to just accuse.
Anyhow, I am going to post pictures here. But I am going to wait a little longer to see if anyone else wants to get in on the insults or accusations. Then I will ask them if they want to bet me. Then they will tell me that this clearly proves I am lying. Then I will post pics and no one will care. Cuz it turns out that basically no one cares about the info I posted on my mining project.
Also, this is the main sub for bitcoin. And no one cares about this information. That is probably more informative about bitcoin than some guy who MAY or MAY NOT HAVE lied to everyone about his small mining experiment.

@_date: 2017-01-10 01:00:45
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:09:20
So...If I post proof then what happens? Will you rush to my defense?
Also, I wanna make sure I understand...You are saying that my post about offering my experiences on a project that I detailed here several months ago is totally made up?
And not only is it made up, but I MUST prove to everyone that it is not a lie? But you already know it is a lie and you already told me it is a lie. So....What did you want me to do, again?
And then you tell me to "get the fuck out of here." Does that mean you want me to stop posting here? Can't you just ask the moderators to kick me out?
The best is when you state that the ONLY people who demand money be thrown on the table are scammers. First of all, where is this a known thing? I never heard of it. It seems like a good idea to me. You don't believe me? Wanna bet? Hmmmm....Seems like that is used often. SCAMMER? Umm.....Who am I "scamming"?
I am over it. I was never into it, actually. I am just often amazed at how stupid people can be. Anyhow, wanna bet me? I know this means I am lying but this is the perfect opportunity for you to take money from an evil criminal. Take my money. Seriously. Oh...And for the record: if you are telling the truth and no one believes you, you are actually likely to try to bet that person. If you know 100% that you are right. There...My theory is correct about what betting means. Your's was made up.
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:34:23
So...first off, I am not trying to do ANYTHING illegal. I am not trying to dodge taxes. I have a business that is in biotech. We are international and purchase from countries all over the world. This business account is linked to other accounts I have.
I also have a modern vertical farm. I purchase nearly everything from China and pay via wire transfer to dozens of foreign banks every month. These wire transfers are often held a day or two because of the regulations with large amounts of international wires.
I run a bitcoin mining operation in the Southern California desert. These bitcoins are often sold to a private buyer to avoid having the transaction occur on an exchange. I often wondered if this was the reason, but I reviewed the flagged wires and none of those were ever flagged.
OK...That is pretty much it. I am not hiding anything. I am just telling you that I exchange bitcoin for fiat (and back again) a lot. This caused two of my banks to threaten to close my accounts.
See...I did nothing wrong. How do I know? Cuz I know. I ALWAYS know when I am up to no good...
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:30:08
What else is there to know? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:27:21
This is a new one we are building. The old greenhouses are running the miners.
I just bought an R4 yesterday. I am going to set it up in this greenhouse next week when I receive it. This greenhouse is very small and can only run one miner. And a guy here convinced me to try the R4. I'll post my results on this in a few weeks when I have some good info.
The panels will be set up tomorrow most likely on this unit.

Good point. Thanks.

Well...You mined them yourself. So it is gonna be hard to track them down. You likely have very clean btc.
If $4million is a LOT of money to you then I have an odd suggestion: buy citizenship in Dominica for about $200k.
Then renounce your US citizenship. When you renounce your citizenship you will have to claim all assets. Forget your ownership of your btc and even your password or private keys.
Then pay your final bill to the US and stay or leave. But now you can go to a foreign country and convert your btc to fiat after you remember your key. Or keep it in your wallets and watch it grow even larger as the US tax system fails and taxes for people like you go to 50% or even higher.
That's my advice. Or you can just pay short term (I meant long term) capital gains (between about 20-24%) and you'll be OK also.
You don't need an accountant to guide your through your tax on this. It is just short term capital gains (long term, actually) Look it up. It's easy to file.
Edit- I meant LONG TERM capital gains...not short term.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:35:00
You should read my post history, actually. You will learn quite a bit.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:46:32
Not many. We only have a handful of greenhouses now. We have been testing designs and have only recently started building permanent structures. We expect to have about 40 farmhands by the end of the year.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:52:34
Thank you. That is what I am trying to say. Does no one else get that this will be super funny? Either I am lying and will be the figure-head for bullshit bitcoin scammers...or I will be the guy that EVERYONE wants to read when he posts.
How come no one here is wondering why so many people feel inclined to keep bashing me? Did anyone even read my posts? I detailed this basic plan over the course of several months. On here.
Then I post the results and everyone starts flipping out that I am some kind of thief that is looking to steal all of your money. How come no one talks about that?  Am I the only person that thinks this is SUPER weird?
Or...maybe I am just crazy. Oh...and good at Photo-shop.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:46:38
Already posted. Search for them if you'd like.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:53:09
Maybe I can help. What are some of the problems you have identified so far?
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:14:16
The panels are from a small company that was bought by Hanergy. They are very small and very efficient. But the most important is that they do not produce less power in high desert heat.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:59:37
Funnier. Keep going. Either way, it won't end in a bet. But maybe it will end with a chuckle.
I am sorry you are jealous. This might make it worse. Some people are rich cuz they randomly got into bitcoin early. Others are rich cuz they are just destined to be successful. Some people are just very smart. I am the combination of all three. You are the opposite of me. I am not jealous of you...Cuz..well...why would I be?
Now...Entertain me.
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:06:12
I'll take it. Make it public that you wanna make this bet on this sub. Lots of people will view this. It will drive the post to the top very quickly.
I want more of your bitcoin. The 10-to--1 was for the other guy. Unless you wanna publicly call me our and throw in a SERIOUS bashing of me before the start of the bet.
If you are truly willing to insult the fuck out of me and then publicly bet me...then I will give you 10-to-1 odds. If you just wanna call me a liar and fraud and then bet me...well..I think it should be 1-to-1.
Up to you. I am willing to bet you.
Anyhow...none of this will happen. But I am here if you wanna make the bet for real.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:47:39
Yeah.  It is true. We don't use glass anymore. We use a composite. But yeah. All of it is true.
I am not impressive. I just went through the numbers and decided to test it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:00:17
It is a modern type of greenhouse. It uses electric lights to maintain constant conditions.
@_date: 2017-01-22 03:50:41
Finally. A good question! 
We also have glass structures for certain crops. The reason we have airtight structures (yeah, they are air-tight) is because we grow organically with no pesticides. We go through two clean rooms before entering each greenhouse. We wear the same clean gear that they wear in the Intel commercials. We do not use any pesticide so we cannot have any infections. If we have an infection, we destroy everything in the greenhouse and re-boot.
Many crops require 70 degrees and high humidity. This is impossible in the desert unless you control the environment. This is too expensive with 125F and glass.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:20:16
Everyone who generates electricity should be mining with their excess. Of course this is based on bitcoin retaining its value while they are mining, but we're in this sub...so we already believe that.
@_date: 2017-01-22 10:50:20
It'll probably take about 14 months. But current estimates tell me about 275 days.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:59:52
I don't know how to send any more real of a picture than the ones I have already posted. Sorry that you can't see well. Before Obamacare disappears, maybe get glasses.
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:42:54
True. And not true. Literally.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:41:00
It wasn't. But now it is.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:04:07
It is possible I am a pathological liar. But I wouldn't bet on it.
Also, just because, what did I backpedal on? I don't feel that I backpedaled on anything...Unless I am forgetting something?
May I ask you a question, since you posted here? Is posting about bitcoin mining using solar not really the topic that people in this sub want to discuss? If so then maybe I just assumed this is where it should go. Is there a better place, in your opinion, for posts about bitcoin stuff?
@_date: 2017-01-22 11:11:17
I posted some. Look for them.
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:08:55
Ahhh...Yes. One of many things that keeps me up regarding this project.
I have many ideas though..
@_date: 2017-01-23 20:28:41
Oh...I have another request. This one is gonna sound a little crazy. And don't feel obligated to do it. But..in the northwest corner of my land there is sometimes an old homeless man who kinda lives in the pIle of junk in that corner.
He is very old. He is not dangerous in any way.
During the day he will not be there. If you're comfortable, can you look at this pile and let me know if there is any camping stuff or pots there? Again don't feel obligated. Just...no one has been there since the rains.
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:38:29
I think outlawed. After being regulated.
@_date: 2017-01-22 04:19:19

I feel that CNBC isn't very negative  about bitcoin. I feel that they try to avoid bringing it up but they don't seem to have any intention of bashing it. Yet.
They do make fun of Brian Kelly occasionally about his bitcoin though. Seems good natured in general though. I am wondering if he is the only person on that cast who owns it...
@_date: 2017-01-22 12:12:45
It turns out that we don't need that particular solution. Sorry that it bothers you. I wish it were better for you.

@_date: 2017-01-09 20:44:54
Ummm...they already ban bitcoin. I am not trying to ruin the day of the posters in that sub. I am trying to show them that the investment opportunity, while crazy and speculative, is not a pyramid scheme.
Or...I am being childish. I don't know. My motivations for this seem to be adult. But maybe trying to introduce something to a new group is something that only children do.
Your theoretical situation about the "shill coin" isn't valid. In any way.  But don't sweat it. I get it. You don't want me to do it. I am probably gonna do it anyhow (just without you). Sorry that you feel bitcoin is not an investment. I feel that it is. You can challenge me when I post in r/investing!
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:07:11
What do I expect? Seriously? You read my posts, right?
I am pretty sure I didn't expect what I got.
Alright. Send the signature. Then I will know you have nearly 10,000 bitcoin. Can you tell me how that will affect me?
I can tell you how my claims affected others. It made them mad. Your claim is irrelevant to me. But others may find it interesting. I suggest you post it.
I will provide pictures. I mentioned this.
@_date: 2017-01-25 06:04:47
Yes. This is actually what I am doing. It wasn't my initial intention. But I have noticed that no one ever seems to believe me. Now, most people will say it is because I lie all the time. I say it is because I am different than them. And they just can't get their minds around it.
So yes. It could be construed as a scam. But I feel that a scam is something you plan to do. This was something that I was surprised to see come my way. So I took the opportunity. There is nothing wrong in making bets. Just for the record. I mean..maybe in the olden times that would send you to Hell. But this is 2017. Gambling between two grown humans seems like something that shouldn't be judged by others.
I never forced anyone to bet me. And, in my opinion, they were gonna lose those bitcoin eventually. Making that bet was fucking stupid for them. At least I will do something productive with it. They would have sat on it til it hit zero.
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:37:52
Sure. Find that company and I will do it. Find a group of trustworthy people to act as escrow.
I have tried this before and it always ends up never working out. But I am always optimistic that it will work one day.
@_date: 2017-01-24 20:53:17
Thanks. I'll still post any pertinent info I feel like sharing as this project goes forward.

We're into it.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:21:45
That's the whole thing...what I am doing can be done by anyone. That is what I was trying to explain.
I don't know about the "toxic element". But I think that miners don't want us to know that things like this are possible.
Here is my current guess as to what is happening: no one on this sub really gives a fuck about my project and a handful of miners are scared that people may try to do what I am doing so they attacked me to discredit me. But they shouldn't be nervous. It turns out that no one gives a fuck...so they should relax.
However, I appreciate that they gave me an opportunity to fire up four idiots enough to bet me.
Reddit is awesome!

OK. Next. I am not gonna give you my contracts and open my business records to you. Ugh...As usual....Another person who just wants to bitch about the fact that they can't do what someone else is doing.
Sorry mate. I turns out that, in the real world, some people are better than you. Like...I am better than you. Find someone that you are better than and all this will work out for you.
Or....Stop making excuses and bet me.

My buddy is a shit. He is awesome to hang out with but he is a straight-up scoundrel. He told me that everyone at Wells is up to something. He says his department is like every other department there. He also said they are all afraid at his level and above about what may be coming.
Maybe he is exaggerating. I don't know. But that scam they were running at their bank was fucking stupid and petty. If that low level shit is happening, just imagine what is going on up above.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:58:23

Italy's banking crisis is likely to get going in 2017. However, like the this long-and-drawn-out economic collapse that is currently unfolding, it could happen later. Either way it'll hurt the Euro (which will actually help the European economy briefly). I watch these banks and many other financial products that are related to these banks. I can tell you that the banks will be bailed out and it'll hurt the Euro. And I feel it'll happen in 2017 (but it could be delayed with "massive infrastructure spending"). Yeah..bitcoin will go up. In January? That one I don't know. Maybe. Will it be up by the end of 2017? Yeah. Almost certainly. Will it be because of the Italian banking crisis? Sort of....plus all the other financial engineering projects that are currently unwinding.
The ETF...it won't get approved. Why would our government allow this to get approved? I mean...seriously. Bitcoin is mostly used for buying drugs, illegally transferring money, or doing illegal shit. So...no...it won't be approved. I am not trying to be a dick or trying to be funny. I am just telling you that this is the CURRENT main use of bitcoin (other than holding or trading as an investment...but is that really a "use"?).
If the ETF were to be approved then bitcoin would go up a LOT. I am a mediocre mathematician (by trade). My estimate is that bitcoin will quickly go to about $4,000 if the ETF is approved. And yes, it will become a gold rival. But I have no idea how much this will affect the overall gold market since that market is HIGHLY manipulated and is now mostly based on complex derivatives.
The "underlying asset" (aka BITCOIN) cannot be traded with a "high frequency." That is true. But that just affects its volatility usually. It can still be traded in large quantities, so large orders can go through. And those large orders can go through more quickly if they decide to pay a fee to expedite it. So...I wouldn't worry about any of that. Plus, the exchange spot price is very accurate and the ETF will just mirror this. Basically, if the SEC is not controlled by whomever it is that is keeping a regulatory hand on bitcoin, then it'll be approved. But...it won't be approved, don't worry.
For the record: I want it to be approved. Also, it would be a feedback loop for a while. It would be SO crazy the first few days after it opened. Just....imagine....

@_date: 2017-08-23 03:09:02
I offer bitcoin to EVERYONE I work with as an option for payment to or from. If I pay someone in bitcoin, I usually purchase a replacement amount if it was a large payment.
I offered my house on VRBO with a 10% bitcoin payment discount but only one guy ever contacted me about It but he never rented the house. I sold that house but I had it on VRBO from 2012 til I sold it in 2015. The bitcoin offer was in there from almost the beginning.
When I pay for stuff with bitcoin, it is usually Chinese suppliers for my business and most of them don't accept bitcoin. My employees will sometimes accept maybe a 5% bitcoin salary, but only because I am often suggesting they do it and some of them have started following the price.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:33:10
I agree with you. It is just such an infringement on what I feel is my money. I guess...It isn't REALLY my money.

Yeah...there you go! Tell me about your 3D printing business. I am ALWAYS looking for new businesses to invest in. And I have been looking into this as a business.
My friend is CRAZY into this. And drones. So he is sorta weird. Sorry if you are also into drones. I think I still have an old one somewhere...
Anyhow, he keeps sending me info about the business. You're in it. Is it worth it? Is it an energy hog? Isn't the primary cost the raw material?
Yeah. Get solar. Buy from an Alibaba supplier. It is kinda easy. About $.50 per watt for a small order of panels. About $2k for the control system. About $10k to $30k for off grid battery bank for most homes. Or just sell it back to your power company if they will let you and don't waste money on batteries.
Solar is super cheap. Do it yourself. It is also easy. Don't waste your money with the rebates and certified installers.

Ok. Well...that is my contribution..I said I would invest 100 bitcoins now. My original post was asking for more people to invest. I feel that this could possibly gain momentum and more people may click, read what I wrote, and decide to join. Or they will hate me and stop clicking.

I wasn't lying about the bitcoins. If enough people are interested then I will put them into the fund. I never said I would give them away. You said that. Not me. I feel it is not fair to make things up. I said I will put them up.
I have some advice for you: just stop. I get it. You don't like me. Why can't it just be that?

@_date: 2015-07-21 16:36:13
No. I am just the guy who proposed an idea and asked the community if they were interested. Also, you forgot to mention that I am the guy who is willing to work on the details. Oh...and also the guy who offered 200 bitcoin as the initial investment.
You forgot about those 2 important things. Unless you were just trying to make fun of me...then disregard the details. Focus on the insult. It is funnier that way, I guess.

Also, "ever" is a long time. I agree.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:39:58
1) I never said that it will even work. I was just saying that I had this idea. I felt strongly enough about it that I would give 100 bitcoins to the project. Then people like you just started trashing me and my idea. And the stuff they wrote was stupid. But funny. Like what you just wrote...You are seriously trying to tell me that the app I want to build can be hacked because the two cheating spouses will have to meet up in real life....thus removing anonymity. Was this even worth writing? I mean...wtf? Of course they have to meet up if they wanna fuck each other? But that does not give them the ability to hack the bitcoin payment system. Ugh....why would you even write something so stupid? Of course there can be no real anonymity when they meet. Do we really need you to point that out to us? What I meant was that the app will hold no user ID and the payment system will be bitcoin. The people themselves will still have to be careful....but no hacker can come out and release their names and emails to the world. Ugh...seriously...you're stupid. No fucking duh....of course the two people will eventually meet. You're like...Einstein-level (when it comes to banging your cousin...but not when it comes to intelligence).
2) I never shouted. And I feel that it has to happen "now" because Ashley Madison just got hacked "now". In my opinion, this is the best time to try to launch quickly. The market for cheating spouses isn't going away...but the trust in Ashley Madison is. I say that we disrupt Ashley Madison. They are charging too much anyway. Let's make our app bitcoin only and the max amount anyone will ever pay is 20% of what Ashley Madison charges on a monthly basis. And, more importantly, let's institute micro-payments. Maybe 10 messages for the equivalent of a penny. Idk...disrupt. Either way...let's get people to switch to bitcoin. That is my ultimate goal.
3) Ok. You are not impressed with my idea. So...? What's your point? That you can out-idea me any day? Ok. Cool.
4) Ummm....no. I am not gonna do your stupid homework assignment so that I can get an hour of your time. First off: you think my idea is stupid...why would you waste an entire HOUR of your time? That is even more stupid than my stupid bitcoin/Ashley Madison idea. I don't want you in our group. You're kind of a dick.
---Awaiting your response where you basically just call me an asshole. Just remember: you posted to me first...not the other way around. So when you do your best to insult me again...try harder.

That's a good place to stop reading.
Also, countries can definitely NOT allow something. IDK if people are just into arguing or what. But there is this  thing that humans created a LONG time ago. It is called a LAW. They make these LAWS so that things/acts become punishable. They define what the act is. Then...if someone does this THING/ACT and they are caught, then they get in trouble.
I like that you stopped reading my post and then commented on it.
Also, signals can be stopped. Just for the record. I don't know if you have ever heard of blocking a signal....I am guessing you never heard of that because you started reading your Physics textbook and then just....stopped.
Lastly, I never wrote what you are claiming I wrote. I NEVER said they could STOP it. You just decided to claim that I said it.
I feel that you are not really good at reading.

@_date: 2015-07-07 05:42:38
I think I get what you're saying. I have to think about it some more. I, initially, don't feel that I agree. But I am wrong about stuff.
Can't we just make garbage collection private as well? And utilities could be private as well. Solar is gonna be cheap in 10 or 15 years. I feel that most people can just buy it. And those in lousy sun areas can pay higher rates...cuz they chose to live there.
Also...isn't a Satoshi like 100 millionths of a bitcoin? Seems REALLY cheap for a streetlight to be on all night.
Buying weapons...hmmmm...let's make those illegal. That way no one can use them, including the government. Of course we will need the government to go after people who break laws. So...they may need weapons.
Either way, I don't see any real government allowing bitcoin to compete with them. It is just too easy to keep your money out of their hands with bitcoin. And they will never allow that (in my opinion).
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:08:30
This is a bitcoin-only app. I feel that many people are not getting the opportunity here. If this stays in the news then people will hear about what we are looking to create. We can download the hack and get everyone's email. We can email them and tell them about our app. We can explain how to acquire bitcoin so that they can start trying to fuck each other by connecting through our platform/app.
The key here is getting more people to acquire bitcoins. If a lot of people need anonymity to cheat then this seems like a good chunk of consumers who have no current option for meeting those people. No one is gonna trust Ashley Madison right now. We gotta offer them a safer alternative RIGHT NOW. If not then the opportunity is lost.
The key is also incorporating micro-payments. Make it WAY cheaper to connect through our platform. Maybe something like 10 messages per $.01. Micro-payments! Ashley Madison could NEVER do that. People will be interested because we will not charge monthly fees. Just transaction micro-payments for each message. And the cost per message will be CHEAP.

Thanks. I am looking at your history now. Appreciate the offer.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:53:44
I'm on my phone. At work.
Your job doesn't start til 2 weeks before Xmas. You have the time to be in front of your computer. I don't.
Don't be so ornery. You insulted me for no reason. I read your unprovoked insult and decided to have some fun with you. I clearly upset you...I am good at that. Now you're having a hard time dealing with it.
I gave you the solution last time: stop responding to me. I am better than you. At everything.
....I am awaiting your lame response/insult.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:13:49
I will converse with you. So...if this reddit shuts down then bitcoin is gone? Ok...I see what you're saying. You're saying that this sub is the center of the universe for bitcoin. I get it.
I don't agree with you at all. But I felt bad that you got downvoted (so I upvoted you). Plus you wanted to converse.
It seems like you're right about the Greeks not wanting to use bitcoin. They probably wanna stay in the Euro. And your last comment about the most important part of your conversation (the sub closing down and making bitcoin essentially disappear)....well...maybe they are not conversing about it because they are afraid that it is true. Maybe the people who own bitcoin and the investors and companies in the space are also afraid of this subreddit closing down....so everyone here just keeps their mouths shut because...you know...if the moderators here got mad then they  may just decide to end bitcoin forever...by closing this forum.
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:11:58
Ok, CTO. You beat me. I wanted to bet you. You said you didn't wanna bet. You win. You are better and smarter than me.
What can I do? You won't bet me so I can't prove it. You went through my posting history, which is creepy. You have clearly found evidence of where I have failed at businesses, according to your investigative work into my post history.
Sounds like betting me would be a slam dunk for you. But...I get it...you're teaching me in a "different" way. Damn...Mr. CTO....you are one clever angel. Thank you so much for everything you have done for me.
I am going to change. I am going to be better. You not betting me...and taking all my money...that was saintly. Thank you again.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:57:35
Idk...I just bought a bunch a long time ago (in bitcoin time). I guess...I was just lucky.
My reading comprehension is atrocious? Bummer. I'll try harder.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:38:49
Can't someone here just download the database from the hack and tell us the answer? In other words: how many women had accounts vs men.
@_date: 2015-07-25 05:52:25
None of us can make it fly if we can't get it built. It looks like the database may be released. But none of us can make this thing fly without that database. A working app....and the database in our possession....those are the only 2 things that will make this thing work, imo.
I have several people interested so far. Maybe we can all chat a little this weekend to see what we all think?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:15:49
Also, maybe paying $27k for such a site is too much..Idk. We need it up and running super fast. This is a limited time type thing. Only while it is big news. We gotta take advantage right now.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:34:15
Idk. Find someone to place it in escrow. Have my attorney set it up. Find an online service. Trust some guy here that lots of you trust. Something like that. Or someone may have a better idea. I just wanna try it. I feel that I am totally comfortable committing 100 to 200 bitcoins to this project. It has such a low probability of being successful. But this is the best time to try it, in my opinion. Seriously....just wait til these men and women have to deal with this. It is going to fucking suck. At least some will escape without anyone knowing and still want to get laid without their wife or husband knowing. If we can provide them with a simple way to acquire bitcoin and then give those bitcoins to us for creating a site for them to all fuck each other....then at least some of us who have bitcoins that they want to invest should do this. And do it now while this is happening right now....and people are flipping out right now...and lots of people have at least heard of bitcoin.
Anyhow, yeah...not much of that has to do with escrow. But I am pretty sure we could find a consensus on an escrow solution. How about this, if we can't come up with a better idea: I will pay up to 100 bitcoins for the firm to set up the escrow service for us if we reach some final investment amount (that we just came to through a consensus). But the group should pay me back those bitcoins if we were to ever achieve an unlikely profit.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:24:07
Yes. It is too much to ask. Is that even a real question?
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:57:47
Hmmm....Idk. It is funny that you talked about how women always cost money anyhow. But I feel that paying women to come onto the site is different from what I wanna accomplish. I want a bitcoin-only, fully anonymous version of Ashley Madison. A version that cannot have your real personal info hacked and then held for ransom.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:04:45
How do "we" do that? Are you working on it? I wouldn't even really know what to do.
Is posting about it here on Reddit the "movement" you are talking about?
Either way: my original post about my opinion on why Bitcoin will not be allowed in Greece (as a currency) was posted here to see if anyone else agreed. No one really agrees with me. I am not surprised. This is a forum for bitcoin lovers. I am guessing most people here are millionaires/billionaires from bitcoin so...it's gonna be hard to find someone here who agrees with me.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:12:27
Ummm...it's also smart people who can see the inadequacies of the existing systems. According to your logic, only losers and unsuccessful people fixed broken systems.
You seem smart. Can I ask where you heard the thing that you just posted? Or...did you have one of those moments of brilliance and come up with that all on your own?
Man...that was REALLY stupid...I mean...REALLY stupid. Sorry....i just wanna say it one more time...you truly believe that if someone finds an error in a system then THEY are losers and unsuccessful? Ok. That it the funniest dumb thing of the day (so far).
I am learning a LOT about this subreddit. Is anyone here not an idiot? Anyone? Or...even better...is anyone here in agreement with this guy? That would actually be even funnier!
Please do not EVER delete this post. Please.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:20:43
Well...as long as you can jerk off in a circle with your friends over my idea being shit upon...then all will be well with you.
So...you're welcome, I guess.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:36:19
Good summary. That pretty much sums it up...without even talking about the transactions being handled on the network.
I think I basically just said what you did..but I am still gonna post.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:56:13
Ok. I guess. Also...We don't have a site yet. It is just an idea of mine which is 4 hours old. And....giving me money so my site can get hacked....hmmmm...that seems not even worth writing. Come up with something more clever. At least try. I wanna see how smart you are, ok?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:02:04
Ok, lemme check it out. Where do I check that out?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:40:29
Idk. Maybe. You could put it out there if you want now on the blockchain. Are your escapades that worthy?
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:18:04
Oh...I know what all those internet-thingy-words mean. Don't worry. I just felt that it was time to stop using them. Circle jerk is played out. Plus it's fucking weird to think about.
Either way, thanks for trying to help an old man out. Where can I sign up for internet classes?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:36:38
Also a good point. But how are you gonna prove that? If we focus on explaining how to easily acquire bitcoin, and we use the hacked database of users....then shouldn't we primarily have the same distribution as Ashley Madison?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:00:35
Go ahead. If she really wanted it then what can I really do? Also, I am not married. But I probably will eventually be. It would be ironic if both of you were to meet in the future on the site we are talking about building right now.
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:12:17
Is your reddit name u/coolsanta because you work as a Santa Claus a couple weeks per year? And you're "cool" cuz the kids really seem to think that you're Santa? At least you have pride in your job. A lot of people would be embarrassed by that. I appreciate your pride.
Do you have any other part-time/seasonal jobs? Or is it just a couple weeks a year cuz you're old and fat with a beard?
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:47:32
Hmmmm...no. I am not embarrassed. But I give you my FULL permission to internet-embarrass me.
Also, I may have no idea what I am talking about..you may be right. What else do you got?
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:02:43
Yeah...don't trust me. Trust bitcoin. Duh.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:29:15
Well.....they are technically not whores. But you got cheated on so I can understand your anger. My suggestion: find some chick that will sleep with you and do your best to get over it.
Your idea is gonna be tough to get off the ground. Bitcoin divorces....sounds lame. But if you believe in it then you should go for it!
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:07:20
Hmmm....according to your logic: everyone who lies once will only lie going forward. Don't invest with us. That is my best advice for you regarding this post.
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:22:05
I have no idea what you mean. I am not trying to be rude. But...I have no idea how those 2 statements are mutually exclusive. I feel that I am REALLY good at logic. And I am not getting it.
Also, I never said the Greek gov't cannot force their citizens to pay taxes. So...that sort of seems like a thing that you just wrote. Please don't attribute it to me.
Is there any chance that you are trying to say that if they cannot enforce one law then they must (by your logic) be unable to enforce ALL laws? It feels as if that is what you mean. If so, then you need to add another statement above the first 2. It should be a universal rule that Greece has no power to enforce anything. Of course....then you wouldn't need to write the other 2 because they would both fall under the 1st rule. Simpler logic!
If that is what you meant then...IDK what to say. You just didn't understand me, basically. Also, you implied I wrote something that I didn't.
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:38:47
I guess....but I am pretty sure that Greece is not comprised of 100% foreign restaurants. But....I have never been. Maybe everyone there owns a foreign restaurant.
Of course, now that I think about it, if everyone there owns a restaurant....how do they hire people? How do they buy things that are farmed? How does the mail get delivered? Who fixes the cars?
No. I do not mean "like foreign restaurants that do cash only." I mean that the government won't allow bitcoin (if it became quickly large there) because they would lose financial control.
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:32:30
I don't know. I guess I am wrong. Sorry about getting it wrong. I guess...maybe I should buy a lot more bitcoin now cuz maybe Greece is gonna adopt it in the next few days?
How do you think it'll happen? Will the government have the instructions ready for everyone by Monday on how to set up their bitcoin wallets?
Since bitcoin is about to become the currency of Greece....how many days do you think before it spreads all over Europe? Bitcoin is digital...hmmm....maybe a few weeks?
Anyhow, all joking aside, they can force them by making it illegal. Well...that is the best they can do, at least. Kinda like how people can smoke crack here in the U.S. but it is illegal to do so. I guess you could ask me the same question about how the U.S. could force people to not smoke crack. I suppose they could make it illegal...
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:35:33
That is what Reddit is for. Advertising? Paying for it? No. If this app were to actually get built soon and work....then I see no reason to waste money on that shit. If it is legit then people will hear about it and it will grow just fine.
I can get this site on CNBC in a news story. If it got big enough it would make it to several subs here. If the app is lame and impossible for new users to figure out how to get bitcoins then all the ad revenue in the world won't help anyhow.
We need to make the bitcoin version of Ashley-Madison. That's it. If it works and is easy to use then people will show up. But we have to piggy-back off the news that will be out there. Famous people will be discovered. It should grow as a news story for some time. We have this much time to capitalize. That's it.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:17:25
True...but that was not the point of my post.
Is anyone here even kinda smart? Anyone??
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:51:50
Ok. So, you're better at everything than me. So...? What does that award you? Wanna have a public bitcoin-off? The winner will have to give up 100% of all their bitcoins in their wallet publicly. The wallet must have existed for at least 3 days before today. And, since we are talking about millions of dollars, we will have to pay a firm to regulate this. I will offer to pay the firm that will regulate this challenge (unless your bitcoin wallet is worth even less than the amount it will cost me to pay this company). Wanna do it? I am in, if you are. You must confirm that you are the owner of this user name and the owner of your wallet. The 3rd party service that we both agree upon will be paid for by me (if you can prove you are liquid enough to cover those costs). And the entire wallet must be transferred to the winner. The winner is the one with the largest bitcoin wallet.
Let me know when you're ready, OK? Otherwise just go back into the shadows and sulk.
Also...since I am in a gambling mood...let's compare resumes...but with a twist. You must prove your income over the past 15 years in businesses that you worked for or owned. If you made more money than me...then I will also give you....idk....$100,000 cash. I was gonna say $1 million....but that would be embarrassing and demeaning if I lost that bet. If I just went up against a real bitcoin "whale" then I will just consider it a lost wallet wallet for me and I can talk about how I went all in on a crazy bet. Don't worry though...I have other wallets. I'll be ok.
What do you say? I am in. Are you? Or....are you just gonna lob more insults over your computer and hide?
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:03:16
Ok. The "movement" to get bitcoin in Greece is raising the block size. I get what you wrote. No idea how that even applies to anything I was writing about...but...yeah.
I just, personally, don't feel that raising the blocksize is something I can work on. I mean, technically, I could work on it I suppose. But I actually don't feel that it is the thing that will get the Greek government to allow bitcoin to be a legal currency there.
Does ANYONE here even understand what I am writing about? Basically, I feel that Greece will NEVER allow it as a currency. They even said it recently. But when I write my opinion as to why...people just write that I basically have no idea what I am talking about...and it is pretty much gonna happen.
If it is gonna happen then why isn't each bitcoin worth $10k? Probably cuz it ain't gonna happen. I still own and trade bitcoin (everyday) but I don't feel that Greece is gonna adopt bitcoin as a currency. If I am wrong then EVERYONE here can clown on me...as I make nearly a billion off my bitcoins...in which case...laugh away.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:16:24
Kinda funny! That was better than your behind-your-computer-insult to me.
At least you genuinely made me laugh. Now, just be polite and don't write to me again.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:41:15
I have "no sense of the market." Ok. That is a worthwhile post. Umm...how do you know that, by the way? I mean...I posted a question about interest-level in an idea I just had a few minutes before posting it.....so...how did you come to that conculsion? I know you won't really respond but...if you feel like it, could you actually tell me how you pieced it all together? I assume you have the "market sense", otherwise you would never be able to so easily tell I am missing it.
Also, just for the record, what is wrong with my initial idea of mass marketing to all the existing Ashley Madison customers? Do you have a better idea? What is your better idea, based on your "market sense"?
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:26:26
Well....someone is eventually gonna have to explain micro-payments to people. We might as well find applications that sync well with micro's.
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:14:10
That was funny.
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:18:04
Alright....what else you got?
@_date: 2015-07-24 04:20:47
Never heard of him. And, just for the record : probably bunches of people sorta had a similar idea. The key for me, however, is that Ashley Madison must NOT pay the ransom. We need that database. The hackers MUST release it. That is how we spam those who got hacked. If Ashley Madison pays the ransom then we are kinda stuck.
Let's hope....!
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:06:58
Finally. I honestly feel that I am really funny. How come no one ever LOL's with what I write??
@_date: 2015-07-05 04:01:38
70? That is very low. It seems like you are in a heated mood today. I feel that you should just relax, watch the fireworks, hang out with your internet buddies. Then go to bed. Wake up tomorrow and worry about your own problems.
People with low IQ's tend to feel inferior and often attack others for also being less intelligent. Even if you are not very smart, you could try to be polite.
My IQ is above 70. But not that much. I am OK with it. You should just get over it. You were born that way. Use it as a reason to achieve.
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:58:12
Hilarious. Every once in a while there is someone funny here. Thanks for making me laugh. "Hobo nickel"....damn that is funny. And they collected it.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:20:33
I  am not trying to be rude. But I already know all that stuff. All this happened yesterday morning  so I posted soon after hearing about it to see if anyone else may be interested in going after Ashley Madison customers with a bitcoin solution.
What I got as responses were mostly insults and people telling me I have no idea how to run a business. Ummm....it just fucking happened an hour or so before I posted. How the hell am I supposed to have all that stuff done in an hour?
Steve Jobs? Seriously? You wanna tell me I need to be more like Steve Jobs?  How about I just be me? The guy who posted his idea a few minutes after he had it, on Reddit? Does everyone who posts here have to have everything all worked out before he asks a question? Can I just post here and see if ANYONE else is interested in talking about something? Why do I have to keep getting people telling me what I haven't done yet? I know I haven't done much...cuz it just fucking happened.
Steve Jobs. Ok. Thanks for telling me that I need to be more like him before I post an idea here.
Here is an easier way to deal with posts like mine: laugh to yourself at my utter idiocy...and just leave it at that. Don't tell me that I need to have invented a time machine, go back in time, do all the work, then when the event happens I will be more prepared to talk to everyone on Reddit about my idea.
I know you're gonna think I am being a jerk. But...my intention is not that. My intention is to see if ANYONE even wanted to duscuss how we could take advantage of this situation to increase the number of users of bitcoin. What I got was insults, business lessons, more insults,  and accusations of being a liar.
Overall, it was a worthless experiment on this subreddit. But...very comical. At least I got some laughs. For whatever that is worth.
Anyhow, thanks for the follow up post. But...I am not gonna go back in time and do all the stuff you recommended. I am gonna just talk to the people who PM'd me and see if we can get something started.
Lastly, personally, I didn't really think Steve Jobs was all that great. No offense to him. He would also think I am not great. He is not the type of person I feel like emulating. I am old. I actually kinda like how I do things...even when it doesn't always work out.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:42:01
What it CLEARLY means is that I never said what you are implying I said. I never said it. I never implied it. I never meant it. You wrote it and then said I wrote it. Just...look it up if you don't believe me. If you can find where I wrote it then I will apologize and try to find out how to finally use the tip-thingy and send you...IDK...$5. Is that fair?
I simply said that many people don't pay their legal taxes. They pay part of them. Not ALL people. Why...you ask? Because it is ILLEGAL and not all Greeks are breaking the law....cuz some are afraid of the punishments of the law.
Please do not attribute statements to me (or anyone for that matter) that they did not say or write.
You misunderstood me. Let's just leave it at that. You seem like you are impassioned about bitcoin. I kinda need that if I am gonna make money off of bitcoin. So....just be impassioned and keep buying.
@_date: 2015-07-04 07:34:34
Exactly. Finally. One person who kinda agrees with me. Also, yeah..it would buckle. Block-size debate: over.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:56:59
Meh. No.
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:21:28
I am the Original Poster. I feel that being honest is better than the suggestion you gave me. Idk though...maybe your way of doing things is better. Are you into experiments? Let's make a small experiment. I will show you all my business ideas and the original business plans. Then, you show me your business plans. Then....we will see how much you made off of your's and I will do the same. My theme throughout the years has always been consistent. I focus on reasonable expectations. I prefer to be brutally honest. I don't glitz and glam anything. I barrel my way through it if I believe in it.
I believe in this idea. It sounds like you don't. My suggestion is just to avoid posting to me since you feel I have no idea what I am doing and you also feel that I am too uncertain.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:21:34
Fair enough. If there does happen to be a hell then I give you permission to laugh down on me from heaven. See...it all works out in the end. So you don't even have to waste time insulting me now in the imaginary/before-heaven-happens world.
Also, just for the record, you could try to get me to come over to the bright side of the force instead of starting off right away with an insult.
Lastly, I have never considered myself shortsighted. Maybe I am but I don't feel it. So therefore I am not shortsighted. Evil??? Idk...I don't feel evil. I feel average. Do you feel greater than average?
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:06:48
OK. I haven't seen RoboCop. When I get a chance I will review the future (via the movie) and plan accordingly.
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:38:09
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:40:41
I actually have no idea what you are talking about. I am only responding to you because you're accidentally funny and I hope that each subsequent response will become more funny.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:35:13
I think he found part of Satoshi's private key that was likely stored in Satoshi's trailer when he died. He found enough private investors to purchase a super-computer and is working on the rest of the key.
Well...that's my theory.
Either way, he is rotten. If, for some reason, he is Satoshi then I hope we fork away from anything related to these hundreds of patents.
Satoshi never sold a single bitcoin. Why the fuck would he start a company and start filing patent applications?
Either way: exciting, isn't it!!!
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:59:28
So....no? You're not gonna take my millions when I offer them? I would have taken your's. For the record.
I am glad to hear that you feel that your years as a CTO can immediately tell you if an idea is bad. You're so lucky. How am I able to keep succeeding? Must be just straight up luck. It has to end soon, I guess. I mean...probability and all that, right?
Also...what are imaginary insults? Are they insults that I just imagined I wrote...but I never wrote them? Just curious about that one.
Lastly, thanks for your concern about my "manic episode" I seem to be having. I can tell you are really concerned. The concern is leaking through all those insults. I know it must just be your CTO-level "tough love."
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:52:33
So? I think most people who downvoted me are idiots. There..it all works out! You think I am a piece of shit..which, by the way, is weird...because have you ever tried to have a conversation with a piece of shit? Have you ever gone out of your way to insult a piece of shit?
See what I mean? You're an idiot too. You go out of your way to insult a piece of shit. All you had to do was just laugh behind your computer at me in all of your unbound glory. But instead you chose to toss out an insult to me when I never did that to you.
I don't expect you to understand what I am writing. Oh...and downvotes? Hahahaha!!! wow...downvotes. Imaginary dislikes. That is hilarious. Do you care about downvotes? I just upvoted you so you don't have to worry!
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:18:17
I feel that maybe you misunderstood me. I want to build the app. For sure. But the immediate opportunity is in spamming the database. At least...to me that is the best once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this segment of potential bitcoin users. Like I wrote in my posts: I feel that everyone is always bitching about not having an app that REALLY takes advantage of bitcoin. Well....this one would. Micropayments and semi-anonymity. For this type of thing, bitcoin seems perfect. Ashley Madison already did all the work of building and marketing what they are. Let's just spam everyone that paid them and tell them that we are sorry...some of us also got caught....and this is the best solution for them. Maybe some will join. Maybe some will buy a few dollars worth of bitcoin. Maybe it will grow. But...either way...this is the type of app that works well with bitcoin. Using the Ashley Madison hack is the best way to tap into 37 million people who should be using our app anonymously....and paying WAY less to fuck outside their marriage. In my opinion.
@_date: 2015-07-20 17:05:01
So I will just wait til someone does it for me. If they don't then I will do it myself if I really wanted to know.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:38:40
What am I clueless about? Did someone ask me a question and I was unable to answer it? Did I write a bunch of stuff that has already been proven to be wrong?
Are you just saying I am a clueless dick because I wrote a post about an idea I had this morning and you read a few people insulting me and my idea...so you decided to jump in too?
How about this: don't respond if you don't have anything to say. Or respond with an insult that I don't deserve (cuz I never insulted you before) but that insult HAS to be fucking funny. Otherwise...if you send me an unprovoked insult then....wtf..? Of course I can respond if I want to. And I now have the right to insult you.
What about this do people not understand?
Also....wtf is up with this subreddit? I get it...no one thought my idea was good. That is fine. But insulting me...and doing it so poorly. Ugh....I was really hoping that there would be some intelligent people here. At least some people who were smart and funny with insults. But what I get is...this. What a total let-down.
So far: this subreddit sucks. My idea may have been lame...but your insults as a community were even worse than my idea. Can one person lay into me with something good at least? Just..one person?
And...let me get this straight? You think I am "trolling" for investors? Wtf does that even mean? Do you think I am out here trying to get people to invest in my company? Where did you come up with that? I said that it should be a consensus project. Each person has their agreed upon ownership via investment into an escrow account or they work and are paid in equity. Or...they work and are paid in bitcoins from the investment fund that we set up. What kind of "troll" does that? What kind of "troll" offers 100 bitcoins as a starter? Do you even read stuff before posting?

Agreed. Remember when it was immoral to drink a glass of wine? Remember when it was immoral for 2 people from different races to marry? Anyhow....yeah. I still kinda agree that my idea is immoral. But I also feel that, in the future, it won't be as immoral. The people who commit it are immoral (in the future). For now: we are all immoral.

I do plan to attempt to move forward. But I must confess that the hacked database is the key. I tried, in my original posts, to explain the ethical issue and its importance to my overall idea. And that is....that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to swoop in and attempt to replace something with its bitcoin counterpart. I fully understand that it is shady. And it sucks. But it'll be free marketint and it's the only real/verified database that has ALL the people in the US and Canada who actually went outta there way and joined Ashley Madison. If you wanna create an Ashley Madison knock-off then....good luck. It has been attempted before. If you wanna make it bitcoin-only....go ahead (it will probably fail). If you wanna make it bitcoin-only AND go straight for their customers for free then we can talk about moving forward. If you are ethically opposed then I understand. I don't like it either. But the hack was the ONLY reason I asked this community. You see: the hack is the key. If you feel that competing head-to-head with Ashley Madison is worth your time then feel free. If you wanna take the shortcut then I am interested.
No hard feelings at all if you are not interested. I had 20 or so people PM me. About a third just want me to pay them in bitcoin to build this app. About a third don't wanna use the hacked database. And the last third seem like they believe in my idea. Two people seem to love it. And you can see from the responses in the subreddit that about 98% of those people think I am an idiotic dick.
@_date: 2017-04-13 22:55:15
We'll see. If you take it as bullish then I assume you are buying. So...for you it is bullish. For me, it is the opposite. I guess the best way to measure it is over the entire marketplace. I'll just see how it plays out.

You got me. My bad. Sorry.
You got me good.
I never thought about changing my embarrassing comment to later read as if I didn't just embarrass myself. Damn...you ARE freaking clever!!!
Also, just for the record, I wrote it. Maybe you can re-edit your post again to READ that instead. Then it will be even WAY more embarrassing for me.
My bad. Sorry.

Probably. But I feel that this is a bigger story than most people would think.
If he can uncover Satoshi's key then he can truly claim to be Satoshi. This will give him a status that could allow him to influence bitcoin. He is a scoundrel. Imagine if he is truly considered the inventor...Imagine what he is likely to do with that power.
Or...I am just over-reacting. I sometimes take things too far. Hopefully this is nothing.
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:16:50
Actually, you gave me an insult. Your "philosophical argument" isn't even that. But I am not gonna waste any time explaining why.
I like how you assume I may use "trafficked girls." That was actually kinda funny. Silly and ignorant. But very funny.
Yes: my ultimate goal is to move away from the millions who cheat on their wives and husbands to the thousands who fuck little kids kidnapped from their parents. That is a REALLY good business idea. You seem smart. And super moral...the ultimate combo!!
Please....send more responses. You're funny.

Fair enough...you are still hung up on the women don't have to pay thing. I guess...you don't get it. I am not interested in ANY of that right now. I am ONLY interested in making a site that basically duplicates what Ashley Madison does...but uses bitcoin and no ID's.
You are hung up on women not paying. I get it. Now can we move on to the important stuff? Like....how do we set it up? Or....do you still wanna just sit there and think about how the whole idea is useless unless women get in for free? I feel like you are basically just hung up on women.

Hey...it was just a suggestion. As for circle-jerking...that sounds like something they did in the 70's. And it comes off as gross. I have no idea how what I am talking about relates to guys who may or may not be homosexual standing in a circle and masturbating.
But maybe that is your thing and it is often on your mind. Sounds weird. But whatever gets you through your day.

Probably it'll get out. And all that other stuff you wrote. But what I am interested in is people who wanna build this right now and invest in it right now.
Also, I do laugh at insults. So I am just comedically interested in other responses. But the main thing I am interested in is building this site very quickly.

Idk...I haven't come up with it yet. This post was about an idea I had this morning. I haven't worked all that out yet in the several hours since. I was kinda hoping some people would see my bitcoin commitment and offer to help or join.
But yeah...probably spam emailing everyone on the hacked database. And getting the word out other ways. But mainly that first one that you and I both mentioned....the spam thing.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:21:30
Alright then. So you're saying that you're not in, right?
Am I drunk? No. On drugs? No. Do I have 200 coins? Yes. Can I prove it? Yes.
Thanks for the business advice on a project that I thought of this afternoon and asked this subreddit about. I mean...of course I must have EVERYTHING worked by now...it's been almost 5 hours. Sheesh...I should have the second round if financing done by now and the beta version of the app up and running by now too, right?
What skills do I have? Idk...some skills. What can you do? I can play tennis pretty good. And I am pretty good at golf. I am decent at math....maybe even better than decent. Excellent at the quantum model as it pertains to the organic atoms. Awesome at Assemby language. Pretty good at parkour (but I do kinda get injured a lot doing it....so maybe not as good as I think). Pretty good point-guard in rec-league play. Adept at business. Idk...other stuff but those are some of the things I feel I am good at. Oh...pretty skateboarder...not X-games or anything...but definitely not gonna ever be embarrassed at the park. Oh...and I feel that I can still pitch pretty well...but I am very old now so I think I mostly just throw junk pitches. Still...kinda hard to hit for someone my age.
What are your skills? Also....what were my "promises" that you claimed I made?

"Their identity"?
Is there any chance you feel that a company invented bitcoin and is just waiting for the day that they can capitalize on it? If so, that seems even more far-fectched than my crazy ideas. But...I like it! I just don't believe it is the case.

Well, for the record, it looks like he is having an easy time operating.

I never said that you have to do all the work. You don't have to be involved. Just disregard this post. It is not for people like you. Also, just for the record: if you were actually interested in something like this, you could do it yourself...fake gracious allowance avoided.
*Edit: Thanks for deleting your post. Sometimes I feel bad for clowning on stupid things that people say. But I am reluctant to delete my posts...because I am rarely embarrassed. And rarely ever wrong.

That's the best insult you could deliver? Weak. Try harder.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:33:30
Yeah...that is what I was trying to explain to you...and everyone else like you. If you see a post with a stupid idea...just laugh at the stupid idiot and move on. Why does everyone feel so compelled to post insulting and derogatory things to someone who just asked a silly question?
Why can't you just...not start it? Did I ever respond to a question you asked with an insult? No. So when you do that to me, it makes me respond to you by being even more insulting than you were to me. Kinda like this....I am walking down the street and ask someone the time. They are pissed because I should know the time, so they punch me. I feel that I did nothing wrong, so I beat the shit out of them. People will stand around and watch this whole exchange, from my question about the time...to his punching me...to me dismantling him...and guess what? Everyone who witnessed it will be mad at me. How do I know? Because this has happened to me. And something similar happens to me on Reddit quite often. I ask a question. People insult me for my stupid question. I insult them better than they insulted me...other people join in...I insult them even better...everyone gets pissed at me. I never started it. I just finished it. People love to lob Internet insults. What they hate is when someone catches that lob and zing it back in their face 10 times harder than when they threw it at me.
Welcome to the new America. This is how it is now. I know...I am weird, right? How about this....? I feel that nearly everyone who responded DIRECTLY to me is weird. Look at my original post. Then tell me how that post deserves the insults and responses I got. I asked if anyone was interested in this idea. I offered to put 100 bitcoin into it if we got enough interest.  Yeah...that is definitely worthy of all the shit posts got. Your's included. Thanks for at least making me laugh...and...I guess....sorta...thanks for kinda apologizing...kinda....

Not easy to enforce KYC, actually. Bitcoin can be similar to cash if you tumble it, mine it, purchase it from Local Bitcoin...and other ways.
Also, it would be illegal for a first world government to create a competing currency. This would imply that the entire government​ was complicit without telling the public. It would also mean that the lucky first adopters won the lottery at the expense of everyone else.
Bitcoin is legit. Its creator was Satoshi. Satoshi is likely dead. But he will now live forever.

Yes. I considered this last week. I called Fidelity. I have a brokerage account with them. I explained everything I was going to do with the card. They told me that the card would give me points and not exactly cash back. Then they told me that it may give me 2% but was capped.
They also said that using it for international business purposes may or may not apply. Then I got frustrated and looked into my overall brokerage fees from them. So I withdrew nearly everything from Fidelity (other than my IRA) and have sold most equities and rebought them using Robin Hood.
Of course, now I spend way too much time daytrading on Robin Hood...
But yes...a very good idea. I just don't think it will work for my $2 million in Chinese purchase orders. And Fidelity is too stupid to give me a straight answer. Unfortunately this is how America is now...everyone is an idiot and no one really wants to hunt down the answers because...well...Millenials. Can you confirm that this card would do what you think it will? Because, if so, it is probably the closest I could get to an actual solution.
I also thought about just constantly getting whatever credit card existed that had a promotional period of 2% to 3% cash back and using them for my Alibaba orders that had banking issues. But this is a lot of research. But...maybe it is worth it.
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:32:37
I think you meant: "I'll belive it IF I see it."
Saying "when" sort of implies you already believe it.
My suggestion for you is to just assume it is Internet boasting. That way, you don't have to worry about about any possible exposure to "dross".
Or...and this may sound crazy...we could bet that it is not Internet boasting. Would you be willing to bet me...say...50 bitcoins if I can prove it? Or..and this may sound even crazier, how about you bet me 1,000 bitcoins and I give you 2 to 1 odds. That would be 2,000 bitcoins if it is just Internet boasting. We can find someone here that is trustworthy and put each of our respective coins into escrow. The winner takes it all.
I would be wiling to make my Alibaba log in and password available to you and the escrow agent to view. I will send you records of my bank transfers. And I will show you the deed to my farm. Oh..and you can come out and check us out if you're so inclined.
But my guess is you won't take either bet. No one ever bets me on Reddit. Ever.

I rarely use bitcoin to buy stuff. Tezors. I try to pay people in bitcoin..only one guy ever took it as a payment and it was only 10% of what I owed him. 
So...you are telling me that I can gamble...say $5k on a college game using bitcoin and it will be the exact same odds as Vegas? And it will cost me much less than one percent  in fees? Compared to 5% from online sites using fiat? Hmmm....now I wanna lose money gambling on sports.
@_date: 2016-09-20 22:53:20
I guess you're my Internet stalker now.
Also, I have a sense of humor. Just...you're not funny. You call me retarded. But...clearly I am not. So...how can that be funny? You are implying I am stupid. That is possible I suppose. I doubt it, though.
I don't live in a penthouse. Is there any chance you wanna just stop stalking me? I will put up with it if you absolutely must do it. But I will become more and more insulting to you over time. Also, you clearly are embarrassed by what you started. You are just one of those people who cannot stand to lose. The ironic thing is that you often lose.
@_date: 2016-09-18 06:14:25
Yeah...I am basically giving them nearly a 30 day business line of credit. I do sort of feel that using a credit card to purchase via Alibaba's escrow service would be the overall safest method.
Boots on the ground is not worth it. I go to China a couple of times per year. I meet with the suppliers and then maintain the relationships electronically (Skype and video). And we communicate 3 to 4 times per week usually. This is a year long project.
Alibaba's escrow is the only safety net I have.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:04:25
No...I want to pay the full 100 bitcoins. I want this guy to see his money vanish.

Well, I don't actually know anyone locally who is mining. In fact, I don't know anyone in San Diego who even knows what bitcoin is.
My "mining operation" is just my plan to place small rigs in my greenhouses out in the southern California desert. My greenhouses are running off grid (solar). My plan is to use the excess solar I have out there to run these. I have a lot of excess solar and a lot of excess battery storage for night time operation.
What are you looking to do? I will (probably) have the first miner up and running in the next several weeks. My goal is to see how much actual energy it consumes. How it runs overnight on the batteries. And see if it is worth scaling.
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:32:44
So, that will allow the suppliers in China to still purchase the raw materials they need for the build?
I don't think it will work for this purpose, unless I can get the entire supply chain on board with this method. My suppliers are very small Chinese companies and they need the money from my payment to purchase the raw materials to build my equipment. I was looking for a solution to solve this problem.
I agree that that 2 of 2 multi sif is a reasonable solution for something that I buy on a platform like Open Bazaar if I am buying some old records or a used golf set. But for a $60,000 order of newly built equipment, I don't think it will work for me...
But yes, I think you are basically correct about what you are saying.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:09:43
I am actually most interested in how you would be able to manage the cash flow for a supplier. If a supplier needs to be paid in order to begin building out the order, how would the buyer be protected if the supplier ran out of money before completing the build and just never shipped the order?
In the real world the buyer can sue the seller. If the seller doesn't have enough assets to cover the lawsuit then they file bankruptcy and the buyer may or may not ever get the ir money back.
Can Open Bazaar solve this problem? If so, I will route $2 million through your solution in the next 12 months.
@_date: 2016-09-18 03:33:40
It's not really the same thing as the Aliexpress.com payment service. They changed it somewhat recently.
I can speak Chinese pretty decently at least. Well...decent enough to get by. But most of these sites have English speakers. The main thing is still that the suppliers need my payment to purchase components for the things they build for us. This is the root cause of most of our problems.
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:03:15
You are so weird. So...let me get this straight: you think I am being a bitcoin dick because I won't post proof on Reddit of my returned payments using Alibaba?
Is there any chance that you're just crazy? You do know that you posted to me that I was lying about my payments to China, don't you? It was so unbelievably stupid that you would think I was lying about this that I decided to bet you that I wasn't lying. You do understand that this is all recorded in Reddit, right? Just read your posts.
What are you talking about with the SUPER IMPORTANT CEO thing? Where did that come from? Is there ANY chance you are confusing me with someone else? I never even mentioned anything about being a big time CEO.
Let me get this straight: you feel that I should have posted my Alibaba payments which were returned instead of just asking the community how to solve the payment problem using bitcoin?
"SUPER-ALIBABA-CEO-MAN"? Ummmm...seriously? That is the stupidest attempt at an insult I have seen in a while. You're seriously an idiot. You are funny with your stupidity. I will give you that. But still...wow...you are really stupid. I wonder what your life must be like....how fucking shitty is it? I know you won't share with me how lousy it is...but still...it has to be fucking bad.
My favorite part of this post is how you won't leave me alone until I post my Alibaba payments which were returned. That is the so weird..and, to be honest, a little creepy. I guess...I will just have to deal with you never relenting...because I am not going to post the returned payments here. They are not important. They are for real. I can assure you. The fact that you are so convinced that I would lie about a payment being returned is so weird.
Your metaphor at the end of your post about dogs and cats...man...you're so fucking dumb.
Anyhow, apparently I have an Internet stalker. I guess I can look forward to creepy rants and raves from you. Great.

@_date: 2016-09-18 03:53:35
I am building a small farm in the Southern California Desert. We are purchasing 65 container greenhouses from China. Some are 40'. Some are 20'. Each greenhouse is built in China. We are using several small companies to assemble these greenhouse because each greenhouse is unique. Some are using aquaponic technology. Some are using aeroponic technology.
Each component is is assembled by hand. We have our own designs that we worked on with each of these suppliers. The suppliers are small because we wanted it that way. There are really very few large suppliers for the type of stuff we want to build. And we needed a lot of attention from these suppliers (in design, mostly). So we negotiated a long term arrangement with each company to supply us these custom greenhouses. 
We are using each greenhouse for one year then we are selling them to small farms in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Afterwards, we are building permanent greenhouses out of concrete. These companies will then bring their people over from China and help us build these other structures of which there is a plan for 300 of them. So the long term opportunities for these small companies is pretty decent.
We do know what their margins are, basically, because we have already looked into the pricing of each component. These companies typically have 4 to 8 employees. And we account for 10% to 75% of their total business. One of these companies is a start-up that we basically helped get started.
Their margins will increase over time. We expect that. But they are willing to work at lower margins to secure our long term business. Each greenhouse uses the most modern equioment, solar, batteries, lighting, water treatment, etc.
For whatever it is worth, I bought the land and am using $2 million of my bitcoin profits to build this entire vertical farm in the desert. I wrote a lot about it here on this subreddit a few months ago.
@_date: 2016-09-18 09:37:43
Hasn't this been, basically, one of the "killer apps" that people have been talking about for a while now?
One of bitcoin's intrinsic properties is trust, I think. But how do you take advantage of this property? That is what we need.
Banking is becoming less and less trustworthy. Eventually it will collapse. I know that sounds crazy. But, in this subreddit, more people believe it...so I can mention it here and more people will agree.
I really can't withdraw a lot of my cash from my bank. My bank really controls my wealth, to some degree. They really are based on a fractional reserve and my money is socialized to all the banking losses which, for sure, are looming.
It would be great, I think, if I could place my bitcoins into an address for a purchase that will take 30 days to receive. If the supplier for this order could use those bitcoins to purchase the raw materials they need to build my order then that would be collateral that they could use to make those raw material purchases. No credit line that is based on the money that may or may not be in a bank.
And it could all happen in a matter of minutes as opposed to days. I guess it kinda sounds like Ethereum. But it's not that. It is bitcoin. The progenitor. The most trustworthy form of digital value ever created.
Someone needs to make the killer app. It is taking too long. I wish I ran bitcoin core. I wouldn't fuck around. I would make sure this stuff got done.

Suppliers are all 15 hours away from each other by car. And I don't want it pay a buyers agent to handle all of that.
Maybe 0.25% is too little..but it seemed reasonable to me. Maybe it isn't. I guess I just wish there were a solutiin. I can't be the only bitcoin guy who would love a service like I am talking about. But...I guess the only company that could solve it is Alibaba themselves. Maybe it will actually happen one day...but probably not cuz China is gonna outlaw bitcoin in my opinion. A competing currency sounds like a danger to nearly any first world government.

I spent 3 months in Singapore almost 20 years ago. It was so amazing. I almost moved there...but I just couldn't get over watching TV there and seeing kissing censored from all shows. It is really a great place. So modern. But they are not as open as I need to feel comfortable. I know it is different than it was 20 years ago. But still...some of that is still there.
Remember when they were going to cane that kid? That is so fucking backwards. I love to visit. I love the tax structure. The modernity. The heat and humidity is too much for me though. I am gonna get my citizenship in Switzerland. Dual citizenship in St Kitts. Maybe I will renounce my US citizenship if things get really bad.

But I can confirm my 2,000 bitcoins easily.

Too difficult to open a China bank account. But possible. That would probably make it easier to pay. Less transfers would be returned, for sure. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 23:16:34
It would have to bitcion, for starters. There is zero chance I could get Chinese suppliers to take Ethereum.
And the prediction marketplace kinda seems like squeezing the square peg into the round hole. I am not trying to be rude...I just don't think that I am going to get all suppliers to agree to this type of setup.
But...I like your general idea. It is different than anything else I have heard or even thought about!

I buy stuff for my business from Suppliers in China. I use Alibaba's escrow service.  Often, my payments are returned for what I feel is no reason. I pay via wire transfer of ACH. The ACH payments often have problems.
All of this is recorded in Alibaba and through my bank. It is quite easy to confirm and prove.
Yes...total of 3,000 bitcoins.

I feel that it is a good long term investment in real estate as well. I want to buy a place now. Then rent it as a vacation rental on VRBO or AirBnB. Use it when I go there for vacation. Then...possibly live there for a year or two if I can justify it. I just don't know if I could justify it. My work will probably be tough to manage from there. But you never know...
I know there is a lot of bitcoin going on there. If I actually had a real bitcoin company then I could probably somewhat justify it.

A letter of credit still exposes me to the supplier just running off with my money.
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:13:13
Ideally, yes. Or escrow if the seller can use my payment into the escrow account to borrow for 25 days so they can buy the raw materials.
Either way I just want protection from fraud. This is what Alibaba offers. They can do this because if the supplier screws over a customer, Alibaba can sue on my behalf. And the supplier is less likely to not deliver because they will be out of Alibaba's platform.
Also, Alibaba vets the suppliers and only allows real ones on their platform. Kinda like what Open Bazaar is looking to do.

Same with you. And for what it's worth, I just find it funny.
You do know that you went out of your way, first, to post to me? Right? I just found it funny so I now I am clowning on you. You are the one who keeps doing it.
And you do know that you posted to me telling me I was lying about my Alibaba orders, don't you? Then when I told you that you could make money off of me if I were lying...you got nervous. Now you just keep messaging me cuz..well...you're an idiot.
You see: I never contacted you out of the blue to accuse you of lying. You contacted me to accuse me of lying. I am not lying. In fact, only an idiot would even think that someone who is having issues with transferring money to China is lying about it.
You're acusation was so stupid and so unexpected that I felt that...since you're an idiot...maybe I can take your money as well.
My guess is that you enjoy the attention. So, in a way, I am doing you a favor.
Wanna bet me, by the way? Are you 100% certain that I am lying about my banking issues with my Chinese suppliers? The other idiot here claims he will bet me that I am lying. Maybe you wanna jump in on the bet?
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:36:26
I am admitting that I did not lie. You just popped out of the ether and accused me of lying. I never contacted you. So...no...you are wrong. I am not trying to scam anyone. I am trying to make a bet with you.
A bet is not a scam. Both parties think they are right...but only one of them is ACTUALLY right. So they bet and the winner takes the money from the loser. Betting has been around for thousands of years. I am surprised that you have never heard of it.
Also, yes, I am funny.
@_date: 2016-09-18 03:16:20
Banking regulations are a pain in the ass when sending money overseas. Have you ever tried to buy something for $60k in China? It isn't easy..unless you are Walmart or a large company.
Sometimes it is smooth and easy. Other times it is a giant pain. Chase may close my account because of my bitcoin exchange purchases and Chinese wire transfers. Banking nowadays is not the same as it used to be.
Bank of America closed my account because of my daily Coinbase transactions. If Chase closes my account then I am in trouble. They have made it so that I don't ever use Coinbase anymore out of fear of not having a bank account anymore. 
Also, I tried to take $11k out of my bank account last month. They told me it would take 4 business days to approve that. Wow...that is scary. Where, exactly, is my money? What are they doing with it? The funny thing is that they would close my account and not give me cash but a cashiers check...I would be stuck with a cashiers check that I could never deposit...because I am pretty sure that if I had 2 banks close my accounts then there is no bank that would take me as a customer.
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:42:10
That is the funniest you could come up with? Try again. Make it funnier.
@_date: 2016-09-18 03:18:25
But the supplier cannot use the payment to purchase the components they need to build my equipment, right? They would need to use their own money and when the goods finally arrive and go trough customs then they would get paid, correct?
If so, this will not work for my suppliers. Most are small and my orders are large for them. Too large for them to front the money for the components themselves.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:42:08
I would pay 0.25% for a viable solution. I feel that this is reasonable. But...I don't think it is possible for us because, like I wrote, our suppliers need the money before they order components for the build.
Also, dang...you started a lot of bitcoin businesses. That is awesome. I am about to start mining. But that isn't really creative. I appreciate what people like you are trying to do for us. Thanks!
Reading gambling: I always thought that a start-up should charge zero for all bets and make no money at all until their community hit a certain size...then SLOWLY start to implement fees. I LOVED InTrade. I spent a lot of money on that site until they were shut down. I wish there were something like that (with a large community) using bitcoin for all those bets. I know there are small players...but I want to win $20k on a bet...not $20.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:39:58
u/UniversalSnip has posted that he wants to pull out of the bet. I apologize for the time that may have been wasted here.
I know this is unlikey...but I will keep the bet open to anyone else who wants to make it. But I doubt anyone is interested.
Again, my apologies for the time. u/UniversalSnip should delete his Reddit account. When you go out of your way to make such a bet, you should follow through on it...or at least apologize for wasting people's time. You agreed to this bet. You have a legitimate and long standing account. I get that you were jealous of me. That is human nature. But when you put your name to something, you should stick with it..or apologize for being wrong.
@_date: 2016-09-18 02:59:28
Good ideasm, actually. I do have several trustworthy friends in China. But it won't work because the suppliers need the money immediately to purchase the components for what they build for us.
Alibaba will never take nitcoin, in my opinion. The government would freak out. Many suppliers would like to be paid in bitcoin so they can acquire bitcoins without having to go through Huobi or OKCoin.
I work with small suppliers but some of them have owners who want to move money out of China.
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:35:53
You are right. But Alibaba offers escrow and this Alibaba escrow allows my suppers to use escrowed payment to make a material purchases. Of course, that is Alibaba...bitcoin is known by almost no one.
Thanks for post. I guess I just wish there a way to solve the problem.
@_date: 2016-09-18 00:35:24
Thanks for the advice. This is usually what happens on Alibaba:
1) I order something from China and it takes a week to build and 12 days after that to arrive by boat
2) I must pay when I order
3) Alibaba will get the money back for me if the order does not arrive (usually after 30 days) or the order was totally incorrect
A bitcoin escrow service will keep the money in an address that no one can touch until the deal is completed and products are received. Many small suppliers need the money to order the parts to build the order. At least with Alibaba the supplier can use the funds before they start to build. If they screw over the buyer them Alibaba finds a way, somehow, to get the money back. I assume they will just sue the seller on my behalf and kick them out as a supplier afterwards.
Sometimes I wonder if bitcoin can compete...I really want it to. But...it is SUCH a pain to use sometimes. If there is total trust between 2 parties then it is great. If not...then you need regular money. How likely would it be that a court would even hear a case where a seller used bitcoin to purchase something and it never arrived? You would need a standard contract and then be able to prove the payment was made via bitcoin.
Maybe it just isn't there yet. Bummer. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 08:16:26
I don't believe you. You're not funny. Even though you try. I do have 2,000 bitcoins. I will bet you at 2 to 1 odds if you place 1,000 into escrow.
To confirm: you feel I am lying about my banking transfers to China from my Alibaba purchases. Correct? Also, it seems that you believe I don't have 2,000 bitcoins. So, when I deposit these into the escrow account that will confirm it. Correct? You also agree to make this whole bet public? And we both agree to pay the escrow guys a total of 100 bitcoins. Correct?
Please confirm so that I can post this to this subreddit tomorrow morning. I would expect that it will go to the top and stay there for a while. It should take only one day to confirm everything from my Alibaba account. How about we include Zane Tackett as one of the escrow guys? He seems to have a pretty solid reputation here. And we will need at least one other trustworthy person.
Confirm that you agree with all of this and I will set it up. If you are just trying to be silly, then I suggest you stop messaging me. If you would like to increase the bet amount, I am ok with that as well. I will keep the 2 to 1 odds.
You must have at least 1,000 bitcoins for this bet. If you don't have that many coins then you must have at least 50 bitcoins for my original bet. This bet will be 1 to 1 odds. And we will give 80% of the winnings to the escrow guys. Agreed?
Oh...one other thing: if you lose your bet that it means that you were 100% incorrect. I will need you to make a post within 24 of losing to admit that you contacted me out of the blue to insult me without any provocation. You will also need to admit that you bet me I was lying and that you lost that bet. If I lose, then you get my bitcoins (minus 100) and I must post within 24 hours admitting that I lied and lost a bet to you. Agreed? I am going to guess that you won't agree..for the record.
Are you good at anything? I would be willing to let you make a series of other bets with me as well if you lose to recover your losses. One-on-one basketball game to 32? A one mile race on a track? A final exam in any STEM graduate level class? Your total equity investment returns from 2000 through today vs mine? No video games...cuz I don't play. Best of 3 sets in a tennis match? One round of golf? 100 meter freestyle swimming race?
See..I am a fair person. I usually don't enjoy taking people's money. Even though you are kind of a dick (cuz you insulted me out of the blue...unprovoked). I know nothing about you. But I am wiling to keep your money (minus the escrow fee) in escrow if you want to win it back by beating me in any of those challenges. If you lose again, you owe me nothing extra, but then your bitcoins will be released to me.
What do you say? Oh...hold on....I am guessing you thought a lot about what to say...and it will be a VERY feeble attempt at humor and insult.
Awaiting your response.

So, for us the problem of releasing funds over time wont6work. Our suppliers need to purchase everything immediately and then assemble for about a week. Then they put it on a boat to Long Beach, CA. They need basically all of our payment. At least 80% of it right away. Then it takes about 3 weeks to arrive on my farm.
I just want too protect my $60k purchase in case they were to screw me over. But they need the money before they build. It seems like it is not solvable unless I am missing something?
Do yiu think that one of your bitcoin businesses will ever take off? I think of bitcoin start-ups probably everyday. I haven't come up with something I feel totally comfortable with yet. Well...when Ashley Madawaska hacked I got a few programmers together and we built a bitcoin version. A group of investors in Germany bought it from us...but I didn't make much from that..so I am not gonna count that.
Maybe my mining operation will be successful...but I am going to start very small because I am not sure how it will do.
I went to bustabit. I don't like games. But it looks like a lot of people could get into it. I like making social bets. Like who is gonna win an election....will a certain thing happen...stuff like that. InTrade type bets. I wonder how you could get more people interested in your site...? I guess it would take a lot of marketing, basically. Basically a lot of money...or time. Also...wow..200 btc in one day is impressive!  How can you make everyday like that?
I am rooting for you! I so badly want bitcoin to actually become a thing. Not just digital gold.

All of this can easily be learned, if you review the public curriculum of many undergrad and grad programs and copy what they do.
It just depends on the the person. Most people just can't focus enough to read all the books in a CS undergrad program and do all the assignments. They could do it. But most of them would need a life-changing event to focus and motivate them...like surviving a plane crash.
Life is so awesome now. You guys are so lucky. All this knowledge is freely available and easy to find.
Anyhow, it can be done without attending college. You just need to live after your plane crashes.
@_date: 2016-09-18 01:34:47
Excellent recommendations and advice. Yes, we visit nearly all of our suppliers. But some of them we have never seen in person. We just have to trust their Alibaba ratings. The issue with most Chinese suppliers is that they work on VERY slim margins. A $60,000 order will usually net them about 6% profit. For us, about 90% of the cost is components and the other 10% is labor. I could probably send them 85% initially...but why bother.
This is the reason I just put a small supplier out of business. They bought about $110k worth of components assuming the $125k would arrive in a few days. It kept being returned to my bank account and the wire transfer failed twice. I was reluctant to spend 2.8% for the credit card option....so now they are out of business.
I guess PayPal is here to stay. And I guess that Alibaba's escrow service is the only option. I just hate that it takes a week for funds to arrive to the suppliers' bank accounts. And I hate that the funds are often returned to me because of financial regulations. I feel it is a huge waste of money to put it on my credit card for nearly 3% extra.
I guess...invest in BABA. I am a small business. I cannot find a US supplier that can compete with the Chinese suppliers...and Alibaba's escrow service, while slow, is guaranteed.
If Open Bazaar could get all of the Chinese Suppliers on their site with reviews and ratings then I would feel more comfortable using Open Bazaar. But if I can pay via wire transfer on Alibaba for no fee and they still guarantee my purchase order....then...well....I might as well just use Alibaba's escrow service. It is a pain. A third of my orders encounter problems. But at least I am protected. Protection is the most critical.
If the supplier needs the money right away to cover costs...Bitcoin escrow can't work, unless I am missing something. If I use PayPal then it costs nearly 3% (for the buyer or seller...one of them ha to pay) but the supplier gets the money quickly. I guess..invest in PYPL too.

They wrote that exponentially increasing systems in nature are always unstable. But many things grow exponentially for a long time until they begin to level off to linear growth or even slower. But things grow exponentially for a LONG time, quite often, with no instability.
Anyhow, don't worry about it. They wrote it incorrectly so I was pretty sure they were just guessing that things can't grow at this rate naturally. I just don't like to read incorrect info. People tend to believe whatever they read so I was trying to make sure no one thought that a system growing at this rate was unstable.
@_date: 2016-09-19 03:30:28
You also seem nice, like the other guy.
My guess is that you are the other guy, with one of your many different reddit accounts.
Here is what happened: I wrote a post asking if people knew of a way to solve a problem I was having with money transfers. He (probably you) contacted me out of the blue and called me a liar. A LIAR for asking a question about how to send money to China.
So...yeah...I bet him I wasn't lying. I wasn't lying about asking the question. I wasn't lying about anything, actually.
"Profound commitment to charity"? You do know that you could just use regular words and insult me for being stupid, don't you? Either way, you are the same person as the "other guy". You don't want to bet me..I get it. You shouldn't. Because I will win. Publicly. And I will take your bitcoins.
The bet can DEFINITELY happen. And I cannot welch on it. I would have to put the 2,000 bitcoins into escrow. The person managing the escrow would have to give the money to the winner. You have no idea what you are talking about because you (you..who are the same as the original dick) are an idiot.
I would recommend just letting it go. Or...if you also believe that I am making up the fact that I was looking for a way to transfer money to China using bitcoin then you can also bet me. But....you will either just stop messaging me or you will send another stupid message to me that is comical...and you will try to use big words to express your intelligence. The problem is that you are not intellient. You're a fool. Only a fool would post to me the way that you have.
Only a fool would be pissed that I wrote a post asking about how to transfer money to China using bitcoin. And only an idiot would have two accounts pretending to be two separate people...both of whom attack me for lying about something that NO ONE would ever lie about.
Or..."both" of you can bet me and I'll take "both" of your bitcoins.
Thanks for being a dick. Thanks for logging into Reddit and insulting me out of the blue when I never started anything with you or your alter ego. Now...message me back and apologize. Or message me back and be a dick again so I can laugh some more. Or bet me. Or...I recommend that you just go back to lurking elsewhere.
If you wanna bet then let's get it started. I feel that it would make it to the top of Reddit if we made it public. It would be great entertainment for thousands of people. And I will finally get my Reddit bet that I have been trying to get for a while now.
Here is how it would go: 2 or 3 trusted people here would manage the escrow. I will put 2,000 bitcoins into the escrow account. You and your alter ego will put 1,000 into escrow. We will pay the escrow team...hmm....I am generous...let's pay them 100 bitcoins. Then I will give them (and you) my Alibaba log-in and password. You will see the invoices paid and how they were paid. Plus the dates they were paid. Then...you will lose your 1,000 bitcoins. I will take your 900 bitcoins that are left over after the 100 bitcoin fee and I will open my first Bitfinex account. I will play gamble with that money as if it weren't mine. I will make the most aggressive leveraged bets that I have always wanted to make but couldn't because I was too nervous. And I will make all these bets public here in this subreddit and in Bitcoin Markets.

Bitcoin may end up just being a get rich kinda quick scheme. There is no guarantee that it will stick around forever. I personally hope it does. It has such a great story behind it. And the concept is perfectly timed for where the world is right now.

I just spent a little time on your site. I have some questions, if you have some time to discuss.

The "crypto space" has kind of been around for, at least, several years. I see way over 1,000 "players" now. Will there be over 10,000 when it finally does get started? If so...how am I gonna choose from 10,000? Anyhow, don't worry about it. I'm sorry for dismissing your coin so readily. I did look into NavCoin but it didn't seem to fit what I was looking for. Thanks!

We believe in bitcoin. Blockchain is just an insecure, distributed database when it's not decentralized. Hopefully that answers your question.
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:18:01
It will power one miner (probably with some extra power but not enough for two miners). You will also receive 50% of your total investment in solar/batteries/inverters/racks over the course of about 6 years (in tax credits).
In my opinion, this is worth it. It is worth it because bitcoin mining is based on your cost to cool and your cost of electricity. If you cool efficiently and you're in a good zone for solar then you'll probably spend even less than what I told you. Plus you'll get about half your investment back in tax credits. Meanwhile, your miner will be chugging away at zero cost.
If bitcoin crashes then you have enough power to take a small home completely off-grid. In Southern California, that's worth about $200 per month...maybe more. In the Summer you'll be cranking out LOTS of watts so you could easily run an air conditioner all the time...and lots of other stuff.

I'm working on a real estate project in San Diego as well. It is a GIANT pain in the ass to get it off the ground here. Regulations and whatnot.
I like it when I see people outside of "tech" working on blockchain projects (or at least seriously considering them). Kinda like how I work on real estate projects but I am not, primarily, in that field. Basically, I think it provides some people a different perspective on the applications that hard-core tech people might have a hard thinking about.
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:48:09
Pleased to meet you as well. I am always happy to chat about ideas with those who are truly interested in these things. But I can tell you that what I work on is usually kind of "fringe" and almost no one would have any interest in it.
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:16:21
Oh...natural gas for power. I thought about that but it's a pain. I use solar. Thanks for the response.
I am not onTelegram, but my bitcoin-related businesses are the following: (1) solar bitcoin mining in the desert (2) I am developing a blockchain-based logistics solution for farm-to-table farmers (3) bitcoin ATM's in SoCal
Oh...and I guess there's a fourth business: day-trading using using algorithmic analysis of numerous nearly-real-time data troves.
Thanks again for the post. I hope it is read by a lot of people.
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:05:43
$8-10k total in solar/batteries/inverter/racks (do your own labor). 30-ish panels at about 350w each and 15-20 lead acid batteries at 12V/200ah.
This is for a Zone 1 area. I am doing it now. You'll need to shop around for the best pricing. I buy from China, using Alibaba. BlueSun is pretty reasonable.
Use DC power directly if you know what you're doing. You'll thank me for this piece of advice.
Oh, and this is enough extra power for cooling, but you'll need to be smart about cooling. If you're willing to dunk the entire miner in a dielectric solution then you'll shave more off of cooling. You won't have to run the fans as well and this will shave about 65w also.
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:16:58
I also love Prague! As for the Ukraine developers, you're right. But I spend time in Prague and I was hoping to start a project here since I spend a good amount of time here.
@_date: 2018-07-16 00:44:49
Would you mind briefly explaining what you are doing? My first question is your "cash as a service". Can you briefly explain this part to me?
And my bitcoin ATM business will be very unique...and is not likely to be very compatible with your model (unless I am misunderstanding your website). I am looking to destroy the bitcoin ATM business in SoCal by self-funding everything and providing deposits and withdrawals at all of my ATM's at a flat 1% fee.
@_date: 2018-07-05 21:52:58
Thanks for the response! But I will need to make use of an established blockchain. Perhaps NavCoin will persist through the ages. But I cannot commit resources to such an unlikely blockchain. No offense intended, whatsoever. Thanks again for writing!!
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:05:06
I LOVE that you dream in blockchain! I often do as well!
My career is focused on biotech but I spend a significant amount of time with my other businesses as well. My other businesses are almost all related, in some way, to the blockchain. I'm in SoCal. What about you? And what's your current project (other than this bitcoin-mining-cave you wanna start)? I have LOTS of little projects in the works now.
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:58:56
I would never sell any code for trading because I would feel UNBELIEVABLY horrible if someone used it and lost money. Also, it is based on my research in my primary field of bioinformatics...so I can't have anyone stealing what I have worked years to develop.
Regarding my performance using this software, I would say that it is very good.
As for Prague, I just returned yesterday. I had a VERY difficult time meeting with developers. It turns out that the Czech economy is on fire and developers are in high demand there right now. Especially blockchain developers. But I believe that I will find some by the end of Summer, which is when I plant to start my business in Prague.
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:05:29
I liked your post. May I ask how you're mining? What kind of "mining cave" are you going to set up? Are you going to go EXTREME and build something super-modern/super-efficient?
And I agree about the next next halvening. This is bound to have a substantial effect on bitcoin's value.
I am in three bitcoin-related businesses right now and I see a LOT of increased interest and commitment, by developers, in this space. Anyhow, thanks for the post.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:07:45
Also, you didn't read my post. Just my title. Maybe read the post before you respond to something totally unrelated to the post.

One of them is on board. How about this, since you think I am lying: bet me right here. I say I am not lying. You say I am. Let's publicly bet. I bet you 100 bitcoins. If I am lying then you get 100 coins. If I am not then we make it public and you just pay me 1 bitcoin. 100 to 1 odds. All public.
What do you say?
@_date: 2015-11-27 04:34:17
No. No one pays for Uber with bitcoin. So...no. OpenBazaar is based on bitcoin. I am talking about an Uber disruptor.
But I love the idea of OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:04:33
No. It is not just digital cash. Who told you that? It has a block chain. And cash is based on gov't  fiat while bitcoin is based on nothing even remotely similar to gov't fiat.
Cash is possible to use for tax avoidance. But if everyone switched to real cash then the gov't would run out of cash in a few minutes. I feel that you didn't really think this thing through before you wrote it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:25:21
I think bitcoin could offer some protection. And capitalism won't fail long term. It'll just be a painful several years. Bitcoin is likely​ to help those who hold them.
Well...that's my guess on all this.

Oh. My bad. I had a hard time understanding your post. Too much turkey...
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:40:10
Everything is based on my own research. My primary businesses are based on data mining and this is, essentially, my background. I mostly trade bitcoin (as opposed to alts) since this is where my heart is.
Right now, I mostly code using Python but that's only because I use it in my primary work (genetic analysis).
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:14:20
Ahhh...ok. Well, thanks for saving me 120 bitcoins. I guess....you win. Damn...so embarrassing for me. And saintly of you.
Also, for the record: you don't understand escrow. This is odd for a lawyer. Your excuse for not betting me is that you don't believe me. Ummm...my bet is based on that.
Ugh...Internet people are the funniest. Is anyone on this sub interested in the original point of my post? Or...can ANYONE who wants to be a dick actually be funny?
@_date: 2015-11-27 02:55:38
Well, the reputation system would be built into the app, of course. That was implied. And 5 years...? No. That is way too long. All it needs is for unemployed people to find out about it. An open-source Uber would make more money for drivers. And be cheaper for riders. That is good enough to make it grow quickly (if the app works well).
You do understand that Uber makes money off of each ride, don't you? If there were no middle-man then it would grow and beat all competitors. Why?....Cuz it's the same type of driver...but no middle man...and the same review system for drivers.
@_date: 2015-11-27 04:15:48
Very little will be word of mouth. It'll be viral cuz of the internet. Things don't really have a word of mouth growth rate anymore. Cuz it's 2015 now and the Internet is here.
Even if there is no open source, community project to replace Uber, there will be a company that provides the app for free to riders and $99 per year for drivers. When that happens...Uber is doomed. They either buy this company to kill it (briefly, before another one pops up) or they drop their prices to compete, thus destroying their market value.
Either way: Uber ain't ever gonna be really worth $100 billion. Not for real.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:56:59
No. Almost no one uses bitcoin for that. They use it as an investment. You're not in.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:59:48
I feel that many kids don't have pagers. Also, paging is a standard. It'll work on Motorola pagers and other pagers as well. How can you be a pager-hacker and not know this...? Hmm.....something tells me you are making up your hacking skills...
But yeah, it's a killer idea either way.
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:58:28
Basically, I just feel that an app that combines a map and links unemployed people with cars isn't worth $100 billion. And this is the problem with our over--inflated economy. Can someone recreate Uber? Yes. How do I know? Lyft.
 Can someone write an app and charge a one--time fee of $99 per year for a driver? Yeah, probably. Will that happen? Yeah, probably. 
Can someone "Wikipedia" Facebook and Twitter? Yeah. When those companies annoy millenials, a free app that connects these idiots together will be made. When people finally realize that their data is being kept and is accessible by the gov't then they will begin to switch to the free service that doesn't save anything. When Facebook is hacked and people realize what Facebook and Twitter are selling to companies, they will be pissed and jump ship. That's my opinion.
These are apps. I mean....they're just fucking apps. Anyone can write them. MySpace, Friendster, Facebook....you see what I mean? $100 billion for a company that writes an app that links a guy with a car to a guy that needs a ride. Wow...impossible to recreate....our economy is doomed.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:03:47
In many ways...yeah.
For example, this project would not have happened without China (and Alibaba).

I wanted him to make the bet public. But when reality hit him, he got scared.
Someone should take me up on this bet...you all do know there is a chance I am making it all up, right? Isn't there a bitcoin millionaire here who is willing to risk just 500 btc to just shut me the fuck up? Anyone....?
People here do know that I will disappear forever out of shame if someone just puts up their money to make this bet. It's so simple... you already know I am lying...what is holding you all back?

There is NO way Uber can be worth $100 billion. And I believe you are right about what happened in NYC. But I still believe Uber will be Wikipedia'd.
The majority often publicly outcries but the politicians do nothing. But yeah..NYC was gonna go viral via main stream media if they had halted Uber's growth. I feel that is the ONLY reason it happened.
Look at the public outcry in Chicago now. Nothing will change there. Outcries don't always work.

You're wrong. My farm is quite profitable. I now have 25 new miners that I own and cost me zero. I now have solar and battery infrastructure to support those 25 miners and they cost me zero. So...I am confused as to how you think it is a bad business idea. I sorta take pride in knowing that I made this all on my own and still...no one gets it.
What is your better idea for my money? We can see how your idea would have done vs my mining setup. Maybe your ideas are better. There is very little chance that this will turn out of the best investment in the world. But...for sure...it is profitable.
I am willing to hear how you have made money, if you'd like to share.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:00:27
I sell on eBay. And I just sell the produce to employees at a hospital in San Diego right now. I am in the process of growing the farm so I don't sell to others yet.
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:11:03
Yeah. My idea is kinda like a lending club. But it uses bitcoin to bypass ALL the stupid regulations associated with banking.
Basically: the gov't doesn't wanna classify bitcoin as a currency cuz they're scared of that...so we will take advantage of that for now. Basically, the gov't made it so that we can become a lending club with no regulation. Thank you,  US gov't!

Sure. But it has to be after all the bets are in. If people wanna give you money...that is even better!
I will likely be having all parties who are gonna bet me invited out there at one time. Including the escrow agents so they can confirm it all in person.
Try to get people here to give you money. That would mean that you and I just created an opportunity from my post. If someone gives you money...something magical just happened directly from my post. I don't expect it to happen...but man...if it did...wow.
I am hoping someone pays you. If you're cool then you can be the actual guy who records it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:21:40
I didn't realize we were arguing. Maybe that is your core problem...you made an incorrect assumption. We are not arguing.
Of course I can give a photo. My "mining rig" is a few miners in a greenhouse. They are sitting on a shelf and have a vent pointed at them.

If you look up suppliers on Alibaba instead of AliExpress, you will find some who will ship smaller quantities. I pay this rate because I ship by the container. It costs about $1500 to bring a 20' container from China to San Diego. I buy in volume so that is my pricing.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:03:39
I won't be screwed. I will switch my solar from bitcoin mining to farming. I have extra greenhouses I can bring online at any moment. I just need power.
Others could do the same thing, but with another application for electricity.
I tried to explain to people that a big portion of this is based on my faith in btc. You ain't got the same faith? This ain't for you.

@_date: 2017-07-01 01:28:05
Bitmain is not evil. They are capitalistic. The world is free. They should be able to do what they want. If bitcoin cannot survive capitalism then it is flawed and we need to start over.
My greenhouse is a separate business. I have a vertical farm in the desert and I run 3 or 4 miners in each greenhouse since they already have HVAC and are very well insulated. 
I don't sell back to the grid because it isn't worth it. I would consume 15 hours per day of grid power...at $0.43 per kwh. My idea is better. Trust me. Thanks for the upvote! 
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:04:32
Maybe. My models tell me that mining is more profitable. But models are often based on hope.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:47:39
I'll post some. There is likely to be some idiot who just can't take it that I am so brazen in my lies. This guy will hopefully bet me. Then I will post the pics.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:25:49
You won't. Sometimes others do.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:36:43
Weird? I wonder if that is how he incites people to bet him....
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:57:17
Around where we are now. That is the big asterisk in this model. But like I keep saying, we all believe, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:28:53
Not bad.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:59:30
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:17:58
Sure. We can meet anywhere. I'll likely be on campus that day.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:11:39
That is what I was trying to explain to everyone.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:05:39
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:40:41
Lead acid, AGM. And yes, I have looked into Lithium batteries but the costs are not there yet for me.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:41:29
Yes. Just look at my posts regarding the solar mining in the desert.  They are filled with people who don't believe me. And we documented the last bet.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:46:29
I gave you enough. Either take it or leave me alone. But stop acting as if I need to arrange my schedule around some asshole on the Internet who says he has to see my operation or he won't believe me.
Just...think about what you are demanding. And then ask yourself, "what right do I have to demand that this very busy man rearrange his busy schedule to accommodate me?"
Again, the offer still stands. But no...I am not gonna try to rearrange my life to give you the 5 days heads up to come out. Read your posts to me. Wtf? Is everyone this delusional? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:37:04
Yes. I feel that this is one thing miners don't want everyone to know. The solar mining...yeah..I believe I am not the only one doing this.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:08:11
Look at my previous post for yesterday. It may still be in the front page. A lot of that info is there. If you have specific questions, I will try to answer.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:30:47
My numbers are real and current.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:39:37
Because I am using the economic model instead of the energy model you are talking about. Basically, I make more money by diverting the energy to the batteries for later use at night than I would by selling back to the grid.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:26:35
I just mean, it is going up to $10k within 3 years. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:28:03
You will see it. For the record,  it is not an amazing video. But it proves what I am telling people here.
I need the community to understand how some people are trying to control the narrative here. There really is a reason that my posts about showing everyone my bitcoin mining project are being down voted. You do understand that it should be at the top, right? Because if you are interested in bitcoin then you would be very interested in seeing a solar array powering a mining operation.
I need to prove one VERY big thing. Then I will post it.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:15:33
Depends on when I bought them. If I could have times everything perfectly like most investors then I would have made more just trading. But my time machine is still broken...so I am doing it this way.
It is always funny when people point to how bad I am with my money because I was unable t predict the future the way that most other people clearly can.
I don't mean this in a rude way...it is just a theme here that everyone has a better way for me to have invested my money.
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:53:20
Good.  I will make use of you when I need you then. I hope you are vocal when I need you to be.
Also, invitation still stands.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:46:18
Let's meet today.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:59:47
You mostly get it. I can only go off of what I believe will happen and what I have seen happen since the beginning, with regards to the price of btc. I feel it is headed up. This forms a basis for my business plan.
Also, in a year, bitcoin is likely to rise. If it doesn't, then it is likely to rise within 2 years. I can switch my solar to farming if that happens. I can personally make use of the solar, regardless. Others could do the same. You could put a 6kw solar system on your house and just mine bitcoin. Then, if bitcoin craps out you can just use the power for your home. This is just one of millions of uses for electricity.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:06:27
Of course I looked at the Power Wall 2. Way too expensive. Chinese lead acid is WAY cheaper. 100%.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:37:00
The numbers are in my previous posts. The pictures are in the posts before that.
@_date: 2017-07-02 04:06:25
I never renege on an bet. Ever.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:00:25
Good thing you are not my accountant.
I wonder how I blunder through life just making money...it must really bother some people.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:47:19
Thanks. I appreciate that.  But my intention with these posts was just to pay back the sub for allowing me an opportunity to fund this project with bitcoin.
I decided to pay back the sub-reddit with all the info on how I spent the money and what became of it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:42:21
We are always looking to hire. What is your special set of skills?
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:57:02
I also mine other currencies. I just don't discuss that here very often.
 I am down voted because there is something fishy in this sub.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:57:57
We don't use co2 in most of our greenhouses because we are mostly aquaponic. The co2 will kill the fish.
Our aeroponic greenhouse does use co2.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:52:54
Your math is wrong. Look it up again.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:18:46
And I already grow micro greens.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:25:10
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:18:09
Like...someone is gonna assassinate me?
No. That won't happen. Even the guy who hates me the most for losing 300 btc to me ain't gonna kill me or have me killed.
Maybe one of my ex's however...
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:00:36
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:58:24
You keep assuming that I owe you something. I am pretty nice. And I stick by what I say. You are invited. But you are an asshole. I would prefer you not come out and just wait for the pictures and video I will post this week.
But if you insist then, like I wrote, I will give you as much of a heads up as I can. At least 2 days. If you can't deal with that then...I don't care. I am offering more than I should to a guy who is really undeserving. 
When you come out, maybe you can change my opinion of you. But either way, you can see it. My main farm is in Blythe. I have 7 greenhouses there. I have two in Borrego but we areally moving them all to Borrego this Summer. I am building out my solar thus Summer.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:22:33
I can also only confirm things I am intimately familiar with.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:59:27
Now...let's say I don't do what you demanded? Now what are you gonna do?
I wonder why you are so mad? Weird.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:32:58
He is pretty sure you and I are the same person.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:35:09
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:15:30
Should be "avec".
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:04:02
I guess I disagree with your estimation of 25% efficiency. I don't know what else to say...it really is working.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:51:25
Search harder.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:58:59
Cuz you asked. And I am usually polite.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:31:51
True. I had sun fatigue last week. I was sick for a day after. The desert is not really my place. But it truly is beautiful.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:28:49
Of course. No one would want to see it. Hence the lack of interest.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:04:19
You're taking his post the wrong way. He was really taken by my post and he spent hours crafting this hilarious and well-written satire.
It is the highest form of praise.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:47:16
It is a mini split attached to a 40' container.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:29:48
Then I guess it is the nasty kind.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:25:02
It scaled fom one miner to twenty-five. And one greenhouse to seven. Seems pretty linear so far.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:17:31
No. You might as well mine if they are sitting in your warehouse. You do understand that...right?
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:46:16
No subsidies from these suppliers. Don't sweat it, mighty taxpayer. I didn't plunder your loot with these solar panels from China!
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:02:48
I do that as well but I do not discuss alts here very often. Those numbers are better than my btc numbers...
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:14:56
I know that. But again, you did not read my post correctly. Don't sweat it. I detailed the requirements for the greenhouse in my post, but you just didn't see those numbers or you didn't understand them when I explained it.
It sounds like you think I am lying. If it that big of a deal, go look through my posts from the last several days and read the OP. You will see where I detailed what is needed for the greenhouses.
I am not full of crap. You just didn't read very well. Don't worry about it...not everyone  is as detailed as me.
Either way, you seem nice.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:58:13
No apologies necessary. Now I am feeling bad. My apologies to you. I will provide pictures.  I always do.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:25:43
That is what I am counting on.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:00:07
No. Are you?
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:53:24
So....no one thinks it's weird that this post is being so down voted?
Nobody (except that one guy) wants to see it? Kinda seems strange. But I suppose there is a chance that a solar mining operation that is profitable is not really that big of a deal to the bitcoin community.
Yeah, that makes sense. I don't know what I was thinking. No one really cares about bitcoin stuff in a bitcoin sub. What do you guys mostly talk about? I only come here sporadically. Mistakenly, I thought bitcoin mining and ways to do it profitably might be a topic for this sub...but it isn't.  Where would one go if they wanted to discuss stuff like that? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:41:39
Still...I don't wanna give you any money. But this invitation is still likely open to you. Just, please do not hit me up for money if you come out. I am kinda over people from Reddit asking me for donations.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:17:20
Unless he isn't...
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:04:40
100% solar and batteries. No connection to the grid at all.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:03:28
You're making this up.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:05:05
I posted much of that in the original post about my update earlier today. Look it up if you care.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:33:58
That's OK with me. But it is not my intention. I feel that you just misunderstand me.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:31:56
 I have a well.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:02:31
But you saw the pictures.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:00:25
What do you wanna talk about? Let's just talk here. No one is looking this far down on this post anymore. What's up?
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:29:52
I can't decipher what you are asking me. Sorry.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:30:17
I am up. And I own the solar now. For me, it was a big win.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:39:13
Well...even if you dislike me..I love your user name!!
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:21:11
I know. It is hard for many peple to undertstand how numbers work. Try not to get too bogged down in the numbers or you may get a headache.
I am gonna try to explain it very simply. I consider a good profit margin to be at least 50% net profit. Now, if I sell $100 and I make $60 in net profit. This actually means "very profitable".
But for most peple who never paid attention in school,  they just assume that "profitable" means something like.."lots of cash". It's ok. Don't worry about it. Not everyone is smart. I am 100% certain that you are good at something.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:07:57
That's ok. There are plenty of people who don't believe. I'll post some pictures this weekend or soon thereafter. I am curious to see the overall sentiment here. Also, you could just go through my post history and find the pictures I have posted in the past.
You have your way of doing things and I have mine. I suggest you just continue to assume I am lying. The odd thing about that is it that it won't affect me at all and you will be thinking about it for a while. You want it to be true...or would you prefer I am lying? Serious question.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:05:22
I say to go for it! Buy fom China. Negotiate well. They will definitely drop prices if you ask.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:55:27
Same with me and my brother.
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:00:01
I know.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:56:03
Maybe...but I REALLY doubt that is it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:34:17
Then you got your money's worth.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:09:39
I sell it for $300 MORE than I paid for it.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:34:19
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:04:23
Only possible conclusion.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:37:18
OK. Well try to link up. Apparently we are neighbors.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:11:16
You seem much better at posting.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:07:21
Your idea will work if btc keeps rising. Mine works because I leverage the value in the inventory as well.
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:34:28
You talk about expecting dickbutt. I wonder why that is...I am pretty sure I know what's up...I am guessing you like dicks and butts? But no, this will be nothing like that. It is just a video I took of my solar project. Even if it's not dicks and butts or whatever it is that you're into, I think you will see that it is real.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:42:17
My case is special. But I provided the numbers for those who don't wanna attach a mining operation to a farm. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:05:41
No.he claims he makes money on reselling AND mining.
How hard is it to get your mind around the 400 days of mining ? You people do understand that this is money also, right? The bitcoin are also counted in the profit.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:48:49
Being skeptical is good. Ever consider just going over the numbers yourself?
@_date: 2017-07-02 23:00:22
Just so you know...the entire content of almost ANYTHING living is water.
A lot of people don't really have much in the way of knowledge. Don't sweat it that you don't understand. There's a lot of stuff I still don't know...the difference is that I would never pretend to know it if I didnt. Most other people just pretend to know everything....like, you're pretty sure I that the lettuce I claim to be growing is not considered a low-water lettuce. It's ok...you just don't know. Maybe one day you will.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:03:56
Vertical farming is most efficient when done indoors with lighting. Lighting is cheapest in the desert with solar. Los Angeles and San Diego are the largest markets in the US for this type of produce. So this was basically the only place it was gonna work.
Yes, we use the miners for heat sometimes. In the Winter.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:41:03
Ok. I'll post it when people stop down voting me to keep me from the front page. If I keep getting down voted then I will post it on r/BitcoinMarkets.
But for now, I need the handful of people following this to understand what is going on in this sub.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:05:20
I know I am not imagining things. I know because I built a system that works and it was much easier than I thought. The negativity for such a project made no sense.
Something is wrong with this sub. I am gonna try to change that.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:23:39
Then it was a good one.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:03:14
I don't wanna meet that badly. No offense. You started as a dick. I am ok meeting if you have a real reason for meeting. Like...apologizing. or meeting me cuz you have an interest in what I am doing with regards to farming or mining.
I am not interested in going through a security screen to have lunch or dinner with you. If you are awesome then we'll be buds. But I have no reason to do all of that just cuz some guy on the internet was pretty sure I was lying.
Let's grab a beer at Piatti's or somewhere in La Jolla. But no security checks. Just two regular people trying to figure out what the other is up to...
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:05:39
I will. I need to make it to the front page of this sub. Otherwise no one will ever see it. I want EVERYONE to see it the first time.
I am being down voted into oblivion so that no one will see this posting. I will try agan tonight. I will get down voted again. But then...tomorrow morning...I will make it to the front page. Everyone will see the video. And then they will decide for themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:55:49
I owe bitcoin to no one. I give it back out of the kindness of my heart.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:41:40
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:11:35
Exactly. Just run the numbers. No one here has done that. it is SO fucking easy. I posted all the numbers. Just run them yourselves and see if it adds up.
Man...people in 2017 are lazy as fuck. And weird.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:06:19
Or just buy PACB and hold. See...everyone has a better investment idea!
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:35:48
The ones with my user name attached.
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:27:29
Fair enough. I already know that the people who care will appreciate it. The people like you will be pissed. But soon thereafter you will begin to dissect it and it will eventually devolve into, "You photo shopped the whole thing." Or..that isn't your project...you killed the guy who started the project and you're trying to take credit.
I don't do this for you. I do it for those who deserve it. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:40:16
Post to me in the thread and I will. For the record, man, you're being unnecessarily tough. You better not be a dick if we meet.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:59:11
Fair enough. Either way, if you're still around in a few days then you'll be able to see the pictures.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:44:58
@_date: 2017-07-02 03:32:05
Basically...you just wanted.
I don't give a fuck about your $50. Or your 0.2btc. if you wanna get my attention then make it in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or 50btc minimum.
I owe you nothing. I am here to post an update on my project...not to satiate you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:32:48
Ummm...you actually can easily buy it for that amount. Anyone can.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:16:02
You should.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:59:50
Alright... you do understand that I get thousands of posts and messages asking me for answers to questions, don't you?
Ok...here is your chance. What do you wanna know? I'll do my best to answer.
You do understand that I have been posing this project for a year now, don't you? And you do understand that 95% of the posts are people calling me a liar...even after I prove them wrong.
So...again...what do you wanna know?
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:59:01
Well...show me where they are wrong. Copy and paste the bad numbers. I told you I use at least 150 panels for a greenhouse. I am waiting to see your proof of where I am lying...
Go ahead...I am anxious to see it. You do know that when I show you the post where I detailed it you will just make some new excuse about how I am still wrong.  But...go ahead.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:13:14
I am profitable. Sorry if that is counter to what you want.
I also believe bitcoin will rise. I was very open about that.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:03:10
Ummm...there is a conspiracy against me. Also, your post to me is kinda telling me that you actually are interested.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:18:09
We'll see what the "enforcers" feel about this soon...just hang tight.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:43:37
Got it. My bad.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:13:11
Unless he isn't.
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:56:41
Come on...you're the worst.
But ok. Let's meet this week in Borrego. I'll be out there on Tuesday this week. And likely another day as well, but I don't know it yet. You're not very nice. I'll be polite to you but I am gonna dump you off to one of my employees to show you around.  I don't feel like putting up with you after we shake hands.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:12:07
That is a standard cost when you buy a container at a time. It can even be a 20' containers worth of panels.  
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:49:30
We are capped on what we can sell back.
I need to mine 24/7 or the model degrades. Therefore we need low cost batteries and more panels.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:35:35
I already posted pictures. You just assumed I didnt. Let's start there. Also, you say I am scamming someone. Hmm....I wonder who I am scamming?
You seem fake.
And yeah, I need millions for my mining operation (and also my farm). What is your point? I am pretty sure your point is that you cannot comprehend that amount of capital.
So, here is one person who is just calling me a liar and a con man. See what I mean? Where does he get this? Where am I asking people for money? He is likely just a fake account that is trying to get people to believe that mining is unprofitable. Or he is just some older guy who lives with his mom and is pissed that his dream of owning thousands of bitcoins will only ever be a dream.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:30:42
I doubt that.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:42:24
I recommend just letting it go and placing all your faith in Satoshi. He seems like he knew what he was doing.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:47:02
I can live with that.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:15:27
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:34:13
Reddit is ready. I don't think you understand.  This is going to happen.  I am going to get my answer. And you are going to get your video of my solar mining project.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:24:44
I make almost 0.004 with my R4's. They are all over clocked, however.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:07:08
Yes. I know.  I mine alts as well. I just don't really discuss it here cuz most people are weird about it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:25:21
Ok...I am gonna give you a Mulligan. Try to insult me again, but be funny this time. Take a while to really think about your insults.
Also, what is wrong with living in an apartment? Is that your definition of being a loser? Man...you are not very creative.
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:55:34
You didn't look hard enough.
Perjury? Ugh...ok. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:51:27
You're never gonna get it. I'll give you the heads up I can. Deal with it. Please stop messaging me. I'll message yout when I next know the day I am driving out. If it works, then great. Don't expect to spend more than a minute or two with me. I'll dump you off to Spencer and he can show you around.  He is nice.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:46:50
So...it turned out I wasn't lying, right? Those numbers were actually posted, weren't they?
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:13:39
I am not trying to change anyone's mind. I am trying to figure out what the bad players in this sub are up to.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:54:55
I don't know. I'll try to remember to ask my electrician this week. Don't be mad if I forget.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:35:59
Huh? Are you saying you want a picture?  No. The video is only way to prove it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:01:18
No. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:46:16
I don't have enough solar to run them.
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:42:53
From our well.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:36:32
They are tied to both. I generate income from both.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:21:39
Sure. I am happy to meet with a whole group of locals. It would be funny if that meeting was like one of my posts...
But yeah. Let's grab a beer!
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:09:15
Actually, it is kinda cool if you're into vertical farming. That is the most impressive part of what we do, in my opinion. The miners are just sitting on a shelf with a blower connected near them.
Of course I am biased cuz it is my baby.
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:15:59
Sorry bro. You are just wrong. I did detail those numbers. You just didn't look hard enough. That is not my fault. It is technically your fault.
I wonder if you are the type of person who would apologize if they insulted someone then found out they were the one who had made the mistake....
Look up my original post that was down voted this weekend. I genuinely do detail the numbers for the greenhouses. You just didn't read the entire thing. I don't know what else to say. I suppose I could just link you to it...but you seem like such a dick that I am gonna make you decide if you wanna spend 2 minutes with a search or if you just wanna keep being a dick. It is I the original post, if you wanna search for it.
Either way, the numbers are in my post history. For real.
You'll see the solar array today when I post it. I can't wait to hear how you criticize it after you see it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:28:11
I got into it by posting some controversial things on this sub. A few people here felt I was lying and we set up a bet. I won the bet. I won a thousand bitcoin (twice) and the rest is history.
For you,  you'll need a micro loan from the USDA. They will loan up to $30k for a well written proposal for a vertical farm. That is my best suggestion to you. Unless you're unbelievably clever like me, it will be difficult for you to acquire the money on Reddit. Plus, you will need thousands of btc to cover your bets.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:40:03
Oh...yeah. I don't account for that. I should.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:57:01
We cool with mini splits. And we grow in greenhouses because this is the cleanest way to grow, pesticide free.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:48:17
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:23:57
I just want the handful of people who are following this project to understand the nature of this subreddit.
I know this is not the most interesting thing going on in the world of bitcoin. It is just a very simple mining operation. But the level of effort that has been expended on making people believe that this is impossible is inordinately high for the overall project I am working on.
For those who are interested, I have taken videos of my setup. I am expecting this post to be deleted soon. I will just post my videos in r/BitcoinMarkets if they keep deleting my posts. There is a chance that that sub also deletes them. If that is is the case, just PM me and I will give you the link to the video.
I just uploaded it to YouTube, for those who are interested. But before I post the link publicly, I am curious to see what responses (if any) this post receives. My guess is it will mostly be insults and accusations. That seems to be the only thing the FAKE POSTERS can come up with. I wish they had been more clever. I always enjoy a challenge. This was not a challenge.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:16:56
That's cuz you don't get it. Don't sweat it. You want money. I prefer to make money doing big things. You prefer little things. But we are both capitalists.
No one will offer you money, in my opinion. Good luck, though. And I appreciate your offer to do it...but I resent your request for a donation from me.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:14:57
Almost 100 btc. I haven't sold yet.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:04:29
I want you to address me that way, going forward.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:51:26
I bet some people on Reddit that I can do this. They didn't believe me. They bet me I was lying. I wasn't lying. They lost the bet. I took their money and bought a yacht. Then I used the rest to finish testing my farm/bitcoin mining idea. It's all in my post history over the years.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:18:55
So? What are you going to do about it? Just alert me? Ok. Duly alerted. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:42:50
Your analogy is terrible.
And the other stuff you wrote isn't even true. Also, you made up the part about me refusing to give you proof. My numbers do add up. I know this cuz I pay the bills. You are just guessing.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:49:42
Wanna bet? I'll make that bet public as well.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:09:50
Cuz you are leaving money on the table.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:07:37
You are welcome. I feel that my humour is wasted here. But then...you get it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:58:41
I buy 1,000 but will only run a fraction of those at a time because I do not have the solar capacity for that many miners. The rest are an inventory.
Also, I am not "scared". There is little for me to fear in the year 2017.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:46:42
How do you know, for sure?
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:24:32
They paid us 1100 bitcoins. Wanna bet? You pay for escrow. I provide 100 to 1 odds. I do this all the time with people here. If you don't believe me then look up my post history. I always win. So...yeah. 100 to 1 odds. I will get a free bitcoin and some more notoriety. You will just have to change your user name out of embarrassment and then move on.
Your user name means "unemployed" by the way. Nice name.
Is anyone here (other than the person I am gonna PM) even kinda interested in my original idea? Or...if not, is anyone else here interested in getting in on "unemployed's" bet?
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:29:19
I posts them already.
Yes, I have 83 or more btc.
I gave numbers already.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:28:22
I didn't see that. When and where are we meeting? I have a thing at 1 today. Probably done at 3.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:00:00
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:07:59
I actually have a strong desire to NOT be believed. It would be kinda nice if some of the newly rich bitcoin idiots would come out of the woodwork and bet me that I am making all this up.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:48:56
Idk yet. What do you think? I am curious to switch to a new supplier...that would be nice.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:48:48
Not now. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:34:08
Cuz it is important to him.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:43:27
Well, I am doing my part.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:59:29
I will.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:20:43
So, your math is wrong. My greenhouses cost me $90k. I spend $6,800 for the infrastructure for each miner. So you only need to focus on the $6,800. I pay for the entire rig in just over a year. Then I own the rig AND the new miner. Now I can continue mining for free. This is just a solution to help bootstrap the growth of a mining operation. You either get it or you don't.

Then I am your neighbor. Wanna bury the hatchet and grab a beer at Piatti's this weekend? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:40:25
That is why I think the miners want this to never be discussed. I am actually surprised my post is still up. I am pretty sure the miners don't want people to know that mining is easily profitable with this model (the model they use).
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:03:13
I mean no disrespect, but you are wrong.
It is very simple. Look at the number of posts and the amount of time these posts occurred. You will see that as soon as I posted, the negative votes flooded in. It was coordinated. There are people just waiting for me to post so they can down vote me. I know that sounds like I am crazy. But it is true.
If I post the video link now, only a few people will see it. This posting is about to disappear from down votes now.
I want to post the video to as many people as possible. Posting it now will just cause it to disappear.  I need one of my posts to make it to the front page. When it does, I will post the video link. My post will them be deleted or go parabolic.
So...even though the odds of you believing everything I wrote being true are zero..lit is still the case. And I PROMISE with my guarantee that if I don't post it by tomorrow then you can reference this post as often as you want. I will post it...on my reputation. You just have to wait a bit and let me get onto the front page. Then all will become apparent. In the mapeantime, I am totally fine with everyone hating me. For the record,  if you are irritated with me then it is likely that you are a FAKE POSTER or you are easily influenced by the people who are trying to influence this.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:21:10
Just saying...see how I am down voted? The level of interest in most of my other posts regarding this project go to the very top. All of those people were waiting for the proof. I can deliver the proof within a few minutes. Now, all of a sudden, no one cares. This is what I was trying to explain to everyone. This sub is not for real. I am not crazy. This is not a conspiracy theory. There are a handful of people who are paranoid beyond belief of what I can show you. And they will keep this post away from most of your eyes. And if it starts to go parabolic it will be deleted.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:43:28
I am not afraid of that. No one here has enough money to do that.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:50:18
I don't work there. That is a rich kid school.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:01:48
Any cost? No.

We are east. We cool with mini split AC's. We have internet. So there is no problem.
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:05:51
I will.

Yes, we are shooting for a very high level of sterilization. We cannot use ANY pesticides so this is our solution. And yes the plants are HIGHLY susceptible to attack in the desert.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:12:15
No problem. I hope it was worthwhile for you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:05:13
We don't have miners to sell but I am always available here for anyone to discuss or ask me questions.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:23:25
That's just your opinion. I feel you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:35:32
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:53:46
I already have a business that has excess solar. For me, this model makes exceptional sense. But I believe it works for anyone in a high sun area.
Your idea is also good. You should try it out. Let me know how it works if you do try it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:12:50
 I type fake stuff sometimes. I am human. I lie. But I am not lying this time.

I am on campus nearly everyday. Give me a few hours heads up pretty much any day. I can meet there or in La Jolla for a beer or something.
Play basketball? I am at Rimac almost everyday. I play at least 3 hours per day. Almost every day.
@_date: 2017-07-04 05:14:53
So...for the four or five people who are following this, this is what I am talking about. See how I am only going to get insults trying to discourage others from simply politely asking me for the video link?
And see how they down voted me to invisibility? There is no way that should happen with the number of people who were waiting for this video proof.
Just think about it. All of my posts go to the top. Because they are controversial and also filled with information that people who view posts here are interested in. I receive SO many PM's from people who want to meet me...wanna fight me...want me to give them btc...but mostly they wanna NOT have a record of themselves asking me a question, they only wanna talk to me privately.
I am not saying I get thousands. But I do get hundreds of PM's every time I post. I don't know how many hundreds of private messages most people get when they make one post but I am guessing they don't get anywhere near as many as I do. But maybe I a wrong, I am not an expert on Reddit.
Remember just the other day when my post went to the top and some guy even parodied it..and that went to the top? Well, here is the follow up ALL those people were asking for.
Where are those people now?
I am not trying to be weird. I am just trying to explain that there is a ccordinated effort by some people to keep information away from the community. You don't have to believe it. It won't effect you either way, most likely.  Very few real people are in this sub. But still..it is for real. And I have a few more things I need to know. I am going to make a few more posts between today and tomorrow. For the handful of you following this, when they kick me out, I will go to r/BitcoinMarkets. They will likely kick me out there as well but I am hoping to be able to get the link to my video up to everyone for at least a couple hours. I am hoping that some of you will keep posting it so that it makes it out to the people who would benefit from at least knowing it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:55:06
This is my basic premise. This sub is full of FAKE POSTERS. A true bitcoiner would be ALL over my mining operation. They would be dying to find out how it could be done. They would be excited but skeptical.
If I count you then I am guessing about 4 or 5 people asked me to detail further. Everyone else either insulted me or called me a liar.
Something really is fishy here.
I think that a bunch of the posts here are FAKE. Mine could even be fake, statistically.
To answer your questions, I still do hydroponic farming. And aquaponic. Also aeroponic.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:34:47
You responded to me as well. Does the same rule hold true for you as well?
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:08:19
So many reasons...but mostly cuz I control the lights my way and I need a clean environment.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:35:45
Sounds fair.
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:01:34
True. There is a chance I am making it all up. Seems totally weird to be like that, though. It would mean I have a critical character flaw.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:26:00
Ok. Take him then. See...we all win!
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:14:32
No...not that State, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:36:18
What is so rotten with it?
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:10:26
Your post summarizes it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:21:36
Yes. Calculated in my energy costs. I assume you already have an ac. But an ac that is $650 will cool 4 miners. From China, of course.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:55:36
I wanted to share.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:44:00
That's not funny anymore.  Not since the 80's.
Try to be funnier. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:51:42
Exactly. But still... this guy's post was hilarious!
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:55:42
Actually, you didn't do the math on your CPU miner joke.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:01:51
I think it is around 10 with over clocking but you can look it up.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:22:20
But it was unexpected money which funded this project. I am sorry that you feel you would have made better use of my money. If I had not invested the money in this project then you would not have been able to post your criticism...
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:53:45
I am not spamming. I really do have the video. I'm just waiting for people to actually ask me to post it. I need this sub to truly understand what is going on.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:25:00
Just Google: solar farm bitcoin Reddit. You'll find them all.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:22:33
I have pictures. I have posted them before. You can look them up. Just Google "bitcoin desert farm reddit" and you will find them.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:56:38
Ok. What about the mining part though? How would you classify that?
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:57:21
That's a first...thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:30:25
I can't sell it back to the grid. SDG&amp;E will not allow us to sell more than we use. This is the overall best solution that I could devise.
I already cool my greenhouses. I just piggy-back on this existing cooling system.
My greenhouses are also off grid. They use about 10 times more power than a miner.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:30:23
I just attained profitability in June. Hence, my post to discuss the numbers.
@_date: 2017-07-03 01:03:58
You'll see why within a few days. Just hang tight.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:41:09
After a year, you have a free, brand new miner and a free solar system with batteries. Now you can continue this model of reselling your miner, while also mining. All for free. And it'll last 20 years for the solar and 6 more years for the batteries.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:05:50
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:51:28
They have to stay around $2,000. But yeah...profits depend on that. But like I said, we're all believers, right!!??
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:09:36
Makes sense. I was pretty generous with my info. Only a dick would do that.
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:42:47
It's important. I promise I will make it clear.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:52:07
I don't know if I wanna start uploading spreadsheets of data here. But your math is pretty close. There are a few things you are not considering: (1) profit from the resell of the miners over those 420 days. (2) The likely rise in btc price. (3) You have paid for the solar system and can now mine for free for 20 years.
For some reason, people keep forgetting those three important things.
Thanks for the support! And I will keep up the posts on my updates, as I always do.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:32:36
What about the organic veggies I am growing?
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:05:03
That's what we pay when we buy in volume.and yeah..they are not the best. But they work.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:49:49
We will see!
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:29:59
But you have JUST enough time for this one last dig.

@_date: 2017-07-02 21:04:44
Clearly. I mean...sheesh...someone that won't arrange his hectic schedule around a stranger...so that said stranger can have verification that I am not lying. What a jerk I am. I mean...you are SO deserving of my time.
I don't give a fuck if you don't believe me. Join the fucking club. No one here believes me.
You claim you could have been an "advocate". LOL...a fucking "advocate"? You would ruin everything I am trying to do here.
The "evdence"  that you so crave is gonna arrive. I already told you that. Just sit back and wait for it. Then you can jump in like everyone else and bitch at me for having taken all this time just to photo shop it all.
As weird as this sounds,  you're still invited this week. Deal with the schedule I have.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:36:18
I don't like your idea. Mine is better.
My favorite was where you talked about supporting me at one point, then realized that I am a liar. So, if I am telling the truth...what then? You left yourself no way out...you went all-in on me being a liar.
I cam across as distrustful? Umm...did you read my original post? I laid out all the numbers for everyone as a favor. You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:14:33
I thought that was obvious...
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:47:52
I am being honest. I am actually being oddly overly honest.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:35:43
$1250-ish and we sell for $1500-ish. Sometimes much more.
We pay off the infrastructure in a year. Now we own a small power plant.

Every business I have, I try to sell to the end of the supply chain directly. Maximizing profits is what I am all about.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:04:25
Boring enough to read it all and post to me? Sounds pretty boring...
Sorry for boring you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:46:02
Of course I ran that. The numbers didn't add up, but I went in anyhow cuz the capital investment from me was essentially zero. I told everyone over the course of the year that it was crazy and highly speculative. It also turned out to have worked.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:03:51
There are SO many awesome people at UCSD!
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:23:44
Or what?
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:04:47
Sure. Contact me next week and we'll arrange it. Please understand that this is a very small operation so if you are expecting something massive and amazing then this is not it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:28:40
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:38:54
Any time!
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:40:25
I notice it locally.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:15:25
Dang. I don't have those pics. But ok. I will upload them.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:32:08
And a smart investment.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:29:13
Yeah. Better!
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:43:09
Yeah. San Diego is such a poorly run city. In fact, the whole State is run by idiots.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:21:18
Can you show me where my math is off? I ask because it is working in real life.
I designed the greenhouse to take as little space as possible. We can angle the panels. But now we are just building an array nearby and no longer placing the panels on the roofs and sides.
Lastly, remember that I am in the desert so get the most sun. Did you include this coefficient in your calculations?
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:23:07
He told me he mis-typed. Let it go. How come you don't bitch at him for saying he is gonna hit me?
Anyhow, he and I worked it out. If you wanna delete this post, feel free. I am burned out on answering people anyhow. I learned what I came here for.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:56:47
Right. Until I post..then my credibility will incease in spades. You just don't understand human nature. It's ok. I do. I'll take care of it for you. You will appreciate what I am doing, I believe.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:56:13
People come out all the time.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:50:01
I don't buy PSU's. I plug them in directly to DC. This is more efficient when using solar. No one asked so I never offered that info.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:52:07
"Misleading" to you. Not to me.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:10:30
Yes.i am in a unique position. But my numbers are not based on my existing infrastructure.
I am just wondering why most people say this is impossible? Like how they say that mining at home is stupid. I also do it at $0.43 per kwh at home. I am breaking even at that rate.

I prefer aquaponics now as an overall solution. But I like the results from aeroponic. We need a good marriage between the two but it is hard to pull off because the misting nozzles get clogged with fish shit.
We control the environment so we can basically use any method.

eBay with no store.
You don't understand bitcoin mining.
The photos of the greenhouse are in my history.
The rest of the info is on my posts of this project. Sorry...you gotta look it up.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:54:41
That is a good point. I already own the land. And yes I accounted for the cooling costs (but not the actual system). The AC system for just the miners is $650.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:53:18
I do both.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:38:05
Glad to have contributed!
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:10:12
The miners sell at a premium on the resell market. I suggest purchasing more than you need and reselling them, while using them to supplement the earnings.
If you keep doing this then you will profit from resell and you will also stay current with the miners.
Yes. 100 of the next S9's. I have enough solar for my greenhouses and the 25 miners. I am about to begin a multi megawatt array to support my growth.
I like my style too!
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:33:28
It won't haunt me.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:07:17
I am not worried at all.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:26:16
What have you done with regards to bitcoin? I have actually done stuff and put real effort into making use of it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:11:07
I feel like I could be less efficient and still be profitable.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:03:00
I care about the content of my posts. Not the upvotes.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:02:56
I like your version. I do the exact same as well.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:59:57
I know. But I thought the info would be appreciated. I guess I was wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:46:14
I will post some. Probably this weekend. You do understand that it is just a solar array with 40' containers turned into greenhouses, with a shelf of miners inside, don't you?
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:15:13
I am switching to ICF construction on the next generation of the farm. It is a pain to bury underground. But it is a great idea. Just..the money you have to pay for making it water tight is a lot. But...yes...you get it.
O-Chem is such a waste for pre-med, usually. Just like Calculus. But I guess it does make me feel a little better that the guy opening me up is smart enough to pay attention and at least remember all the "rules" you teach them in Organic Chemistry.
I am gonna place the solar array above as well.
Thanks for the post!
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:41:41
Sounds good. Make a separate post on this sub and let everyone know you want to make a public bet that I am lying.
I will take pictures and video of my farm with the miners. Once this is done, we will need an escrow agent in charge of the distribution. We can also have the agent come to the farm and document it themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:51:16
I don't need drugs to be going on like this. I just have one day to get the answer I need so I kinda have to be diligent. Hopefully you won't find it too annoying. My recommendation to you is to ignore me til tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:02:02
Thank you.  I am an open book. I do not delete or edit. Anymore...ever.
Anyone can figure me out by reading my post history. It is all right there.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:57:35
That's your take on it.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:12:08
Seems kinda old fashioned....
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:01:04
I am profitable. I paid off my capital investment in equipment. Now I mine for free. I made my first net profit in June.

No. I don't donate. I take.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:00:56
I don't need to convince anyone. I already know whether I am lying or not.
I apologize if I came across as rude. But you just asked me for my address on the Internet and acted as if I needed you to prove something. I don't.  But I am sorry for acting rude. And I will provide pictures.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:39:42
It does. You just didn't read the correct post. Read the previous post.

I don't smoke pot unless my buddy from Florida comes to San Diego and makes me when we go fishing.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:40:09
I show you the contract and the transfer. In fact I post it and prove it right here, on this sub. The 3 guys who also were in on it will also confirm. Oh...and the escrow service and lawyer you hire will confirm the rest...which we will also post here. I will put an extra 20 bitcoins into the escrow service to pay you for the legal fees if you win.
Simple. I feel that you're starting to feel interested. Alright...let's see if we can get this bet going!
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:38:05
You're funny.

Your analogy was so fucking stupid.
I don't know the answer to the grounding question you asked. That is for sure.  I didn't build or design the solar either.  I paid for it, though.
Here is something that you could consider...you claimed that you can size anyone up via your military background and whatnot. Now...how are you gonna handle it when I post pics of my setup?
Also, you're kinda stupid. And seriously...read your analogy again. It is comically stupid.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:28:23
I accounted for cooling but not the ac itself. The ac costs $650 from China.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:18:25
Or what?
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:42:05
Hmmm...I wanna test it. What would you suggest? 
Also...thanks for sharing! And the detail...much appreciated!!

"Pretending". That is too funny. Kinda like I am a liar, right? I detailed it in the original post. Sorry that you didn't read it all or that you forgot about that part.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:04:04
This sub is so strange.  And awesome, I do have to admit that as well.
How can people read my posts and then constantly claim that I am trying to steal their money or rip them off?
I mean...I get it that mostly millenials use Reddit. But are they truly that stupid? Yes...I know they are. But THAT stupid?  It just can't be. No one is that stupid. Right...?
I know this sounds crazy and it probably is...but is there ANY chance that miners are controlling this sub? Is there ANY chance that they are trying to get the word out, through any means they have, that people shouldn't mine? I know that sounds crazy and maybe it is crazy. But I think back to all the times I have posted here about mining and I am blasted by peple who just make stuff up about how mining is a losing business.
If it TRULY is a losing business then how come there are so many miners that are running right now? AND how is the network still growing so quickly if EVERYONE is losing money? I feel that this sub is not clean.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:53:50

I really doubt you think it is cute. Cuz here's the thing: if I am telling the truth then your entire premise falls apart. It is no longer "cute". 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:22:35
I know. But I was hoping.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:21:57
You actually misunderstood me also. Listen: I am not trying to be a dick. I am trying to discuss the mining operation. But no one wants to do that. They just wanna talk about how they hate the way I write.
@_date: 2017-07-04 03:12:54
Are you 100% certain...?
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:19:30

I will post them. Feel free to look up my precious pictures in previous posts. I have detailed this project since the beginning on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:43:24
Oh....sorry. It really looked like you wanted to punch me.
Well, the offer still stands except now we won't fight!
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:56:59
See what I mean?  If I post that I am mining off solar, I am attacked as a liar.
If I post that I will prove it...no one cares. No one is really here.
See what I mean about this sub? It is not real.
When I post pictures, those posts are down voted into oblivion. When I start to talk about it, I am blasted as a liar.
Just....the handful of real people here should understand the actual nature of this sub. It is very likely that many opinions you have all formed about the current state of bitcoin is influenced by a small group of people who are trying to control the narrative.
You'll see what I mean. In the meantime, watch what happens to this post where I claim I am about to show proof.

I resell the miners to profit a bit and also to stay current on the miners.
I mostly grow lettuce now. But we are also growing peppers, tomatoes, strawberries and micro greens. We will expand to other produce as we bring new greenhouses online.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:19:56
Yes. Exactly.
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:36:26
People can bet me any amount. But I am reluctant to take money from those who don't have much. Like most people here, you also don't understand me. That is ok. I am just sorry that you were unable to see what I am up to.
For the record, the solar/battery solution I proposed ONLY works if buy from China.
The yacht guys were idiots.
Good luck with your mining!
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:03:41
And not to mention the solar I paid for with my btc earnings.
I guess no one should mine.

Ok. When and where do you wanna meet?
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:09:08
Except his first posts on Reddit warning people about Mt Gox. Other than those posts and his year long posts on Reddit detailing his solar/farming/mining project from it's inception to it's first month of profitability, his posts are just a waste of everyone's time.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:53:47
I am not out there. I won't be there til Monday or Tuesday. This is a tiny side project for me.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:31:24
Do you think there is ANY chance that he made his posts to be generous and begin a discussion? Only to be shocked and saddened by the response he received?
The funniest thing that always happens when I post and mostly receive insults is that I make a lot of money. Then I post the answers everyone wanted and I just receive more insults.
So, I cannot win. But...oddly I still win... your bitcoin.
Anyhow, I will post the pics of the solar array. And the greenhouse/miner setup. A few people will thank me for it. 99% of you will begin anew with the insults, accusations, and finally the posts about how I just photo-shopped the whole thing.
You guys are lucky I still post it. Very few here deserve what I provide for free.
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:01:20
I don't have them on me. I want to wait to upload them. I wanted people to discuss this. I also feel slighted and disappointed by this sub. But I will upload them. Of course, then people will say it is photo shopped just like my last posts of my greenhouse that no one believed in.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:07:28
You're welcome.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:37:28
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:46:18
I'll post the pictures. I just don't feel like it right now because I am still learning a lot about this sub.
@_date: 2017-07-01 07:29:25
I doesn't matter to me. That is just your incorrect assumption.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:41:27
I feel, with bitcoin, it will never be too late.
@_date: 2017-07-03 05:11:36
Yes. I did. I will take pictures tomorrow for everyone. I have three different arrays. Two are near Blythe, CA and one is in Borrego.
You can critique it when I post it tomorrow.

I will do something similar to that...because you're so nice and polite.
Gimme a few days.
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:34:01
Exactly. These people are FAKE POSTERS. They are trying to get people to believe that mining in not profitable. When anyone tries to discuss it these accounts are brought out and the idea is dismissed as stupid.
These are mostly fake accounts that are created over months to give an air of legitimacy.
Of course I am not scamming anyone. I posted this whole project over the course of a year. What kind of stupid long con is that? Also...I never ask for money so why does everyone think I am scamming them?
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:28:52
You'll see. Just have the slightest amount of faith in me for a tiny little bit more. I am genuinely trying to help people out. I am genuinely going to post this. I genuinely posted all of my costs and how anyone can set it up. I am not lying in any way.
Do you happen to notice how many people have asked me to post the video?
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:23:50
Big deal. A lot of shit about me is probably "fishy" to you. I have very little desire to be believed by non-believers. I just want to be able to communicate important things to the bitcoin community without being censored.  And without the moderators possibly being complicit in telling people FAKE FACTS.
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:37:09
You didn't see my posts this evening?
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:54:47
It is all there. And you will have to "sift" though my post history to see it. By reading my post history, you will also learn a lot.
My numbers for the bitcoin mining are separate from my farm. You just were unable to understand that.
I did buy a yacht. It is old. I am about to restore it and turn it electric. I will also post that project in Reddit.
I actually am "unbelievably clever".

@_date: 2017-07-03 01:13:17
I'm not. I am stringing you along. It will make sense to you within a few days. In the meantime, just keep disliking me a bunch. Afterwards, we'll reassess your opinion of me. Sound fair? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:31:12
I paid for my entire solar infrastructure for mining AND the miners within a year. Now I have free miners, a resell channel to profit on them, and a free solar infrastructure. Now I mine for free. That is the ROI I have made now.

Then let's meet if you wanna. I live near you in La Jolla.
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:31:30
Well, I know it can't be me. I know this because my miners are running and I am making money.
I rarely post here but when I do I try to really share as much as possible. I am constantly bitched at and called a liar or con man. It is just so weird because....well...I never asked anyone for money. In fact, I always tell people to not do what I am doing because it seems so speculative. But then I do it myself. And it works.
I am pretty sure that this sub is run by miners. I am pretty sure that they are very selective in what they try to get rid of. And one thing they try to make sound impossible is mining. 
Anyhow, I mine at home at $0.43 per kwh. I am breaking even. If no one believes me then I will show them my data. I have an R4 and an S9 in my house. I make .011 btc on average with these 2 machines (over clocked a bit). I pay $700 per month in electricity for them. That is the truth. 100%. My miners in the desert make a VERY good profit.
Mining is profitable Someone here is trying to keep this info from getting out. Sounds weird. Probably is weird. But I am pretty sure it is true. I will try another posting about mining and we will see what happens. I am pretty sure it gets downvoted to obscurity. And along the way, people will jump in and try to make me out to be some kind of con man that is trying go take everyone's bitcoin.
What a shame. I wish we had a place to really communicate.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:17:31
Cheap land is all over the US. My land is actually kinda costly, in my opinion. $1000 per acre for fallowed land. $6000per acre for farm land.
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:32:06
Dang. Thank you. But I am just a regularly interesting guy in real life. This is interesting to you,  I am guessing, cuz you are probably kinda like me. You're into new ideas that just make sense, right? And you like the idea of being ahead of the curve, I am assuming?
So...it is not that I am super interesting. It is that we would probably get along spectacularly in real life!
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:54:18
I'm sorry but you truly don't understand. It's ok. You will still get your video. So if you are interested in seeing...and you are interested,  let's be honest, then just hang tight and I guarantee you that you will see it. I am not saying you will be blown away...but if you have a keen attention to detail...I assure you,  you will see the few things that are quite interesting.

I don't feel paranoid. I am not playing games. I just posted some info and it was down voted until it disappeared. I felt it was too important to have been removed.
I don't need an upvote. I just want to see what the reaction is to my posting about this sub being fishy with regards to mining.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:24:17
Yeah...to be honest..I don't know much either. And when I step back...I see that I also mouth off on stuff I really don't fully understand. We're all the same, I have realized.
Just...I am funnier than most.
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:35:28
Well, let me make it simple: I will never ask for money here.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:51:33
I am not a likeable person. It is kinda like that in real life too.
But my intentions are good. And my posts are for the benefit of the community. I know, for a fact, that some people appreciate them.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:04:37
Haha. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:01:18
It already is.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:20:23
Just email them with an amount you want to buy and ask them if they will offer a discout for that amount. Then pay. The wait a couple months. The next ones are shipping in a couple months.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:25:34
Where are you located? If I may ask?
And, here is what we are planning to do...since you have provided so much info. We are building at least 300 new greenhouses by the end of this year. If it actually worked out as my engineer and grad students claim...then we would, ideally, place at a least one miner in each of these greenhouses. That is not a huge operation. I know. But the growth rate of our farm, at least right now, is insane. Anything I can tack onto this farm that generates profit is what I am interested in.
So, since I do not fully understand the setup we are using to run these miners...can you explain what would be required for us to test the S5? Will it run directly off our DC system? Will we need to convert to AC for that miner?
Ever in San Diego? Can I gift you some produce?
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:11:07
Almost a million watts total. Maybe 100k available during the day for mining. Maybe...40k available at night, if we use the batteries. But we use less air conditioning at night.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:40:00
Are you call me pathetic?
Either way, I am glad you appreciate me!
@_date: 2017-07-04 04:01:02
I mean...pretty much everyone here hates me. Right? And pretty much everyone is convinced that I'm lying, right? Well, if I don't post these videos then I would recommend that if I ever post here again everybody call me out and point to where I did not do what I said I would. I would imagine that this would be the most effective way to have me stop posting here.
So let's see if enough people actually ask me to post. My guess is that very few people even see this post.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:08:35
My bad.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:38:13
I am gonna swipe your $50. But only because you are a dick. I am gonna upload the pictures of my mining setup. Everyone will claim it was anticlimactic. Then I will collect the money that you idiots are gonna give me.
Don't forget to give me that $50 when I post my pictures of my greenhouse/miner setup. Let's not waste time with the moderators here. I'll just trust you to do what you said.
Anyhow, I'll take pics of the solar, greenhouse and miners set up in the greenhouse. Don't forget to send the $50 when I post it.

The greenhouse allows me to completely control the enviroment. It allows me to use no pesticides.  And it allows me to go vertical.

This is one of the few times that someone asked a serious question in this post. OK, so we use the LED lights because they are energy efficient. They are less efficient than direct sun. You know this cuz of your BS in Chem. We then alter, with our software and control system, the wavelength of the light for the plants, depending on where they are in their growth cycle. We also send signals (via wavelength changes) to the plants to induce certain events (which are usually geared towards higher yields).
We grow in the container cuz it has to be a clean room. We do not use ANY pesticides so we must focus on a perfectly clean growing environment.
Also, a glass greenhouse in the Summer, in the desert is impossible to cool. It will be 150F inside. Everything, including our employees, will die.
The water from our well is 73F. This is critical for us. It is unique for a desert to have so much cool water.
How you described yourself is what we are looking for in employees. I am inundated with resumes from UCSD students but I will take your's seriously if you want to send it. We are hiring.

When someone writes something like what I wrote, and I am interested, then I do my own homework. Or I ask polite questions. I do not start with insults and accusations. It is just the right way to do things.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:14:04
Maybe. Are you exceptional at timing the market and trading? I like my idea better.
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:15:53
What a great question. I answered it in my original post which was down voted. 
Basically, you must resell and replace the miners every 8-12 weeks. This allows you to use the miner for a while, then sell it for a profit. The bitcoin you earn from mining is used to pay off the solar system costs. It is all based on bitcoin inflating, of course. But we all believe that will happen so I feel that I don't often have to say that.
This way, you have a new miner and the solar system is paid for. Now you can continue mining for free with a current miner cuz your panels will last 20 years, your batteries will last at least 6 years and your miner is new.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:01:28

I already knew you were not going to bet. The bets I propose are not for you or people like you. The bets are for the idiots. And the bets are to reallocate wealth towards a better cause.
Regarding your advice: yes, you're kinda right about your ideas of what I should do. Only, you don't understand my intentions so your advice is actually not the one I need. I do, however, appreciate it and I am saddened you were unable to see what I am doing.
As for the "proof" everyone is so anxious for me to post, if you had read my ENTIRE post history you would have seen that I do post the proof. As for telling people my suppliers in China...yeah... sometimes I don't answer those questions because I want people to do the work themselves and I don't want everyone here going to one supplier over there. Also, the suppliers I have found are not perfect. If I recommend one and they screw you over (like I have been screwed over from many suppliers) then who do you think will be to blame?
I am going to post my pictures of the solar and greenhouse/miner setup. I promise you that it will be up within a small number of days. I ALWAYS show the proof I need, here, to win the bets that people make with me.
I am trying to do a few things: (1) fund my farm through bitcoin (2) test these crazy ideas and make them publicly available if they work (3) show this community that it is over-run with a group that is up to something that isn't good (4) profit from my investment.
If you read ALL my posts, from beginning to end, the entire story is right there.i I know it is a lot of work. I know I am a boring read. I do not recommended that you waste an hour or two reading my smattering of posts...but if you did then you would get it.
Also, I really did start my posts about this project about a year ago. You can view the very first one and see how open I have been. Once the insults and accusations started flying, I realized something was wrong and I went after the source. You may not like my method, but I assure you that my intentions are in the right place.
For the record, here is what I am going to post in a few days: some pics of the solar array, my greenhouse/miner setup and the plants growing inside. I am telling you now that no one will be impressed with it. They will all bitch that it is just a container with lights and a shelf with some miners sitting on it. I will show everyone and I will still be called a scam artist.
I spent a LOT of time and money on this project. I give most of the info away for free that I worked very hard to gather. I am actually DOING something with bitcoin.What are you doing?
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:39:03
We'll see...
@_date: 2016-07-31 18:31:28
I don't know. I spend a lot of time there. They're all lazy as fuck. The entire economy is built on tourism from people coming in on boats for half a day.
The government is corrupt. And they borrow like crazy. They don't invest in training or education beyond high school. No one wants to work or learn. But the island is beautiful and it's nearly impossible to own a gun there (so the island can't revolt against the 1%).
I'm only there cuz they sell citizenship. And it's a tax haven. And it's beautiful. I mostly stay on the southeastern part of the island. This is where the non-natives are. It is the nicest part of the island. The rest of the island (except for one neighborhood about 45 minutes northwest) is gross as shit. And the people are the reason it is gross as shit. They just throw their garbage in the streets and their lawns.
Or...maybe it's your "seeking to maximize autonomy" thing. I don't know.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:42:01
Thanks. But, to be honest, we have not done an incredible amount of research on solar mining. We went thorough the numbers. They seemed to make sense. And now we're about to pull the trigger on a small scale test.
I guess...wish us luck?
@_date: 2016-07-11 01:49:45
Yes. The S9 is what we are buying. But I would have tested the S5 if someone could confirm that it was worth it.
Anyhow, back to the power supply. How do you sell these power supplies? You're in Nicaragua.
May I ask how: how cheap is it to live there? Do you really enjoy it? Sounds like you have been there a while..I assume so. I ask because I am considering leaving the US in the next few years. Mildly considering it. Not Central America, however. 
Thanks again for your your generosity in sharing the info!
@_date: 2016-07-10 03:40:20
Smart people will likely come to bitcoin. I agree with that. Labor costs in China..yes..that is an issue. But the labor costs there have been rising very quickly in the last 5 years. And I do expect them to reach parity with the US in the next 10 years (maybe sooner...if we crash hard).
It will always come down to innovation, in my opinion. Do we have enough people who actually can innovate here? For now...yes. What if there is a quick and rapid rebalancing of power after the impending collapse of our economy?  Will China take over? Will the Chinese who study and ultimately move here still remain here? Or will they go back to China because of big paychecks and less regulation? 
I am opening a fertility clinic, for example. I cannot open my clinic in the US because of regulations. I want to provide very modern genetic analysis to my patients. But the US government will not allow me to share this information. So...we are opening right across the border from San Diego, in Tijuana. Crazy, right? We are as high tech and modern as you can get. We have the world's best genetic scientists and they cannot share their abilities here. Cuz of religion and regulation. China will be very accommodating in this regard. I would set up there right now, if it made sense.
Can we build better Asics? Idk. Maybe. Samsung is just as good as Intel right now on processor tech. And ARM, for that matter.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:28:09
Yes. Sometimes much more. Look up the pricing on eBay.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:00:06
We charge our battery array as well though. So...I have to figure out if using the batteries at night for mining is worth it. We run our farm (lights, pumps,  air conditioning) at night on these batteries. Maybe allocating the excess battery backup would be worth it too. Maybe...I just don't know.

From Bitmain. I order as soon as they begin taking orders. This is what all the miners do. They jostle for position in line. Then they all do what I do...mine and resell.
They just don't want anyone to know this, for some reason. I find it weird. I want more people mining. I feel that this will only help bitcoin grow in adoption and value.

@_date: 2017-07-01 01:55:16
Yes. I also do not see how I am constantly labeled a scam artist. But...people are weird nowadays.
I still believe it is controlled by miners. You do understand that if they were covertly doing this then it wouldn't be like how you are describing.  They would likely have numerous accoun's they can draw from to begin to shape a story.
Again...just my theory. Cuz the hatred against me in this sub is fucking stupid. I never asked anyone for money. I ONLY share info that most people would hoard.

Cuz you called me a liar. And...the notoriety. Plus, I LOVE gambling when I already know the outcome.
Lastly, maybe by the time you come up with the money to pay the attorney, bitcoin will be worth $500. It isn't the money. It is just proving that random people on the Internet are almost always full of shit. You think I am full of shit. I am giving you an unbelievable opportunity to prove me wrong and actually profit quite a bit off of it. Publicly.
Just...take the bet. Get a few people here to join you if you can. Offset the attorney's fees and cash in on a killer deal. Do you have any idea how popular that would be on Reddit? If we could get a lot of people following this then it might even make it to the front page. That would be fun, wouldn't it? Also, you wouldn't have to look for work for a while, Mr Unemployed. Lastly...you should change your user name. For real. I mean...I probably should as well...but your's is just stupid. Who makes a user name which tells people they are unemployed? What is your skillset? Maybe I have a job for you. What languages can you code in?

We are full DC. I didn't build or design the solar. Our engineer did that. Our Chinese suppliers (for all of our equipment..lights, pumps, air conditioning, swamp collers, etc) worked with us to help us develop it as well. All of our devices are run on DC.
We have tons of batteries cuz we must run some of our greenhouses 24/7. We buy EVERYTHING from China (sorry America...).

This is a good response! Yes, I basically agree that your overall theme makes sense. We are about to create sauces, salsa, and other stuff with our leftover produce. That is one way to increase margins  (but there is a limit to the market for this..which is why we don't JUST make sauces).
This is why I will not allocate 100kw to this project.  I will allocate one greenhouse structure to it. I buy bit coins on the dips. If I can mine my bit coins at a lower overall cost, then I just made what I do less expensive.
I wanna start a genetic sequencing service. I was considering using the excess energy for this as well. This is actually my field. But i feel that I can squeeze more profit from this excess energy. The key is to compensate for the heat.
Either way, you make sense. And I can assure you that we are considering many things. Oil...? Didn't consider it. We cannot sell our seeds since we purchase from Baker Creek and cannot resell. But we do keep seeds and a more efficient method is the accompanying equipment.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:05:22
Fair enough. But still...you are wrong. I know this because I pay the bills.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:03:26
You are wrong. You are just too lazy to look up my post history. It is all in there.
@_date: 2017-07-02 06:49:56
His theory was stupid. An escrow service I am pitching? Man...
You will see the plants. You will see the miners. You will see the solar. For the record, you won't be impressed. But it is for real.
It's not a UCSD project. It is 100% mine. I am not overly proud. But I do enjoy building it out.
I didn't post the pics because I knew people here would be incited by the FAKE POSTERS. These FAKE POSTERS have become my puppets. I post something that I KNOW is incredulous and is related to mining. This gets the miners and their FAKE accounts out to start attacking and discrediting me. This has an effect that only I was able to deduce. It infuriated people who were not part of the FAKE POSTERS. Some of these people are newly minted bitcoin millionaires. They are stupid. They got rich by accident. They are dying to prove something. I push them into a corner and they feel compelled to complete the bet I tricked them into.
There. That is pretty much everything. The WHOLE thing. It is weird. I am weird. It does work. It will work over and over, even with this posting being in the permanent record. I was already rich but this strategy has made me millions. It is what I used to build this farm.
Oh...and I will, like I always do, post the pictures.
I guess...thank you Reddit for the thousands of bitcoins you have given me. And thank you, bitcoin-idiots for your riches. As I always say to your when I take your bitcoin, "Don't feel bad about this, you would have lost them to someone anyhow...at least i will put them to work."

It seems like you didn't read my original post very well. It's ok..it was a lot of numbers. Basically you feel that twenty panels that are 300 watts each are not enough for a miner. I disagree.
Then you came up with some other errors in my greenhouse setup...but the thing is that I don't know where you are getting the numbers for my solar array on the greenhouse. May I ask where you got those numbers? Because they are wrong.

In my experience,  this is not usually the case. To me, it seems that the first movers get clobbered by the second wave of businesses that used the first movers' mistakes to their advantage.
That being said, I already have a profitable business from my farm so using the excess solar is not as big of a risk as a true "first mover".
I do like your enthusiasm, however!!

@_date: 2016-07-10 17:33:54
Thank you. 
And yeah...for real...just get on Alibaba and look for suppliers of solar. I don't know what your duties are in Canada to bring in panels, but I doubt that they are crazy high. You should be paying around... $0.50 to $0.60 per watt for the ENTIRE system from China  (for an average-ish home). Shipping a  20' container is almost $900. Find some other cheap stuff you were thinking of buying and source it from China at the same time and you will save even more. You don't have to completely fill a container. You can buy all kinds of totally useless stuff from over there! Off grid batteries are about $180 for 12V 200ah lead acid (gel). The controllers are cheap. Use PayPal or AliPay. That way you are protected in case they send you the wrong part or something doesn't work. This happens sometimes. But it is not the norm.
Two electrics? Nice. LIke me. I have the electric Fiat. It has been pretty good. I liked my 3 years with it.

I still feel that someone is going to come up with a way to mine bitcoin in the desert. I feel that a lot of thought and planning will have to go into it for it to be highly competitive. Underground server rooms for insulation. Cool well water below for cooling the servers. The most efficient and well-sourced solar. Etc.

Dang...tough questions. I don't know yet. We are just about to order our mining equipment. I am guessing we won't go live for a while. We will work as fast as we can to get it set up.
I can tell you that we already have the infrastructure built. So...maybe that will help you estimate it? We have the cheapest electricity in the entire world in the Southern California desert. Well...maybe the middle east has slightly better sun. But our's is nearly as good.

True. I am gonna try to figure it out myself. I am not dumping a ton of money into the first test. I will allocate about 60 square feet for the first test. As for how many miners I will squash into this space...? I don't know yet.
A scientist? Yeah..kinda. A pioneer? No..I am basically a copy-cat. I hear a good idea. I research it. I see what others can do to help me. Then I pull the trigger and invest in a tiny test of it. None of the stuff I talked about here is my original idea. Not even using the excess solar for bitcoin. I student at UCSD basically gave me the idea first.
I wish I were smart. But I realized a long time ago...I aint.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:16:19
I thought about just solar mining. But I was too scared of the costs and risks. Then, I realized that our excess solar on our farm is the perfect way to test it. I can start with the absolute smallest setup. If it fails then I learned...or I am stupid (also possible ).
Maybe companies that switch to solar can employ the same strategy. Walmart stores can mine when they have excess. Homes can mine when they have excess. Solar farms can mine if they have excess. Imagine if you could profit from every second of extra energy you produed.
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:04:33
These types of homes have been around for a while now. Just Google it. You will see thousands of examples.
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:41:08
Hmmm...ok. what is the minimum order? When could you ship it, if we decided to try it? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:22:33
I don't know what to reasonably expect in terms of profit. It depends on what I do with the mined coins, for starters. When/if I ever sell them. Remember: this is excess solar so it is just an idea for making use of it. It will be a pretty substantial start up cost in the mining equipment. Of course we will start quite small. And only scale if it is profitable or hints at future profitability. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:08:55
Thank you for that!

Not yet. But we have it. And we have access to decent bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:19:50
I source from Alibaba. We have good suppliers but we are looking for different ones now. I can share who our supliers are. But the panels we purchase are not direct from the manufacturer. We hope to move to this level soon. We usually buy a  20' container of panels when we order.
We buy as we grow (for us, growth is adding new customers for our produce). And we set aside about 10% in case we have a customer that comes on line quicker than we expected. This 10% is what we are going to use for mining.
Land in the desert is cheap, btw....lots of you could do the same thing...if it actually works...which I suppose it may not. But then again...I will let everyone know if it does. Just buy cheap solar. DIY the installation. YouTube how to build ICF buildings. Buy a cheap minisplit from China. There you go. That is the secret formula.
Want another secret? Buy cheap land in the desert with well water underneath. Cool well water..not Desert Hot Springs water. Use this cool water for cooling.

We do have systems to run AC devices. But 99% of our farm is now DC.
We have on-site housing and some of them are AC.
Earthquakes....yeah...that is actually an issue. We just had one a few weeks ago. Thanks for bumming me out. Just kidding. But yeah...that is a real problem. If we had a bad one then it would cost us. For sure.

Yikes. That is too long! I am smart...I think I can do better!
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:02:02
Ok...so..permitting. Yeah...that is a nightmare. Luckily, we have scoured the permitting and county regulations.  We found every available loophole. I can't share all my trade secrets but I can tell you that we found a permanent way around much of the regulations in our way.
We have a lot of land out in the desert...well...from my perspective we have a lot. There are citrus farmers near us that have thousands of acres. We don't have anywhere near that much. Our primary farm had solar before we purchased it. We managed to get permitting to expand the existing system. Then we just kept growing our panels as we added customers.
Our new venture, on an adjacent piece of land we just bought, is another matter. Since very few people read my posts, I will tell you how we circumvented the permitting requirements on this new lot. We applied for special permitting for agriculture. The lot is 40 acres. We cannot go through the permitting process again for a solar array of the size we need on this piece of land. We bought the land for $23k. So this project is simply just a test of our new method of farming.
We found that greenhouses can be placed on the land and we can use batteries and battery devices inside, but we cannot put solar on the land. However, we can put solar inside the greenhouse. So we built a room for solar in each greenhouse. No permitting. All within the rules. 
This new farm is to test growing using sunlight in a climate controlled greenhouse that is cooled by solar powered evaporators and 69 degree well water that is misted throughout. Our main farm uses no sunlight...only LED and ceramic lights. Our main farm has a solar array to power it. All permitted. All legal. The new test farm will use this new method. Much less solar. About 300 watts per greenhouse. This farm will not be used for bitcoin mining. That can only happen on our solar array..because we need air conditioning and LOTS of power for the miners.
Our quality from China...hmm...I would say that now it is good. Before, it was mediocre. We just kept working with suppliers until we found the ones we can trust. It is not an easy process for large projects. Well...maybe it is for some people...but it was not simple for us. And I lived in China for years. And kinda speak the language. Many high quality components we have bought in the US were from the same manufacturers that we have used in China.
Boats from China arrive in 7 to 10 days to Long Beach. Then the next day they arrive on our farm. Not too bad. It costs about $850 to ship a 20' container. Very cheap now. And about $500 to ship from there to our farm. Plus customs duties.
I am not trying to say all of this is easy. But it is doable. And if a regular guy like me can do it...someone better than me can do it better. I don't feel threatened though...Cuz I own my land. And my land is valuable (just...no one gets it yet). The smarter guy can buy it from me.
Edit - I just realized that you were asking me about how I did the permits at my house. That was simple. DIY permitting. Pretty straightforward. I think it was kinda expensive though. But I cannot remember anymore.

I am always confused when people try to tell me stuff like this.
I think what they are really trying to say is this: when the current debt-based goal economic system collapses, THEN your money in banks is at risk.
But...that is semi-conspiracy type stuff. It may not happen in our lifetime. I feel it'll happen within 5 years, personally...but I am wrong a lot.
Either way: your bank account is safe from theft. People need to not worry about that.

That would be crazy if that turned out to be true...I can't imagine that it is. Is it..?

Excellent idea. I always offer anyone I do business with the option of bitcoin. Only a handful of Chinese vendors have taken me up on it. No one has EVER taken me up on paying me in bitcoin.

Yeah..but I think there are periods of no wind there...right?
But yeah. On the way to Palm Springs for sure. I believe that all the land for those wind farms has been bought, though. 
For the farm to be as profitable as possible, you must own the solar or the wind turbines. I feel there is no land for sale in that corridor. And if so...it is gonna be costly now cuz of the wind farms.
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:30:35
$10 USD? And you are implying that it is consistently and exactly  $10...so that means that it is likely to be related to something in the US...
No work, huh? That could just mean Force times Distance (sorta...displacement is also involved). But then again...there is almost nothing that requires no force whatsoever. Same for distance. Even information may have displacement.
I feel that it is impossible in 2016 to do this. Unless...hmmm...did you invent a time machine?
Is there ANY chance that you actually did some work at the beginning  by setting up the "reaction" and now the reaction is, essentially,  self-sustaining?
My guess is that it is related to gambling on a bitcoin-related site. You mentioned that you get it every week. But that is impossible to prove...unless your time machine goes to the end of time. And even then...I am not sure it would prove it.
If you are wrong about the fact that no work is required then my second guess is that someone gave you bitcoin and you sell $10 per week. Of course, you implied it was $10 per week...forever...so either you are assuming bitcoin will rise always to cover your $10...or USD heads to zero. And cuz of infinity, it has to be that USD goes to nearly zero (I think).

I cannot imagine being away from a big city. I thoroughly enjoy escaping. Of course, for me, that usually means skiing or boarding in a small town. But I have to come back to the bigger city.
Maybe when I retire, I will live some months in a small town somewhere in Wyoming or Montana...but it has to be at the base of a mountain so I can still ski everyday.
I do, however, like the idea of having my house and land provide for me. And, of course I love the idea of not being connected to utilities. In the end though..,that connection isn't that big of a deal...it is just a monthly expense  (which does seem to only go up over time).
Just...don't go live in the woods and forsake humanity.

Buy from Alibaba. Even if you need a small system. You can ship a 20' container from China to Long Beach, CA. If there is other stuff you wanna buy from China, then just include it in your container. Here is what I just bought in my last 20' container: solar panels,  batteries, an electric 4 wheel ATV, ICF stuff, Some air conditioners, insulation...and some other crap. I saved about $50k by doing this. You still have to pay customs and shipping from the port to your location.
About 20% of the suppliers will accept bit coin (cuz they wanna have money they can move outta there). And most take PayPal but you have to pay the 2.5%. However,  it is worth it sometimes if you didn't get what you thought....which happens sometimes. Also, Alipay is the same. So...it is safe. And you will save about 50 to 70% off from US suppliers.
My electric ATV was $2200. In the US, it costs $12,000.

You don't even need to become our apprentice. Just copy what we do and find your own land to build it yourself. Or...rent the land. That is an even cheaper entry point into this.
Also...remember, our vertical farming solution works. Our mining operation...I have no idea if it will. Wanna make good money selling lettuce, peppers, basil, etc? Then you'd probably benefit from checking out our new farm. Wanna mine in the desert?  Wait a couple months for us to let you know if it even worked.

I have the same dream. Either way, though, I want clean energy. I hate that it is often over 100 degrees in the summer in San Diego now. What a total bummer.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:53:18
Yeah...you nailed pretty much two of our looming issues. The well below us is HUGE. Like....SUPER HUGE. It is a lake the size of San Diego (the city). It is about 120 feet below ground. And...it is about 800 feet deep. It's gigantic. 
The first issue is water pressure. We have ro increase this. It just means another well has to be installed. So...not the biggest issue...unless the county tells us that we cannot. Then we have to upgrade the original.
The second issue is the draught. My town has no water supply and rely solely on this well. The well naturally replenishes. But the problem is that citrus and date farmers have been suckling this well dry for about 60 years. There is about 20 or 25 years of water available at the current rate they are using it.
California has given themselves 20 years to come up with a plan for our town. If my vertical farming idea does not convince these farmers to switch to this...then the entire town will become a ghost town in 20 years. This is part of the reason I am so open with our farming methods. I want my neighbors' farms to copy me. So that my investment in the land does not go to zero.
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:52:21
The main problem is that my profit margins on the farm are astronomical. I love bitcoin...like...probably WAY too much. So, we have the excess power and just assumed that it was a cost we had to bear. Then...my bitcoin-centered brain started thinking about using this excess solar to mine.
Listen: it really may not work. But the investment on my end is reduced because I already have the energy just sitting around. Maybe there is a better use for it. One could argue that we need to invest in better salespeople to sign up new accounts for our produce. This is what my friends tell me. And...I kinda agree that it is a valid point. But still...we built the system to have excess solar so that we were always able to accommodate a new customer that just refused to wait 3 months for us to get our infrastructure sourced from China, then built, then the first crop delivered.
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:00:56
I have struggled with this question for the past 2 years. Who to invest in for vertical farming...? 
If you are like me, you want to focus on companies that have a VERY long term plan for this industry. Lighting and LED manufacturers...? Yeah...they will profit from it. But, there are already so many of them...the competition will erode margins quickly.
Equipment manufacturers...? Yeah...but the equipment is kinda basic. I copied a bunch of stuff already.
So that left me with the commercial growers. Some are public. Most aren't. And here is the thing that people in the vertical industry don't often disclose: transportation costs are what will you. Once you get more than a couple hundred miles from your market, you will start having high transport costs. The key is to find companies that own the land and have invested in the best equipment. The ones who are using solar or low cost energy (basically wind or solar). This basically jmeans that, if you wanna make a lot of mone in it, you need to do it yourself or find a farm and invest in them. Well...those are my opinions on it at least.
Also, I feel that high desert areas or actual deserts near major markets are areas that will constantly be at a competitive advantage. Unless there is a really windy place near a major market...there probably is but I don't know enough about that stuff.
Lastly, water. They gotta have cheap water.

Thanks, Random Dude on the Internet!
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:42:40
Are you the guy in the video? We buy these container homes directly from China and ship them to our farm. Each 20' container home (complete with all appliances,  shower, toilet, etc) costs us $9k assembled. We ship it with other stuff for our farm (like solar panels, batteries...whatever will fit in the space available).
We can buy them unassembled for about $6500.
As for living out in the woods...it seems like a fun weekend for me. But I am not ready (and probably never will be) for that. I need places to go. I like eating out. I play basketball almost everyday. It just doesn't suit my lifestyle. But I actually get it.

@_date: 2016-07-09 23:59:39
Zero. I don't get any tax rebates or credits. My solar is from China. Not on the list of manufacturers that qualify for the credit. And we installed it ourselves. So...no installation credit.
We asked several companies to bid on this project. We paid about 10% of what the LOWEST PRICED company was quoting us.
Fuck credits. Fuck government subsidies of solar. I realized a while ago that these subsidies were meant to slow down solar adoption. In the most sneaky way...by getting the government involved.
Solar City came to my house last year for a quote to get me down to net-zero on my house in San Diego. I have an average electric bill of $1800. Guess how much they quoted me for such a system? $235k. The best part...that would only get me 80% to net-zero. I would still pay 20% of my $1800 monthly bill. They said I didn't have enough roof space and I lived in a canyon which meant that I would need special permitting to place it there and they felt it was too complex.
They showed me the numbers and they do give me 30% off...so the total was still very high. And they showed me how I will save money after 20 years. That was SO funny. 20 years!!?? Who the Fuck lives in their house for 20 years?
So I bought it from China and got 100% off my electric bill...did it myself. And it cost me $40k...actually less..cuz I am just rounding up.
@_date: 2016-07-14 02:39:22
Wow...Jakarta. this forum is REALLY all over!
Well...here is how I learned about vertical farming. I do not know if it will something you can do or if it will even make sense. But...it is what is did.
I sold some bitcoin I had been holding for several years. I took this money and started looking for ways to diversify my profits. I was working at the University of California San Diego at the time. There was a small group of researchers who were working on genetic solutions for farms in countries that needed plants that were easy to grow.
They told me about a new type of farming. Vertical farming. I listened to these scientists explaining all the benefits to using this method of farming. Then they invited me to view a small vertical farm on campus. Then they told me that the profits for this type of farming are much higher than traditional farming.
I started becoming interested. They gave me some old equipment to try to grow stuff in my house. I gave this equipment to a friend who is more responsible than me. He was excited to test it out. He grew a few crops of tomatoes, lettuce, basil and cilantro. When I saw how it worked...I was convinced.
So, I started looking into the business aspects. I tried to find companies that were publicly traded and focused on vertical farming. There really weren't any.
Then I started talking to the scientists on campus and asking them all the questions I could think of to see if there was some problem with this type of farming. Tha is when I learned about the costs of shipping and the initial investment costs for lighting and power.
So...I decided to find a way to reduce those costs. Well...I could purchase the lights from China. That is one way to reduce costs. But the power...that was difficult to figure out. I thought about the cheapest power. I researched it and decided that solar from China was the absolute cheapest energy in America. So, I sourced solar from China.
I started small. And built one greenhouse. I learned how to solve the problems by talking to researchers who had experience with vertical farming. I copied their plans. Then I grew. I took all the produce I grew from that first greenhouse and gave it to anyone I could to see how they liked it. They loved it. I bought the best seeds. I grew with the best nutrients. I followed everything that the scientists told me to do. It worked.
Then, I started getting orders for the produce. I started visiting restaurants, hotels, and large businesses. I figured out how to sell it directly to the end user. Then I grew the farm.
We ate still kind of small, but we are growing very quickly. This business can generate at least 100% net profit. My research convinced me that this is a very high margin business. I tested it. This turned out to be true.
Tto answer your question about the most beneficial research: speaking to small and medium size vertical farmers. Most of them are difficult to speak to...they are nervous to tell the world that the profit in this business is unbelievable. But..you will find that some of them are happy to talk about it. Like me!
To answer your other question about what is the best thing...I would say...try it yourself in your home. Or backyard. If you want to build a small greenhouse.iiiI recommend it. You can build a cheap greenhouse for a couple hundred dollars. Seeds are cheap. I recommend buying a small aeroponic system (if you can keep your system at 70 degrees F. Or build a hydroponic system if the temperature is higher or lower than that. Once you see what you can do on your own...you will basically get it.
It is not hard. It is not easy. It takes time. You will lose crops. You will learn. And if you like it enough..you will try to turn it into a business yourself. If you want to just invest...your will need to find a farm that is just starting out (but already has a working solution). Your money will help them grow...if they can prove that they are already profitable. 
Anyhow, I hope that gives you an idea, at least.

Yeah...sort of. I read that article this morning on CNBC.
There are lots of difference between them and me. They don't have cooling costs. I do. They buy power monthly. I had to buy my own solar array.
However, my solar array has excess so I will try using it for mining. If it fails, my solar array still makes me money from my veggie farm.
Hard to really compare us. They are probably better off than me. They also make the Asics. I gotta buy them from a reseller.
Hard to say..but..if all goes according to my plan,  we will all know if it works in a couple of months!

Ok, I am getting some people messaging me to call me out. It would be easier if you just post in this thread. I rarely respond to people in private messages.
If you really are interested in starting another bet, then everyone here must know by now that I am always open for that, I just ask that we make it public. 
So, it seems that this post is just going to irritate people again. I am guessing that miners are irritated that I decided to publish how someone could actually mine for a profit.
Two people have messaged me asking me to not discuss reselling  miners. Apparently I am not the inventor of that idea. It looks like miners do not want smaller guys mining and then placing their slightly used machines for sale to profit. I am guessing that the miners will now try to drive this post into obscurity.
Bummer. I feel that the info I am publishing here is useful and has value. Oh well, no one was ever gonna do it. I literally shared my entire basic business plan with costs and revenues. Because no one here has the money or resources to even copy it. Helll, no one here has enough resources to even try it in their garage. So...you miners should not be nervous. Your precious resell market is still protected. These people are poor. Stop worrying that I am gonna give away your secrets.

You're probably right. I am one of those guys who kinda bumble his way through his investing life by picking the dumbest ideas.
Kinda like bitcoin. I mean...bitcoin is going to zero, right? The money I made from it is just imaginary.
The solar is expensive, as you said. So...expensive stuff can never return a profit, right? Super computers are expensive. They seem like a horrible business idea. Mona Lisa is costly. That is a losing bet, for sure.
You do understand that I already paid for the solar, don't you? So...is your idea to not do this? And you're certain it won't work, right?
May I ask how much money you make, on average, via investing? Also, since you only invest in stuff that is cheap to buy...what types of things do you invest in? Also, how do you bet against companies that make expensive stuff?
@_date: 2016-07-09 22:31:08
I will share the info on what it cost us. And what we earned. We may not sell the coins so I can only share what we mined in that case.
But remember, my solution is different. It is kinda like the gig-economy. I mean...sorta. Like how my cousin has lots of spare time at his mom's house cuz she is nice to let him live in the basement for free and he smokes too much pot. He has extra bandwidth to drive for Uber, in between marathons of Adult Swim. --- We have the extra bandwidth on our farm so we are gonna drive for Uber (that's a metaphor).

I thought about moving to St Kitts. But after spending enough time there...I decided that ithe just wouldn't make me happy. The island is beautiful. The views....wow...hard to describe unless you have seen them.
But the people. Wow...they can be nice. But that is about it. I have never seen such a poorly run and corrupt government. The population,  while educated well too high school lacks anything beyond that and the lazines...whew...I don't know how to describe it. Epic laziness. 90% of the island is SO opposed to actually working. It is like pulling teeth to get anything done.
I am buying investment property there. But I won't live there. I can take a lot of stuff...but laziness all around me when I need things done...that is something I cannot handle.
What would you build these power systems for? $USD.
In your opinion, as someone who has done solar mining...will it work for us out in the desert? Can I make 0.1 bitcoins per month from each setup? To do that...would I need to run 24/7? Each greenhouse generates between $800 and $1500 per month in net profit for us. Can I add a tenth of a bitcoin to that each month, do you think?
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:44:54
No. Medical Marijuana, while I do invest in it (but rarely use it), is complicated.
To be honest,  we are probably going to allocate one of our separate properties for recreational marijuana. I expect it to pass in November. I expect it to be actually legal and all the regulations/licensing worked out by the end of 2017.
Regarding marijuana...the lure is the margin. We have done the math. It is still going to a very profitable business. But if we actually get into it, then we will basically flood the market with the cheapest marijuana ever. We currently grow it for $28 per pound in our aeroponic systems. This includes the machinery for trimming and all labor. Current market price in California is about $250 per ounce (retail). And about $1800 per pound (wholesale).
Wanna hear something SUPER crazy? If we get into recreational marijuana...we are gonna sell it for $39.95 per ounce. I hate that this industry is all drug dealers pretending to be medical suppliers. It is the worst. Also, it is not a medicine for about 99% of us. Sorry to break that to everyone. When I occasionally use it..I am getting high...not medicating.
Wanna do the same thing? It is easy. I can tell everyone how to do it. You can buy an acre in the desert for about $5k. You can grow about 20 pounds in a simple greenhouse. This greenhouse will cost you about $4k for EVERYTHING (the greenhouse, the solar, the cooling system, the aeroponic equipment). Labor in the desert for farm hands is about $10 per hour. And you can hire illegal labor for less. You can easily put 25 greenhouses on this property. Do the math. Compete with me.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:59:22
No. I included that. Each farmhand can handle thousands of plants of this type of crop. The main labor cost is cutting the plant and putting it into the trimmer.
30 small aeroponic plants produce 1 pound of dried bud. An 80 Sq foot greenhouse. We can fit it 400 of these plants in the greenhouse. Each farmhand can manage many of these tiny greenhouses as a full time job.
I based those numbers on our system. We are aquaponic and more efficient than most. You can do it with nutrient solution for about $10 more per pound. Maybe... $15. But still...cheap.
You do know it is a weed, right? It is a little harder to grow than basil. And does require trimming at the end. That is why you need the trimming machine. Otherwise your labor is very high.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:02:00

I detailed just the mining costs. The only thing I didn't include in my original numbers is a small air conditioner. I spend $650 on one from China.
Yes. I believe it will work with just solar and miners. It depends on your sun, though. And your rent.

@_date: 2016-07-15 17:59:26
Which is why we are only testing it. We expect to produce 6 to 13 hours per day of solar to run the miners (depending on the time of year).
We'll see...I expect to be able to profit from daytime mining only. Of course...those are just my expectations...which are often wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:50:27
Cuz that price is inflated and won't last. The first guy to come out with the price of $39.95 will create a brand. Then, a legitimate commercial business will come in and buy me.
Cuz...most business are fine making 100% margin. Only drug dealers make 1,000% margin.
The bottom will fall out of pricing so fast that people will be amazed. The only thing that will keep prices high will be taxes. It seems really simple to me. I can grow an ounce for about $2 (commercially with my off-grid desert operation). This is a fully cut and groomed ounce of marijuana. If I can do it...lot of other people can do it.
How long do you think before someone else says, "Hmmm...I am a regular businessman/woman...I would be OK making 40% margin"
Everybody I ever talk to about this tells me I am crazy. But...I don't think I am crazy. I feel like I am kinda smart. And I am kinda a realist.
The price will be $39.95 because it costs $2 to make. And regulations/taxes will make it that high. Without such taxation...it should cost about $5 per ounce at retail.
Chew on that. How much does an ounce of basil cost? Marijuana is a little more labor intensive than basil. How do I know? I grow both. An ounce of basil sells for less than a dollar.

We are not connected to the grid. I don't expect that program to persist much longer. I am concerned that connecting to the grid will open me up to greater regulation.

Thank god you have the internet. Your life would be fucking garbage, otherwise.
Hey... no one is gonna read this.  Can I ask you a serious question? Is life really nice and easy for you? I truly mean no offense this time. The other times, I was actually being offensive.

Alright. Never mind. Sorry for the comment.
@_date: 2016-07-10 00:07:08
Fair enough. For the record, I won't remember this conversation in 5 years.
My track record since 2001 has been to double my investment money every 3 years. I have, of course blown that out of the water with bitcoin. So it is kinda moot for me to even talk about doubling every 3 years now...cuz I can lose out from now til I die and I will still have made more fiat money than I could ever need.
But you are right. Every 7 or 8 years seems to be quite good for the average investor of stocks. But I invest in businesses directly. I feel that owning or being an active investor has a higher rate of return (if you invest in what you know).
Just putting money in my 401k...yeah...8 years to double...that seems pretty decent. But if I take control of it then I expect more.
It is possible that my correction is coming, however.
Also...sorry for thinking I have more information than the market.
@_date: 2016-07-09 20:06:33
Thanks! My idea is kinda different than just building a solar array for bitcoin mining. I have a vertical farm that uses solar. I am just using the excess for mining.
I would, however, be VERY interested in any tool that would help us become more profitable.

Actually,I just got the numbers run for June and I was impressed with how I did. So I posted the update.
All this stuff you are accusing me of is just your opinion.
Also, who cares if I take bitcoin from idiots? I deserve them more than they do. Someone else would have taken them from these idiots, regardless. At least I am doing something with them.
And yes, there is a coordinated effort here to keep people away fom mining. I think everyone should mine..but that is cuz I am weird.
I agree...we are a very ironic generation.
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:30:54
What are you "putting up"with? That is SO stupid. As if my sharing of info is some great weight I have placed around your neck.
I don't care if you take me seriously. I am just documenting the birth of my company. From its inception to where it is now. I feel compelled to share my inside info because I used this subreddit to fund my crazy idea. 
You asked me to document it, umm...what do you think I am doing, dipshit? Corroborated? You dumb-ass...I invite nearly everyone out to my farm. Multiple times. They came out. They lost money.
I have a better idea: you are sure I am making it up, right? Bet me. Oh...that's right...you ain't got no bitcoin. Or money. You just have an Internet connection at your mom's house.

People are messaging me saying I am trying to scam people here. Ummm...I am super curious where I have asked for money?
Also, can't you just post here in this thread? Most people who message me just threaten me. So I rarely read those messages.
I get it.  I am unlikeable. I mean...who wouldn't hate someone who tries to share what they are working on with a group of people who claim to be interested in stuff like this? People who share are the worst, aren't they? 
I am not telling people to invest $15 million in a bitcoin mining operation/solar farm/vertical farm. I am doing that myself. Nowhere in my posts have I ever asked people to give me money.
Is there ANY chance that everyone here is stupid?  I know that comes off as mean. But let's think about it. Pretty much everyone here is mostly just hoping to get rich quick. They claim to be interested in changing the world and all that though a decentralized currency. But they just wanna get rich without working hard.
If you guys were that smart then you would have understood bitcoin a long time ago. You would have gone in very big. But you didn't. I did. And I am still doing that. I am guessing that is annoying for the majority of people here.
For those of you who are actually interested, my numbers are for real. They are based on my books for the business I started with the money I swiped form a handful of idiots here.

I am buying 1,000 miners. Is that a lot? Would you build a mining operation in a State like Washington (where it could be $0.03 per kwh)? How much would that cost you per machine? Or...do you not actually know?
What if the $7,000 invested in solar could be turned  instantly towards your vertical farm to produce higher margin produce? What if you owned your solar equipment after you bought it and could still use it for your energy needs?
This is the main difference between building a mining operation in a low cost electricity market vs using your existing infrastructure to offset costs, and investing in solar. I already have buildings's and HVAC. I already have volume pricing on batteries and panels.
Also, according to your logic, you should technically never buy new tech because it will be replaced by better tech. You do understand that this kinda just keeps happening, don't you?  If everyone waited to jump in...no one ever would.
@_date: 2016-07-16 08:34:21
We can source 12V 200ah deep cycle batteries from China at a cost of $151 landed in San Diego. 6V 150ah is significantly cheaper. Also, we are using our excess solar and batteries. So...they are already paid for...except now we are gonna burn through them quicker.
The math tells me that it is close. But it depends on the amount of sun we get on average. My math also tells me that I don't know how much sun I will actually get. So...you are right (maybe). But also...maybe it is worth testing. And there is a chance you are wrong...but probably I am wrong. Cuz of mathematic ineptitude. 
Either way, I apologize for possibly making a bad business decision. Lastly,  I have a PhD in mathematics.

Haha. Yes. We do. We follow California Prop 215. But this is not a business for us. We applied for medical Marijuana licensing over a year ago. But we give it all away. It is strictly a test bed for us in the anticipation of recreational passing this November. It represents LESS than 0.01% of what we grow commercially.
Don't everybody flip out. We are not pot dealers. We have NEVER sold marijuana. Ever. Not yet...

Run it by him...if he feels that you have a legitimate case then we will try to work out a settlement to avoid court.

I kinda went ALL-IN on potentially disastrous investments. Of course...I used my bitcoin profits to build the entire thing...so...maybe those people are wrong.
Also, for every $3000 we use to build a greenhouse, we make $900 per month in net profit. Each greenhouse is about 120 square feet. We have enough land for about 10,000 greenhouses.

I would buy the residents out of Saba in the Caribbean. Then form a new government. There are about 2,000 residents. Most of them are super poor. There is already a medical school there. The island is beautiful. I have thought about it before. You can buy citizenship on St. Kitts (cuz of their corrupt gov't) for a flat fee of $250k per person, and an additional small amount per nuclear family member. Or you can buy a house or piece of land on certain parts of the island for a minimum of $400k and citizenship is included (for a smaller fee).
If you offer to buy 2,000 properties on St. Kitts and give each poor resident of Saba $250,000 (plus the $400k house on St. Kitts) then they might take it. But...that is about $1.3 billion. Still...worth it, in my opinion. St. Kitts is sitting on a ticking time bomb of gov't debt. The people there are lazy as fuck. They all just want to retire early and get their gov't social security. The gov't spent all their social security so this would replenish that fund (well...the gov't would actually blow it on other shit and the ministers would find a way to steal a bunch of it...but who cares?).
Of course the island of Saba is a Dutch territory. So, that would have to be resolved.
Or, find another Caribbean island and do the same thing. It doesn't have to be Saba.
I would pay $1million for my share. I would put it in escrow right now if someone wanted to pursue something like this. But Liberia..? No. That place is gonna fucking suck. Tiny. Cold. And shitty neighbors.
Building a giant floating city is too expensive. Budget over-runs will ruin it. And in 15 years, I would expect that it would be in dire need of repair.
But, I love your general idea! I really dislike my country...and that is a total bummer.

Yeah...the Chinese...they are too difficult to compete against. If they decided to do the same thing, then we would never be able to compete. They make the solar equipment. They work 6 days a week. They pay less in labor.
The Chinese suppliers for our farm are already "stealing" our designs and one of them is already building a copy of my farm in the Chinese desert. It doesn't really bother me because we cannot compete at all. Plus, they have given us a lot of good ideas that we stole from them!
In fact,  they gave us one of the most amazing ideas ever this week for my farm. I can't belive they thought about that...and I didnt.
