Pretty kind of you! Thanks! Your help is of course a thing I would like to have. Please, feel free to upload as many pull requests as you'd like! If you wish to build a software just like mine, I then invite you to make my code yours.

If everyone in China moves to Japan, isn’t it just A LOT worse? I mean, if they all move to Japan, we will have a way worse centralization problem, since Japan will hold all Chinese investors + the old Japanese ones.
If China were bad, what will Japan be now?

Yes. There is a predicted crash around 7 thousand. Once the BTC reaches 7 thousand, I highly recommend you selling yours to me, preferably for a discounted price (you know, risk management takes its costs)

So almost everywhere is dangerous, since almost everywhere has an inflatonary currency? I am still a bitcoin beginner.

Wait. Is it common? I am worried now. Is the GreenAddress for iOS safe?

Thank you very much for the reply! Would you mind if I ask you where you store your recovery words? Did you put them in a safe? Or something like that?

What is a reliable way to generate a paper wallet? I mean, if they generated it somehow, it is pretty easy for them to store the generated code somewhere.
