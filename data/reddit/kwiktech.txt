Can someone tell me whats the quickest way to buy bitcoin? I want to get in before the rush

As far as I can tell one person is in control of at least 25-30% of bitcoin. Maybe even more! That just looking at all the addresses that had a transaction on Sep 7, 2014 10:31:10 AM

Another interesting thing is if you sort the list by last transaction in/out.
It appears a large percentage of bitcoin is controlled by very few people.

If I have 10 apples for sale and 1 goes missing it instantly makes the other apples more valuable.

Yes I would like to trade. But more importantly I'm looking for reliable sources of crypto info and news. 
Surely someone on earth was saying "watch out for bitstamp, they use single signature addresses for cold storage. How seriously do you think they take security." 
Who was saying things like that? I want to follow or subscribe to them...

Single sig addresses are for morons...

Maybe your system is already compromised and the bitcoin is gone... 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:09:30
Yeah that's not the case... All these addresses seem to have equal amounts in them. Doesn't look random to me

All I see is pussy...

This is the sort of stuff I'm looking for...

I doubt many people will hold much bitcoin in trezor. I would guess most if not all trezor users are in the bottom30% of bitcoin andhold less than 100

How are we seeing such large percentage movements in BTC price when the top 40% of bitcoin holders aren't selling... ???
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:59:35
What the hell happened on that date and time?
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:42:00
What does it mean?
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:47:12
My point exactly.
How is this a free market then.
What effect on price does the bottom 30% make?
Not a lot
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:57:35
Want to see something insane? Sort the list by last transaction in and have a look at "Sep 7, 2014 10:31:10 AM"
Its like 1 person is in control of most of bitcoin. Its crazy
