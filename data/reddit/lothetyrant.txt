Yeah it’s a shame that it happens though, and because now it’s a commodities in the hands of a larger general public people want something to be done, but if the newbies would have done their homework before investing they would know the market can be influenced by a few large holders

I think it has to do with the initial amount of funds in the account and the way it was verified, I was awarded $750 weekly limit cause I had an decent amount of money available, but my mom was given 2500 cause she had like 20k in her account I could be totally wrong though
I think it might be to prevent people from making an account getting a loan and dumping a bunch loaned money in but again I could be wrong l, just to help regulation

Oh okay that’s what I️ was wondering so there are “transaction numbers” in the block chain to be able to recoup your bitcoin?

That’s why from technological stand point I think IOTA makes more sense and has better application which will bring greater worth but it’s hard to say with so many eyes on bitcoin currently
