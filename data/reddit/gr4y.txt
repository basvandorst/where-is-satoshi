I think a compromise could be made. The default bitcoin client can sign messages (and probably a majority of others). Why not require a signed message with the current address to change the address? This would maintain privacy, allow easy changes for the owner, and would be near impossible for an attacker if the owner protected their keys somewhat decently. An attacker would have to compromise both keys and account to steal from the users exchange account.

I never meant to imply so. Simply that those that do follow up might discover bitcoins.

They gave enough details on how to get to Silk Road (just the name would have been plenty). Then they describe it works with TOR. If people go there, they will discover that they have to pay with Bitcoins to get the goods.
The Silk Road may put up a tutorial on how to obtain and use Bitcoins if they get asked enough. A little Googling will result in step by step instructions after they learn they have to use Bitcoins to get their drugs.
Seems counter-intuitive to even make a story of The Silk Road, it will lead them to Bitcoins anyway.

From what I understand (don't hold me to this, they might have changed) it uses something like [Blockchain.info]( instead of the actual block chain info.

Am I the only one not seeing it?

During the Prohibition era, companies would sell bricks of barley with instructions on what NOT to do, because you would make alcohol.
So, why not follow their example?


Because you can't sell Bitcoin mining units. And if you don't want to rub it in their faces, don't put the NOT FOR BITCOIN MINING on the tag (though, this might decrease sales).
Just don't call it a bitcoin mining machine.

I would do it to see if I could create some kind of ruckus over it. eBay account holder gets banned for accepting Bitcoin? Holy hell, that could cause some trouble if what some of the comments and what you are saying is true.
Go through the terms of agreements, specifically that part on the 'other' payments. Make sure it's verifiable in some fashion. That won't be difficult at all with bitcoin, all you would have to do is give the buyer a bitcoin address (a new address might be best, to show that you got a particular amount, and you know you gave that address to that specific person).
I would also check with support, as you said. Maybe look for others that are already doing it? Also, make sure to save any communications from support so you can give that to them later if you decide to do it, and you get banned for it.
That is, if you're willing to risk your account. This could be some big news if there is a lash back and some press is generated out of it (not that many would care...)

The same thing that prevents you from doing so (aside from a lack of knowledge on how to do so).
The entire system is an agreement between computers that this one person can send this much money to this other person, because they have money in their account.
Sure, you could tell the entire system you are send 1,000,000฿ to me, but the address you are sending them from doesn't have 1,000,000฿ to send. The servers will just disregard and ignore your request to send that money.
