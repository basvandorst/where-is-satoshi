The incidence of scam bitcoin wallets on Apple's IOS platform seems to be much higher than the incidence of such scam wallets on Google's Android platform. This is quite ironic, because Apple's app store is supposedly highly curated, while Google's app store is not.
What's a good explanation for this? Why aren't the malware authors focusing more on distributing their scam wallets for the Android platform?
Something is not right here.

What they are saying *sounds* like predictions. E.g.:
- "[B]anks that control Europe’s financial system are entering a death spiral..."
- "[I]n such a future scenario, private savings accounts, retirement funds, and IRAs of average citizens could be stolen by the banks..."
- "[R]ed flags continue to emerge that point to a terminal diagnosis for the system as a whole..."
They have chosen words that will cause the average reader to think that European banks will die, IRAs will be stolen by banks, and the entire system will die. But they make their language so vague that regardless of what actually happens, they can never be wrong.
I find Reuters much more reliable. Reuters doesn't use vague language that sounds like predictions, and they do report real news.

[ I posted the below comments as a separate text posting and it was almost immediately deleted. Not sure why, maybe because I mentioned a different subreddit. ]
I'm very suspicious about the two videos that I have seen online that document this alleged pepper spray attack on a young woman wearing a "Make Bitcoin Great Again" hat.
Video 1, two versions:
Video 2, two versions:
Both videos spliced together:
Video 1 abruptly stops at the instant the pepper spraying was completed. What are the odds that the person with the camera would have stopped recording at that exact time? Or that the person recording the video would have edited it to cut it at the exact point where we would want to see more? None. A normal person would have made sure to include the aftermath, and made sure to record who had just done the pepper-spraying. And yet, every copy of this video that I have seen online stops at the same instant. This is not normal.
Furthermore, Video 1 is in portrait format, which nobody in their right mind would use to deliberately record an outdoor activity. Yes, I know people sometimes use portrait format for videos, but it's always in a moment of panic when something unexpected suddenly happens. But in this case, there is no panic to begin with -- it's just a calm, orderly interview. The video is in portrait format presumably to give us a narrow angle of view.
Video 2 stops at the exact same instant as Video 1, and does not show the aftermath, and does not attempt to make sure we will be able to recognize the perpetrator of the attack. What are the odds that two different people would stop recording at the exact same instant? Or that, alternatively, two different people would edit their videos and cut them off at the exact same instant? That two different people would both take care to make sure we have no idea who was holding the pepper spray? That two different people would both take care to not show us the aftermath of the attack?

Authy creates an illusion of security, but it relies on your cellphone number being not compromised. If somebody steals your cellphone number, they can steal your Authy account. There's a 24-hour delay during which Authy sends you email. If you miss that email, your account could be history.
Reliance on a cellphone should be optional. Any service provider that makes such reliance mandatory is putting your data at risk.

Generally, your bitcoins should be in your possession, in the sense that the keys should be in your own (preferably open-source) wallet, with the seed words suitably backed up. Your bitcoin balance in your Coinbase account should be kept at exactly $0.00 except just before and just before you do any buying or selling.
I highly recommend moving your bitcoins into your own wallet (with the seed words suitably backed up). And keep them there unchanged until the entire hard fork situation is over and in the past. At that point, do some reading and you'll see plenty of discussion about how to do safe bitcoin transactions.
Depending on the amounts involved, you might want to get a hardware wallet like a Trezor or a Ledger. Or, generate a 2-of-2 wallet within Copay and keep the keys on two different devices.
Seriously, if you store any bitcoins in any exchange, Coinbase or not, there's a good possibility you will eventually regret doing so. Some exchanges get hacked, some lose funds after a hard fork, some vanish taking bitcoins with them, some declare bankruptcy, and some do other things that we don't know what they are because they haven't happened yet but will sooner or later.
Edit: Also note that your having to post here to get an explanation of the email from Coinbase, instead of either them having written the email so you needed no explanation, or simply asking them to explain, suggests just how bad things are in exchanges in general and/or in Coinbase in particular. Nobody should have to ask random strangers to explain email from a service provider.

Zerohedge is mostly crap. I would have said all crap but I'm feeling generous as bitcoin has been shooting up. :-)
Example: In this posting, dated June 12, they claim: "It’s surprising to see the main media have tried to keep this silent..."
But four days before that, Reuters had already reported:
"Belgium's central bank (NBB) on Wednesday said it had blocked the accounts of Optima Bank to oversee the winding down of its operations.
"Optima Bank, which in 2014 said it would exit its traditional banking business, still held some 90 million euros ($102.5 million) of deposits."
Reuters told us that the eventual winding down of the bank was already known in 2014, something apparently not known to Zerohedge.
Reuters is a real news agency. They report real facts. And they seem to get them before Zerohedge does.

The people at zerohedge seem to lack even the most basic understanding of how virtual currencies work. They are gravely mistaken in their belief that Et?????m was hacked. Or they believe that Th? D?o is bitcoin's largest competitor, which is even more absurd.
They don't understand the difference between Th? D?o on the one hand and et?????m itself on the other hand.
Also, the et???s have not been stolen yet. They are in a state of limbo, and unavailable to the hacker for some more weeks. An upcoming soft fork will make them permanently unavailable to the hacker, after which a hard fork will restore them to their original owners.
Please read zerohedge for meaningless gossip, not for real information. I recommend more reliable sources like WSJ, Reuters, Bloombert, etc. They hire reporters who better understand concepts like fact checking.

Wealth is not debt, and debt is not wealth. Otherwise, merely borrowing money would make your wealthy.
Suppose Apple borrows a huge amount of money to build a new campus. Now Apple has a large amount of cash from the loan. The chart gets bigger even though the total amount of wealth that exists has not increased.
Ultimately, the chart as a whole has no meaning that I can find. You could with as much usefulness add your heart rate to your shoe size.

I added a couple of comments to their official response thread.
Here they are again, below.
It looks like the problem is that he deposited bitcoins and wants to withdraw fiat, and you're worried that that (somehow) constitutes money laundering.
The solution is so simple. Send him back his original deposit in the form of bitcoins. No conversion of bitcoins to fiat, no money laundering, problem solved.
If you don't want to do that, but you want to keep his deposit until the issues you mention are resolved, then the *wrong* way to do that is to do that is to just keep the funds. The *right* way to do that is put the funds into a trust administered by a neutral third party, and give him proof that that has been done. That way he can be assured you aren't just stealing his funds.
I looked at their terms at:
It says clearly that: "As a condition of You becoming a Customer, You must comply with the Customer Acceptance Policy for verifying Your identity...."
But nowhere does it say anything like "As a condition of withdrawing funds...."
So I don't see how their assertion "[w]e implore the original poster to comply with our request to resolve this issue with our Support Team as per the Terms of Service they agreed to" makes sense. If he's a customer, he already supplied all the information that was required to become a customer.

Not 5%. After you subtract their fee, it's more like 2%. 
All of their discounts work the same way. You pick the discount you want, let's say 10%. But the higher the discount the greater their fee, so the discount you finally get would not be 10%, it might be only 5% or so.
They could easily calculate the discount *after* subtracting their fee. They your expectations would match the reality. They could, but they don't.
The problem isn't that they charge a fee — obviously they need to — but rather, that their calculations are deceptive.

Amazon is unlikely to take BTC for a simple reason.
With credit cards, Amazon knows immediately whether a charge succeeded or not, so orders can be handled mechanically without human attention.
But with BTC payments, the status is not always succeeded or failed. A BTC payment can remain unconfirmed, which is neither succeeded nor failed. So users whose BTC payments don't confirm will contact Amazon customer support, causing higher support costs. Amazon can't tell the user to pay again, because double payments might result if the first payment eventually gets confirmed.

There are several different issues here.
1. I'm sure different ASICs have different internal structures, all kept as trade secrets, that may give a 1% or 2% advantage to one over others. Such hardware differences are normal and expected, and are not an attack. Maybe there's a threshold at which it becomes an attack, and maybe at 50% we have crossed the threshold. But not at 20%. It's just an optimization.
2. If the bitcoin protocol considers empty blocks valid, then they're valid, and generating them is not an attack. The protocol is supposed to impose a cost on all users of the network, and if there is some type of use of the network (e.g., empty blocks) that costs the network more than it costs the user, then the protocol needs to be upgraded.
3. There's also a flaw in the original logic of the document: It's called an attack only if it's covert, even though the patent would still allow a subset of miners to perform the same "attack" overtly. If it's an attack, it's an attack, whether covert or not. 
4. "A proof of work is supposed to prove work" -- no, I disagree. In a POW system, the proof is always of the result, not the actual work that went into achieving the result. The algorithm is supposed to make it hard to reach the result, but each selfish minor is free to get to the result as fast as they can -- that doesn't violate the POW concept. if somebody finds a really good optimization, we might want to upgrade the protocol, but without calling that optimization an attack.
Ultimately, the entire bitcoin system is designed assuming that miners will act in their own selfish interest. This type of selfish behavior is not an attack, it's what makes the network secure. If it doesn't, the protocol should be upgraded, but we should not call mere selfish behavior an attack.
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:08:19

It depends on how literal you want to be.
If you want to be completely literal, then you have to admit that the blockchain has no bitcoins, but merely ones and zeroes that we hash and double-hash and then we calculate unspent outputs, and then we pretend that there are bitcoins there.
But the blockchain is like a disk drive with ones and zeroes. If there are no bitcoins on your disk drive (which might hold a copy of the blockchain) then there are no bitcoins in the blockchain. If there are bitcoins on your disk drive, then how could the same bitcoins also be on all the other disk drives that also hold copies of the blockchain?
I think it's perfectly fine to think of bitcoins as being "in" your wallet. It's just like saying you have $5K USD "in" your bank account, even though your bank account is just a row in some SQL database that holds mostly strings, integers, and fixed-point numbers.

Paper wallets are hard to manage and full of traps and I don't recommend you use them if you are a novice. Sooner or later you will make a mistake and lose bitcoins.
The big problem is that when you transfer $400 from a paper wallet that held $1000, there is no guarantee that $600 still remains there. This is very surprising if you aren't used to how bitcoins work. A paper wallet doesn't necessarily act like a real wallet. Removing $400 from a paper wallet might leave the paper wallet with $0 in it, and the other $600 ends up somewhere else and you might not realize it. And you mislay that "somewhere else" and your $600 is now lost forever.
A good secure device (like a spare Android phone which I recommended earlier), along with backups of your seed, will be much safer in practice.
The only good way of using a paper wallet is to give one as a gift, and then help the recipient move **all** the bitcoins out of the paper wallet into a device as soon as possible.
It's different if you are truly a pro and understand how paper wallets work. But even in that case, you would be better off using one or more hardware wallets, or using multisignature addresses and keeping the keys on multiple devices, in place of using paper wallets.

Imagine that a bitcoin address is like a box that contains bitcoins.
You have a box A containing 10 bitcoins, and from that box you take 2 out and send them to your friend. You would expect 8 bitcoins to remain in box A.
The complication is that some wallet software will take all 10 bitcoins out of box A, send 2 to your friend, then create a **brand new box B** and put the remaining 8 bitcoins in box B.
So now you think box A contains 8 bitcoins, and you don't realize there's a brand new box B in your desk drawer with the 8 bitcoins. You carefully keep box A (which is empty).
Your desk is very old, so you take it to a recycling center, where they melt it down.
You think your 8 bitcoins are safe in box A. But they have been melted along with box B which was inside the desk drawer.
Why do some bitcoin wallets do this? They generate a new bitcoin address every time they send bitcoins, and all the unsent bitcoins go there, to enhance your privacy. Even though all the bitcoin transactions are publicly visible, generating a new so-called "change address" every time helps prevent nosy people from looking at the public blockchain and tracking who owns which bitcoins.
The cost of this privacy is more user confusion.
The new solution to this confusion is deterministic wallets. No matter how many addresses they generate, you only ever need the original seed to recover all your bitcoins. But isolated private keys don't fit in this scheme, which is why you try to get your bitcoins out of any isolated private key (or paper wallet) and into a deterministic wallet as soon as possible.
Once they are in a deterministic wallet, you can recycle your desk safely. It doesn't matter if the bitcoins were in box A or box B. Both boxes can be recreated at any time from your wallet seed, and the bitcoins recovered.

I don't think he actually predicted $2,000. This is the general structure of the quote:
"If &lt;condition&gt; and &lt;condition&gt; then we *could* see Bitcoin easily triple over the next year going from the current $700 level to +$2,100" Jakobsen said. (Emphasis added.)
This is hardly a prediction. It's a wishy-washy weasel-worded if-then statement typical of analysts who don't make verifiable predictions but want to take credit for them anyway.
Such fake predictions are a dime a dozen on numerous websites. A real prediction doesn't begin with "if &lt;condition&gt; and &lt;condition&gt; then..." and does not say something "could" happen, all of which are presumably intended to allow the analyst to hedge his bets so he can never be proven wrong but can often claim to have been right.
Edit: The actual conditions don't matter. What matters is that these conditions are rather vague, so if the fake prediction falls flat on its face, the analyst can claim that the prediction was actually correct but the conditions were not met. And if anybody is able to persuasively argue that the conditions were actually met, then the analyst can use his trump card and say that he never claimed it *would* happen, only that it *could* happen.
Also note that "over the year" makes the prediction come true if the price spikes to $2000 even for a minute during the year.

Here is one strategy.
Get a secondary SIM-less Android phone, running Android 5.x or 6.x. Pick a smaller screen size, and get one used (maybe off Ebay or Craigslist) to keep the price down. It doesn't need to have much memory or disk space. Factory-reset it, do not root it, and enable full-disk encryption if not already active. Set a very long unlock key (e.g., 16-digit PIN), and make sure you set it so it requires the unlock key to start booting.
This secondary Android phone has no SIM. You will only ever use Wi-Fi.
Uninstall or disable all the apps that you don't need to use bitcoins.
Install selected bitcoin wallets. Try Mycelium or Coinomi or both.
Initialize the wallet and save your seed somewhere. Most people recommend a paper copy.
If you have a Chromebook, and ONLY if you have a Chromebook, you can create a free Lastpass account, install the Lastpass extension, and save your seed in a Secure Note within Lastpass. Do not use Lastpass on any other OS to save the seed. And do not use this Lastpass account for managing any non-bitcoin passwords.
Keep most of your bitcoins funds in the wallet on your SIM-less secondary Android phone. Keep this phone powered off.
Since your secondary SIM-less Android phone remains powered off most of the time, if anybody steals it, it will be impossible, or very hard, for them to break into it. You will have time to create a new wallet somewhere else and sweep the bitcoins out of the old wallet.
You will only ever power it up when using your own private Wi-Fi. Never in any public hotspot. Power it up, transfer enough bitcoins from it to your iPhone breadwallet or to any other device for whatever you need to do, then power it down.
About once every couple of weeks, keep this Android phone powered up long enough so it can get any Android updates. **Don't let them autoinstall.** Install updates only after they have been out for a while. This way, if any update turns out to be bad, you will read about it before it gets a chance to infect your phone.

i don't know if you are lying or not. And it doesn't matter. If you are telling the truth, you have provided enough information for somebody to fill in the blanks and replicate your set-up. if you are lying, you have still provided enough ideas for somebody to fill in the blanks and implement your ideas. Either way, we all win. All good ideas are just ideas before they get implemented.
I did, though, notice that there are little pieces of information missing that an average person would have included almost instinctively.
E.g., where you sell the used miners in high volume. (You did reply to my separate inquiry, and you mentioned eBay, but not the eBay store name.)
E.g., what kind of computer hardware drives the miners. Most people will always mention both the mining hardware and the computer(s) that drive it -- just because it's the usual thing to do.
E.g., a photo of a greenhouse from the outside. Not because anybody necessarily needs to see one, but because most people who have accomplished something interesting always like to share a photo of the **whole** thing, not just pieces of it.
E.g., how much overhead there is in replacing the miners every few months. It would be somewhat disruptive for most people to replace their miners and go through software reconfiguration and testing every few months. And the average person would have mentioned how much effort this involves.
I'm not suggesting that these indicate any deceit, but rather, that these omissions are unusual and there's probably a reason for them. It could well be that you simply edited your posting to be more compact and there wasn't enough space for these details.
Edit: Also he stated that he uses D.C. to power the miners, so no inverter is needed. I think it would be hard to get D.C. from the solar panels at the right voltages. There would definitely need to be a step involving conversion to A.C and then back to regulated D.C. Also the computers would almost certainly need multiple voltages, typically 5 V D.C. and 12 V D.C.

Could somebody who does not want to grow lettuce, but only mine bitcoins, do the same thing profitably?
Also, where do you resell the mining hardware? Since you have high volume, presumably you have a regular base of operations, e.g., an Amazon store, or a Ebay store, etc.? It would be great if we could visit it and see what you are selling and at what prices.

There's a simple fact about money-laundering that I think doesn't get enough notice in any debate:
**No money-laundering can occur unless some other crime precedes it.**
All the efforts expended on detecting and stamping out money-laundering (which we know imposes heavy costs on innocent people -- see "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Civil Forfeiture", or "Stop and seize" articles in the Washinton Post, or the article "Taken" in the New Yorker) could be more profitably used to focus on the actual crimes that precede money-lanudering.
We all, including the researchers patticipating in this AMA, should definitely ask: Why such a focus on money-landering, even at such a heavy cost to innocent people?
Stamp out the substantive crime, and you don't need to worry about money-laundering.
It's a simple cost-benefit issue.

According to this article:
the solar array is a 1-megawatt facility constructed for $2.5 million.
It would power 400+ S9 Antminers (if half the power were used for cooling). You could be mining as many as 70 BTC per month. Add a decent amount of organic lettuce and some fish, and you have a pretty good moneymaking facility that should pay back for itself in a year.
Too bad all that power is going towards a golf course and a housing subdivision.

"One will be the bank's coin" is incorrect.

FBI operations are designed to cause crimes to occur that would not have occurred but for FBI actions.
In this particular case, the so-called attempted murders were actively induced and staged by the FBI.
Had the FBI merely observed the operation, instead of actively intervening in it and actually running portions of it, the likely prison sentence would have been just a few years.

That entire paper is suspect. If the authors overlooked such an obvious distinction as minimally-cached local unreliable storage vs heavily-cached cloud-based reliable storage, who knows what else they overlooked?
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:29:37


The examples that the authors have chosen provide reliable storage used in a random access manner. So the service provider must use some type of storage redundancy* and have enough high-speed caching, via SSDs or RAM, to allow fast random access even when the storage device is slow. Therefore prices for online storage include much more than just raw storage.
You should be able to use unreliable non-RAID storage for the blockchain, since lost data can be easily downloaded again. And most of the time your local copy of the blockchain will be sequentially written and infrequently read, so not much caching is needed. Generic discussions of storage costs do not necessarily directly apply to local blockchain storage.
*It's been informally estimated in random places on the Internet that the reliability figures Amazon publishes for S3 storage are consistent with everything being stored on three disks.

BreadWallet is an iPhone app, and I don't use an iPhone, so I can't be sure. The iTunes entry for BreadWallet doesn't say it's a deterministic wallet. It might be.
Blockchain has an Android wallet, ~~but I stay away from it because it requires intrusive permissions (primarily, access to contacts).~~ A bitcoin wallet that needs personal information, such as phone number, list of contacts, email address, etc., is not a proper wallet and should not be used.
A proper bitcoin wallet requires no personal information from you at all. It lets you choose a passphrase, but only to protect your keys. So, to summarize:
**If it requires you to reveal anything about yourself, it's not a proper bitcoin wallet.**
You can find out experimentally if a bitcoin wallet is deterministic or not. Install it afresh on device A and let it create your keys following its default initialization sequence. It should ask you to save a "seed", which is a sequence of 12 or more words.
Send yourself a tiny amount (e.g., 0.1 mBTC) from some other device B into the wallet on device A. Save your seed then delete the wallet app from device A. Reinstall on device A, and initialize with the saved seed. If your 0.1 mBTC magically reappears, you have a deterministic wallet. Otherwise it's not, and you just lost 0.1 mBTC. Maybe you should have sent only 0.01 mBTC.
Please see my suggestions at this link: [d2w5wxa](
(Edited to strike out assertion that the Blockchain wallet requires access to contacts. I was mis-remembering.)

You're forgiven if English is your second language and you haven't yet gained sufficient fluency in idiomatic English. Otherwise:
Stupidest headline I have seen today.
It could have been written as: "Law firm petitions the CFTC to exempt some trades from regulation." Shorter and makes more sense.
If you want people to know about the law firm: "Steptoe and Johnson, a law firm with many Bitcoin clients, petitions the CFTC to exempt some trades from regulation." This is much more informative and more correct than "This law firm just filed".
First, it didn't "just" file -- the petition is dated July 1.
Second, "a law firm", or the specific name of the law firm, is much better English than "this law firm", because you aren't standing there near some building pointing at a sign with the law firm's name.

On the typical computer (Windows or OS X) where the Jaxx desktop app / chrome extension might be used, every application has access to the filesystem. There is no requirement to grant any special privilege.

Chrome sandboxes extensions and apps so they can't access one another's data. So a rogue extension or app won't be able to steal your Jaxx keys. But that's not the problem anyway.
The problem is that every other application outside of Chrome does have full access to every Chrome app's/extension's data. And since malware is easy to get on your home computer, your Jaxx keys are vulnerable.

No asset is or is not a security by itself. It's the situation that makes it a security. Bitcoin cannot by itself be classified as a security, unless you define the situation. The author of that article has failed to make this point.
He cites the Howey test without exhibiting an understanding of it. In that case, land was deemed to be a security under the specific circumstances of that case. That doesn't mean that land is always security.
Don't waste your time on that article or on that blog please. I suggest looking towards the more mainstream publications (WSJ, Reuters, Associated Press, Bloomberg) for better information.

References, please.
Edit: A number of people have provided references, varying in quality from smart (link to EFF) to stupid (mentioning Google). But all of them missed an essential point. I wasn't asking for references for the possibility that you **might** be denied entry. Entry into the US for non-citizens and non-permanent residents is always at the discretion of the people at the border — they are not required to give you a reason for denying you entry. But that wasn't the point.
I was asking for references for the assertion that you **will** be denied entry, because that was the assertion to which I was replying. The person to whom I addressed my request has not responded, which is smart, because there are no references to be found for his/her claim.

Thanks, I appreciate the links.
So I think my point was this:
Let's say you talk on the phone for about 2-3 minutes in a live conversation with somebody who answers the phone. The person at the other end won't write it all down (hardly anybody knows shorthand these days, and I doubt that they will spend the time to play back a recording afterwards) but instead will summarize all the conversation as they remember it in maybe a dozen words.
Wouldn't it be better if you yourself said exactly those dozen words to the person at the other end? Then you don't have to rely on them to get it right.
You can always expand on your summary if requested by the person at the other end.
Not to discount your efforts, but rather, if you want others to use your phone calls as a model, you could make them more brief and precise.
