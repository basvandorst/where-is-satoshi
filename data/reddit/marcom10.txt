And funding I do not believe can be done faster. It all depends on when it gets picked up in the blockchain

That's what Im thinking. And coinbase allows you to get the coins instantly, convert to fiat, and essentially purchase products.
I think it can work better now that its becoming bigger. How did you dropship?

Its almost impossible. I've gone through them all so many times. They either don't accept accounts in the USA or don't have payment options for USA.
The best way I've done it is by signing up on Coinbase.com and transferring BTC from there. 
Hope that helps

How are sales through bitcoin going?

So you shipped to consumer by going to amazon.com and putting the SHIP TO as the buyer? This is exactly what I had in mind to do.
I would charge 20% doing this now and only sell some higher end products $xxx-$xxxx

why no international?

This is interesting..I assume they are dropshipping because I have to connect my coinbase account to fund purchases?

There are no fees today on Coinbase. Even so, there are no fees in excess of $100 (at least to my knowledge) on coinbase.

Hmm but what if the price of BTC falls by the time you convert to fiat? Aren't you losing money?

What's your site? Do you hold inventory or dropship it?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:42:54
That's not a bad idea, what was your markup like?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:54:59
Will show up, give it some time. Keep this in mind if you're trying to day trade as well. Its really easy to lose money if you don't transfer and have some funds ready.
Sorry I'm not too familiar with Cryptsy

Wire transfer? not totally interested in that either. Want something that can do bank or CC but not sure if its possible at this point...
