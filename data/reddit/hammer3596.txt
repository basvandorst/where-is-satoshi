So you dont think that another crypto currency cpuld do a better job. How about the problem that it can get locked to a wallet if a person forgets hes code dies or that trump could bomb korea making the bitcoin go down becouse he would destroy alot of bitcoin holders thereby freezing the bitcoins affected?

I respect your opinion. My question to you is how are you sure that this crypto currency is not way to far ahead of itself. I can deffinitly see how it will change the world but im not sure if this would happen in my life time and im only 21 :) im not bashing cryptos i think its a fantastic idea, but will it be adopted as a legit currency all over the world even though it can be used for money laundering. Will people have enough balls to put there life/money in a currency that is not regulated and ensured by the banks (if you live in a country that has good banking)

My thoughts.
No Inflation.
Good for ppl who are i fleeing from war.
Easy transport
Bitcoin can get stuck in wallets
If the bitcoins does not get distributed somewhat equally it will be worthless. 
Money laundering.
Mad fees for buying bitcoins
Many more effective ways of moving currency
Ill add more when i have the time

My best guess is that they dont buy any bitcoin but they are investing in the bitcoin stock.
To put it in other terms lets say i buy 1g of gold i own that gold. but you could also invest the money in the stock gold, meaning you dont own any gold but just the stock.

Ofc its cfd that does not change the fact that they sell bitcoin as a stock. And when i say stock i mean it as in you buy at the bitcoin price but you dont recive any bitcoin you recive a share much like when you buy gold on the stock market you dont recive gold you have a share of gold. As for the shadyness i would imagine alot of ppl who are complaining about the program becouse they are getting stomped out of postitons is becouse they have no idea on margin and how it affects your stocks.

How so? if i buy the stock i will not get bitcoin i will get a share of the stock i cant buy anything with that like i could if i were to buy the bitcoin and put it in my wallet. Learn your fucking shit before shit posting u ignorant fucktard.
