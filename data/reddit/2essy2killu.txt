Why not put all BTC in the channel and use it in the way on-chain tx is being used now
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:02:18
Still can't really understood on some why(s) after reading the thread, but thanks for the references :)

That's interesting argument that it will free up the blockspace. Although, I am also wondering how much of those tx's in the pool actually will be able to utilize LN. Another thing to consider is whether there is security or centralization issue when a single channel is connecting big enough number of merchants and customers. Otherwise, why not just connect every single node and wallet to an LN channel and basically migrate the entire on-chain to off-chain.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:54:25
But debit card can be used for all, unless the channel is connected to many services / merchants that's used widely it's gonna be even worse than just 1 on-chain tx.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:41:17
So in the future we will have no on-chain txs anymore and migrate everything to off-chain (having all nodes connected to single channel)?

I don't know why people are downvoting you, this just shows how immature people in is. All decentralized currencies are purely market, based on what majority wants, there is no trademark or whatsoever (this is legally enforced, centralized). 
If majority wants to take Bitcoin Cash as the real Bitcoin so be it. If majority wants to take Bitcoin (originally made by Satoshi) as Bitcoin then so be it. Bitcoin after all isn't a brand, it is a definition of the vision of decentralized currency, in which is subjective to each person (trade-offs between "more" centralization and convenience)
It's a beautiful system of democracy, people who think just naming conventions like this will devalue their investments are just petty people who hope stupid money (who can get easily misdirected) to go to where their investments are. Let the stupid money goes where the stupid products are and die together with it later.

Would love to know if there are any LN's developers that would comment on this. From what I understood, if it's possible without compromising security and decentralization having a single channel connected to all nodes, then it might even be better to rebuilt the whole ecosystem from ground up not needing PoW anymore. 
In what cases we still need on-chain tx other than migrating everything to the newly created channel? I think the only risk is if the liquidity providers' count does not have big enough numbers that may halt the entire network. Though I have little to no knowledge about LN's implementation to this level, so can't really comment on this.
In summary, what I understood:
Wallet A, Wallet B, (all claimed wallets), Wallet Z do single transaction to move BTC to the main (single) LN channel. Then all txs only happened inside the channel and the main BTC chain only produces blocks with empty txs.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:40:23
Yes, like I said unless the channel is connected to wide range of merchants then it's not gonna be practical. It's as good as buying gift card (well the value is still tied to BTC in this case) if it's only single_merchant to single_customer channel.

What prevents Bcash from applying what is applied on Bitcoin later?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:18:10
Isn't that how business work though, they try to make profit somewhere. Another way thinking of it might be that calculating the miners' fee isn't trivial to be implemented especially for such big business with huge amount of money on the line. With batch txs, they have different bytes used and perhaps they don't have the resources or think it's not worth it to make a mechanism to calculate the exact fees being used, even other exchanges do this too. They would rather charge more than charge less and lost some money.
LN isn't even live yet... And even if it does, afaik it's a payment channel, such that if you want to move the money to an address not included in the channel, then again it can't be done through LN.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:32:31
It probably will not, LN works similar to PayPal's balance. You have to top up the channel you opened with certain address, which requires an on-chain tx. Though if you often have payment back and forth to this channel, it can be beneficial.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:36:32
It's conspiracy at best, maybe it's more because implementing things take time and money. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:39:08
Wait until get confirmed or double spend it.

A stupid decision is a stupid decision, doesn't matter if you win from it, it is still a stupid decision. Even though you believe in the long term of BTC, what about the year long bear market. He would be massively damaged if that was the case.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:39:06
or maybe hold til the point it is widely adopted as payment option.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:13:03
That's cheap compared to most other exchanges that charges 0.001~0.002 BTC (Bittrex, Cryptopia, Coinexchange, etc.)
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:48:51
How so? If you see BTC chart in the past, there are instances where BTC goes down as much as 90% and takes quite some time before recovering. That could happen anytime, not denying that BTC could shoot up to $100k anytime too. If BTC goes down like that after the guy take the loan and put it to BTC would you classify it as stupid decision? A decision shouldn't be said as correct or wrong based on the outcome but rather the idea behind it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:18:04
That and the confirmation time, unless the merchant want to take the risk of accepting 0-confirmation payments.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:58:38
To be fair he said "In my point of view..."
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:12:22
The network should run seamlessly whether or not there are attackers.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:09:04
I only agree it is not stupid if it's backed up with depth analysis and huge dataset that result on safe enough probability. It probably is easier to make a guess on BTC going up in the next year (long term) rather than in next month (short term). 
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:57:28
It's called fund management, just because I believe in bitcoin doesn't mean I should put all my fiat to Bitcoin or sell my house for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:13:22
Clue on the word "loan"
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:30:25
Okay, I am referring to transactions ranging from 1~50$ for daily consumptions, i.e.: Supermarket, Restaurants
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:12:10
or just double spent it...
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:59:29
PM me link too pls!
@_date: 2017-09-05 14:29:27
I don't see it being used much as micropayments now. Perhaps to buy the currency with BTC makes more sense.
@_date: 2018-04-04 06:17:40
I can kinda understand how he feels. He poured hours, days, months, years working and learning the low level mechanism on many things on Blockchain then some guys just blabbered nonsense on a supposedly intellectual "conference".
