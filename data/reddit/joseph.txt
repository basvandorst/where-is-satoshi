I didn't say anything about Cryptsy support, but here is what happened. In addition to Cryptsy, Big Vern also runs a bunch of mining pools, one of which was called mincoinpool.com. I mined there for a while, and one day when I went to log in to pay out my coins (I really should have used auto payouts), it redirected me to a site called alternatepool.com. Well, this new site has no login, so my coins were now gone. I had never received any notification that this was going to happen. I tried contacting him through multiple channels, including Cryptsy support, but never got any response regarding this issue. I will add that Cryptsy support did write back, but they were not even responding about what I had written, rather they said something to the effect "we're working hard to get this issue resolved for everyone", so my problem was assumed to be a part of some mass issue that was plaguing Cryptsy at the time. I wrote back clearly stating the problem but they did not reply. So, I'm definitely not a fan of Big Vern or Cryptsy or any of his pools. I won't go as far as to say he is stealing coins but it is unethical to make a site of that nature disappear without notice and then fail to provide any support. Beware, that's all.

Big_Vern made my mincoins disappear and would not respond to my attempts to contact him. Classy.... I guess.

They are talking about [M-Pesa]( which existed years before bitcoin. M-Pesa succeeded because of a lot of investment by [Safaricom]( who placed agents all over Kenya who can convert cash to and from digital currency.  40,000 such agents exist, according to [this]( and you will find them even in remote villages.
