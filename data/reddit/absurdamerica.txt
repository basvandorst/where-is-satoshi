Very unpopular wars NOW. 10 years later. Afghanistan had very high levels of public support initially. Iraq less so and obviously the popular support was based on bullshit intelligence but the idea that the government went against the will of the people is rather thin IMO.

Again, **none of that** is in any way an analogue for bitcoin and traditional money.

It's more enhanced than totally disrupted those things, and the benefits to its enhancements are inarguable.

I would agree they haven't changed enough, but to suggest that we're literally going to do the exact same thing over again is a stretch. There are already rules in place preventing companies that engage in consumer banking from having the same company engage in MBS and derivatives investing, for example. Could those divisions fail?

The evangelists will tell you companies are "banning" the use of bitcoin because they're scared of bitcoin's ability to be a "game changer" in terms of payment technology.
Really those companies (mostly banks) are just insulating themselves from the headaches of dealing with customers who transfer and then lose large sums of money speculating on bitcoin.
It's just like even before there were laws against Internet gambling in the United States most credit card companies would prevent you from transferring large sums to online gambling sites.

Third, we had no national highway system in 1913, no safety standards, and we had one car per every 86 people in 1913 but more like 1 car for every 1 person today, not to mention 3 times more people than we did in 1913.

The size of a given market changes how vulnerable to manipulation it is in a huge way.

When someone runs off with my dollars I don't need to spend an hour explaining to the police what a dollar is, what I can do with it, and why they should be concerned I've been ripped off.

It looks and behaves way more like a stock than a currency.
Hell, at certain corporations you used to be able to "spend stock" to buy your lunch back in the day. 


You're so blinded by your own emotionally invested view that you see "bitcoin" as an entity. Tell the people that bought 3 days ago and lost thousands that it's just a setback or a hiccup. Obviously, buyer beware, you take risk and you pay a price, but the only reason anybody would invest in bitcoin is on principle or out of speculation.


If bitcoin had lots of real promise you don't think there'd be hundreds of institutional investors looking to get in on the ground floor by running a scalable and professional exchange? 
Hell, even a group like the Gates Foundation could instantly provide support to it if it really was half of what its believers think it is.

Sort of? The key difference is most people didn't have an alternative to the dollar. I'm judging bitcoin as an alternative to other forms of stable currency, and why shouldn't I?
The dollar during the great depression was being harmed by a huge systemic economic problem. Bitcoin is being harmed by no such unavoidable environment so why wouldn't I choose the stable alternative?


Again, I judge and expect different things from a company value (equity) and a currency.

0 of whom I trust.


Perhaps nothing, but my credit card company insures me against things like identity theft and fraudulent use of my money, as does my bank.

This isn't on topic so much, but am I the only one who sees the similarity between the end game of extreme Capitalism being very similar to the end game of Communism?
The end result is ghost towns, empty buildings, with the average person having very little but a few at the top being very wealthy. Sure, I think Capitalism is less susceptible to totalitarianism, and I think the group of people who "have things" is bigger in Capitalism than with Communism, but if you squint, they both look very similar.

Right, but an efficient exchange would support bitcoin well, causing more adoption, causing a huge increase in transaction volume, causing more commissions.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:22:21
I meant with bitcoin. You're suggesting you would have no recourse with Paypal when you have no recourse now without them if there's any disagreement about a transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:49
To prevent early adopters from gaining exponentially from their "investment" and to give the currency stability and legitimacy from the start.
Hell, blizzard already accepts cash for "Diablo gold" but Paypal is in the middle of that.

Nobody takes bitcoin because it's volatile and it's volatile because nobody takes it.
It's also really hard to tease out how many users are actually paying for goods and services and not just trading coins back and forth. I could write a script that would transfer coins between two wallets over and over and massively increase the supposed "volume" of bitcoins on any given day.

I disagree entirely. That's the primary problem with a gold backed security. Why would I spend it if I view it primarily as an actual value store, something to hold onto to increase my net worth innately?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:53:44
Actually it's the perfect timeframe to use. If bitcoin was being marketed as an equity or a commodity it would be silly of me, but it's not. It's being marketed as a currency I should use to purchase things.

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:12:58


The reason bitcoin is volatile is people are hopping on and off the gravy train. If the vast majority of bitcoin use was for purchasing goods and services rather than speculation you wouldn't see the kind of fluctuations you're seeing. 
This won't change until a major retailer chooses to cut out the middle man, but a major retailer won't risk adopting such a volatile "currency".
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:33:02
So what's it an asset based on? The gullibility of other people who think it makes a good currency?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:25
No, the reason "trading with other currencies doesn't seem to effect us in day to day life" is because the currency isn't fluctuating in value 500 percent in a **week**.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:51:21


The volatility inherent in a commodity makes it untenable as a currency. That's why we bailed on the gold standard and why the volatility will never allow bitcoin to become widely accepted as a currency. 
You're trying to use a screwdriver as both a hammer and a screwdriver. If you try hard enough you can make it kind of work, for a while, but on the long term we have multiple tools for a reason.

Really? Gold's dropping because of bitcoin??
Gold is dropping because all indications are that the Fed is going to stop QE as the economy strengthens. This means the market will be growing more confident and gold will no longer be seen as the best place to put your money.
The fact that you actually think bitcoin is moving the value of gold is very amusing.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:29:27
I don't think you are understanding. They already accept multiple forms of currency, some of which make them more money than others.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:53:49
Hardly. If bitcoin is truly better, it will continue to grow and there will be a point where it is stable enough to be used as actual currency and there will be benefits for both buyers and sellers to use it.
As it stands, I see that there are probably 10 different ways I can lose my money, get ripped off, or have an awful experience that would prevent me from ever wanting to use it over paper money.

That's the problem with deflation, it's very very hard to get out from under once it sets in. Inflation while not great, is far more manageable and susceptible to various interventions.

It's pointless to compare percentages of bitcoins versus percentage of American net worth.
The total wealth of the United States is around 120 **trillion** dollars.
4 percent of that is 4.8 **trillion** dollars
There are 12 million outstanding bitcoins. 21 percent of 12 million is 2,520,000 x 1200 = 3,024,000,000 or 3 billion dollars.
Absurd comparison.

If bitcoin was going to be a success you'd see literally hundreds of investors injecting cash into the exchanges to make them stable, there'd be tons of money to be made in the process.

So in other words, if bitcoin succeeds it will have succeeded.


People won't use it for general day to day commerce because it is volatile, and it's volatile because people don't use it for general day to day commerce. 
Chicken and the egg scenario.

You're suggesting those people are necessarily smart. Follow the money. If bitcoin has a promising future you'd see hundreds of millions worth of venture capital pouring in to set up exchanges and infrastructure, but that isn't happening.
What further complicates this whole thing is most of those "brave" vendors are immediately cashing out to dollars anyway. They aren't doing business in bitcoin.

Oh really? Tell that to people holding gold who lost 70 dollars an ounce in value over the last few days.


Not once you factor in volatility. It's like me raising prices by 30 percent and giving you a 3 percent off coupon.


A court can simply compel you to convert your bitcoin for cash. You're kidding yourself.


Bitcoin is deflationary. Dollars are inflationary. You have no clue what you're talking about do you?


13.5 percent of Africa has Internet access.
I can't even type anymore, you're just wrong.

In my experience, if it's with the same bank, it almost always is, automatically.


Cool, while we're changing the subject, did you know that I recently went to the zoo? There were tigers there!


No, they exist largely due to the complexity of taxes. If I pay zero taxes I need no help from an accountant. If I have zero bank accounts but pay taxes I'll probably need an accountant.

My guess is his Chinese is way better than yours, even if his English isn't.

We already aren't and it has nothing to do with bitcoin. Nobody carries cash anymore, it's all just ones and zeros. "All that stress" wasn't caused by the dollar, the inflationary nature of the dollar is what kept "all that stress" from exploding into a worldwide financial collapse.
Until you can explain how bubbles like the housing bubble can't happen with Bitcoin or when they do happen how Bitcoin will help recover from them faster you're just blowing smoke OP.

Bitcoin is volatile because nobody accepts it, nobody accepts bitcoin because it is volatile.

You got lucky. 
 
The fact that you're running from fiat to the "security" of a totally unregulated digital experiment which has been seeing 200 percent value fluctuations every day and has been effectively rendered impotent several times in the last month is nothing short of crazy.
I wish you luck.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:21:23
Whether or not bitcoin went up or down they were being idiots.
It's like spending an significant amount of your cash flow on lottery tickets, even if you get lucky and win, you still were basically just flipping a coin.

Which is why I can get a discount if I pay cash right? Right?
Oh right...

Perhaps the fact that Cypress has a GDP 28,000 times smaller than the United States might have something to do with that?

Need is the wrong word, but my point is that someone who invests for a living is fundamentally different from an Average Joe.
Mark Cuban can afford to diversify less as it's his job to know a given industry and "bet smart". 
Your average investor? No way.

That doesn't change the fact that when they were the dominant technology, they were subpar even then.

They have every reason to have a stable trading platform, it's in their long term best interest. It's almost as if they're behaving like bitcoin is a fad.

Betamax was objectively better than VHS, HD-DVD was objectively better than Blu-Ray.

What evidence do you have that most people aren't speculating?

Sweet, I saved 5 percent but by the time my transaction cleared my payment is worth 30 percent less than when I sold my product.
Seems like a real benefit for sure.

If you think you can predict the market you should be able to retire with the money made by using your own predictions.

So what BoA is saying is if bitcoin makes it big, it's worth 1300 dollars a coin, which is actually saying that right now bitcoin is massively overvalued.
This is not good news.

If we're talking about formerly worthless money, I'll take any spare Continentals off your hands. I've been looking to retire early.

You can, but you're being inconsistent and BTC isn't supposed to be an "asset", it's supposed to be a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:14:20
It's been going on for years.

Posts I see daily on "OMG my money didn't show up in my account"
"I can't get my money out of my account"
"My money took X hours to transfer"
"My purchase took X hours to transfer and I paid more for my BTC than I intended to"
"&lt;insert site name here&gt; is down, what do I do?"
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:05:49
A 200 percent price fluctuation over 12 hours is not "stable".
Hell, Apple is considered a volatile stock and it has only seen a 170 percent fluctuation over the last 6 **months**
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:07:30
You're missing the point though. I don't really want to use bitcoin that badly. Most other people don't either. It needs to be a "no brainer" before your average customer will use it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:53:29
Can I have yours?
