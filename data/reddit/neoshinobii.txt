10 bitcoins??

Snarky response then nonsensical rhetoric. Let me guess...Jordan Peterson fan?
If BTC costs so much to transfer that it's cheaper to sell on an exchange then use western union then it's not working properly and people won't use it for anything other than to hold as an asset. 
Which does then just make it revolutionary for elites. It should empower the poor, not the rich.
Edit: just adding that I'm not anti BTC, I'd love for it to work, but I don't see it right now.

Lol you need to build a node to get it to work. Real mainstream bro
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:57:22
Yeah but that doesn't fix the fact BTC is fundamentally flawed now.

Yeah it's just an engineered coup attempt. Stop falling for the shit the US has pulled time and time again.
They engineer unrest, organize a protest, declare a new leader, take over the central bank, start giving out business loans to the locals, raise the interest rate so it's unpayable. Then take all their landholdings as repayment. Same thing as most.other countries they show up in.
And I'm not a maduro fan, but I wasn't a Saddam or ghadaffi fan either and the US involvement decimated those countries.

Was reading from someone on twitter yesterday that they want BTC to average $100 in fees per transaction. 
When did it turn from costless electronic cash used to empower developing countries into a money laundering system for the elites? And how did we let this happen??
