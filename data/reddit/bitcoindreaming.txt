Are the fees that high?  That's insane if true.

Actually, it was an historic event, it was the first real world purchase with Bitcoin, well sort of ...  he paid 10,000 BTC to a guy in the UK who paid for his pizzas with his credit card.  Still, trail blazing and pioneering.  This transaction opened the flood gates.

OK, thank you, will look into it.  I was trying to avoid real estate agents and their usual circus.

That's a real tough list to search - I clicked "load more comments" about 30 times and still never got to the end.  They should have a "load all comments" button to save time and hassle.

Sounds great! How did you advertise your car for sale?  Here on Reddit? I want to join the Bitcoin revolution and am very seriously thinking of selling my motel for Bitcoin. Am I allow to create a new thread here in r/Bitcoin? Is there a place where I can list my motel for sale in Bitcoin? Sorry for dumb questions. Hope someone can help me get started.

Don't worry about it - things are getting better all the time.  Apps, wallets, etc will improve all the time.
It's like email in the early 1990's was, when you had to UUE encode / decode all email attachments.  And then all of a sudden you could just drag and drop and click send.

Woody1992 says merchant fees are 30% - is this true ?
Are there other fees ?  When you convert BTC to fiat ?  Is a physical terminal needed ?  Are there fees / rental for this ?  Anything else ?  Always best to be honest and open and up front about fees, etc.

I'm interested, and run a motel based in on the Central Queensland.  How far north do you go to setup merchants ?  What are the merchant fees ?  Is there a monthly rental on a Bitcoin terminal - or is it all done on-line on a pc ?  Is it Bitcoin only ?  What about other cryptos ?  Can we keep all Bitcoin (or other crypto) payments we receive in Bitcoin (or other crypto) ?  Or do they have to be transferred to fiat ?  Any useful information you can provide ?
