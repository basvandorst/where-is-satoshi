The way OP worded the title, it sounded like he didn't purchase, but "acquired" the BTC in some way other than buying them. Confused me for a few seconds too.

I've been involved for years, i've just kept my BTC on coinbase/online wallets. I used Bitcoin Core back when I had a desktop and it seemed to take only an hour for Core to setup, on my laptop its been days. Are those lightweight wallets secure, Do you recommend them? I really was liking Armory and it's paper backup feature.
edit: thanks for the response btw :D

I bought bitcoin back when when i was in high school for cheap, just to check it out. Spent a good amount of my own money on it. Friend convinced me to sell it around $1100/bitcoin and I did. Gave me a good chunk of change to help out as a student. If anything, Bitcoin is a very easy way for people with not a lot of disposable income to invest into something.
