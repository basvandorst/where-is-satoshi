Thank you for your feedback! We will release a new post when the first back-end proof of concept code is finished. We'd be honored if you might be participating in the GUI version 0.00. We plan to use JSON to port from back to front-end as long as the features and data are clearly arrangable.

I am thrilled about your creation.  
Constructive ciritc/question: Is it safe versus such an attack?

"We", as partially stated, are three tech students of computer science, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Maths and code are our friends. Visual appearance regarding GUIs not too much to be fair.  
  
Thank you for reaching out at first. Right now we are working in between exams on the first back-end prototype and will publish the code in a fresh repository asap and let r/bitcoin know. Because the Bitcoin community is in our opinion the most interested community regarding  technology, we stay here to gain traction with good people and grow roots for the long term of the project.  
  
Together with the repository release, we'll as well open a Discord channel for meetups and discussing the code base as well as future features and resulting PRs. Issue and project tracking is known to us as well as agile software development in the real world. Hence, we'd like to integrate at least the prior two into the repository coding culture.  
  
 We'd be very happy to welcome you as one of our first fellow.
