Windows doesn't come with Flash and Java by default. The people selling them might preinstall it though.

Can confirm, but people are having trouble double clicking to run it. Just do ./bitcoin-qt in terminal if you are having problems.
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:06:11
@_date: 2014-12-06 21:12:10
Wait so you mean its hard to buy bitcoins in murica? But you guys have like coin base, circle etc. and no stupid taxes on BTC. You have it easy !!!
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:22:19
Very nice! Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:16:43
Could you please add some exchanges outside the US/Europe/China aswell? Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-22 23:11:51
You can't really force people to understand something they are not comfortable with. I would recommend to leave the discount for people that are interested, but leave PayPal as an acceptable payment for those without bitcoin.

How do u get a nice info page like that?

*cough* GST in Australia *cough*
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:58:17
Alright I'm getting confirmations now. However it still takes longer for confirmation without a fee, even if the above conditions are met. I seemed to fit the above conditions well. Thanks for the answer, I guess bitcoin core allows sending no fee transaction in some cases after all.
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:34:03
Just like people try accessing /admin.php and hope it works.
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:52:23
Will try to spread to other subreddits ;)
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:50:33
The fee is about 3 cents isn't it??
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:55:34
Bitcoin survived things MUCH worse

Can someone explain why all the upvoted replies are now ridiculously downvoted and the ones which were downvoted are now ridiculously upvoted??
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:42:48
I was in the same situation as you. You have a few choices:
Localbitcoins, which will cost about as much as coin jar with GST.
Btcmarkets.net OR independent reserve: they don't trade Bit coins in their own right, they are just a marketplace. So they only charge GST on the tiny fees. 
Try to sign up for an exchange outside Australia like ANX
There are a few other methods, but these are the main convenient ones. 
Disclaimer: I have only personally used independent reserve (I'm new :p)
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:33:54
Or no. It is easy to miscount the zeroes in 0.00000001 BTC

If it is legally available for free, it's not pirating, it's torrenting.

Truecrypt devs mysteriously stopped working on it. I wouldn't use it.
Also you can get Electrum straight from the website (latest version) verify the PGP key and install it via pip. Don't have the fingerprint of ThomasV on me right now but you should be able to find it. Unless if you specifically say you trust the key, you will get a small harmless error saying "The key might not belong to this person". However as long as you get "good signature from ThomasV" then you should be fine unless if someone is targeting you in a MITM of course.
@_date: 2014-11-08 22:44:46
They can. The Windows viruses can't, but [there are certainly a few](
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:35:29
Yeah I know it is possible to send no fees, however I wasn't aware the standard Bitcoin Core wallet allowed you to do that without any direct modifications. 
I'm not really worried about my transaction no getting confirmed for a while (I'm not in a rush, I can wait a week+ if I have to, as long as it gets confirmed this year ;) ).
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:20:13
Superb!  tells me only port 8333 is detected! I believe its because of the UPnP map port feature in Bitcoin Core (still passed UPnP exposure test on ShieldsUP). PS I'm saying this for information purposes, I'm not a security professional and allgoodthings1 may be correct.
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:53:21
Nah GPG is still fine. Otherwise a lot of open source projects would be really screwed.
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:45:08
That's what I'm trying to explain here:

404 error. Is that the joke?

Mining is really not a good way to make BTC unless if you invest a lot in the hardware.
@_date: 2014-10-22 06:57:47

In Australia we have tap to pay for anything under 100 AUD.

This is actually very clever.
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:55:50
Be skeptical about people confirming addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:12:23
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:02:43
Yeah the conversion to USD is their biggest disadvantage for Aussies, but it lets people from other countries join in so the price will hopefully be lower rather than higher ;)
@_date: 2014-11-01 03:01:03
To clarify: MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE is the minimum fee for standard nodes to relay the transactions (so the world knows the money is spent). The standard client still wants a 0.0001 BTC fee for actually spending.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:51:57
*sigh* another misinformed article...

Yup. News headlines love to provide false information.

The adblocker was the issue! I never thought Adblock Plus would stuff up the CSS so much, and there really is no annoying ads on the page at all. Huh. Submitted a false positive report.
Thanks! Here's 10 bits, all I have on me via @_date: 2014-11-05 21:13:57
I suggest you guys add yourself to the  website so more newbies can reach you ;)

In the cloud? Hope it's encrypted ;)
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:42:12
Maybe its not vulnerable yet, but if a vulnerability is discovered you will probably be on your own. Just don't use deprecated technology.

I remember hearing CBA was very bitcoin unfriendly and blocked bitstamp.

A new update to the node software that forces light clients to pay a small fee.
PS This is not my idea I heard it somewhere before.
@_date: 2014-05-10 01:19:59
I haven't opened port 8333 and  says the node exists.

People here don't seem to understand:

No PIN? Sorry I'm just getting started with bitcoin mobile apps. No protection for a bitcoin app is pretty silly, especially because ITS A PHONE. Why didn't the dev include it? For now Mycelium clearly seems like a better option, even if not fully FOSS.

Defeats the point of cold storage.

Maybe people will find it cheaper to get started?
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:48:31
What wallet would you recommend for sweeping using the private key?
@_date: 2015-01-12 21:46:30
AFAIK this is reinventing the wheel, but basing it off bitcoin. Decentralized anonymous networks already exist with a few years of development (but mostly a lack of content) such as I2P (especially with Tahoe-LAFS) and Freenet who are meant to be independent decentralized networks
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:12:12
If so, maybe we can get a fork :P
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:00:27
I'm not sure if your statement is correct (if you are referring to full nodes).
However the size of this ZeroNet is considerably smaller than other decentralized networks (which is what I was referring to).
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:46:22
Any news?
@_date: 2015-01-08 06:11:08
It's a shame that such a great wallet has a pretty pathetic "open" license just for the sake of being able to say it is "open" when it truly isn't.

People are downvoting a tip (which is actually worth a few cents too). What this sub has become...

It's certainly good for buyers.

Yeah the US will drive the price down. (gotta buy moar)
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:21:27
Uh, it's a ledger, you don't really "own" it ever ;)
@_date: 2014-10-27 08:19:52
Probably more luck rather than skill.
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:51:01
It can't be distributed legally by anyone else other than the devs. That's what makes it a silly "open source" license :/
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:02:19
If I'm long term HODLing, I believe blockchain.info would be a bad choice because the BTC could be worth quite a bit, while armory would be inconvenient because it requires downloading the whole blockchain. Any light wallets that can sweep private keys that are safe and reliable?

If one of your family members turns evil, they won't be able to get your coins if you use Shamir's Secret Sharing correctly. You would need a majority of your family to turn against you to have your coins stolen.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:10:41
Yeah, mobile apps have the most generic names (like "Barcode Scanner")
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:01:43
By joke I was referring to troll-like joking.
I didn't say these were cheap coins, I said we will have cheap coins soon. I was just making a statement that the price is extremely unlikely to go below one cent, I'm not predicting it will fall to one cent.
You decide if you want to sell or buy, I'm not going to decide for you.

Independent Reserve is nice, no GST (because open market) and pretty low price (because open market). There is of course a fee, but it is pretty small.

That is why Mycelium should become FOSS and be on F-Droid.
