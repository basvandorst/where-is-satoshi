I think in the short term the ETF may have an impact, but if it gets denied it won't cause a crash like MT.Gox did. The trend has been upward log-scale growth over time.

Discussion moderators that are biased towards one viewpoint is unfair. It misrepresents a large number of Bitcoin users, business and mining interests. It paints a false picture of what Bitcoin is.
With your analogy of the "moderators" holding the mic, then they've only been handing the mic to posts that are:
1) Pro-Segwit push/adoption
2) Personal and public attacks on people who disagree with core developers
3) Chinese-miners are bad (even though mining is more centralized than ever)
4) Bitcoin pump articles
All other voices promoting other BIPs or blocksize increase proposals they disagree with are silenced. That's not Bitcoin.

I think the departing of a very polarizing figure is great for Bitcoin. Markets up as a result. This is great news!

I believe that Gavin Andresen did the majority of improvements after Satoshi disappeared and left him in power of the BitcoinCore repository. Gavin made Bitcoin what it is right now before leaving it under the control of Wladimir. Under the current leadership many believe that Bitcoin has stagnated for two years.

This isn't too bad, but if transaction costs continue to rise at the pace they have been then making $10-20 Bitcoin transactions could become overly expensive within months.
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:34:15
The problem is that LN shifts money from the miners who secure the network to LN hubs that don't support the network.
Miners won't be profitable when the block reward continues to drop without an equal rise in on-chain transaction fees. 
On-chain transactions must grow because there is a limit to how high of a fee Bitcoin users will tolerate. Some have said that transactions will go to $100 per transaction, but that is not realistic, people will just decide to use something else long before that point, rendering Bitcoin stagnant.
There are also control issues with LN when it's too expensive to settle on-chain.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:24:37


But this also means that they will be too small to settle if there is a Lightning dispute. 


Only if they settle. If on-chain blocks are full that won't be possible. Further, if LN-only blockspace is "reserved" as some have suggested, that will quickly fill up with the current on-chain capacity limitations. The LN at scale will not be able to settle with Segwit sized capacity. We need an adaptive blocksize that doesn't move us backwards before moving us forwards.
It's always been clear that the LN would be good for micro-transactions. It can't really be considered a "scaling" solution for everyday amounts, unless users are willing to put those amounts in jeopardy of being lost. With "LN scaling" you will have very small transactions off-chain, very large transactions on-chain and while everyday $10 to ~$400 transactions with extremely exorbitant and unreasonable transaction costs will get pushed out. 
Further, I would argue that most user transactions are in that $10-$400 value range, which is why people are upset. You're pushing away Bitcoin's  user base by not supporting on-chain as long as is technically possible. 
Last, Rusty, I just wanted to add a thanks for all of your great development work on Bitcoin and Linux. I watched your TedX and enjoyed it. You're a really great ambassador for Bitcoin.

Actually, LukeJR is on the Blockstream payroll. Pretty sure that's a fact. 
Where are you getting your pseudo-facts from? /lol
@_date: 2017-01-28 20:57:44
1MB blocks are easy for current full-nodes to validate without any issues. My machine processes between 1-3 per second. To say that nodes are having trouble with 1MB is just plain and simply not true. In the meantime the network can easily handle many times this amount and that is why users, miners and businesses are requesting a hard-fork to a larger max-blocksize (or a dynamic one).
What I said was true: there is absolutely no good reason at the moment to go from a 1mb block to a 300kb block when the network has the opposite problem, blocks are not large enough.
When you look at the responses to LukeJr's BIP to decrease the blocksize it is clear that most people are against that idea. Yet, LukeJR represents BitcoinCore as one of their main developers.
The change down to 300kb is so absurd that people thought he was either trolling or kidding at first, but actually this is really what he believes. I can link you to the thread if you would like.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:58:46
Miners support the network first and foremost. They wouldn't undermine their own investments by making the network unusable. Your logic doesn't hold.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:53:11
There is a simple solution to this which other clients have implemented that broadcasts headers first. This gives miners ~10 mins to download and validate blocks - no FIBRE required.
Reducing the blocksize is a horrible idea. In fact the only good idea is to dynamically increase it over time.
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:05:24
You're just being childish now because you took something, over-wrote it and then claimed that I was the author of the original, which isn't the case. It's misattribution and meant to deceive.
Bitcoin company != Bitcoin. Agreed. However, if a Bitcoin company pays the salary of 4-6 of the top BitcoinCore developers that company is said to have influence over those developers, no matter how unbiased they may appear or claim to be.
There's a great quote by Upton Sinclair -

His "everyone" is himself and LukeJR. 75% of the network (users, people running full nodes, miners and businesses) think we need larger blocks 6 months ago.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:50:44
Yes, and 23% are running the newest version of core and the remaining ~60% haven't upgraded because they disagree with Core's Segwit-only path. Some are considering switching.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:49:20
From a name like "throwaway36256" I didn't expect much more.


This is a straight lie. They are signaling for anywhere between 2mb-8mb and this is why f2Pool and AntPool haven't adopted Segwit. That is an objective fact. Sorry you're spending your time building throw-away accounts and trolling people posting the truth.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:07:02


It's fast: months rather than years. The process should have been started 6 months ago. A huge amount of testing has already occurred and 20% of the network backs that up. Further, other implementations have decreased the orphan rates of miners, which means more $$ for the ones that switch. Money has a way of moving people to act.


I agree - there are many that disagree but it's possible that a majority will agree very soon.


It's not a credible threat anymore. Can you point me somewhere that explains how it is, and I'll read it. Thanks
Either way, I'm glad you're running a full node - a lot of people don't and it's important for the network even if we disagree. Vote with your feet.

The difference is that yours is something you just changed and threw up there as fake info. He has been paid by Blockstream. That is a fact. Maybe he calls himself an independent contractor, but the money comes from Blockstream. 
You're saying or trying to say that Blockstream has never paid LukeJR in any way? Is that what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:47:02
After Blockstream's CEO, Adam Back went to China to have a meeting with miners he told them that he represented BitcoinCore. They agreed to implement a 2mb hard-fork alongside Segwit. The person he (or someone) decided would handle it was LukeJR. Two people wouldn't work on the same thing at the same time. It was well known that he was "in charge" of writing the code for it. It's not a false statement at all, it's a factual objective observation of what has taken place.

The 'other sub' started because posts here were being deleted. Bitcoin isn't freedom unless it can be discussed.
Every item in your list is hypocritical because it is exactly the thing that happens on this sub.


Basically anyone that opposes Segwit here is attacked personally. I've seen this so so so many times.
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:19:18


I wonder why your companies CEO flew over there then and did a QA afterward, and I won't speculate why. They clearly thought he had power over some of the core developers. To be honest, I don't care but rewriting history is dangerous. To deny that it even took place is kind of silly.


Very close to doxing there. If they exist, I'll remain anonymous on any other account. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:40:56


The difference is time. The time it will take to get people to run Segwit in order for the network to realize its proposed benefits would be a year to two years, and this is unlikely to happen. It will take time for blockchain explorers and wallets to update their code as well. Sure some of them will more quickly, but others will lag. As a result, even on a sliding scale you're not going to see the kind of scaling we need quick enough with Segwit.


It's a command-line parameter. Not just miners but every full node should have the ability to set what they think the max-blocksize should be - since they are the ones doing the work they should have a say as to how much "work" they want to do. In my opinion, it shouldn't be a centrally-planned developer magic number. By the way, that magical number of 1MB was put in place to prevent an attack vector that no longer exists.
Luckily, many other experts (developers) that have contributed to BitcoinCore in the past agree. So with your analogy, the doctors are indeed the ones performing the operation. Some disagree also, but it's up to the network and people running full nodes to decide. If you have a strong opinion, I suggest you run a full node.
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:12:56
It's a true history of events, and I don't know why it bothers you so much that it happened. Nothing was cherry picked. It's just how it happened. Facts. Here are the results of that roundtable agreement led by Adam Back.
Here is a QA with Adam Back afterwards:

Uh, no. I didn't.


Blockstream is a Bitcoin company. Also: water is wet.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:46:07
Bitcoin is still small. At this point, those people you're calling **freeriders** are what gives Bitcoin it's value (demand, people using it vs a different cryptocurrency).
I run a full node, but not everyone will - and that's just fine. Plus, they all paid transaction fees to use the network. I think a dynamic balance between blocksize/fees would be best to make sure miners are compensated once the block reward diminishes while also keeping unconfirmed transaction numbers down.
Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:29:11


This is repeated so much that it sounds like a broken record. Segwit is not a max-blocksize value increase - that's what the miners wanted. A hard-fork that increases the constant value of the max-blocksize. Segwit increases the "total size of the block" but not the const value. 
The problem with Segwit's "size increase" is that it relies on 95-100% of the network adopting Segwit, which will not take place for years if adopted. This is too slow of an increase, which is why miners wanted the constant value increased. 
It also looks like Segwit won't be adopted at all anyway, as support for Segwit is at an all-time low. It was 26% and went down to 23% and headed lower. Basically, the majority of people don't want Segwit.


Actually, they don't - support for BitcoinCore is at an all-time low. 20 percent of the mining network isn't even running their code anymore, and that number is increasing every day.


Yes, they have. They "signal" for larger blocks every time they find a block. That expresses their desire. In fact 75% of the mining network is signaling for max-blocksize constant increase to help facilitate Bitcoin adoption growth.
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:03:11


LukeJR is one of BitcoinCore's main developers. He is paid by Blockstream to contribute to BitcoinCore. He was put in charge of the 2MB hard fork code for BitcoinCore - and he just did it in a way that decreases the blocksize instead of increasing it, taking 5 steps backward.
In fact, under his proposal Blocks would not even reach 1mb again until 2024, six years from now. Yet - BitcoinCore still has him in charge of writing the code for this when the community clearly wants something different.
He very strongly represents BitcoinCore's philosophy on the max-blocksize and that is why they put him in charge of this aspect of it.
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:10:11
It has clear advantages to make the blocksize a command-line param where miners have incentives to 1) facilitate transactions and 2) keep the blocksize as small as possible to maximize profit. 
This is the best solution, in my opinion, instead of some magic number that some guy decided that people should blindly accept due to his position.
I added this account to de-anonymize. Cheers
@_date: 2017-01-26 21:54:09
When there is an unconfirmed transaction backlog people stop using the network. When the usage goes down, you can make transactions like this, no problem. It's the lack of blocksize space during high-volume times that is a major issue.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:44:39
The vector I'm talking about is the MAX_BLOCK_SIGHASH where Bitcoin would prevent relaying excessively large sighash transactions. There is a fix for it. Should probably happen on both wallets either way.


See, the beautiful thing about it is that the network gets to decide and signal for what they think they can handle. TBH, they can all handle more than we are right now. Mining is very competitive, it's driven by strong economic forces. Miners want revenue (small blocks with higher fees) while also ensuring that the network continues to operate.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:49:07
You actually just proved my point. The title of that post was:


Over 50% of the community has been trying to voice opposition to this but if they post ANYTHING bad about Segwit it is deleted or disallowed. Only positive Segwit news is allowed. It's propaganda because only one side is allowed to talk. In fact, I can list several bad ideas that Segwit introduces here but I won't because I don't want to be banned.
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:17:20
It's not an attack. People are using Bitcoin to transact and the number of unconfirmed transactions are increasing as a result of new blocks being mined at a slower rate.
This is caused by the blocksize cap of 1MB. 
Not all transactions can fit on the bus while more people are getting in line to ride.
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:01:44
Blockstream's CEO went to china, had a meeting with all of the Chinese miners and promised them Segwit + a 2MB hard fork.
BitcoinCore added Segwit but not the 2MB hard fork that the miners wanted. This is why they are not upgrading.
Many of the miners are signaling 2-8 MB block support. Core is signaling to reduce the blocksize 300kb for no good reason.
There is a disconnect between the software that the miners, users and businesses want and the stuff that Core is outputting. It's that simple.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:58:13
It's actually Bitcoin's greatest weakness.


Nope. By design if people don't like the code that BitcoinCore is producing they can go elsewhere and run other Bitcoin software. That's how you protect Bitcoin from centralized developer corruption.
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:16:22
Uh, then why haven't they upgraded? Why is support for Segwit decreasing? Curious. What other grand explanation can you give? absent-minded people with millions of dollars of investment at stake? I think not.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:31:19
This is what happened. This might be inconvenient for you or you may not like it, but it's the truth if you ask any of the major mining pools that aren't supporting Segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:42:56
There are higher volumes during part of the day that can exacerbate the issue. You're correct though.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:50:25
You're disputing that Adam Back (Your companies CEO) went to China and signed an agreement with Chinese miners that BitcoinCore would implement a Segwit + 2mb hard fork? Then you're trying to rewrite common-knowledge history of just a few months ago. 
Now if you claim that Adam doesn't represent BitcoinCore then fine. But he did go and they did sign the agreement. I wonder why he would have went if he didn't think he represented or had influence over BitcoinCore development. Hmm, odd don't you think? You're not fooling anyone.


This is a personal attack - which you do a lot - I'm just going to ignore it. It doesn't look good on you.
Further, a new account to de-anonymize myself in the space means that I'm not worried about people knowing who I am.

I agree, and we've also seen miners switch from BitcoinCore pools to alternative client pools recently. BTCC's numbers have halved recently.
