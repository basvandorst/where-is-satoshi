BTC futures that your talking about, yes. But owning the physical crypto currency which is different because with futures you never truly own it. 
Real BTC is a long-term investment crypto. It's something to buy, stick in a wallet, encrypt the wallet, hide it and forget about it. Maybe once you have retired or when your kids or grand kids get to your age (depending on how old you are now) BTC will be in the millions.

Do you know who Steve Gibson is?
He wrote a 63/64 random character password algorithm that never produces the same password twice and in this words the genius that he is it would take the worlds top supercomputer computers 265 years times infinity to crack anyone of his passwords. I have few them as my wallet passwords. The likely of anyone hacking them...well good luck! :)

This is nothing new. It's actually quite old news, but doesn't surprise with the great firewall of China blocking stuff coming out of China that it's taken people this long to report this. :)

You'd think with is bitcoin's he'd be able to afford a new back window. :)

It's more like 0.1% chance of that happening. BTC is the peoples money.

I am pretty you haven't followed the life of bitcoin since the beginning. As you are arguing there could be a bug to steal private keys the chances of that are 1 in a infinity at this point. If BTC was to fail so would all the other world crypto currencies as BTC is considered to be back bone of the crypto market, its been here the longest and help drive up other crypto's and when its become unstable and lost some of its value so have the other crypto's. 
I started mining BTC when it at $145 per 1 BTC. The many coins I have mined are in a very safe place, out the reach of corrupt and insecure crypto exchanges. I too am waiting when 1.000000 BTC reaches 1 million USD then I can sell off 0.500000 of a BTC and live quiet comfortably.

1. Bitcoin is the people's money. It's not a fiat money. It will always be around no matter what happens in the market or if all the governments in the world decided to ban it. It would be worth lots because its a "people's money". 
2. If Bitcoin rose to 1 million USD then fell to 100k USD the folks who have a lot of BTC including myself wouldn't be hurt by this because most of us big holders have been with BTC when it started.

I don't use passwords on my wallet that are easy to crack. In fact in Steve Gibson's own words it would take the worlds super computers 256 times infinity to crack his 63 and 64 character passwords. :)
grc.com/password is a good place to get secure with your wallet, using more than one only makes it super tight. :P
