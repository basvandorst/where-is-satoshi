Android, I can look at the transaction and see the change address, but my balance is 0
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:25:46
I doubt I would have malware. It may be something I did. Ill try Greenbits. It very well could be a glitch, it's seemed glitchy from the start.
I was just testing the wallet out, trying to find a segwit mobile wallet.
Thanks for the help

How long can they keep this up?
this is like blockchain suicide bombing

Yes. Some of the most successful companies are the ones that find ways to sell you time. It's the only thing Amazon produces.

Yes I assume one coin would "win" and continue being the coin for value, and the other would turn into another alt coin. I don't really see an economic need to have more than one coin used as a representation of value. I think that's why all alt coin price charts look the same. 
I guess I'm just wondering what this means for the user as far as wallet management. Would you need to have a core wallet and a BU wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:54:00
I am 100% confident that you do not understand bitcoin mining. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:01:39
No, you would have 2 btc of each type. I guess you would use the same private keys to access each chain. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:46:24
I understand the votes come from miners, I'm asking if there is a way to choose which miners you patronize based on their segwit signaling. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:47:54
what spam? and any logical reason its a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:58:38
why would miners close down if BTC value is higher? if BTC value is higher, the remaining 20% of coins are still worth mining. The hash rate and price will continue to rise together, until (if) some equilibrium is reached where both level out.

What would this mean for the end user as far as managing wallets? 
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:38:46
I'll take it. Understandable 
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:37:19
Majority rule without backwards compatibility is a political attack. and I'm not talking about forking, I'm talking about building a new network.

Posted this on the other sub, they'd rather downvote than answer questions
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:11:33
Yes, I want to see currency competition. Let the best coin emerge. Hardfork is basically killing off one version of Bitcoin. I'd rather have the choice of either. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:01:14
Fire up the miners! Let's decentralize this bitch!!
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:16:02
Is it a bad idea?
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:21:09
Ok... so if having an open-source decentralized peer to peer cash system with low/no transactions fees isn't a solution, then exactly what is the problem?
@_date: 2017-03-06 04:20:03
Mining does not require permission. Anyone can start mining blocks that do not have a minimum fee. Permissionless access creates competition, and competition enforces good behavior.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:42:04
So what you are saying is that it would be too hard?
I'm not going to do anything, I'm just wondering why all the people complaining about bitcoin scaling aren't. I guess they would rather just complain and act like victims than do something to fix it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:54:46
If BU started a competing currency, would you use it? I just don't get why BU is arguing over scaling when there is nothing stopping anyone from creating what they believe to be the best solution.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:42:12
This is great! Bitcoin dodged a bullet
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:52:38
I don't think you understood the original question. It's not about what devs do or control. It's simply, why argue about the solution, when you are free to build it and offer it to the market?
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:47:45
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:08:15
Lol thanks for the advice
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:03:46
Seems the legacy banking system/regulations are doing everything they can to keep you in
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:09:24
Yes, exactly. except they could leverage the popularity of the scaling debate and BU among the bitcoin community. They could offer a temporary solution for all those complaining about transaction fees.
I think it would fail miserably but at least it wouldn't be a political attack on the consensus of the bitcoin network

I am a general contractor. We intentionally leave small things for the building inspectors to find. If we don't they come up with something.

@_date: 2017-01-02 04:27:41
hardware wallets are also a lot cheaper than a physical safe to store gold, and there are a lot more people capable of breaking into your gold safe than there are capable of breaking into a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:39:19
ya damn right
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:22:43
and thieves can steal your gold, surely this will dent the confidence of  gold buyers

@_date: 2016-12-17 15:10:07
I wouldnt worry about the miners mining empty blocks, they are missing out on transaction fees. eventually the miners that are filling blocks and collecting the additional transaction fees will use the additional income to grow. essentially decreasing the % of hashing power of the empty block miners.
Just a matter of time before the market corrects this behavior.  
@_date: 2016-12-17 14:56:11
Its not often you find leftist anti-profit rhetoric in the bictoin space
@_date: 2016-12-30 15:22:03
its amazing to see what people are capable of when pressed hard enough by market forces. these will probably be the areas where we see the most development in UI.

Many people don't realize Bitcoin exists

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:09:11
It's official, hard fork called off
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:23:21
And also allowing people to go straight from cash to Bitcoin without a bank account or arranging a buy from another person.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:50:41
I file taxes and I pay taxes at the end of each year. If you get a return it just means you paid too much all year and the gov has been holding your money interest free.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:17:54
Is that tax advice?
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:33:38
You're not a real bitcoiner until you buy high..... Twice
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:07:18
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:15:15
Because the fork doesn't have network consensus, and there is no replay protection in place. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:15:11
It's decentralized 
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:22:55
It's the same private key as the bitcoin on your hardware wallet.
If there is a fork...
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:38:17
Who gets a tax return??? Wtf.. you let the gov hold your money all year for free? Sounds crazy
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:28:19
youll have the keys to your B2X coins on your hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:46:29
I find it hard to care what some random reddit user thinks or finds hard to think. But yeah, I realize it's refund. First guy said return, I just went with it by mistake. Thanks for the correction though. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:08:24
They don't use bitpay
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:15:47
That's not bitpay. They have sentinel receive only wallet they use to create segwit receiving addresses. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:11:31
They aren't using bitpay. They use sentinel to create segwit receiving addresses for a trezor.
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:35:58
That's what I'm saying, they aren't using bitpay to receive payments at the steakhouse. They are creating segwit receiving addresses on sentinel.
