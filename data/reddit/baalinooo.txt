Quit bothering us.
Seriously Karpeles ?
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:58:51
He's the owner of Blockchain. Using others despair for self-promotion, specially after having backed Gox in the past, is pretty much a dick move in my book.

You would have my vote if I didn't live in Europe.

I think it has more to do with eBay's CEO announcement. It's huge.
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:18:39
This is amazing. Not rumors, but the actual **CEO of eBay** saying that Paypal **will** incorporate Bitcoin and that **he personally owns** Bitcoin. :D

That would be valid if these were still a bunch of guys working from their basement.
They've been making millions on commissions. Millions.
The least they can do is have people reviewing their code for known, documented problems.

I'm not in the US so i'm not sure I understand... Why would any of you guys comply? How could the IRS know about your BTC transactions if you don't tell them?

This would be great, but you'd have to give Google an incentive.

Yeah... they've manage to learn to use a computer, but they're still dinosaures.
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:44:47
This is pathetic.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:46:42
And for the bad reasons... For the life of me I can't understand the current market bullishness.

Careful. She's the Rebecca Watson of Libertarianism. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:33:26
The actual tweet. 
His opportunism is really disgusting, surfing on peoples losses to shamelessly promote his own company after having stated on YouTube that Gox had "no liquidity issues" and subsequently, after being proven wrong, nonchalantly deny it.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:46:06
I'm not in the US, so I'm not sure I understand... why would you guys even comply with the IRS? How could they even know that you have spent BTCs?
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:51:17
Not only is Bitstamp asking for way more information than banks typically do, they're only doing it the moment you want to *withdraw* funds. They're pretty happy to unconditionally accept your money, its only when the cash has to go in the other direction that they become pissy. This is unacceptable.
@_date: 2014-10-09 07:29:52
Wow, that guy is good.

What is your stance on religion, and the separation of church and state in particular?
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:13:50
Me too!
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:00:48
He keeps saying that he merely claimed that Gox had liquidity, not that it was solvent... which, when talking about an exchange, is basically the same.
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:50:19
It's not okay to be told that we are verified, for them to welcome with open arms our money and then start delaying things and making unreasonable requests when we want our money back. It's more than not ok, it's absolutely unaceptable.

Destroying a phone, any phone, when there are people out there that'd love to have one but can't afford it... :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:47:00
That's cool man. Did you have any prior knowledge of programing?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:06:23
Good for you. With that said, a few hours ago, a significant number of people have lost all their BTCs. Their life savings for some. I don't think this is appropriate at such a time.
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:01:54
This is very scary. Could any of you guys with big fiat in Stamp do a test withdrawal and tell us how it went...?
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:38:06
