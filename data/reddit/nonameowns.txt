only invest what you can afford to lose
also is your security top notch? would be a shame if you accidentally lose the wallet or stolen, keylogger,virus,etc. if you're stupid with computer, stay away, unless you can educate yourself properly.
 google sandboxie (use it for internet), 
keepass (pw manager. use unique password for everything), truecrypt (protect from physical theft), 
dropbox (to backup in case of hard drive crash. make sure it's encrypted before you upload), 
armory wallet (most secured wallet if you follow cold storage instruction), and
 [understand how passwords work and read the padding policy, it will help you remember complex pw](
if you do the above correctly, the only way for someone to steals your coin is physical torture
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:25:51
bitcoins is a P2P currency which mean you are 100% responsible for your own wallet. stolen? too bad.
there is no laws associating with bitcoin so there are no such thing as "crime" if the laws don't recognize it as such
mortality would said yes it is a crime but shut up you jesus freak, it is not a way of life

that's the problem. once something used to be manual work then now automate, less people is necessary to understand how things work. only maintenance is necessary and handful of engineers for assistance. 
we are quickly going toward the mindset of it just works without understanding how the fuck it work. this make people give up easily when challenged by difficult topics.

use sandboxie for internet. it is a light virtual environment that barrier part of your hdd and act like a spider web trapping everything and require your approval to save shit to your computer. you also can easily wipe the session and start fresh every time. other cool thing is your antivirus can scan the content in sandboxie and delete trapped viruses
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:34:22
no. it's just a client that sync the blockchain and a regular wallet. best you can do with it is encrypt it and backup. 
armory wallet is the only app that does cold storage (offline wallet) properly. basically you make a wallet offline and then export to a computer that is online to make watching only wallet which allows you to receive transactions and can't spend coins. want to spend coins? make a unsigned transaction then transfer to offline wallet to sign it then xfer back to broadcast to confirm. [it's recommended if you got load of coins](

blockchain online wallet is fine but the breach of entry is the password. with cold storage, only way to breach it is [gain physical access](
you can only have convenience or security, but not both. [however there is lastpass for noobs](
I personally prefer keepass for local storage and no dependence on 3rd parties is awesome
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:09:09

don't preorder until those who already preordered get their rigs. might be late this month, april, or until july. from there it's recommended to buy one.
the predicted bitcoin difficulty will be 10 time more once people start running ASIC rigs.
since the performance to cost ratio is shit for GPU mining, ASIC is the opposite. cheap with insane speed.
for instance, [with 60 GH/s $1300 rig](
with the difficulty adjusted to 10 times more and the conversion rate set to $60 for a year, you may break even within a month and make up to 7 time the cost in [profit]( (gonna fill in numbers to see the result)
if the conversion rate halves to $30, you may break even within 2 months and make up to 3 times the cost in profit.
OR the ASIC could finally arrive and crash bitcoins to dust or shoot up to 10 time more the value. OR the difficulty may jump 100 times more and make ASIC mining unprofitable!!!
we don't know jack shit until we see the results.
it's exciting and scary isn't it?

[type info here]( $600 cost, 400 watts, 1000 mh/s [source](
it will take you 107 days to break even and  havenegative 420.31. it will take you 4 months to have $66 in profit. that's is with the current difficulty. when ASIC is common, you're burning your gpu for nothing
so if you really want to mine, buy a ASIC rig. wait til summer though when ppl get their order from butterfly labs to determine if it's worth buying

you didn't adjust the difficulty for when ASIC is common. that would be 10-100x more the current difficult depending on the adoption rate. from there, margin profit is possible. you will need to keep buying more asic rigs to be upfloat

mining for free right now will make you 223.81 bucks in a month. that's $7.46 each day. double the difficulty, half the profit. from there difficulty go up, your profit go down. it's far more practical to buy a ASIC rig when the reviews are good this coming summer

usb drive and cloud backup is cheap and painless to do long term. what is more dangerous is remembering the encryption password. 
[scroll to bottom to read about password padding. make complicated pw easy to remember](
what is the odd of someone beating the crap out of you and you lose some of your memory?  in an accident? can you really trust someone to tell the pw to? etc
my security method are the following:
truecrypt file container with a unique pw to save the encrypted wallet (unique pw as well), and locked keepass database (yep you guessed it) which contain the wallet pw (100 characters bro) and whole bunch of different online accounts pw. 
where are the pw to access those stored? in my head. how? read the padding policy above. it's easy to remember 24 random characters pw :D
now, the truecrypt file container is synced to dropbox as well exist on my hard drive and usb drive. as long you have at least 1 backup, you will be fine.
I have not yet decided what to encode the sensitive info on a physical material and hand to someone who don't know much about technology. physical security is an issue as well. if i died before i figured out this, the efforts are wasted since there is a single point of failure; me.
