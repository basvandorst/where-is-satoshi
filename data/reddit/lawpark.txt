I think what you are actually asking for is something my friends and I have been discussing, we call it, "Open Source Government."
The idea is that all laws, changes, modifications, etc., should be done in an open way with justifications on why certain words are used. Right now, laws are made in the back room, with a committee of lobbyist and lawyers.
It needs to be open.  It needs to be public.  It needs to be "Open Source."
Government is for the people, by the people, and our elected officials are only a small part of government.  HHS (Health and Human Services) in 2015 will take up an amazing 1 trillion dollars of our federal budget.  Who is in charge of HHS?  Who decides what grants get picked?  Not one of the people are elected or have (sufficient, in my opinion) oversight.
This is where "Open Source Government" can come in and debate can happen, which is open for everyone to see.  True transparency, not the type we have now.
This type of "Wiki" government allows all aspects of, let's say, the grant process for universities, to be wide open.  
In this way, we know the names of the campaign donor who just so happens to own a company that is also getting lucrative contracts. 
What I am saying is, we pay for the government and all aspects of it, we should have more say, and if not, at least be able to see and document what it is doing.
I went to the HHS website to see the new budget for 2015?  The "Budget in Brief" is over 100 pages long.
