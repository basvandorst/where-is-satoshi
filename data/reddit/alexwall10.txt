Totally agree, this one makes sense. I also like that it kinda looks like a rocket...or maybe that’s just me haha

Ok, so it’s official, we know there’s 4000. Can everyone stop posting pictures of bitcoin ATM’s now please, I think I’ve seen most of them! Lol

If the shirtless guy who started this is Bitcoin... the guy in the black vest and cowboy hat at the very end is the Banks. So mad thinking, “I had such a great spot here, now all these fuckers have ruined it, all started because of that idiot “bitcoin” over there!”

Hey guys....just so you all know, it doesn’t matter. If bitcoin goes up, it doesn’t matter. If it goes down, it doesn’t matter.

It definitely would help. Even a regular cashier at a grocery store. If they get asked 5 times in a week, they will say, “Hey Mr. Manager, people keep asking if we take bitcoin?? Is that something we are going to do?”
Asking at every store you go into, would make a big difference...compared to not even mentioning it lol the difference is massive!!
Just ask guys, make it a habit! ����

I’m sure people will start to use companies such as Safe Haven on the Vechain blockchain to make sure the enormous wealth they have accumulated is passed on to their loved ones!
