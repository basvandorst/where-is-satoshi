Misleading title. It’s a blockchain ETF that invests in companies utilizing blockchain technology. Seems to have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

Probably shouldn’t be? It says they have banned trading for some accounts with dubious activity. I think every major country with bitcoin exchanges will try to stop trading on accounts that may involve illegal activity. Not that banks or exchanges suspending accounts is ideal, but rather just to be expected in my opinion. The title on this post is fairly misleading.

Hasn’t gone up or down drastically for months now? It wasn’t even at 10k till the end of November then went to just below 20k and back down. I feel like people watch for a week then make super broad statement about the state of the market.

I didn’t say everything changed. I said people care, which they obviously do. Cboe also does not offer physically settled futures like bakkt is attempting to do.
Edit: not to mention you have no idea what impact the introduction of futures may have had on institutional interest. Even if they didn’t change behavior immediately it may have made them start to investigate it as an option.

Agree with you basically, but an explanation or counter argument doesn’t necessarily need to be easy to add legitimacy to it. Some concepts are complicated, including those surrounding money, and require complex and thoughtful answers.

Not sure about the purpose of a stop loss only $150 below market price. Bitcoin can easily fluctuate way more than that on a daily basis. Could easily drop $200 and fill your order, then proceeded to shoot back up a few hundred/thousand.

Is Bitcoin the racehorse in this example? As much as I love bitcoin and believe in its potential I don’t thinks it’s there yet.
Or maybe bitcoin is the donkey? Slower but more used for many other tasks that don’t prioritize speed?

Ever consider they got to work at 8 and then organize for an hour or two before testing started? Not that it matters a single bit what time of day testing starts for a platform that has an estimated launch date months out.

Futures are not the same as ETFs though. Also, physically settled futures are not the same as other exchange traded investment vehicles in terms of market manipulation.
Edit: not to say that its ideal compared to owning bitcoin directly. Some of the points about forks and such would still apply in some cases

It’s no different than paying for any other schooling. Yes, with the internet you could probably eventually get this information. However, this puts it all in one spot with guidance from and interaction with researchers and professors at MIT who actually work with with and study blockchain technology.
Edit: missing word
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:26:01
It’s not the current dip people are worried about! People are worried because CME is going to list futures, which will allow traditional big investors to bet against bitcoin. Reasonable concerns, but I am hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:38:44
You don’t just spend all the principal until it’s gone though. With $4 mil you could easily make way over 5k a month with very safe and stable investments and live off that for life without losing a penny of the $4 mil. It is a lot of money. Even if you only earned 5% a year on that it’s over $15k a month.

He asked how to promote it in his local area! Spending at local merchants might spark the interest of an owner or employee and create another hodler! Spending and replacing still produces the same hoarding effect since you have no net change in bitcoin while allowing others to experience it as well. 
Edit: This also seems a bit dated. Says initial price was caused by holders and the next step would require more. Think we may be a few steps from there.
@_date: 2018-08-26 17:28:52
It doesn’t. Spend and replace if you really want to help adoption.

At the moment it seems like bitcoin behaves more like an asset. So they are doing exactly what you said and have chosen bitcoin as their asset?

I disagree, decentralization is currently part of the definition of a cryptocurrency. If a centralized entity has control it doesn’t really fit that definition. There are plenty of others out there that don’t it it either. Digital assets is one thing but cryptocurrencies need to fit the definition!
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:23:41
Thanks for the input! Was just surprised that there would even be an option to keep both.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:31:28
I get wanting to have direct control/ownership of private keys, but I haven't heard anything and ledger offering a similar kind of replay protection. Is this something that is going to be commonly added to most exchanges and wallets? This was this first I had heard of that being an option

So his money is where his mouth is? I would find it more odd if he said this and wasn’t invested in the space and success of bitcoin.

That would be over 100 years from now. If people are not transacting much with it by then then Bitcoin will probably have died
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:08:49
I'm always kind of surprised by how many people panic sell. I've always taken buy low and sell high to heart, which if you are in for the long term seems like the way to go (or just hodl). If I see the price start to fall I just assume it's already too late to get out on top and get ready to buy some more. I do the same if it starts going up and try not to "panic" buy to get in on gains. Panic selling just seems silly unless you really think it's headed straight for $0!
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:41:55
Seems like a lot of what you said just isn’t how it works
Edit: the number of mining devices shouldn’t be affected and if anything there would be fewer miners running/ being sold if the profitability drops from the reward having. Electricity costs also stay the same. Profitability drops for all mining operations by the same proportion and if the price of bitcoin doubled at the same time then profitability would match what it was before the halving and everything would be basically the same in terms of mining.
@_date: 2019-06-07 17:32:30
Then you have found a definition of cryptocurrency that includes that. There is no shortage definitions for cryptocurrency around and I think most would not include this or. Arguing over the exact definition is somewhat silly though since I’m not sure that’s it 100% concrete anyway. I think most people in the space consider decentralization a requirement to be a cryptocurrency and would use the term digital asset or token for other things such as this.
It looks like Facebook wants to tie it to fiat currencies as well, so in my mind it’s probably more a centralized stablecoin and I wouldn’t call that a cryptocurrency. Haven’t read all the details of their planned coin though
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:17:55
You said it yourself! “You as the consumer rely on the trust that the centralized authority is not disrupting cryptographic functions in some way.” 
The entire point of bitcoin is I don’t need to trust anyone. It doesn’t matter if the centralized authority uses cryptographic functions because if they really are the authority then they can change the rules at any time. If you say it’s decentralized except for the centralized authority, then it isn’t decentralized and isn’t a cryptocurrency.

Really? Because energy use is one of the biggest criticism of Bitcoin from the general public. It makes sense to compare it to something less significant that probably uses more energy that no one seems to have any problem with. Just one small example he provided!
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:06:26
Did you read why they are developing one? You clearly don’t know the basics about either. Even Jamie diamond who is bitcoins biggest critic says blockchain is the real deal despite what he thinks about bitcoin.
 
I don’t know what part of I know we have a good working system and that was one example of a potential weak point in it do you keep missing? Also if you really want one the Great Depression can also be party attributed to policy. Not to mention almost every country in the world has fiat and many have managed to completely destroy their currency with hyperinflation. Yes the dollar and US are successful. That’s not the only fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:38:02
Well it has dropped a lot recently. Certainly wouldn’t say it’s being manipulated up at the moment.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:21:18
First mistake is listening to “people everywhere.” Only one side tends to be vocal at a time and that is determined by which way the price is moving that day. Best to do your own research and invest if you think it has potential long term.
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:00:20
The founder of PayPal, one of the worlds largest payment and money transfer platforms, thinks that there is another tech in the space with potential that may directly compete with his business. It not like 50 cent or some other random celebrity endorsement. Probably worth at least listening to what he has to say. 
Also, people saying how great it is and encouraging use is exactly what got it off the ground to begin with and will help it continue to grow regardless of its ultimate success or failure.
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:32:04
More that they were probably lowered too long. Anyway, it would have been less likely and much much less severe, but I feel like you think I dislike fiat and that isn’t the case at all. 
I just study finance and like to learn about the evolution of money. Fiat combined with the private creation of debt to make liquidity is a fairly new concept and may come with some flaws. One of them being that government makes policies that have far reaching effects on economies. I don’t think that fiat is somehow fundamentally flawed or necessarily the root cause of those problem. It’s the best thing we’ve had so far... except maybe bitcoin.
Bitcoin isn’t even being classified as a currency yet because of its features and is a very new technology so volatility is to be expected. Doesn’t mean as it matures it won’t be the best thing since fiat!
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:22:55
Blockchain and bitcoin are separate things. You don’t know. You don’t care. Have a good night and try not to stay so angry

Exactly. So he is comparing it to something trivial like cooling beverages to make that same point about how the energy usage isn’t that bad.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:37:52
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are not the same thing at all. Cryptocurrencies are created by and run on blockchains, but you don’t need to publicly sell a token to have one. Major banks and companies such and Walmart have made their own private blockchains for internal efficiencies and its widely accepted as breakthrough technology. It’s just a new much better accounting system that can also be used for data and supply chains to name a few things! Bitcoin just happens to be its original use case!
You keep missing the part where I say it was just an example of what can happen in a single situation. It’s controlled by humans and human error is a thing. I have no deep rooted with problem and just think bitcoin is an interesting new approach and concept. The blockchain is amazing. Bitcoin has potential!
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:30:25
Congratulations, you figured out that bitcoin is new and the system we have now revolves around and was built on fiat currencies as well as the fact that I’m not over 100 years old. Also, 70-80 years isn’t a long time and 2008 isn’t the first economic disaster caused by policy making. Older civilizations that were just as successful have fallen due to poor policy and foresight.
Also never said anything relating to our system not being successful or that I could do it better. All I said was that policy making (connected to fiat, which was the question) was indeed the cause of the 2008 financial crisis. Try checking out the Clinton administration, repeal of glass-stegall to make banks more internationally competitive, and Alan Greenspan/low interest rates leading up to it all.
It just so happens that bitcoin is deflationary, has a fixed maximum supply, and isn’t directly influenced by governments the way fiat is. That was my only point so sorry if that hurt your feelings.
Since you want my qualifications I have and undergrad and masters degree in finance, have been working in the finance industry, and am currently applying to PhD programs in economics. What are yours?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:59:15
Lol you are just a troll. Literally made a reddit account just to shit on tech you don’t take the time to learn the basics of!
Guess some of the biggest US companies love ponzis. All you do is call names and get mad while making statements you know nothing about and refusing to read anything related to the subject. It will and already does have broad applications across almost all major industries from finance, shipping, healthcare, and government. Choose to be blind if you want. I never said bitcoin is a guaranteed thing and you are the one throwing out our words like worship. I just think it’s cool new I tech and has potential. Again, try to calm down. I realize it’s easy to get worked up yelling about a topic you don’t understand online. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:15:37

Haha, this is amazing!!
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:02:11
No that’s not what I did at all. I blamed low interest rates and the fed encouraging borrowing for prolonged periods of time for creating mass debt in the economy, which was a precursor of the crisis. I didn’t say anything about CDOs or CDSs because their regulation is a separate issue along with corruption in financial institutions. My point was fiat is government issued meaning the supply and interest rates can be manipulated as those in charge see fit. The ones in charge are human and can make mistakes like everyone. I didn’t say anything about corruption because it doesn’t tie in and you analogy doesn’t line up.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:47:51
Fair enough. I honestly wouldn’t say it’s being manipulated at all necessarily. It’s crypto and big gains come with big pull backs. Hard for me to pinpoint any cause in this crazy market.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:07:59
It has to do with the fed setting extremely low interest rates for long periods of time to encourage borrowing to stimulate the economy. The heavy borrowing and insane amounts of debt led to people making investments anywhere they could and loans being made to those who were not really credit worthy. What you said is true but the building blocks that allowed it to happen came from federal policy, which is only possibly with fiat currencies.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:29:25
Having a little trouble taking one example of a problem that did actually happen as nothing more that an example this it can happen. That is was was the only point. Kids get so mad online these days. “Can’t bother to read” and “don’t fucking care.” Then dont comment!
