So basically your argument boils down to "government somehow will stop it but I don't know exactly how" is that correct?   
You might want to read about technology because you seem to be ignrant of this part. I too had the same reactions as you until I dug deep into how the system works and why it is so antifragile (the word means it gets harder to attack after each attack).  
Bottom line is, that I neither do you know what will happen in the future. I think that bitcoin will succeed but I'm not some oracle to go around and tell everybody that it will beat government 100%, and everyone who disagree is simply wrong. Sure it gives me hope in better future, sure I will feel despair if it fails.   
I can tell however when I see someone who doesn't know what he's talking about on the basis of hundreds of hours put into the subject.

It all depends what is your toleration to risk. Remember when you invest in bitcoin stock you take on the risk of owning a stock plus owning bitcoin. Bigger risk, bigger returns.  
Keep in mind that in any early stage of an industry companies bankrupt at much higher rate than in already estabilished market.

You're right, but remember it's a risk/reward ratio based decision. When you change the mining algorithm you instantly wipe out all the mining power. This would lead to rampant double spends and loss of confidence in the protocol.    
Mining power could end up in the hands of few hands but I think it's unlikely. The market is very small right now, so by very it's nature is more centralised. When the economy will grow the mining will be more distributed.

There's assumption in your sentence, which I think is false. There are lots of incompetent businesses but those situation happen even with regulation. Opposite is also true - there are many reputable exchanges that use high security measures right now. Regulation will simply increase barrier of entry and scare off many people to open a business.

Also let me add that multisig is coming and someone will figure out how to incorporate that to trading engine. Also, Open Transactions. There's more - soon we will see decentralized exchanges popping left and right.

You are wrong and/or misunderstood what i said. When liquidity pool goes up, so the price and most important, volatility goes down. This has been consistent trend trough bitcoin history. Those who bought at the last top, assuming that bitcoin will continue to expand could easily get back to initial  price, and even surpass it. But again, I'm not talking about the present, but future indicator of success.    
Also, look up the historical value of gold to see that volatility hasn't stopped people using it as a store of value.   
Lastly ad hominem attacks doesn't prove anything, and you could be treated as troll.

Like everything in bitcoin we should pursue decentralization. What I would propose is using some existing controller (like arduino but way smaller) to make open source project mimicking trezor. This would maximize cooperation making the device more robust and safe. Not everyone is a geek so people can sell this in ready to use package ensuring much lower price than trezor. Also, open standard would encourage to have wider application than bitcoin wallet. It could be used as universal authentication device, for example.

My bet would be that few altcoins will survive the new gold rush. Will it be dogecoin? I really don't know, but sure the network effect is getting stronger with this one. 
   
I don't understand why some people get emotional about this. Bitcoin is open source and is bound to have forks. If you get angry, because you are afraid your bitcoins will be rendered worthless by any altcoin you should really consider investing in it. Mindless bashing just hurt the community as a whole.

OK got it.    


  
Never said that foundation claims you should trust it. 


  
This is the point I (somewhat sloppily) trying to make. 


This is where you misunderstood me. When I said there is no such thing as group I meant that it doesn't exist in physical world, only as a concept in our heads. It is perfectly valid to talk about that, however one must recognise that it isn't merely an abstract concept but refers to real  individuals.   
The default position in rational human being is lack of trust until proven otherwise. The foundation isn't known to be composed of honest people (you rightfully brought up Karpeles). It's reckless to disregard all bad things that individuals do and then defend abstract concept of a group as if it lives outside of people's actions. Treating everyone in the group as scammers is an overkill but surely it is wise to be suspicious of their actions.

The "master key" as you called it isn't a 3rd party service but is provided by the laws of mathematics.    
Computer can't really generate true random numbers so it uses complex formulas to simulate the unpredictability of randomness. The formulas in order to be "random" need to be seeded by some other, random number. Usually this number is by applying some other mathematical operations to current time or even keystrokes and/or mouse movements. The important part is that seed must be unique and random to get random numbers.   
But what happens when you use the same, known seed? You will get the same string of number that appear random but can be recreated using the seed. Your "master key" in form of randomly generated words is the seed here. So when you pop it in Electrum it will give you the same addresses every time. You don't have to worry about backing up the wallet after every 100 transactions. You do it only once and you can use the same wallet on multiple devices at the same time.   
Another cool feature of Electrum is that it doesn't download the whole blockchain. So you can use it immediately after installing.

I agree with that. It could be devastating if truly malicious pool would gain the majority. I was merely contemplating the probability of this scenario. Simple fact is that people respond to incentives. If GHash would go on double spend rampage that would diminish business greatly, and may even result in competition taking over.   
Only bad scenario I could imagine is government snooping around such company. Even then they couldn't do much. Worst case scenario - they force series of changes to the protocol. Big deal, we just move over to the proper fork and all is fine and dandy. 
I maybe overly optimistic, but given that people doesn't just act randomly I don't see a scenario in which single company would to take over the network.

Imagine two villages. In village one John is selling bacon for $2. In village two, just across the river Mark is selling for $1. Most people from village one doesn't have time to walk across the river just to save one buck. Mary comes along with free time on her hands and decide to buy most of the bacon in village two and sell for $1,5 in village one.   
 This process is called arbitrage and leads to equating the price across both villages. Imagine now that village two passes law that no bacon can be transported outside its territory. Arbitrage ends and prices in both villages are again very different.      
Replace village with bitcoin exchange, bacon with BTC .

Those people try to regulate something they don't even understand. I bet you've read some ignorant statements from those people. That's hardly specialists.     
Aside from that. I don't deny that those people are smart (well, most of them). But still they are few people and doesn't have all necessary information to make optimal decisions. Compare that with free market, which makes decisions by evolution basically. Information and risk is distributed so any decision is optimal for current state. You start out with few weak enterprises (mtgox) and successively build into more serious industry. Just look how the IT sector grew in those few years. It's because people wanted to use specific products, not because some regulators said so. The price paid for that (some people lost funds) is much lower than the indirect price paid in highly regulated environment IMO.

You know you aren't making any argument? Especially claiming that I have "distorted view". Let's analyze that, shall we?     
  
So, assuming I have distorted view and yet I entered a discussion. Either I know that I have distorted view or I don't know it. If I know it, I'm not really having distorted view but I'm lying to troll you. If I don't know it, any discussion with me won't have any effect unless you will made some solid logical arguments to correct said distortion.    
Assuming I don't have distorted view, this is basically ad hominem. Which is designed to attack person making the claim and not rebut claim itself.   
Your "argument" can be applied in context of 1939 Germany. Unless you give me some distinction. 
Lastly, are you sure that this "helping around the world" isn't something you heard rather than reason and research it for yourself? Because I have and have vastly opposite conclusions.

This week’s branch-opening received a terrific response from the general public. Attendees were amazed with the quality of the space and appreciated how much more educated they became after learning more about Bitcoin from our team. We opened many customer accounts, however, due to the MtGox situation, we withheld the sale of bitcoins temporarily to avoid immediate “loss” for customers that day and to keep focus on Neo and the benefits of Bitcoin.






























  and accountability is encouraging.

You mean with the group thing? I admit this sounded bit confusing. Let me explain  it better.  
 Let's say there's a organisation called 'Awesomely honest people' (AHP) . Let's assume that it presents itself in the mainstream media as very serious and legitimate group. People will naturally have higher trust in this group than, for example, random Joe on the Internet. However, this group is fundamentally composed of random people on the Internet, and only overhead is the membership fee. Scammer Bob have extra cash laying around (maybe from stealing, who knows)  and decides to join the organisation. If the group have any integrity, they need to check if Bob isn't malicious and will try to use membership to defraud people. Sure if they don't check Bob's reputation they might lose theirs.   
So, Bob manages to get into the AHP and steal some goods. Is it unreasonable to then say that we should be sceptical of whole organisation?

Imagine it like this.    
Assume bitcoinqt has pool of 5 addresses instead of 100. Also lets say that instead of usual Bitcoin format (1Df5Uyjo3....) those are numbered starting at one.
Here are the starting balances:   
Address number | Balance (BTC)
1                   | 5      
2                   | 0
3                   | 0
4                   | 0
5                   | 0
  
When you make a payment for 3 BTC from address *1* to some address *x*, the client will split the 5 BTC into two addresses. 3 BTC will go to *x* and the rest to address *2* (this is your change). Now you have:    
Address number | Balance (BTC)
1                   | 0      
2                   | 2
3                   | 0
4                   | 0
5                   | 0
Each payment tries to empty earliest address. Now, since address *1* has zero balance, is not needed and will be disposed of. Bitcoinqt will automatically create new address to fill the pool of 5 addresses:
Address number | Balance (BTC)
----------------|---------     
2                   | 2
3                   | 0
4                   | 0
5                   | 0
6                   | 0
After many payments you'll end up with completely new pool of addresses from 6 to 10.    
You have a copy of your wallet sitting on a thumb drive that you created a while ago, before you made all those transactions. It lists addresses from 1 to 5 but knows nothing about 6 to 10. So when you try to import it you find out that the balance is zero and all your coins are lost.    
Try Electrum if you find this troublesome.

I agree that increment of tx/s would be desirable. However if it were that simple there wouldn't be artificial limit in the first place. Storage is not a problem because you can use Merkle tree to prune old transactions anyway. The real problem is the increasing latency with increasing data size. As I recall there were some guys on bitcointalk who proposed pretty promising solution. I am on my phone right now and slow one for that matter, so I will provide the link when I get home.

I understand where Gavin is coming from, but I think the fees won't be a problem. Bitcoin technology is cheap and efficient so there's no economic way in which it will end up in few rich hands. History clearly shows this consistently.   
It goes like this:
1. Certain goods are for the rich only;
2. New technological revolution taking place;
3. The similar or better goods are available to wider audience.    
Bitcoin wipes out whole banking system. I know it's digital, but behind the curtain the are real people doing slow and expensive paperwork. Since Bitcoin makes all that obsolete, work needed to run whole system is that much smaller. Since work is money, fees will adjust accordingly (read: It will be cheap as hell compared to what we have now).

Completely baseless claim. Would you make the same argument about the Internet in '93? Because Internet started as this difficult technical mumbo jumbo. On top of that in mainstream mind it was overrun with pedophiles and other criminals.   There were people like you back then saying it will never take off.    


By unfair you mean totally honest and fair. Bitcoin was there in the open. You just had to look and read about it. You present classic case of hindsight bias. No one knew bitcoin would take off and yet lots of people dedicated time and effort in building infrastructure  and mining. You want invalidate all that because some people got rich? Free market isn't about equal distribution of wealth.

Before the federal reserve there were freedom on currency. Everyone could create one, leaving the free market to determine their value. Once currency is established and the owner decides he wants to print bunch of notes making him rich, he devaluates all other existing notes leaving mob of angry people. This of course will led to exodus to other currencies. **It is important to remember that this scenario isn't theft, because violence isn't involved.**   
Federal reserve is protected by violence of the government to ensure that no one else has the right to print money. This is evident in examples of Liberty Dollar and E-Gold. This of course eliminates risks of devaluating currency to a point when everyone switches to competitors, because there are none. This situation is very beneficial to government, because now it has power to control economy at its basic level enabling them to condone huge amounts of deficit spending. This is evident in all the wars USA is in. **In this scenario we see clear violence, and thus it is theft.**

Better investment than Bitcon are beanie babies. At least you have something concrete in your hands that won't dissapear without a trace, and when there will be a war with Russia or Germany you can warm yourself with it.

I wasn't born yesterday and bitcoins from begining seemed to me nice swindle. Like paper pyramid, buy buy because price will be higher ;) Morons like in Amber Gold (*it's a company that stole some money*)

Bitcoin is 6 years old, and it had upturns and downturns. Relatively short period of time of a year isn't something you can use to abolish my argument. Also adoption isn't directly translated to price. There are uknown number of factors involved. Therefore any model you put in place can't ever be predictive, it only can give us general idea of a possible long time trend.   
Also I don't appreciate your snarky tone.

Funny how often objections to new solution describes current one.      
You can speculate which is better all day long, but in the end it's not up to you. You are free to use inflation coin but the majority of people want their money to gain value.   
Argument about stagnating economy is fallacious, because it assumes that people will hoard indefinitely. 
Will deflation diminish spending a little? Sure, but that's a good thing. Money have to have store of value and deflation objectively is better at it.  
Inflation is only valuable to few, that have monopoly on money. By spending freshly made notes they don't experience inflation. Only after some time market realises this increase and adjust prices accordingly. To be blunt, it's fraud. With decentralized system no one has the incentive to push such "solution".  
To sum up, you are looking at money from only one side. In reality for money to have value, it has to be hoarded.

You seem to respond with incomprehension, while this article is totally predictable. The conventional media are heavily dependent on the state for all sort of licensing and information source. Funding of the media also come from big companies who are largely invested in current financial system. Those people simply operate on economic incentives, like all of us.

Tax evasion, which Wikipedia defines as "...deliberately misrepresenting the true state of their affairs to the tax authorities to reduce their tax liability and includes dishonest tax reporting, such as declaring less income, profits or gains than the amounts actually earned, or overstating deductions.." you will go to prison for.
  
Never signed any contract in which I agreed to those rules. I simply must comply because the threat of prison.

Bitcoin transactions are instant. Confirmation means that transaction (effectively) can't be reversed. Have in mind that credit card confirmation is 1 month.    
EDIT: Let me clarify. I know that I'm not comparing apples to apples. I did the comparison because effectively it boils down to merchant risk. By credit card confirmation I ment period in which customer can file a charge-back. When he does so, merchant takes a risk that he could never see the money he allegedly received. The same is true with Bitcoin but the risk period is much smaller. Of course no one will sell a car for 0-confirmation transaction. But double spending just to get free groceries is insane. Attacker would have to set nodes in multiple places of the network to relay double transaction (honest nodes will not broadcast double spend).

Gold is valued because it is best to use as money. What gives it value is the use case, not the details that made the use case possible (seven characteristics of money). Saying that gold is valued because it's scarce is analogous to saying that Tesla car is valued because it has electric motor. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:53:01


The reason is that gold is much harder to carry than paper. Currency is however different than money as it lacks store of value property (all paper currency goes to zero over time).
  


This is what I had in mind. It was adopted not because it was scarce but it had all the properties that a thing needs to be money (including scarcity).  


 
See above.   


Analogy was that I concentrated on single property which is only part of the picture - people wan't Tesla cars in totality, not only for some specific isolated reason.

If I pull out a gun and demand that you give me your wallet and then buy you some stuff from half of the stolen money, will my theft be just?  


  
I used "run away" on purpose in my analogy. Because If I don't agree with taxes and I won't pay them, the state will go after me because I'm criminal in their world. Getting other citizenship isn't a solution because:  
- it is not easy to get it  
- I will have to pay my taxes over there.   
  
The fact that I have to pay up for essential stuff like roads and healthcare is not relevant because the state is forbidding competition in those areas. If I think I can provide better service to people I will be thrown in a cage for simply trying to better the world.

LTC follows similar vision as bitcoin - truly decentralized, conservative in terms of technology. This made litecoin pretty stable compared to other alts - most of them follow pump and dump patterns but with litecoin there is slow but steady growth. Since it has different mining algorithm you don't use ASICs but graphics cards. This means it wasn't subject to Chinese miners manipulation and was able to activate segwit before bitcoin. Now that both have this technology you can do atomic swaps - trustless switch from one chain to the other without trusted parties. This is a good hedge against problems with bitcoin network, primarily miner centralization.

You are correct. Fees are essential part in keeping system balanced. If block space runs out sure there will be high fees.    
Keep in mind that simply increasing block size isn't a solution because then cost of running a full node rises to a point where fewer people can participate in verification of the blocks. This means that it becomes only viable for larger operations - basically centralizing whole network in hands of the few.

Keep in mind that US state isn't a company. They don't produce any goods and services. So where the money comes from that US is lending? By taxing the population. The more it lends out, the more it must raise taxes on citizens. So people in the government make out like bandits, and the rest must pay more every year.

Yes. Not that I have an alternative.
Let me boil down this in analogy. I have door to door newspaper delivering business. One day I sadly notice that my subscription sales are declining. To improve my situation I decide to get my good 'ol rifle and force people to give me money. They don't have to buy my newspapers. They just have to give me money. Is it fair to say that they really like my newspapers if they continue to take them?  
The state situation is worse - not only it extracts money by force but actively prohibits competition - in the case of roads it's by owning land and issuing licenses. So to come in and provide better service is nearly impossible.

How blockchain is more useful over ordinary database when you drop the bitcoin?   
Spoiler: blockchain is only useful as a medium of storing decentralized assets.  
Firstly - it's very inefficient. When miners race to find new block they are using lots of power. Ever increasing difficulty makes this exponential growth.  
Secondly - miners even bother because they earn reward of token that the network represents. 
Thirdly - miners don't trust each other because of math. Everyone can verify that the other guy isn't doing something funny.  
Now, how do you adapt this to banking? When you have private blockchain what is the point of mining? Bank 'nodes' can simply establish SSL connection and use SQL to store all the data.

People are heavily invested in current system simply by working, spending money, saving, paying taxes.  Invention of cryptocurrency sheds light on curruption in finance. Without comparison, fiat currency is simply reality with no alternative. It's analogous to medieval times where not believing in God was so incomprehensible that it weren't up for debate (also the violence kinda helped to keep mouth shut). When alternative comes around that is fundamentally different, it triggers great anxiety and, to most people it translates to dismissal of the idea. Few people can recognize this anxiety as internally generated state. Only then one is able to judge the facts on its own merits.  
People know this stuff subconsciously and instantly. I recommend the book Blink by Malcolm Gladwell to read more about this principle.

Computers can't really generate true random numbers so in order to generate a number that appears random enough they use something called seed. It's usually some combination of system time and user input. Computer uses this to make some complex calculations to produce pseudorandom number. This process is deterministic so from the same seed you get the same set of numbers.   
Electrum does this with private keys. The seed is your string of words from which the same keys are derived.

Oh boy. I will be linking this thread everywhere when ETH finally comes crashing down. Not because I wish other crypto to fail out of spite. But because people are economic illiterates and fail to see shaky fundamentals Ethereum is built on.   
ETH might do amazing things but infinite money supply and less decentralized infrastructure than bitcoin will make pricing of the token much lower than it is now.   
I think that Ethereum is here to stay but as a niche crypto which won't replace digital gold.

Litecoin is doing well compared to other altcoins. Mining is still profitable, and you can still mine it with your graphics card. Be warned that network effect could be in place when bitcoin goes mainstream, so there is low chance that litecoin will be as big as it predecessor.

Estimated growth of blockchain will be outrun by Moores law. In other words storage capability of average user will grow faster than the blockchain. In addition to that we can prune old transactions by using Merkle tree. 


Right now mining isn't profitable for that reason. Miners believe that the price of bitcoin will rise in the future or they aren't looking for huge returns but mine as a hobby. I see that as good thing. This creates greater network security and enforces somewhat self fulfilling prophecy.   


It is considered great risk to buy in long term.  Not many people goes by this strategy. True believers (including me)  buy long term and hope that they will never 'cash out' but buy goods and services when bitcoin gets more adoption. There's also people who buy short term either to speculate or simply buy stuff with it.  So you see there's plenty of incentive.   


I agree that this is concerning. Have in mind that technology is young and security will be better and more available to the average Joe.  For example there will be startups springing left and right dealing with our bitcoins like a bank. 


What are you suggesting is returning to old system that is irresponsible and expensive. Satoshi explicitly stated that bitcoin was invented to be chargeback free. That doesn't mean that consumer isn't protected.  Read about escrow services.

You just gave me an idea. Why not fund a video that will present bitcoin in such fashion. Setting will be, for example, standing party with a lot of people. Everyone is talking and there's a lot of noise. Camera will zoom into individual groups of people and you will hear that they are announcing transactions, as other people overhear them, they will pass it along. Narrator could periodically step in and explain what is happening at the moment. The analogous representation of Bitcoin protocol could be 'aha' moment for many people, thus could increase confidence in its robustness.

I wasn't saying all of those papers was for bitcoins. I invested to other altcoins as well. Besides that. You shouldn't keep your money in a single wallet, it's unsafe.  


[No analogy is ideal. Ever.](  


I was simply trying to illustrate how your argument is invalid by presenting you a analogous situation. The main difference here is that password to the inbox is stored on the server itself, not only just your head. The bitcoin "inbox" is also stored in the network, but excluding your password.   
  
*"... brainwallet refers to the concept of storing Bitcoins in one's own mind by memorization of a passphrase. As long as the passphrase is not recorded anywhere, the Bitcoins can be thought of as existing nowhere except in the mind of the holder."*  
I think this explanation is bad, but let's roll with it. They subtle thing about this is the words "thought of as". That doesn't mean that they literally exist nowhere except your mind, but practically they are inaccessible if you provide strong enough random string of words. You can test it by entering address of your supposedly nonexistent wallet to the blockchain.info website. How it knows about the transactions made by this wallet? Because wallets, transactions and bitcoins ARE the blockchain. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:36:03
I am well aware that cold storage exists, hell, I have few paper wallets myself. I also doesn't have anything against the term brain wallet, but from the technical standpoint it doesn't make any sense. All bitcoins, transactions, wallet addresses (that have been used) are recorded in the blockchain. The unrecorded portion are the keys to the wallets. So when you say "brain wallet" you're just referring to the seed used to generate specific wallet addresses (with corresponding keys ofc.). That doesn't mean that the coins are literally stored in your head.  
Also, no analogy is perfect so my comparison to email was not ideal. Calling argument stupid is not a valid rebuttal, but a fallacy.

They run servers 24/7, their employees need to get to work everyday, money itself needs to be transported, buildings needs electricity.  
Computers cracking SHA256 24/7 is the only and most efficient way to sustain such an idea. You see, when you don't do this you take an element of the equation, and every element in this system is vital. There's no other way to do this other than running different algorithm, and that doesn't change anything in terms of electricity. If banks could takeover bitcoin somehow (they can't) they would run computers also to crack those codes and secure network.
