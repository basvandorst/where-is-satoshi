A more stable currency always replaces the unstable one. In most countries fiat is more stable and untill btc can loose 10% value in an hour of manipulation people won't use it for groceries but for investment opportunity.
Don't get me wrong I am all for crypto, but at this point it's too easy to manipulate without any consequences.

The point is that it's useless trying to explain to everyone how blockchain works, most people don't care how it works and you don't need a technological background to see the future potential.

Sorry to hear that, but even my steam account is on 2FA at this point. Always lock down your phone.

More like a market stall. It's November...

So? Ofc they want to make money, its the whole point of the world. If they help the adoption of blockchain with it, why not?
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:58:53
Because everyone using a phone knows exactly how everything works in theirs and if needed can put one together and program the software right?

What if I told you that the whole idea is not having to sell it :)

Greed, thats why. When the next small jump happens people will fomo as they always did.

Not that simple, youtube is a platform for discovering new content. What you speak of is a site where you watch specific content that you already found.
Not the same. Far from it.

It promotes new channels to me all the time don't know what you are talking about. All these channels got popular on youtube and not on the outside like you said.
It does not work like that anymore. People endlessly scroll social media, the ones that don't already know about crypto. Focus on getting the mindless sheep out of their comfort bubble

The point is not to take a jackass that is on cocain and booze 24/7 and thinks he touched gods balls seriously for financial advice.
Whoever did is an idiot.

So thats how it is? It is excused to be an ass if the said person has more money than you? Good luck with life.

Then you were using windows wrong. I did not have to touch shit since I installed windows 10 3 years ago.

That is the part where you are wrong. When buying a laptop you have the choice of buying one with a removable battery, ram, disk. Don't blame anyone but yourself for not knowing exactly what you are buying.

Looking at my magic ball, I see the same.

Sure... most of them don't know even know what meme is. In the last 3 months I talked to 5 people who don't even know you can buy fraction of a coin and are turned away because they don't have 3,6k.   
  
They don't care about hodl as they have not heard of it.

What about the ability to repair it if it fails?
I am not talking about you taking it apart and repairing but apple themselfs refusing to repair their own stuff just to sell you more new things and blocking 3rd party repair shops with random lawsuits just to scare them off.
That is why I will never support apple, they think the device you buy is not yours and have no right to repair it if it breaks.

That is why you go with a asic resistant coin

So a dickeating 2020 year? :)
