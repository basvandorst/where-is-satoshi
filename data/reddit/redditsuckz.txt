isn't it strange literally reading any threads on here and all you see is positive posts about Blockstream? what possible reason could that be for? pick any post and any subreddit and you're never gonna see 100% of commenters agreeing on one thing
something feels eery about this place

you mean like SegWit?
then why are there angry hate mobs forming here and other social media platforms to try and denounce and 'shame' and put any businesses not using it on an "enemy of bitcoin list" 
that doesn't sound very opt-inny to me
in 12 years when LN launches its buggy beta, the same hate mobs will be rallying the troops to try and make "enemy of bitcoin" lists and commence a massive smear campaign. its all so very cypherpunky

It's weird how people define the term 'opt in' differently. Replace the word SegWit with sex and read it back to yourself.

well which part of 'opt in' is described by definition as "force it on everyone dont give them a choice"
because opt in means you can pick if you want it or not. that's what opt in means. whats with the pitch forks and cries about demonising businesses for making their choice and not opting in to run something they dont want to run?
the beauty of it is... if you dont agree with something in that implementation, you get a choice whether to run it or not.... Core doesnt even have segwit wallet in the gui, if they've had 2 years with the code ready to go... what have they been doing all this time ? twiddling their thumbs screaming at everyone else to get it ready when they havent bothered themselves?
great one m8
and yes, my analogy was right. with a chick she gets to opt in if she wants to bang you or not.... you cant just go "WELL, I STRONGLY FEEL YOU DONT HAVE A CHOICE AND YOU MUST DO IT"..... which is what lots of you are implying with segwit opt-in fork of bitcoin

what are most people into bitcoin for? its hardly majority libertarians anymore, its people wanting to get rich quick


quick, back to your digital gold store of value. cant afford fees to send anywhere. that type of utility?


you're not a programmer I can tell that already.


aka Blockstream and the venture capital funds

I'll take a fake Satoshi over a "I really fucking wish I was satoshi" Gregory Maxwell any day of the week
Nothing wrong with miners from any country. Ruling out a race of people based on their race would make you a ..... ?
and your pin up boy Charlie Shrem did jail time for actual crimes rather than just selling bird scaring fire works

just read the description on the github page


first of all 'experimental' and secondly 'instant payments to anyone'
the experiment was completed when Satoshi released it and it was proven to work perfectly. Instant payments ceased to exist when Blockstream had a hostile takeover of the bitcoin protocol.

that defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin being a peer to peer currency
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:06:48
you should have just created an IOU and used that instead of the ledger
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:56:40


miners dont matter. miners are evil

this is just a smear campaign by yet more crazy no2x retards because Voorhees speaks the truth and that upsets some of you
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:18:32
You never buy small items with a store of value digital gold
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:47:37
Well whatever they do expect extreme harassment from mostly either paid shills in here or just idiots. Harassing businesses surely is the best way forward??? Seems to have worked so far for you imbeciles
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:52:58
And so it begins. First cobra, now you....followed shortly by the other retards in charge before we know it the blocksize increase has consensus
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:08:58
Aren't they the enemy of bitcoin? The pitch forks in here and coercion, smear tactics and harassment of both coinbase CEO and coinbase staff members to threaten them into adopting an optional piece of software in their business which was approved and applauded by you all and now you're talking about using their services again. It's weird how you guys think these tactics are ok in life for any reason really. Shameful

Have entire family in a bed sit, owned a house and had no insurance... Still has time to create crypto wallet accounts and beg strangers for money on Reddit..... When life gives you lemons, such as not bothering with home and contents insurance, you become a man, get a job and get your family into reasonable housing... You don't join as many online hobby communities as possible with your hand out expecting money for nothing. Have some dignity and get on with it, everyone else has to.

Peter Todd employed people to launch massive ddos and other attacks on every competing open source fork... Go figure?
