it's definitely not inflationary - at least after 2140, and scarcity is what matters.  Ever feel like scaring the living shit out of a central banker?  just mutter the word ***scarcity*** and they will go berserk.
it's funny that people actually believe that prices going up isn't due to inflation and a deceptive system.  I can see why the public was hit with a barrage of misinformation about inflation ("It's a good thing!") recently.  Basically state sanctioned lieing/programming about what money and inflation are.
it could be called pseudo-deflationary (like existing gold without gold mining) when coins are lost due to negligence - after 2140, or if more are lost than gained from mining any time (although I'm not sure that would ever happen statistically)

Communicate, travel, use energy of any kind, what you see/hear, where you live, your vices and how you have fun....
then there's debt/inflation tax, on top of all that, for governmental "movement", which includes supposedly your descendants for hundreds if not thousands of years worth of phoney debt...
at first it's about security and fire departments, then it's about ***everything***
in this case if i want to do business/labor (which i rely on to survive) i can't continue without exchanging my goods for some worthless fiat to pay taxes with.
some people are being paid salary/wages/whatever in the same stuff, and probably buying food and board with it too
this is an attempt, like all the others, to introduce more friction to the system

and any time the experts, pundits, etc talk about bitcoin or cryptocurrency, they are in fact talking about the continuation of how your life will be run.  Money is an intimate and highly integrated part of everyone lives, and every time you become complacent in understanding what and how of money you throw your life away.

money is an extremely intimate part of our lives and controls us
I would say that they're "printing away our money" because everyone forgot that inflation is generally a bad thing, the lies are so thick that we can't even fathom why inflation is bad - and that is a far worse problem than inflation.
discouragement of intellectual traits is also a fucking shame nowadays, intentionally retarding everything down because it's cool to be (or at least act) stupid.

people need to wake the fuck up and realize that anyone who "fells like or wanes towards prohibition" is actually talking about ***your future***
money is an integral and intimate part of our lives, money runs us  these people think they got everything figured out and what money really is but in fact they are utterly diluted to begin with and the rest of what made up their mind was kindly provided by the "bankerstate"
if we aren't to trade in other human beings (and their suffering), then we should trade in our own philosophy (or math?)

even after the trillion dollar notes from Zimbabwe people still want government to provide funny monopoly fiat money
the problem isn't the government - it will always try to keep fiat as the only reigning supreme money of the land, its the way the people have allowed themselves to be diluted enough to use shit that isn't even classified as money, but rather some phony account and fake ass numbers just punched into a computer somewhere.  No, the problem is the people's complacency and "newthink" about what money and inflation really are, and how they completely ignore the fact that scarcity is ***the only thing*** that brings actual value.
