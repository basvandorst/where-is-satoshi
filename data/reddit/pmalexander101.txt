Damn. You clearly know Fiat economics better than me. You make some good points, and I am admittedly taking only the Econ view. Well done!

BTC obviously costs more than BCH, so BCH is cheaper. But BTC takes longer to move and has higher fees.

Don’t ask me to explain their logic. In a perfect world, they wouldn’t.

I will answer your question but I find it slightly demeaning that you are questioning my intelligence. 
For a while currencies were backed by precious metals (gold) held by the government. It’s what gave money value. Now they aren’t (I think they switched to the US’s credit in the 70s), but some countries still follow this principle. I am not saying BTC should back BCH, but rather one is hard to move and expensive, and the other is cheaper but easier to move. I understand how you could’ve misunderstood that part of what I said, but that’s when the comparison stops. That’s on me for not explaining.

Same. CNBC just can’t stop.

Great for the community, but also I guarantee this conversation will take place.
Me: Hi! Always great to meet a fellow cryptocurrency fan.
Random fake fan: You too!
Me: So what do you own?
Random fake fan: *sweats nervously*

Maybe like talking about bitcoin, and then raising money to buy crypto or go to conventions. Possibly working to inform people about crypto.

Pittsburgh area. Not a lot of conventions.
