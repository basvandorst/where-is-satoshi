I suppose that's possible, but they'd have to be selling one helluva stash to affect the price this drastically. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 13:40:30
If they want to mine with hardware someone else is paying for then they need to do one of two things: 
1. Refund the customer the amount of money mined with their miner. 
2. Offer a discounted rate on miners that will be used to mine for Avalon prior to being shipped. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:15:44
Yea, definitely avoid BFL. I recently got tired of waiting for them to deliver, and managed to get a refund through Paypal. 
I was then able to spend that money on a miner that's three times as powerful as the one I had originally ordered - even had a little money left over!
@_date: 2013-06-11 10:02:55
Yes, they will refund you if you cancel a preorder. Once the order ships, and the miner is in your hands it's yours, but they will give you a refund if they haven't shipped your order yet. 
There are a few other companies offering miners right now - check out  to see who has what for sale. The same rules I mentioned previously go for every one of these. Most of 'em are offering preorders, so be sure to find out their refund policies before making any purchases. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:06:27
I was actually intrigued by one of the positions they're offering but then I poked around their site and saw they're selling a bunch of BFL hardware, and they claim it's "In Stock" so this company is PROBABLY not on the up and up. Best to avoid working with them, or giving them your precious bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:23:37
I posted this a couple of days ago - sums the situation up fairly well. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:22:53
Will do. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:09:04
I'd invest it. The market may be volatile, but if you pay attention and execute trades strategically you could turn one bitcoin into two fairly quickly. 
@_date: 2013-07-08 13:48:44
It's also worth noting that BFL_Jody has been patting herself on the back a lil too hard. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:43:26
I used this method, and did receive a refund in less than a day. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 13:00:57
I'll give the same blanket answer here that I always give when confronted with this question: It depends. 
It depends on a bunch of stuff, first and foremost, it depends on your budget. If you have some significant amount of money to invest in your first miner (over $1k) then yea, there's the potential for profit there. 
It also depends on whether or not you have the physical space and mental dedication to persevere. The difficulty of mining bitcoins is always on the rise, and that's going to be doubly true with all the new ASIC miners that will be going online over the coming months. 
So if you have some serious money to dump on an ASIC miner, then sure, mining can be profitable. The best advice anyone can give you is to look at minr.info, see what you can afford, find out how long it'll take to get it, and then keep an eye on the difficulty and the price of a bitcoin. If those numbers slip outside of a range you're comfortable with based on the mining hardware you can afford, then bail out. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:47:35
Thanks for this. I used your method, and now BFL has ten days to either ship the miner or issue a refund. Either way I'm happy. 
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:12:18
That's not entirely true, but you do have to do a good deal of math before pulling the trigger on a purchase. 
I recommend using this calculator to play around with the numbers a bit to determine whether that miner you're thinking of buying will be profitable. 
The math gets more xomplex if you intend to use the BTC you mine to buy more miners. Suffice it to say a strong understanding of math will help anyone interested in mining bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:13:11
Thanks! I neglected to grab a screenshot while it was still up.

There are a handful of prominent reasons for a price drop like this. 
 Yes, panic selling is totally a legit reason for a price drop. I don't think it's the cause for this particular price drop, but yea, it happens. Panic selling is temporary, and nothing to worry too hard about. 
Drops like this happen when the market reacts to a particular piece of bad news. Reactionary drops (imo anyway) are distinct from panic drops in that they tend to be a little more long-lasting, and they tend to be based on concrete info rather than speculation. They can be temporary, or they can be long term depending on what news the market is reacting to. 
 Here's the one I think we're looking at right now - market manipulation. Bitcoin exchanges are not regulated by any sort of government agency meaning investors can use less-than-ethical trading practices to push the market value of a bitcoin up or down. I've noticed a trend over the past month or so where the price tends to dip on the weekends; I strongly suspect these fluctuations to be the direct result of market manipulation by investors with hefty amounts of cash invested in BTC. In the short term this isn't anything to worry about. In fact, if the trend continues, you may even be able to use some clever day trading to turn a tidy profit on situations like this. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:18:01
Again, I don't buy it - when they wanted my money they were happy to answer within 24 hours every time I emailed. In fact, I deliberately sent more emails than I needed to over a one week period to gauge the expediency of their email support system. Even in the beginning of last week when I emailed them to check in I received an answer the same day. It wasn't until Friday hit and I had heard nothing that they went dark on me. 
And what do you mean by "a lot" of miners? Do you have numbers? Witnesses? I've only seen a handful of people state publicly that they have received products from them, so unless you have data to back up your statement it's null and void. 
You might BELIEVE they are too busy and too awesome to get back to me, but I traffic in facts. I KNOW  how long it took them to answer me at the beginning of last week, and each time before that. I KNOW that their FAQ even states all miners ordered before September 23rd will ship the second week of October. I also KNOW that it's super easy to send an email blast to your customers letting them know something's wrong, and that they should expect delays. These are facts, and they paint a real bad picture for this company. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:43:19
It's actually fairly easy to avoid slander and libel suits; just stick to the facts. When you break away from the facts into opinion territory, or when you try to affix motivation to the things that are happening that's when you wander into slander territory.

I put together this list of bitcoin myths and explored the truth behind them. Please, send me more myths - I want to keep this article alive over time. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:03:26
It really blows my mind how little most people know about it. Every time I bring it up to my friends or family I get one of three responses. 
1. What's bitcoin? 
2. Is it legal? I heard it's just for drugs. 
3. Oh I know about bitcoin; it's a ponzi scheme. 
What people don't know about bitcoin could just about fill the grand canyon.

Sarcastic response: If you're Satoshi then send me some bitcoins! 1LcHik8TXTeLKhHZuK4GDQnsVQ51ZXZqkR
Sincere response in the unlikely event that this is legit: What are your thoughts on the current state of bitcoin mining? Did you anticipate the "arms race" that has sprung up in the mining community? 
@_date: 2013-10-15 00:21:34
Good point. I should have said "Given that they have at least delivered SOME products before a year passed by". 
@_date: 2013-06-24 01:52:25
no problem, glad to help. If you have any specific BTC questions feel free to shoot me a PM. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 17:38:26
No one should take ANY subreddit this seriously. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:37:14
haha, yea, an asicminer miner would pay itself off in like 200+ days, and that's only if the difficulty stayed the same. Based on the rate of increase in difficulty I'd be surprised if an asicminer miner ever paid itself off. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:11:49
So what you're saying is they're just too darn busy to answer my emails or ship my miner? I don't buy it. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:58:33
The best advice anyone can give you on this one is to put in a preorder, and keep an eye on the price of bitcoins and the difficulty rate. If those numbers reach a point where the 5GH/S miner no longer seems worth it to you, cancel the preorder. 
Any new orders placed with BFL now won't ship for at least two months. I've seen estimates that put the difficulty rate at around 65mil by mid July If that number turns out to be accurate the 5GH/S miner would get you approximately $144 per month at the current USD price of a bitcoin. 
This is only an estimate. In fact, there's absolutely no way to say for certain what the difficulty will be, nor is there a way to accurately predict the value of a BTC in two month's time. Also, given BFL's track record, there's no way to say FOR SURE that your miner will definitely show up in two month's time. 
So basically my advice is to place the preorder, and pay attention to what's going on with bitcoins. You can always get a refund before the miner ships out if the difficult and price of a BTC slip out of a range you feel is worth your while. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 00:38:27
I did it a few days ago. Took about a half hour on the phone with Paypal, but in the end they were able to get the dispute bumped up to a claim giving BFL ten days to respond with a tracking number or a refund. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:36:49
Frustrated as I am with them, I'd probably still buy a BFL rap album. Thanks for catching the typo!
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:16:29
Dwolla is kind of inconvenient - takes days to get money into it, and days to get money out of it. It also takes time for transactions from one user to another to clear. The only reason I was using it was to move money to Bitcoin exchanges.... so I guess I'm not much of a Dwolla customer anymore.
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:14:06
haha, they've taken a really aggressive stance on forum posts. After I posted my imagining of a convo between BFL and their customers (no swearing, polite post, followed all rules) my account was locked so that all new posts I make get blackholed - it says they'll show after a moderator looks at them, but nothing ever shows up, no matter how simple and potentially non-damaging to BFL it is. 
So I used the instructions to get a refund rolling. BFL now has about a week to either ship my LS or give me a refund. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 01:26:40
On the one hand, bitcoins haven't reached a high level of adoption yet. That means you can't just walk into Walmart with your bitcoins and walk out with three $5 pairs of jeans, a giant-ass box of cereal and a new DVD player. 
On the other hand, bitcoins ARE used in all the same ways currency is. You can buy things with BTC at sites like bitcoinstore.com or use them to get gift cards with Gyft. 
I'm a freelance writer professionally, and I am totally willing to accept BTC as monetary compensation for my work, and that has everything to do with all of the various methods available to me for spending BTC or converting them to USD. 
So I guess my advice would be to err on the side of caution; treat bitcoins as currency when it comes to the rules and restrictions you put on them. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:06:15
I'll give you the same advice I give everyone who asks me this question. If you think you want to get into asic mining, place your preorder now, and pay close attention to the difficulty and the price of a bitcoin. Use this calculator to determine the monthly yield of your miner(s) 
If that calculator ever tells you it'll take more than a couple of months for the miner(s) you have preordered to pay themselves off, cancel the order, and invest that money elsewhere. 
Unfortunately, neither I nor anyone else can give you anything more concrete. It's totally possible to make estimates about the difficulty, but we really won't know for sure until it happens. As ASIC's come in GPU's go out, and predicting the rate at which those things happen is 
That being said, the estimate I've been working off of is that the difficulty will hit about 65mil by mid July. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 17:34:41
I used this process, and was able to get a Paypal claim filed. BFL has until the 23rd to either ship my miner or give my money back. Either way I'm happy. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:03:05
A big no-no? Nah - Bitcoin users are like any other group of people on the internet; some of 'em are gonna give you helpful advice, and some of 'em are just gonna slam you for being new and not automagically knowing everything there is to know. If you've got any other newb questions just let me know. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 17:23:06
Got the info from a couple of you guys now - thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:35:01
Just to be clear, I'm not a fan of Paypal. I use them because they're a workplace necessity for a freelancer (most of my clients pay that way). In this particular situation the two payment methods accepted were Paypal and BTC. Unfortunately, Paypal is the better choice this time. 
I really hope more escrow services pop up, and start getting widely implemented. I love Bitcoins, and I want to see the currency thrive, but with companies scamming users out of their btc it'll never really gain widespread adoption without some sort of security measure in place. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 13:37:20
I'll give you a serious answer since everyone else here just seems interested in bashing BFL. I mean, that bashing is justified to a certain extent, but it's probably not very helpful to you. 
A couple weeks back BFL stated they intended to have their order backlog wiped out within 90 days. That would put new orders shipping sometime in August. 
Remember all that bashing I mentioned above? Yea, that's because BFL has failed to meet any of their shipping dates over the past year. This time it's a little different - you can look at their blog and see that they're actually shipping units and receiving parts to make more units. 
So will you ACTUALLY get your miner in August? I can't say for sure, but based on the rate at which they're shipping I'd say it's possible. It's probably more likely you'll get your miner in September or October, but hey a little optimism never hurt anything. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:17:49
If you pre ordered from BFL and would like a refund I'd strongly recommend contacting Paypal (assuming you used them) and explain the situation. Paypal almost always sides with the buyer. 
If you purchased with BTC, well, you've really only got two choices; wait and see if they provide a product in a reasonable time, or contact the FTC about it. 
If enough complaints come in through both these methods it will make significant trouble for BFL. That trouble will very likely result in a reversal of this policy.

It takes a loooooooooooong time for QT to index the blockchain when you fire it up for the first time. It varies, but it can take anywhere from hours to days depending on your hardware, and how long you let it run for. I'd recommend leaving the computer on with QT open for a couple of days to see if it catches up. If not, the crash may have caused a problem, and it might be a good idea to uninstall and reinstall QT. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 15:49:34

@_date: 2013-06-21 20:30:52
As someone who previously worked repairing computers, I'd say you may be jumping the gun by primarily dealing in BTC. Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-bitcoin, but the bulk of customers looking to get a computer repaired are, generally speaking, less tech savvy, and as a result, less likely to know what a bitcoin is and how to spend them. 
You may want to consider taking other payment methods, but incentivising your customers to use bitcoins by offering a discount for btc users. 
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:54:04
Agreed. Every time a company that handles bitcoins breaks the law / fails to comply with regulations I see a bunch of posts on Reddit and news stories on various sites crying doom and gloom for bitcoins, but the fact is the US hasn't expressed any direct disdain for BTC. Companies that aren't legally compliant will run into trouble with the government regardless of which currencies they transact in. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:59:11
I work as a freelance writer, and I'm letting all of my clients know that I do accept bitcoin. If  you have a marketable skill, let people know you'll work for bitcoin and see what happens - you might not get a lot of responses, but hey, at least you're raising public awareness just by asking. 
You're probably not going to get a job that pays in BTC, but you could definitely get a few part time / one off gigs that will pay out in bitcoins. 
Don't forget the other end of it - spend those coins once you get them. Right now, bitcoin is a deflationary currency, meaning that while it can be exchanged for goods and services the primary value people see in it is as an investment tool. In the long run this could be damaging to bitcoin, so it's important for bitcoin enthusiasts to spend those coins! Between bitcoin store, bitspend, and gyft you shouldn't have any trouble using your coins.

You know, I generally like Bill Maher, but man, if he doesn't understand something he sure has no problem belittling it. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:12:53
This is gross. I've been skeptical about my BFL order since I placed it, but I felt reassured by the knowledge that I could always get my money back if things got to a point where I felt the miner I ordered was no longer worth the money. Now I don't have that assurance. 
It also looks really bad for BFL. They aren't shipping product very quickly AT ALL, but they're working on new products, and taking orders for stand alone chips. It's beginning to look like they've decided to dip into the preorder money to keep their company afloat, and that's not OK. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 00:05:03
First, it's taking BFL well over a week to answer support questions, so don't panic there. The thing you should be panicking about on that front is that they don't seem to be voluntarily issuing refunds anymore if their forums are to be believed (their forums are full of angry dodgy people so take it with a grain of salt).
Second, try actually contacting Paypal by phone or email. Explain the situation in detail. They may be more helpful that way as opposed to using their automated system. 
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:41:00
I like the spirit of the message - bitcoin doesn't have any sort of centralized banking system behind it, making it less prone to the types of manipulation that have ruined the US economy. 
The spirit is good, but the plan isn't. 2014 is too soon. Realistically, that's not enough time for employers to start issuing paychecks in bitcoin, and until that happens it just won't be possible to abandon the existing banking system. 
Still, the idea of a future where bitcoin is the primary currency is appealing!
@_date: 2013-06-26 14:40:06
There's a difference between a sale and a preorder. If I order a miner, get the miner, and decide I no longer want the miner, that sale is final I have exchanged money for a product with the knowledge that the sale is final. 
If I preorder a product, and don't receive it for months (approaching a year for some people) and decide I don't want it I haven't yet exchanged money for a product; I've put my money down but I haven't received a product. In other words, and actual sale didn't take place as I never got anything for my money. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:01:35
Even if they didn't they're doing the community a favor, and that deserves an appropriate level of respect, which (IMO anyway) would definitely include not dropping their email addresses all over the internet. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 13:29:15
at $3300 AUD I'd say skip it - there are other, cheaper options out there, and your price per GH/S means you may never actually turn a profit on that miner (depending on how rapidly difficulty actually rises, and what happens to the price of BTC). 
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:26:43
I posted this as part of a reply to Josh on their forums, but I feel like it has a place here in this thread too, so here's my imagining of the conversation between BFL and their customers over the past year or so. 
BFL: "Hey guys, we're selling these rad miners! They'll be out in a few months, so order today!!"
Customers: "Hooray for rad miners! Here, take my money!"
BFL: "Thanks for the money! Hey, bt dubs, we were wrong; it's gonna be a few more months before we ship anything." 
Customers: "That's OK, stuff happens."
BFL: "I'm glad you feel that way because it happened again; it'll be 2013 before you get your product."
Customers: "Well that's kind of a raw deal, but we've waited this long, so I guess we'll stick it out."
BFL:"Hey guys, I know this is a bummer, but you're gonna have to wait a little longer. You should have your stuff by April though!"
Customers: "Seriously? Well as long as the difficulty doesn't spike I gues I could wait...."
BFL: "Did I say April? I meant July. You'll have your miners in July."
Customers: "Oh come on now, this is getting silly."
BFL: "Did I say July? I meant August."
Customers: "Well then why did you say July?"
BFL: "I ACTUALLY meant September; sorry 'bout that." 
Customers: "You monster! Stop lying to me!!"
BFL: "Did I say September I meant..."
Customers: "SHUT UP JUST SHUT UP RIGHT NOW YOU FILTHY THIEF YOU STOLE MY MONEY!! SHIP MY PRODUCT OR GIVE ME A REFUND"
BFL: "Refunds? Nah, that's not happening. All sales are final."
Customers: "But you haven't sold us anything; you just took our money and then left us hanging for over a year! How do you sleep at night???"
BFL: "On a really nice bed! Wanna buy our new product? It'll start shipping in a couple of months!"
