I posted under that group with the title "**Unable to access 30 Bitcoins and 3BCH"**
It was accepted as a post 17 hours after I initially submitted it. I submitted it over an hour before I posted it to bitcoin reddit. I find it odd that it has had nowhere near the amount of response from your support team over there than it has done here.
I find it strange that no one from your mods etc has seen it, as there doesn't seem to be many new posts at all on that group.
Here is the link: [

Okay well I am here now, how shall we go ahead?
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:31:54
Thank you for spending well over an hour trying to assist me but so far we have not achieved access. Hopefully we can try again later.

Tried mutliple wallets without success.

You have someone masquerading as a jaxx support team member named jaxxdaniel who is the only one to reply to me on that thread. He has just attempted to get me to hand over my BIP32 Root Key.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:21:27
I have received a private message from jaxx_andrei who is in charge of CS, stating he is unaware of who this user is.

I tried it in coinomi and nothing. Zero balance. Jaxx so far has given me one response to my initial support request, and after emailing them back I haven't received a response for around 24 hours.
They suggested I used the  Ian's tool here [ to generate all the addresses to match them with the one I sent the bitcoins to, I generated around 20,000 addresses and not a single one matches where I sent the payment to.  
It could not have been some incorrect address, because the address was directly off the Jaxx app, on an iOs device.

Yeah I'm not a novice to this but this is good advice for everyone.
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:21:31
No unfortunately not. Jaxx has offered me no support apart from the initial email which looks like a generic ready prepared email so I am assuming there have been others who have faced this exact same glitch caused by the app.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:23:54
I am using the "Account Extended Public Key" as per the bip39 tool
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:27:25
Right now I'm 30 bitcoins and 3BCH down. That's a serious amount of cash for anyone to consider. Any tip would have to be paid on a successful recovery of the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:25:21
Different keys for different coins, sure.
For bitcoin there is only one xPub.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:35:52
FYI The BIP39 derivation path for BITCOIN on the IanColeman tool are the same as the ones used by the Jaxx wallet. BIP44.
Therefore when I check the xPub key generated from this on the blockchain, and the balance shows zero, the logical conclusion reached is that this wallet is not associated with the one I sent bitcoins to.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:33:35
FYI Jaxx Subreddit refused to accept my post yesterday. Seems like they are heavily restricting the amount of support request posted on their support group.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:28:15
Yes and I have never shared any sensitive wallet information with anyone. I am the only one to possess the passphrase generated by the JAXX app.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:38:24
The fact is of the situation is two fold.
1) I wrote down the exact passphrase as shown to me by the Jaxx app on my apple ipad. This is not a jailbroken device.
2) Payment was sent to the exact address shown on the Jaxx app.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:21:32
I wrote down the exact phrase the Jaxx app provided me. There's no two ways about it, this is a large amount of bitcoins and I noted it down word for word as per the Jaxx app. The address I sent payment to was the one displayed on the app. The backup passphrase was also displayed by the app. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:05:36
Someone masquerading as a JAXX support team member named "jaxxdaniel" who is the only one to reply to me on the thread I posted on the JAXX support reddit: [ has just attempted to get me to hand over my BIP32 Root Key.
When used in iancolemans tool, the bip32 root key generates public and private keys, just like the passphrase.
@_date: 2018-07-17 03:19:16
Yes that is my thoughts exactly; the Jaxx app has given me a passphrase which does not in any way relate to the bitcoin and bch address it was giving me.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:00:50
I'll wait for a few more opinions from some credible redditors. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:30:35
I have compared every single word of my passphrase with the BIPS word list: [ and there is not a single word which comes close to having an alternative closely matching with the words of my passphrase.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:11:05
No that's not what I am saying at all. All the words from my backup phrase can be found in that list. The passphrase is exactly as per what was given to me on the JAXX app. However there is no words that come even close to an ALTERNATIVE match.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:22:41
This was on a apple iPad which had never been jailbroken. All updates were done wirelessly, from the apple store / apple servers. There is no chance that this was a compromised device as it had been purchased new from the store. The fact of the situation is the Jaxx app has given me a passphrase which is now not giving me my balance.
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:47:00
Thank you, but this is not an answer to my question.
Simply put, does the xPub key display the total balance of the wallet when checked in blockchain?
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:10:39
I have replied to you and said that I have used the BIP39 Key editor to generate the wallet seed. There is no balance on the entire backup, but my bitcoins are sitting exactly where I sent them.  
I replied to you last night and have not received any email response.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:13:10
Seriously, this is 30 bitcoins we are talking about. I noted down the exact phrase as was shown by the app. Theres no two ways about it.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:21:41
What I think does not matter, only the facts matter.
@_date: 2018-07-18 12:24:01
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:11:06
No this wallet has no sync feature.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:23:39
I had purchased a hardware wallet for transferring the bitcoins to. But the passphrase is not giving me any balance.
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:42:00
I did a test transfer. The 30 BTC were transferred in 3 lots. First a test transfer followed by the remainder in 2 lots.
