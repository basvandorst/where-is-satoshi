Serious question, what do you really do with the bitcoins? Do you convert to fiat or just store them?

Yeah, it's showing 0 on everything but in Breadwallet.

Yes, I triple checked. I put in my 12 word phrase to get my bip32 pub key and put it in the blockchain. I also used the same phrase on multiple bip39 supporting wallets and all show up as 0. Only Multibit showed my transactions and showed the my funds as unconfirmed.

I converted the phrases to a private key and reimported to several wallets and it showed as 0 btc.

I used the converted pub key not phrases. I used the search.

I got my extended pub key and blockchain.info is even showing 0 transactions and 0 btc...

It's BIP39, even BW rep said so.

Sure thing, I emailed BW and they said the custom miner fee should be out soon so hopefully that'll fix it.

I did switch over to Android, will the update be going on there too? 
I tried importing to a desktop wallet (can't remember which one) but it didn't work.
@_date: 2017-07-06 02:24:34
I'll try it out and see if it works.

I did have a lot of small transactions and support said that they can't allow me to modify network fee. They suggested that I import the wallet to another client but I was not able to get it to work successfully.

Thanks! Hopefully update comes soon.
