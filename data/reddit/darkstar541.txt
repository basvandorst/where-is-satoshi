Trust, but verify. This community has to be based on trust, and there is nothing wrong with a "hey I set up an electronics store to promote Bitcoins by taking it as payment!" post, but making up a story with a new account posing as an impartial customer is a dishonest way of promoting yourself.
Why would a regular Bitcoin community member create a throwaway to promote a business? Occam's Razor, buddy.

Unfortunately too many people and businesses seem to be waiting for the government's "blessing" before getting into Bitcoin. Talk about an oppressive atmosphere that stifles innovation, even if it is just a misconception, it's already there and taken root.

If my electricity bill was $195.58 for the month of Dec for 1668 kWh, and mining was 211.2 kWh of that (12.66%), then my electricity costs would be $24.76, right? So then my profit mining would have been $188.97 (total value mined) less electricity ($24.76), which would be $164.21, of which I cashed out $130.40 of that into an Amazon gift card.  How do I (or do I) deal with the rest I didn't cash out? Worry about it next year?

I'm wondering what information I need to bring my accountant so she has all the facts.

What seized drugs are sold back to the public?
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:16:08
Chemically, yes, but not in terms of how the federal or state governments regulate it.

Is this thinking along the right lines?

I'm not really familiar with FB coins, but it appears to be an "e-currency" like Microsoft points or Bioware coins, etc. that is centrally managed (by the company providing it) and directly converted from fiat into e-currency to use only in the company's walled garden store.  There are probably limitations in terms of giving it to others (reduces the likelihood of money laundering).  In that sense, it's not much different than gift card credit.
I would imagine that is a lot more benign than a crypto-"currency" that is designed to be decentralized, anonymous, and a complete replacement for fiat for transactions everywhere.

why not just report realization events (from the miner--not investor-- perspective)? IE on date X, i exchanged .1779 BTC for a power supply with a fair market value of $125 on that date, so i count it as $125 of income.
Serious question, as i never plan to buy bitcoin, just mine alt coins as additional income.

Thoughts on someone who does nothing but mine (none of the buying low/selling high) and including realization events (i.e. converting Bitcoin into Amazon gift certificates) as the "income"? This saves me from having to keep a daily log of how much I mined, what Bitcoin was worth that day, and then tracking gains/losses until I cash out into gift certificates or fiat.
The only concern I can think of would be possible tax evasion, if I avoid cashing out and building up a big unexchanged balance of Bitcoin, but as long as I am consistently cashing out what I have earned via mining, would they have a problem with this?
Supposing I do that, I would just add the total of what I converted from BTC to USD (cash or gift card) to the amount on my W-2 for total taxable income--right?

You need miners for your pool?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:46:30
I guess i am still trying to wrap my head around how this has to be calculated on a daily basis. I was planning to count only "realization events" (basically exchanging the crypto for something that has a fair market value--a good/service like the Amazon gift card) as income/earned, and then deduct the electricity it cost to produce the BTC I exchanged for it as a cost.

What is Vaultoro?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:30:05
Well, I am not sure I am doing it right... which is why I came here, to see how other miners are keeping their records or what they are giving their accountants.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:55:18
So it gets double-taxed?  Can you elaborate?

pls overstoke
@_date: 2014-02-08 04:59:41
I would like to know this too.  As someone who mines, I'd prefer to just report as additional income, and only count realization events (periodically converting my BTC balance mined into Amazon gift cards for use), which makes it simple to determine how much the BTC is "worth" (the flat amount of the gift card).  Thoughts on that strategy?
