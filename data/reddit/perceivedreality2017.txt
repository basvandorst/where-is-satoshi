Capitalization will eventually cause even large holders to sell.  Ever heard the saying everyone has their price?  At what point would you start selling?  I'm selling when i can pay off my mortgage with one bitcoin.

Not true at all as more capital comes in and the price rises large holders will sell larger and larger portions to diversify their portfolio.  Sure that might take a long time but it will happen.

I'm sorry but you are simply failing to see the fundamental effect that market Cap/price will have on trading.  You cannot separate price from market cap on a currency with such a limited supply.  At a market cap of $69 Billion and price of $4150 BTC can get pushed around.  Eventually as the Price/Cap rises the amount of capitol needed to push it around also grows.  If BTC continues to grow eventually it will get to a point even that even the top 1% using leverage won't be able to swing the price very much.  Even if you believe this is a big bubble you really have to consider the effect of fiat capitol and very cheap money allowing the majority of these traders to capitalize in the first place.  There is obviously fundamental investment in Bitcoin it is just masked by traders and speculation currently.

I have a fairly good amount of US cash in a savings account.  last month i received about $5 interest by allowing the bank to multiply it 10x out of thin air then loan that amount to other borrowers at about 700% more than they are paying me for the use of my money.   A failed currency is one in which the value of the currency does not keep up with the inflation of the goods and services it can purchase.  NO 100 million would not be a failure.  I don't know at what amount this currency will stabilize but we are a long way from that for sure.

Definition: Quantitative easing is a massive expansion of the open market operations of a central bank. It’s used to stimulate the economy by making it easier for businesses to borrow money. The bank buys securities from its member banks to add liquidity to capital markets. This has the same effect as increasing the money supply. In return, it the central bank issues credit to the banks' reserves to buy the securities.
Where do central banks get the credit to purchase these assets? They simply create it out of thin air. Only central banks have this unique power. This is what people are referring to when they talk about the Federal Reserve “printing money.”

What about QE doesn't make sense?  Really?  QE is nothing more than producing debt to solve a problem caused by default on debt.   Talk about half baked!  The fed's balance sheet will be unwound.  Sure its that simple.  Nothing to see here folks move along, these guys have it all under control.

Capitalism in this country died in the early 70's when Nixon killed the gold standard.  In my response Blockchain and Bitcoin are synonymous.  While technically that is not true the real future of sound currency i believe will reveal itself in the very near future as either Bitcoin or a very close descendant.

That is exactly the way i feel.  Had i started researching bitcoin the first time i heard about it i would have probably retired by now.  At 45 years old i have been scratching my head for years wondering how the economy is still able to function with the current levels of manipulation and corruption.  This isn't about getting rich or making money quick in my opinion.  Even though obviously there are many people in it for that reason.  This is nothing short of an economic revolution unlike the world has ever seen.

Do you allow for any difference between speculation and investing or saving in your bubble assumption?  You can trade all day everyday and constantly manipulate the daily value.  Meanwhile people who really learn about bitcoin are constantly putting away a little each month.  Speculation merely creates buying opportunities.  That is why the constant trend will remain upward. At the very least until something better comes along.  People with money are not stupid they understand that every asset class right now is in a bubble because of monetary policy.   Yes that includes Bitcoin however the bubble part is the top few percentage not the underlying investment amount.
