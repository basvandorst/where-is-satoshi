In the corporate world dealing with customer support, every customer is equal. Therefore everyone will wait their turn. Once their turn comes, if it's important enough, then it will be escalated. But you can't prioritize your issue if you're at the end of the line. We're dealing with money here that is meant to be invested. That is not urgent no matter what argument you think of. If you needed the money to spend, you shouldn't have invested in the first place. 
Just because your money is "missing" doesn't mean you lost it. It's in the hands of an FDIC insured company, who have to backcheck large orders to make sure you're not doing something illegal. Why? Because Coinbase would get fined by the government. So they're covering their ass by investigating all these money wires, one at a time. And there are thousands of these issues to work through. Think about logistics, people.

If you're using Electrum, please make sure you're using the most up to date version and check out the recent sticky on the front page of this sub. All old versions have a vulnerability where random websites can have direct access to your BTC and steal it. 
Here's the thread for you and anyone else reading:

However in our current state of tech, I wouldn't be comfortable completely switching over to Bitcoin for everything. I like that to be a possibility in the future, of course, but right now we have to deal with fiat.

To clarify: say Person A buys a bitcoin for $16k USD, this is from Person B who is selling a bitcoin for that much. They both use Coinbase for their exchange. The transaction ends up with Person A buying from Person B. In reality, though, it's more complex as order sizes can range. So for an exchange to match an order they collect funds used for a purchase from Persons A, B, C, D, E and use the bitcoins that Person F and G are selling. This combination is one among many thousands each minute (assuming high volume that day)

$8k is a serious discount, I'd buy actual coins at that point instead of fractions.

I literally owned 0.1BTC two weeks ago, now it would be worth the value of 0.2 technically.

That's the relative value to USD, the price against BTC is important too. Right now it's about 18 million Satoshi, or 0.018 BTC

Yup, it's just from the sale of Bitcoin into other alt coins. Liquidity among all cryptos is healthy for the economy. Keep in mind that 99% of people still have no clue what this is so there is no shortage of new money coming into play. HODL your Bitcoin (and other cryptos too) and be patient.

That's because those who accept the handouts just take from the localized pot and don't contribute back into it. Instead of an endless cycle of money coming and going, it's just a system of money going and not coming back.

Tech sector is down on the real Stock Market so buying on the dip is an excellent idea. Of course that isn't crypto so this thread isn't the right place to mention it. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 21:17:51
In a messed up way, I agree. The scammers would need people to send crypto to them, which creates transactions. Then when the scammers eventually sell and cash out to fiat, that's another set of transactions.

Human nature is amazing, isn't it? We make the same routine movements over and over and never learn. During a bubble's insane growth, the bulls always think "Wow this is incredible and I'm making so much money! This will go on forever" While totally ignoring the unsustainable growth because they are so focused on the greed and money. They lose touch with risks and the bearish factors looking right at them. Look at half the comments in this thread, it's very concerning to see. 
Now this doesn't mean I hate Bitcoin. I just can't be ignorant to the hyperinflated price and overvaluation. I'd be a hypocrite because I admit I did profit off this inflation. Just want to remind all to be cautious or you'll probably get burned in the next big drop.

Well the community has come akin to making HODL an acronym such as that, but the origin of hodl is simply from a typo. 
The above link is the original thread where the hodl meme arose from. Important to note that OP was drunk, hence the bad spelling.

At the most basic level, demand for cash has outpaced supply. People/businesses need to borrow cash but banks don't have the money aka liquidity to lend. So the banks have to borrow money from the central banks. And so on til the top: the FED. Printing money devalues the currency slightly, but they may think it's worth it to keep the economy going. 
My guess is that also in relation to the inverted yield curve news going around, many people are trying to cash out their short term bonds but the banks don't have ample cash to payout the interest because it's a short term maturity. 
Events like this are bandaids to inevitable recessions in the economy.
