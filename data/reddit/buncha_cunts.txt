That phrase applies to trying to buy in on a price that is plummeting when you don't know where it will stop or if it will go back up again.

DJI obviously rules the marketplace with drones and for good reason. Doesn't look like I'll ever break even on that investment again.

I still don't think it's safe to share a key between your phone and your cold storage. If someone gets into my phone wallet somehow they could get the seed words to my entire savings.

Here's how I have imagined blockchain technology changing our lives in a far off future. For fun let's say it's 2140, all Bitcoin have been mined and all that's left is transaction fees.
Autonomous robots are capable of doing nearly all jobs humans were once capable of, 24 hours a day at maximum efficiency. Humans become more and more costly to employ. The only place humans can still sort of excel is being creative.
As well as all financial transactions being handled via blockchain, all data transmissions between autonomous robots will be handled over the blockchain. The robots will use the blockchain to make sure all other robots are in agreement about their tasks and none of them can go rogue.
Our jobs as humans becomes making sure our highly efficient solar rooftops are powering our highly efficient blockchain mining machines, which keep the order of the entire world's finances and manufacturing.
Literally your only job could be to make sure your personal mining machine is plugged in and connected to the internet until it dies and gets replaced. For doing this you are rewarded your Universal Basic Income...from there you have incredible freedom to do other things you truly enjoy to obtain more wealth if you so please.

The use of “buck” to mean “money” came about, as one might expect, from the days when a deerskin was a common medium of exchange. The term appears as early as 1748 in the journal of Conrad Weiser, who wrote, while traveling through Indian territory (in what is now Ohio) in 1748, “He has been robbed of the value of 300 Bucks.” A hundred years later, with the deerskin no longer a significant unit of trade, use of the word “buck” had shifted to a more general reference to the dollar.

The fees are not exaggerated. I think some people don’t understand that if you have a bunch of transactions coming into your account, all those have to be verified with the next outgoing transaction. So you can end up with a situation where a miner like me who just bought a hardware wallet has to pay $175 to move $2500 because it accumulated in my wallet over multiple payouts.
This doesn’t even begin to address the fact that the “flippening” attacks from the Bcash folks seem to be working...and that’s not exactly a good look.

I'm really confused why everyone is talking about miners. Miners don't have anything to do with the mempool. They don't spam the network because mining has nothing to do with adding transactions to the mempool. 
There will always be one block processed every 10 minutes. Even if there is only one person in the whole world mining, the difficulty rate will adjust so that it takes them 10 minutes to mine a block.
Miners don't hurt the network when they stop mining, they just help out all the other miners.

Someone the other day posted an account that had spent multiple bitcoins in transaction fees just sending bitcoin to the same address it was coming from. As a miner myself I have trouble seeing how this would be profitable, but I guess if you could get the transaction fees high enough and had a large enough mining farm it could be. 
Thing is the ultra low transaction fees aren't really doing much to spam the mempool, they just stick around the longest. To really congest the network you'd have to spam transactions with higher and higher fees to give your spam transactions priority. This way those lower fee transactions never confirmed and everyone else also has to pay higher and higher fees to get their transactions through. I think it takes a lot more money than you think.

Maybe I should have taken a screen shot, but after hours of being stuck at 0% confirmed, or maybe showing 40% and then going back to 0%, the money gets returned to my wallet and I get a notification in Bread wallet saying "Transaction Rejected"
I actually tried to pay my babysitter in Bitcoin last night because she was interested and wanted to see how it worked... paid $7 to send her $50, and then it got returned to me. So I ended up having to pay $16 through Coinbase. Why the hell should anyone ever have to pay 5x a gas station ATM fee to send $50? Wasn't the whole selling point of Bitcoin in the early days that you could send money around for *cheaper* than the banks allowed? Shit I could probably mail cash to the other side of the world for $16.

Right...Lightning, Lightning, Lightning is all anyone can say. But optimistic estimates say we'll see that in 6 months. Then everyone has to adopt it. So 6 months even in a pie-in-the-sky perfect scenario where the developers finish testing and rolling out ASAP and all the major players like Coinbase adopt it immediately. Reality is, we're still waiting for Segwit to really be adopted and it's been 6 months. You've seen how much can change in another 6 months right? That's way more than enough time for BTC and BCH to flip values.

How exactly is a Segwit transaction possible if you have no access to a Segwit-capable wallet? Right now the options are 
- spend a bunch of money on transaction fees
or 
- spend a bunch of money on a hardware wallet, then a bunch of money on transaction fees to move your money to the Segwit address, THEN finally you can benefit from Segwit

Bitcoin does have a staff, sort of, but they aren't paid by bitcoin per se, unlike some other cryptocurrencies have built in. In theory anybody with the knowledge of the code and how to potentially improve it could download the code and work on it themselves, and depending on permissions, even push a detailed overview of their changes to other developers for them to look at and analyze for bugs. It's really a very democratic way of doing things with the most qualified people always able to step up to the plate. That it what being open source is about at the core.

Guys...let's be real here. Reasonably priced transactions are now impossible. Something needs to be done.
I can't even transfer my money from my Bread wallet into my hardware storage anymore. Even the high fee transactions are getting rejected. I tried to pay over $100 in fees to move $2500 and it got rejected. WTF.
If this keeps up I'm sorry but BCH is going to overtake BTC. What use is a currency that can't actually be transacted? Why should we have to pay $100 to move a couple thousand? When banks are doing it better isn't Bitcoin fundamentally broken?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:10:21
Agreed. Still doesn't fix the problem of numerous wallets having bitcoin trapped in them because the cost to move it is more then the bitcoin is worth.

That's as far as I've thought it out so far but I think it is the most feasible application of Universal Basic Income. The idea of getting money for doing absolutely nothing sounds ridiculous even in a post-labor utopia. But if you actually have some simple task to maintain your miner, which is a tiny part of a huge decentralized society, in order to get your UBI via transaction fees - I think that's a little more fair. You could even choose to use your UBI to buy more miners if you were up to maintaining them.
People could focus more on ideas. We'd have time and money to enjoy things like art and music and hand crafted things even more, so we could profit off those to supplement our UBI. I imagine hand crafted goods will become quite a novelty in a world where machines create everything. Kind of already are.
I guess if we had robots creating new robots, we'd need a way to make sure a robot couldn't somehow be created off-chain. In theory "Create off-chain robot" could be considered a rogue task. I think blockchain could really be cool for decentralizing robot brains and I don't know if I've heard anybody talk about that application before.
I guess instead of one brain doing one task at a time, you'd have like a BLOCKBRAIN. 
(Holy fuck, coming up with this as I go right now) 
So the blockbrain would track every ongoing task of every robot on the planet as a decentralized brain...and we'd ALL take part, both robot and human (miner), in making sure every part of the brain could think and make decisions without straying from the will of the larger blockbrain.
Does this sound kinda cool or am I just stoned?

It's not instantaneous though. It still can take 24 hours. And the entire point of bitcoin was to rival the banks efficiency, not match it.
At the end of the day, if it costs me more to send someone $500 than it would for me to go to a pricy ATM at a gas station, get out $500 cash, and mail it to them, then Bitcoin is fundamentally broken. You could probably even overnight mail it and only pay a few extra bucks.

You're saying all the exact same stuff someone else said when they posted this guy's tweets and were shown how this could be faked. "Why would he fake it? What would he get out of it?" etc.
The fact that you and the other poster are both using damn near the same exact arguments when faced with the reality this could be faked is suspicious to me.

Was the dotcom bubble truly exponential? Was the tulip bubble truly exponential? What are you getting at then? Is this different or is it the same? All I was implying was that the price of bitcoin is closer to the rapid adoption of new technologies than of a speculative bubble.
Could it be that it's not actually an exponential curve but the beginning of a logarithmic s-curve that will stabilize as we reach a point of heavy adoption and circulation of the currency?

I agree somewhat, because it can get confusing if people only know about Bitcoin, but I also think it's good to make people aware that crypto is a whole new emerging asset class and there are a lot of different things going on within the crypto/blockchain tech. My baby boomer dad loves to criticize Bitcoin because "The first person on the market isn't always the most successful." As if you can't hold them all and benefit from whatever forks happen in the future. And as if some don't do completely different things, like ETH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:00:04
Add to that the fact that every transaction that made up the amount you’re sending will add 1x the transaction fee. Few people seem to realize this, and it’s absolutely crippling for businesses taking bitcoin to pay $20 for every single $5 transaction they made.

Any smart person knows to take anything on the internet with a grain of salt though.

It's also easy to learn how to code web pages and software on your own...but if *everyone* was willing to spend the time to do that, my job wouldn't be as valuable as it is. Nobody can become an expert at everything. There just isn't enough time. And learning shit on the internet isn't necessarily mastery.

So it's kinda like how the bank owns your house when you have a mortgage, but they don't have to guarantee you a house. They trust you to watch over *a* house. Or a house worth of money. So they make you pay for insurance so that the value of the asset can be recovered if anything happens to it. Your house burns down, insurance pays the cost (minus deductible) and rebuilds your house, so you still have a house to pay the bank for. I guess it's kinda like that. You own the money in the bank, and you make the bank pay for insurance through the FDIC to make sure your asset is recovered in case anything happens to the money you're trusting them with.

We're just talking about changing the common unit to 1/1000th, not actually changing the price of one Bitcoin. If we change the standard unit to mBTC, then yeah, 1 mBTC would only equal ~$17, but you'd also have 1000 more mBTC than you had BTC, and no new BTC had to be created. So you'd be happy, because the value of your investment didn't change, and there will still only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. Not really misleading.

I think you underestimate how quickly things will go to shit just from things like ATMs and cash registers being offline. Freezers and refrigerators? Sure maybe all the data from the entire financial system is stored in a faraday cage somewhere. How long does it take to restore order enough for that data to even matter? You have maybe 2-3 days before all the food in everyone's fridge and all the supermarkets goes bad. Are there enough nonperishables at your grocery stores to feed your entire town in a few days notice? Hell just look at places that have to suddenly prepare for hurricanes...they sometimes have a week or more notice to stock up, and stores still run out of water, toilet paper, etc. And that's when people are able to purchase it.
Is every water pump and treatment station inside a faraday cage? How about all the electrical means of supplying food? You do understand how supply chains work, don't you? It would take a very long time to get everything back to normal. Meanwhile food and clean water are scarce, or nobody can get out money to buy them because the banks are down and nobody can prove they have any.
And that's just one possible scenario where the dollar becomes worthless. Beanie Babies could be a better store of value than the dollar if the perfect storm of bad shit goes down. You've seen what happened in Zimbabwe?

More importantly, how can a small business survive accepting bitcoin when they have to pay 15-20 dollars per input transaction to transfer their money to cold storage, or from a wallet into an exchange? There's no feasible way something like a coffee shop or a bar making transactions of $5-$20 could ever use bitcoin anymore, unless they are holding their money on an exchange and just making the customer deal with paying $15 in transaction fees for a coffee or beer. And who is even going to do that?

You can lend just fine. It just requires funds that don’t belong to the people keeping their money in the bank.
I mean, if the bank loans out my money and then I come to withdraw all that money, where’d that loan just come from? It still has to be paid back. So now the bank has created money out of nothing.

The beauty is, Bitcoin isn't a company. It has no employees to pay, no shareholders to satisfy. Even if it somehow went down to Dogecoin prices, it could still rise back up and recover as long as people accepted the *idea*. It's kind of like the internet in that regard. Even a massive failure like the "dotcom" bubble we saw with the rise of the internet won't stop the idea from taking hold and having utility.

Bread only gives you a 12 word seed and I like the extra security of the 24 words that Ledger gives me. Also, I want to be able to separate my "bank" (hardware storage) from my "wallet" (mobile app) for security reasons. It sucks that transaction fees are making this infeasible.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:17:31
Bread wallet doesn't let you set your fee. They give you two options, Regular, or Economy. Neither are working right now. I think you're underestimating the fees right now... I have an unconfirmed transaction trying to deposit into said wallet right now for 60 sat/byte that has been in the mempool for several days. I don't know what this particular wallet app is using to reject the transactions, but they've been coming back after about 12-24 hours.

So the deal with miners is you pay for the electricity but are rewarded with more than enough to pay for it. Seems like a system that could work for UBI. I'm not just talking about Bitcoin either, we could have people confirming all sorts of ledgers on all sorts of different blockchains. This would provide a useful service for a variety of industries. I imagine a future where miners are rented or  leased to own and literally your only job is to make sure it doesn't lose power or internet. For this you are rewarded proportionally to how much of the network you dedicate yourself to maintaining.

I'm not arguing that certain transactions shouldn't be able to pay for priority. I'm just arguing that there is no such thing as "fake volume". Every transaction has a right to exist. A transaction does not gain its legitimacy from the network's capacity or incapacity to handle it.

Not really. If you got in a month ago and sold today, you made 40%. If you got in a year ago and sold today, you made 1500%. If you got in last week and sold today, you lost 25%. It's not hard to understand how this would be relevant on an individual level.

I have no delusions about what money is and what makes something valuable.

For real. I have nearly $2000 in equipment just to mine around 1.1 Zcash a month, about $350-$400 at current rates. 
The top Ethereum mining account on Nanopool has an average hashrate of 1.8 million megahashes distrubuted across 15000 different workers and is making $163,000 in ETH a DAY. Can you imagine how much it must have cost to accumulate over 150000 mining rigs? Imagine the kind of investment it would take into *anything at all* to be making $4.9 million a month!
Here's the acccount I'm talking about, be sure to click the calculator.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:25:43
Secure as far as the network, I mean. More confirmations from different sources. I'm actually not completely sure how it would work if just one miner was running, but I assume it would be responsible for every confirmation.
Plus, if that one miner loses power or internet, there goes the whole network. The more miners you bring on board, the closer to impossible it will be to take down the network via regional utility outages.

Gold sucks at being a currency. It can never be good as a currency because it's not portable and it's difficult to divide. It is not a good thing for Bitcoin to be gold. Satoshi's whitepaper is entitled, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System".

Yep. But there comes a time where inequality becomes so great that the poor just eat the rich.
I imagine a system where the companies own the robots, but the robots are useless without the decentralized brain that is controlled by miners. Might be the only feasible solution to this. If the robots get too powerful, miners pull out and they lose their computing power.

Listen man, I was all in on Bitcoin. The REAL bitcoin. Until like a week ago when I got my Ledger (because again, all in, gotta protect dem gainz) - and now I can't move any of my coin out of my Breadwallet because they don't let me set a high enough fee and I'm already paying hundreds of dollars. 
And for whatever reason, no other wallet is working right now when I try to recover using my private keys. I've tried Mycelium and Greenaddress and both give an error message. Should be noted that I have used these same seed words to restore my wallet to my phone in the past. 
So to recap, I can't even follow the advice that has been spread as gospel by the community - to store your savings offline in a hardware wallet. Not your keys, not your bitcoin, etc etc. Can't even affordably follow procedures to safeguard my bitcoin anymore. How secure do you think this makes me in Bitcoin? I've had no problem at all moving my Litecoin, BCash, or ZCash to my ledger. All quick, easy, and affordable. With Bitcoin, my money is literally stuck right now unless I can find a way to recover my wallet to an app that will let me pay 20% of my money in transaction fees to actually move it.

Well if I *was* brilliant, I'd probably have no problem getting a scholarship to pay for me to go to school. And I'd probably major in something I was already good at, so I wouldn't actually have to actually learn anything. Why rely on potential employers knowing me and my experience on a personal level, when I could slack off for 4 years to get a piece of paper that proves my skills, all for free? Hell, I could even start up a side business to further enhance my resume while I was going through all the easy stuff at school.
Oh that's right, I did do all that.
But hey, to each his own. If you're planning on starting up the next Apple/Microsoft/Tesla instead of getting an education, more power to you, and I wish you all the best. But let's face it, not everyone can be that guy. It takes so much more than just book smarts or technical proficiency.

Again...a bit is another name for a microbitcoin, it's not it's own BASE unit. Bitcoin is the BASE unit, from which all derivatives derive their prefix. Same with "meter" or "gram" or "liter".
It's like how some people call millimeters "cunthairs" but nobody ever calls a meter a kilo-cunthair.

What benefit do you get out of paying interest simply because it's lower right now? Better credit score? I'm going to go ahead and say good credit isn't much of a concern if you're buying houses for cash.
Unless you can find a very low risk account with a higher interest rate to put all that money in while paying off the mortgage, like adding it into your 401(k), but then how do you use it to pay off your mortgage?

At which point using the dollar as a basis of comparison for store of value would be useless. It'd be like saying the dollar is worth 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. For Bitcoin to reach that high of a price it would have more value than all the currency in the entire world, but all of the currency in the world will have been simultaneously devalued to get it there. I think "the moon" needs to be the point where comparing bitcoin to fiat currency loses and useful meaning. Which probably is around the point that the market caps of Bitcoin and fiat are equal.

No, but I would if I could. Do you think people buy Teslas knowing absolutely nothing about them? You can go watch a video or something on how autopilot works. This is the internet, not 17th century catholicism.
They will stop for you but then autopilot stops and alerts you to regain control. They have the option to turn on the creep forward like you'd get from an automatic car, or have it stay put or roll back like a manual transmission car would. So one way or the other, you have to hold your foot on the brake when you're stopped. You have to use the brake at some point, because it's not a completely autonomous vehicle. It is a car with intelligent cruise control that can stay in its lane, change lanes, and slow down or stop when the car in front of it does. That's all.

Bitcoin is not considered money as far as tax purposes. That's why it's subject to capital gains tax. You don't profit from it until you sell it. If it were an asset like a house you could rent it out and get a monthly income from owning it, but for bitcoin you have to sell it to make money, until it gets fully adopted as a currency. Its ideal use is as its own money/currency, but most of its use right now is the fact that it's gaining a lot of worth in fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:41:26
Point is that Bitcoin only recently became something with a welcome mat at the door. For a while it was fairly technical, and required knowledge on how to build a computer from scratch. It was something most of the general public didn't have the skills to do, and couldn't be bothered to learn.
As a male who would have gotten into this much earlier if it was a little easier, it's not like Bitcoin has ever been welcoming. It has always been a pain in the ass to buy or create bitcoins. It's just less so now.

The same reason a milimeter is not a kilomicrometer. Jesus fuck the education system is seriously failing us. You can't just call shit whatever you want.

People get crazy with speculations like this, not realizing there's only a set amount of value in the world, and currency becomes meaningless if it doesn't represent some sort of actual value... for 1 satoshi to equal a quarter or whatever a pack of gum is, the market cap of Bitcoin would have to be higher than the value of the entire world's GDP by many trillions. Remember, one satoshi is 1/100,000,000th (one one-hundred-millionth) of a bitcoin.

You only have to pay taxes on Bitcoin when you sell it - it's considered an asset.

Everyone says that and nobody can verify how long anyone has been in Bitcoin, because that's just how it is.
If you've been in BTC for so long, you'd know you're not even saying anything new. There's always a correction coming. Thing is, nobody who is in it for the long term is afraid of corrections because if you believe in the utility of the technology and hold Bitcoin because you believe it could truly revolutionize currency and banking, then you realize it may still be dramatically undervalued regardless of day to day volatility.
And if a jokingly ridiculous prediction is enough to make you sell off your BTC? Yeah, you definitely are bullshitting about having been in this for "a long time". We smell your type a mile off.

The point of the system is to keep us forever enslaved in debt. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you'll realize the futility of "paying off the national debt". We'll sooner go bankrupt than pay off 20 trillion dollars that we just decided existed in the first place. There's no gold or silver backing it, just numbers in computers that nobody can truly verify. The game is rigged against you, bub. The banks are the only ones that win. Bitcoin removes them from the equation and makes it so that you have to actually be responsible with your own money.

In the grand scheme of things, it is. Generally money itself is not the problem (especially if you *have* a bunch of it), but people's failure to manage it properly. In my opinion, hiding your finances from each other is not a great way to properly manage them. *That's* what leads to the fighting, most of the time. Hell I personally know a guy who recently got divorced because he found out his wife had maxed out several credit cards and was drowning in debt without ever telling him. Having money doesn't cause problems in a relationship. You're thinking of *not* having money.
Or, you know, letting your spouse think you don't have any money and you guys are struggling, stressing out your family and stuff when secretly you have millions stashed away in internet money. Can't see how that's not going to cause an issue.

There's no practical reason we'd need to further subdivide satoshis. Even if you were to take all ~$25 trillion of currency that exists in the world economy and converted it to bitcoin, a satoshi would equal just a little over one cent in US dollar. Even assuming there are only 12 million coins in circulation, we go up to 2¢ per satoshi. There is talk today of getting rid of pennies and rounding to the nickel anyway, so practically speaking it would work out fine.

Don't buy PayPal MyCash unless you're able to spend with a PayPal debit card - they will freeze or disable your account if you add MyCash money and then try to withdraw it to cash or a bank account.

I like Hashnest's cloud mining. It's not limited to 2 years and you can sell back your hashpower. Probably not as good as owning your own Antminer, but not a terrible thing for a beginner to check out.
Genesis is just garbage though. They charge crazy amounts for hashpower that gets revoked after 2 years.

Just put in $5-10 a week. You're not technically spending it so it's always there if you need it, but it will continue to grow bit by bit.

There will be fewer in circulation due to lost wallets and all, but there definitely won't be more unless they change the foundation of bitcoin.
I guess it's entirely possible that we'll make a few more trillion and devalue fiat currency even more in the next 150 years or so.

Don't these kind of cards make every daily expense into capital gains that can be taxed?

Soon we can move on to "Stop hitting yourself!", when we are actually the ones making them hit themselves.

I know it's not necessarily serious, but for sake of calculations...
For a bitcoin to be 5 million dollars there'd have to be $105 trillion of currency in existence. Estimates at gross worldwide product are only like $75-80 trillion...so not only would bitcoin have to replace all the currency in the world, it would have to somehow become more valuable than the entire world's productivity.

I think if you got in on this any time after the first jump to 1,000, you don't deserve to make that much off it. The early adopters took a big risk on equipment and time for something that could have been worth absolutely nothing. Those of us buying on Coinbase and stuff now with this fully established market should be happy to see even a doubling of our cash. There aren't many investments that will see over a 100% ROI in a year, let alone a thousand-fold increase. Profiting the most from this also took arguably the most risk.

Yeah, I guess my point is that once Bitcoin overtakes any other world currency in market cap, the value of all those other currencies begins to mean nothing, much like the value of the Zimbabwe dollar.

Why do people keep saying this number? It's like you don't understand how bitcoin or currency works at all. **IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.**
Do the math. Only 21 million bitcoin, ever. 5 million a piece. That's 105 trillion. There's not even that much money in the entire world. GWP is about 78 trillion. So I mean, I guess it's *possible*, but only at the point that all other world currencies are worthless anyway.

Can you still use GDAX in the UK? If so, put fiat in Coinbase, transfer fiat to GDAX and place a limit order to buy bitcoin.

Wouldn't better money have *some* incentive to move it through the economy? It seems like there's almost no incentive to spend your bitcoin right now because every satoshi you spend could have bought you even more stuff in the future. If everyone is afraid to buy anything for fear of missing out on value, then what?

Interest is a killer. Depending on the debt he could have saved hundreds a month just by getting rid of the debt.

So this currency we speak of - how does it take over fiat if nobody ever wants to spend it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:11:53
So I'll go ahead and tell you right now, it's not going to happen because it's not possible. All world currency would have to be replaced and then we'd still have to pull 20 trillion or so in value out of nothing.
