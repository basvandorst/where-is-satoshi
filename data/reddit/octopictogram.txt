Yeah I think the people who think it's going to become a currency is complete ly overshadowed by the number wanting a get rich quick method

I recently got into it at 11k, I dropped a 100 on it and am having fun watching it go up and down. I've known about btx for years but never got in, regrettably. It's a bit scary to watch it rose fast when it's probably about to drop eventually because big players selling off. It's way more fun investing here than into the stock market or such

Yes because amazon is a small thing. And BTC is huge.
Just because they haven't started accepting it yet, doesn't mean they won't start eventually.

Who cares what Rap Genius thinks? I doubt ANY of you even knew what the site was previous to this. Why does it matter now?

But they are the most well known. When you think of a BTC Exchange, most will think Gox.

It's just the logo. The animal had nothing to do with it. It's honestly a really good site. 
I prefer it over hub

I was joking for the most part.
