There is often a difference in price between exchanges because of their different fees. Many exchanges don't offer a good deposit system and it affects market liquidity. Just because one exchange has a price $40 higher than yours doesn't mean you'll come away with more money when all the transfers are complete and fees have been taken. Many bots scan the market for these arbitrage opportunities and will close the price gaps in fractions of a second.

Oh lol I've been using GDAX. Be careful if you plan on using margin trading. There's a lot of risk involved and you shouldn't do it unless you have sufficient experience. And if you want my personal advice, you're a little late to the party for a short. Anything after today will be pretty risky considering the market will likely restabilize. I don't see this as a trend reversal.

I shorted it today and it was the best decision ever

You would have to transfer your bitcoins from breadwallet to GDAX. In order for you to trade on an exchange, you need to have your currency stored on that exchange. It really seems like you're new to this. I would recommend that you trade a little bit using only your own money on the exchange before you experiment with margin trading. That way you can familiarize yourself with the interface and the trading mindset. Anyways, to send your Bitcoin to GDAX, you need to create a coinbase account. GDAX is the exchange for Coinbase, so you don't need to set anything else up. Log into GDAX and under the deposit tab, you'll find your BTC Address. Send your Bitcoin on your breadwallet account to that address and you can begin trading. It's pretty much the same process for every other exchange
