Paper notes (IOUs)  of bitcoin are decoupled from bitcoin. Their value may trend with bitcoin but is actually an entire different beast. If consumers lose confidence in the bitcoin IOUs, the price of the IOUs will fall, real bitcoin is not affected . Check out decoupling on investopedia

The thing is, a "bitcoin fund" is decoupled from bitcoin. A Bitcoin fund listed on the NYSE does not issue IOUs to represent bitcoin, rather it issues shares of the fund. If a bitcoin fund wants to lie to investors about the number of bitcoin held the price of the fund will suffer when the lie comes to the surface. People who hold shares of that fund are entitled to no bitcoin

This "investor" must not be very qualified, this is dead simple math and in this business model the revenue generating activity is always the transaction volume.
If I own a gold vending machine and the price of gold skyrockets I still need transactions to generate revenue. If no one uses my machine I have no revenue. Now price certainly could be a factor in transaction volume but your scenarios do not take changing volume based on price into consideration

ELI21: Sell futures to lock in btc price.  Miners who are uncertain about the price of btc may choose to lock in their selling price by selling futures now. If they lock in (sell futures) at 500 and the price goes to 530 they have to buy back (pay the difference, 30) to cover the loss (price went up, but they were short). Does this help?

"cheap solar" has nothing to do with this. It doesn't matter if the energy I consume is "cheap solar" or "cheap coal" or "cheap gas" the part that matters is the price.


If burning physical fiat in larges drums and converting the heat to steam to drive turbine generators ever becomes the cheapest source of energy, then wherever the energy is the cheapest will still be the most profitable. It doesn't matter how the energy is produced

Miners may feel very uncertain about the halvening, if they are of the opinion that the btc price will go down after the halvening they would choose to lock in their selling price now by going short (selling short on spot, or selling futures). If the btc price goes down, they will make money on the short sell. The gains will offset the losses. If a producer (miner) hedges 100% of their production, (their futures position matches their actual position) they have effectively locked in a selling price

The halving is already factored into the price of bitcoin. The market is very efficient with information. All information is factored into the price, that is how markets work. The halving is not dooms day

IMO, proving ownership by signing a message with a private key is a user story that does not provide much value in the ecospace and will not be done commonly in the future.

Not a general rule. Prices are determined via supply and demand, the cost of R&amp;D is really unrelated to the price you pay when buying a ASIC from a manufacturer. This is true for all things that you buy, it doesn't matter how much it cost to build/develop/package/ship/market. The price is set by the market
