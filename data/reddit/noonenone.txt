Don't let the trolls discourage you. I'm very upset about the demise of Silk Road for various reasons but the most obvious that no one seems to have thought of is simply this: Isn't it infinitely better if your addicted siblings or neighbors or your kids or relatives or self be able to order drugs online and get a package in the mail instead of having to buy from potentially dangerous criminals on the streets?
If an addict is able to buy the drugs needed online, they can remain in a social context in which they can keep their jobs and families, *not* sink into the kinds of crime that hurt others asides from themselves, find help, have a chance to get treatment, etc. If addicts are forced to buy from scary mafioso or cartel type people in dark alleyways and become criminalized and ostracized from normal society, we *all* lose. Addicts don't want to be criminals. Old ladies who find that life is infinitely nicer when they have buds don't want to be criminals. All these people who don't want to hurt anyone are practically forced to become criminals. Why do we want that to happen? No one wins if we do this. DPR seems to be an idealist and a good person. I don't know about hiring hit men. I don't trust the media to report the truth about everything anymore.
For this and many other reasons, it sucks that Silk Road is gone and I don't mind saying so. Downvote all you want; it's an honor to be downvoted by ignoramuouses.
(OP I wish you the very best. Someone has to do this and it might as well be you. If I had money, I'd donate but I'm a bum who can't even write code. Please make updates about your project if you're serious -- but in another subreddit. Maybe you can just create a new sub.?)

I get a message from Chrome saying this is a link to a suspicious site. Why?

We must not allow fear to govern us!
