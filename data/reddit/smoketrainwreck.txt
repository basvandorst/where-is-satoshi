You've just won at Bitcoin. As a dog lover, good on you for adopting a great dog and giving her a happy life!

Well, we're talking $4.6 million USD at the current rate of $111 per 1 BTC as of 8:30PM GMT. It's more of a question of what percentage will be moved but remain as BTC and what percentage will be cashed out.

In most circumstances, it's uncommon for someone to be frozen out of their assets. Some people affected may view the overall bitcoin ecosystem as more volatile than they're comfortable with (whether warranted or unwarranted). Currencies succeed based off of trust -- trust in access and trust in usability (someone willing to accept it in a transaction).
Such a large quantity (0.3%) of the overall count of bitcoins in existence were frozen out of active use for a period over 24 hours -- due to a security breach of 3rd party system. For some, that might be enough to avoid bitcoin usage for a while.
Let's not devolve into an exchange about what Instawallet/Bitcoin-Central should have done or chastise those that used the services either. Ultimately, this comes down to trust in a usable currency. Being frozen out of one's funds does not foster trust among those affected.

At this point, Instawallet really should make a statement. This is Day 3, and the only information Instawallet has publicly provided is the "Down for Maintenance" message on the homepage. With the price of BTC at a record high, whatever they do they must do it very carefully.

You're going to see some reversal the minute the [Instawallet/Bitcoin-Central security breach]( is resolved. Remember: 41,854.5915 BTC are essential frozen out of usage until that's addressed. I'd expect a good deal of that to get withdrawn and cashed out given the rate of return.
