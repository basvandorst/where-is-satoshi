So you agree with that system. You deposit $1 in a bank and that bank (via derivatives and other schemes) lends your $1 out 10, 20, 30 times? In the process paying you 0% interest. When depositors want their money and the bank doesn't have it a "central bank" debases the currency making people poorer and in the process enriches the banks further....  and you think that's a good system?

So by your own admission the dollar is NOT a store of value, which is the exact argument posed against bitcoin. 
Inflation is good when there is DEMAND-PULL inflation i.e, when many people want a good/service the price moves up. With inflation caused by currency debasement only those who own assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, etc) benefit. However, this is a gross missallocation of resources (which creates inefficiencies and productivity lag) as money is moved for the sole purpose that IT HAS TO MOVE...somewhere, anywhere. The vast majority are punished, especially savers, and the rich get richer as they are the only ones who experience the "wealth effect" caused by increasing asset values.

I've been procrastinating for months on a purchase that I finally decided to pull the trigger on. I did this because i. I needed it, and ii. a major online retailer began accepting bitcoin. 
What I loved was how EASY it was:
(at checkout) 
i. QR code was there. 
ii. opened coinbase on my phone and went to "send bitcoin" 
iii. pointed my phone at my computer. 
iv. magic happened. it was done.
I didn't have to type 1 keystroke to make a payment.

HAHA! I was talking about this to friends almost a year ago. I had a friend who was going through a divorce and his wife was gona wipe it out. I was like DUDE put ALL YOUR MONEY IN BITCOIN. IF the court is savvy enough to track you through the blockchain and compel you to give up your bitcoin just say "I forgot my private key when I hit my head during an untimely canoe accident" 
Protecting your assets with bitcoin during a divorce is HUGE.

"so if I walk to the store to buy some smokes, will the guy tell me he can't accept dollars because by sqig's own admission "dollars are not a store of value" so that settles that, dollars are now worthless."
Of course you can use dollars!!!! What I'm saying is that if you are responsible and SAVE your dollars they will be worth less in the future. If you earned $1 a hundred years ago and saved it that dollar is now worth....2 pennies. So where is the store of value? 
If you bought 1 bitcoin 4 years ago it would have been worth 50 cents and you could have probably bummed a smoke from a stranger...how many packs of smokes could you buy today for that same bitcoin had you held it? 870 per btc/$6 = 145 packs of cigs or 2,900 cigs.

Good looks.

Good looks bro. I read that techcrunch piece and was prepping to hunker down and buy more on a crash or something. This is why I brought my concern to reddit and my concern has been assuaged.

Wow. Epic find. So this whole thing is probably BS. Thx.

I have not watched this but several of my friends I've told about bitcoin stumbled on it and found it very helpful. I figured the course may be applicable to your situation in some way. Not sure but here it is:

Yea, I laughed at that too. The FED printing $1 Trillion a year and the USG has lost faith in bitcoin? 
I wanted to reach out to the reddit community because the article said the coins were "on the move" but this is the address 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX and no coins have moved. Not sure what to make of this.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:30:28
I thought about that. Seeing as the IRS hasn't defined bitcoin or how it's taxed I'm not sure if asset seizure laws apply to bitcoin. I'm not a lawyer but I don't see any legal purpose that would prevent the government from selling the coins in order to get what is defined as legal tender. Plus it said he entered into a plea (admission of guilt)...but again I'm not a lawyer.
....an exchange IS an auction. It's no secret the government (and more importantly banks) are not fans of bitcoin. Destabilizing the price could be like killing two birds with one stone. 
I'm just speculating based on that article from techcrunch.

Why no Android version? Apple has banned all kind of apps related to bitcoin. This is an app I would love to have on my android.
I got rid of my iphone specifically because they have been so hostile towards bitcoin.

It's not really Moore's Law. It's Tower Of Babel syndrome and it concerns me long-term with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:17:18
I know that. But most people don't want or need to buy a 1TB harddrive just to support the bitcoin network. I have literally gotten 100 people to buy bitcoin and maybe 40 actually know how it works. 
I would just imagine that as the blockchain grows and the acceptance/adoption goes parabolic that you will need more nodes not less. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:32:23
You should write a sub reddit about it.

It would be like adding a band-aid to a melanoma and saying it's treated because you can't see it. 
The problem is there, and while you can't see it it will get worse over time and undermine bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:51:57
You're spending an awful lot of time in a forum that you seem to be implying isn't a good place to follow bitcoin. In fact after looking at your account, you post A LOT about bitcoin on reddit. Troll on brotha.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:05:15
Yes you need full nodes and people are prescribing to the fact that "you can have smaller pieces" That's like taking an accounting ledger, throwing it through a shredder, and having someone put it back together again to verify a transaction...isn't that efficient.
I hope people buy hard drives soley to hold the blockchain. I don't think most people will. Which will give rise to an altcoin. 
This shit needs to get figured out. It's not imminent but it's a case where bitcoin's strength is it's biggest weakness.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:31:14
Thanks for the reply however, I don't feel like my fears have been assuaged: 
i. The bitcoin network is so reliable because the entire blockchain exists in so many places (the internet would have to go off globally and simultaneously to fuck it up) However if you have a shit ton of fractional nodes than that doesn't really do anything and will end up fucking up transaction time as miners are hopping around from micro blockchain to micro blockchain trying to figure shit out. 
---&gt;Government can and HAVE shut off the internet, checkout Egypt during the revolution: 
ii. Refer to i. And not many people can run a full 70GB standalone file without materially the speed of the cpu
iii. That makes certain assumptions and I'm not referring to transactions that don't live on the block chain. Just a few months ago the block chain was 4GB. If the growth goes exponential so will the size of the block chain. 
iv. Miners have it in their best interest just like Central Banks have it in their best interest. Kind of takes away the whole "decentralized" thing if only a few people can support the blockchain. Also, if only a few people can support the block chain it makes it an easy thing to shut down, just shutdown the big miners and you've just killed bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:55:59
I get Moore's law. 
The average size of a hard drive is 500gb. In just over 2 years the blockchain has gone from 3GB to 11GB or roughly 2-3% of a typical hard drive. Let's say it just doubles in the next year, that would put it at 5% of a typical hard drive. Bitcoin is growing faster than typical computer speeds (exponentially) 
Now I'm not talking about this being an IMMINENT threat but Moore's law also applies to bitcoin. At some point we are going to get less and less nodes. But than we'll get micro nodes. That will materially slow down the bitcoin network and create an easier means of forking the chain. For people who bring up Moore's law you should also take into account The Law Of Diminishing Returns. Than why not at that point choose an altcoin over bitcoin?
I bring this up for good reason, not to troll. This is something I am really concerned about
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:57:39
You're talking about the .000001% of minds in the world. Those people you're referencing were coming up with new theories and literally changing the way in which we perceive the natural universe. You're comparing apples to oranges. I was talking about the teachers/professors who sit in lecture after lecture regurgitating the same vomit whether or not it's even true. The type of teachers who for centuries taught students that the world is flat. That is 99.9% of academia today, just a bunch of nobodies looking for their bullshit tenure and pension.
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:33:09


BUT the bitcoin network NEEDS a lot of nodes (people who have the WHOLE blockchain) It is what makes it "decentralized". 
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:40:38
If he's pontificating on bitcoin he; i. reads as this is the best place for news and information on bitcoin; ii. has a student who does. 
I am fully prepared to follow through.
Though seeing as you are a bit offended I'll donate any bitcoin from this post to a charity that accepts bitcoin. You can prove the veracity of my statement by simply referring to the blockchain. 
Is there anything you'd like to add about the actual content of my post or were you just feeling persnickety?
