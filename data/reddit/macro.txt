Why do you hate the free market?

Jesus christ. Just stop man. 
For those who are downvoting me read the thread first. I already explained this to him. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:25:41
This has nothing to do with being a noob and everything with having some common sense. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:49:00
In 10 years people like you will still be here claiming how great all these cheap 5 dollar coins are. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:13:01
No. 
Downvoted for answering his question. Well done @_date: 2016-02-09 15:20:55
Read. 
I said only 16 year olds care about buzz words like "the halvening". No serious investor would put serious money into bitcoin because of that. 
It's a Reddit thing. Only "hodlers" care about this non-event. But you don't realize this as all your bitcoin news comes from this echo chamber. The real world is different. Very different. 
But don't take my word for it. 
Please go to a business centre in the nearest big city and ask some traders and investors what they think about bitcoin, "the halvening" and if "this is gentlemen". Maybe also ask them if you should "hodl". 
Please, post the results here. Really, i'd love to read it. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:20:12
They jumped on the hype train and got tons of free advertising for accepting bitcoin. Now that hype is over nobody there gives a crap about it anymore. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:34:01
You have no way of knowing if it's a good time to buy. Really no way. And you shouldn't be telling people this. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:24:20
Well excuse me very much. 3 times. I made a horrible mistake there. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:21:41
It has been ANYTHING but stable. No idea how you can possibly claim this. And there is no way of knowing if the halvening (cringe) will do anything to the price. No serious investor would buy based on that. Only 16 year olds in this sub. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 11:08:39
Bitcoin user not affected. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:30:07
No they're not. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:17:57
Why you should care? Maybe to get out of this echo chamber for once and see how the real world thinks about bitcoin. 
But obviously you are not interested in that. Which i wouldn't either if i was sitting on a bag of coins and fully expect to get rich off it. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:04:44
He refuses to accept this and instead will get angry when you explain this to him. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:28:05
No you didn't. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:59:13
Sure. And until then investors won't put money in bitcoin for obvious reasons. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:42:06
Just keep downloading. In a week or so you might be able to use your coins. 
Keep in mind though the network is overloaded most of the time so a transaction might take a few hours. 
Also use plenty of fees or it will never confirm. 
And don't use a computer that is connected to the internet. Too risky. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:22:44
Do you seriously expect anyone here or on this planet really to answer this? How can you possibly think anyone can look into the future?
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:09:44
Bitcoin bitcoin bitcoin!!!1
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:26:32
People rather deal with that than all the issues bitcoin has. 
But as you won't believe me why don't you test it yourself. 
Ask 10 random people on the street if they rather use bitcoin or paypal. Please come back here to post the results. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:03:11
There is no evidence whatsoever that investors will move to bitcoin. It's nothing more than wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:05:16
No. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 10:10:14
"This time it's really happening guys! Just look at all these irrelevant reasons!"
Where have i seen that before?
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:48:12
And you have no idea why people actually think all that about bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:44:48
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:11:34
"Stocks are going down. Let's invest in a currency that can drop 100 bucks overnight"
Yeah sounds great. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:29:58
All your replies could be replaced by "if i win the jackpot". 
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:42:45
I love how we get the same predictions year after year. In 5 years from now you'll be posting how PP will start using bitcoin in 2021. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:29:43
The price was 4 times higher than it is now. Most people in this sub are in the red. 
And even if it increased 7 years straight it could drop in year 8. 
Again, common sense. You don't need to be an markets genius to realize this. 
Why am i being downvoted?
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:00:26
Blackmailing. Bitcoin's killer app!
@_date: 2016-02-09 22:04:39
After 7 years of existence a bitcoin sign is today's top news? Uh wow. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:55:38
Yes. You will be rich if you buy 100 bucks now. There is your answer. You can move on now. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:00:17
There are no millions of bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:34:03
In your little fantasy world it's all about bitcoin. In their reality business world it's taking care of people stealing their shit. And still not giving a shit about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 11:03:33
And what about the other information bitcoiners put there?
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:51:47
The price of freedom. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:47:13
99.99999999% of the world doesn't use bitcoin. Whatever reason you can think of why openbazaar is better, this makes it pretty much useless. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 00:43:05
And who here exactly is expected to answer that according to you?
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:57:36
And this has what to do with bitcoin again?
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:30:01
Or maybe, just maybe they really don't give a shit about the few bitcoiners out there and didn't even think for 1 second about trolling them. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:41:36
No, there aren't millions of gamers now reading about bitcoin. There really aren't. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:01:53
Why do you hate the free market? Why do you hate freedom?
@_date: 2016-02-14 23:58:46
I see we're getting euphoric again. This time it's not just a pump and dump, right? This time it's all fundamentals, right?
@_date: 2016-02-08 14:12:00
You're joking right?
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:07:04
No answer, just downvotes. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 07:23:40
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:22:12
And why will the coming month be crazy exactly? Fundamentals? Reasons?
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:06:20
Why? What will happen at the "halvening"?
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:00:43
Yes, and?
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:00:18
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:33:20
Check the thread we're in. It's about Paypal. 
Sending a wire to whatever company to buy bitcoin also takes 3 days. 
Paypal is instant. And it won't let me wait 1 hour for confirmations. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:19:54
2017 dude. 2017 is the year it will happen. 
Or maybe 2018. 
But who knows maybe 2019. 
Bitcoin is still in Beta. It's only 7 years old. 
Maybe when it's 20 year old. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:24:24
My comment is still valid. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:41:04
Believe it or not, nobody can predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years. 
Do you even know what common sense means? This is getting really stupid. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:48:12
How are they not affected??
@_date: 2016-02-13 17:28:32
There is no inside scoop. Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:52:20
I answered your question in the first post: nobody knows. And several times after. And i'll do it again as a reply to your last post. Nobody knows. 
Yet you clearly won't accept this answer and keep going on till someone tells you yes you will get rich by investing 100 bucks now. So please stop asking and buy your 100 bucks worth.
