valid - I changed it to "one of the most popular exchanges." 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:48:54
Yes would love to. Let me know once approved. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:50:00
Please do! Thanks

Thanks! Much appreciated!

Gotcha, so basically the puzzle gets solves and the block gets added, at which point the 51% confirmation kicks in - once all the transactions on the individual block are confirmed, the process starts over.

glad someone can appreciate an Amerigo Vespucci pun!

Appreciate the feedback and certainly understand what you're saying - people have short attention spans. I do think there are plenty of resources out there that explain it simply in a couple sentences. 
I think I should have worded it "people who don't understand it who are interested in an in depth understanding." The idea stems from the fact that that's where I was about 7 months ago. I went and read a ton about it and tried to boil this down to the concrete things I came across that really helped me understand it to save people time.

I think Gnutella is the example I was looking for - thanks!

I thought I remembered reading that Tor was a peer-to-peer network for sharing files, including music. Definitely could be mistaken, I will verify from the source I got that example from. 
I'm in Singapore so it's quite late - will check tomorrow morning. Thanks for the tip!

Basically what Simon was saying was that people will continue to spend fiat currencies while storing their wealth outside of their governments currency. Effectively, it will be the worlds HODL. 
I don't think what you're saying is contradictory. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:29:14
I got it mixed up with Gnutella - thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:56:13
exactly what I was looking for - the mechanics of mining was the hardest part. It's late where I am so I'm headed to bed but I'll revise in the AM. Much appreciated!

Yeah a $300B crypto marketcap really is a drop in the bucket relative to what's out there 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:29:43
Valid point but that’s not to say that the points he’s making aren’t valid as well
@_date: 2019-03-01 00:47:19
Yeah but would be hard to order pizza without giving an address :)
But get your point. Moreso I just think it’s cool that it’s functional and there are apps with intuitive UIs that don’t really take too much effort to figure out and get started. 
Big step in the right direction I think 
@_date: 2019-03-01 00:50:19
Also excited to see what other interesting things people spin out. I think one thing that’s really cool is how quickly these things come online. I think/hope use cases people come up with are only going to continue to get more ingenuitive

This guy also echos similar sentiments: 
@_date: 2019-02-28 23:12:07
Interesting, we didn't have any issues with the delivery but signing 4 receipts does sound odd. I do have no idea how it works in the backend. 
6/7 would pizza again

when arguing my with my cousin, whose of the opinion that bitcoin is a fraud/bubble/mirage, one of his points was that it's not a currency because he can't use it to buy a loaf of bread. 
Now he can... he just has to go to South Africa to do so

Overtstock has an interesting policy- they convert 50% of all Bitcoin purchases to fiat and retain the rest in BTC to keep exposure to the upside (CEO Patrick Bryne has always been a huge believer in crypto)

The goal of the blog is for someone with little to no understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrencies to read it and walk away with a better understanding of what it is, how it works and its importance to society. 
I am not a blockchain or bitcoin expert but rather, am an enthusiast. I've spent a lot of time trying to understand the big picture importance of bitcoin and blockchain and feel like I know enough to help others understand it as well. 
What I would like is for those of you who understand it at a more technical, granular level to give this post a read and let me know if there is anything in it that you find to be misleading or inaccurate. 
Thanks!

Much appreciated! 
The second post I've been working on (and struggling with) goes into more detail on how exactly the decentralized network works (mining, proof of work) but I agree, I should definitely work in more emphasis on the importance of decentralization in the opening post. 
Thanks!

Didn't really offer an substance as to why he thinks it's a fraud aside from the same "tulip mania" references we've heard 100 times before. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:29:46
Yeah he's great at breaking down complex topics in a digestible manner. 
Just about done with Blockchain Revolution (Tapscott) and have read The Age of Cryptocurrencies (Vigna / Casey); was thinking of going for The Internet of Money by Antonopoulos next but have heard good things about Mastering Bitcoin as well
