Sorry for not being clear: I'm referring to the Bitcoin protocol... Not its exchanges or the services that spawn from it. My bitcoins are 99.9% secure given no one gets access to my private key (which isnt stored on the cloud anyways)

Noob question: how do you move it to your control? Mind explaining the process (is it paper wallet)? Thanks in advance!

Agreed! I tried to ask "Why Bitcoin?" the other day: 
After over 40 comments I concluded: It fights the "powers-that-be". Also an interesting comment was "Money is just the first app of the block chain, like email was for the internet."... So in conclusion, let Bitcoin mature, and see what happens / how we adapt to adopt it.

Exactly! If anything, this hurts Bitcoin's credibility in the eyes of those that aren't aware of its protocol

It's really looking like this is the "answer". Reading this thread, bitcoin's a great "fight the powers that be". Unfortunately, the same people (at least a majority of them) that can't get their hands on a credit card may also have trouble getting to bitcoins (whether technological limitations or something else)

Thanks for the insight!!
Edit: In my opinion, reading this forum, this is the best way to keep your bitcoins secure (web wallet is like cash in your wallet [can be stolen/lost quick e.g., coinbase shuts down], mobile wallet is like a debit card [can be stolen but need a PIN to use it], and then cold storage [like money in safe/vault])
