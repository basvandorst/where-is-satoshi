Is it though? Are miners holding enough BTC to stagnate a flash sell of? If they aren't then the amount of money they used to mine the BTC doesn't really matter does it? The market is going to do what the market does anyways.

How so? The only thing I need to do is remember the price I bought the bitcoins at and then when I want to make a purchase I check the Bitcoin price, if it is higher then what I bought at I use my Tenx card and if it is lower I use my fiat card.

No, I am in Norway where cryptocurrency gains are taxed as capital gains.

I don't know if I can do this I have the coins on a nano ledger s. Do you know of any resource that explains the process?

Yes, I get that people would list it lower fast but the point I am making is that when you see 30/40/50 billion dollars being added to the BTC market cap there isn't 30/40/50 billion dollars worth of fiat being pushed into BTC, it might just xxx millions.

When I get my salary I split it into four parts  
  
- Bills  
- Essentials(food,fuel...)  
- Investments  
- Entertainment  
If I don't use the Tenx card the only funds going into crypto is from the investments. If I do use the card I can put my entertainment funds into bitcoin as well which increases my exposure to bitcoin.

Coinbase is a company and localbitcoins is a website for individuals to sell and buy btc. The fees on localbitcoins varies a lot and might be higher then on coinbase

ok, thanks :)

That would mean that one of them would have to trust the other to hold on to the coins. They would need to transfer them at some point.

Can you fork the bcash chain though? There is no git repository for it

That is one thing thought was weird too, can't seem to find any development on any of GitHubs related to bitcoin cash.

I have been using bitcoin for most of my daily purchases for the past 4 weeks and I have made a decent profit on it percentage wise.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:34:43
Not if the choice to use btc increases my exposure to btc. If I didn't have the card, this is money id rather have in fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:06:24
I buy btc without fees not even a tx fee to the card. Purchases I make with btc are purchases I would have made anyways just with a fiat card so the choice is between using the btc I buy with a nice profit or not buying the btc at all.

Right! So when the shit hits the fan the price is going to drop like lighting :S

The problem some have with bitcoin cash is that it will increase centralization because of bigger blocks. I must say I don't really fancy the idea of a more centralized bitcoin and in addition to that I don't like that you can't view the source code of bitcoin cash.

I will be paying 28% in taxes when I exchange my crypto into fiat gladly it isn't the 50% that it was before 2013/14.

You can make bank transfers to coinbase.com then login on gdax.com with the same credentials as on coinbase then you can buy with limit orders so that you dont get any fees.
