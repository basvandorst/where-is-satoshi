I understand how fees work, whoever pays the higher fee is obviously more likely to have their transaction but through by a pool. I was just wondering if the best way to go about it is to wait it out.

Not sure which wallet you have, but I have the Trezor. Once the company offers a functioning wallet (for BTG or BCH I'm assuming you're asking about) both are supported on Trezor if you were holding bitcoin on them before the fork you should have them. BTG is in the Beta wallet. If you have a different wallet I'd assume the process is similar.

So the banks won't report for suspicious activity?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:06:38
I'm sorry I'm not familiar with that terminology. What do you mean CTR requirement? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:14:03
So when you say it's not subject to CTR.. does that mean they report it if it's less than 10k? Or do they not report it at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:25:02
Thank you!

Actually... people do watch the keys of the first few transactions ever, which are thought to be his. But they have never moved. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:54:41
I read through this. And you are completely right. No one knows, no one will ever know until whatever happens happens. But I am holding onto both right now and continue to do so... I got BCH for free... so what's to lose?

lol I started at 17, (a few months ago). My parents thought it was a "pyramid scheme" or a "ponzi" and once they saw how much I made they asked me if it was too late to get in.

As I said, GDAX has just trading fees. I transferred my USD to there (which is connected directly to Coinbase) and bought a full bitcoin for only around $10 in fees as opposed to buying a full bitcoin now on Coinbase which will run you well over $100. That being said I bought that at around 2200$. So you'll just have to see the fees on GDAX for buying a full one now. I can assure you it's cheaper than buying straight off of Coinbase.

Look up coinmarketcap.com
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:44:09
Lol that made me laugh and made sense all in one. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:48:27
No such thing as "signs are clear" no one knows lmfao. I agree with hodling, it's not "childish".
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:52:49
And "trevor" was autocorrect lol... my bad. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:21:21
No you're not, you're New here. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 04:32:38
I tried talking to my manager today about crypto and she was completely lost and uninterested lol, we have quite some ways to mass adoption if any. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:39:19
I heard some stuff about Trezor not being as safe? I didn't really look into it.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:10:42
I ordered it just now. I realized the glitch sent me back and didn't put the transaction through. And the email made it look like the order completed but just sends you back to payment. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:04:15
Coinbase has lower fees than that. And you can even transfer the USD to Gdax and purchase there for even lower fees.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:19:59
Yesterday mempool was still high.
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:27:09
Because I figured out of all the people on this sub somebody has purchased a Trezor wallet before.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:18:50
Okay thank you for clarifying, it was very helpful. Sorry if I'm pissing some people off with my lack of knowledge and use of terms, I'm still generally new but always learning new things. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:54:38
I mean as long as you make an offline wallet on that external harddrive (I use Electrum) you should be fine, but if you want to go the extra step and completely unplug that harddrive from your computer that's safe too. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:08:02
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:42:07
And that's a risk I'm willing to take if there's a possibility it goes much higher and then I'd live with that regret. Too bad no ones got a crystal ball yet, although people think they do.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:40:20
Yeah I think you're right with more. A month or so isn't a huge deal for me to keep using the wallets I'm using now or perhaps the mobile wallets. But thank you for actually responding to the original question. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:15:24
Did you mean hodling* his kid? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:46:59
Alright thanks for the info. I'll definitely look into it. If it's on Amazon and it's through Trezor themselves, would you say it's worth just to buy on there? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:52:00
I'm saying that I just read something about that topic for the ledger nano s, and since they're both similar, I was wondering if there's anything I'd have to do.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:18:32
Use Nicehash, converts whatever you mine to BTC for you, I make ~.007-~.001 BTC a day ($3-4.25). I have a 980 and a 970 and I use my CPU as well. As long as you have free electricity (I have solar power) it definitely adds up and and if you choose to sell it's a nice $21+ dollars a week for doing nothing :)
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:51:53
Let me contact the all-telling wizard.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:32:06
And thank you for taking the time to explain, and good luck to you too.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:47:21
Yup now you're making a bit more :) like I said, it sure adds up. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:27:35
That's pretty good! Are you using your CPU as well? That gets me an extra 40 cents a day or so..
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:09:55
lol me neither 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:32:54
Don't try to time the market. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:31:00
I use a debit card, but I don't think there is a difference. You transfer fiat to Coinbase, they don't take fees from debit, I doubt they would with credit. Good luck and welcome to crypto!
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:34:20
I'm assuming you meant hardware*, I just ordered a Trezor Wallet which should be coming in tomorrow. Trezor, if you read the reviews, seems to be one of the safest ways to store your bitcoin and other cryptos. If you're willing to spend 120+ (I bought mine on Amazon from SatoshiLabs for $120), it is one of your best choices. Also check out Ledger Nano S. But in the mean time, I have been using Electrum, it is also very secure but nothing is as secure as a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:41:04
Oh, and I'm holding the crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:40:17
I am on the exact same boat as you. 17 still in HS and turned $4500 into just about $17k. Welcome, brother. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:57:38
My dad sold GBTC. In my opinion, extremely unreliable. When bitcoin went to $5000 GBTC was at $1000. Then bitcoin dropped to $4000 and GBTC went to mid 500s. Bitcoin is now above $7000 and GBTC isn't even at $900. I would not mess with it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:56
I've invested in Monero (200% increase) which is my best other than Bitcoin. Ethereum and Litecoin are good choices as well. I'm bagholding OMG at the moment but broke even and it's only a small percentage of my portfolio. I'd take a look into monero if you wanted to diversify, very small market cap and a legitimate purpose behind it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:04:10
I'm 17 so I figured I would be able to share so personal experience. When I got into crypto last May, I bought ethereum and litecoin and tried trading them. I did no research and ended up losing over 30% of my investment and selling.
Fast forward to June, I decided to invest into crypto again and just hold, I bought 5 different coins that I had personally researched for hours upon hours on. And I've held that investment for around 5 months now and have made well over 3x my initial investment. And that money is about a year and a half of working a part-time job worth. (Ofc I'm still working the job ;) how could I buy more crypto?)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:37:14
Glad you feel the same way. It is a bullshit stock.
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:15:17
Congrats. I suppose you can predict the future too.

GDAX, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:34:30
Gimme a sec, lemme get the magic 8 ball. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:55:09
Personally I made a Coinbase account and bought off of GDAX. You can connect a debit or credit card, but that is the easiest way imo. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:27:10
3.99% and GDax has a .25% or something like that fee. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:25:28
This made me hysterical ngl
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:33:21
No need for the attitude. There are many reputable sites which are extremely easy to find. You probably should have done research before putting any amount of money into an exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:39:57
It's like .25% I believe. Connected straight to Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:04:38
I just send money from my debit card to Coinbase then transfer it straight over to GDAX, other than the 3-5 day wait it's not bad at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:47:12
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:10:39
Exactly right, sport!

@_date: 2017-07-30 19:15:40
Lol why 2$ 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:17:54
How much do you have rn that you can't make a transfer? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:16:48
Too low of an amount for what? Making a transfer? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:54:10
Lol, FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:19:14
Ah I see. If you have a computer you could mine for over 2$ a day depending on specs using nicehash. Although payout takes awhile. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 06:01:37
Hi, I transferred my BTC from Coinbase to electrum last week. You didn't specify how long you've been waiting; but if it's no more than a few hours I wouldn't worry. Transfers to electrum do not show up immediately, as long as you sent it to the right address you have no need to worry.
