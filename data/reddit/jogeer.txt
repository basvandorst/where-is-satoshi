Only sensible comment in this thread. 
Also the first image and BCH’s problem is that fewer and fewer people will be able to run a bitcoin node because of the increased hardware requirements which will lead to more centralization. 
If we ever want to compete with VISA’s 50,000tx/s it won’t be from going from 7 to 30 tx/s with increased blocksizes in my opinion.

Well I just found out about RSK when it was released like many people, let's not jump to conclusions just yet.
I get it, we all want to see the bitcoin space evolving but development takes time.

Actually, it is. Those are pull requests that can be made by anyone and as with any decent project it has to be reviewed. Do you think that giving everyone write access to Bitcoin would work out? I'm pretty sure it wouldn't.
I would like to see a graph like this for bcash, but nobody is able to find the open source repository for bcash and yet they call bitcoin centralized, the irony.

No, it can be done without a QR code scanning or sending out any mail or message.
Suppose you have a subscription with a mobile provider and he charges you each month. He can send a payment request to your wallet and once you will log in you will get an overview of all the services that have asked for a payment request. You can then approve with a single click or even automatic payments with limited amounts.

It would be great to see a proper simulation, I found [this medium post]( but it isn't a proper simulation with real world variables.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:13:16
Bigger blocks sounds nice because it's bitcoin in it's current state with faster transactions and lower fees but I think that 30 tx/s as they have now is just pushing the problem in front of you.
Both solutions will lead to more centralization, BCH because it needs bigger RAM and better hardware specifications and lightning because they will have to have enough cash in balance to be able to process high value transactions.
Lightning is a *possible* solution to the transaction problem while I think in the long run BCH won't be.

This is just so plain wrong, you are implying that the second image cant scale horizontally which it doesnt make any reference to.
Then you say that the second image is scaling vertically yet the pc that is shown is slower as the server. It just says we need less hardware improvements to scale.

What I sincerely hope is that I don’t need to open up a channel manually, that my bitcoin wallet handles it in the background and that the fundings in the channel are accounted to my balance.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:26:41
I'm not elaborate as I should be, sorry for that.
The auto topup could be done with an online wallet without having to turn your computer on.
With autosaving I mean almost the same as topup, at fixed intervals transferring an amount to another address. This could be a savings address where you would set aside a specified amount at fixed intervals.
Payments already exist in lightning clients but it's not really accessible for the public, I don't mean the technical side of it but rather the lightning wallet implementation could make it easy for everyone to use.
With the security I mean that for different addresses inside of a wallet you should be able to specify how you want them to be secured. If you have an address with 10 bitcoins you might want to choose multiple address signatures for every transaction made from that address or when an address has 0.1 bitcoin you might not want any security before sending out a payment for that address.
We have to make the technology appealing to the public and we have all the tools for it.

No battery power left, can you please explain what you mean exactly? Do you mean your phone keeping track of the blockchain? This is already solved in apps like Electrum where the blockchain is handled remotely, it's not really that user friendly yet, but it's a solution.
But you are right, maybe we should invent this system of 'paper notes' which we can exchange with each other, maybe with a value on it's face so we know exactly what we are paying.
All kidding aside, I don't think you understand the big picture of the phase that we are in right now. You have to see it as the blockchain really being the open protocol with what we are interacting currently, the security is in your hands and it's still not really user friendly or safe.
In the future, there will be companies coming up with all kinds of different payment methods, and I think that the paper notes is a system we want to get rid of. That's the real beauty of the system. Now only banks can program against their 'blockchain', or apps that want to interact with these system have to have permission to do so.
Take for example mint.com, a beautiful innovative service which makes it possible to track expenses, but they have to get the approval of banks that they want to interact with, with bitcoin you don't need any approval and you can build any system you want.
From how I see it, it's a financial revolution of the magnitude we can't understand yet.

It's actually the same thing, if a bank or exchange or whatever is insolvent, getting your funds out *in any way* is a 'bank run'. Their final goal is to withdraw the fiat and getting the money in their hands, not leaving it on the site. Normally exchanges shouldn't speculate with your money and just store them so it shouldn't be a problem for btc.

It's easy to say this when what happened happened and calling all Mt Gox. users stupid and don't forget that you and everyone on this subreddit are actively following the news around bitcoin, but that's not the majority of bitcoin users.
If this were to happen to another exchange, you will have responses like "I'm super smart because I didn't store my bitcoins on an exchange and everybody who didn't saw this coming is stupid".
I didn't use Mt. Gox ever and I know they screwed up on many levels but I didn't predict this worst case scenario and neither did you.

There was a whale buying into bitcoin, resulting in a very high buy wall. Once the smaller traders made a better bid the whale moved up with them resulting in the massive increase of the price.
Then there seemed to be and there still is an after-burn effect. What I think is that a lot of people that sold their bitcoins still had fiat on the exchange, waiting for the proper time to jump back in again and I think a lot of people did resulting in very high volume, even from the smaller transactions.

What I really think that he meant was that technically, it doesn't impose a threat to bitcoin, but it is a threat to adoption/price/news coverage. If he can choose between decentralized mining and centralized mining he would choose the former.
I'm selling a big part of my bitcoins and it could very well be that GHash.IO won't abuse this situation, but if they do, it might break the current trendline. I'll buy back in after a while once the dust settles.

Why are you guys downvoting, he's making a valid point.
Almost all transactions that bitstamp makes are off-chain transactions that happen only in their software but don't happen on the blockchain. The only time they need bitcoins in their hot wallet is while depositing/withdrawing bitcoins.
When there is more money being withdrawn than there are being deposited they would have to retrieve from their cold wallet so they do need some kind of a buffer but the $5 million seems way too large to have in their hot wallet.

With bitcoin you put a lot of responsibility to the users, it's like giving them a case full of cash and giving them the responsibility to keep it secure themselves. People don't really want to handle the security for these amounts of money themselves.
Right now the safest way to store bitcoins is a paper wallet, but non-technical people don't want to boot from a live CD to create a public/private key and keep it in a safe or in the bank. They are used to the security being handled properly for them by banks, they are only responsible for cash that they have on them.
If I take the analogy to banks and what I have today and what it would look like for bitcoin looks like this, it is open to discussion because I don't know myself what the best infrastructure would look like.
* Long term savings account: This should be a very highly secured wallet with most funds, only option should be to transfer funds to current account. Maybe add 2FA spanning multiple days and have a variety of options to choose from.
* Current account: From this account you can transfer funds to anywhere you want. Maybe you can add withdrawal limits yourself depending on your standard of living.
* Cash: On peoples phones/computers, less security with least funds.

It's not the last blow that we are going to have and even though it feels risky now to hold vast amounts of bitcoins, there is a reward connected with this risk, there have always been and numerous people made posts like yours and they were all wrong.

Bigger blocks lead to more centralization than lightning. Even though BCH has more tx/s it’s not a means of payment because of double spending, nobody wants to wait for 3 confirmations at the cash register before they are allowed to walk out of the store. With bitcoin and lightning you can do big transactions on the main net, they don’t need to be quick and small transactions on lightning network.
The most important part of a coin and the reason why there won’t be a more succesful coin than bitcoin next month is adoption. Even though you think some coin is superior because of x reason, nobody cares because nobody is using it.

That wouldn’t work because BTC can be divided more than 1 satoshi... you can have satoshicents

At first I also thought that there cannot be a blockchain without bitcoin but that's completely wrong, you have to see the blockchain as a combination of two different things.
* A payment system where value can be transmitted from one address to another
* A system to verify transactions that also lets bitcoins be 'discovered' until a finite amount of bitcoins has been reached.
Bitcoin now is a combination of these two types, but it will eventually evolve into the first model where it should be interesting enough to keep the network running with a distributed hashrate to keep the value alive.
It's possible to just create a distributed p2p system of the 1st type or extend it as well.
I doubt though that colored coins or branded type blockchains will have a future, for them it's easier to create centralised systems and I don't see any advantages in using a decentralised system over a centralised one.

When looking at the activity on github it's not to say it's *that* active. Totally understandable though when you have to do this in your spare time and combine this with work/personal life.

We still have to think about the strippers.. if there is no dollar bill anymore, will they be wearing QR codes? There are still some real world problems with bitcoin that need to be addressed asap.

My hands are itching to work on a bitcoin project, I have an idea to take on as a next project and this was something that was absolutely necessary to let users remain relatively unaffected by the currency swings.
Once I have free time on my hands I will drop you a DM, it will take a month or two. Great work!

Didn't know this kind of service already existed, that's absolutely amazing! Do you guys also have an api that developers can use to send payments? That would leverage mobile applications to quickly send in SEPA payments or quickly convert bitcoin to fiat for their own use.
Is your service currently invite only or is it in beta?

Try to use localbitcoins which works with an escrow service, it's pretty instant and the cost is relatively ok too.
It's funny that while trying to achieve bitcoins it's becoming very clear that the banking system and traditional instances are slow and intransparent.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:29:02
You have no idea when a transaction completes when making transfers with banks and it always takes at least one day, larger sums can take longer. I also had a painful process of trying to validate my account too (4th submission accepted @ bitstamp). So I bought at localbitcoins to get them sooner.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:22:09
This is actually a very good question, maybe bitcoin can evolve in that way too, to make transferring money easier behind the scenes.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:40:55
If this thing takes off, it will be worth much more than what it's currently valuated. Right now the price has settled for people who are speculating that this thing might become big and not for doing actual purchases. I hope that I never have to turn my bitcoin's into money again, that their value increases and that I will just use it as a payment method. We need more stores accepting them, more media coverage and it should be accessible for everyone, right now I really won't recommend it to my family who are not technical people. This has to change, we need some stable good verified services so that everyone can use it. I don't know if it will become big, but if it will, we are nowhere near the actual valuation.
