This idea is not new; but I don't know if there is an open source &amp; offline program like this, so I make it for fun.
You can find more info &amp; usage at the Github page.

To be honest, I think working in a pool like [LBC]( is the only viable way to "hack" a Bitcoin address, so try that if you really want to.

Don't worry, it's just a trivial library error, which doesn't affect the result; and I'm too lazy to fix it :3


We need speed, and printing key will cost a lot of time, so the program will print keys for the given list of addresses only.
Are you familiar with programming? You can check the code yourself to get the idea :D

I don't know, but they are an active group at bitcointalk.org, and looks trustworthy (though I haven't tried)

I think this program has different features when compare to Vanitygen or directory.io
This program can:
- Search Private Keys for given list of Bitcoin addresses. There are ~24M Bitcoin addresses with positive balance, and you can check for all of them at once.
- Search in random mode; or search sequentially from a specific number (means you can choose to start from your lucky number etc)
