Never look back at where you come from, only where you are going.

Teaching children at a young age how to manage money and what investing is and how to be a responsible investor is messed up? Explain how.
You have to understand Russia is a country being victimized by the US sanctions and the ONLY hope they have is through Crypto. If you havent been too busy watching CNN brainwash you into thinking that Russians hacked the elections and that they are the enemy, you would know that nothing could be more further from the truth. These are every day people like you and I, just trying to make a living. Most of the Russians over there dont give a crap about what their government does, they are only trying to survive. And being utterly hamstrung by the west and the US with the sanctions is making their quality of like life shit. What would you do as a country if a bully like the US, the UN, the EU, and Nato was controlling everything you did and leveraging sanction after sanction after sanction against you for merely existing.
Let me put it in a way that you can understand. The US~Russia relations are like this:
You: Hey I want to invest into BTC to try and make a better life for my family because the US dollar, which in reality is only worth $0.05 and is taxed 100 times is failing me and my family, so I will invest into crypto to escape financial slavery.
Bank: No we will not allow you to buy crypto because we dont like it for whatever reason, you have to leave the US or stay and stay dependant on the US dollar instead!
The Federation of Russia is only embracing crypto because the US banks and banks of the west are trying to control it and its people with the US dollar.
Maybe if you turned off CNN for once and did your own research and read non-liberal sites you would see that.
