Man, can't proofread even for a post proposing someone work on a paper with you? ;)

I know sometimes pointing out gender seems pedantic, but as a woman in crypto I am very excited and supportive to see other (way more talented) women in the space because I don't meet many other women that are into crypto. Seems like a largely untapped source of users that will be encouraged by people like u/entrepreneurharshita

Tribes? How fucking blatantly racist can you get? 
The article is about how in many African countries there are restrictions and shortages on currency, and bitcoin works for them. It's not saying "buy Bitcoin because Africans do." It's a topical article for a subreddit about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:59:36
WOAH. That seems like a really big deal, to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:30:04
What was the exact wording? I once had an issue with BofA not processing a coinbase transaction but ironically they insisted that coinbase wasn't on their list of restricted websites and it ended up being on coinbase's end. 
Were they definitive in saying it was BECAUSE it was crypto? Or was someone in customer service speculating?

I think the most consistent 'fact' about bitcoin that is both maligned and celebrated is that it is wildly inconsistent and has the ability to surprise both its proponents and naysayers. To say that a bunch of people agree that 11.5 is btc's floor means nothing. It's volatile, and that's what made some people billionaires but caused others to lose out this past day.

Something I find 'fun' about bitcoin is that you can enter at any amount. You can buy a small fraction of a bitcoin to watch what it does -- don't be afraid to invest, say, $200 to dip your toes in. 
It is NOT an all or nothing scenario. The first time I invested, I treated it like a trip to the casino. When I go to play poker, I play low stakes and promise myself a $300 limit that I consider 'gone' the minute I walk in. Do the same with bitcoin. Consider the money you invest to be 'gone' so you don't have disappointments. It makes it more fun :)

Why would it drop to 37%? Are you talking about the recent tax break vote, because I thought that wasn't coming into effect until 2019..
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:28
You could go find the million other posts identical to this one, that are also clogging the subreddit with whining about the lack of crypto news, or you can use google / twitter to find sources you trust and read them firsthand. 
At this point I find the whining and bitching way worse than the memes. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:13:39
I know. I just... love bitcoin. And simultaneously hate being "a part of it." I should be more respectful of my surroundings. Love you nerds!

I would ask more specific questions there, after reading.

"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:28
these posts are so corny. the only thing i hate about bitcoin is the absolute cheesiness of the community

This is incredible. I love all the comments. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:24:36
The title makes it seem like the OP needs the money for an unforeseen reason. As an American, my mind can only jump to something like a medical bill. Sure, it's reckless to invest money you don't have, but at the same time, I can't judge when someone needs to liquidate for a serious reason. Chill on making this sub so aggressive when it doesn't need to be. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:27:02
My personal feeling was that since I don't support it or believe in it, I didn't feel any emotions about selling it when it was around $3k. Granted I didn't have a TON to sell, but without faith, I just had no interest in holding it. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:15:26
It's honestly a bad combo of not understanding taxes *or* bitcoin so i'm double dumb

Hi everyone! I have a question! It's pretty dumb! 
I have held my bitcoin for a while, over a year or so. It's always been an amount that I could afford to lose, but right now I'm thinking of buying something for myself, and would like to cash out some of my bitcoin. Here's my question: 
If I take out an even number, let's say $1000, and I am in the tax bracket that pays 15% on capital gains, do I simple owe $150 at tax time? I don't know how much the $1000 initially cost, because I bought roughly $30~ week for a long time. Some of it was when it was at $2000 a coin, and some was when it was $19000 a coin! Is my question simple or complex? Thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:11:26
She, and thank you for articulating what I meant. (if that sounds sarcastic, it's not meant to be.) 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:09:43
Thanks for the thorough response. So buying small increments every week was kind of a nightmare of a decision. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:10:35
I feel dumb for not understanding it. Sorry if my preface annoyed ya. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:06:05
Thank you. i think that all makes sense. I almost am willing to pay a higher tax to not do any of this. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:12:45
* she -- so I can total my purchase amount (~$800 that is now worth ~$1300) and divide it by the amount of bitcoin I own? (.12) and my purchase price would be $6400 across the board? That makes sense to me, honestly.

To be honest, I'm pretty new too. I don't feel qualified to say anything but what I posted above

My bread account was just disabled until 11 am tomorrow after ONE pin entry (the correct pin, I'm fairly certain.) 
I haven't allowed anyone to even hold my phone in days.... is this a security breach? It's allowing me to change my pin by entering my 16 word code, but I want to know why it was disabled in the first place if I haven't made ANY incorrect pin entries recently. Is anyone else experiencing this?
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:49:47
Hey -- out of curiosity, what happened? I just experienced this and it won't let me back into my account until tomorrow at 11 am. I never entered my pin wrong. Hoping your story has a happy ending...
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:49:00
But I got disabled today and NEVER entered an incorrect pin?
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:25:11

@_date: 2017-09-26 01:47:02
That's okay!

Mine's fine, if that's any consolation. Check for updates. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:18:35
lol jesus christ... this is such an aggressive response. These kind of strange, almost inhuman responses to questions can't be good for making bitcoin accessible to normal people. 
u/jep777 you should get a wallet regardless of the fork. There are free ones, doesn't have to be hardware, though this community is conservatively wary and will probably push hardware. I use Breadwallet but am open to other suggestions. 
I'd wait for a better, less judgemental (and strange?) response than the one given by u/playful12. 
Sorry I don't have the best answers, just wanted to step in and give you a warmer welcome. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:38:52
my answer was similarly not to imply that there aren't tons of women already in bitcoin investing. More defending the impulse of OP to seek those women out and ask who they are :) 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:16:31
I think this is an interesting and important point to consider. As bitcoin enters mainstream conversation, it is important to evaluate what will make a convert, and for a lot of people the heavily-technical jargon, male, young dominated space might make it feel like it's "not for them." It's important for there to be a diversity in role models in any fledgling community. Asking those questions indicates that as adoption rates go up, the userbase will increasingly have drastically different demographics. I think it'd be rad if there were women role models to increase female interest, same with different races, ages, etc. 
And you'd have to be willfully missing the point if you think OP is asking if every bitcoin owner is male. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:49:15
It might be all he has to invest in something new, at this exact moment. 
Chill. He's not saying he just spent his last hundo that was meant to feed his 8 little brothers and sisters because papaw just died at the mine.
