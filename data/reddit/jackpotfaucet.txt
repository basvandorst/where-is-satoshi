What you do with your ad spaces is up to you. You can put Google Adsense there and make a healthy profit in quick time.

Can't tell if you are being facetious, but yes it costs 1 BTC and we cover all the hosting, admin, payments and we'll have more templates soon. All you do is drop in the ad code, pump some traffic and keep the faucet running.

Actually, we have quite a polished reputation among bitcoin users. We have paid out every week, on time, throughout our existence. Also, we have proof of the winners chosen by random drawing. They are located on the "winners" page at the top right. Besides, what do you have to lose? We give you 250 satoshi + 4 tickets to the drawing each time you successfully claim Free bitcoins. It's a winning proposition for you!
