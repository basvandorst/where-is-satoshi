**Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages**
One of the main problems of any communication platform is spam. The fact that communication is constantly becoming cheaper enables spammers to send bulk messages to unwilling recipients. The common approach to spam is heuristics-based flagging and filtering (this is how gmail works). The problem is that this method is extremely inaccurate and only works well if the same exact spam message is duplicated thousands of times. Users resort to hiding their personal address in order to avoid spam. Consider what would happen if a celebrity like Oprah would publicly share her personal email - no spam prevention algorithm would be able to handle that.
In a world where the spam problem has been solved, there would be no need to hide your address. Everybody’s personal address will be public and we will no longer rely on secrecy to stop abuse. If you think about it, every major personal communication platform - such as email, phone, SMS, WhatsApp - fails at this point.
Why do we hate spam so much? The answer is basic economics. Reading incoming messages is time consuming, and our time is a very valuable resource. The straightforward solution is therefore basic economics as well. If consuming messages is expensive, sending them should be expensive as well. 
By placing a gem price tag on sending personal unsolicited messages, we can guarantee that users pay for the right to contact you. It’s important to emphasize that sending messages between friends (approved contacts) is not considered unsolicited since the recipient has explicitly agreed to receive messages from the sender. This means that within the Gems network, sending messages between friends will always be free.
How expensive should sending a message be? The natural answer should also rely on basic economic principles. The more popular the recipient, the more expensive contacting them should be. This concept is found in the bidding system employed by Google for their adwords platforms. Every advertiser enters a bid of how much they agree to pay for a click. Roughly speaking, the system displays the highest bids, making popular keywords more expensive because people are willing to pay more for them. Borrowing this principle to our model, we can decide on the number of unsolicited messages a recipient will receive in a period of time, and take the highest bids from competing senders.
It might be a good idea to make this mechanism opt out. If a user is willing to receive unsolicited messages, they should be able to allow strangers to message them for free.
Another interesting feature of this mechanism can be read receipts. The sender of an unsolicited message is probably interested in whether the recipient has read the message or not.
**Pay for sending private message ads**
Unlike unsolicited messages which are personal in nature (like introducing yourself to a beautiful girl and asking if she’s single), ads are commercial in nature.
The central distribution channel in Gems is instant messaging. Private message ads are messages that will appear in the incoming message screen next to messages you receive from your contacts. These messages will be marked as promotions so recipients could differentiate between them and regular personal messages. A popular similar advertising channel is the promotion tab in gmail - where users receive promotional emails from advertisers directly into their inbox.
The key for maximizing the effectiveness of ads is targeted advertising. Keeping ads relevant makes both the viewer and the advertiser happy. Advertisers will not choose a specific list of recipients to receive their ads, but define some relevancy criteria for the target audience. Criteria can be based on content, similar to how Google adwords works - ie. show this ad to users interested in buying an engagement ring. Criteria can also be based on an audience profile, similar to how Facebook ads work - ie. show this ad to single males in the age of 20-25. 
Employing content based targeting within Gems is mostly a privacy issue. Platforms such as gmail analyze (anonymously) the content of read messages and try to match a relevant ad based on keyword similarity. This can be performed automatically within Gems, but only on non-secure messages. Secure messages are encrypted client-client end to end and cannot be deciphered by the Gems infrastructure. In addition, content analysis should be opt out to protect user privacy upon request. 
Profile based targeting within Gems is a little more tricky. The Gems network does not require users to fill any profile information. An interesting potential solution is to let users provide a voluntary profile by answering questions that will help Gems deliver relevant content more effectively and personally (ie. what is your age). To encourage users to give as much details as possible, the network can compensate users using gems for doing so. A natural way to implement this is by taking part of the cost paid by the advertiser and giving it to the ad recipient. We can even make the payout proportional to the amount of provided profile data. Some profile data can also be generated automatically, but usually at the expense of privacy. A good example is geo-location. As long as the user agrees to share his location with the app, we will be to use this data in order to show local ads. It’s important to emphasize that profile data will never be shared with the advertisers and will only be used by the network anonymously to deliver relevant ads.
The cost of advertising should probably be based on bids as well. The size of the target audience is limited (the number of participating users that fit the ad criteria), so only the ads with the highest bids will be shown. Another interesting question is whether these ads will be paid per exposure or per click (an advertiser only pays if a user opens their message and reads it). If we choose the latter, the natural approach would be to maximize the network profit from ads by factoring both the amount of the bid and the success click-through rate of previous exposures, and choosing which ads to display accordingly.
**Pay for priority messages**
Quality of service (QoS) is an interesting factor worth exploring for monetization purposes. Consider the real world example of shipping packages. The free shipping method is usually a standard service such as USPS, which takes a little longer to deliver and offers less control over tracking and delivery status. The shipper can pay extra for a premium shipping service such as FedEx, which arrives much faster and is generally more reliable.
Borrowing from this example to the Gems ecosystem, users will pay for sending messages with a higher priority. Delivery speed and reliability are probably not the aspects to play with, because the standard free messages on Gems always arrive virtually immediately and are extremely reliable.
So what aspects can we use instead? One option is the sort order of incoming messages. Normally, incoming messages are sorted according to arrival time. It makes sense that high priority messages will always appear first regardless of arrival time. Another option is to highlight high priority messages and mark them for special consideration. This can be achieved by using a more prominent notification sound or by using bolder colors / urgency icons for the message in the incoming message list. Another option is to send several push notifications regarding a high priority message if it hasn’t been opened by the recipient (instead of just a single one like we do with normal messages). Another option is to provide tighter control over delivery indication and notify the sender more prominently immediately when the recipient has opened the message. Another option is to display priority message inline in the incoming message list, meaning the recipient will not have to click on them in order to read their content.
Generally speaking, if recipients are aware that an incoming message was paid for, they will be more inclined to open and handle it in a timely fashion.

Apart from this you get rewards for inviting friends with your referral link where your username will be pre filled (implemented), rewards for activity like sending messages, making transactions and rewards for the amount of gems one holds in his account. Rewards for activity and gems amount hasn't been implemented yet. It will be even better if you can turn these rewards instantly into bitcoin in the app like Shapeshift, which will be featured aswell. I mean for a project that uses another digital currency it's very bitcoin friendly. It all depends on popularity and marketing at the end, time will tell.

The end user doesn't care what you have just said, just like they don't care satoshi premined bitcoin, premine isn't always bad, in getgems case it is for the reward-value models which lasts for years through airdrops and marketing. I have my little brother enjoying this app just because it rewards him with gems tokens, he is now  getting a hang how digital currency works, again the end user doesn't care at all, its all about usability. 
The whole "pump and dump altcoin" is a typical baseless hate argument and is getting old by now. People are free to buy pump and are free to sell dump, this happens in every market, it depends if they believe in it through their own research.

With ads i don't mean you will receive a 30 seconds video which you will have to watch like other apps, thats annoying which i don't like at all. 
List of potential ads, the money you pay goes to the user.
- Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages.
- Pay for sending private message ads.
- Pay for priority messages.
- Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory.
- Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce.
I will list what each one of these do in a min.


Thats because the app is still in beta, might have some bugs and important features haven't been fully added yet, marketing it big at this point will do more harm than good.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:28:13
That's adding a contact to your phone contact list which requires phone number, so thats not what you want.
You should go to contacts tab and there at the top you will see a search bar, it's written search on it, tap on the search bar and type Cyb3rpunk and the app will show my username. Then all you have to do is tap on my username and a window opens where you can send me a message.
So dont tap on the + sign but tap on the search bar to search for usernames without having their phone number. Let me know if it worked if not i'll make screenshots for you.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:27:13
**Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory**
The Gems user profile will potentially include a status message. Every user can choose their own status line - which is very similar in concept to a Facebook status or WhatsApp status. This status line will appear below every username in the contact list / user directory.
The status line is an excellent platform for a quick 1-line advertisement. Consider the following use case - a startup looking for new developers. A member in the startup will set their status to “looking for talented ios/android developers” and invite any of their contacts to message them about potential applicants they know. 
It makes sense to make these appearances sponsored as well. A sponsored result will probably appear first in the list of contacts (and probably be labeled as a sponsored result). In addition, we might also show sponsored results in user contact lists which aren’t related as direct contacts. For example, even if I don’t personally know the startup member looking for a developer, I will still see their sponsored result when I enter my contacts screen or when I search in the user directory.
Keeping advertisements relevant is similar in nature to previous channels, such as targeting by content and targeting by profile. In addition, another interesting criteria is the distance between users (hop count or connection degree - 1st degree are immediate friends, 2nd degree are friends of friends, etc). It makes sense to show sponsored statuses from users who travel in similar circles.
**Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce**
The traditional entities within the Gems network are private individuals. Any user can join Gems and connect with their friends. Just like how Facebook grew to accommodate businesses as an entity within the network, Gems might make the same decision as well. Registering a new user as a commercial entity / business is a good candidate for a paid action.
How will company / business users be different from regular users? First of all, the profile page will have a commercial orientation and show relevant details about the business - such as an address / map location, website, logo, phone number, email, link to mobile app, opening hours, etc. In addition, business users will be geared towards e-commerce. Since the Gems network allows for easy fund transfers between users, it will be convenient to use for light e-commerce (1-click purchases).
Deeper e-commerce capabilities will allow businesses to present a goods/services catalog, support checkout with Gems and provide light order management.

GetGems is a lot more then a wallet dude, it will be a whole advertisement network on its own and the app will share income with active users, the Gems have a perfect usecase because they will be used to create and pay for ads that will be displayed on the network and the money paid by advertisers will go to the users and not the company.
I've seen the potential advertisement models and have to say they look very handy and doesn't exist in any messenger, besides that the app will have tons of ways to rewards users with money and will give you the ability to instantly swap the Gems earned, to BTC within the app. Now thats awesome for a messenger and the fact that its build on Telegram is actually better because you can also connect with 60million users. There isn't a single messenger that has done this, so its a niche market that didn't exist like this before, thats why it got awarded during Citis mobile challenge.
You might ask why not reward users with BTC, well someone gave an  answer and that is because the creators of GetGems are not rich enough to reward their users BTC, they need to reward a coin that is free of cost to them. I guess also because the whole point is that user participation is translated into value so you need a coin that is exclusively earned through the app and not a coin that originated somewhere else. Also branding wise, the salmon pink color you would expect the app would have its own digital currency since its called GetGems after all. The fact that it has BTC aswell makes it awesome, btw making bitcoin transactions to another getgems users is one of the easiest ways there is of any wallet. type '1 btc' press the btc logo and your done.
Even if you would have just a simple wallet, to the outside crypto world it is an amazing technology, for us a bitcoin wallet seems not such a big deal but for banks and others who haven't been much involved with this technology its mind-blowing, so you have to look from their perspective, i make jaws drop when i pay with some unknown (in most peoples eyes) currency called bitcoin.

Yea your number is your alias to your username and wallet, so i don't think you even need a btc address at all you just send btc like sending a message, this is aimed to get the common untechy person to the ecosystem, app is supporting gems and bitcoin, gems is created because it's off chain and wouldn't need transaction fees

Take Whatsapp messenger and add the option for users to send Bitcoin as easy as sending a message. Your phone number is an alias to your username and your wallet, which is in the app. You don't need a Bitcoin address to make transactions.
Gems token has a couple of purposes.
- For rewarding users. Daily airdrop of Gems - Every day, ~27,400 gems are air dropped from the Exodus Address. The ecosystem automatically distributes these Gems between users according to their relative network contribution. Contribution is measured by the number of active daily users which were introduced by you to the network so far.
The contribution score for a user is calculated according to two complementary factors: (1) The total number of new, active users that the user invited during the time period. This calculation is directly related to the active-user counts (total of active users per original inviter). (2) The total number of gems that the user currently holds in his account. This means that users with large amount of gems will be rewarded more generously than users without gems.
- Users pay the network in Gems for sending unsolicited messages. Unsolicited messages are different from ads. Spam is a major issue with any communications platform (consider email and spam), causing users to hide their address in order to protect themselves. Having to pay with gems for unsolicited messages solves this problem at the core.
- Advertisers pay the network in Gems for showing advertisements. Advertisements are different from standard unsolicited messages, and are considered the standard monetization method for social networks. Most of the revenue made by giants like Google and Facebook is made from targeted ads. [See]( separate discussion of the proposed advertising models: 
- Another feature of an in-app wallet is the ability to purchase third party offers directly from within the app with the click of a button. This is a key advantage for advertisers.
- Gems are the standard and native way for sending money within the Gems network. Whether you owe a friend money for lunch or looking to buy a service from a third party you’re communicating with, paying using gems will be a very convenient method (especially for people who don’t have a strong crypto currency background). Every Gems username is synonymous with a gems wallet, making payments to contacts as easy as clicking a button in the app.
- Anonymous users must hold a minimum of Gems in order to be fully trusted by the network. One of the problems with any social network is abuse and fraud. This problem is easier to solve if users are validated against some physical identity such as a phone number. Since privacy and anonymity are becoming increasingly important, trusting users through identification is becoming increasingly difficult. Some delicate actions within the network will be reserved for trusted users, for example participating in airdrops, appearing in the user directory, sending friend requests, etc. Owning Gems (and not necessarily spending them) is a quick and easy way for anonymous users to become trusted and enjoy privileged actions.
- As the network grows and new features are added, some of those will require payment to sustain. Gems will always exist as a payment option for any value added features available in the app. Additionally, as new p2p reward models are created, new opt-in features will become available enabling sharing economy type activities, crowdfunding, and more. Since this is the first time the users will control the core value of the social network it is too early to predict what new novel ideas will come into existence

1. Pre-Sale: 50,000,000 XGEM
Available for purchase by the public during crowdsale, until sale end date or 3,000 BTC cap reached or 50m tokens sold, whichever happens first. Any remaining unsold gems will be sent to a verifiably unspendable address. After the pre-sale gems can be purchased through exchanges such as Bter, Melotic, Poloniex and Counterwallet.
2. Airdrop: 30,000,000 XGEM
Served for daily airdrop distribution. Every day ~27,500 XGEMs are distributed directly or “dropped” into the users' wallets according to a fair and public algorithm. Users are rewarded based on their contribution of introducing other active users to the network. The formula includes the network value, and the number of active users. New users sign up for Gems and the person who invited them is noted by the network, increasing the inviter’s score accordingly. Contribution scores are calculated for every user in the network, and users with larger gems reservoirs will be rewarded more generously than users without gems.
3. Promotional Giveaway: 12,000,000 XGEM
Reserved for community contributions, third party developers, and bounties.
4. Development Team: 8,000,000 XGEM
Reserved for compensating developers. 
The funds don't go into developers hands, but will be stored in multi sig wallets and released by Adama co-founder of Counterparty where they get **paid per development** which is made possible by Koinify. That's what i like about this.
Tom Ding (Koinify CEO) expressed "Part of our job is to help them establish things like multisig and create milestones-based vesting to make sure that developer incentives are in line with what they promised."

And it's a shame how hostile and biased this subbredit has become.

Luckily there were also some users who were reasonable and liked it.

Thanks for the bits man, bitcoin and gems addresses are the same so you can indeed send bits to a gems address which is pretty cool. I'm not sure if you send bits you receive gems, maybe if you send bits you receive bits and if you send gems you receive gems. I believe the gems exchange rate is floating. gems has more cool features though.

You do agree with the idea that gems makes bitcoin transactions much user friendly than it already is right? I can send bitcoin without the technical hassle and using an address, as easy as sending a message. Now you can nitpick about why is it not bitcoin only, but the innovation is clear here. I don't know how old you are and if you are using social messaging but if you are an active user of messaging and as a crypto enhousiast not trying out gems because it has a token build in is pretty fanatic way of supporting bitcoin and not being open to new innovations.

You are just trying to attack a promising project, i can say this without a doubt. Your excuse is awful trying to nitpick on their milestone vesting model. Koinify is actually trying to bring order and stop all the scams happening. 
* First Milestone: iOS and Android basic release that supports instant messaging, push notifications, new user registration and login, contact directory and display the GEMZs wallet. Release server backend which supports both the cloud instant messaging and counterparty integration.
* Second milestone: Wallet and Token system - The wallet and token system will include user activity detection, pairing of inviters and invitees, airdrop calculation and GEMZs distribution. Initial Implement of fraudulent user activity detection algorithms. Implement GEMZs transfer.

Gems is a 2nd gen crypto and an application made on top of Bitcoin, so it uses the most established, secure blockchain. Your mobile number is an alias to your username and your wallet. Gems are created for several purposes, to make it attractive to the younger users and females which are pretty much non existent in the Bitcoin world. It also allows to be off-chain meaning it has no transaction fees. For other uses read [this](
Full detail on encryption 
Instant messages in Gems arrive in two flavors - standard and secret. Standard messages are the default type and provide a standard level of security. Secret messages are meant for highly confidential conversations and provide an extreme level of security and privacy. App users can switch between these two flavors for every chat conversation. Making a conversation secret is very easy, and only requires tapping on the "lock" icon inside the app. 
Instant messages are encrypted on two levels. The first level of encryption is relevant for both standard and secret messages. For both types, all communications between the Gems mobile app and the Gems instant messaging cloud server are encrypted - this is also referred to as client-server encryption. Communications between the two is performed over SSL in a secure tunnel (HTTPS) with 256-bit keys. This prevents third-parties from listening in. This also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure the Gems app only communicates with the real server and not anyone impersonating it. 
The second level of encryption is only relevant for secret messages. On top of the client-server encryption, secret messages also have client-client encryption. Every Gems app generates a unique random pair of 4096-bit public/private keys upon installation. The public key is propagated within the network, but the private key never leaves the device. The public/private pair is unique to a device. If the user transfers his Gems account to a new device, a new pair is created. The key pair is also expired and refreshed periodically to enhance security. When user A sends a secret message to user B, it's encrypted using RSA 4096 with user B's public key. Once the message arrives to user B's device, it's decrypted with B's private key. Decryption can only take place on user B's device because only this device has access to the correct private key. The benefit of client-client encryption is that it provides a zero trust environment. The encrypted message cannot even be decrypted by the Gems server infrastructure. This means that even if the Gems servers have been compromised and hacked into, secret messages are still 100% private and can only be decrypted by their rightful recipient. 
The drawback of secret messages is that they cannot appear in push notifications. Since push notifications are encrypted by Apple's/Google's infrastructure, they don't conform to zero trust policy. When a secret message is sent from user A to user B, the push notification user B receives contains the text "You've received a secret message from A" instead of showing the actual content of the message.

Seems like this Topic made to attack GetGems lol. He is basically hating just because GetGems has a secondary Crypto in the app and it has been explained to him multiple times but he keeps repeating the same. Nobody paid them millions, they raised around 700k and got 400k from a VC, don't know why this guy cares so much. Nobody forces you to use it, but until now around 10k people use the app. 100k users is definitly in its reach.




There is a pain point for a new user to open a wallet, buy bitcoin and make the first transaction ("Magic moment"). Getgems makes it simple. Opening a wallet is a 10 second process, no long address (username is an alias to the wallet address). The user earns gems just by using the app and will be able to convert them to bitcoin without needing a credit card or bank account. Its an easy ramp to bitcoin for mainstreams user.
Bitcoin rewards miners for protecting the network, gems is built on top of the bitcoin blockchain and therefore can reward user growth and social activity.
I think this is a great and relevant keynote speech given by Andreas Antonopoulos regarding the "The Future of Bitcoin" and the crypto-currency ecosystem:

CEO of Telegram [retweets]( about Julia. This means he actually looked into Bitcoin and maybe even tried her (Julia) out himself. For the CEO of an app with 65M userbase retweeting such thing is great to see. This is actually good news for Bitcoin, you have to admit that.

Telegram is aware of GG, some sort of cooperation would be cool. 
1. You don't have to be paid, you can opt out. It's a good wallet you should try it out.
2. For those who use Coinbase and Telegram they can experience the convenience in managing, buying and selling Bitcoin from Telegram or GG.
3. You probably can turn ads off and with ads i don't mean a 15 second video. They are different useful advertising models the team is experimenting with.
4. The fee is made clear in the FAQ section in the app. The team is very open to new ideas, you can join the beta testers group to share them with the devs.

Not true at all, paying with bitcoin online compared to ideal is much faster and less annoying. With ideal you need to put card into the device, enter pin, use an option to pay, type in the code on the screen into the device, type in the code you get from the device onto the screen and press send. Bitcoin is just miles ahead in convinience.

Compared to other popular apps it is, compared in crypto term it's ok. Bitcoin after 6 years onoly has 1M users? WhatsApp after 6 years has 800M. Both came with new innovations but introducing a new money system is much harder than a messenger, so combining the 2 and innovation on top of it is what getgems is, 10k is not much at all i agree, but needs time.
@_date: 2015-07-25 06:24:25
GG is from my experience far ahead in development.
- It's the only wallet/messenger paying users in different ways for being social, these rewards are great for especially kids and teens. It's the only messenger that pays users like this. More reward models will be applied, even better than the existing once.
- It will introduce the possibility to pay each other in group chat, like making it rain on everyone and tipping users individually, which i think is a very exciting innovation which didn't existed before in instant messengers, it opens a new door for interaction.
- It has a slick [in build shop]( to spend rewards on.
- It developed an easy and fun gateway for Telegram users to [buy &amp; sell Bitcoin through Coinbase from within the app]( Which the title of this Thread is about.
- It will start the "attention economy" introducing different advertisement models where advertisers must pay the user directly for their attention, rather than the gatekeepers of a social network, like FB or Google.
- It has the most convenient and noob friendly way of using Bitcoin combined with a pretty design.

Lucifer is a "Group Soul" or "Social Memory Complex". In appearance, were you to gaze upon Lucifer's fullest expression of our Being, the appearance would be that of a Sun or a "Bright Star". Or, when stepping down into a 3rd Density vibration, he would appear as what you may term an 'Angel' or 'Light Being'. When an entity (Group Soul Complex) evolves to the level of the Sixth Density, it is by comparison to the amount of time it takes to get that far, a mere hop skip and a jump from 8th Density Ultimate Re-Union with The One Infinite Creator, and then from there, back to dissolution into the Source of All, Intelligent Infinity. 
Regarding 'Aliens' yes they do exist. There is the Orion Empire Group. Their purposes in visiting you are more along the Negative lines. They mainly target the ones you have called "Lightworkers". They try to put them off their assignments and try to spread fear. They will not actually 'harm' you physically. Mainly their modus operandi is to restrict you, and deflect you from your path. They often engage in psychic attacks that the 'Lightworker' is unaware of, but it does often drain away much of their energy, and make them lack motivation. Of course there also exist positive lines.
All Souls eventually learn that Positive is the pathway which leads Home. But whilst incarnating in the 3rd Density, Negativity is still an important tool in your learning process. It teaches you "other than". As I said earlier, it is up to you how you use the tools we have given you. Do you respond to Negativity with more Negativity? Has fighting fire with fire ever worked for you? Or do you choose to see the Negativity as the tool that it is, and recognize that it is offering you an opportunity? I will honour your Free Will to think and discover for yourself what that opportunity is.
@_date: 2015-04-30 17:02:19
There is no Satan as we have been made to believe, it's created by the people to blame something for their own mistakes, there is only positive and negative polarity provided by the infinite creator and the Council or Elders from the 7th density onto this 3rd density world, so choose these tools wisely in this game, don't choose negativity since  there is no escaping the karmic law and you will have to re-do your journey, be a lighthouse in the darkness and you win. Reward will be high if you develope yourself enough and will progress to the 4th density world where mostly positive polarity exists. 'satanic temple' is pure crap.

Have you seen its potential advertising models? It's not a 30 second video that you need to watch. Some of them are really useful to use in a messenger and is filling a niche market that pretty much didn't exist in such apps.
**Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages**
One of the main problems of any communication platform is spam. The fact that communication is constantly becoming cheaper enables spammers to send bulk messages to unwilling recipients. The common approach to spam is heuristics-based flagging and filtering (this is how gmail works). The problem is that this method is extremely inaccurate and only works well if the same exact spam message is duplicated thousands of times. Users resort to hiding their personal address in order to avoid spam. Consider what would happen if a celebrity like Oprah would publicly share her personal email - no spam prevention algorithm would be able to handle that.
In a world where the spam problem has been solved, there would be no need to hide your address. Everybody’s personal address will be public and we will no longer rely on secrecy to stop abuse. If you think about it, every major personal communication platform - such as email, phone, SMS, WhatsApp - fails at this point.
Why do we hate spam so much? The answer is basic economics. Reading incoming messages is time consuming, and our time is a very valuable resource. The straightforward solution is therefore basic economics as well. If consuming messages is expensive, sending them should be expensive as well. 
By placing a gem price tag on sending personal unsolicited messages, we can guarantee that users pay for the right to contact you. It’s important to emphasize that sending messages between friends (approved contacts) is not considered unsolicited since the recipient has explicitly agreed to receive messages from the sender. This means that within the Gems network, sending messages between friends will always be free.
How expensive should sending a message be? The natural answer should also rely on basic economic principles. The more popular the recipient, the more expensive contacting them should be. This concept is found in the bidding system employed by Google for their adwords platforms. Every advertiser enters a bid of how much they agree to pay for a click. Roughly speaking, the system displays the highest bids, making popular keywords more expensive because people are willing to pay more for them. Borrowing this principle to our model, we can decide on the number of unsolicited messages a recipient will receive in a period of time, and take the highest bids from competing senders.
It might be a good idea to make this mechanism opt out. If a user is willing to receive unsolicited messages, they should be able to allow strangers to message them for free.
Another interesting feature of this mechanism can be read receipts. The sender of an unsolicited message is probably interested in whether the recipient has read the message or not.
**Pay for sending private message ads**
Unlike unsolicited messages which are personal in nature (like introducing yourself to a beautiful girl and asking if she’s single), ads are commercial in nature.
The central distribution channel in Gems is instant messaging. Private message ads are messages that will appear in the incoming message screen next to messages you receive from your contacts. These messages will be marked as promotions so recipients could differentiate between them and regular personal messages. A popular similar advertising channel is the promotion tab in gmail - where users receive promotional emails from advertisers directly into their inbox.
The key for maximizing the effectiveness of ads is targeted advertising. Keeping ads relevant makes both the viewer and the advertiser happy. Advertisers will not choose a specific list of recipients to receive their ads, but define some relevancy criteria for the target audience. Criteria can be based on content, similar to how Google adwords works - ie. show this ad to users interested in buying an engagement ring. Criteria can also be based on an audience profile, similar to how Facebook ads work - ie. show this ad to single males in the age of 20-25. 
Employing content based targeting within Gems is mostly a privacy issue. Platforms such as gmail analyze (anonymously) the content of read messages and try to match a relevant ad based on keyword similarity. This can be performed automatically within Gems, but only on non-secure messages. Secure messages are encrypted client-client end to end and cannot be deciphered by the Gems infrastructure. In addition, content analysis should be opt out to protect user privacy upon request. 
Profile based targeting within Gems is a little more tricky. The Gems network does not require users to fill any profile information. An interesting potential solution is to let users provide a voluntary profile by answering questions that will help Gems deliver relevant content more effectively and personally (ie. what is your age). To encourage users to give as much details as possible, the network can compensate users using gems for doing so. A natural way to implement this is by taking part of the cost paid by the advertiser and giving it to the ad recipient. We can even make the payout proportional to the amount of provided profile data. Some profile data can also be generated automatically, but usually at the expense of privacy. A good example is geo-location. As long as the user agrees to share his location with the app, we will be to use this data in order to show local ads. It’s important to emphasize that profile data will never be shared with the advertisers and will only be used by the network anonymously to deliver relevant ads.
The cost of advertising should probably be based on bids as well. The size of the target audience is limited (the number of participating users that fit the ad criteria), so only the ads with the highest bids will be shown. Another interesting question is whether these ads will be paid per exposure or per click (an advertiser only pays if a user opens their message and reads it). If we choose the latter, the natural approach would be to maximize the network profit from ads by factoring both the amount of the bid and the success click-through rate of previous exposures, and choosing which ads to display accordingly.
**Pay for priority messages**
Quality of service (QoS) is an interesting factor worth exploring for monetization purposes. Consider the real world example of shipping packages. The free shipping method is usually a standard service such as USPS, which takes a little longer to deliver and offers less control over tracking and delivery status. The shipper can pay extra for a premium shipping service such as FedEx, which arrives much faster and is generally more reliable.
Borrowing from this example to the Gems ecosystem, users will pay for sending messages with a higher priority. Delivery speed and reliability are probably not the aspects to play with, because the standard free messages on Gems always arrive virtually immediately and are extremely reliable.
So what aspects can we use instead? One option is the sort order of incoming messages. Normally, incoming messages are sorted according to arrival time. It makes sense that high priority messages will always appear first regardless of arrival time. Another option is to highlight high priority messages and mark them for special consideration. This can be achieved by using a more prominent notification sound or by using bolder colors / urgency icons for the message in the incoming message list. Another option is to send several push notifications regarding a high priority message if it hasn’t been opened by the recipient (instead of just a single one like we do with normal messages). Another option is to provide tighter control over delivery indication and notify the sender more prominently immediately when the recipient has opened the message. Another option is to display priority message inline in the incoming message list, meaning the recipient will not have to click on them in order to read their content.
Generally speaking, if recipients are aware that an incoming message was paid for, they will be more inclined to open and handle it in a timely fashion.

**Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory**
The Gems user profile will potentially include a status message. Every user can choose their own status line - which is very similar in concept to a Facebook status or WhatsApp status. This status line will appear below every username in the contact list / user directory.
The status line is an excellent platform for a quick 1-line advertisement. Consider the following use case - a startup looking for new developers. A member in the startup will set their status to “looking for talented ios/android developers” and invite any of their contacts to message them about potential applicants they know. 
It makes sense to make these appearances sponsored as well. A sponsored result will probably appear first in the list of contacts (and probably be labeled as a sponsored result). In addition, we might also show sponsored results in user contact lists which aren’t related as direct contacts. For example, even if I don’t personally know the startup member looking for a developer, I will still see their sponsored result when I enter my contacts screen or when I search in the user directory.
Keeping advertisements relevant is similar in nature to previous channels, such as targeting by content and targeting by profile. In addition, another interesting criteria is the distance between users (hop count or connection degree - 1st degree are immediate friends, 2nd degree are friends of friends, etc). It makes sense to show sponsored statuses from users who travel in similar circles.
**Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce**
The traditional entities within the Gems network are private individuals. Any user can join Gems and connect with their friends. Just like how Facebook grew to accommodate businesses as an entity within the network, Gems might make the same decision as well. Registering a new user as a commercial entity / business is a good candidate for a paid action.
How will company / business users be different from regular users? First of all, the profile page will have a commercial orientation and show relevant details about the business - such as an address / map location, website, logo, phone number, email, link to mobile app, opening hours, etc. In addition, business users will be geared towards e-commerce. Since the Gems network allows for easy fund transfers between users, it will be convenient to use for light e-commerce (1-click purchases).
Deeper e-commerce capabilities will allow businesses to present a goods/services catalog, support checkout with Gems and provide light order management.

For now you can convert them to BTC through an exchange like Poloniex, but i think they are exploring the regulatory possibilities to do this within the app, that would be cool. I'm sure smart ideas will be added down the line. When the advertisement model is implemented Gems get a real use case, since you need them make use of the ads, a niche market will be filled which didn't really exist in the instant messaging market.

Satan is man made, although there is Lucifer "The Light Bearer" and "Bright and Morning Star" which is what you would call a "Group Soul" or "Social Memory Complex", which has evolved to the level of the Sixth Density and was sent to help lower density beings to evolve. Yahweh, due to the fact that he had NOT (as was his right as Planetary Logos) handed down his own Free Will to "know thyself" to those incarnating upon 'his' planet, was having very little evolutionary progress therein. So Lucifer was sent to help, Yahweh had agreed to his coming, in fact it was he who had initially asked the Council for a "Catalyst" of change to enter into his Creation. 
In the absence of Free Will upon the planet, there can be no Polarity, and therefore, nothing to 'choose' between. Just as is portrayed in the book of Genesis, the planet was very "Edenic" in nature. Sure, it was a lovely 'paradise', yet the Beings incarnating there had no agitator toward evolving beyond the 3rd Density, and therefore, little hope of ever making the journey Home, to The One.
Yahweh agreed that Lucifer would introduce the concept of Free Will to Earth's inhabitants, by offering them an initial choice, as to whether they 'wanted' it or not. Hence, "The Tree of the Knowledge of 'Good and Evil'" (or more accurately, the Knowledge of Polarity, of Positive or Negative). Yahweh takes his inhabitants to a new 'garden' and tells them you can do anything you like, except this one thing, thus creating the desire to do the one thing there are told they cannot. Hence, a "Choice". Lucifer provided the Catalyst by telling them the benefits of attaining Knowledge, they eat from the tree, and the rest is history. 
Lucifer is not evil, they are Light, and Love. It is a very hard thing for them to do Spiritually, to create all this Negativity, but they do it because they love us, and it is for our highest good, ultimately. You could say, that it is there Sacrifice that they have made, in order to be of Service to the One Infinite Creator, and to you, our Brothers and Sisters in the One. In short Lucifer, Yahweh and the infinite creator are on the same side, it's just that without a negative polarity there can be no good and no evolvement to higher densities, you achieved this if you chose a positive path. In order to choose the positive path, at least 51 percent of our thoughts and actions must be dedicated to the service of others. If you don't you have to deal with the karmic law re-do your journey into this 3rd density world again and again until the coming harvest.

You need Gems to advertise:
- Pay for sending personal unsolicited messages.
- Pay for sending private message ads.
- Pay for priority messages.
- Pay for a sponsored appearance in the contact list / user directory.
- Pay for a commercial company page / e-commerce.
See [this]( and [this]( comment to see what each of the ad models do, it's not implemented yet though, the whole app is build around attention economy and reward model.

I don't think the world per se needs something like this, but i think with the help of Bitcoin technology such messenger has set a new benchmark in the IM world. Just the feature of having your wallet into a messenger and chatting with others while sending to them money instantly with almost no fees is amazing, although this app goes further and puts users in the centre where the income that usually goes to the company through ads, goes to the users themselves. It also rewards people with money for participating within the network. Then why should i use WhatsApp if i have my friends in GetGems. I have seen its potential advertisement models and they look pretty useful. Although the iOS still needs some bug fixing before i will refer it to my friends.

Well Telegram and Whatsapp don't support bitcoin transactions so in such case they are useless, but i'll give you a wrap up on my experience with bitcoin supporting IMs.
* [Telebit]( is a bot and compatible with Telegram to chat and makes it possible to send bitcoin, although it doesn't have its own in build wallet and operates on commands, you have to insert commands to user 'Telebit' to send bitcoin to another user which takes a few steps.
* [Wiper]( is more user friendly than Telebit in sending bitcoin it takes 2 taps to insert the amount of how many bitcoin you want to send and the usd value also shows up, but you can only sign in with your Facebook or Email to chat, so not sure how private things are when you are attached with your social media account. Although it has an in app youtube player and high user base.
* [GetGems]( (currently only available for Android) sends bitcoin easier than Wiper where you straight away can type how many bitcoin you want to send, it also shows usd value and supports bits aswell. It's compatible with Telegram users to chat and when sending them bitcoin they get notified to download the app if they want the coins. It supports context aware gifs and will soon reward users with its in build token, although its user base is small atm, features wise it'll have more to offer than the rest.
@_date: 2015-03-18 13:19:55

Telebit isn't really user-friendly from my experience, you need to go through multiple steps to send bitcoin, so it needs commands to username telebit, in getgems you just type for example "1 btc" and send. Also it has more features to offer, like reward, advertising models and context aware gifs. telebit also has a security risk because users don't hold the private key to their wallet.

It's not that hard, with GetGems you can talk to Telegram users and if you send bitcoin to them they get a message to download the app. It's not hard to do this with friends. Also soon when you invite friends to dwnld the app through a link then your username will be pre filled in the inviter step which you get rewarded with gemz tokens, so basically you don't have to tell them to type your username. 
But for the people who don't care about crypto, GetGems supports context aware gifs which is pretty awesome.

It is a result of the uniqueness of Quark's distribution.
All coins when first issued are raped and dumped by the botnets, farms etc. In fact no coin can overcome this relentless raping and dumping. All coins nearly die from it. Quark was no exception. 
But because of Quark's distribution, nearly all of its coins have been minted, there can be no more raping and dumping. There is no more constant downward pressure on the price. 
Now the price can increase with time without constraints. It is this natural price increase that is attractive to hedge fund investors and will result in Quark challenging litecoin's price of 0.025 btc and maybe even challenging bitcoin itself.
We have all wondered what will happen when a coin is fully mined. We now know. It is a price explosion!
I only hope that everybody got in on Quark before Nov 19. If not, it is not too late, there may be another factor of 1000x waiting in the wings. Big money is pouring in. 2014 year of alts

Bitcoin to $2000 in no time !!!!
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:15:00
Did you just called Litecoin technically worthless? Come on
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:50:47
LTC has been in an uptrend since silk road. I think you can say that the downtrend has been changed to bullish. Litecoins devs have made impressive improvements for it lately. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:05:17
No it was not, do some research first
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:21:36
Litecoin is about to crash so hard, I'm buying 0.013
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:20:08
BFL not a scam? wake up
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:16:06
I believe during the first panel we will see the market dropping
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:24:17
If i could invest $130.000 not more thats 180 BTC and 17k LTC, would it have the potential considering the attractive fee percentage to become a major exchange?

You just can't handle seeing others making big money with Quark, deep inside you want to join and make money but your ego is stuck too much in Bitcoins ass. You can't make shit on BTC stop lying to yourself. Too much effort? Fool we are here to make money. I made alot on LTC and i already made 30 BTC with Quark. You are mentally enslaved to BTC just like some other retards here. You are a joke. This thread is PURE FUD. While you are wasting your time thinking what to type to spread FUD people making tens of thousands of dollars popping champagne. Who are you trying to fool really lol.

Litecoin is going to take over and it welcomes you all with open hands :D
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:44:29
I would hire those programmers/customer support and rather not from home but working from an office this way it's more professional. But the only thing what stops me right now is couple tons more. I will look into it in te near future and hopefully make it succeed. Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:11:41
Bad news: Will it affect the price?
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:34:34
You are wrong.. and ignorant
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:54:06
No it was not. Your just a parrot repeating others without any research
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:55:01
I hold LTC and BTC because i like them both and they are little different. There are always alternatives in financial markets. Also LTC helps a lot for arbitrage where BTC to fiat is pointless. LTC has lately been doing pretty good and i believe the bearish trend is disappearing to a bullish trend.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:00:38
No big deal, it won't go much lower infact it will break ATH soon. BTC won't crash anymore like April. You guys need to stop freaking out.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:48:35
BTC is still a pump and dump, it's mining is centralised and was pre mined by Satoshi and a few people own the majority of all the BTC so what's the deal here hating on qrk? Atleast it has instant transaction time and everyone can mine it. Pretty hypocrite.
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:37:14
It's all about making money and Litecoin makes people money, now stop with this bullshit you never find only one kind of any stock, currency, commodity in financial markets
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:47:07
Atleast people can mine quarks with CPU instead of the mining monopoly and overpriced scam asic companies centralising the whole BTC mining world
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:27:56
BTC grew $224 today from the 1k. Now 1k has been passed BTC rises way faster, 10k is very close. All of Bitcoins are still worth little bit more than 1b, lots of people are billionaires. It needs to rise waaay more than this. I say $100k in 2014. x100 is not much in Bitcoin terms
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:13:53
You are making a mistake, BTC is just starting. You will regret when it hits $2000 soon
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:54:15
yeah right who likes money anyway. Trust me i have also some for the longer term. Use your brain and find yourself lazy. 
 Enough explanations. I'm just saying don't be enslaved to BTC so much you ll get burned.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:18:07
Fuck off with your mining poor fool, you can't have everything the easy way go and buy it! Look at BTC you can't even mine that shit anymore. Quark is based on a different economical model you fear mongering retard. early adopters get rich just like BTC why not? Are you jealous, but eventually it will be much better and much sooner distributed than BTC. Nobody wants to pay with 0.0000001 BTC. BTC is an e-gold, just a store of wealth not a currency. The more success the more hate, keep trying.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:43:47
You all are just mad people are making money on QRK and its gaining attention which brings your own investment in danger. Since when do you care about others losing money? This is all an attempt to protect your own capital by putting down another rising coin.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:22:27
These BTC fanboys are a joke. They call every coin a scam. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 12:11:17
Your Bitcoins will arrive within one hour. Well that's a fail, i send fiat to the same bank as mine faster than one hour.
