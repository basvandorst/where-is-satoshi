Well I’ve sold, bought, traded, experimented with alt coins, invested more in dips. It’s taken a bit but I’m learning the ways.

We understand the argument, we just don’t accept it! Only one Bitcoin.

Now I see why we can’t get along. Everyone acts as if they were experts on the matter and in reality THEY DON’T KNOW SHIT! I’m no expert on the matter but I could spot bullshit a mile away. Bitcoins market cap is 150 billon bitcoin trash is 25 billon. That says it all. Fuck getting along it’s war.

Why can’t we all just get along? I wish BCH embraced its differences from Bitcoin. Beat it by having a better product not by tricking the public.

I would like to see a Braveheart gif, coin icons covering soldiers heads Mel telling them to “hold”. Just saying.
