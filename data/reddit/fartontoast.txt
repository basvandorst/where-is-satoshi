But you missed the most important point. How does one generate an offline paper wallet safely? 
You need an air-gapped computer correct? But how do you get the software that will generate the key for you on this air-gapped computer? You surely will need to transfer it from a computer that's already been connected to the internet and hence could already potentially be compromised even if it has a freshly OS installed on and the network card ripped out. Since we know malware can affect bios now and even fester itself into hardware. Either way you need to get on the internet to get that piece of software one way or another and you risk that piece of software being compromised and compromising your seed even if it's been generated on the air-gapped computer.
So it's a catch-22 unless you know how to deal with algorithms and commands which will enable you to generate the address yourself, you're probably going to screw up one way or another trying this method.
And how does one transfer coins from it when the time comes? Many people are oblivious to this process and it almost seems like you need to know exactly what you're doing and be somewhat of a computet expert/programmer in order to go that route. There is a lot of room for error and mistakes.
I could be wrong and would be curious to hear your side of things.

Could you clarify/elaborate point number 2?

Could you educate me on how it was an attack?

Too bad this didn't get any visibility as I would have been interested in what people in this sub had to say about it.

Well said.

Could you define what makes someone a "shill"? As an observer coming in from the outside, wouldn't you supporting your view be also considered "shilling" your side? I'm just trying to understand the difference. I don't think it's healthy to be so quick to create labels as that causes even more divisiveness in an already fractured community.

Is it a reputable exchange?
Have you tried QuadrigaCX? Maybe you can get more answers from if you're trying to purchase from a Canadian financial institution.

There is an app called "Cheapest Bitcoin" on the play store. It is made by a redditor. Get it if you have an Android. I'm not sure if an iOS version exists. It basically lets you know on one screen everywhere where you can buy in CAD, for how much, which paying methods and how much % fee.
Alright so there are 2 exchanges that I would recommend you sign up for. Please note that I'm not affiliated with any of the exchanges and I'm just trying to help you get started. Those 2 would be Coinbase and QCX.
**Limits:** You will have something like a $150-$200 weekly limit (or biweekly, I can't remember). This cannot be raised for Canadians as I inquired about it already. If you do buy a lot from them they will eventually raise your limit to like $250. 
**Payment method:** They only accept credit cards. You also cannot trade/sell on Coinbase, at least as a Canadian.   
**Verification:**  You will need to upload an ID but the verification process is almost instant. You may or may not get a call from your financial institution asking if you made a purchase there. Just authorize it. $200 ain't much but it will let you in the game earlier so at least you will have something. Sign up today and you can have $200 worth of BTC by today. It's not much but it's something. 
If you are looking to spend more than that, which your title suggests, then I would recommend to get a QuadrigaCX account. 
**Verification and Limits:** There are 2 levels of verification. Make sure you don't fail your Equifax verification as it will give higher limits. You will also need to upload an ID and maybe even a photo of yourself holding the ID. You should get on that ASAP if you feel comfortable doing so because they are getting something like a 2000% spike in customers over the past few months so you may wait a week, two, or even a month, or maybe even more, to get verified. That's why I suggest to get on it ASAP because it will hurt to see the BTC price go up and you can't buy any because you are still waiting.
**Payment method:**  Once verified, you will basically need to transfer CAD into the account, which is called CAD Funding. There is a fee to fund the account unlike Coinbase that let's you buy BTC from them straight from your credit card. QCX charges a fee to fund the account rather than buying the BTC. AFTER you find the account in CAD, then you can buy BTC from a list of traders/sellers. 
Here is a link with all the funding info. 
They have some kind of bank wire option that supposedly takes 2-5 Business Days. I never bothered to use it because I constantly see posts on with people complaining their funds are stuck, missing, etc using that option. People end up waiting a long time to get the money back because something did not go through and they end up missing out buying BTC at a good price because they wanted to save on the funding fees. It's not always the case but I personally hate these risks that make me nervous not knowing what's happening with my 20k. Bank Wire just looks like a huge headache and risk. You don't really risk loosing the money but you risk loosing time, having it rejected because some detail was not filled out properly at the branch etc... Then QCX support will be a but slow to respond if anything ever arises. You gotta remember this is the wild wild west here and you can't expect the same level of customer service as we do from banks. Everything is still in its infancy stages. I try to minimize customer support involvement as much as I can, even if it costs extra money out of my pocket.
With that said, they have something called Electronic Funds Transfer which I'm not sure how it works but the limit is 10k and you can do it in two shots maybe if you wanna fund 20k. It takes 5 Business Days but I would assume it's safer than the Bank Wire. 
If you have an old interac online debit card without the visa logo, you can use the INTERAC® Online option which let's you fund your account instantly, and in some rare cases up to 24h. However the fee is 2.5% so I don't think it would make sense for you to pay 2.5% x 10 as you would need to deposit 2k ten times to fund 20k. I think it's the safest way if you wanna deposit like 5k fast but with 20k you probably should look into the Electronic Funds Transfer. I would avoid using the Crypto Capital option as well.
There is also an exchange called Kraken but I think they only accept Bank Wire for CAD.
There is one last option called. LocalBitCoins.ca. I think they take e-transfers and cash deposits. They take a fee for the p2p buying/selling between buyers and sellers. 
The bottom line is we Canadians have it much harder in terms of fees and flexibility than our American friends but it is what it is. The sooner you realize you have to take some losses as a Canadian the quicker you can stop missing out on good prices as BTC seems to be going up fast these days. A lot of people get too caught up in trying to find the cheapest, cheapest, cheapest method, which sometimes can take much longer and in the long term they actually miss out. I personally love the INTERAC® Online option because I get the peace of mind that my money has been received on their end, instantly. I had to go through 3 different branches to find a branch willing to give me an older card (without the visa logo) but it was worth it in the end. 
I hope perhaps there are cheaper options that I'm not aware of but most likely you will need to go through QCX. Maybe you can ask if people had a good experience with localbitcoins.com as I never tried to buy there. 
After you have your BTC, make sure you transfer it out to a personal wallet where you own the keys. This is something you will need to learn as you go along. But basically it comes down to having 20k on an exchange as pretty risky. There has been cases of people having their accounts frozen and they had to wait a very long time from client support to hear back. Basically it's a risk, because remember, this is still the wild wild west. You should learn different methods of storing your bitcoins and security, which is VERY important, but for now just try to get the funding part.

Just an idea. For future letters you can print the qr code. It'll make it easier for people to pay.

Is an online wallet fine?
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:08:37
I meant for 1 btc you owned you got 1 bitcoin cash in return, where as you stated the value of btc was "split" which made it sound like its price was split in half which isn't really the case.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:29:43
Kinda noob here. Didn't btc retain its value during last fork? Prices did drop pre-fork due to panic but that's all I remember. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:35:39
May I ask what people mean when they say "Assuming you own the private keys"?
I heard some exchanges also let you claim the new forked coin.
