And just like goods in markets, it's not you who awards them any value :)
Or should I say: They might be as worthless as your crypto unless you transfer it to FIAT...?

Yes, speculation. How many apples can be bought at those exchanges? How many people could buy apples with BTC per second? Marketcap is meaningless when it comes to the usability and that is what a currency should be - usable.

Just my 2 metaphorical cents.

But without Bitcoin, following your logic, there are currencies of the internet (ETH/LTC/...). It is the most popular one, but still, no currency as a medium of exchange. It is like gold. Or tulips in 1637.

No I just wanted to share my opinion. I know you don't like them but I personally hope those folks also get good gains from their investments. I don't get anything from wishing people bad things and am usually a more positive guy :)

So what is it like if it is not usable as a currency in the meaning of a medium of exchange? I mean you can't doubt that at the moment Bitcoin only serves as an object of speculation. 
Or do you think it is a usable currency?
Also, I'm not "working" on anything.

The thing is, a currency is usable when it's stable. You want to have roughly the same for your dollars as you get for them the next day. You can either have a investments and hope it skyrockets or you have a currency that is usable. You logically can not have both.
I don't know what these transactions are about. It could be one transaction of a trillion dollars from what you have written - your words dont serve any evidence for anything. 
Furthermoire, BTC is limited to a tiny ammount of transactions per seconds. If it was used in big scale, your trasaction would take way longer and would be way more expensive than using FIAT. Today, when you use Bitcoin to purchase cheap things, you pay higher fees than the value of the good. 
The rising value of bitcoin and *your* hope that it keeps rising is best proof that Bitcoin's main purpose is speculation.

Would you really want to spend the equivalent of 10$ worth in bitcoins when those spent bitcoins could be worth the double next day? Would you borrow the equivalent of 1000$ worth in bitcoin when you might have to pay back the worth of 10000$? 
The moon you're looking for is the hell for everyone that wants to really use Bitcoin as a currency.

Welp, sorry for every coin you lost :(

Unless you get BTC to the region of 1k transactions per seconds (1/20 of what Visa does and lower of what XRP is capable of) I don't think it can be seen as a viable currency on a big scale. And this is very far away from what i read about the current proposals to improve the tech. So I conclude that it will not be usable as a currency in the near future. 
I hope there will be a truly decentralized currency that can handle this.

Yeah but it certainly is not the currency of the internet as the sidebar says. That's it and all I wanted to say. Did you ever use your BTC to purchase any goods or services?
