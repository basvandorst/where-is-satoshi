The team is amazing, one of the fastest growing exchange I have ever seen. Bnb token is a long term hold and they distribute the gas from my NEO. Interface is user friendly overall my favourite exchange!

1 Satoshi = 1 Satoshi, fuck the dollar. Happy New Year everyone.

 A great way to ride the trend is using only moving averages, put the 55 and 200 EMA on your chart, 
Buy when the 55 crosses the 200 from under, and go short when the 55 crosses the 200 from above. 
This way you’re not perfectly timing top and bottom but atleast you got confirmation that you are trading into the trends direction. Backtest it on past year chart and see what your profit would have been.
