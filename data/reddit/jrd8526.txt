Maybe Gemini? Sell them on the exchange for USD, then withdrawal to your bank account. The fee on the exchange is 0.25%, I think.

Gold and silver prices are able to be manipulated by governments and central banks. I am no expert but from videos and podcasts I listen to they can sell paper gold/silver (short position) to keep the price of gold/silver down compared to the fiat currencies. They want to discourage people from holding the metals and encourage them to use the fiat currencies and attempt to hide the true devaluation of the fiat currencies that are taking place. They are unable to do this with bitcoin; if you want to sell bitcoin you must first actually own that bitcoin.

Gemini works well if you have a bank account.
You can buy bitcoin on their exchange for 0.25% fee

I have some in Jaxx and Copay wallets on my phone, and most of it in a Ledger Nano S.

Hopefully bitcoin was on Joe's mind because he is doing a little research in preparation for a soon approaching Andreas appearance.

He probably means the total value of all bitcoin vs. the total value of all gold. I often hear the market cap of gold is $7 trillion. The total market value of all bitcoin is currently $62 billion.

The first sentence is merely a subjective opinion, not necessarily false information.

Not sure how accurate this list is, but Andreas is mentioned as a potential upcoming guest.

I think they are about 1 - 1.5% above "spot". But I believe you can sell at the same "marked-up" price that is quoted for purchasing.

Safer options are hardware wallets, ledger or trezor.

We don't want this to occur yet. In the current climate these corporations wouls sell the bitcoin for fiat, driving the fiat price for bitcoin down. We want these corporations to hold the bitcoin and use it to pay employees and in their supply chains. Bitcoin will have to become much more accepted in the mainstream before the majority of employees and suppliers would choose to accept bitcoin over fiat.

I have a withdrawal awaiting approval for more than 48 hours now.

How do you have a sell order in place? Are you holding your bitcoin on an exchange?

Maybe there is some concern about withdrawing the Tether from bitfinex. You would be selling the bitcoin for the tether.
