Exactly. A £20k investment in creating a company wide system and 10 minutes of training each for  sales staff and CEX could appeal to this niche market before BTC hits mass. There are plenty of perks for them if they enter the market early enough

While I agree that there are *options*, none of them are exactly ideal. With bank transfers, fees are +this +that which can add up, especially if you're only converting a small sum of £ --&gt; BTC. In the states and a few other countries it's a lot easier to get BTC without going through a number of fee checkpoints. 
Personally, I used my bank to transfer to Transferwise and then into Euros so that I could buy some BTC through BitStamp. That cost me about £15 for my £50 transfer and was the cheapest option at the time. Things have improved, but not by much.

As a UK resident, this makes me extraordinarily happy! I see all the time that people are getting BTC ATM's and the like while the UK is stuck with bank transfers to international exchanges which are extortionate. Though still extortionate, hopefully this service will gain popularity in the UK BTC market and let it grow the way it should do.

I do believe that many smartphone and tablets have NFC built in, I have 3 NFC capable devices in my household thought I rarely use them. Plus, with the major contracts (visa etc) my thoughts are that it will only become more established and as a result, more common.

I could have a rectangular (stylised and embossed of course) metal place which would be mostly hollow but keep within it a metal NFC tab that pulls out as part of the case. My thinking is that the metal would not allow signals in or out unless opened.

OP is saying it's ridiculous, he didn't say he could do a better job with ASIC by any stretch. It's like everybody complaining about Mt. Gox when it goes down - people don't say they can do better, but they (rightfully so)  expect better.

I think the key point to this site would be a very fast, very easy, and very vibrent way to conduct reviews. The domain needs to be most probably a .com, but also something snappy which we can embed a lot of standardisation into. Think tripadvisor etc. 
Hopefully we can get a bunch more domain suggestions, or just keep rolling them out in a PM and I can go through them. If not, tomorrow I'll go ahead and buy one and being work on that, we can always transport the content over form one domain to another although changing the branding of an entire website can be troublesome. It's very early days but good work so far guys, keep it up!

Ahh great news, fellow student here, every penny counts ;) Keep an eye on the markets for now, get a few apps for Bitcoin, set alerts etc, it will give you a rough idea of quite how volatile the market can be. Important to know what you're investing in, especially if it's short term!

What a beautiful picture! 
About a year ago I talked to some Chinese manufacturers about minting my own coins (about 100 to start) with something similar in mind but ran into all sorts of problems. From a manufacturing point of view, how huge was the initial investment, and how did you do it?! The only thing stopping me was my lack of knowledge of the metal/minting business and initial finance. Very curious (and proud in a weird way) about how you managed to do it! 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:14:29

Of what kind/design?
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:36:21
Thanks for the feedback. The idea with the NFC is that it would be insulated within a solid metal casing that opens to reveal the chip which could be used to store a backup key for your wallet or something similar. The only trouble is engraving custom QR or a key on demand is that from manufacturing to the end user would take the best part of a month (CNC/Laser is in Australia, goes through me in the UK for P&amp;P etc then off to the customer who is often in the USA). Could all be done but at a price around the $200 mark + P&amp;P.. Not sure if people would be willing to pay that. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:47:19
I literally just put in £50 to test the market. Personally, I converted my GBP to EUR from my natwest account using TransferWise. From there, TransferWise sent the money on to Bitstamp. I'm now waiting for Bitstamp to receive the funds (3 days) and then I'm all good. This is the cheapest way to go because of the exchange rate fees etc with UK (and most other) bank. Best of luck, PM me if you need a hand!

In about a year's time, OP will realise he's a fag.
I get what you're saying OP, but you're going about it all the wrong way. People have different views on what a "good" present is but to be quite honest although some people may not be ultra excited, it's still a present. The guy who gave the BTC clearly thinks highly of Bitcoin and wanted to share the love, though just didn't think it through. Don't rage like a twat when "you're just a dick."

Had no plan to assign a value to them, simply for the novelty. There is something about a physical, heavy, solid chunk of crafted metal with the future on it that gets me. I'm truly surprised they aren't already in mass production. You know, give the out for making 1BTC for a pool or something..
