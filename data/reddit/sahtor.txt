Something like that would at least create a wallet app or faucet. I haven't coded these things partly because of heavy server requirements. (mostly because of laziness)
Taking code from official bitcoind project would be legal. You could implement them all.

Recompiles are faster if upgrade didn't touch particular source file. Are you sure you installed previous version directly from github source? Bitcoin Core distributes binaries for most people.
