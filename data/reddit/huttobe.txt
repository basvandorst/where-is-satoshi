I think we will not see like 75 percent dominance againd before the next bull run. However, the whole market needs a strong and stabilized btc before bull run. So i think when brc reaches above 45 percent during a upward period  it is healthy. But i dont agree we will see that october november kind of dominance again.

New block is mined by miners if miners consists of majority od the network. Right now unless more than 50 percent of miners agree on code change and accept a pos consensus added over pow, than it is impossible. What do you mean by nodes anyway? There are no pos consensus on btc network. Every miner is node practically. Id you are referring LN nodes. LN has no effect on bitcoin network. It is an off chain solution and can be integrated on every other blockchain coins. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 06:23:46
But if you are relying on btc rise than you can buy that amount of btc and hold. Is not it more reasonable ?
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:50:57
They dont need to rebuy bitcoin man. They are shorting with leverage. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:21:04
The only thing bcash is doing is creating bigger blocks than bitcoin. However, there is a reason why btc has 1 mb limit on blocks. It is for the sake of decentralization. So, everyone can contribute to the network by mining and realizing the transactions. However, imagine having 10 mb of blocks. You need more hashpower and bandwitch to keep your mining profitable. Also, bigger blocks does not necessarily solve the scalibility issue. You will have to have a datacenter to keep mining the network. There are some technologies being developed to solve scaling issue such as sharding, dag etc. Yes they have some problems too. Personally i have nothing to do with bcash actually. It just a hard fork of btc blockchain and a solution attempt. The real thing grinding my gears is that an idiot called roger ver and his delusional propagandas against the whole crypto. It is like a 9 year old boi trying to steal his bestfriends toy and crying all over the world. 
 THIS ISSUE HAS COME SO FAR THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MONKEY RATHER THAN DISCUSSING AND IMPROVING THE TECH.

It is about risk management. Bitcoin moves relatively slow compared to altcoins. You can lose or make money out of altcoins faster than bitcoin. I suggest creating a balanced portfolio. %30 in alts %40 in btc and %30 in fiat. So you can benefit from crashes.

if they could acquire bitmain with a court order or sth, yes maybe. But if they do that, probable that there will be hardfork. So, China versus rest of the world. Think the forked chain will be more trusted than the goverment controlled consensus. Just my 2 cents

Actually, the volatility will decrease over time imo with the rise of volume and therefore the relative gains will become less and less when the market matures. Think about coming from 3k to 12k meaning 4x. Now do the math from here. 10k to 40k psychologically and logically the latter sounds less probable. i m not saying its impossible. Just the global threshold of the possible market cap has a limit. Try not to banish me, i m also a bitcoin maximalist. However, i m holding a little sceptic stance against these 100 k 1 m predictions for short term. in the long run it is possible but the pace of the parabolic increase probably will slow down at certain levels in my opinion. Nonetheless, i think that when we see 100k, btc correction also will be less harsh with good volume.

If i dont recall otherwise, there was a theread covering this bank due to their anti bitcoin policy. They can ban you for further movements however they cant withold your balance. So, you still can withdraw your money even if it is against their policy. But they can prohibit your actions after you complete your transactions. I recommend search for more info on google.

They have to pay your money. Then they can close it. At least it is the case in Europe by law. No bank can put decease on your money unless you are reported with criminal behavior. However, they can ban you from being their customer if they do not want to deal with crypto movements on your account. So basically, you should be able to withdraw your money if it reaches youe account.

Heheh. Man it is not moved it has been sold via otc or darkpool. They are not selling on market. Just do a little research.

Fippening exist my friend. Maybe btc will evolve and adapt and remain its kingdom maybe a coin with better features and adoption take its throne. Nobody knows that. For example if lightning network is adopted and deemed as sucessfull some coins like nano will eventually disappear in my opinion. However there are projects aiming different things rather than being an alternative to bitcoin. We all were average joe once upon a time and not aware of other coins. Maybe from 10 years from now on average joe will recognize many coins not just bitcoin. We once had only nokia dominating. Than others follow.
