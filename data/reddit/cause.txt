Raspberry Pi
@_date: 2016-04-04 20:16:40
As far as I am aware, by downloading and running the software on your computer you would be contributing to the network as a node.
I myself actually have a Pi which I'm going to dedicate to doing this 24/7.

This is the kind of thing I would love to see on a screen located inside of a store or restaurant or company building. 
Publicizing Bitcoin by running a full node in this way would be a really cool thing for a business to do. Could be done cheaply too using something like a Raspberry Pi.

I feel very similar to how I think Andreas feels. I don't think either of us are very concerned with Venture Capitalists or entrepreneurs who take VC money. Surely it deserves recognition and opportunity to fair discussion, but it's not an area of Bitcoin that I consider to be of paramount importance.

Just bought something with a direct payment. Took less than a minute. Miner fee was 0.0002BTC
I will say though, new page listings are a bit slow to load and some listing don't always load a picture. Might just be my shitty internet though. Overall, a really painless experience.
On top of that, it seems that every few minutes, there's a dozen more listings that have appeared. Some of them are boxes of ammo and firearm related items. I even saw at least one car being sold.
This is gonna be interesting...

Sure, Core is intended to be run as a node but it can also be used as a wallet as well. To say that it can't be used as a wallet is inaccurate.

I just so happened to send out some coins a few minutes ago. Using Mycelium, I decided to choose "Normal" for miner fee this time, even though I usually choose "Priority".
Resulted in a fee of 0.0000518 BTC
Which resulted in an [Estimated Confirmation Time of 35 minutes.](
Pretty badass tool if you ask me. I could see this being extremely useful under certain circumstances.

Don't have any evidence, but I'd guess just solar charging mobile devices that still have coverage. Or utilizing a node with a [satellite connection](

Concerning time, I can do tomorrow but, if this becomes a regular thing, I'll just say now that Wednesday and Friday works best for me, any time. I'm pretty busy during every other time and day.
I'm not opposed to the coffee shop location but I'd be interested in hearing more about the pizzeria mentioned. If this becomes a regular thing, I think a pizzeria would be a better long-term setting.

This is arguably one of the biggest challenges that OpenBazaar faces.


I do think however that they are taking steps in the right direction.

~~May I ask why?~~
Actually, I as much as I would love to receive some free coins, I don't think you should give them away. I've read your recent posts and I don't think you should drop out just because you had a bad experience with Coinbase or some other exchange.
What I would suggest is that you take your coins off the exchange and move them into a desktop or hardware wallet. Popular desktop wallets are [Electrum]( and [Multibit HD](
If you haven't transferred them already, please read through the information of those pages. Also, if you have any questions, please feel free to PM me.
I think you'll be very happy that you kept your coins.
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:31:29
Only time will tell. It'll be interesting to see how this (and of course OpenBazaar) will eventually play out.

I'm thinking Friday. Next week on the 8th. Maybe around noon?
That way, we can give people some time to prepare, including the restaurant.
Out of the people whom I invited, those who've gotten back to me have said that Friday was best for them as well. I'm good for anytime but I'm guessing maybe sometime around noon or early afternoon would be best for most people.
I'll edit this post for updates and a general head count once we've had a bit more of a consensus.

That would be really awesome. Pizza goes great with just about anything, including Bitcoin. If this does become a regular thing, I think a pizzeria would be a perfect place for meet-ups. What's the place's name?

I just quickly scanned through the comments but generally, the news seems to have generated a much more positive response than the comments in a similar thread on r/futurology where I spent a good amount of my night clearing up misinformation. Nice to see.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:34:39
I actually addressed this topic in another thread just recently so I'm just going to copy and paste my previous two responses since I'm working off mobile and a bit lazy. 
"...the answer is that it exists as both [a currency and an asset], so we should address it as both.
As I said in response to someone else, Bitcoin as it is today, is a pseudo-anonymous asset which can be transfered from one person to another from anywhere in the world, instantly, without permission from a third-party, signed with proof of ownership and delivery within a minimum of minutes and a maximum of under an hour with nothing but an Internet connection and fees which normally translate to cents on the dollar.
Its value is determined by [these] attributes which the vast majority of people have agreed to be desirable. Because these attributes are desirable, people want to own this technology which possesses them and thus, as demand rises and falls accordingly, and since there is a fixed supply of this particular technology, the price for an individual unit of the asset is effected. Speculation on future price as well as the continuation of the technology possessing these desired attributes along with the belief that those attributes will continue to valued by the majority, naturally, plays a role in determining the price, just as it does with all assets and currencies.
The USD relies on the very same speculators and more importantly, the type of speculation occurring within the Bitcoin community. The difference is that the USD is currently much less volatile than Bitcoin and as such, most people tend not to think about such facts about currency, be it the USD or simply currency in general and, perhaps arguably so, wouldn't choose to use the word "speculators" to define the community of people who use the USD on a daily basis. Of course, back when the USD was relatively new, it's exchange price would fluctuate very similarly to the way Bitcoin's price tended to fluctuate back in the crazy days of late 2013/2014. It's something to be mindful of but it's certainly not irregular during the birth and early years of a currency or asset."
Claiming that Bitcoin is not a smart investment is debatable. Claiming that it's not an investment/asset in terms of classification is simply incorrect. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:20:04
I believe they stated that they will credit users with BTC balances with an equivalent amount of BCH, but I don't think they plan on supporting BCH trading until some time after the fork. However they might not support trading at all even later. As of right now, I don't think they've made a decision.

Not me. Then again, I usually set my priority to high. This morning's transaction fee translated to around 20 cents or so and took about 10 minutes for the first confirmation. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:03:33
Since the 27th. Kraken stated that they "plan to allow funding past 11am and will keep it open long enough for clients to make the final 6 confirmation deadline" on Aug 1, so you should receive your BCH if you bought early enough.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:24:07
Well you're feeling is incorrect. It has no where near 90% support of the entire community. I'd estimate that support is more likely to be somewhere around 40%, but support for something like this is pretty hard to gauge from the entire community so that number really isn't anything more than a guess. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:41:35
That's why I originally said "in the long run". Once all the coins that can ever be created *have* been created, it'll be accurate call Bitcoin deflationary, as the amount of coins available will only go down in number due to the reasons I mentioned. So for now, it's inflationary and the rate of inflation will continue to decrease over time until, once all 21 coins have been mined, it will become deflationary. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:32:52
Who knows. There's no definite answer that can be easily determined. If I had to make an educated guess though, I'd say a few factors in the price rise are: Japan declaring Bitcoin legal tender and large companies looking into adoption, SegWit locking in and thus, inviting hype and future speculation, BCH hard forking and the FUD diminishing as no hiccups were experienced and the big block enthusiasts now have what they want, and of course, just more demand in general as newcomers are diversifying their portfolios.
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:05:12
Bitcoin is first and foremost, non-inflationary in the long run, in that there's a fixed amount that can ever be created (approximately 21 million), in accordance to the current rules of the protocol, and deflationary in that, as time goes on, small amounts will be lost forever due to people loosing private keys and [burning coins]( In other words, after all the Bitcoins that can ever be created *have* been created, the total amount of accessible coins will only go down in number from then on, thus the deflationary aspect.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:29:33
Kraken seems to be taking a beating. Getting error codes every few minutes. Still waiting for them to credit me my BCH.
*EDIT: They just credited my account!
*EDIT  Finally was able to place a BCH order! I took about 15 mins and a lot of refreshing though.
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:11:13
An asset by definition is something that a majority of people consider to be valuable in some way. Because an asset has value, it is often compared against other assets and thus, a price for a certain amount of the asset in question can begin to be determined. There are many factors to how exactly a price per unit is established, but one of the larger factors is the scarcity of the asset. An asset with a fixed amount available and a large enough demand, will be one contributing factor to the valuation of the asset and thus, the price per unit. An asset that is deflationary in nature in that the amount available is decreasing over time, means that, as the asset becomes more scarce and the demand remains the same, the asset would likely become more valuable and thus, the price would rise as well, so long as the users of the asset still consider it to be of value to them.
Deflation isn't necessarily a bad thing, and in fact, in the case of Bitcoin, it's actually quite genius. The smallest amount of Bitcoin that can be transacted is one hundredth of a millionth of one Bitcoin. This amount is known as one Satoshi. There's a limited number of Bitcoin that can ever be created (about 21 million). Some of those Bitcoins that have already been created have been lost forever, and some of the Bitcoins which will be created in the near future will be lost as well. After all the Bitcoins that have ever been created *have* been created, the total number of lost Bitcoins will continue to increase as people loose private keys, burn coins, ect. This rate of deflation probably won't be significant, but it will no doubt contribute to the valuation and the price, along with the demand.
Right now, when people talk about Bitcoin's price, they usually refer to how much of a specific fiat currency one *whole* Bitcoin is worth. However, in the near future, I don't see this as being a viable method of talking about price. I suspect that it will be more common for the vast majority of "late entry" users to own less and less of one Bitcoin simply because they won't be able to afford a whole one. Sure there's still plenty of Bitcoin that hasn't been lost, but demand is one of the most important factors when it comes to valuation and price and in time, if demand rises high enough, the price will rise accordingly. The deflationary aspect will be one contributor to overall scarcity, but the thing which will have the most influential impact is demand. The transactions of the future will operate on a fractional basis. Probably not on the Satoshi level, but a fractional level nevertheless. In other words, because Bitcoin is deflationary in nature, and because it can be reduced to one hundredth of a millionth of one Bitcoin, it is essentially resistant against the negative aspects of a deflationary asset and will only become more valuable as scarcity rises, due mostly in part to demand and what we might call a "fixed" volume (the 21 million cap).

I don't think they're necessarily trying to market it as "better" than a Trezor, Ledger, or other secure hardware wallets. It's just another secure hardware wallet.
With a large OLED screen, aluminum back, and simple interface, the company decided to charge a higher price. Some people really value the design and interface and, as a result, are willing to pay more for it.

How much are you paying for rent and electricity? That's already about $11,000^* of hardware for a total of around 28TH/s. Sure, with a setup like that, you can make a decent amount of money in a month, but that's also a decent amount of total power consumption as well. What's your take home amount if I may ask?
Also, better make sure that little space your renting is properly ventilated.

OP's account was just suspended a few moments ago.
I wonder if it's because they have something against Bitcoin posts over there.
I was just looking at his comments and about to send him a PM and the suspension page came up.
Also, thread actually continued for quite a while. I can't link to it but you can find it over in the sub.
*Edit: Ya I guess they do have something against Bitcoin content. My comment here was auto removed because it linked to the sub over there. Apparently they've requested not to be linked from I think I remember it had something to do with too many people who owned a lot of coins going there and asking for financial advice a few years back.

Reddit is one of the worst sources of factual information, and in my opinion, the main reason most of the cryptocurrency userbase is so greatly misinformed. I myself am subscribed, but hardly ever bother browsing this and the related subreddits anymore. Even Bitcointalk.org has really taken a turn for the worst. What once was a thriving community of techincal discussion and innovation is now a place where fallacious reasoning not only goes unquestioned, but is actually supported. Furthermore, etiquette is shunned, and self-deprecating memes are coveted. Do yourself a favor and limit your exposure to these communities if your goal is to stay accurately informed on the technology.
I would recommend checking out [bitcoinmagazine.com]( They've been around since 2012 and may even be the first "professional" cryptocurrency news source created. They employ ethical editors and support excellent technical writers (staff, freelance, and guest) and from my personal experience with them, do a fine job of avoiding the use of overreaching and unsupported conclusions in their writings.
[The LTB (Let's Talk Bitcoin) Network]( has also been an excellent source of content which has done a great job at providing high-level, thought provoking discussions from various different individuals working close with or within the cryptocurrency space. I believe they've been releasing content since 2013 and originally had just two hosts, Andreas M. Antonopoulos and Adam B. Levine, but have continued to add more hosts over time. The LTB Network also includes other podcast content besides the original Let's Talk Bitcoin series which focus on a vast array of crypto-related things.
The Bitcoin Core development team typically holds weekly IRC meetings in which anyone may attend and which [log summaries are made publicly available for later viewing]( I encourage everyone to either attend themselves or to view the log summaries at a later period.
There are other news outlets such as [Cointelegraph]( and [CoinDesk]( which seem to be fairly popular and sometimes put out great content, as well as plenty others that I'm sure are also excellent sources of information. But I'm just writing this on my phone, off the top of my head, so I'm going to stop here. Regardless of wherever you get your news from, even if from a highly trusted outlet with a proven track record, I encourage you to always check any significant claims made by verifying with another, better yet multiple, trusted sources if you care about being accurately informed.

Even if this is just joke, that kind of attitude is arguably the biggest existential threat to Bitcoin today, specifically how much of the community seems to not understand or even care about the importance of decentralization and one of the problems Bitcoin was designed to solve; namely, necessarily having to incorporate a centralized party at some level in order to function properly.

In order for it to work and be reliable, people need to know exactly what it is (what it does) and exactly how it works (how it does it). Not all the people who use it of course, but anyone who makes suggestions as to how the protocol ought to function should first understand how it already functions, and what exactly it would take to make those desired changes, and ideally, be willing to provide evidence with both mathematical proofs and field tests.
