Then why not short it from 13k to 10k, with some percentage of holdings?
Unless expect = fifty fifty... ��

The person who paid 10000, didn't make any (fiat) money. But has a bitcoin instead, which is priceless. 
One could also say that only the last person won, as he/she holds bitcoin, all others have worthless dollars :)

It's just a simple fork:
1) release version that understand new millisatoshis but doesn't make blocks with them
2) wait for majority to upgrade
3) enable making blocks with millisatoshis
4) everyone is force to upgrade now. Except for those who don't, who then create Indivisible Bitcoin Classic (IBC)
5) IBC then buys [bitcoin.com]( and declares that Bitcoin is no longer true to Satoshi vision as Satoshi is atomic and indivisible. Making satoshi divisible is an abomination and such attempt should burn in eternal flames.
6) Miners then mine both BTC and IBC. And IBC is obviously better, less bits per transaction value means smaller blocks, so less chance to loose the race. Not as good as mining empty blocks but still
7) A new idea is born. Why have fraction of bitcoin to begin with? Less bits per transaction is obviously better. A new Bitcoin Max (BMX) fork is made. 
8) ...

Those are not a problem in hybrid PoW/PoS, if a if PoW is responsible for generating blocks, where longest (most-diffcult) chain wins.

Just because bitcoin is oldest doesn’t mean it’s protocol is best possible protocol.
Also decentralization is not pure node or hashrate numbers. Bitcoin mining is concentrated, and only miners have power to change protocol, not all nodes.


The fact that there is a bcash etc is not a feature its a bug. Ideally Segwit should’ve been adopted or rejected by entire community. There is no value is side forks. 
We don’t fork off our government everytime a president we don’t like gets elected.
Miners can also be a and actors. Like mining empty blocks so they propagate faster, how does pure PoW solve that?


It’s not what I’m suggesting. PoW miners do good job enforcing rules. But giving the same group of people right to both create the rules and enforce them usually doesn’t end well. 
If you introduce PoS in addition to PoW you increase the diversity and number of actors.
Billionaires can buy miners or coins all alike, I’m not aware of any solution to that, but bitcoin doesn’t solve it either.

Decred. (Bitcoin protocol with addition of PoS on top of PoW)
Better decentralization + fork resistance. Similar security. Similar scalability.
Fork resistance is imho the most important feature, since it allows consensus protocol changes without splitting chain into forks and ending up making a mess and dividing community. 
Uses both PoW+PoS (PoW mines blocks, PoS approves them) allows for on chain binding consensus voting and automated feature on/off. Hostile forks are blocked by PoS.
Addition of PoS does not regress scalability. PoS uses fixed number of votes per block with fault tolerance (3 out of 5 votes needed). PoS supports pooling/ delegating, to further improve reliability.
PoS is incentivized by value of the currency. Use of time lock of funds for voting, disincentives making harmful decisions, especially on a large scale required to pass a harmful change. (You can’t poop on the chain and then hope to dump before the price drops)
That’s what bitcoin should’ve done from beginning. Now good luck making miners adopting a consensus change that reduces their own power.

\&gt; the idea that there would be consensus in the market that shitcoin A  would be better (worth more, sustained) than bitcoin but that there  would not be consensus in bitcoin to steal shitcoin A's advantage is  illogical
This argument is only valid under the assumption, that whoever participates in the consensus has the incentive aligned with the feature to be adopted/copied/stolen.  
If feature X is good for bitcoin community but not the miners, why would miners adopt it?  
Say, increase a block size. Requires miners to buy better network connection, and reduces the transaction fees. Unlikely that it will be adopted, even if was good for the project (no idea if it is).
Or a feature that reduces the miners voting power.

Not disagreeing if talking about pure PoS. 
Care to elaborate?
