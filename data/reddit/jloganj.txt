I'm sure I wasn't the only one, but I was emailing Max about Bitcoin very early on, well before he ever talked about it. Glad he grabbed it and ran

I also placed an order for ten Terraminers. The first thing I'll say about them, is I was very impressed by the physical hardware quality (though I haven't really gotten to peek inside yet, except throught the front screens w/ a flashlight)
That said, I have been contacting Cointerra for a week to get some tech support and/or RMA service and they have been totally unresponsive. I have called and emailed multiple times, with constructive feedback and detailed reports of our issues. Still no response.
Of the ten units, one is totally unresponsive, one has really low fan speeds and the user interface has a red alert of some kind on the fan speed readout, three others have underperforming cooling systems. As someone who has built many water-cooled computers, my best guess is that the waterblocks are poorly seated on the chips; since opening the rigs would violate the warranty, I have no way to troubleshoot.
I want to like this company and buy more of their hardware, but where is the warranty service??? I wouldn't mind at all that they dropped their warranty service from 90 days to 30 days if they would just answer the phone and/or email me a shipping label!

Competitors congratulating each other on success in the open market. Now, this is capitalism!

I, too, have contacted Cointerra multiple times for support and they just don't respond. Over a week since my first contact attempt, nothing yet. Time's ticking on the warranty period and the miners' profitability, I hope they honor their sales agreement before people less reasonable than me do something like initiate a lawsuit.

I see this as similar to locally hosted PBX systems. Sure, you can go with a cloud provider of VOIP services, but some people will always prefer to have direct control over their comms. There will definitely be a strong niche for this sort of system. +1
