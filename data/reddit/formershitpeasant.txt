People making plays on BTC options will sometimes need to buy BTC to hedge their position.

Having an etf and derivatives market for BTC will only mean more people trading in it and raising it's value. It conveys literally no control over any nebulous notions of freedom surrounding the coin. It is and will always exist as a vehicle to hold value, and it will remain the same decentralized currency it always has been regardless of any virtual trading floors built to trade it on.

The product is different. Online retail was a whole new market. There is significant differentiation. Between BTC exchanges, not so much differentiation.

It's not needed, but it will add some legitimacy and long term staying power cryptos and raise their value for no downside.

If you want to talk in strict terms, then yeah, but when I think of retailers, I think of their product as being the merchandise as well as the interface and methods of sale and delivery. Ordering from amazon is an entirely different experience from going to Walmart and standing in line for 15 minutes behind people of Walmart. BTC exchanges are all online platforms that provide a similar experience. There is a lot more differentiation between Amazon and Walmart than there is between different exchanges, which means there is a bigger hurdle for new market entrants who have limited ways to innovate on such a simple concept.
