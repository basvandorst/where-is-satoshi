are you referring to the DAO attack on the Ethereum chain?  That had nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-30 03:21:13
Thanks for replying with a factual point to educate me instead of more holier-than-thou dickery.
@_date: 2016-08-30 03:21:46
no, by definition the TCP/IP implementation is just one layer of a network stack.  That's what the link I posted demonstrates.
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:36:04
But TCP/IP is "one size fits all" for the transport layer: 
There are obviously many other alternatives for the transport layer, but parent post's point remains valid about TCP/IP.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:20:13
Then why are these transactions also splitting up UTXO as well?  Both kinds are included.  I think you just wanted to be snarky about the BTC chain.

lol I have, more than a second look. Right now it’s almost entirely content free on the front page, just videos of interviews where he bloviates, a few pictures of police to raise the vittles, and a bonus appearance of Hillary fainting.  Quality discussion there.
edit: lmao, there is just a GIF of pepe praising Trump, tagged 'god-emperor'

I like that the deflection of (6) was to pretend not to have heard of Trump, a name I am sure most Venezuelans are at least vaguely familiar with due to his saber rattling about a possible orchestrated coup.

Are you aware of how long Denmark has existed? “Limp along for a while”?

Can you quote actual prices for those lines? US prices.  Like a 5Gbps commit.
It is an argument for centralization if you advocate for a change to the system that makes participation viable for a smaller and smaller subset of the population.  That ends in centralization of power with those that already have means.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:26:37
I totally forgot about very pricey 10/40/100Gbit lines in datacenters.
Oh no wait, that is completely beyond the skillset/financial means of more than a tiny fraction of the population.  You are the one who is wrong, and you are arguing for centralization.

Real world network speeds have grown nowhere nearly as fast as storage speeds, that is a fact that most people cannot seem to grasp when arguing for big blocks.

I’m genuinely curious which resource(s) prevent you from running a Core node.  Could be something fixable.
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:22:51
They got rid of the validator nodes? Can you provide a source? The current codebase still has central validator nodes, so I think you are a liar.

Personal benefit: reduces outside trust, increases privacy (if you point your wallet to use your own node).

How does switching data on the ASICs cause them stress? Do they really pull all the power and do a full reset on each new block? Seems like a design issue.
