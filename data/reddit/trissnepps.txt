Is any of this investable or is it just a means of allowing BTC to increase its scale by incorpoating off-block transactions securely thus ensuring BTC remains in positive valuation and industry dominance?

Can someone here recomen me one of those alt-coins finna blow up or list me the email of Satoshi so I can email him direct to see what the fuck is going on down there?

Any chance XRP holders will become the second wave of cryptobillionaires? Ive got BTC mostly but it is rather expensive compared to XRP. Maybe 9 years from now those 40 cent ripples will be worth 10k a pop and btc will be worth hundreds of thousands... or maybe Libra will crush everything and put the power back into the hands of the oligarchs..
I love Bitcoin!

I enjoyed this. Ross dude was tripping at the end there.. but itnis bs how the government crushed him for doing what many other corporations do daily. Fuck the government man. Really. I love the USA but our government has become too bloated and too intrusive. NSA was used to get into the back end of silkroads server - illegal. They don't care though. So fuck them out loud. I'll always speak my mind. Fuck the CCP too.

Someone should make a new FB mixed with BTC and we should all become friends in the system and propagate in all directions outwards with total transparity to revolutionize and secure our future freedoms.

Okay guys- lots of great explanations for the neophytes like me but can you now throw soome shade on why these occurences are not driving up the price of our boy?
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:18:44
Yea. My brother back in the states has a big house, nice job, wife and two boys. He is a bit over 40. I live on an island in Thailand in a one bed room house right on the beach. I fuck models and go to parties regularly that most people never experience once in their lives. I stay fit and sexy, make more money than I ever did back home, and find so much joy and contentment with my current life that I have to regularly pinch myself to make sure it is all real.
My brother did what everyone else did. I did what I wanted to. He has more assets, I have more happiness. It is never too late to toss off the yolk. You need not wait. I left years ago - I would never go back. 
Good luck to you for the rest of your life. It's a big world out there you know - go experience some of it!
Much love.
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:28:01
Well done sir! Much felicity for your ascendancy! Here here!
Perhaps now you can explain in perspicuity that which you know and what I have asked to learn?
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:38:57
Bravo. I enjoyed reading your post. I wonder at your lack of imagination though friend. If everything that we have yet seen has been proved possible, why too not a REAL decentralized currency?
We need the masses. BTC will bring the masses. We will, and do, have the opportunity to start a people led, individual based, cryptocurrency exactly like BTC down to a T.. Same protocols, same developers, same community - and rehash BTC 2.0.
We REALLY COULD redistribute wealth, for the very first time in history. By having a global apparatus to announce the coming of BTC 2.0 and some sort of blockchain framework set up to regulate the amount individuals could purchase.
That seems to me the closest to paradise we can get. And why should we not get there? The alternative is allowing BTC to bring the masses and then have us all slaves to the oligarchs at the top, same as we are now basically just by other means.
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:31:58
Thank you friend. Truly. This is what I too think but then, why not go one link farther?
Once the whales drive adoption and hundreds of millions of people realize, like we have, that most BTC is and always will be within the control of a very few then why would we not just say "fuck you," to those few and simply relaunch BTC with global awareness and regulated inititial purchasing options?
We can do everything BTC promises to do but we can't remove the oligarchs? Nah. Fuck that. Drive adoption sure but then it is VERY CLEAR that BTC IS NOT THE FUTURE
 
BTC IS SIMPLY THE NOW.
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:26:31
Um, yea. Use your brain.. BTC can buy everything.
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:47:22
A hundred up votes to you sir. This is, I feel, the most correct outlook currently. I do think that a BTC 2.0 is a real possibility for the reasons outlined above. Until then, I see BTC as the safest bet. It truly is, excepting the oligarchs, almost perfect. It is certainly revolutionary. Thank you for your time and wisdom. I wil continue to use BTC as an investment vehicle and storage of wealth for now.
Thanks again for your response.
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:12:57
No, not truly. It started out though backed by gold/silver. Only after the worlds nations had it stockpiled as their reserve currencies and the USA have global dominance did they then remove any precious metal backing from the dollar so that now it is the same as BTC in that is only has value bc people believe it does.
However, what is your reasoning to suggest BTC could ever reach that point given the digital oligarchy that currently exist and the lack of official pushers, like say, the strongest nation in Human history?
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:26:05
The way I see it, you have been efficacious in proving yourself to be just another person deserving of only levity. You will not be so successful in your actions as a trammel however. Good day.
@_date: 2019-09-15 03:55:55
It was clearly political and your panegyric epistle in the defense of Socialism is easily swept aside by anyone with more than a rudimentary knowledge of History. 
Fuck your direction and it's inherent assumption that I am somehow affiliated with one or the other in perpetuity. I use logic and deduction to reach my conclusions friend so you can shove your perceptions right back up your perfidious asshole.
Capitalism, far from perfect, has fared better than any other economic system in the History of Mankind ! A statement so complete with supportable evidence as to only be challenged by an assinine fool such as yourself. 
Why you make the presumption that a cursory acceptance of Capitalism ties me inviolably to it's accepted author is also an avowal of your shallowness of thought and logic. An imbecile even.
Bitcoin is undermining the previous century's economic monopoly from Bretton Wood's meeting. You should read up on the subject.
You then end your ridiculous and largely unintelligble rant by using some unknown invective and petty insults. As if I would deign to waste my time watching TV or the drivel that spews forth from it. Lol. 
Your imputations against me are false and your approbation for Socialism is an eclaircissement to your idiocracy.
Socialism is for disease minded cunts who want to take from other people without themselves giving shit. Socialism has caused the deaths of over 100 million people. Socialism is EVIL. If you still support Socialism after all it has done then you are either evil or willingly ignorant and to both types of people I say simply FUCK YOU.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:37:06
It is new and already concentrated in the hands of a VERY few, mostly anonymous people, with unknown plans, and no (from my point of view) way to ever achieve any real sort of coin distribution.
I have put over $20000 into BTC ok? I have real skin in the game and these are serious problems which I believe must have already been provided but have so far just been unable to find.
Find me here answers!!!
@_date: 2019-09-02 03:11:53
Well.. Honestly most of Thailand has been over run. The best places are Koh Phangan, Koh Tao, and a few islands in the Andaman Sea like Koh Hong, Koh Poda, Koh Phi Phi, ect.

Many thanks friend. I will review what you have presented with solicitude. In any case I do believe BTC will remain ascendant for the short to mid term at least. Thanks again for your reply.

Another useless comment deserving censure. How about some fucking eclaircissements??? Jesus.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:01:53
Thank you but respectfully no one is answering my questions - BTC could be another Apollo 13. It may never make it bc of these issues unless I am missing something..
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:23:10
Better than an ignorant profligate i'll wager. Without satisfactory answers to my questions that is all investing in BTC will ever be, profligacy. I have already invested $20000, sir, which I believe grants me just cause to seek out an alleviation to my inquietude.
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:57:34
Most pertinent and honest answer I have recieved all day. 
Seems like it is just a systemic weakness that cannot be undone without a completely new and regulated relaunch that will never be possible without another digital asset being hashed globally from the start.. Seems likely to happen actually. 
When more and more people get on the digi currency train and learn about BTC being in the control of only a few digital oligarchs why would they not just say "fuck you," and start a brand new BTC with the same fundamentals and principles and decentralization running on a lightening network?
They could then regulate the buying period MUCH BETTER than for BTC to ensure that, at least at the beginning, the wealth does not simply materialize predominately at one end. Otherwise what's the fucking point?
If and when that happens, BTC will be worth shit.
So I really hope some people here have good reasons why this should not be a MAJOR concern other than their own emotional opinions. I say again, $20000+ invested here. I'm not a fucking troll.

That's because everyone learns about the Holocaust in school but noone learns about the Gular Archipelago or the Cultural Revolution. Leftist ideaologies in the education system prefer to skip over their ideaologies previous catastrophes.
How else would a significant amount of 'educated' people actually support Socialism today? Because they put the word democratic in front of it? It's a disgusting reminder how stupid Human beings can be.

It is much too volatile and so far has a community of less than 40 million out of over 7.4 billion.
How can there be massive adoption, required to drive the price where we all want to see it go, when so much is controlled by so few?

@_date: 2019-09-01 02:44:27
I retract my earlier thank you. You, sir, have done nothing for the sake of my argument that MOST BTC IS CONTROLLED BY SEVERE FEW WITH NO FORESEEABLE WAY OF EVER MOVING THE BELL CURVE TO A MORE DISPERSED MODEL!
Truly is it so hard to comprehend? From one oligarchy to the next huh? We don't know who the whales are for the most part or what they are, or plan, to do with their extreme wealth that would only intensify as BTC price increases.
What central banks or nation states will ever seriously invest in a currency that is controlled by a small group of shadowy individuals with unknown intentions?
How will we ever be able to gain more share in the total market?
How will BTC ever escape the volatility inherent in a system built as it currently is - with majority wealth stacked in the hands of a few individuals? How!?!
I KNOW DIGITAL MONEY IS THE FUTURE BUT UNLESS THERE ARE SUITABLE ANSWERS TO THESE ISSUES BTC WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE "IT"
I am searching for specific explanations.

Because he tells me how much he wished he waited and went off and did like me every conversation we have perhaps? I live in paradise, he lives in the rat race with the rest of you.
My existences will be even more profound when I do settle with a woman (after having been with well over 100) that I wont have to think.. oh man, what if I did this or had one like her.. Ive had them all. From whales (at 15) to L'Oreal models from France (last month). Ill be happy and content in my choice and have 3-5 kids and continue to live on a small island where my days are spent wkth friends and families, not commutes and office cubicles.
You're right tho - maybe he, and you, are happier. I sure hope so.

I'm holding for the most part. However if the situation I pose is without rectification then it seems dumb to keep paying almost 10000 dollars for one digital token whose value can be determined substantially by a few clicks of someone elses mouse.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:32:36
My deportment, sir, is in no need of any edification. I find the reply which solicited mine to be the one deserving of censure as it adds no merit and is ambiguous to boot.
I mispoke. Debate is wrong. I am seeking answers. I have not been able to find them thus so here I am, in the community dedicated to its cause, asking for those answers.
Are you able to provide any elucidations? I am looking for an erudite not a pedantic, as previously stated
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:14:53
Well fucking speak on it then Doolittle. I'm here to debate for answers not fuck around with a fake pedantic.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:22:42
Only because you mistake transparency for something else. Or you live according to the propriety dictated to you by others. 
 
Most people languish in the pernicious and insipid comformity that makes up modern life.
Cringe is right.
@_date: 2019-09-15 04:25:05
The only thing you nailed was proving yourself only deserving of levity. It's called having a vocabulary friend. It's developed by reading which is something I doubt you spend much time doing. Instead you simply profilgate your time around here apparently by trying to convince others to become proslytic sheeple like yourself.
Socialism will never take place in the USA without a Civil War being lost by my side... You know, the individual liberty loving 2nd Amendment supporters. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:19:06
Your insipid and acrimonious invectives make me chuckle. Like watching a toddler languish at tying shoelaces.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:06:39
From a friend:
Yep, the last paragraph is exactly what I was thinking about. Gold is much more distributed around the world and it's been used for hundreds of years as a storage of value, who knows how many decades it will take central banks to accept any crypto as a reserve, if it ever happens. 
Yes, if I was a Bitcoin whale I would not sell my portion of BTC in the nearest future either, but think about the whole situation from the position of the head of the central bank of any country: would you invest a large portion of the wealth of your country into an asset that is controlled only by a few people? Surely, thousands of early adopters have already sold or lost their BTC, but what is the chance that the creator(s) of Bitcoin were stupid enough to lose millions of Bitcoin they initially created? None, I suppose. And nobody knows who they are and what their plan is. This fact might stop the whole thing from further global adoption.
He makes good points here and I am not sure the proper refuatation beyond time which does not bode well for global acquistion anytime soon. Over time, slowly, whales will spend coins but not enough..
 Without BTC collapsing and becoming almost worthless (causing whales to sell off) how will the coins ever be distriubted in a more central bell-curve gradient??? - even if it did collapse and current whales sold the cycle would most likely simply repeat itself.. if a new BTC were launched rich people would just buy the majority of coins at drop and once again, whales control the market.
What is the way forward here bitcoiners? Is THIS going to be the Achilles Heel?
@_date: 2019-09-20 10:50:59
Those things all seem likely if not possible, brah. Real HODL's know when its time to drop btc like a hot potato and start reeling in some libras brah or you know, like, w.e. the next fad turns out to be my dude
Hell, bitches was buying pet rocks in the 70's making some guy millions. Give me millions. Btc to the moooooooo��. Stay looking for the next best thing tho�� IWANTTHATGREENGRASS! Till she roll in tho, it's all bitcoin baybee ����������.. brah

@_date: 2019-09-01 13:19:17
I suppose if enough individuals become involved there would never be cause to have government or central bank usage. Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:09:28
So, so far, my answer is that I am right and that thw whale situation will prevent BTC from ever being taken up by any excepting individuals. BTC is is obsolete for use a global currency.
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:25:42
Thanks for the time and energy spent in your reply. It is certainly deserving of some approbation. If anything I feel after today that BTC will be tutelary to the exordium of the rise of digital currencies. I also find it mostly true what you state regarding a redistribution quickly resulting in the same result as what currently stands. For now I am happy to keep BTC as a store of value. Thanks again for the reply.
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:29:54
Ah, a true erudite to the subject. You have eased my inquietude and restablished my ardour. I thank you much, truly. Let us hope the moves are up from here then a? Thank you once again for your time and perspicuity.
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:50:45
Boom! Another captious pedantic in the house! So far the gambling guy seems the most helpful since he is the most honest. The rest of you are just too acrimonious or timorous to say you don't know. 
Why else would you even post to a question thread if it was not directly pertinent to the answer? Proselytic sheeple.
@_date: 2019-09-01 02:07:39
Well then, my compatriot, might we both then combine our exhortations? I have real bread in the basket here so I am hardly trying to play the role of marplot.
How can we increase viewership to our questions, since, they seem so paramount to deciding if BTC will ever in fact make it beyond a fringe element?
I am with you on the need to answers here but I am a Reddit neophyte. I have the time and energy for the struggle tho - my current investment demands it.
Thanks for sharing.
