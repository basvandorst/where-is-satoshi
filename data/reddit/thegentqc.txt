Hi Kyle,
I have been a customer on Cavirtex for a while now and would like to give some feedback.
About 1 month ago, I submitted a ticket detailing how your exchange could only be used to cash in / cash out because of the hi trading fees (1.5%). The way I see it, you we're forcing customers to go elsewhere with the lower fees, better interface... I still wonder since seeing the communication email this week if my email actually made a difference.
I have a few suggestions for you as I'm a happy customer so far. Customer service did respond quickly and never had any issues doing transactions. 
I have a few suggestions:
1. Order book needs work, something more visual, less boring. With graphs.
2. First page should have prices / volume in "real-time". Charts should be done in house.
3. Add chat feature: People will stick around, might actually make a nice place to talk about crypto. Incorporate technical support in the chat.
4. Wave the inactive fee. What happens if you have 0.001 BTC, the fee value will be more than the wallet itself?
5. Display: How many people are online now? this would give a "crowd" feel to the site.

Since you're in the united states, you have a lot of options available. Since you want to integrate these 3 currencys in your website (bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin) your best option is via Snapcard:
 They offer next day deposits with a maximum of 1% fee. 
From what i've seen and tested, bitpay is the easiest. Most payment processors (Gocoin, bitpay, etc..) will have integration partners to guide and assist you.

James teaches to import your private keys using Blockchain.info in another video. I wouldn't use that method with all the heat that blockchain.info is having lately.
Paper wallets + Bip38 is definitely the way to go. Glad I could help :)

The best way i've learned about crypto is watching James Dangelo.
If you would like to generate paper wallets (Bip 38) have a look at this video:
It's important to test the generated address by trying to decrypt it with your passphrase before sending funds.

using this volatility to gain from switching ltc/btc ratio. :P
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:20:39
If you don't mind the loss, why not point to p2p? At least it's beneficial for the overall network and it's balancing things out.
@_date: 2014-09-03 21:35:14
I just took a look at my history chart. On september 1st last year, bitcoin was 119 and litecoin 2.37

@_date: 2014-12-15 23:44:45
I will let you know what I think of them when everyone has been refunded :P
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:42:56
Have you tried looking at James Deangelo videos?
These 2 videos will answer all your questions:
Paper wallets, addresses:
How private keys work:

vanity reference to using the github app to generate a custom address. example, your name is roy, and you would like your address to start with 1roy ... vanity allows you to generate that.
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:48:03
I would think that the richest addresses are mostly exchanges. Meaning it grows over time?
@_date: 2014-12-20 23:31:05
why would it matter?
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:09:04

a second healthy blockchain is important. The value is in the blockchain...

Almost all wallet's apply the 0.001 transaction fee.
However, when using Bitcoin QT (and others) you can go to settings (advanced). This will let you specify the fee you would like to pay. Beware, no transaction fee can take up to 24hrs to confirm. This means the transaction has happened, but has not been included in the ledger yet (0 confirmations).
@_date: 2014-12-21 02:02:05
Even if you didn't accept bitcoin, given your background in mining, people would assume these are used mining gpu's.
coincadence gave great feedback.

I think the next big step is a working paypal/btc wallet. I'm also going out on guess and the next headline will be:
"Microsoft purchased Bitpay"
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:13:57
Thanks, I will check these out... Is there any others? I would like feedback from people who have tried these ATM's or other bitcoin related payment systems.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:35:47
i'm also curious about the "bandwith" issue. How much bandwith are you streaming in a month (approx)
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:22:37
Evertime you will open up bitcoin core, it will sync the blockchain. Once you're up do date, you only update what you have missed.
It's good to have a computer with QT running as this helps the overall network.
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:51:48
Anyone know of any other products? I'm interested even if it's in development.

Comfirmation times can take up to one hour. It's a bit random.
You can view an average here:

Bitcoin has evolved to a point where it should mostly be mined by businesses, and that's ok.
If you read up on sathoshi, he was expecting this...
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:12:17
This is a valid solution, i was hoping for something that you don't pay per month. I think I will find more info and give this a try. Thanks

I'm having similar issues with my wife's laptop and finally fixed it. The reason for this is either driver corruption (reinstall wifi drivers) or when windows update pushes the wrong Intel wifi drivers.
Im curious if you have tried changing your wireless channel by any chance? You can use an app like Wifi analyser and try to get a channel that is  not currently being used by others around you.
I see that you have tried good troubleshooting steps so just handing out some ideas...

I think that you could call this year's December prices over the top. I remember video cards selling 150% over retail because of demand.
This eventually leads to Asic machines mostly purchased by businesses.

I have been in the crypto world for a while and there's one thing I don't understand yet. How can he be eligible to start other business? 
1. He would need money to do so, who would be willing to loan him money?
2. His name has been affected by all this, who would want to do business with him?

No fundamentals have change, Why sell?
Investing comes with the lows...

they could integrate the windows search to be able to search the blockchain for addresses, i guess that would be bing
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:15:21
Is there other options?
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:23:18
Good job on learning this.

When using the blockchain as identity is this how it works?:
You submit a public address that you own, when you would like to identify you sign a message from the address?
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:47:42
Thank you :)

One important question: Do they require the btc to be converted to fiat via direct deposit in their bank accounts or will they will be using the BTC to purchase goods?
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:38:28
this means you need to open an RBC USA bank account in order to use circle. It's not really a solutions.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:53:08
I personally think it's a publicity stunt...
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:41:35
12 hours is a bit long. Send email to support with tx number and see what's up. Probably nothing to worry about...
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:35:21
No if it's done on an offline machine (you can use tails in offline mode to create your cold storage address and test them).
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:23:07
You can withdrawn your coins. Have you tried contacting support like suggested on website/email?
I did what they asked and coins arrived 20 minutes later.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:52:41
I am wondering if I lost all those coins.
Selling and withdrawing fiat takes how long? Direct Deposit?
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:33:02
You need to contact support and they will unlock withdrawals.
I have received mine with no problems...
