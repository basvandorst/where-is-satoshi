I mean they already forked off. Neither of us consider that chain the bitcoin chain, so it seems like that approach isn’t going to work.

Mining centralization is also caused by specialization of hardware. If bitmain is the only game in town, it's going to be hard for individuals to take mining share.
There are proposed mitigations to this like asic resistant proof of work, proof of capacity, and proof of stake. But none have really borne out.

I agree that the block size should increase, but I don't think miners should be deciding it dynamically.
There needs to be some incentive to keep the blocksize in check in the event of miner centralization.

If they increase the block size such that you can't run a full node, they can make Bitcoin into whatever they want.

It's not the case. Bitcoin users would have to change their nodes to accept those blocks.
If I get 75% of the miners to build on blocks with an increased block reward, that doesn't make those blocks bitcoin. Users wouldn't accept those blocks, it would be a hardfork altcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-12 06:59:41
In order for that to be false, the unmodified bitcoin core client would have to accept blocks bigger than 1mb (spoiler: it doesn't).
I agree that the economic majority decides what bitcoin is. If people aren't willing to pay for blocks on the BU chain or call it bitcoin, then it's not bitcoin.
Probably the reason BU miners run with EB=1 is because few people would pay for BU coin.

Ok, so now the leaker deletes the watermark from the video, and keeps it. Over the years they accumulate private keys from video to video, until they fake their death and take all the bitcoins.

That's not the argument I'm making. As a miner, Jihan can control what goes in his blocks (Some of them are empty FYI). If he hates segwit he doesn't have to include the transactions in his blocks. He can't control other miners obviously.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:44:13
I mean he can ignore the segwit transactions in the mempool and not include them in his blocks.

If he doesn't want to give segwit a discount he can ignore segwit transactions

Not necessarily, the added emissions would probably kill lots of people.

another way to look at it: Miners are hodling and only have been selling what they need to sell to keep running, (since the hashrate is the same) so the market's inflation wasn't actually 8-&gt;4% and was actually &lt;4-&gt;&lt;4%.
So, nothing will happen until bitcoin becomes more valuable (i.e. lightning).
@_date: 2016-07-15 22:17:07
There are many miners with different motivations, which muddles up all these generalizations.
That said, going and building a datacenter to mine bitcoin is a huge speculative action. If they wanted to reduce the risk of their investment, they would be selling everything immediately.
However, I think the kinds of people who are willing to go to such great lengths to build out mining infrastructure and design asics really believe in bitcoin long term. (plus the actual investment they're making is all VC fiat, they'll just print more anyways)
