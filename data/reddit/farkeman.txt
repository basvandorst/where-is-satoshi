You should research what a fork is then, because fork has every right to the name. It would be really bad for decentralization argument if we could only have 1 fork with 1 client with 1 name.

I think one overlooked feature of crypto is freedom of travel.  
I travel quite a bit and it's really painful to deal with money. Usually you have to carry cash which is ok for small amounts. Then you need to use an ATM which are often riddled with insecurities and hacks, to add to that the bank often charges hefty fees, usually 1-3% + static amount - it's not much but it adds up quickly.   
If something happens to your debit card you're pretty much stuck, that's why you probably want to carry several, together with bank loggin tools like authenticators etc. - all this overhead adds up and introduces a lot of points of failure.  
I got into crypto mostly as an investment but now I'm mostly interested in future usage as a payment system. I'd be fine with bitcoin finding a price and staying on it if it has global adoption and actually works :)

You migt be right, but it's pretty hard to follow the vision when for the longest time now the project fails to fulfill it's main purpose and vision - decentralized value exchange.

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:34:15
You keep missing the whole point of cryptocurrency being __decentralized__.
There no advertisements or tactics or whatever. Isn't it organic for followers of a project to want it succeed? You act as if modern BTC community cares about Nakamotos vision when r/bitcoin is 90% moon and hodl memes - there's no discussion about technology itself here.
The truth is, this is what Nakamoto himself was preaching and pushing bitcoins design towards this point - encourage greed, because decentralized projects benefit from it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:04:59
Personally I agree with you, I very much prefer KISS design without any unnecessary complexities.  
That being said I still understand the side-chain philosophy and think it could work, though the damage this conservatism and no-action is doing to the network is indisputable, the only argument against that is that bitcoin network is strong enough to soldier through it.

The thing is micro-payments almost don't exist on the network because of the congestion, so LN solves a non-existing problem. In other words LN introduces _new_ possibility of micro-payments but doesn't address the current congestion.


This is an illusion of choice; if bitcoin only has 1 solution then the only choice you have is to fork the whole bitcoin and implement your own solution. That's not a realistic choice, especially when forks are the devil itself in the current bitcoin climate, when for a healthy ecosystem forks should be encouraged.

I think it's really hard to find an analogy for crypto. It's free software but also it's money driven - it basically is all about money. 


They do though, a well maintained distro is worth billions of dollars. i.e. Red Hat earned 1.3$ billion last year. It's a huge market.
A lot of technology is just that - technology. Linux distros, OS kernels, Containers, programming languages - all are very different from bitcoin because technology has value while crypto _is_ value.
But objectively speaking it is still fair to expect multiple cryptocurrencies or even forks to co-exists. I mean we did it for the past 5 years, why would it stop now?  
If we would start treating crypto like other technology (like linux distros, programming languages) we would be better off since we could value it more objectively not politically.

Dude, you might be right, those cunts could be real fuckers up to no good. But that's not the point. Point is this way of argumenting - posting meme photos of facebook really proves nothing and just makes it difficult for people to find truth. 
In other words, it's FUD, by the very definition of the word. I'm not saying it's your fault for submitting this image, I'm just commenting on the general reddit crypto scene that stuff like that gets upvoted to the very top when it shouldn't be.

Dude, tracking vpn tokens based by the minute sounds like an extremely complex and costly thing to implement.
What is more simple for me as a consumer and a provider:  
* Pay 1 on chain payment of $3 to get a month long service 
* Establish a channel on another specific system, maintain that channel and whole ecosystem around it which is much more complex and check tokens every minute.  
As a developer who deals with shitton of vpns and proxies I'm losing hair just thinking of maintaining system like this.

It doesn't. 
Road map calls for dynamically adjustable block size. Hence the name bitcoinabc.
People will run the nodes as long as mining is profitable. And extra 50$ for a hard drive and better internet is hardly something when profit margins are so high.
Not to mention when companies depend on bitcoin network they will be happy to run a node for free as their business depend on it. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:52:51
You're pretty delusional if you think someone would bother setting up a system that would track vpn tokens and such by second or a minute for like 1 cent/hour rate:
Assume you want to stay competitive with monthly subscriptions that range between 3-8$, you'd get between $0.0044 to $0.011 an hour. Now divide that by 60 for by minute, or by 360 for by second, by this point you'll run out of decimal spaces.  
I don't think anyone would even bother to implement this for `per hour` tracking.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:10:17
That's a bit of a stretch isn't it?   
Mining gear is already extremely expensive so I don't think more bandwidth and more hard drive space is a big factor in mining cost. Majority of the cost is the processor and it would still be the case even with hundred megabyte blocks. 
1 bitmain miner is around ~~$3k~~ $4k right now. 1tb hard-drive is $50 and internet is limitless in most of the world with connection speed high enough to support huge ass blocks.   
Assuming you need to download 1 block every 10 minutes, untrimmed 1gb block you'd need a 150mbps connection and that's assuming it's raw untrimmed block. That's already average speed in majority of the developed world and 1gb blocks would still be at least a decade away from now.   
So lets do the math. 1 bitmain miner of 3k would need $50 hard drive and $30/month internet connection is hardly an argument for centralization.
To put it mildly: big block == centralization claim is completely unbased. It might make sense on paper if you ignore the math and the numbers, but in reality it hardly makes a difference. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:15:21


I never said that. I said if your argument that blocksize causes centralization then so does cheaper power and bitcoin is already centralized. However I never said I agree with this logic as I don't believe neither cheaper power nor cheaper hardware causes centralization, at least not in affect that breaks capitalistic principal of bitcoin.

What are you even talking about? You can run bitcoin on closed source client, who cares? It's the protocol that has to be open source. I can fork bitcoin core client and make my changes and run it - that's completely irrelevant. If my client is not getting rejected then it's a valid client. Can I mine with bitcoinabc client? it's a valid client, can I mine with my closed source modified client? it's a fucking valid client.

lol "I have no argument but I heard some smart people say it so I parrot it back".


150mbps would only be required in a decade or so, hopefully you backward-ass americans would get your infrastructure sorted by then. You can get reliable 60mbps unlimited 4g in big part of the world, currently have 60mbps 4g unlimited connection here in Thailand (with similar connection all around south east asia, not even mentioning europe).


It already is centralized to X countries because of energy requiredments. Major headline from today:  
However how important is this for decentralization? Current proof of work is flawed for this very reason and this battle is already lost no matter what you think.


Can you point to any of this math instead of saying "smart people made math that I cannot reference"? Do you plan to put any effort into your argument or will you continue the trend of parroting the headlines you read somewhere?  
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:00:09


Dude, BTC has way less available block space where BCH aims for unlimited dynamic block space (hense BitcoinABC - adjustable block size). No matter how you look at it BCH will always have smaller fees for on chain transaction, there's no way to argue against that.  
Lets say you fit 1k transacions in 1 BTC block of 1MB with efficiency of 1tx/0.001MB, even if you have lower efficiency of 1tx/0.009MB (unrealistic 9 times lesser efficiency) you would still fit more transactions in a 32MB block - 3.5k in total. 
That's not even delving into adjustable blocksize debate which makes this discussion even more moot.

@_date: 2018-02-23 07:38:02
You are delusional.


So your whole argument is based on a minute long artifact? 


When it comes to evaluation the only value that matters is the FIAT. If 1 BCH == BTC then the sat/B would drop significantly to compensate as only thing miners care is fiat output.   
Also BCH is about dynamic blocks so their scaling is completely different, you can't compare static system to a dynamic one.   
"If A was as popular as B it would have the same problems" is the most dumb thing you can possibly conjure when discussing two completely different architectual approaches. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:48:26
You really really are overthinking the complexity of bitcoin. Sure a lot of bells and whistles have been added but blockchain by itself is still driven by a lot of very simple concepts.  
The argument here is not whether Segwit works, but whether it's a smart direction to go to and whether it's worth adding so much complexity for so little actual benefit. 
If you want to have a standard, huge system as bitcoin you need to keep it simple stupid as much as possible.
