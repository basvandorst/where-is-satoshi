It's not just cryptos, Neural networks use GPUs as well. Those put a huge pressure on demand as well.

Trying to predict BTC price is like trying to predict the psychology of thousands of investors, speculators and general idiots because let's be honest, BTC price is only a result of hype buy vs panic sell, there is no such thing as internal value of BTC.

so you lost 2k in matter of 2 hours? wonderful.

Great potential for ripping off ignorant whales. Wonderful decentralized Ponzi scheme.

More like the last fooling opportunity.

I am not here to gloat on the losses that bitcoiners have now, but I believe they didn't do their homework well enough to understand what really drives the market price of financial instruments in short term and in long term. It doesn't take a genius to understand that bitcoin fails at all 3 functions of money: 
1. It is terrible as an **exchange instrument**. High transaction costs, huge latency. 
2. It is unable to **store value**. Money is supposed to be stable and least volatile. All these huge prices changes day after day act against this funtion of money. 
3. It is bad at **evaluating things**. This one is linked to point 2. It's pointless to value real tangible and intangible things in BTC because it has huge volatility. 
As much as bitcoiners like to hate on FED and fiat money, the USD and other currencies of developed countries at least, are trying to anchor the money supply on the total value of goods produced you can acquire with that money. Look at BTC, there is no counter value here to which the bitcoin supply is anchored. All this proof of work, electricity wasted on mining are just expenses to maintain the system (very wasteful btw). It is not linked in any way to market price of bitcoin, which at its very essence is a contest of supply and demand. This extreme market volatility of BTC is a result of it having no real internal value that would help to stabilize it's market price. 
You are basically riding the hype/depression wave with bitcoin. The HODL mantra is just a clever ploy to fool ignorant people into restricting the BTC supply and drive the price up, while the real market manipulators rip the rewards from speculation. Learn this lesson well and don't get yourself fooled by mysterious and magical get rich quick schemes. When the the risk free interest rates can even be negative, expecting high yields with little risk is downright stupid. I would kill for a good investment opportunity with 7,2% p.a. with low risk and here we have poeple that expect 30%, 50%, 100% returns in a few months.

Lol, so Bitcoiners often express their disdain for fiat money, but it's an increase in fiat supply that they really want :) 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:16:14
Bitcoin has hit a wall. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:58:25
There is absolutely no guarantee that this pattern will repeat. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:21:28
Yeah, we all need to increase the authority of those that support the HODL mantra. Otherwise our big Ponzi scheme will fail to continue. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:51:45
Yeah yeah, buy into all those that have decided to bail out of the Ponzi scheme. Perfect timing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:35:57
lol, yet another variation of: "this is good for bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:12:10
Yeah yeah! Spread the the  mantra of the Bitcoin Ponzi scheme: HODL! Hey fellow bitcoin owners, don't sell your bitcoins please now, as you will flood the market and the price will drop. Just hold, ok??? Let me wait till the price will go up enough so i can recoup my losses. 
No! You already lost. You want to see yourself losing more? Fine! Enjoy going deeper into the well. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:07:20
There is no real meaningful competitive advantage inherent to bitcoin compared to other cryptos. Yeah, one uses APIC for mining, other is better with GPU (seriously fuck Ethereum for jacking up GPU prices). Bitcoin is a ledger that has nothing on other cryptos except for being the first one and the most popular. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:21:59
sure, dude, I'll just grab some popcorn and enjoy the drama
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:01:10
I have nothing against people that do the smart thing and expose themselves to positive side of randomness while taking care and being careful with the rest of their assets. But those that keep more than 20% of their wealth is just pure madness. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:09:46
A well educated investor will not short either. The super high volatility of BTC can ruin both those that buy now, those that hold and those that short. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:16:52
And you think you understand Bitcoin so well as to predict it being a good investment tool?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:55:33


I didn't put a single dime into bitcoin either, but it is hilarious as hell to follow all the drama. :) If only people educated themselves and looked at bitcoin from a market instrument perspective rather than "technology" and bla bla. There is no competitive advantage in bitcoin. Hell even Ethereum offers more. Bitcoin will go back to where it came in 2018. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:08:42
Don’t use the word **investment** when you are essentially talking about **speculation**. Buying Bitcoin is not a investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:25:53
Proof of work is one of the most enviromentally damaging algorithms every invented by humanity. I would tax the hell out of anyone mining cryptos that use proof of work. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:04:32
How would one finance his business with cryptocurrencies please? Let's say I need a loan. How will cryptocurrencies replace the banks?

I had that inner EU4 vibe from your post :D Good luck on your campaign. Smolensk is crazy fun when you get to improve your fire combat phase with all the available ideas. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:11:56
This is why in the long term bitcoin cannot sustain this return. It does not create real world value like the S&amp;P 500 companies. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:55:31
When big shit happens, you use your financial reserves and buy whatever you need for survival. In this case you will try to trade your bitcoin for something of value, and thus increase the bitcoin supply on market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:03
How many BTC did you buy in december? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:29:34
Are you 16?
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:39:30
Please do, i wanna see your arguments.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:43:53
Whatever bitcoin enables you to do, can be replicated by other hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there. Regarding inherent value: those that buy bitcoin and hold it, they emulate the behaviour of investors. They buy an asset and hope that its value (which will be reflected in price) will grow in time. 
Take a stock for example. It does have inherent value. The value of a stock can be calculated by all the assets - liabilities and adding the discounted future profits. Whatever disaster, paranoia, overhype happens on the market that shifts the price in whatever direction, there is always something tangible and intangible you have the right to when you own that stock. Hence, the inherent value.
With bitcoin it does not apply. As an owner of bitcoin you are only entitled to transfer the token to some other wallet on the blockchain. Nothing more, nothing less. 
You invoke the argument that **money** has no inherent value, but you treat bitcoin as an **investment tool**, like a **stock**, and you expect its price to grow like the price of a **stock**. Once you treat bitcoin like an investment tool, i can put forward the inherent value argument. 
If you still push for the bitcoin=money, then i just don't need bitcoin now. There is no such asset in the world that I cannot buy with regular money.

This, hodlers help others get out of the ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:05:55
You are implying that there will be a demand for Venezuela cryptocurrency. I never felt need for their local currency, now will I want to buy their crypto.

You are probably a europa universalis player :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:42:26
War and floods will impact bitcoin anyway. The demand for bitcoin will decrease and the supply will increase, the price will go down and you will acquire less valuable items with it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:24:29
please do
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:09:56
1. Bitcoin has no internal value
2. Bitcoin price is only a result of supply vs demand
3. When you buy bitcoin you are betting that the future demand will increase. 
4. Do you really want to gamble your hard earned money on your ability to predict something psychological like the human hype?

if this is not sarcasm, then let me answer you that math and interconnected nodes do no have inherent value.

no no no! The are investing in **technology** !!!
