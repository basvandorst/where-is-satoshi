This got too technical for ELI5, but I'm sure that I'll get this once I've gotten the hang of how bitcoins work. Thanks!

Alright! I will ruminate on this all :D
But wait! Where exactly to video chat?

Should I worry about the private key or not so much as long as I don't go around leaving my wallet open or something?


But I tend to blur/desaturate the backgrounds on my photos (since I'm paranoid that way). Is that acceptable?


I already have a blockchain wallet, does this mean I should deposit the bitcoins into a Coinbase account that I create? Or is there a comparable way on the Blockchain one? Also, I don't have a bank account :/

Oh, I just asked because I read somewhere that it automatically does that for you, so my question was "it can't possibly do that for incoming automatically, right?". It was very confusing, to say the least.

oh wow  that would be really difficults :/ but I guess safer in the long run

so, the address is anonymous but once used as verification or something, anonymous only to the extent that this reddit account is anonymous?
By private keys, do you mean the wallet? Or is there yet another thing that goes more technical than that?
Would a donation account be pretty much the address that one uses for verification in this case?
Also, I saw an ad for bitinstant. Would converting btcoins to paypal this way let people know what my paypal is, or is this something that doesn't show up? I mean, what would be the safest way to withdraw bitcoins into real cash?

1) So for example, I post to with 1 address in my verification (which to my understanding is how one gets tipped), I *can* keep using that address... yes? (I mean, it's pretty much safe for me, not so much for anyone who doesn't really want their spending habits traceable?)
Q1) I was pretty much only concerned with incoming, but it's nice to know this too (very nice, actually... I seem to ask silly questions and forget some that I should know)

So, tell me about how exactly people can get their hands on my private keys. I mean, is it simply a case of not doing anything stupid like keeping a copy of it on Notepad in my computer (and other things to the same effect)? Another thing, I've come to the conclusion the private key is the sequence of numbers that would be my identifier... yes?
I have a question about Vv, since I see you're a mod. How exactly does this work (without giving away too much of what you look for)? On what is the video chat hosted? One would not have to expose one's face to Vv, yes? Just stuff like that, my paranoia is functioning.
I see (thanks for the info, will look up more stores that accept bitcoin)! But what are your thoughts on BTCPak? I noticed it in the blockchain wallet thing.
I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my queries! :D
