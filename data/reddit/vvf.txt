Tell that to my sibling whose bank account got emptied on a whim when they were 10 years old. It was money from birthdays and Christmas. But it was associated with our parents so they took it all.

Perhaps you could also carry decoy ones with you. If it's even possible to figure out which one is the decoy when you mix them up.

Do you think that all scammers don't know they're making mistakes?

I don't participate in these brigades, but I'm sorry about the bad shibes.

I learned in econ that fractional reserve banking was supposed to make economic growth easier. It doesn't seem like fraud to me at all. Part of choosing a bank involves assessing whether it will honor its agreement to pay you back what it owes you. If you want somewhere to store money, those are easy to come by. It's called a safe.

Libertarians lean toward as little government as possible. Some libertarians want no government at all, but at that point you're an anarcho-capitalist imo. So libertarians are in favor of legalizing drugs, lowering or abolishing taxes, pulling out of the middle east. Amusingly, they're still split on abortion but I think most are pro choice.

This Bitcoin tribalism is silly. 
I like both Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Dogecoin has its place, and so does Bitcoin. 
"we" don't want to be enemies of Bitcoin. I support Doge because I think it will contribute to the success of cryptocurrency as a whole. 
Bitcoin is the biggest, but it doesn't have to be the *only* crypto, and nor does Doge.

I agree completely, it's just funny to me that there's a split.

Scammers might make mistakes intentionally so that smarter people don't waste their time.

What's stopping you from having a bunch of different wallets? How does the robber know that you haven't given him everything?

I had this thought immediately before I read your comment. It freaked me out a little. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:44:59
:) it was basic econ, they preached the value of Keynesian economics too. But without fractional reserve, a bank is just a really nice safe.

No, I'm smarter than people who think the Federal reserve is looking out for the little guy.

Robbing millions of people while operating a banking cartel? Yup, they're pros.
