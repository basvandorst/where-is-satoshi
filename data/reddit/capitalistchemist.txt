(mod of here)
has no role in the saga of bitcoin drama. If this continues to be a hot button issue on what I'm inclined to do is move all crypto related subreddits out of our 'Sister Subreddits' list and into the 'Related Subreddits' list. Readers on ancap seem to get an impression of allegiance out of the former. And when such communities are undergoing internal conflict I don't want to give the impression that we're taking a side, we have enough infighting amongst ourselves to keep us occupied already.
No one is being banned. Posts aren't being removed. All that may happen is a link on the sidebar moves from one list to another to relieve an impression of strict alignment that we're not trying to make. Remember, subreddits in the sidebar are operated by different people. If ancap readers sympathize with some and dislike others, that's their prerogative. A link should not be taken as a blanket endorsement, not to an ancap writer (ancaps have significant internal disagreement) and not to a related subject with as much internal disagreement, they should just be seen as links that many readers of may find interesting.

That would also be exploitable.

Savings is critical to the overall economy. It coordinates the present to the future along with spending. When people save - or don't consume - they value the future value over the present value. When they consume, they value the present over the future. Many people in an economy figuring out what's best for them is how things get allocated efficiently.
You speak of deflationary collapse. It is insanity - it violates the law of demand at face value. The person saying 'wow, prices have fallen by half, I better not spend my savings because prices may be lower tomorrow' is ridiculous. It is certain he will spend some of that accumulated purchasing power. Look what the people with bitcoin savings did with the recent huge price deflation: people purchased stuff (dollars).
Is bitcoin wicked because some committee can't ctrl-p them into existence or command base interest rates? We're seeing dramatic volatility as bitcoin goes from being a tiny niche to a medium niche, it'll level out.

It's off and on. Lots of people panicking = more volatility to trade around. Last night was great, hopefully tonight will be good too.
I wonder how long this frenzy will last.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:33:31
I think I made like 8% before it went down... This volatility is really exciting. Hopefully it comes back online soon.

And if everyone spent everything they earned, prices would explode and people wouldn't have cash reserves when unexpected things happened.
It's an equilibrium - savings versus spending. You speak of savings as if it's a sin. Are you an uber-Keynesian ?

I'm hoping that things went through because my buy order was showing up before the crash and it doesn't show up now on clarkmoody.

If someone drops the price of bitcoin to $1 by dumping their 100k reserves, I'll gladly purchase a thousand of them. I think at least 99 people here will take the other 99k. There can only be so many 100k dumps, after they happen the coins are distributed to more people.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:51:07
Ever heard of savings?
@_date: 2013-01-02 02:50:55
It's possible someone is bidding above the ask for some reason, but not buying a large enough volume to touch the large orders.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:38:14
Sure, I think it's probably not very safe to buy in at this point. I'm not putting more cash in. I'll remain profitable even if the price drops a good bit, and the money I invested I consider lost anyway.
In not too long things will calm down, and buying won't be nearly as treacherous. Deposit USD somewhere if you actually think you may use it, then just don't buy BTC with it until you think it's safe enough. If that day never comes just withdraw losing the fees.

'If you don't like it you can get out', a classic argument from desperation.

I'll gladly try it out, thanks!

'Hoarding' is a nasty way of saying 'saving'. This idea that saving is bad and spending is good is ridiculous. Both are necessary, they exist in an ever changing equilibrium. When people save they are valuing future consumption over consumption right now, and when they spend they're favoring the present over the future. In a free market, the levels of savings versus spending would be based on the collective knowledge and actions of everyone participating in the economy. Their collective intelligence cannot ever be matched by a group of a dozen bankers. It is presumptuous to say 'this is what the correct rate of inflation is', how can a central planner possibly know this? No one knows what the correct price of bitcoin is tomorrow, if they did they'd be very wealthy. How can anyone possible know how many bitcoins they should print of void out of existence to maximize social utility? They can't. Bitcoin was in large part created to circumvent these kinds of controls that apply to almost all other currencies.
The 'deflation ruins everything' scenario also directly contradicts the most basic interpretation of the law of demand. What happens when prices go down? Quantity demanded goes up. The idea that people will hold off forever for a moderately better deal down the road is equally ridiculous. Cell phones and computers are a great example of goods experiencing serious deflation. Do you see every cell phone owner saying 'I'm not going to buy a smart phone because I want to wait for a better one'? Perhaps some people do this, but plenty of others don't. The current correction in bitcoin demonstrates this same principle. When bitcoin deflated enough, people cashed out in a big way. Now things will re-equilibrate.

I'd hardly call selling a 60gh/s for $30k selling out for pennies on the dollar. Whoever buys it will likely never make are return on their investment, at least not in the next few years.
On the other hand, the guy who's selling the machine can take those profits and turn them into a much larger mining operation. Or, he could take them and purchase a fraction of a percent of the whole bitcoin supply. If I'd preordered an ASIC miner months ago I'd certainly be selling it now too. That's way more profitable than keeping it and mining for a year. If you don't lock in your floating profits they evaporate away, if you do lock them in you may be able to compound them into something more.

You are a statist by your own admission, you want the state. If you are not a statist you're an anarchist, which you clearly aren't. Calling a statist a statist isn't an insult, or at least you (as a statist) shouldn't think so.

It's a gold rush and it's time to sell shovels if you've got them.

Interesting. He's possibly the source of the attack - not the post. The article is off of mtgox's official google plus page.

That's the best part.

The USD is a much larger market. Day traders can make/lose huge amounts of money on tiny % swings. If bitcoin were a commonly used currency used by hundreds of millions of people, I doubt you'd see double digit % swings.
There's nothing wrong with profiting from the ongoing chaos. Besides, my profits are in BTC not USD.

Not the entire website, the support desk still works.
