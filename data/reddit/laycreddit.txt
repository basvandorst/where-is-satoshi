No it has been unstable for quite a while. Sometimes it took me ~200-300 attempts till my orders where accepted. The website timed out most of the time or showed some other error messages. Now I use their API (clikraken) and it works way better.

How you want to keep the BTC price stable if it can't handle enough transactions to work stable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:46:20
You can set a limit to buy/sell instead of selling/buying for the market price on Kraken but their service is really unstable at the moment.

Had no problem to withdrawl €20.000 at once but ofc they had to review it. Took about 3 days till I received my money but I used my german Fidor bank account (Fidor is partnered with Kraken). I don't know if there is a difference to US bank accounts as Kraken is located in San Francisco, isn't it?
They have a support-subreddit:

My mom has a larger crypto portfolio than me... :(

Sure, I'm not even good at predictions. I guess the price will probably go down after the fork because there are many people who dumped their altcoins to buy BTC and may they switch back afterwards but it should still be profitable.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:11:43
Because it makes sense to buy BTC before it forks. Free money, B2X Futures trades at +$1000 (

More likely they do Gods work because there is no god so they do nothing.

So happy I chose Kraken as main traiding platform. They seem to be the white knights of crypo-exchanges.

Schekel Schekel :) Great news.

They should have ripped the seized pages of Hansa and AlphaBay. They look way cooler :D
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:27:00
I will thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:08:44
Puh. Following the latest news I'm quite happy I stayed with Kraken. BTC-e hacked Mt.Gox, now so many complains about Coinbase ...
I hope you will get your money back soon. May their support is just busy with the fork-consequences.

€dit: Whoops he bought BitcoinCash.org for $50k but he also owns Bitcoin.com
I literally googled "Who the fuck is Roger Ver" and the first thing I found was "Is Roger Ver's bitcoin.com a scam site? For me, the answer is YES ..." (
This Roger guy seems like a worse version of Martin Shkreli.

Someone posted the "Do something"-meme =&gt; Bitcoin drops

I guess you are right. I've seen a few of his streams and he seems like a normal guy but as someone who  suffers from a chronic illness with medications which would costs about 20.000€ a month I understand why people hate him/the company he worked for.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:18:06


More likely a job for Interpol/Europol ect. and there is no way they should get rewarded for that. It is their job to investigate and prosecute and they get paid for doing so (taxes) but the money should go to Mt.Gox and their customers who lost the money.
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:10:35
Some would be upset and fork to BTC Pepsi.

Hahaha Rekt! I love seeing stories of success like this.
Let's see how the next years go, I'd love to do the same!

Do you guys really think I point all usecases of Gold since beginning of time? That was just the most obvious things that came in my mind. Gold has way more usecases than Bitcoin because BTC is restricted. It could be so much more but it won't because it does not have the capacity nor has LN. It will need something better to gain adoption and to get apps running on BTC blockchain or games or a hole infastructure.
Also if you say payments are not a usecase of bitcoin you pretty much say Satoshi, the inventor of bitcoin was wrong when he wrote his whitepapers about his decentralized electronic cash system. Also I want to mention that Gold once has been a cash system.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:52:01
We have LN for over a year now and it is still not widely adopted. I don't believe it can hold up to what BTC would need for all the users who want to use BTC when a bullrun starts.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:04:55
You are probably right. That's why I left reddit a year ago but I posted it here because I didn't want everyone agree with my point of view. I just wanted to know how want to improve on those issues. I did not want to shittalk BTC just a normal discussion but it seems like some people on this subreddit are too grumpy to accept BTC isn't perfect.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:09:13
First the US go for Oil now for coins.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:15:58
It has no 8 trillion market cap but because of it's usecases it's price went from $.30 in 1960 to $4.5 in 2010...

A russian exchange for Bitcoin and some altcoins. The owner probably hacked Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:46:16
I don't know what you read or why you think I shorted Bitcoin. I dont want anyone to FOMO or to shittalk BTC. All I want to know is how they want to fix this big issue of not being able to send or receive payments when BTC is gaining more users (what will happen because the price increases and people come back who lost money back in 2017)
I hold BTC and I use it daily/weekly to pay things online. That's what it was made for. I've been buying and spending BTC since 2014 back when it was meant as payment system.
How do you think it will be worth 1 mil dollar if no one can spend it because the mempool has to many transactions on hold?
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:10:57
You seem to understand what I meant. I don't want to shittalk BTC or think other coins will be supirior. All I want is a reliable BTC so that new users who start using it see that it is working and I doubt thats the BTC we have today. I think the idea of LN is good but it has not been adopted. At least 70% of my payments are still normal non-LN transactions because no one uses it and already knowing the fees are going crazy and the bubble will pop again and again is sad.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:35:56
I agree futures had a huge impact but not being able to send/receive BTC killed the adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:51:37
Aha and what impact would it have for me to troll? What makes this post so suspicious?
I'm not trashtalking anything I simply look for a solution. I'm asking what is the plan to improve the problem that transactions keep getting stuck on hold with sometimes days to go through when even more people join? I don't make any thing up it's just facts.
Look at the stats:
While this thread is live there are 10.000 more transactions stuck.
But if you think I'm a new world order troll trying to infiltrate this sub to shoot scalarwaves at you to kill you slowly over tens of years its okay for me.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:28:13
Sure but people care. In my opinion BTC will only survive if people start using it but if someone who bought BTC in 2017 comes back to try it again and sees nothing changed they will be pissed and may loose faith in blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:32:15
Gold is a store of value because it has many usecases. Most electrionics, every smartphone, computer, TV has Gold in it. Saying BTC is a store of value and shouldn't be used for payments is no valid argument in my opinion. If no one uses or can use Bitcoin because of instable mempool or high fees it has no value. You pay for the name.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:35:52
I should call myself a BTC Caterpillar
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:55:22
I can't find the article. You are probably right. I guess it was not about transactions but transaction volume or they just included the zero value transactions or it was just fake news. Sorry didn't want to make anything up.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:30:46
Thanks for your comment. May I'm not patient enough but LN is live for over a year now and adoption does not seem to be where it should be considering more payments online are now made with cryptos than PayPal.
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:13:51
You pretty much said the same I do. I don't know why the fuck you guys always have to stiff on the usecases of gold. That's not what my thread was about.
You say bitcoin is not ready as payment system but that is what is was meant to be. Read the white papers again, it is a electronic cash system also known as a crypto currency and by saying it is not ready as payment system it also means it is not ready for a new bullrun at the moment. The bubble will pop again and again. I'm not saying BTC won't be superior but not short term because it is not were it needs to be.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:58:20
Sure it improved but I think they could have done more and should do it before it is too late. I know how hard it is to update/upgrade BTC and how long it will take to do so but I hope you are right.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:41:20
First of all I didn't post this to get price predictions or anything. I don't care in the price I care in adoption and usability to use BTC as payment system. I hodl BTC too but I don't see it as store of value.
I've never developed a SW but there are enough well experienced people who earn good money to do so and as in every other job or software it should not be seen as miracle to debug something before releasing it.
Thinking about Satioshi did this all by himself with the help of a small team it shouldn't be that hard to do so in a big expirienced team and I don't think LN holds up to what it should do. Especially if you can create yourself a testnet easily to test your improvments.
I like the idea of LN but I don't like that it will kind of centralize BTC to a few big LN-nodes knowing each other. Increasing the blocksize would have helped shortterm but I understand that LN is the better solution longterm. I just don't think LN or BTC as it is right now can handle a new '17 like bullrun and would like to see how to improve it.
