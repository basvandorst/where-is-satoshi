a little bit too romatic maybe, but I'll believe in your sincerety since I have no reason to do otherwise.
I'd just add that "most of the popular things in life are formed by the illeteracy and ignorance of the average joe, and running an effective cencorship on the main information channels for years doesnt really help" Hope bitcoin will be the legacy we dream of it to be.

It was somewhat useable around august. Sometimes it'd make you enter orders twice or so, but you could log in and browse at least. Lately I wasnt even able to login for days...Finally I freaked out when I couldnt log in for a week, and the the first chance I managed to, I ran away with everything I got there.

he is promoting what he believes is right as far as I'm concerned. doesnt everybody ? I think people should think why would someone who owns that much btc wants to overthrow the crown? I dont hold a single bch btw. I'm just observing this fight between btc and bch.

reminds me how my 7 year old played my clash of clans game on my phone, and I had never spent any gems on it for like 2 years. hodling them like btc lol. then one day I checked it out to see the gems were spent and they were spent on cosmetic shit like statues and stuff...
hope your gems wont be spent for useless shit op
