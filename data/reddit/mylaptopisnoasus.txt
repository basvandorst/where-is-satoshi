For them to not loose too much stake they need to value the company at leat $140.000.000. I would be surprised if they offer 36%. I think 20% max. That would value the company $300.000.000  . Crazy but it might work (because you get a 60% discount if you buy these dollars in the form of bfx)

Hi, i'm whale. At what valuation do i get equity? I don't want to pay a premium and last round valuation was below 50m! I want controling stake. Ktnxforthecompanybye

I don't think they should.. I think they want. 100% would be very cool. Ownership and voting kinda like  
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:51:41
My understanding is they are trying to buy an already existing country. haha

Lightning wont solve those specific fees. Lightning will be super cheap for transactions but you're going to pay those fees twice creating and settling a channel.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:10:33
You seem to think that the world is going to explode with larger blocksizes. I think you are exaggerating trying to make a some (weird) point?!. Yes, you need servers to handle 1000s request per second but the same goes for large lightning channels providing liquidity to the lightning networks also for proprietary like visa and paypal. 
People want afforable onchain transaction and secondary layer networks in the future. The only problem with btc is core preventing affordable onchain transactions now in favour of lightning in the future. This is hurting users now without any good reason. Increasing the blocksize to 2mb will clear the mempool and lower the fees back to ~zero. The blockchain is at max capacity as more transaction are coming in than going out. The fees are spiraling out of control because of this. The solution is so simple just double the blocksize now and deal with second / third layers later. 
Edit: And when second layers arrive people won't be pleased if they need to pay $20 dollar fees for the on- and off-ramp to the lighning/second layer network.

I didn't anylyse the data but heard people saying it is the exchange xapo that sold al its btc and now is collecting all its dust in order to sell.. Creating transactions with many inputs
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:24:42
No, you would not lose your coins ever. A so called "ban" makes it "illegal" to trade coins for that countries fiat. In your case euro's. In practice that would mean you'll won't be able to trade your coins on a german exchange, it will probably be a harder to pay for products or services from german companies, not at all for government bodies or earning your salary in coins instead of euro's. They cannot stop you from trading person to person or with companies outside Germany.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:23:39
No, i dont think spam will be a problem. If transactions have a fee and miners are willing to mine them it will be included in the next block and miners will profit. If spam is unbearable miners can impose an higher minimal fee for coins recently moved. Move coins again within one block? Sure but the minimal fee will be x times 32. Within 2 blocks x times 16. Etc etc. Slowing spam down wothout any implications for normal users.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:47
The chain will only grow by the size of the txs mined inside the blocks. The point of larger blocks being that the blocks are never full so users wont have to compete by paying insane amounts of fees. If the chain is growing "exponentially" that would be a good thing because it means adoption is growing exponentially. In theory you only need dozens of miners in different countries to prevent government from taking down the network just like there are only a few root dns server making it censorship resistant. In practice there will be many more as mining is profitable and barier to enter the market quite low. Personally i think you are the one not very bright and not understanding the underlying economics.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:42:07
It doesn't stop transaction spamming. But that has nothing to do with high fees right now. The blocks are full and people are competing to get included in the blocks. Driving price up. 
If miners don't want to include low fee transactions ("spam") they wont include them regardless of block size. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:16:38
I guess they can but the probabilty would be very very very low.
@_date: 2014-09-12 09:55:21


Just count al the single "one time use code"s generated 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:12:22


It is worth it if the price of both combined is net postive
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:33:05
You cant call hyperinflation after just one full cycle.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:49:58
It would be obviously hyperinflation **if** it would get worse and worse and worse. But that is an "if". For now it is just inflation. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:01:25
Yes, offcourse. I was directly replying to OP who is talking about jumping around supposedly results in a negative effect on the "price of the assets". Miners won't mind negatively effect one coin if it results in a postive on their bottomline. Which is obvious otherwise they would not be "jumping arround" right now. The "investment in equipment" represent a value on both chains (but not both at once).
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:55:08
I started with the realistic view (0.1% more since bch's creation **edit**). Yes bitcoin cash inflated more than bitcoin. That fact doen't magically make it hyperinflation though.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:26:59
Time will tell. But the current state is not hyperinflated. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:35:55
The ones paying the bills hand out the "jobs". ie. not core developers but people with skin in the game (the market) and the network itself that the miners create (12.5 coin per block)
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:34:11
Bitcoin cash inflated 0.1% more than bitcoin. Calling it hyperinflation is a bit disingenuous.
Cash is only 0.00292081035% ahead in total blocks
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:44:08
If you transact you are part of the free market. It doesn't matter how much you hold the "let the market decide" is about were the money flows. Whales or how much you own is irrelevant. It sounds like you want crypto to be some sort of democracy? You think whales are assholes by not selling their bitcoin cash? What is your point?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:12:14
If they are willing to sell at a loss it means your opportunity to profit is even bigger than theirs! 
You should be mad at yourself for not buying it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:53:02
You seem to think it is "ridiculous" they do not use excess power for mining but you are not applying logic. If you buy the electricity wholesale your potential profit is the same as theirs + the discount. E.g. an even higher profit. They are not doing it for the same reasons you are not doing it. It is hard to mine profitable in europe/germany only using cheaper than cost power. If they would lose less money mining than selling wholesale they would certainly do it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:35:00
No, the power is never free! It has a cost and they are selling below cost instead of waisting it (100% loss). If the power were free they could sell at any price and still make a profit. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:30:11
True, but batteries are not the only way to store that energy. For example you can produce hydrogen and store it for 30 years in a warehouse. Albeit not as dense as crude oil. People want to use that energy not store it long term :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:46:07
True, that is a possibility. But if that is the case there is also currently an oppurtinity in market for  to make a profit. If the electricity company could generate more revenue mining than selling below cost. Anybody could buy the power and generate that same revenue making a profit. So he should still be more mad at himself for not taking that opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:35:51
Why all the trouble? Why would anyone opening this up, stealing the coins, go to the trouble to make it seem it was not tempered with?! Its not like you can stop them after the fact.
**edit:** Ok guys, good points. Well i'll bring it to my friend with x-ray machine instead
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:29:29
That is fine and dandy. Do not trust without critical thinking.
Still ops post is weird because that is how it is supposed to work.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:05:07
You don't have to trust anyone. But if you can't trust anyone that "copy pastes" (fork) open source software you 'd be better of living in the woods.  Without forking we would have no internet, linux, android, osx, ios. nothing.  
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:08:36


The BBC i guess, they were doing the story.  
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:30:24
Man, you are delusional. They do what is beneficial for themselves in the market. It is their choice not the users. You can't fire anyone.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:05:35
This man is going to rule his one-man operation like a dictator with an iron fist! 
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:32:42
This sounds like a very risky way to ensure access to the coins long term. Usb thumb drives aren't known for having a long lifespan. In the event you dying it may very well be ancient technology. 
Why not just print the private key (encrypted), store it in a vault, put it in your will and leave clear instructions. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:30:00
I think these miners want to a guarantee a 2mb hf. Otherwise there is the  risk of parties not holding up that side of the deal.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:02:09
Here is a more realistic explenation and also touches on the question of "fake" nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:30:39
Uhm.... if you fork i will be on both chains. :)
@_date: 2017-06-10 07:32:50
withdrawals only means withdrawals only.. so no buying and no selling (to yourselves)
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:09:57
Thats why the developers of 2x took the segwit part and are only adding the 2x part. 2mb is agreed upon in the hk agreement.
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:03:25


I agree it doens't measure anything. But you are delusional to think economic consensus is just based on transactions. Somebody with 1000 coins can obviously move the market more than 100 people with each a coin. Hence that person has more power in economic consensus. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:41:04
I missed the word **holding**.. my bad.
