Imho we're on the verge of reaching a stage where bitcoin mining will be controlled by a hand full of companies and a "network consensus" will be agreed on by the "bitcoin elite" meeting at some secret locations much like the Bilderberg's.

Awesome job! It broke transporting of open assets on the btc chain with the change to the dust limit. Some assets still transfer and dividends will "eventually" confirm. However larger assets that have a wider use or larger number of owners are running risk to get stuck on the chain and cancelled since some share owners might not own enough shares to receive a payment + the 600 satoshi color tag.

A functioning Foundation would work "with" the developers and drive bitcoin adoption and badly needed core updates.

nothing you need to do. eventually one of the transactions will expire. Tons of confirmation issues on the network since the latest core update. Looks like a "bug" in dust limits. If it is not a bug then it's a ridiculous change which hasn't been documented.

more than an altcoin. Read the white-paper before commenting.
@_date: 2015-05-19 23:46:14
GHcloud is much more. The wallet service is decentralized with user accounts only existing on the users end (in LocalData) and you're also in control of your private keys. There is no hot wallets or "hacked" drama since the wallet server only connected the user with the blockchain.
Then there is GHpool, the GHfarm page with everything relevant to the mining operation and the GHcoin / GHX page, the GH mining asset. Being build now is more suport for open asset portfolio management, detailed stats on all assets in a users portfolio and a P2P asset marketplace utilizing atomic swap transacting which will be rolled out with GHcloud v1.0.
What is badly needed though for assets build on the openassets protocol is a btc core wallet packaged with colorcore. I'm pretty sure that we'll see one being released some time this year at which point the true strength of smart assets will become a lot more obvious to a lot of people.
We don't hype much around GH but we sure develop a lot. Come and check it out.

You should never use an online wallet to transfer BTC between a gaming site and the provider. Always move the funds to your own wallet(s) and deposit/withdraw to the sites from there. Coinbase is right in closing the account (though they could provide more detail) since they would put themselves into trouble for processing gambling transactions in line with the UIGEA bill from 2006.
Here is a link to a decent article on "how-to setup yourself to gamble with bitcoins". Though this article uses Blockchain.info as intermediate (over a local or mobile wallet), it's still decent.
The new SwC software is btw terrible and crashes a lot. You might be better off signing up for  flagship of the first bitcoin poker "network" powered by Enterra.

I can do without those "gateways" since they are part of the continued walling of increasing the block size in favour of "higher transaction fees".

You don't have to lie, just don't tell. Sadly many people are so used to trust others (banks) with their money that they do not use BTC they way it is meant to be used and thus always encounter problems like this one again and again. Online poker is widely regulated or,if not, illegal and nobody can expect a service provider such as Coinbase to put their business at risk for processing illegal gambling transactions. This should be really a no-brainer.
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:40:56

If you provide an asset address for the crowd sale instead of the associated BTC address then you can ensure that you'll only receive  payments from a "color aware" wallet / address.
If the asset uses the openassets protocol then it can be received (or stored) on Coinrism and on their mobile up, in a GHcloud account (works fine on mobile too). You can also store assets with Armory and TREZOR

I doubt that you have to tell them, in detail, what your plans are for your bitcoins. I guess one wouldn't use BTC for the sole purpose of gambling but I get your point.
Fortunately things are very different where I live thanks to providers such as e-coin and Bit2Me. I barely use Coinbase or Kraken any more and I wish every country would have the same options available we have here. It would do wonders for bitcoin adoption.

It doesn't have the infrastructure and eco-system (aka real life use application) which was created for Bitcoin over the last 9 years. No coin has which is why Bitcoin will always prevail.
Or do you think that all merchants, companies, bars, venues AND BTC users will all of a sudden turn around and ALL switch their integration to BCH after it took forever to get them to accept BTC in the first place? If so, why haven't they done this already with ANY other coin? LTC, DASH, BLK, DODGE (lol)? There is many coins out there which have a better protocol and more functionality over Bitcoin and until today NONE has ever been able to run BTC from the number  spot on the market cap.
So "this" BCH coin will finally succeed and basically become the "bitcoin killer" because Roger and friends say so?
Think again.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:00:00
I do know how markets (especially crypto) works. At least I'll make that claim after having dedicated the last 6+ years of my live to this space. I also agree, BTC should be valued somewhere around 0.1 BTC. The early spike to 0.3 BTC and recent spikes to above 0.2 are just laughable.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:01:19
It wasn't "just a fork". It was a live fork from the BTC chain dumping the same coin supply as BTC had on all BTC owners. At that point nobody had ever invested a single $ into that coin and thus the actual value was $0. It was than pushed up to 0.30 BTC/coin shortly after the fork without having ANY impact on BTC's price. This clearly showed that there was NO REAL MONEY in BCH at that time. Even now with the coins hashrate and the supply of "new coins" it's absolutely over-valued and it has to ,and will, pop.
Also, how is the protocol any better? Because they changed a few lines to increase the block size from 1 to 8 MB and a few more? It "could" perhaps, one day, in the future, become the better coin with a better protocol but that has to be seen. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:14:23
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:01:34
BCH will never become the longer chain and even if it does, it still doesn't change the fact that there is no eco-system for this coin. BTC's took 9 years to build. So what makes you think that EVERYONE will update their integration to switch to this altcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:13:02
well said!
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:53:45
Until people cash out. BCH's market cap isn't real. It was created out of thin air on the day the fork. If it was real then BTC should have dropped. Instead it gained over 50% in one month. The only real money currently in BCH is the one coming from newly mined coins and people not dumping.
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:04:12
finally, someone who gets it. +1
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:47:26
What most people don't seem to get is that BTC's price even remained stabled when BCH first touched 0.30 BTC/coin. So, anyone who has been around for a while )and who knows how the crypto-currency markets actually work) should have realized that moment that BCH's market cap isn't real. You can't climb to 30% of BTC's value without causing BTC to drop because.... where does the money come from?
The answer is quite simple. By forking "live" from the BTC chain they basically "dumped" BTC's coin supply on all BTC owners and thus basically created money (market cap) out of thin air. 
If there ever has been a bubble in crypto, this is it and it's deemed to pop once people realize this and start dumping BCH for BTC.
In addition that BCH network hashrate keeps jumping like a rubber ball. In my opinion Bitmain or another of Ver's buddies is doing temp switching to pump BCH's marketing and price. However, the hashrate is not consistent. 
If anything it's an effort to further divide the community. Personally I'm sad to see that Roger has changed so much. He has done great things over the years for Bitcoin but I think he lost it. Shame, I used to have a lot of respect for that man back in the days or better until just recently.

@_date: 2015-08-17 22:40:51


I might disagree. GetHashing has already released a web wallet as part of GHcloud and the entire platform is as decentralized as it can get. GHcloud puts the user in full control of their account info and their wallets (including the private keys) both stored on the users system and the atomic swap exchange came online a few weeks ago. Throw in the probably most transparent mining operation in the crypto space and you've got an awesome platform.
Almost forgot the color aware (multi-coin) block chain explorer currently in alpha and public dev.


Why wasn't contributing to an existing protocol (or enhancing one of them) an option?


Yeah? Faster adoption than BTC? Cause I would think that any asset protocol would seek BTC's mainstream adoption first else or how is the mainstream going to adopt an open asset protocol (let alone spin their head around it) if the majority is still being ignorant about cryptocurrencies in general?
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:13:27

@_date: 2015-07-08 14:43:44


Makes sense, not. The implementation of floating fees in core 0.10 is a joke and now we really want to increase block size on top of it. If anything then the last week has proven that we're far from read for mainstream adoption. At the current state BTC is at best "experimental" because only if you see it as being "that" would explain why we rather hurt the network "to see what happens" instead of taking it serious. This is all turning into a massive joke.
@_date: 2015-07-16 01:49:13
Doesn't matter if that was the case (which it isn't) since the priv keys are generated on the fly when you sign and broadcast a transaction and we and our servers never see those. If you want read further into it on the blockstrap website.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:14:14
This is well known to those of us who have been around for a while. TX spam by those people, Bitmain preferably mining empty blocks (thus not doing the job they are meant to do for receiving block rewards) and on top of all, the largest miners not having activated SegWit.

Right that's why GH is "crowd mining" aka a community of miners that is actually mining with no rush to sell virtual hash power. If you would even take 20 min to do your diligence then you'd realize that 70% of the entire farm is owned by something like 20 people.
GH is an "actual" crypto community that doesn't just pretend to mine but actually mines, maintains nodes for BTC and altcoins, generates new coins, mints, builds on top of the BTC blockchain and a ton of other stuff.
So yeah, cloud mining might  be a scam, GH is not. end of story

so a decentralized wallet service that runs of your local storage where you're in control of your keys and freely tangible smart asset mining shares combined on a transparent cloud platform is not utilizing blockchain tech? You should read some into it via the forum first
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:45:08
depends on the implementation. GHcloud accounts only exist in the users LocalStorage so the web UI is only a HUB while the user account and the entire wallet hash are stored in the users SALT.
Thus you only sign your transactions via the UI while retaining control of your private keys. So no, it's not a web wallet in the traditional style.

This was so unnecessary CoinWallet. The proof that the block size needs to be increased (or block times reduced) has been provided already which prompted the battle between bitcoin XT and the core protocols.
Another spam attack in this case from a wallet provider / payment processor is irresponsible and you're hurting the eco-system for no apparent reason.
People should make a point that this wasn't appropriate and stop using CoinWallet.
@_date: 2015-09-11 11:43:13
It's not. The network was stress tested only weeks ago which prompted the bitcoin XT and BIP100 / BIP101 discussions. There was ZERO need to do this again, we already know what needs to be done. Now it's time to wake up the core developers and push them to increase the block size because we don't need bitcoin XT, the core protocol is working as intended, it just needs updating to support the growth. Something the core developers could do in a week.

Yes we have the blockchain and the coins only live on the chain, there is no such thing as lost coins only lost access.
However, if the owner of an address loses his private key he wont be able to access his address any more and there is no way to change this since it would me the network vulnerable to attacks.
