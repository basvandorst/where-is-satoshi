Oh totally. Have to have room to work with if you’re at that kind of leverage

Depends on how much equity they have. 20x is a lot and pretty risky regardless of how rich someone is.  Unless they’re scalping of course.

That’s margin trading for ya. Word of advice. Don’t margin trade. It’s very dangerous. You can easily liquidate you’re entire account on a large but quick swing against your bet. On the flip side it’s very difficult to profit on that trade if it goes your way. You’ll need cat like reflexes and nerves of steel. Whereas the other way around you’ll be automatically closed out.
Just don’t do it...
I guess unless your shorting 1:1.  But that’s not cool either because Bitcoin is amazing.

Ethereum smart contract would take care of this. The trusted third party would be the blockchain agreeing that the terms were met.

Smart contract that says "If 51% of this new GoTVote coin says the terms were met then release the funds. If 51% says they were not met release the funds back to HBO." Then you would need to create and distribute the coin. Create two accounts that would capture the coin one for yay and one for nay, the smart contract would read the balances of these accounts on a certain date and determine a winner. 
This is how proposed decentralized business and government agencies would work on Ethereum. You can manage this sort of thing through Aragon.

Just throwing a theory out there. I've spent to total of 5 minutes thinking about it. lol I'm sure there are issues

An actual bitcoin address. Classy

That's what I meant about the blockchain confirming it. 51% consensus. Unfortunately you may need to create and distribute a whole coin for voting that both parties fulfilled their end of the bargain.
This is how proposed decentralized businesses and government agencies could potentially work on Ethereum tokens.

People voting against reality would destroy what blockchain stands for. Agreement on the way things are done and accepting the consequences as a whole body. Create 100 coins and give them to 100 people that would be held accountable if they fudged the vote. Make their vote public so all could see who lied. 
There are ways. Seems pretty complicated for a TV show but some would disagree with me on that. GoT = Life

Seriously right? Real world application right there...

When do you think we’ll see people able to buy bitcoin with pretax money from their paychecks?

They sold generators that would “turn a profit” from leasing them out to customers. Those profits were faked, according to court documents, and paid for by future investors money. Some employees were leaving GPS’s in random spots making it look like they had more generators than they actually had. The key here is paying old investors back with new investors money. That’s definitely a Ponzi. That’s like. The definition of a Ponzi scheme. The stuff about the tax breaks were to help recoup the original cost of the  generators and sold as an added benefit I’m sure.

Risk = Reward
High Risk = High Reward
Having and maintaining a bitcoin wallet takes some knowledge and know how. If mishandled you could lose it all. The price could also decrease and never come back up. It could also go to $100,000. Who knows. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:47:13
Absolutely right. More demand, less supply. That’s why buying and holding causes the price to go up. 
Price is always the balance to supply vs demand.

Are you kidding me? Then could steal them. Just PM me the keys and I’ll verify the authenticity for everyone.
