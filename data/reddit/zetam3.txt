I have a question! So, if say everyone starts accepting Bitcoin..when they immediately cash it out, does that mean say that 1.5BTC you just spent just becomes "deleted" or does it get recycled into a new block? Which follow with..if everyone starts spending BTC if they disappear what incentive does a retailer have to accept them if the total supply starts to diminish? 
Next, besides say the traveling, making it easier to pay BTC in any country etc and all those benefits...What incentive is there for BTC to get new people in the game and turn fiat into BTC? As the diff rises it just becomes a mass elite game to harvest BTC's..you gotta get normal people into the game too right? 
Thanks for any info :)

Right or ethical? There is nothing unethical about their decision. Ethics have nothing to do with this. This is 100% purely a business decision. What does it being a public company have to with this decision? 
Wake the fuck up.

That's because Wolong and his gang and other whales are manipulating it on their way to the bank. You're an idiot if you think this currency isn't 100% manipulated

Are these new ones even worth looking into for newbies trying to mine some? Is it even worth it to begin with...

Now show me how many people actually have Bitcoins. I'd be willing to bet less then 500 of that 50,000 have any amount of BTC. What's the point of *getting into* it when mining cost are absurd? The only benefit I see is international commerce, trade, vacations, etc.

Can someone explain to me why everyone is so mad at Apple? Apple has every right to determine what and what does not work on their ecosystem. Its their product. You're purchasing that product and can sell it if you don't like it or return it. You are NOT forced to buy an apple product.

They have every right to do that. Read the ToS you agreed to.
Wake up.

Why would someone get into BTC when it takes a shit ton of money to even break even for a year.

Just because you "invest", doesn't mean the risk is zero and it's basically free money. Every investment has a risk, some less, some more. It's not like they just throw the money at a wall and it comes pouring back at them in a waterfall. Many rich people make their money back, but there are a lot who don't.

Uh...I don't think poor people in India could afford to mine for bitcoins.
