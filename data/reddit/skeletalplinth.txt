People who pay taxes do.

Sometimes, sure.  Sometimes, we have smart people working them.  Nature of any human system:  There are flaws.
BTC has problems too:  Sometimes morons spike up the price, sometimes it's smart people just investing.

Um, Britain started issuing notes in 1690 or so...

Because unless a nation accepts payment of taxes in BTC, then BTC will never be a currency.

Gold was accepted for payment of taxes during it's era of use a currency backing.  Same with salt, when it was used as currency during the Roman Empire.
Of course, we fixed the problem of random global events causing rapid changed in the value of our currency, by not backing it with gold.  Could you imagine if the USD was backed by BTC?

I think this applies to anyone playing the stock market.  Not just BTC investors.

Neat.  Sorta:


BTC will never stabilize, because of low numbers of people involved, and the fact that it's deflationary, which will cause people to hoard them, and any large sale will rapidly change the value of it.

Sorta.  Experts in manipulating financial regulations.
OIl speculation, first and foremost, started the bubble.  That caused more real estate speculation to occur, which then encouraged both "creative financing" options, and out-right collusion (Ie, banks getting ratings agencies to label mortgage backed securities as AAA rated, even though they were comprised of junk mortgages).
Many experts saw it happening, and spoke up.  I saw it happening, and called it during the peak of the oil boom.

Inflation isn't "theft", it's inbuilt inefficiency to an economy, and inefficiencies are what cause economies to grow.
If the production of all goods were 100% efficient, then we would be paying no more than the cost of production for all goods.  Nobody would turn a profit, and nobody would see a need to increase production to make a profit.
Greed is what drives economies.

Many of those $2/day workers also have a much lower cost of living than myself.
Living paycheck-to-paycheck is merely a matter of spending less than you earn.

You do realize, currently, BTC mining comprises nearly 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions, and will only rise?

I can technically buy things with my mortgage note, too.  I can buy things with crack, too.  However, it's difficult, and expensive to do so.  Much like BTC:  It's difficult, and expensive.  Which is why we have escrow services, and exchanges.

There is planning for the future:  Create and maintain economic levers TODAY so they can be used in the FUTURE during recessionary periods, to reduce boom/bust cycles as much as possible.

If it's a currency, it sucks at it's job...
"You had one job!"

Those notes were promises by banks to provide a specific amount of physical pound sterling.  Nothing more.
