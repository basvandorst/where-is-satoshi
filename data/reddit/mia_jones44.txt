As for me, it's very cool that we have the opportunity to do such things in blockchain. I would even say that this is one of the great advantages of the blockchain  to rest how the transaction would work before taking it live. What do you think?

I have heard several times that you don't have to tell how many tokens you have. In general, this is very logical. We don't tell everyone about our capital and tokens are one of our capital types. So, don't tell anyone about your Bitcoins!)

This scheme is called market laws. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular every day that leads to an increase in its value among the population. And this value leads to such price growth.

I agree with your point of view. Everyone has to decide what to do with his or her Bitcoin but I also think that some of them should be kept for the future. And then, you will be pleasantly surprised when you see your profit.

When you look at such a chart, you understand how bad it is that the state can not control the cryptocurrency. Bicoin needs regulation! What do you think?

Maybe you're right and it was illegal but it was. And I think that if banks have to do such decisions today, the situation would repeat. Don't you think so?

It sounds like good advice! However, there is one problem. Bitcoin is much more expensive now than half a year ago so buying it is not so simple for ordinary people)) I understand that for a good profit you need to have a lot of tokens and for this you have to invest a lot. What do you think?

Many people say that Bitcoin is very reliable. In addition, Bitcoin is more expensive than gold. Would not you like to take a chance and invest in this cryptocurrency?

This is a very sad story and I compassionate you in this situation. However, now you can make conclusions for the future. In this case, you will know that in investing it is better to listen to your own intuition than to someone else's advice.

I thought of the Altcoins earlier. Their main advantage is that they are cheaper for investors. However, on the other hand, they are not able to give such a great profit as Bitcoin. I understand that, so it's quite difficult for me to make a decision.

I can say that speculators will always exist. We have to get used to them. However, I'm agree with you that Bitcoin is able to regulate the profit of speculators and smart beginners. This is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is so popular now.

I can say that the auto provided good tips, however, for me, your way of trading crypto is closer. The only thing I do in another way is  that I don't wait for certain 5 years because sometimes you can sell it much later.

I have the same situation)) I am glad for those people who have invested in Bitcoin in time and I'm sad that I didn't do it.

I'm already waiting for 200,000 dollars. If you look at how fast Bitcoin grows in price, than it will be soon.
