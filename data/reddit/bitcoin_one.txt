Bitcoin.one intends to replace bitcoin.org, bitcointalk and this forum with the best forum and reference platform you've ever seen. Any authority on that platform will be based on reputation and respect, which has to be earned, and can be lost. Unfortunately we'll need a couple more months to complete, but it will be ready on the Big Day.

Its absolutely incredible that it has been groundhog day for two and a half years already. I really wish i could move the clock forward half a year, when this hilarious discussion is hopefully over and larger blocksize is a fact.

Certainly. It will take a few months still before release but it will be ready before the Big Day.

no, the guy with the beer cup hat (who also happens to be an experienced engineer) says: hey guys, take it off the handbrake! the handbrake is only for parking, you should not use it while driving! it was not designed to be used while driving. just slooowly lift it.

[bitcoin.one]( as a replacement for this sub and bitcoin.org

there is no consensus on the consensus model

You make that common mistake (or perhaps deliberate false argument) many people make in this debate: confusing max capacity with actually used capacity.
In the [same source]( where you probably found that 56k number you'll find that the average *used* capacity is around 2,000.
So please adjust your napkin math and divide everything by 28 right there. Let's also assume that this level will not be reached within 5 years from now, when you can pick up a 40Tb drive for 280 dollar, the same price as an 8TB drive today.
So, yes, bitcoin can easily reach VISA scale using on-chain transactions, while still being decentralized.

Again, I don't see any reason why not. This is the premise of a lot of debate here, and that premise is false. As long as that temporary cap on the blocksize is lifted, it can scale, and it will scale.

The common requirement that all parties have is this coin, and to be able to receive and transfer that coin to any wallet. The "tools" you are probably thinking about don't facilitate that, and for that reason, most likely will fail. IF there is no technical requirement for it. My point is: there isn't. Apart from the artificial blocksize limit.

I have yet to read a single piece of mike that I can't fully agree with. And i don't think certain hearts can be won, not with any argument, not in any tone of voice.
I am starting to get more and more suspicious about why not, but what I know for sure is that if bitcoin really is a threat to the banking establishment, anything is to be expected. Preventing the implementation of a feature that will allow it to scale is the best possible tactic I can think of.

"a lot" wrong even? Interesting. It should not be too difficult for you then to name just a few?
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:38:39
to calculate the amount of harddisk space needed, as you did on your napkin, you need to use the average capacity, NOT the peak. why is this so hard??
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:04:15
Sure you can be a peer. Peers in the network have a varying requirement of confidence. That requirement and the costs to fullfill it has to be competitive to other solutions, to keep working and be succesfull. If you run a bitcoin bank you have to make more expenses than someone getting paid for a coffee. Both levels of trust will require just a fraction of the costs of legacy payment networks, even if bitcoin becomes highly successfull.

if this dead horse can be removed from the track, visa will be gone in 30 years and bitcoin will have taken over its place.  most people in this forum don't seem to like that.

you always see an opportunity to sneak some smug in your posts...

Emtpy parotted claim. There is no technical reason why this is not possible. "Ooh but the blockchain is going to be so biiiig!". Yes. Just like the Web is a trillion times bigger than in 1995, when I put my first site on it.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:44:49
On the contrary. Most bitcoiners are using goverment approved node operators for their transactions.
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:47:46
And bitcoin is one of them.

You may find the original [bitcoin whitepaper]( an interesting read. It proposes to create exactly that.
It even says so in the title: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
I don't see any reason why what is described in that paper can not work. However, there are a lot of people that do not **want** it to work, for obvious reasons.

No, appeal to math

exept payment channels are so complex Joe Consumer would not be able to actually verify wether he was dealing with a payment service that's connected via payment channels to bitcoin or not (if he would even care at all), so he'd be better off choosing a service from an established legal entity and a clear English contract (also known as "bank").

From the first paragraph: "A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going  through   a financial institution". The POW is explained further on.
