No matter how much wealth and social stability a nation has, if people decide they don't want to use that nations currency, the currency is worthless. People ultimately hold the power to decide which unit of account with which to transact and store their value.

Circle lets me buy up to $300 instantly with bank or credit card. I'm not sure how long you have to be registered before theyll let you do that though. 
You might be able to find someone to send you bitcoin for paypal funds, but make sure its someone with a good reputation! Most people won't do it because of the risk that you could reverse the paypal payment.

Probably has something to do with the fact they're heavily invested in dollar denominated assets, or otherwise think that they've missed the bitcoin rocketship to the moon and therefore want to see it crash and burn...

Actually, there seems to be quite alot of physical Euros floating around inside Greece in the private sector. Smart people there have been avoiding banks for a while now.

Actually, it can increase indefinitely, as long as the increase is in line with the yearly increase in availability of bandwidth for the general public.

How much of the economy does the financial sector consist of in the US? Something like 20% I believe. Sounds like it takes alot more than one server to accomplish all the things that could be done with bitcoin instead.

BoA, JPM, etc, are the primary shareholders (owners) of the Federal Reserve, who in turn control our fiat. So yes...their behavior is linked to and is a reflection of fiat itself.
