If bcash is illiquid then tipping small amounts would tend to obscure this since there is nothing to spend it on anyway.
@_date: 2019-03-05 07:22:41
Even if LN fails, this does not mean that bcash is the correct approach -- bch is a simplistic solution to a complex problem that will fail (if this is not already evident based on price and hashrate, it is ironically the limited usage of bch that makes it appear to be successful to those who wish to see this). BTC can do things other than LN in the future to address scaling.
Having said this, LN does look like a success or at least is  in the process of succeeding .5% growth \*daily\* or more in every important metric afaict. Needless to say .5% daily growth, if sustained over years, is incredible.
The very fact that many developers are willing to contribute to a project like LN is to me a strong indication of the support that BTC has.

"not privy" means "they do not know" or "the information is not provided to them" -- "not bound" is what you are trying for.
why anyone would take advice from someone who does not understand this term but uses it anyway is beyond me.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:27:15
no, i am saying that their attacks on BTC reflect a ridiculously inflated opinion of where bcash fits in and the only reasonable explanation as to why they discuss BTC all the time is an attempt to persuade that bch is actually the real bitcoin -- a more reasonable approach for them would be to discuss binance or stellar to, to fight for position against another crypto that threatens to overtake it.

Okay, thanks.

I agree in principle with what you say, and even a dumb person can be right about something that a smart person is wrong about.
But my money is on the smart person being right and I think it proper that a person who can't figure out how to edit a Wikipedia article (which I am pretty sure, based on some reverted edits, can be done by a 9 year old) keep his mouth shut about how development on Bitcoin should proceed.
I have been foolish enough in the past to open my own mouth about something I was, in the company I was keeping, woefully unqualified to express an opinion and the reaction of those assembled taught me the value of silence in a way I have never forgotten.

Another story is the Twilight Zone where gold turns out to be worthless (in the desert, one guy kills the other guy over water and dies thinking his gold will make him rich). 
Yet another (kind of) is Treasure of the Sierra Madre where the bandits throw away all the gold dust the three miners have accumulated. 
We all know/fear that the things we strive for all of our lives may turn out to be worthless (or lost instantly) when we look back and here in VZ is a real example. I guess today few people accumulate money there but prior to the hyperinflation there must have been literally millions of people who thought they were safe who were wiped out in months or less.

Although this sounds like a simplistic argument in favor of Bitcoin, it is actually profound.
Try to explain to 99.9% of the World that there are coins \*besides\* Bitcoin.
See what happens once someone you sold bcash to finds out it is not actually Bitcoin -- if they know where you live, you might literally need to move away.

Are economists known often as successful investors? Serious question.
@_date: 2019-03-15 23:39:27
I wonder about this also. As I have said before, they are relying on confusion with BTC to succeed; if they were their own crypto, they would avoid this confusion.
They would also be worried about (and I think they are although they don't post about it) falling a notch down on the list of cryptos -- a 10% move in the one of the two cryptos below them will make them lose position and I think in terms of being seen by funds that invest in crypto as something they are allowed to investment in, being in the top 5 or top 10 position is important.
The central idea is, moves in BTC are probably less likely to be the result of manipulation whereas far less money can be used to move the price of bcash. Indeed, I think today's move might be defensive against the two cryptos near it in value -- I doubt if they have a chance to move up to overtake litecoin or eos so they are just worried about slipping.

Is it realistic to expect there to in fact be lots of independent nodes? 
@_date: 2019-03-04 07:54:03
I too believe that nodes with a long tenure and proving themselves to be trustworthy will become valuable properties, possibly something that can be sold like domain names (but I do not mean the names of the nodes -- not actually sure what would be transferred in the case of a sale).
It seems very intuitive to me that getting in early is a good idea; but it it \*still\* early -- the network could be 100 times larger eventually. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:12:19
My honest concern is someone paying BTC price for BCH and then finding out they have been scammed. I would be surprised if this has not happened (perhaps many times) and bcash people are helping to cause this confusion.
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:11:57
Does that imply essentially that the smaller the block size the better?
Also, if block size is smaller, does that not mean more blocks so the size of the DB is about the same? Either more smaller blocks or fewer larger blocks?

Would people/businesses who actively trade or accept as payment BTC be candidates for running their own node?
@_date: 2019-03-31 14:47:38
I would really like an approximate idea how much has been and is being spent to support the price of bcash. It seems pretty clear to me that while they badmouth LN and BTC in general, they are currently primarily concerned about dropping below Binance coin -- not sure if top 5 by market cap is important (like some funds restrict investment on that basis) but if it is, they also would like to beat Litecoin although that looks pretty hard.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:01:19
I think each time another crypto reaches a higher marketcap  it becomes significantly harder for things like investment funds or even individual investors to consider putting money into it.
I could see an investment fund be constrained to invest only in certain type of assets and one criteria for crypto might be, say, that they are in the top 5 by marketcap (which sounds plausible to me); if that is true, we might see a desperate, back-and-forth battle between binance and bcash as well as some other similarly valued cryptos.
@_date: 2019-03-12 05:17:30
that looks post-apocalyptic. there was a scene sort of like this in I am Legend and also in one of the War of the Worlds films -- wads of money that end up blowing in the wind or something.
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:19:00
But my serious concern is someone getting ripped off and I am wondering if there are many stories about this happening. Even my smart but non-technical friends (who bought BTC a few years ago) have very little idea about what is going on in this space. I could not imagine trying to explain to them that they actually own bcash and bsv or how they could sell these coins or what the difference among the coins is.
I could also see how the simplistic "bigger is better" is actually easier to explain than the reasons not to do have bigger blocks. This actually is not that critical -- what is far more important is no one is buying something they don't want, especially for a bad price, because they are being deliberately misled.

I love chess and hope this catches on -- two variants that are big on [Chess.com]( are bughouse and crazyhouse, consider those, especially that former which is I think a good combination of gambling and skill -- even weak players occasionally beat world class players at bughouse and wagering would be a huge addition to the game. But if poker were available on lightning, that would be \*HUGE\*.
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:04:29
I have been watching these quite closely also. Unclear which is most important. Maybe nodes and capacity in BTC are important but maybe channels are an overall indication of activity and precede new nodes and additional BTC. Anyway, the rate has steadily been between .5% and 1% for almost every metric \*every day\* -- this means, for example, that the total number of BTC by the end of the year could easily be 5000.

I sort of thought I was clear: a company wants to send money to overseas divisions, pay foreign employees, etc. So this network handles taxable events and the company is interested in being able to represent that every transaction is legal also. So they deliberately limit users to their vendors, employees, subsidiaries, etc. -- can you explain why that doe not make sense?
If it does not, please explain how a company would create a bunch of nodes used for important business and yet by keeping this network open, risk some illegal transfers being routed over company nodes.
To be honest, that seems pretty clear to me but maybe i am misunderstanding some technical issue. Please explain.
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:49:29
Okay but if they are not planning within this network to connect to anyone except other employees or divisions of the company, why not make your own dedicated LN -- what does one gain by making it part of a larger LN? Maybe one does gain something -- please explain what that might be.

@_date: 2019-02-07 07:40:06
i wonder if as the price per bcash coin goes down it becomes cheaper to prop it up; i could see that being the case but i can also see the holders being prompted into to selling increasingly larger volumes which will counterbalance the lower price to make propping continue to be about as expensive.
i am genuinely concerned for people who bought when the price was nearer to parity with BTC or at least was significant enough to confuse people: even as I type this I realize something that might be very important:
**As the price drops and the difference in price between BTC and BCH becomes more obvious, fewer people will be confused: if they have even casual knowledge of BTC they realize there is something fishy about buying "bitcoin" for 2 percent of what he knows the current price is.**

It may not be so straightforward to maintain nodes or a collection of nodes so that they are up consistently -- technically-capable organizations may end up eventually being major players in LN.

I also don't think rich are the problem except for things like owning vast amounts of land or resources that are made unavailable to the public.

@_date: 2019-02-09 19:11:34
why would this happen 20k times in a day?
Again, is the number of channel updates literally in no way a reflection of overall activity? If no one transmitted payments using LN could the channel update number be 20k? Conversely, if there were many payments made in a day, could the channel update number be 0?
@_date: 2019-02-09 18:00:44
but when a transaction occurs, does a channel balance not change?
@_date: 2019-02-22 04:26:38
well, i am suggesting that maybe for performance or security reasons or legal/tax reasons a company or other large multinational entity might want a dedicated network. why doesn't that make sense? i just thought about this today but it seems like a fairly compelling use case for LN. companies have their own closed networks, why not a closed but transnational LN for transmitting company funds?
your argument that limiting connections to other nodes (when you use term capacity i don't think you mean bandwidth or total number of BTC held but rather functionality, right?) does not make sense seems could be applied to any internal network -- obviously companies want to limit access to internal networks sometimes.
please reply if you can expand on your first answer.
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:26:34
There is no way for everyone to be rich as long as there are tasks to be done that are so unpleasant that people are forced to do them by poverty and lack of skills -- society seems set up to provide people to bus tables/wash dishes or clean motel rooms. It will only be when robots are available to do those tasks that everyone can be at least comfortable (rich by the standards of, say, 70 years ago). But before that time, you can raise minimum wage to 100 bucks an hour, it won't matter -- rents and other prices will simply go up. Technology has always helped society and we may see robotics and AI be the final step which frees people from inter-generational poverty. As I indicated, managing such a society will be tricky -- large numbers of idle people, the people who used to do jobs that have been automated, is something that has to be dealt with. I am still in favor of new technology but it is not a panacea without good planning. (Seems like Idiocracy sort of explored this idea, including what happens when automation does not work very well or starts to break down.)

@_date: 2019-02-01 15:18:04
well, it sounds like it simply makes using BTC cheaper for whatever biz uses it and that such a biz expects to make its money from the business itself; but running lightning nodes on behalf of other businesses sounds like what will happen (or is already) and maybe there is profit in that?
@_date: 2019-02-17 08:46:48
I actually think that the spectacular failure of BCH will eliminate a lot of deliberate confusion. I would like to see r/btc become a ghost town and [bitcoin.com]( end up in the hands of a more responsible party; [bitcoin.com]( i suspect has some real impact and i bet RV would not sell it for less than (at this point) many tens of millions -- i am not sure but it has to be one of the most valuable domain names. Eventually he may \*have\* to sell it to raise money and when, say, 10 million starts looking good to him, you can expect not to hear much in the future from him.

Yeah, the hyperinflation is a symptom, not the problem.
However, if anyone there had purchased BTC, gold, dollars, yen, whatever, they would be doing well.
I did not read the article but if it suggests that VZ mine BTC to take advantage of cheap power, I see no reason why the government would prevent something that would bring in foreign exchange and they should certainly allow citizens to do this. I think they in fact do try to prevent BTC's use and not sure what they hope to accomplish by doing so.
@_date: 2019-02-22 07:24:42
Well, an important question is, do you see a company deciding to implement such a thing for their own use? If so, this would end up to be a big win for LN. And "neutered" is sometimes desirable; indeed, neutering pets is something people often want done. As for taxes, if the corporate owner of this proprietary/private LN was audited and wanted to show the government all the transactions, they might indeed want to turn off the onion routing for this purpose.

channel balance changes must be proportional to transactions roughly, no? i am guessing that the same payment might result in multiple channel balance changes as the payment is routed?
no matter what, a growing number of channel updates should have something to do with overall activity also growing.
@_date: 2019-02-25 02:54:05

@_date: 2019-02-24 18:10:19

@_date: 2019-02-21 08:52:32
i would guess that the open routing nodes tend to hold more BTC than non-routing nodes and also tend to have more channels. if this is so, what is visible probably swamps the hidden stuff.
is it true that the number of channels that we know about is affected by Eclair and mobile wallets even if such nodes do not directly make up this metric by reporting or however the metrics are gathered?
@_date: 2019-02-09 19:28:14
in the spec i do not see a definition for the term "channel update" although it could plausibly mean: 1. Opening/Closing a channel  2. Using a channel to transmit funds -- You are saying it is updating the fees -- not seeing this in the spec.
@_date: 2019-02-09 19:24:58
what is the purpose of publishing channel updates? the other metrics, number of nodes, capacity, etc. all seem significant.
let me ask it this way: is channel updates in any way a reflection of activity of LN?
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:12:38
by today's standards, everyone could be rich with robotics just as by the standards of, say, 150 years ago, most people today are extremely wealthy -- only a homeless person today in the US is poor by the standards of 1870; a working-class person today is in every important way fabulously wealthy by 1870s standards when, i would point out, even a rich person had to use gaslights and had no tv, no fruit out of season, etc.
@_date: 2019-02-20 00:28:33
Based on current growth rates of various metrics almost all of which are between .5 and 1% \*\*per day\*\* it seems easily possible that you may be routing 10 times that much in a year's time but of course 1% per day compounded is some amazing figure (much more than 10) so maybe you will see 100 times which would be some real money except maybe as network grows competition to route also grows?
EDIT: at 1% per day (hard to imagine that such a rate continues) you see 37 times the amount of BTC; at .5% per day it is 6 times. That is in a single year. Over say 10 years, it is hard to imagine just how large the network would be even at significantly lower growth rates. I am guessing something like 300k BTC within two years, about one billion dollars worth. That would make LN a huge, huge success. --  it is not some new crypto with an artificially-maintained price but a metric that comes from many different people choosing to commit funds to it.

I think it is very complex. We had the gold standard for centuries and long before the standard was dropped, the limitations were felt.
The idea that money steadily declines in value is simplistic. You can't compare the immensely superior goods and services of today with those of a century ago and some things cost less today in unadjusted dollars then 100 years ago: phone calls is one major example. Some foods also.
I believe that rapid innovation: telegraph and railroads which caused wealth to be created faster than gold could be physically transferred that really highlighted the gold standard's limitations. But I wonder if without this problem: the need to ship and store/protect heavy gold but instead using crypto, you can have money that does not work like either fiat or gold. I honestly don't know but I am certain that this difference between crypto and gold is very, very significant.
@_date: 2019-02-09 20:42:55
okay, so it seems to be that if 20k times a day an owner sets fees this indicates in a general sort of way how active the entire network is.
maybe a more important metric is the number of new channels per day?
@_date: 2019-02-09 16:23:18
if channel updates correspond to transactions, there are about 20k a day, growing about 5% per week. A non-trivial fraction of all transactions and maybe by the end of the year a pretty big part of them.
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:46:57
i am wondering just how much it is costing them to prop up bcash. both bch and bsv experience spikes in price that look to me like they are being bought suddenly to make sure the crypto does not drop down a notch in the list -- both hover only slightly above the coin right below them.
i do not know how to estimate the expense of this apparent market manipulation. i am sure the cost of paying spammers is trivial compared to this, however.

I am not sure but I believe holding things like foreign currency is not legal (as it would tend to undermine the already hyperinflated local currency) and I would bet that if such currency or gold is not subject to confiscation by the authorities it certainly makes one a target for robbers.

I sure would not hold entrepreneurs trying to make money from BTC against them; it's the exact way BTC will increase in usage.

why do u think that? It seems to me that if in the chain of addresses one is known as having belonged to a casino, etc. that will not ever disappear. now, the receiver of such coins may be totally uninvolved with that but that does not mean that he will not have to prove this. i am struck by what has happened apparently many times in the past 10 years to people caught by cops with large amounts of money -- the burden has been on them to prove it had nothing to do with drugs and at least sometimes, that money ends up being completely forfeited, sometimes destroying the lives of the people from whom it was taken.

i was not able to sit through Fight Club. my argument comes from experience. i was once sort of snooty, for no good reason, since whatever i had at the time came from my father's efforts, not my own. then i got out into the world and saw demonstrably smart people who had "menial" jobs, mailman turned out to be a common one.
someone once said to me, people who work with their hands are often not intelligent. i thought, hands are what distinguishes humans from other animals. i mean, i know what he meant: manual labor is for dumb people.
not only is that wrong based on the idea that an undemanding job leaves time for thinking but also: why would, say, a black smith be dumb? i would guess that was a really demanding job mentally: in a time when most people did not finish high school, the village smith had to know something about chemistry and physics (not that he would have called it that) in order to practice his craft successfully. there is a company retraining coal miners to write software and it is working -- mining is a job that requires some smarts also, although it is pretty demanding physically too.

One of the big things the nazis did to Jews was economic. (Even Holocaust deniers would be hard-pressed to also deny that these policies were implemented -- the nazis made zero secret of this.)
The nazis by 1939 made it virtually impossible for Jews to make a living within Germany and pauperized Jews (by stealing assets and businesses) which made immigration very, very difficult since few countries were willing to absorb people who would become charity cases. In effect, this was slow murder (a large number of Jews, not surprisingly, committed suicide) and had the explicitly genocidal policies not been implemented many Jews would have starved to death or died from disease and exposure anyway.
Assets like crypto would have made the nazi task much harder -- indeed, they might have reconsidered the whole idea since part of the expulsion was the profits that could be made by confiscating Jewish wealth.
Maybe this is simplistic; maybe they Jews still would have been in trouble but the idea of having an asset that I could access anywhere I went without anyone knowing I had it would be very comforting.
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:43:54
In terms of number of people affected, I am sure the percentage of suicides was far less than 1%.
However, the effect of being reduced to poverty is much higher mortality from starvation and disease in any case -- to argue: "Look, the nazis did not mean to kill Jews; they only meant to deprive them of their livelihoods and assets" is absurd. Some of the people affected by nazi policies were in their 90s and that did not protect them from being forced from their, in some cases, hospital beds.
The ultimate aim of nazis was not merely resettlement -- they knew the practical effect of their policies would be destruction.

Dollars to donuts (now there's an old-fashioned cliche -- last time I bought a donut in SF it was 4.50 and I am sure everywhere they are over a buck each, right?) nobody is getting killed over this. But they might need a more hospitable place. Having said that, I sure they chose the spot based on climate and other ocean conditions.
Seems like, just as the seasteader said, this might be pretty good for Thailand anyway. I would love to check out a place like this, after they get a nice hotel there.

I certainly have references; whether you will believe the authors is another matter.
Kind of like this: How dare you even risk calling something an "embellishment" without a solid reason for doing so.
Not sure, but you sound like borderline asshole -- maybe learning about history will help you, maybe it won't.

I hope he would not call it Bcash... what if he got Ver on the phone?
All kidding aside, this will be the least successful scam ever; they are going after fairly sophisticated people on average, no little old ladies whom you can convince to withdraw money and hand it to a guy in a suit standing outside the bank so he can count it to see if the teller was honest and redeposit it.

not sure rebase is required -- simply consolidating all local commits so that they don't show up in main repo -- is rebase required to do this?

I cannot see how people will run nodes just to make Bitcoin work better, not for years at a time if it costs them money.
@_date: 2019-01-29 17:09:36
sure. everyone knows that.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:35:57
1. Again, domain names is just an example but come to think of it, would not naming nodes the same be confusing so that node names might end up being unique? 2. Can't nodes behave in better or worse fashion? I understand that you can't lose money to a bad actor but perhaps transactions can be delayed so a node with a long history of being up, etc. might be a valuable property?
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:21:35
you *sound* like one. looking at your posts, sounds like actually you are involved with LN. 
what is the point in running a node if it is not profitable now and you don't anticipate it being profitable ever?
if that is really true, the LN is doomed to fail. i would guess either fees will go up or, as i asked implicit, whether LN will develop into something unanticipated by most.
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:45:18
i also long before BCH. the simple counter argument is that if BCH succeeded then why not clone it, etc.? There has to be something special about a crypto that has existed for ten years -- if you have to pick one to succeed that will be the one. And frankly, I don't see there being more than one or possibly two cryptos in another decade; LN and LN-like systems that use BTC as the underlying value and add functionality in a second layer is exactly how I see things playing out.

The Zone where
1. Thieves put themselves into suspended animation in a desert cave after robbing a gold repository
2. They awaken; one is dead because a rock broke the \*glass\* of his capsule
3. One greedy guy kills a couple of the others and destroys their truck so two of them have to hoof into town
4. It is frigging hot and one of the two had forgotten his water so the other sells gulps for bars of gold until the forgetful one (the scientist who invented the process) bludgeons him to death
5. A couple in a futuristic car find the dying scientist who offers them gold for water before dying. The woman says, "Gold --  didn't they used to use that as money?"
One of the dumbest Zones ever -- typical TZ casual science fiction wonder, suspended animation, worth billions but instead the scientist robs a bank.

I am not asking if btc is for me -- as i said, i believe that LN is going to be a big deal but I know 100% that a huge network will not survive just on the enthusiasm of hobbyists but God bless them; I doubt if the people who developed the LN think that is why it will continue to grow either.
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:26:33
Firstly, maybe incoming channels is important? And a long history with other nodes establishes trust? Secondly, how can you say that there is not much benefit? I also heard this said about domain names. (And I am not saying that node names are equivalent to domain names; that is just an example of something that people underestimated drastically.)
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:31:12
what gets me is that a good samaritan informed them of the dangerous bug last year. at first i thought, maybe a big crash in bch due to software issues would make people doubt btc so it was a good thing; now i think he should have kept it quiet to demonstrate the quality of people involved and let the inevitable, which I believe we are now seeing, happen.
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:12:03
i do believe that is possible but it is also possible that someone of limited understanding who owns a bunch of BTC and thus would own a bunch of BCH would think that simply by making blocks bigger scaling would be dealt with. This is perfect example of *simplistic* reasoning but it does not mean that Ver or some of those who are involved with BCH do not actually believe in this as a technical solution; that BCH is worth just above 3 percent of BTC and trades about 4 percent of the volume of BTC is a strong indication that this was the wrong idea; but what really convinced me is my gut feeling, based on listening to the developers for the respective projects, which group had the best quality developers -- I trust my gut on this having been around some top software guys over the years.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:00:50
i am asking for a reasoned argument. you are fixated on node names.
historically i can think of no business opportunity that being early did not provide a significant advantage in; if somehow LN is an exception, that is pretty surprising.
if you have no ideas, that is fine. i think your position is really clear now.
@_date: 2019-01-31 19:23:48
I think LN is going to be, based on recent growth, a big deal. But if there is no way to make money from it, I can think of nothing that will make it succeed in the long run.
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:59:54
I am afraid so. Even if Ver is completely sincere in his belief and not motivated by self-interest at the expense of others, he is simply not technically qualified to understand the complex issues that arise when attempting to address scaling. I am a software developer who has spent pretty serious time studying Bitcoin for job interviews and other reasons, reading white paper and wiki pages and I have to say that it is far over my head -- a non-developer, non-mathematician (maybe a mathematician who was not a developer would have a shot) has no way of following the arguments. And importantly, the bug that his people had to be told about by a well-intentioned and extremely competent developer who did not work on the BCH fork is an indication of the quality of technical advice Ver is getting.
@_date: 2019-01-29 12:59:10
are you kidding? he is not (afiak) remotely qualified and given the bug that was uncovered last year in bch, he is not being advised by qualified people. i would guess not 1 in 100 senior developers is at the level where they could successfully make major modifications to bitcoin protocol and understand the consequences or even know how to test thoroughly the changes. I freely admit not only am I not at that level now but probably could not reach that level; on the other hand, I think having worked with architects at major companies, I think I can reasonably judge whether someone else is approaching that level. Roger Ver never even claimed that he can write code -- why he thinks he knows what is best for bitcoin is baffling but I think he really thinks he does.

I mentioned this in the lightning subreddit: the number of channel updates per 24h has steadily been increasing and I think that is an important metric. 11k was normal at the beginning of the month iirc; today i saw it go over 18k.

What do you see happening to LN in terms of functionality?
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:59:11
sure but it would be hard to build up the network. that is the barrier to entry.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:36:19
I disagree: if a node could represent that it is certified, assuming that a deliberate bad actor could cause problems (could a malicious node cause problems? better of course if not but i suspect someone willing to lose money could damage the network, at least up to the amount they were willing to lose -- would be interested in thoughts on this) then being certified would be valuable.
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:08:44
I believe there is some characteristic of bitcoin that makes it the required underlying crypto -- i could of course be wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:56:22
Is that really true? Could not a very early node with many channels become  a valuable asset? Why are node names not valuable in themselves?
I am also suggesting that there may be more to being part of LN than just routing payments. Maybe you could deliver content?
@_date: 2018-12-30 15:16:46
you don't see some potential in a bunch of nodes which interact with each other doing something other than exchanging funds?
@_date: 2019-05-03 08:06:22
It is certainly true that people get over-extended and banking exists to make money. They "enslave" those people who allow themselves to be enslaved.
Before banking, there was wage slavery where people worked 6 or 7 days a week and never saved money. Because of technology, people today (at least in developed nations) live much better and healthier lives.
Banking is something that exists because it is necessary for some and for others allows them to do things they probably should not do. Calling debt "slavery" is propaganda/simplistic. If you want to tell people not to buy things on time, that is fine but abolition of banking is absurd. And Bitcoin won't change people borrowing -- all it will do is make it possible to transact without banks, which will certainly be useful to many people.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:22:42
if node names can indeed be used to mislead, does this not imply strongly the need for a registry/certification agency?
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:31:18
I'll let others argue against this but my first thought is, what does "safeish" mean especially when, as I understand it, payments are passed along the network.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:01:33
can you have different crypto in the same lightning network?
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:56:36
