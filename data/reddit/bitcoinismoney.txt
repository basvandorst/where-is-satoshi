The truth is those values are no longer upheld due to a twisted ideology of thinking the government can solve all problems.  There is correlation there you know, between those values not being upheld, and why America is no longer working.  Everyone who knows anything about history knows communism and socialism always fail horrifically resulting in the deaths of 100s of millions of people.

Not sure they have much reputation yet, because I think they only started accepting Bitcoin 2 or 3 months ago.  Interesting though that when you make a purchase they require you to put in a Bitcoin address to receive any refunds in case a refund is required.  I think they use Bitnet rather than Bitpay.

Always wondered the same why they would name thesmelves that. Basically they are admitting they are trying to overthrow capitalism. Very creepy, yet I bet their audience has no clue.

Do you mean Bitnet or Rakuten uses PGP?  Either way I am digging that.

America was the greatest most prosperous, wealthy country that ever existed.  America's capitalist system ushered in the industrial and technological revolution.  America had the most inventions, the most innovations.  America is turning into a shithole today because of communists infiltrating the government.  Government is getting bigger and bigger, now we have communist bailouts like in the 2008 crisis.  You seem to think banker bailouts are capitalism, so maybe you should rethink it.

Well at least you realize things are corrupted.  But you are missing the reason for the problems, and you are being led to a false solution.  A big part of the problem is as things get worse people beg for even more government, which exacerbates the problems.  The way it works is big corporations buy off the government and write the regulations for themselves and to block their competition.  Then monopolies get in charge of government.  As the government gets bigger and more powerful, and as people give the government the power of socialism it makes the government an even better prize for the elites.  They want socialism and big government, because it helps them secure their monopolies when they buy off that government.  Socialism will never work, because as long as you have the government giving out money, the elite will buy off the government and write laws that make them recipients of that money.  The best thing we can do is reduce government as much as possible and chain government down with the constitution.  We need to uphold the values of freedom and capitalism and we will see prosperity again in the USA.

They don't need Bitcoin, they are funded by Al Gore and other propagandists.

Ah, an [anti-capitalist](  I guess you are a communist government lover, that explains it.

Also it seems they interface with hundreds of other stores.  So its not rakuten that does the shipping most of the time, but a store that they are interfacing with.  Each store has a user rating based on positive and negative feedback.
