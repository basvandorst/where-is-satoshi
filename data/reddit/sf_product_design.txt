He was saying the exact same thing 5 years ago.

what's that saying again? if everyone's a douchebag except you, you're probably the douchebag?

which many people can't do for a lot of financial reasons. also, there is no guarantee that previous ATHs will ever be broken again.
again, it is a risky investment and there is no way you can say otherwise with a straight face.

.....you kidding? How hard is it to understand? Buying something cheaper than ATH means you have always made money at ATH.

I'm a "more-coins-than-most"er and i hate this kind of shit-post moonboy silliness.
It's posted to trick people into buying into a pyramid scheme while it's blowing up.

ew gross. who needs that infantile shit around here?

It has the reputation of being a risky investment because it is one.
What this completely simplistic chart fails to capture is how long bitcoin can remain below previous highs and how long one has to wait to be in the black. 
It doesn't capture bitcoin's volatility, nor does it capture how short a time all these people will be in the black if they don't sell in the short window where it is profitable.

i've never heard someone who knows what they're talking about say "in the green"
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:47:27
lol right? you know we're in a bubble when you see shitposts like this that whitewash all the shittiness of the last few years and pretend everything is totally fine in order to hype bitcoin and dupe more people into buying *weeks after the start of a huge bull market*

I want to send this to someone, but....
......it's too accurate.

1) that sounds fucking scary and asinine. no secrets? secrets are, generally, a very good thing. i bet there are lots of things you'd prefer the world not to know about yourself.
2) i can understand the desire to have a 100% transparent government but....is that really a good idea?
just a thought experiment my good friend asked me once when i said something similar.
what if the government had discovered a method of making a nuclear weapon out of a microwave and a sticky of juicy fruit gum.
is that a secret worth keeping?
