You're right and like I said, I used the wrong term.  It's irrelevant given that the behavior works in a way that their documentation says it shouldn't. 
I started a thread: 
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:27:06
There aren't supposed to be any fees for the first 60 days and as best I can tell, there aren't.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:51:03
I probably used the wrong term.  The fact is that you can sell x amount of bitcoin on the exchange and set a price per bitcoin.  There are no other factors you can set and there is nothing indicating that they can or will sell it for less than you listed it at.  It doesn't say sell x amount at **around** y price.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:26:42
Seems a lot like those ads that get you to show up for one thing but they pitch another.  Like, you could have to endure a long amway sales pitch before they ever get to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:10:46
You can do this on their new exchange.

Someone is lying and it is not me.  Logs can be manipulated and bugs happen.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:57:05
Michael,  per my last email, please escalate this.  I know what I did, what I saw and I now see it doesn't add up on your end.  This needs to be brought to the attention of management because there is a possibility of a rogue employee or a very bad bug if those logs say I placed the order at 165.  I did not place the order at 165, I placed it at 265.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:30:02
It doesn't matter, the documentation says this should not happen, please see my thread I created: 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:39:28
The first reason you stated for not getting involved is having to pay for gains?  Isn't that a desirable situation to be in?  I've been in bitcoin for years and I have zero gains as far as the IRS is concerned because I haven't cashed anything out.
  
For the second reason, open a bank account other than your primary account strictly for bitcoin and if it gets closed, move to another bank.  This way you don't threaten the regular account you depend on for saving and paying bills.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:47:15
I think I would have bigger problems.  Just because I have a sell order up for 100k, doesn't mean I cant cancel it if we have some sort of financial armageddon.  If we had inflation that bad, I would not be looking to sell bitcoin for it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:45:30
I did not typo that order!  I placed my order at 265.  I watched that thing for 15-20 minutes until it filled.  You are about to lose a customer here.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:43:34
You don't have to wait for anything, just report when you should.  It's all about what happened and when.  Also, many companies are gearing up to make it easy to do your taxes by allowing you to dump your history in a format that is easily imported into tax software.  This will become the norm going forward and it will make doing your taxes very easy.  Right now you can do it using third party services like:

Do you have a reason to doubt the evidence or are you just following a hunch?
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:16:49
I did not typo it.  I watched that order at 265 for 15+ minutes waiting for it to fill.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:20:52
I went ahead and made a thread about this since its been 24 hours with no response from coinbase and this has the potential to financially impact people.  There are no options for selling it is very basic right now.  It looks just like the sell window pictured here: 
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:56:40
Bitcoin offers the central powers even more power than they already have.  Right now, fiat currency in its paper form is basically anonymous.  Anonymity is only desirable for the central power, not for those they have power over.  Bitcoin offers them a chance to remove that anonymity in the long term.  They cannot do it with paper money, so they will embrace bitcoin for what it offers them, more power.  Information *is* power.
  
The guns will be used to ensure bitcoin, not to destroy it.  They are already taking hold of the system and enumerating it using the guise of compliance.  They are probably working on taking control of mining too.  We're already seeing them turn a blind eye to bad players in the mining market because it serves their system of control.  Better to let people be robbed and turn away from mining then to have to compete with your own citizenry.
  
One day we will wake up and the US Government will own 51% of the network.  For the children, of course.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:18:00
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:32:38
Yep, I'm familiar, but there are no fees right now.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:31:52
I put up a market order.  The Coinbase Exchange functionality is basic right now and I don't see limit orders present, there aren't any rules you can put on a sell other than sell X at Y price.
@_date: 2015-01-29 01:10:45
Thanks, Michael.  Even though the conclusion is opposed to what I remember I am happy with the diligence Coinbase displayed in trying to satisfy my concerns.  Coinbase has been nothing but professional.  I have already executed a few trades on the exchange to verify what I saw and to see for my own eyes that it works as advertised.  
   
I want to apologize because I don't usually get mad but I definitely did earlier when you told me I made a typo and that was just plain irrational on my part.  I am sorry about how I acted. 
  
I am looking forward to the UI and feature improvements in the future!
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:22:16
That is the exchange documentation, did you even look at the URL?
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:58:15
Just find someone local who will sell to you at spot prices.  There is no reason to pay a $30-$70 premium for something as common as a maple leaf.  I know of a half a dozen places locally that will sell these at spot price.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:26:12
I live in the US in California.  I do live in a big city and we have everything from the pawn shops that will rob you blind to honest precious metal dealers.  Before the internet, I used to visit coin shops and ask what gold bullion they had for spot and I would only ever buy at spot.  If they had nothing, I would leave my card in case something came up and walk out.  Now I find them on the internet, using Yelp and Google.  Just look for precious metal dealers, call them up and ask if they sell gold and silver bullion at spot, some sell at spot plus a small premium which is always better than premium + shipping that you find online.  A lot of these places have something they will sell for spot because they bought it for cheaper at an earlier time.  Sometimes nothing can be found.  There have been dry spells in my area in the past.
  
I honestly haven't looked in a while since I found a very reliable dealer in the past few years who always has bullion and always sells me maple leafs at spot.  I like maple leafs because of the purity.

I always downvote people who cry about downvotes.  I don't think I am alone with this behavior.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:09:22
I'm seeing that this will probably be my last reply to you.  I stated my reasons for posting it here and I posted it here as a matter of fact.  I didn't actually get upset until a CS rep tried to tell me something happened one way when I know it happened another.  CS reps don't get to look at the logs nor do they necessarily have direct access to those that do.  There is a good chance that the CS rep had bad info or no info and was just coming up with what they felt was the most likely scenario.
  
Regardless of everything that led up to this, the Director of Engineering is reviewing this closely with his team and that is all I can really ask for.  Sometimes, when you know you're right, you have to stick to your guns to bring out the truth to those that need to see it.  I did not typo the price and the events leading up to the fill make no sense if I had.  The truth will come out and I will post it here unless they ask me not to. I really just care to know that it will not happen to anyone else and that it I will get my listed price the next time I list bitcoin on the exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:11:34
It is there when you look at it using the wayback machine.  But I don't know how trustworthy that is.  I wonder if it was possibly restored from a backup after one of their many failures\hacks in the past years.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:59:11
You have to report gains.  It doesn't matter if you convert it to local currency.  If you buy a rock for $100 and then sell it for $10,000, that is a gain.  If you traded that same rock for something worth $10k like a piece of land, that is a gain and should be reported.  The problem for the IRS is that it can be very difficult to know about these types of gains so they often go unreported. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:55:16
Convenience and price.  The premium for localbitcoins is very high compared to exchanges and is only really worth it if you care about anonymity.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:17:06
The bottom line is that bitcoin has potential to increase in value that your traditional accounts do not.  All investments are a risk and the potential gains are usually proportional to the risk.  Bitcoin is high risk, high reward.  Also, traditional accounts aren't as safe as they used to be, see Cypress as an example.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:51:41
I probably used the wrong term, there is only one way to place an order on the exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:39:10
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:27:37
The exchange is fee free for the first 60 days.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:15:02
I did not typo that order.  I know this for fact, it is fresh in my memory, I watched the order sit there until it filled, I even showed my co-worker.
  
When I placed the order to sell 1 BTC at 265, the price was around 260 at the time.  I had to wait for about 15-20 minutes for it to fill, the whole time watching my order and the order book.
  
If I really did place it at 165 and the price was 260, why would I have to wait that long for it to fill?  And it didn't fill until the price hit 265.  This is besides the fact that I know i placed my order at 265.
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:20:05
This.  I hate bait and switch marketing and this reeks of it.  Releasing a product under a license that gains you a favorable view from the public and then changing that license to a less favorable one once you're established is shitty.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:12:00
This has nothing to do with the lost 91 cents, I really could care less about it.  This has to do with the integrity of a service I rely on and recommend to people close to me.  I am a long time user of coinbase and I have recommended it to many people that now use it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:16:14
Or I pointed out a bug that they found and fixed but no one wants to fess up to.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:20:15
I would let it slide if I thought there was even the slightest chance I made a typo.  I did not make a typo.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:43:13
That is correct.  Keep in mind that purchasing items with BTC is the same as converting to fiat.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:01:44
Here is their documentation on it, I'll copy and bold the relevant part.
  
  
From Example 2 on that page: **A buy order cannot execute for higher than the amount specified, and a sell order cannot execute for lower than the specified amount.**
  
But my sell order did execute for lower than the specified amount.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:51:35
coinbase rep already replied to this thred confirming it is real, but it appears they're doing damage control because he is saying I did something that I know for a fact I did not do.
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:57:56
If it's not a bug, it should be much clearer when you place an order about what the rules of that order are.  Right now, you can only set x quantity at y price.  So you would expect that x won't sell until y price is reached, but that's not what happened.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:29:29
Not so fast.  I put up a sell order for 1btc at 265 yesterday and they sold it for 264.09.  What kind of exchange does that?  I have never heard of an exchange selling your order for less than you listed it but they did this to me yesterday and I have been afraid to use it since.  I've been waiting to hear from their customer service for a day now.
  
**EDIT: The director of engineering investigated this and provided me with the relevant log snippet. If the uid is indeed mine then I did somehow enter my order as 165 and not 265. I am certain it was 265 but I am moving on because I have no way to prove it and the evidence introduces enough doubt for anyone that looks at it. The behavior of the order not filling until the price reached 265 has been explained to me and it is consistent with the UI weirdness I saw where I had to manually update the page to update my order after it showed as filled. They're working on that.**
**I have been told that they are looking at adding the listed price and not just the sell price to our history view and I think that is a great step. I'm sorry if anyone's feathers were ruffled but I saw what I saw and I had to make sure it was reviewed. I've done my due diligence and I'm moving on. Coinbase is still sexy to me.**
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:26:52
You don't think they will be worth 100k each someday? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:33:26


This one is easy and you are probably already practicing it with other investments.  Don't risk more than you can afford to lose.  If you can't risk anything, don't buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:58:39
We need more information from you in order to answer that question.  Bitcoin is global so we need to know where you live in order to know what options are available to you.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:07:48
That's something, I guess.  I'm sorry if you feel like I'm giving you a hard time but I know what I did and what I saw.  And as a long time user of coinbase who is a big fan of the service and has recommended it to many people who also use the service, I am personally invested in its integrity.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:49:20
Coinbase has over 2 million wallets.  I'm not sure what that equates to in terms of users but it definitely gives them an advantage over new players to the market.
@_date: 2015-01-26 23:26:54
Now I'm confused.  Are you skeptical about the story of how they found Ross or skeptical of TOR being compromised?
@_date: 2015-01-29 19:28:19


  
It's open source, just compare their code to trezors and you have your answer.  I suspect you're not qualified to qualify them.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:23:32
That is exactly what I thought happened at first.  I assumed they charged me a fee since I never imagined this would happen.  But upon closer inspection of my exchange history, it sold at 264.09 with 0 fee.
@_date: 2015-01-27 00:14:58
That looks like a tough one.  Coinify.com acquired a bitcoin exchange that serviced Algeria but it's not clear if they service Algeria.  Another option is localbitcoins.com but take my advice: do not sell to someone using paypal.
  
Another option is to post in bitcointalk.org and see if anyone wants to meet-up to do an exchange.  Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:01:57
No.  I was **selling** 1 BTC for 265, they sold it for 264.09.  That should never happen.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:45:14
I gave them 24 hours for a problem that can affect peoples money and I checked in on my ticket multiple times over that period.  I care about and I care about coinbase so felt obligated to inform the community about my experience and possibly kick-start the support on coinbase.  I felt it was a reasonable time to give them since it went unacknowledged and it can impact the community negatively.
  
Coinbase is not crooks, if anything maybe they have a crook under them but I'm not convinced it's not a bug.  I am certain that I did not make a typo, while I am not above them, I am certain in this case that there wasn't one on my part.
  
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:26:37
No mistype on this one, I placed the order and literally watched it until it filled.  It said 265 the whole time but when I looked at my wallet I had 264.09 and at first I thought they charged me a fee, but my history indicates it sold for 264.09.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:58:35
Per my last email, please escalate this to management.  I know for a fact I placed that order at 265.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:08:26
I'm signed in right now.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:25:40
I recently bought one for 1.5 bitcoins on ebay.  I have seen them on ebay and bitcointalk.org under the goods section and they always fetch a premium.
  
It's hard to know if they will always fetch a premium otherwise I would suggest you hold onto it.  If you still want to sell it in a few weeks when I get paid, I'm willing to offer 1.5 btc and I insist on escrow.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:15:27
I stared at my sell order for a good 15+ minutes listed at 265.  I know what I typed and what I saw, I also showed it to my co-worker and we talked about it while I was waiting for it to fill.
  
All of that aside, If I did make a typo and typed 165 instead of 265, why did it take until the price reached 265 before it filled?  Why didn't it execute right after I listed it?  Keep in mind the price was around 260 when I listed it.  
  
 The Director of Engineering is looking into it.  Maybe they will find the answer, maybe they won't, but at least I didn't give up and let it go unnoticed.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:03:16
I am not delusional therefor I have no time-frame.  It sells when it sells and I wasn't planning to sell before that price anyway.  These coins were never in my control, I've always left a percentage of my coins on Coinbase.  Most of my coins are in my control but a small percentage is not.  I just took the coins that I normally leave dormant on my coinbase wallet and created sell orders for them.  It's easy to cancel an order and transferring them between the exchange and my wallet is instant, so if I ever needed to use them in a pinch, I still can.  But why not leave them up for my exit price?
