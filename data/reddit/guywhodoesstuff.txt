Well they were right when they said that it could go to $10,000 back when it was like $200

By what calculations can bitcoin's value be determined at the range you stated? I'm not an economic expert of any kind but I'm sure there are a lot of factors involved.
Considering there are only a limited amount of bitcoin's possible, I'd say that in the **long run** it will probably go up as it becomes more and more widely adopted globally. The price drop now is probably largely due to (the newly bitcoin-adopting) merchants cashing out to fiat. 
The physical and digital infrastructure that has already been developed/established for bitcoin will likely give it a firm hold in the economy, as opposed to any other cryptocurrency.

I'm not sure what the hell is actually going on but Garzik is sounding like Trump on Twitter and r/btc gives me a r/The_Donald vibe...
This has some entertainment value for sure, but I wish we could see some hard evidence that proves on side or the other

next stop $10,000

I sent mine last night to Bittrex but it's still only 9/20 confirmations. Probably stuck for a while

Definitely gonna be a massive-ass sell wall at $10,000

Install bitcoin core and find where it keeps the wallet.dat file and replace that one with your old backup.
Windows it was users/name/appdata/roaming/bitcoin core i believe
I just found $1000 in an old dogecoin wallet from 2013 doing this. It just took a long-ass time to sync.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:22:17
Yeah cryptocurrencies are really lacking in the user-friendliness. They need an iOS app store style easy interface to really take off to mainstream

Yup I've purchased bitcoin from them a few times now and can confirm their legitimacy. For my first purchase I just bought like $5 worth to make sure it was real, and it is, I've since made a fee larger purchases in the $100s range and it worked out fine 
@_date: 2012-10-09 02:13:41


Does anyone know more about this? Not sure if what I'm gathering from this is correct... Are "VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, Bank of America and Western Union" all that crooked that they would disallow funding to Wikileaks?
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:09:48
Well we just had a shit-load of negative news and this is where we're sitting so it's likely to be a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:40:55
It might actually make more sense to look at the price on an exponential scale as opposed to linear, seeing as how that is how it grows...

So ideally I should I create my wallet AND it's password offline/with fresh OS install? This confuses me a little bit, so how will the bitcoin network know where to send the bitcoin I transfer to my offline-created wallet, if, since the "deposit address" cannot have been uploaded to the network?
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:01:24
It's just the address, it's not a key
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:09:37
I think there is a good chance it might stay around where it's at till after Christmas, since people are buying gifts and stuff... Imo

I'm interested in using this, but how much is the exchange rate compared to the internet rate? I'd assume it's more?
It's just a lot quicker than doing a bank transfer!
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:14:34
What they need to really do is allow us to type "1 BTC in USD" to give a averaged exchange rate, like we can with all other *currencies* !

I've been dealing with CaVirtex for a year and they've been great, they're probably just swamped

the U.S government just wants to capitalize on all the bitcoins they stole during the Silk Road takedown.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:01:45
So many people still haven't even heard of bitcoin. I wonder what the price could be once it becomes a mainstream currency...
I watched it go from $15 to $100 thinking it would come back down so  I would invest. I'm investing now though because it is gaining serious traction.  I'm no longer skeptical, most people when they first hear about still are though... 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:05:22
So how would one file a claim? My 0.37 BTC I had in my account is worth a lot more than it used to be. (plus I'm Canadian and never used an American vendor)
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:14:14
Thanks for the answers, I've done the backing up on usb sticks, now I'm wondering, if I want to send BTC from my wallet, and say I open my wallet with Bitcoin QT on my internet-connected computer, will a malware program be able to detect my keystrokes as I enter my password? Or is that only a risk when creating it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:03:33
And I'd say more people are probably spending their pay cheques more on items at regular Black Friday sales instead of investing in cryptos
