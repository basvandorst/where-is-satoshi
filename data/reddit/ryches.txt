That was my problem exactly. I wanted to set up an arbitrage set up when all that was going on, but I knew that it'd take months to get my money out of gox if at all. Im sure there were plenty of people who didn't have that foresight or prior knowledge that could have pumped it up

But how would ebay confirm payment was sent. To me that seems like it would be sidestepping all of the security and protection they have in place

The comments section on this article show such little respect towards Bitcoin. I can understand the doubt, but they don't even understand the first part of it, but they are bashing it

Bitcoin has done a great job of educating me on global issues I didn't even know about. It'd be great if bitcoin can solve some, but I think it will be a slow process, just like bitcoins growth

I think one of the biggest things getting in the way is the constant view that people want to exchange their currency back and forth from dollars and bitcoin. I don't know how this would be avoided without a paradigm shift and bitcoin becoming the ruler that people look at rather than the dollar.
When you look at international business it is very common for those being paid to put out a reverse order for the currency exchange they are going to do. So if a company has agreed to a 1 million euros for their service they would view that as [1 million euros X exchange rate from euro to dollar]. For this example lets say that the exchange rate is 1.5 dollars per euro. So the company is expecting 1.5 million dollars after providing their service. But lets say that the service ends up taking a year to complete and the exchange rate from when they agreed to the contract has changed drastically in the course of a year and is now 1.25 dollars per euro. This means the company, in essence, lost a quarter millions dollars. What international companies do to manage this risk is take out a future contract for dollars to euros at a value of 1.5 million so that any exchange movement is negated by the reverse contract. 
We could do something similar on a micro scale with btc to usd. It would just be that the price change per time window would be greater. I'm sure that the large exchanges would love to take this on because it would bring in a ton of money as they could take in the normal spread of ask and bid but greatly increase volume. That being said, I don't think this will be the permanent solution. Eventually the identity of bitcoin will hopefully separate from that of a moving value in reference to dollars and have a value of its own. This is an interesting problem though because people don't usually worry about exchange movement in their day to day life.

I bet you 500 doll hairs that you won't do it!
@_date: 2014-01-08 04:50:30
I personally feel that you should just have the amount returned to you that you sent. Pay 1 btc. Return an item. Receive 1btc. It doesn't make sense to me that we always have to view things in reference to the dollar.

Im talking about the last three weeks, not the whole history of bitcoin.

It's not necessarily comparing the size, but it is showing how big of a utility bitcoin could be for them. If the difference between a 5% profit and 2% profit then the company is going to push hard for it and advertise more for it more than a company already on 50% margins because it has a smaller relative impact

You can't really say butterfly labs was a "little" late. They handled themselves very unprofessionally and left everyone completely in the dark as far as their progress for months and ignored almost all support calls and emails. At least you had someone to talk to.  Not saying cointerra isn't in the wrong, but I think both of them had their issues

Well all currencies have some volatility and trend, but the price truly has been stagnant. I actually think usd/btc has been more stable than most other forex pairs in the same period of time
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:49:19
People cant complain about volatility anymore, really. Been locked in with the USD for quite a while now

I spend so much time on eBay and PayPal and I honestly just don't know how they would implement bitcoin. Especially the handling of returns. Currently with the way things work the seller is notified that they have received payment and then they can go ahead and ship. In the case of a return then eBay can tell that the money has been refunded and when the item is actually returned because of tracking numbers. The whole untraceable aspect of bitcoin would be shot down in this model and I can't think of a scheme where it would actually be advantageous.

That just reduces the number of spaces you have to look right. You look right and count two commas then you count how many spots to the left of that comma.

You can trade back and forth infinite coins with zero loss. You can just sit there and buy and sell at the same price a million times. nothing has changed and no bitcoins have truly changed hands. In an exchange with fees this wont happen because someone will get their money eaten into because of fees. volume can be 100% spoofed in a feeless exchange

What's the point of doing a transaction at 2am? 
@_date: 2017-01-07 23:29:09
Yes and bitcoin is also dead
@_date: 2016-12-07 09:28:13
From what I can tell, yes. I never understood this because I use PayPal a ton for my business and didn't understand why everyone was using venmo for their small transactions like splitting a meal or something when the paypal app does the same thing  with no fees when sending via friends and family. You can send money to a phone number or email address or name just like in venmo. In PayPal you can even send a PayPal.me link and they can pay via that link so they don't even need to login or have an app. 
It is some weird branding move that has obviously worked because everyone I have ever talked to is adamant that venmo is superior to paypal. I think the app just strips away the additional features to only the money transfer and people like the simplicity.

Glad to see the context. Last I checked the top couple richest people probably had nearly 10x that number alone.

I understand this is just something that happens when you grow a sub so ridiculously fast but it's very frustrating that so many people are getting in on this and using it purely as an investment scheme. At this point it truly is a ponzi scheme. Those of us who got in early are making bank and those who got in late are going to get screwed over if we don't get more people actually focused on the core product soon.
Currently bitcoin is not what it was promised to be. It will not scale and be a useful product as anything more than a store of value. There was a point everyone was bragging about their local bitcoin atms or a local pub or coffee shop that took bitcoin. Those use cases are currently dead. Confirmation time is way too slow and fees are way too high.
Sure it can be used succesfully for remittances where speed and fees are not crucial, but as it stands bitcoin is not what it was hyped to be and it's utility is much more limited than I would have hoped at this point.
Not going to act like I am unhappy about the price increase. Ive been in bitcoin since it was 15 cents way back when and thought I was literally paid to compute for someone else and had no understanding of what bitcoin really was. But I hope this massive wave of newcomers eventually takes an active interest like I did and takes some time to understand exactly what they're investing in.
I've spent years going through this subreddit with almost all the discussion going over my head because people were so knowledgeable about the technology and all of underlying philosophy and policies. I hope that is not lost on the newcomers. That information is more sparse now
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:22:06
Yeah but now the last 10% will take 90% of the time. That's how this works, right? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:10:51
I totally agree. bitcoin is by no means infallible and the end all coin. I was just explaining that mechanic because it sounded like the previous guy was not aware of that. Figured I'd do a little splaining. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:56:53
it doesnt lose its value over time though because they also receive a percentage of all transaction fees which means that ass the circulation grows and people spend more bitcoin the miners continue to have a source of income while the actual reward from the distribution of coins decreases

do you have any miners to sell? 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:36:45
How are you slighted in any way? It's totally reasonable when you're bragging about your multi million dollar operation to at least post some proof. You shouldve had a picture from the start to show it off and now youre being all butthurt about uploading the pictures. A normie would have just gone out and taken a picture the first time someone asked them to see a picture. It isnt some ridiculous request
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:25:59
I would but you dont have an investor relations group

Most people wouldnt be attacking him if he just took one photo and posted it. I'd get past him being an insufferable douchebag if he just showed actual proof

he literally never said he disliked you. you're just being an insecure lying autist
@_date: 2017-07-01 09:17:54
I think he was saying he sells it for $300 beyond the price he paid fron bitmain and sounds like most his profit is coming from that aspect of his operation

For a little bit of background, Benjamin Graham was one of Warren Buffets teachers and then eventually his partner. Definitely something needed to be read
