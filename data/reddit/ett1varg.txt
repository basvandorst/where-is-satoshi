Because anyone with an ounce of intelligence knows that diversification can protect your wealth.

I got Litecoin for crazy cheap today.  hodl strong boys
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:57:53
Same.  XRP saved my ass.

Bitcoin.org is a great place to start.  It was over my head at first but after some time spent researching it's making more sense now.
Here is Satoshi Nakamoto's famous "White Paper"

How on Earth is that statement an example of hubris?  The idea of making money is exciting. It has nothing to do with arrogance or self-confidence.   I bet you're a real blast to hang around.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:48:45
The price locks in when you buy.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:02:23
Same. Got in at 2,200 as well.  Happy hodling my friend!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:03
What the fuck did I just read?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:38:55
That's a tough one.  Honestly, I believe that the huge influx of users within the last couple of months will mean that segwit2x will fail significantly.  It may take a slight dip, but BTC under 10,000 is a steal IMO and I've continued to add to my position.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:37:21
Those who cash out are making plenty.  I don't think it is unreasonable for someone to get excited over potential profits either...
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:14:41
It will hit 10k by the end of the year.  Price points are crazy right now and you are just now starting to see the surge of new people rushing into BTC.  There is more to come.
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:19:01
Don't be surprised by that sort of response here.  This sub is cock-full of elitist douchebags.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:07:55
Yes. You can cash out at any time. Did it yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:06:09
Get back in. You can buy fractions of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:18:24
Here we gooooo!
@_date: 2017-11-25 03:42:56
RemindMe! Of this in 1 year

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:09:57
You gonna pay taxes on that bro?
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:18:03
I have a much better idea now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:52:50
You don't have to buy an entire Bitcoin. It's a common misconception. You can buy whatever fraction of Bitcoin you'd prefer.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:31:28
I understand. I am the same way.  Started getting back in when it hit around 1000 but I could have been slowly increasing my position for what is now dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:18:36
1. Buy BTC.
2. Do not sell said BTC
3. Win
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:27:24
Same... I've wiped all my alerts out within a month.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:26:17
So they can't celebrate now... who cares if it makes everyone millions or not. Making money is something that is exciting no matter how much it is.  The only smug one in here seems to be you...
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:12:04
If you want an example of real hubris you need to take a look at what you've just posted and read it back to yourself.
*Potential* profits were the words I used, buddy. Nothing was taken for granted.  Why you are on this sub bashing everyone when you don't know anything about it is beyond me.  I'm also pretty sure everyone here understands the inherent risk within this space.  Go ahead and keep bitching from the sidelines. It's obviously doing a lot of good
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:50:49
Bruh...that is a LOT more than 3.6k right now...
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:50:08
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:25:47
Ok asshole find them yourself.

Do you want shirts already made or are you looking for a place to make your own designs?
