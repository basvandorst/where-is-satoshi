Agree, and we're challenging that right now. We want to get rid of the price limit and let the user freely choose, but we need a better rating system to avoid scams.
I think we have a good one in mind, we wil release it (hopefully!! :D) in about 1 month

If the price is 0.5btc you have a deal :)

Forbitcoins does not work. Try pressing the order button. Answering you, I believe we both have modified versions of the same script. Both of them are a clone of fiverr.com (which is the original).

I would love to be in that bitcoin team, not only to share my practices, but also to learn.

I think people who are actually using bitcoins are not consumptive. So i think we should:
a) prepare lots of services/shops.. etc in order to be prepared to accept new consumers.
b) start a marketing campaign making easy to others (the consumptive ones) to adopt and spend bitcoins.
But i think that there is a risk when using bitcoin at first time. 'will the goods arrive?' 'is this safe?' so i think the "cheaper in bitcoin" philosophy is the one that we should all adopt, in order to reward trust.

I think this is a very important product for the bitcoin economy, you should put an email to contact you just in case someone who owns a porn site want to add it to the platform.

Hi there! i'm the webmaster of bitcoinerr.com... thank you so much, youaresatoshi for rating us as "THE BEST" :D
Indeed there's a lot of talent in bitcoinerr.com. I've myself hired some people from bitcoinerr.com and learned a lot of them. People are doing great jobs very cheap. For instance, i asked a guy for a jquery code that i used in other project, and learned from that (and he earned some bitcoins). 
But anyway my only wish for this new year is that people realize that they have to spread the link to their job (for example in their signature  so others can see what they do and hire their services :D (we're doing some things to achieve this).
Again thank you for your words!
