I don't wanna know what happens when I sell!
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:15:36
Is this what going up 6% looks like?
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:26:03
Sorry to hear that :( Out of curiosity, did you have 2FA set up for your account?
Edit: or does 2FA not matter at all if the exchange is hacked like this?
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:24:07
It worked fine! I guess I have like $2 USD more worth of BTC now :P
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:49:54
Just a bit...I think I saw Bitfinex go under $4100. Interesting seeing the selling activity happen at once

Bad bot!
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:31:37
Pattern: I buy at what i think is the dip, BTC drops way more!

Agreed. Can I ask why everyone is upvoting this comparison? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:44:05
I have to agree with you here...Bitcoin is not a solve-all currency **yet**.
Between the volatility, limited means of acquiring Bitcoin, and the complexity of using it, it has a ways to go.
That said, I am optimistic that it will get very close to being an ideal currency and means of payment very soon. Well, before I die at least :)

Same. This is my first time hearing about OpenBazaar but Im curious now to sell something through it!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:04:42
Almost forgot about the sign guy...and it was just two weeks ago! Thanks for taking the time to put this together!

While I haven't done this yet, my miniscule amount of BTC in Kraken did split to an equivalent amount of BCH.
Now I see on Kraken I can sell BCH for USD, EUR, or XBT (BTC). Short of hitting the sell button, it looks like it's working fine.

So you can get 10% off using BTC and also use the Duty Free benefit as a foreigner, correct?

The IRS has specifically addressed Bitcoin taxation in Notice 2014-21. Basically, they said "we will tax you whenever you sell 'virtual currency', for goods, other currency, etc"
For investors, this makes sense as it is not difficult to keep track of buy/sell orders. But I think it's unrealistic to treat it as such for day-to-day purchases. The gov't is definitely slowing down the usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by leaving adopters very accountable for usage.

China banned ICO's previously...and this time they are ousting Exchanges. Neither times have they banned Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies
Edit: unclear at this time what the real story is. I have yet to read a clear and accurate source of information that doesnt rely on speculation

I just set up Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1 on my Lenovo TS140 that I mainly use for Plex (Windows 10 machine).
It took about 12 hours to download the entire blockchain and has 18 connections right now. The setup was really easy...just download from bitcoin.org, install, let it sync, open up port 8333, and wait.
Also using it now as a wallet. Working great! Haven't noticed any slowdowns and not much bandwidth use yet.

They use what is recommended from this site:
Currently, the fastest/cheapest fee is 360 satoshis/byte according to this site. I suspect Exodus uses a fee slightly higher than this so the user experience is better (aka faster transactions).
0.01931759 BTC/4370 bytes = .00000442 BTC/byte (442 satoshis/byte)
This fee is a bit higher than their recommendation, but this is always changing depending on the situation.

Thanks for the easy way to verify! Currently downloading the blockchain using 0.15.0.1 to my Plex server, should work just fine as a full node too :)
A little slow to download the blockchain though...hovering around 100 kB/s.
Edit: Gaining momentum now. After only 5 minutes, it's downloading at a higher rate!
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:12:59
It doesn't change the fact that you have capital gains on the value of BTC. Still technically a taxable event (as far as I understand)
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:18:21
No. BCH = Bitcoin Cash.
The BCH split happened a while ago and this chain is still going and has some value. What everyone is saying is that you also have the equivalent amount in BCH too. For example, if you had 8 BTC, you will also have 8 BCH.
Not sure how you are storing the BTC right now, but you have to take some action to split the BCH from BTC.

It says "Shinjuku Marui" (stylized as 0101 for their logo)

I just split the remaining BCH from some BTC i had in a different wallet. I never had confidence in BCH, but I didnt want to make a move until I understood what the fork meant. It was good practice for me to try it last night.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:07:58
Well, it is intuitive
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:49:49
At this rate, about how much longer will this take?
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:47:54
Gemini is back online now.
Edit: Back offline at 11:37PM EST
Edit2: Back online at 12:32AM EST
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:15:46
Agreed. I've used Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. Gemini is my favorite, especially how they set up the fees, I think they are very reasonable.
One question...does anyone know of a mobile app that tracks Gemini? I can't seem to find one...
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:25:18
How much processing power does the machine need? Is this something I can use old hardware with? I'm happy to share some bandwidth.
