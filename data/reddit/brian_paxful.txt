Just to update your account should now be credited, 
i haven't got the full detail of the issue as its still been looked into but seems to be related to a limited number of deposit addresses linked to old accounts and your case should now help to identify the exact issue.
sorry again for the lack of helpful frontline support on this issue

I dont understand how did they send funds to you on revolut?
was it via payment link or user to user transfer? because if it was payment link I've heard of many people using stolen credit cards to pay that way.
also if it was a SEPA transfer revolut will only accept deposits from an account in your name so was it that someone deposited money from a third party (probably hacked) account

Thanks, 
If it helps our dev team is personally looking at it right now and i have to say thanks as this might be an issue with old single sig addresses but I wont speculate in public, 
In any case your efforts are much appreciated (although you should not have to scream here to get an technical answer to a technical problem) 
Will update as soon as its resolved 
@_date: 2019-03-09 20:43:17
hmm but in that case they say very clearly that is you send money via sepa to them and to your revolut account it must be from a bank account in your name no?

Bisq is what is... a good p2p platform for exchangeing crypto assets but fact is its more or less impossible to buy bitcoin there with fiat as you need to have a security deposit (in crypto) 
if you want a p2p exchange where you can buy crypto for fiat I have to recommend paxful (full disclosure I work on their product team) 
 but in short we offer 300 different ways for you to get into crypto from cash to bank transfers to even gift cards, Hell we even accept paypal but I think our vendors probably require a dna sample before trading with you because of how easy to chargeback it is :D
Any questions you can find us over at r/paxful

when you go to the fiat world enforcing things gets 100 times harder so I don't have an answer for you.
essentially you need a custodian who would have something to back the loan from the other party and if they have that backing they could afford the bitocins anyway.
in theory right now you can lend (via leverage) on bitfinex

To add to what ray has said there it might be there is some issue with legacy addresses depositing correctly.
I will pass your case on to our dev team who will make sure that other users who deposit to a legacy address don't encounter the same issues and the least i can do is to follow up with an exact explanation for your issue.
again please accept my apologies for this, it should have been escalated sooner and it's clear the agent in question didn't understand your complaint

Just to update you the issue has been detected and will be patched, without going into too much detail some of bitcoin-core's API functions are being deprecated and a dns change meant your deposit did not reflect in your account.

it is they are banked with LHV and you can see it if you open the app and choose bank trasfer

or you can just buy an amazon.com gift card for 25% off on paxful and get everything for btc WITH A DISCOUNT

there are several "payday bitocin loans" services.
you deposit your crypto there, they give you 50% of its value in USD and if you dont pay it back in X time they liquidate your crypto.
seems pretty safe and fair for both parties if you ask me 
@_date: 2018-10-03 13:39:44
what do you mean "locked in accounts" if you purchased the card and loaded it to your card it was all good right?
on purse.io right now and max discount im seeing is about 5% on the homepage

Hi, 
Sorry it took to long to get an on point response.
The crux of the matter is we are not in control nor make profit on our sendout fees.
We use bitgo as our wallet provider which is one of the most trusted in the industry which allows us to outsource security to one of the most trusted wallet providers, the downside being their service is far from free.
I don't have the exact facts to hand on how their pricing is calculated as its been fixed at 0.0005 for some time now but i will inquire and update my post when i have facts for you

My 100% p/l short doesnt give a shit but its a bit sad you missed the chance to capitalize on the downside
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:59:32
they are peer to peer but there is no fiat liquidity there.
use paxful .com instead
