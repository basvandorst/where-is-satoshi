I dont know, man. Getting butt fucked by a few dozen big black cocks might change your mind sooner than you think.

There's ways to find hidden assets​, crypto is no different. If the court finds out he has been hiding assets he is fucked.
Anyway, I thought the discussion is what happens in divorce when the wife already knows he has btc. Even in that scenario he's fucked.

Those numbers from statisticbrain.com have been circulating a lot lately but they are sketchy at best. They don't even provide source or reasoning for any of their numbers.
There are more credible sources that say that about 50% of first marriages end in divorce (depending on where you live in the western world). 50% and 94% percent is not even close, someone fucked up.

Is someone triggered by reality?
And I love women, wtf is wrong with you...

But he can send him to jail if they know he has btc and refuses to hand it over.
Don't think for one second that hiding assets is a good idea in divorce court.

People change overnight. Especially women when they get married.


Because it's so much better to live your life based on feelings rather than cold hard numbers and observable reality.

Why would they kill you? They'll just throw you in jail to make you change your mind.

It's not sexist, it's simply unjust. 
However, the law says they have every right to a man's money.

Prenups aren't worth any more than toilet paper in a divorce.
Only way you can protect your bitcoin in a divorce is if she doesn't know about them.

Wanna bet on it?
If she knows you have bitcoin then she can and will demand to split those assets in a divorce. And the judge will force you to hand over those assets, make no mistake about it...
