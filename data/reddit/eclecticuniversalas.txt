Bitcoin was once a science fair project in that sense you use, im sure their are endless ways to keep your money, and probably even more on how to lose it. The point was. That this is new tech and it should evolve, Remember AOL, Altavista, basic, hypercard, DOS, . . now microsoft, google, Im sure there are still people who hold dearly to macintosh computers today, but with tech and especially new tech like blockchain and other transfer ideas. We are in a new and rapidly changing environment. And in this environment. Not only is the original BTC being tweaked and forked (not all good), but also their is an alt crypto boom party going on around the corner. And everyone around the globe is free to explore. . And those exploring will undoubtably congregate around the party that serves them best

I am in search of all possibilities both inside and outside of bitcoin. and like beta went to vhs, and then to cd and then to dvd, . perhaps with btc, . . there is a better solution down the road and it wont involve bitcoin per se.

Figure it out, every 2 days coinbase want me to re sign in on my phone and verify a new device, but its not a new device,my phone with coinbase works on the road for a few days, and I turn of the wifi of my phone due to complications with my Uber app, . Anyways coinb works well this way for a few days then crashes as if it doesnt recognize my device again.  When I try to log on and do their 2 step verification process the second part of that verification is asking to click the url to finish the process but this part becomes dysfunctional. . the solution I think is that I have to go home, turn on my phones wifi, and shut down and re turn on my phone again. then do the process and re log onto coinb just to use it. . What a pain in the ass, I dont want to keep entering in my password info over wifi every two days. and i think it may be because thats how i first signed up with them. All i want is a simple and easy way to buy and sell btc through a bank on my phone, not be 20 miles away from home and see an opportunity, just to have to run back home and reload coinb while the prices change, . found it here, .

yes, bither was the option I was using at last before this methode, it was well but it seemed i needed to use both their online and offline wallets together in tandem,(Proprietary) I had to have it on my phone as well . im not sure of this though as I went on from there rather quickly to this last method i am using now, it solved proprietary issues,my current one can now be used with any cross platform applications easily through qr code scanning and screen image, . I liked the bither cold wallet app as it did let me use a data transfer neutered permanently offline phone which i could password and swipe pattern protect, . but with this one i am using now, it can now be used with many apps such as coinbase and mycelium easily

She says yes you need to make paper, you cant solely rely upon technology. . . I said yes you can rely solely upon tech.  I said " I now have my own wallet.  It stores my money and my passwords for the places i visit, . It has a copy of my drivers license, its on a qr code when the cops want to see it. . . Its all on my wallet" . .to access it you must swipe pattern to onlock, type in a password, and get past encryption, . and that is to open it. . IT IS ENTIRELY offline. . To do other things, I use my phone. . . I have one source, . no more paper money. no more writing passwords and usernames on paper. . its all on my wallt. (As I hold up the samsung sch1200, . .

yes the root was for ceasing all data transmission at a root sub level, . .  As I stated google itself currently keeps trying to find ways around my specs in the phone settings of no wifi no bluetooth and the phone being in airplane mode, . with all this selected, google still seeks ways around it and yesterday found a way to connect to a wifi on my cold phone without asking me enable it, it turned back on data transmission and left it on.  to me this is unacceptable for any of the proprietary software, .The idea to root is to get at a sublevel area of the software and either change permissions to radio transmission access, or to remove, corrupt,  or cripple that process permanently and entirely itself, . one could even rewrite the entire software program to not even know data transmission software exists., .the desire to root was not to install third party software, .  to rephrase "To root a phone, does not compromise security", . Its when you use root to modify the programing in an irresponsible way or use it to allow the install third party apps that compromises it, . . .however which is not what i am choosing to do  . . In the area i am exploring, . it can actually better help secure your personal data if done correctly. It keeps proprietary android apps like google from transferring data through the hardware abilities when you are not looking, .  . for me in the future, rooting may be a way to further stop any data transmission, . as for now, the system I am using is working well for me, (other than the google incident) it is secure for the most part, easily transportable, , works cross platform in regard to easy bitcoin trades,  etc. . . I am very happy with it actually ecstatic, to me its like a trezor yet with more processing capabilities and a better screen, and it was free, , the more i hold it and use it, the better i like it. . yet i can see the road to further improvement, .. thank you for the question and giving me the opportunity to clear that up, . i know im long winded, and yes , . .rooting was solely for the purpose of ceasing all data transmission and if used only in that way should not compromise the devices security but enhance it.

i dont need security updates as the phone has been crippled to not transmit or receive data, Its simply a stand alone offline device that creates and produces qr codes on a screen and can scan qr as well, . its no longer a phone but a simple hand held offline qr generator and scanner. . . also any data can be backed up to paper by using the sd card on an offline computer  if the user wishes, such as a pc using a linux boot distro on usb, . the sd could in theory also be directly placed in an offline printer for direct paper offline printing, . this systemt is more portable than a usb that needs a pc to generate cold wallet keys as i can use it anywhere anytime

in a computer program it branches out from a beginning core or most basic program and grows from there, . . as it grows the users allowed on the branches on the outside are granted permissions, . so on your  PC's "microwindows" for instance,  you cant touch the earlier programing unless you have proprietary permission, you are in essence a user logged onto their system. they give you your permission to be a user and grant you a folder downstream with a  password priveledge.  
 . . in LINUX (not microshit0 the mother core and original program is open source, meaning anyone can write upon it if they have the first permission password which in open source they do, The super user password is at the first branch core of a program system, . its the root owner "su" root with a permission protected password
 .. in LINUX the mother or earliest of all permissions of a written program is call the " superuser" which is abbreviated "su on a LINUX terminal screen"  it is also know as the root directory, .the first directory  .its at the root of the branching tree, . . 
so in LINUX you HAVE the mother permission super user password to rewrite the entire software program at its most basic beginning level and beyond.
 and on your microsoft laptop you cant get to the basic root software access they at microsoft retain privileges and its their proprietary licensed software, . .you dont have access to their root direvtories on normal means
NOW, - from what i understand, an android  phone fortunately has a  linux kernal, with an integrated android wrapper outside the core LINUX, which outside that verizon software also resides. . , . ..so on your phone if you have the "su" root password  of the LINUX core kernel you have more control over your phone, . . . .  you can tell the android wrapper what to do. . . and indeed the entire phones software from the lowest level
so when you root your phone you gain access to the root directory of the linux core of all software programming as the super user, because rooting simply gives you the "su" password and nothing more. . . if i have this right a law gave us permission to access to the linux core so these companies must give you the root password, it has an open source core
i am root on the linux pc i am typing this on right now, i have the su password to my PC operating system i installed on the hard disk
without microcrap, . its your pc, you have root program writing permissions, you tell the entire system what to do, not some proprietary program telling you what to do, . .thats how my own linux pc works (it has its advantages) (and disadvantages) 
So if you root your phone and eliminate and rewrite  these programs at will,  you can either tweek it entirely as you want it with root permission, 
,.  . ..or you can really muck it up and make it entirely non working and useless
but if you muck up  (minus the f with an m instead) an old useless laptop phone or PC , . hey, . . .it was already crippled by bloated microsoft malware anyway and it  an experience, . . and hey i learned from it. . I have personally myself installed Linux on a miriad of old useless PC's netbooks. and laptops, . bringing them fully back to life and free of bogged down unwanted add ons. 
i have not rooted a phone yet. . . . .but since i am using old phones that are wasting away in my drawers, . I  will hopefully root a few in the near future
If you are thinking of rooting a phone i would go through the linux community, . .or find someone you REALLY trust to do it malware free, . . the community is great, . since its open source, they all can see the beginning code and look for crap, . .
I cant tell you how to do it personally yet, . but i think i know what it does now, . look up the specs for your phone hardware and the word root on google or youtube,. lots of people do it for different reasons .  it helps if you know linux, i learned a little a while back, it was easy, a good way to know linux is to find an old stagnent laptop or PC with a good hard drive and erase microsoft off the original hard disk  and install a free open source LINUX distro, . this acn be done off a usb thumb drive. I have one on a USB, I can even boot my computer off my thumb drive when it turns on and run online solely off a USB memory stick which can not be written to or from, . when im done i turn of my PC or laptop and i have no hardisk trace, . . i do it all the time, . Its a LINUX iso on a USB drive, . its easy with an old PC you dont use, . you can even use microsoft and internet explorer to get online first and make a LINUX usb iso to use. . . if you get the iso from the linux community and listen to them, the iso will be free from malicious addition, . .from that you will have all permissions of your laptop, .  if you do this its like microsoft, you can get on utube with a browser like firefox etc, . you have folders on your desktop, . . for a beginning distro i would look for the most user friendly one, mint, fedora, ubuntu, . . i started with two, fedora and mint, . if one didnt fully install on a certain PC or laptop i would try the other one, . in most cases and a little online asking or searching, i had a new running system, ,,
when you boot off a usb thumb drive, it asks you if you want to run off of it alone or install it to a hard drive, . just run off the usb, and leave the computer hard drive totally offline if you want, . . . be warned, if you chose install to hard drive, it will delete all microcrap off your computer, you will lose all you data, the hard disk will be wiped clean, . . and a linux distro will be installed, . from then on you will not need the usb, . (unless you want to) 
find an old laptop or PC you dont care about,  go online and make a linux distro USB, . this can work on any old pc or laptop, . after making the bootable usb thumb drive you need to get into the pre startup of the hardware (usually a keypress before it comes on) and tell it what to originally boot off of, the hard disk, a cdrom, or a usb, . .almost all old computers let you do this, . .once you have the thunb drive put the thumb drive in and test drive it, . if you dont install it and dont like it, .dont put it in the usb slot next time and tell your beginning cmos to boot off the hard disk from now on, . .if you run off usb and then turn off a PC and leave without spinning the hard disk you leave no trace on the hard disk,.   play around with Linux, . you may already know some of this, or not, I dont know, . right know im just kinda young and learning myself at 55, . . . if some of this doesnt make sense it probably because i got sick of editing, . if you have any questions about it, just ask, . .i dont know all of it, theres too much, but im learning, . 
this is only of course if I have understood this all right, .about  rooting and most android phones. . 
for my purposes of completely stopping all data transfer through the air i think i have two means at my disposal, . rooting the device and stopping it there at the root for peace of mind, . or simply clipping the physical antenna within the hardware, . . i may find the latter easier, . i dont know yet, probably try them both and cripple a few phones in the process, . (not ones with btc and no external backup hopefully), . currently i am simply telling it to stop wifi and data, i have removed the verizon sim card, and putting it in airplane mode, . .google still wants to access data/internet transfer in a bad way on this phone, . its humorous and a hassle, . i will probably be rooting a few aquired old phones soon for the experience and starting up at the bottom with disabling wifi and data transfer, . I even understand you can first root it, then istall a pure linux desktop on it from the ground up.
. . . so in essence rooting an offline android phone helps you with security because as root you can control explicitly who askes for internet and data permissions at the lower most open source level, . I can shut them off before verizon and android have permission or even are installed if at all, . thanks to an androids open source linux kernal, and the existing open source software community and their efforts, . . if i have it all correct so far that is
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:18:24
I'm not sure what your saying,. If I generate an offline address and don't use it right away and leave it that way,. In theory, someone else could generate that address and put the public key online without me being aware (yes I know the odds), but if they did and I put funds in that address they would have access to my address, so if I generate an offline address, I should immediately process the public key online just to verify and hold that address?

Not necessarily,  This was my assumption at the start but my own phone proved me wrong, before any of this and at the start,  I reset my phone to factory defaults, got on my personal wifi at home with my wifi password, added a google account on the phone  so i could download the two apps i needed from the app store, (QRdroid and opera mini with off line page) then once i was all done installing I turned the wifi and data settings to "off" and put the phone in airplane mode, . . a day later my google account saw i was at home with a connected wifi, and turned the wifi on and transmitted data, . note my wifi setting was now changed to on, but the phone was still in airplane mode, and was transmitting data back to google,  . .I have since deleted the google account from the phone and told it to forget the home wifi connection and that seems to have fixed the problem, . i have not rooted my phone as of now, dont know if i will, . .but if anyone data bricking a phone is of the conspiracy type of mind they might look into it, .  yeah you dont have to root the phone as i can tell, And i havn't as of yet,  but if you don't make sure all google accounts are deleted and you tell it to forget your earlier wifi connection, that might help as airplane mode can apparently be over ridden by pre installed software.

thank you, my motivation with bitcoin is mostly from a view of a countries fiat system collapsing and the people in disarray,  one of the problems of bitcoin is its ease of use and availability, I can hardly see an entire population learning the current bitcoin system and safely securing their assets in such a situation, we all know how predators can prey upon those trying to learn this tech, . .so i am thinking that with a little tweaking of what i have started, . someone within the linux open source community could make a simple one step program that wipes the phone and installs an integrated balance book ledger, qr generator and cold storage system, . that way in a collapse situation, it would be easy for a larger percentage of the population to find an old phone laying around  and instantly get into a secure bitcoin asset rescue and begin trading immediately and safely without needing a whole lot of tech knowledge and new hardware, . then their government could work on repairing their economy while the people were safely securing their assets easily, quickly, and securely, without any big, investment,  tech knowledge, or effort. anyways thank you, . for anyone who is wondering about the video, you can see it here, . .

  My point wasn't how much this single ETF would effect the entire system, It was about how a decentralized global worldwide currency should not be directly connected to any localized fiat market systems.  Once you open the door in this way through regulation (the proposed ETF),  there will be without doubt more linking of internal local national markets.

I believe in diversity and hedging assets, Cash, Gold, BTC, Stocks, Bank Accounts, etc . . Dont know how much I will invest in BTC as of today its not much, . .so for now I am going with the wife, . But I will be using BTC when and where I can, . I think ill up the ante though . . But she (the wife) had excellent questions, Definitely not dishin the wife. .

@_date: 2017-02-26 15:51:17
Yeah I was thinking that about last night, Too bad someone can't come up with a system that has a better potential of not being taken over by financial systems and national interests, I kinda wish the people worldwide would own their own currency,  I wonder what percentage of this, the individual actually owns compared to the bigger entities. And who had controlling shares,. If China does.they don't seem to be able to sway the price that much,, unless you believe they are,. So I guess a future possibility if this ETF goes though, It could become an ETF on the U.S. stock market that a nation like China could at whim control the price fluctuations, . I whole separate thread I suppose, . . All I know is if this goes through, I will be selling my BTC holdings at some point and putting those assets into physical gold, silver, and food supplies

A non IRS but easier to read web page that explains bitcoin taxes . . 
Basically if you are buying and selling BTC for gains and losses within the market, and you are doing it with U.S. dollars within the U.S. You record your buys and sells at the time of transaction BTC/USD rate. made through online exchanges, (on the street, ATM, etc.) and at the end of the year figure out your total of those transactions in USD equivalent. This is your total gain or loss and report it on this IRS 1040 tax form.  the intructions are here, 
If you use BTC in conducting business within the U.S. or mine BTC within the U.S. then there are other forms to show income,loss on your tax forms. (see the above links for more info on those),

So if as an example, if BTC falls to a floor of 500 on an ETF denial, (not saying it will happen, just an example) and alot of BTC investors have a sell order at 1200 and below. (you can see how fast BTC can drop) Then the online exchanges will in effect become BTC heavy and be very light on cash holdings from cashing out investors?

I think it is possible, there are so many people into btc on pure speculation and emotional attachment right now, that if a big downturn begins, it could start a cascade effect, dropping down to your 200 level.
  Where I disagree with others is that I believe in such an event as this, online exchanges will not have the liquidity to cover even half this exiting to USD and the system couldl collapse a little before the 200 mark due to the lack of liquidity,. But that's just imo

An excellent question, if I remember right it had to do with either ongoing and outgoing chain transactions or inner coinbase, I should be able to control incoming myself from the source (such as sending with mycelium ) and I always use normal mining fees, never high.

I remember when I first got into BTC. I only bought $10 and moved $5 around to see how the system worked and to see where the fees were and if I could then again cash out. Nothing wrong with doing this. If y,all want to trash the new guys getting into the system. Don,t start crying when your price stops climbing up.

yeah, I'm looking into my bank fees today, and then googling the best way to minimize this fee if any, If I continue to believe in the BTC system I will probably search out a bank which has the best fees for an account to what I am doing and open a single account at a local branch just for this purpose. I know its alot to think about, but one way to maximize profits or minimize losses is to cut as many corners as possible. I like Coinbase so far because its a phone app and I am on the road alot. and its very simple and easy to use. so far I have never had any prob;ems with held up chain transactions or my money not being where it ought to be.I can buy and immediately move to cold storage in minutes, the only problem is moving it back I have to use Cold storage &gt; Mycelium &gt; Coinbase &gt; Bank. Which is why the fees are concerning me every time I move things around I get hit on all sides.

What about selling and transferring to cash back to your bank?, I seeing people more and more say that buying is incurring extremely high international fees, As it stands I can't make a trade through them untill someone sorts this out.

 Is it only wire transfers?, Debit transaction, bank transfers?, Purchase side only?, Selling side?  , Sure would like to see this forum answer the question specifically without just saying "coinbase sucks" or "try so and so" I use coinbase and it works for me, but I won't continue till this is solved

 I'm just saying you could carry just an emergency public key somewhere that links to an offline source of yours at home. No reason to keep both keys with you, just even half a paper bill that links to your dump at home, just for when you are on the road away from home. Perhaps if you meet someone on the fly selling BTC, If you think the market is shaky, for whatever. Sort of a totally offline BTC dump to a (home or safe deposit box) cold storage address. For whatever reason. It can't hurt to carry a few public QR codes with you on paper or whatever.  I personally carry five empty address/key with me wherever I go, I can transfer any funds funds offline immediately on the go where ever I am. And I don't keep keys on my phone, people keep telling me phones are not secure. And I keep telling them I agree.

A Bitcoin address has 2 keys, private and public, just remember your BTC address and keys should be generated offline and your private key should never see the light of day on a data or Internet connected device, Once you are ready to spend from your address and it goes online, spend the entire amount and empty the address, then never use that address again, , but after you use them they are worthless. Save them all just in case a glitch throws money in it,  Save the ones that have 17 cents in it, (you never know) That's why I use many separate addresses. Some of my paper wallets have small amounts for trading or purchasing my beer. (Then thrown away, but save a copy in the trash can), Others I have much larger amounts on for deep cold storage and I rarely use those. They sit in a safe deposit box. The nice thing about these is if I have the public QR, and the private has never seen the light of day, I can walk around with my public and immediately transfer BTC into my safe deposit box. Because no one has ever seen my private key

Or finding a Bitcoin exchange located in the u.s. would be better, apparently coinbase is now UK based, as it stands buying and moving Bitcoin is costing me more and more every time I blink. It's to the point where it's just not feasable anymore to buy and sell BTC. And I don't want to keep giving my bank info out online to exchange after exchange because none of them are stable. Don't have a problem with fiat, just cash my check and put it in my wallet, buy gold and silver to fight inflation. BTC at first seemed a good investment, but I'm not going to chase around exchanges while they change their systems and take the consumer for a ride without any oversight. I have better things to do.

 the mouse input , with offline **bitaddress**  my offline handheld takes forever generating a random address ,using pre installed "opera mini" saved for offline use. To generate QR it uses finger screen input,(alot of finger punching)  With bitaddress, , however  bitcoinpaperwallet, is 10,000 percent faster, it allows me to drag a finger on the screen as input as well as tap, this alone turned 30 minutes from bitaddress into 1 minute with your program. It also displays the "print paper wallet" screen quickly and with excellent graphics,  I wish the print button was a save to file, For that completed qr paper wallet template , so I could put the finished generated paper wallet on the sd card or usb for later instead of printing. Its the only thing stopping me at this point, I just down loaded the Zip, and am starting to try it, I want a  "save to file" for the completed template., I can then move that file to sd card for backup.and the whole thing works,  I have 2 way QR capabilities already and QR camera scanning already on the device. I use it alot your program works exponentially better than what I had. Anyways you asked me to let you know how it works, . . real well so far,. . .  How can I save a template to file?

I use coinbase, signed up using only a debit card, (3.99% debit to coinbase fee) my bank doesn't care, shows up on my bank ledger as a debit from coinbase. Appears as BTC in my coinbase wallet once it goes through. At the beginning of the process coinbase will nly let you transfer small amounts from your bank. after time the amount that you can use from you bank goes up. I even cancelled my debit card from their system and added a different account/debit card instead from the same bank and I retained my higher withdraw limit in the process. As far as charges from your local bank on debit withdraw fees I would ask them, you dont have to mention coinbase, just tell them its from a online business and they will be withdrawing funds from your card.  If you are willing to wait a week for it to go through you can also directly connect your account to coinbase without the debit and coinbase's fee will only be 1.99%

I use an app on my phone called Bitcoin balance when I send BTC From coinbase to my cold wallet, Just scan the public code with Bitcoin balance and save and label it
  Then when you do the transfer from coinbase Coinbase will say pending, and it usually shows up on my phone app before coinbase affirms it

Excellent comparison to coinbase! , but people lose money and the exchange itself needs to get their sh*t together. But I think the free market if left alone will teach coinbase that they need userbase.

As far as fees,  this is another subject,  using bitcoin in lets say the distant future.  Every time I purchase a hamburger,  I pay a mining fee,  Every time I place it in an account,  another fee,  then to buy groceries and pay for it with btc,  another mining fee,  I now equate mining fees with taxes every time i move my money,  with cash i dont get charged every time my money changes balances.  Or even with the bank.  I can place money all day in and out without a charge each time.  It is begging to look like btc can not handle a month of my activity without over charging what the banks cost me.

Didnt read the whitepaper lately,  need to do it again I suppose,  Dont remember if anti inflationary was part of the proposal.  But it seemed during this fork idea.

I'm not sure if they save them to your phone or on their own system, I generate my addresses totally offline and keep my own orivatly generated keys myself, If I ever upload my private keys online, such as onto Mycellium or coinbase, I then empty that address, usually by importing and moving the funds, I then place that empty address into a no longer used pile I have to no longer be used, And generate a new address with new keys offline. I have never kept any funds in an address in which the private key has been exposed to an online source, whether a pc, laptop, or on;line phone. All my funds are currently kept in an address that has never seen or touched (no matter how well hidden or encrypted) any device that ic connected to an online source,

Deadlycalculator, Its a heavy project for someone unfamiliar with the Linux OS, but not impossible. I personally have been into computers since the days before Microsoft ever came to be and I built my own 386 pc way back then.Linux is basically like having to learn a new widows operating system. . . . But when your done its more secure. There is a reason a lot of companies use a Linux type system and not microsoft. Anyways. I can help you as much as I can with a linux USB. If you have any questions feel free to ask. A note on security. Using bitcoin I never have used any encryption or anything for my addresses. Nor have I used any hardware wallets for BTC Understanding the near infinite number of addresses and its security implications has helped in this. I always wonder when people talk about losing their seeds and such to their wallets, getting hacked, losing money on exchanges, etc. I have never had this problem and I even show my public keys freely. All I have ever done is generate simple addresses offline and keep those addresses in backup in two places in my private home. No one has been able to hack me nor have I lost anything,  That said. I dont disagree with those other methods. I just chose the easiest most secure route for me and my skills.  Concerning a linux USB. It can be thought of as a non writable CD which contains a single operating system entity called an iso. Just like the cd you buy at a store  A linux ISO can not be written onto. . So you go online and find a Linux version (and their are many) that you like. I use "Mint" and write it onto a USB, these distros are usually free for download from the Linux community.  These Linux distros are what they call open source which means everyone knows and can see the final operating system program inside and out which keeps viruses and maleware out as long as you have the authorized version which can be checked after downloading from a reliable linux source. (unlike microsoft). As a matter of fact the double USB way of getting onto a pc and saving data is the way Edward Snowden protected his info while doing his deed, (I am not for or against this guy, its just a fact I learned after the fact of my travels) Anyway . the USB you can create contains a complete operating system on it much like your computer. And when you first boot your computer. On the pc screen at startup you get into what was once called CMOS, (not sure if it still is.  It usually prompts you to press a key during booting to enter CMOS, it does this at startup before the regular operating system boots. You then enter cmos and tell it not to recognize the existing hard disk within the pc and boot off the linux USB iso instead, Presto. you have an operating system running off a usb drive only which is unwritable except to a second USB.  and if you do not have any internet plugged in . there will be no trace of your actions after you shut down and remove the USB and not the pc. from there you can use an offline BTC address generator HTML such as bitcoinpaperwallet on the second offline USB to Generate BTC Addresses. Save this info, etc, Once done you can create a third USB that only contains the public keys and plug that online and share those. To use a private key, Simply transfer that key to a blank USB and import it to your online source. No exposure of your other private kets ever happens and you have no need to remember a seed, you simply have your own private list of addresses that can not be hacked. If you have any questions feel free to ask, An d I'll try to get the link for you in the next few days, . any way , the linux iso usb is one of the best ways to provide yourself with anonymity, security and leaving no trace of your actions on a pc.  It's an excellent way to secure your own private BTC funds in your own private world without exposing your keys online

I use a controversial methode that works for me,  bit since its homegrown few people understand its advantages. If you are curious look at my reddit profile from the very first post i made about bricking a phone into a totally offline address generator that sends information through a qr code screen display.  An accepted way of doing what you ask is to create a non writeable usb linux boot disk and use a second usb to store and create backups of you keys. This is done via downloading an open source web page at bitcoinpaperwallet and saving its html offline on your second usb.  I have further info about a linux usb system on you tube.

I personally want my local fiat, its the credit cards, banking fees, checks, etc. I want to avoid. Right now I prefer cash transactions the most for managing day to day funds,   Crypto will be second wayyy before banks and their fees and need for personal information that they dont need. ,but for now crypto is second and falling back because everytime i buy a burger or a jug of milk at a grocery store with crypto, i get taxed in the form of a huge mining fee attached on every small transaction. Basically every time i would make a small $3 purchase, and from my $30,  I would need to make these simple purchases at least 10 times a day always. Every time my money is moved i get a fee. and will mining fees go up in the next few years?  So for me, its cash first, BTC second simply for its promise of no banking institutions,  and at the last bit I avoid financial banking type institutions credit cards etc. as much as possible

 The phone can only be only rooted again from outside physical access to the device or through unsecured sd card once it has been built, The device itself can be password protected and encrypted without root availability from SD. Also this free open source program could be built upon new custom built hardware, Say sony or htc could build cell phone hardware without data transmitting hardware being there, They could use minimal hardware saving themselves money and time in producing the hardware with already existing factories. The open source program could be built upon that hardware specifically.. In order to trust the hardware manufacturer. The produced and usable devices could be publicly monitored for transmissions from concerned individuals with the correct monitoring equipment. Its still has a long way to go. But significant progress has been made. Personally I would like to see if a successful old phone root wipe and install can be successfully done always with the end users total security in mind. Linux and open source is a must for this project. And so far it has all fallen into place as if it was already made for it. I need now to gather together a group of individuals who would like to work the project.

It could be java free. and just work with an open source linux distro. I'm not pushing one coding more than another. Just looking for all possibilities for best ease of use and security, And an android app would work only if it roots wipes the entire software and install open source non android software in its place, Its an easy wipe and install, and could possible be done by downloading the correct android app made for this purpose. Only if it removes android completely from the phone. It could also do the wipe and install from a pre programed SD card given out freely or near freely from open source. That would be the best route rather than an app

You need to learn what a linux root wipe of the old existing software and new distro install is before saying something like that. It would make it easy to install, easy to use. and just as secure as any means available today. Did I mention I have never used a pc or laptop to trade or secure my bitcoin, Did I mention the entire setup is stand alone hand held, and portable so you can take it fishing with you and create addresses, trade, and store Bitcoin on the fly.  Did I mention that a small easy accessible and free open source program to install on older existing hardware to create this hand held device would make Bitcoin trading for alot of people safe, secure, and easier to manage, that this would increase the populations availability, and in turn secure the stabilty and rise the price of bitcoin substantially for anyone hodling before hand. Did I mention I have been using this device stand alone and given massive explanation and documentation online in various forums. Did I mention that the record of its perfect record of transactions has already been logged on both the BTC and ETH blockchains.

since it would be on the open source community, different distros from a small beginning distro , such as an added internal spreadsheet profit loss calculator, etc. Designed for personal use as desired, one designed for extra security encryption, another distro aimed at printing quality paper wallets. you could use the devices camera capabilities for paper wallet background images. But yeah the beginning basic open source root install program as you siad would be, . . 
Example : 1. User generates wallet with private and public key on phone 2. User has Bitcoin, transfers BTC to offline wallet 3. User has wallet stored in SD card and pulls it out, . . 
, . . with simple barcode qr scanning capabilities through devices existing camera and full screen display of QR codes as well.. . 
This feature lets me sit in a city park and move funds from BTC currently being on an online exchange to sd cold storage or vice versa - I do it all the time, easily, quickly, and efficiently. using the devices screen and my phone through Coinbase and Mycellium. 
If the market begins to crash. I dont need to seek out a home pc or laptop. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:54:09
that is correct.  i thought i saw somewhere where you could  root and wipe a phone and put a linux desktop on it. a small distro, thats what i would envision here.root install from the ground up so the devices software is unaware it even has data transmitting capabilities exist. the other reason for a linux kernal is that linux goes on older equipment such as pc's and laptops so damn well. and this is an older phone in excellent working order. it would seem in line with root, wipe, install. The linux kernal allows you all root privileges

There is a near infinite number of addresses, so accidentally reused by some one else, unlikely, reused by me the owner, if i have an donate address. How do I take money off it once in a while to release funds yet keep the public code an option after releaseing the private key, i would have a program that monitors the address and every time a balance increases, automatically execute the transaction to a second address that i have retained the private key, In this instance i want to re-use the address. But in that instance you would have to be able to beat the other guy, If the address had an execute priority to my public address or addresses first, . . . . That said, most all my addresses are one time use only regarding the private key. once I have uploaded the private key, that address goes into a burn pile folder.

 That would lead to the question, have they patched it?, does it work?, or beyond ethereum,  can a better suited blockchain in theory be built and tailored better for the application and  wouldn't an open source blockchain ensure the code is executed as you expect? if not you run a separate address tailored by someone else, or even build one yourself from prior chains?

It would open up Bitcoin with secure offline storage to a vast number of people worldwide through portability, security, affordability, and ease of use. As this would be a free open source program people can use to help them not get ripped off in todays BTC environment.

 The major difference I have found is that I have never used a pc or laptop to generate addresses offline and put into cold storage on sd card. Its a totally stand alone generator. I can watch markets on my online cell phone while out fishing at the local pond or Sitting in the passenger seat of my car while my wife is driving,  and can sit there and generate addresses, upload btc to exchanges, and download back into cold storage. be done in minutes, and then go back to fishing or waiting in traffic. I have used this alot on the fly and its always with me when i want it.   One of the major differences or advantages is not having to find a laptop or PC, ever, Throughout my bitcoin adventures,  I have always been carrying a small amount of BTC wherever I go with my own small portable wallet which has been awesome. Plus it works cross platform with almost all online exchanges without needing an online secondary system, Also the devices original hardware resources for all additional programming is in itself outstanding when compared to todays trezor device, This extended hardware capability allows for specified user programs on the device to be installed like book keeping ledgers and personal customized paper wallet creation.  It has convenience through portability.

I understand peoples concerns, yet you plug your trezor into IBM/Intel hardware with bill gates microsoft software. and bither goes onto an active online android device,  At some point the unsubstantiated fears have to give into reality, when someone actually describes how a clean wiped crippled old phone can transmit, and through what means, its all unsubstantiated fear without documentation. I would love to work on this with any open source people including trezor. I looked into bither at one point a while back and didn't choose that application either for whatever reason. Did I mention I have never used a pc or laptop to generate addresses offline and put into cold storage on sd card, . The sd card by itself cant transmit data either, unless you know how.

or if you prefer, an airgapped  "handheld" portable off line open source computer which you plug an even more downsized version of a trezor into, SD card , all encrypted of course, a portable offline computer of its own , you dont need a clunky pc. . a small handheld can have a nice screen with a user friendly gui as noted earlier. not only would it make it more easy and accessible. but also very secure down to the user level, . as long as you know you seed, its all in cold storage with automated backup and created in open source

Its one of many things. I like Gold, Silver, Cash, Stocks, BTC, Altcoins, Bicycles, whatever. I did some wandering around the internet the other day and i found a general  article on bitcoin on a gold peoples site. I read the comments and they all were trashing bitcoin. (about 80%) then I found another article on general bitcoin but this time on a different type of site. The comments there were more question and answer type with very  little btc trashing (around 5%). Even in BTC communities some will bash altcoins etc. yet in a zcash community the opinion of altcoins will be completely different. to me gold is just another asset that has potential to hedge inflation and be used as a secondary monetary system if the current fails. Although I think gold would be a bad emergency choice. also you have to look globally. people in idia like gold. countries use it as well. I believe if you get on a good track or get lucky you can make excellent money in ico's. but lots of people wont be so lucky either. Pick the right ico. But hold a little gold. If the whole blockchain idea comes to naught eventually or suddenly, at least you still have several positions to fall back on, . You could even as a trading strategy trade for or  against a spread of gold using both to transfer back and forth moving from gold to crypto and back to gold, I believe there may even be a gold backed altcoin. not sure. . .

@_date: 2017-09-06 15:52:03
I started with the whitepaper and its aspects when i first started, I do get it. I was however relating the purpose of btc to the entire rest of the crypto world and its coins. (not crypto purpose) There are other coins which do these things you mentioned better or as well as btc.
 It seems right now that as other new coins show up in the system. some with strong followings. That the market caps will change and people will naturally gravitate towards the coins they can use. This will change the crypto market especially with a few years time.which is my interest as a long term investor.  For a coin to succeed in this environment. it must have something. Just having a legacy will only last so long as others are building legacy too. and some of these coins can be used within the crypto system for real purposes. A global easily used currency by the masses. A patent chain. a corporate contact chain. the possibilities with a new technology are near endless.  BTC's only advantage right now in the market place is its ability to cross many platforms as i see it.. .  It is not a global easily used currency as the cost and ease of use is not there for my every day hamburger buy. There are those who say wait hold onto it and it will be. But the time i am looking at for btc to over come these hurdles and the rate at which new coins are being made and gaining ground. I would not invest in btc for this purpose. As I watch the markets.. .  BTC is being used and bought by individuals at this time for its cross platform exchange ability and simple investment speculation. If it loses this leading role in crossing platforms, and does not lead in any other value other than market cap . I believe it will lose its leadership role. At that point,  I see no other use for it above any other coin. And as of today,Ltc seems to be cheaper, faster, and gaining momentum for that moving funds cross platform use. I see BTC being eventually replaced through the passage of time by LTC or another upcoming crypto and BTC losing its market cap advantage through lack of cross coin advantage and use. I believe if it does not hold its leadership,  it will then slowly erode in the next  5 to 10 years time giving rise to new coins that may eventually reside on top of the market cap mountain. While BTC slowly through the next few years erodes and falls to a simple historical legacy and nothing more. time will tell
Which brings me back to its purpose. If BTC can keep its usefulness, Its to the moon in a big way. But,  If it loses all advantage of purpose amongst the others. BTC and Its legacy will be a good read in history books.

if you wish to persist, and as only a suggestion. Perhaps the mathematical structure (which is a simple computer math equation) listed on the original bitcoin whitepaper with a short ending explanation of its  reaching implications in the real world. . I believe that equation itself is easy to understand and runs on a computer logic/math type equation. It would work for an intro to cryptocurrency paper . . not a clue on the mine plan what to do. Personally I would do that in my off time if the teacher is nixing it. . doesnt mean it cant be looked into though in your private time. . Know this.

Can it be a global sentient agency of beings, universal?, how about decentralized. Can you have a decentralized universal consciousness that controls purpose, or is it simply monotheistic structure. hmm. could a centralized sentient being create with purpose a universal sentient decentralized agency of beings who while being emmensly seperated all are commuted to purpose without being aware of their total eclectic sentience and end purpose? , please define sentient. because if you do not consider plants sentient I will immediately disagree with your ideal out of misunderstanding. But if you do then I am fine with it. . . now is BTC sentient. Or a tool made and use by the suntients for its purpose we are unaware of?. . That was fun, wish I could talk more on this forum about,  biology,  A.I. , psychology, brain functions,  consciousness, fields, dimensions. . but this is bitcoin. And I do bellieve it has a purpose. We may have not really found it yet, maybe it was simply to start a crypto revolution as a starting stepping stone. who knows
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:22:38
I do not believe it will be the next currency. to many hurdles to overcome with to many new blockchains with new rules showing up every day. BTC is too slow going in the viable currency world. It could however lead and keep its market cap if it uses this wisely for other means. Eventually if everything continues. I think credit cards will have their own blockchain system made especially for that. so will other modes of currency exchange and use.

I am king at cell phone wallets. been doing it for over 7 months now. look at username eclecticuniversalas on youtube, also the same username here. then there is weebly.com under coldcrypto. I have reached a decision at this point that the phone after being bricked is a rom only device and retains no memory after shutdown. The external sd card (you want a phone with this) is basically a trezor or nano type setup with encryption. you back up to encrypted sd's and once satisfied remove the sd and shut off the phone returning it to ots original state. The handheld portable hardware device  in essence becomes an airgapped computer with qr code screen display. and the sd cards are the wallet programs like trezor or whatever. . . i will be uploading a new youtube video today or tomorrow showing my progress to date, and a fresh brand new out of the box device usage to tranfser btc bought on coinbase to cold storage on sd which can then be backed up or printed onto paper wallet.

I still have a btc/bch pre fork hodl that has sentimental value. originally was $70, . now with both coins almost at $400. It was one of the first cold storage dumps I did on my personally built portable hand generator. I will hodl it for near forever whether btc goes to zero or to the moon. nothing wrong with holdling. If I had spent it It would have produced a value of $70. If i had spent it and let it go, it wouldnt be an original pre fork hodl, I also desire to collect coins. I also have some btc liquidity in coinbase I use to day trade and spend. Its kinda like i do with money. some in a saving account or investment. some to spend. Absolutely nothing wrong with hodling or spending in my book

This is why long term I think Global BTC would work if local fiat systems (japan, Venezuela, etc) still exist at a local level. then if channels are left free for both sides, individuals could flee and save assets and the global would be more stable for some, less for others. Otherwise I agree at a point it might fail. and if local fiat still existed, the global could jump back into fiat as demand and time frame would dictate.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:50:18
Bitcoin is deposited into an address or you can think of it as being put in and evelope. The addresses are already made so to speak. And there are near infinite addresses like the number of grains of sand in the universe. So you get ( or generate ) an address you can use for yourself ( the possibilities of so.eone else having or generating your address is near impossible. Once you have generated your address on an offline non Internet connected source. (So no one else can steal it) the address will have two keys, One key is a public key for putting Bitcoin into the address. This keys are a sequence of numbers and letters that can be represented as a QR code. You can give out your public key to anyone, all they can do is put money into the address. The second key is a private key. Never give this out or let it have access to an online computer. This key is for getting Bitcoin out of your address. You can put money into an address as many times as you like. When you use your private key to take money out. Always empty the entire address at once. If you are moving it around. Simply generate new addresses offline. Then once you empty the first address, you can put the remaining Bitcoin leftover after you have done what you want into a new address. I would practice this before buying your first Bitcoins . Bitcoins can be purchased with Fiat money through online exchanges. Never leave your Bitcoin sitting in an online exchange, they own and control the private keys and many people have lost money due to failing and hacked exchanges. I used to use coinbase to purchase Bitcoin with dollars. Look around and ask, there are many exchanges, they will need your bank account info, I used an app on my phone called mycelium to upload my private keys to do exchanges and redirect my BTC as well, then it went back into a private address I newly made. Mycelium works well, ask around. Always keep your Bitcoin in cold storage (an address with a never published private key, and never leave it anywhere online
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:41:14
My cold storage btc have a private key that has never seen the light of day on an online computer nor are they kept in someone else's wallet needing to connect to an online device. Its all totally offline and never has been seen. my coinbase account is now and usually is 0.0.0 . Its always empty because its so easy to transfer to cold storage. Very good advice! and probably one of the most overlooked for a lot of people. Always control and generate your private keys, and never connect a device that manages those keys to an unsecured online computer ever. Keep your personal keys offline always, and keep your money safe
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:16:21
Programs like mycelium allow you to upload your private key and keep funds online. But if you are just holding, why upload your address online? Your just exposing your private key. If you are going to trade, make a new address offline, never on an online connected source. Then import your address to mycelium, do your trades, then use mycelium again to transfer remaining funds back onto a private offline address for storage, never leave your funds on an online source for very long, the always offline private key is your key to security while holding funds
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:57:41

Once you have the private key, and it has never touched an online computer, you can save this address however you want, you can write it down yourself on paper, save it to a couple SD cards for backups, put it in a safe deposit box whatever. All you need is a private key that is securely only for your eyes, it will stay there as long as no one has seen it

ease of use, people losing money due to so many scams,  methods that tie a person to a laptop, waiting 10 minutes for a transaction to go through, etc. are just some of the main reasons why btc isn't mainstream. If I hadnt been using open source linux for 30 years and already knew how to create a boot iso on usb, i never would have started buying bitcoin. It was just too much to do and learn, besides im tired of sitting in front of a computer. I hate doing that.  My first thought was , oh hell no, im not sitting in front of a computer again to do this. so i solved my problem, made it easy and portable without a pc, now I dont mind trading in bitcoin at all. But I was already into self computer security and offline hiding and discretion of information that was private. Hence the linux iso usb.  so until mainstream technology makes it easy and portable with quick transactions it wont be a good use for every day purchases.   but all this bottleneck in the system will be solved in time. give it a little time. As it stand right now, i wouldn't use BTC for a large percent of my business until it gets more mainstream. Which might take a few years. just imo.

, If you have to monkey with the existing block chain to make it work properly and keep it viable,  Then the satoshi paper was not a miracle end all to our financial system problems,  Nor,  once a small number of people begin making changing decisions on the nature of an existing block chain. One in which people are currently using.  Can it ever be considered totally decentralized.   For Goodness sake, If you think the current block chain is problematic. Make a new coin,  If it works people will gravitate there.   Apparently,  once the need arises to test a better system because someone thought they saw problems.  We alter the one everyone is using. And when we alter it.  SOMEONE is making these decisions.  And this is no longer a decentralized non outside controlled system. Although its core process is decentralized the outer management creating change isnt. I challenge those who want to change BTC.  To make a new blockchain and new coin with the changes and see how popular it is. Hey they made litecoin.   If your BTC block chain alterations are all that and a bag of chips,  what have you got to lose. Your destiny awaits.  And If BTC becomes unbearable as you say it will,  At that time people will move into your better coin,  Just like a free market ought to.  But if you are altering the blockchain people are using,  Im sorry,  but the monetary system you want me to get into,  Is not a decentralized system with decentralized management. And it cures non of the ills it proposes to. This goes for all coins,  Ethereum,  Monero, BTC,  etc. Just imo,  But I will never feel secure putting all my money in a system in which people can monkey with,  Apparently at that point.  Its not the perfect solution I was hoping for.

After my initial investment,  i later took out my initial investment plus a small profit for myself,  and left the remainder in cold storage hodl. That way if the whole system crashes i still made a slight profit,  and my hodl was essentially free and sitting in invstment

id just like to pay my taxes on it now, let it sit for five years until i retire, and was wondering how it would fit into that scheme on an ira. I dont want to pay taxes later, I just want my money. if altcoins survive that long. I think they will.

I wouldnt do it,   i would always be wondering in the back of my mind about the security of my funds and be changing the address every so often out of uncertainty and a fear of losing my assets,.  All my funds are on an address that has never touched anything online. It sits there for a very long time and I have no questions about anyone ever knowing my address,  I just like the knowing where it is and that no one can ever access it unless they physically steal the address from its hiding spot.  The piece of mind is priceless
