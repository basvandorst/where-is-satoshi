Do you think this is potentially fake?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:12:11
I 100% have the same issue.  So I believe the OP.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:12:50
I have the same issue...going on 20 days now.  To see that you still have this issue outstanding is horrifying to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:06:38
It was automated, so I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:42
No problem, thanks for looking it.  it is confirmed to be just a mailing address now.

Coinbase doesn't have all the alt pairs...in fact it only has BTC, LTC and ETH.

Bittrex has worked perfectly for over a year for me.  I'm not someone who has just signed up.

As Steve said, it has helped a few others in the same situation as me to post the amount and support ticket, the thread picked up steam and the problem was solved within a day.  It helps posts get noticed, but based on how others are responding to this thread, it is probably best to remove it.  I appreciate your advice.

Very helpful, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:07:33
Good luck to you as well!  Keep me in the loop, I am contemplating filing a class action.

I have an attorney that is on hand to draft a Legal Demand Letter right now.
Exactly, the comfort here for me is that they are a US entity.  So their should be some legal recourse if this doesn't get fixed soon.

Hey Steve - thanks for all the help and support.  I noticed that too, but based on how people are behaving in this thread, it is best to probably remove it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:22:49
Hey!  Good to see you in here.  Bittrex worked great for me the last year as well, first time having to deal with support or lack thereof.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:30:35
Most others who have gotten it fixed, post it in the thread.  But there's a lot of negativity in here, so I will be cautious and remove it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:51:04
That would be highly appreciated

I am worried because they have not responded to any customer service tickets in over 20 days.  I recognize that I made an error, but that should not mean they should be able to keep my money.  
I time to time have that much on an exchange for liquidity in short term trades.  It is just unfortunate I got locked up during that time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:05:38
I followed the support ticket instructions and submitted the ID picture with a piece of paper with writing of the date and the word bittrex.   Unfortunately, no one has responded in 20 days.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:29:22
Still pretty inexcusable especially for a "money" handling institution.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:03:16
From time to time I will have this much in during short term trades, unfortunately it got locked during one of these times.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:57
It was an old account I started a long time ago and forgot about.  I also don't believe it was specifically stated as against the rules back then. 
Businesses often times have separate accounts in order to keep accounting silod.  In any event I should have been more careful to understand this space.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:51:09
Thank you, really appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:49:10
appreciate the insight, you are right.  Need to change.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:35:38
Do you have a link?  
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:05:12
Thank you Steve, i will give that a try.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:08:27
Sometimes I will do a short term trade if I see an opportunity.  Unfortunately I got locked during one of these times.

Where's the CBOE BTC ETF?
