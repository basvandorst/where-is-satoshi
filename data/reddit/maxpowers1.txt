I am very surprised people still deal with MtGox.
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:51:03
I'm interested.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:32:23
I would be interested if not for that suspicious "Lol" at the end.

I've been holding on to 10 bitcoins I mined 6 years ago. If I understand this correctly - transferring my 10 bitcoins to my kraken account will result in my account having 10 bitcoins and 10 bitcoin cash after the fork?
Assuming I can actually transfer my coins in time and aside from Kraken dying or other similar event restricting access or control over my coins, why wouldn't I want to do this?
Also, I'm not informed of the technical details of crypo currency forking, so is this a technically possible result? I can't imagine an exchange crediting accounts if it costs them.

I am not too familiar with LTC mining. I've only dabbled a little with LTC pools but I know that the mining method they use is much more resource intensive than BTC mining.
The reason BTC mining with a PC pays so little is because of ASIC computers, and ASIC computers can't mine LTC (or maybe they are so bad at that it's not worth it)
For this reason, *I think* mining LTC with a CPU or video card is better in the end than mining BTC with the same hardware.

You are right of course.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:05:30
But that wouldn't sound patronizing enough.

Back in 2011 I was mining with my shitty HD 4850 and making about 2 BTC a month.
I only collected 10 BTC though. Oh well.

I'm glad to see you replied quickly, before this guy could scam donations out of people.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:58:52
He does not.

I've purchased digital goods like Steam games before with Bitcoin, but this is the first time I buy an actual physical product.
I bought a $75 Amazon gift card on Gyft (which took all of 2 minutes from start to finish) using 0.7804 BTC from the 10 BTC I mined years ago. It's really awesome.
[Stuff I bought]( for the curious.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:40:46
I see, so it's not sensationalist. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:39:25
Hypothetically... suppose I transferred my 10 BTC I mined over the years to my mtgox account while they were at 200.00 USD per BTC.
I sold all 10 and had a balance of 2,000.00 USD on my mtgox account.
A day later, BTC dropped down to $100 and I bought 20 BTC with the 2,000 USD balance on my account, leaving me with a balance of 0.00 USD.
Would I be in trouble with the tax man?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:21:02
Well, sorry but you wouldn't have saved me and I'm pretty sure many others...
I'd transfer the Bitcoin only when I'd have the item in my hand and/or at least seen it in action in person.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:35:45
Lying is bad. Scammers are bad.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:07:10
Your username really ties this comment together.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:02:03
Can ASIC Bitcoin miners be modified to perform work other than Bitcoin mining? Say... SETI or Folding computing?
If so, that would be a perfect example of how technology can be improved where there is profit involved.

Announcing this is probably more harmful and embarrassing to the company than not announcing it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:24:09
The alternative is a work around of death.
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:48:10
Doctah peppa
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:21:56
No prob. Good luck with your mining!
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:19:09
Yea, let's just focus on stabilizing BTC at 10 cents each. They'd be stable!
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:39:29
34 pounds of meat with 1 Bitcoin.. wow.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:28:09
So you admit this thread has a sensationalist title.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:41:30
I seriously wonder how rich that alpaca sock business owner is now. Maybe he hoarded all the BTC payments he received when alpaca socks were the only thing you could buy with BTC.
Back then I'm sure it was probably *at least* 20 BTC per pair of socks.

I only have 10 Bitcoins I mined a few years ago but I decided I'm going to store them for 5 years. Whatever they are worth in 2018, I will use them to buy products or services, or maybe donate.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:18:23
I am so confused...
Is there a Redditor with some absurd amount of hashing power that switched from BTC Guild to 50BTC?
Or, is the 50BTC founder a Redditor?
Or was there a thread on Reddit warning of BTC Guild nearing the 50% hashing power mark and advocated switching to 50 BTC?
Not knowing the answer is bothering me a lot more than it should...
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:32
Hmm. I see. You mentioned you used a pool. 
To give you an example. I have two computers I use for mining.
I made a little experiment, over a 24 hour period. I mined BTC nonstop, which earned me about 0.01 BTC.
I did the same 24 hour period but mining LTC nonstop. That earned me about 0.22 LTC.
The hardware I use is one Radeon HD 5850 and one Radeon HD 6850.

Better than hearing about them when the first information on them came out and only the nerds in cryptography were interested. Then immediately (and stupidly) dismissing it without really thinking about it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:45:19
Probably close to nothing...
The design of the GeForce cards (few complex processors) is very badly optimizing for Bitcoin mining. The ATI cards (many simple processors) happens to be very good at it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:42:03
How so?
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:49:22
Damn. I chat on the troll box. I get all my coins out of there the moment I trade them though.. and deposit only right before making a trade.
