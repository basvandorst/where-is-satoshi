Makes for a much better present now. Would be disappointing to receive bitcoin as a gift only to watch it drop in value with a correction like this. Now everyone receiving bitcoin as a gift this year gets to watch it grow in value.

This right here is technically the only way to be able to honestly say that one's bitcoin income is earned income instead of [unearned income](

Private banks are actually the ones creating most of the money supply, and they do it every time someone takes out a loan. Poof. Magic money out of 1s and 0s, right out of the ether.
Governments are only creating a small percentage of the money supply, like 3%. Private banks create 97% of it. Although the fact money can be used to pay taxes, is kind of a big deal as far as building trust in the currency itself.
I agree that bitcoin was a huge step toward decentralizing trust, but let's not pretend it's not the bankers that have been fucking us for millennia who are the ones looking down the barrel of technological disruption here.

The full quote is:


It's kind of important to not ignore that 2nd part. Here's what I mean:
If we look at households now and compare them to basic income, where everyone would be getting what is effectively a huge tax refund, of the size of $32,000 for a family of four, tax burdens are decreased for households earning less than around $185,000.
And that's just using a simple model based off a flat income tax. We don't have to do that. We can reduce income taxes across the board and shift to other methods of taxation, like VAT, FTT, LVT, carbon taxes, etc. I agree that we want to get away from income taxation, especially for the overwhelming majority of the population whose incomes are derived from hard work.
But those incomes at the top? Those largely aren't derived from hard work and are instead derived from owning capital, buying favorable laws, and rent. And the amount of it that has accumulated at the top and nowhere else just this century is kind of ridiculous.
