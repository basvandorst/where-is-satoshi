So, for a while the "going rate"  of bitcoin was  based on mtgox since it was the largest exchange. What are we going by now, if someone asks how much a bitcoin is with? I've been going by Coinbase since that is where I buy and sell them... But I wish they were listed on bitcoinity, I like their charts.

And there was much rejoicing

definitely shocked me for a second!
edit: liking the idea though, for sure.

Mt Gox and Coinbase are both not working for me, wow

Thanks for the tip. I bought now because the price has been going nuts lately (up almost $30 while waiting for my bank to link to my coinbase account), and I figured in the long term there's no better time to buy than now.

Looks like some noise on the monitor then some V-Fib before the flatline

I read somewhere Coinbase updates hourly, at right when the clock changed from 3:59 to 4:00 I clicked buy and it went through. Obviously this is anecdotal evidence, but it worked for me!

Plus, now that the price is higher there won't be as many people buying 100 at a time. Lowering the limit isn't really hurting anything.

Well we just hit $228 and $235 is not outside the realm of possibility if some largish orders come through again in the next half an hour

I just bought my first bitcoins (well, 1.5) at $94 and it dipped down *right after* i bought them! Ah well, it's not like I'm selling anytime soon, I expect them to be above where I bought in a few days, and long term even higher.
