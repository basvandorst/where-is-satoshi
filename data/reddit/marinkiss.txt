Pretty much the same but I myself wouldn't use such a service that had not resolved the two flaws described above.

Well, I guess I'll have to rebrand it for Spain :) But it needs to be as short as possible.

Yeah, I know this is not the right (and fair) word to describe Circle, but this is my overreaction for everybody's overreaction for Circle. And besides I needed a catchy title :)
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:39:38
This is only true if we agree that AOL is already very popular and widely spread among grannies :)
This is not the case with Circle. Why not educate your granny how to exchange bitcoins for fiat money instead of educating her to use some new web-based online banking system like Circle? It is just the same effort for her, isn't it?

I hope "broke" does not mean literally got them broke :)

The  benefit of bitcoin is that it keeps the greedy hands of your government off your money - no devaluation by inflation (seizure by printing cash), no bank account seizure, no assets declaration at borders, only indirect taxes determined by your consumption of goods (the only fair tax)

Wait to see what will happen once Circle becomes AOL of money!
Bitcoin will be pushed back and totally blurred. Average Joes won't give a shit if the platform uses bitcoin for swaps as long as their cash transfers to the desired location.
At the end of the day Joe will be using this quazi-bank in the same centralized way like before, and will know nothing about bitcoin and its concepts.

The UX war will be won when there is no need to exchange fiat money for btc, but when you get payed in btc.
If the merchant (who is already in our camp) start paying employees' salary in bitcoins (or at least part of the salary), then two problems will be solved - the merchant will stop making pressure on bitcoin price and there will be no need for the employee to convert fiat to bitcoin.
The fiat money as medium of exchange for bitcoins must fade out with a greater pace - this is the new war to fight for.

Coinjoin is not a real anonymizer.


@_date: 2014-12-21 13:44:55
It definitely can be done by a trading spot or an exchange site. After all, you can deposit cash to an exchange and get the bitcoins in a fresh anonymous address. But this involved several steps that you have to do, and it also involves fiat money, which is traceable.
My idea is more like instant anonymizer. Instruct the hub to pay to someone instead of you or to deposit bitcoins to a certain address within minutes thus breaking the link from your address to target address.

Bitmixer is very close to what I want to create as a service. I am testing it right now, but so far it looks really simple and tidy.

How come being anonymous breaks any laws?
You can hide your caller ID when calling to someone, and this is perfectly ok. Why not hiding your ID when sending a text to someone?

Zerocoin is cool but it involves the creation of a new protocol, which is far too complex, and will need the adoption of the bitcoin community from scratch.
The terms "obfuscating" that Zerocoin uses to describe anonymizing services is exactly what people need.
Computer nerds always tend to make things in a highly sophisticated way, and I am trying to figure out a way to cover up tx traces in the simplest way possible.

I agree. There was an option for a reply but to some extend it was compromising the anonymity so I removed it.
I now work on a feature for getting the replies with a unique url that you check regularly to see if you got a reply.

Recently I bought the domain name WhatIsBitcoin.com.
The question "What is Bitcoin?" is in top 5 search queries for Bitcoin for 2014.
I myself was also horrified by sites like bitcoin.org and the fact that information is so scattered and so technical... No wonder average Joes don't trust Bitcoin and think it is some kind of weird nerds' thing.
According to a study only 24% of Americans have heard about Bitcoin and of those 24% significant amount of people distrust, don't understand or believe in popular misconceptions about Bitcoin.
My plan is to build community based educational site that covers popular topics in plain and understandable words. My goal is to translate the site in all major languages in order to eliminate the language barrier. 
A faster Bitcoin adoption is co-related to the increasing number of people who understand it and allow it in their comfort zone.

I couldn't agree more!
If a merchant believes bitcoin price will rise in the next couple of months, he would be able to give 5% discount, collect the bitcoins now, and sell them in the future when the price increases to +5%. 
In fact, collecting bitcoins by marketing candies like discounts may turn out to be a good investment for the merchant.
And another good point for the merchant, accepting bitcoins with discounts is tax reduction. You don't have to declare your bitcoin turnover, and thus you can save taxes.

This software has the potential to be very disruptive. In some cases it could be of a great favor to the world, but in other cases it could start a war.
It is dangerous to play with fire!
And from technical point of view - I can't imagine how would the software prevent one document from not appearing twice on an auction.

Senator Paul Massicotte got it right why the couple married on the blockchain - so that the bedroom door opens only for the groom (in reference to Andreas airbnb example with the door opening only for the customer holding the blockchain key)
This made my day :D 
This video is awesome!

The term "mainstream" or "average Joe" is not there for nothing. If Joe was a visionary person, he wouldn't even need your advises on bitcoin.
An average non-technical and overall careless guy needs a reason to use bitcoin NOW, and not in the future.
If the bitcoin world does not give Joe any good reasons to join in, then bitcoin is doomed to be a nerds' thing only for very long time.

I agree that Circle will make it easier for anyone to use bitcoin. But this is the cheese in the mouse trap!
Any centralized system eventually gets corrupted. And this is so true for centralized systems solely created to deal with wealth!
We must not trade freedom for a couple of tiny comforts!

You sound like a Canadian :)
"I am getting a little bit upset" :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:36:39
You can't present a Bitcoin newbie things like Currency Stats &gt; Blocks mined, time between blocks etc.
This usually scares the shit out of any non-technical new comer!
If your grandmother does not understand you telling her what is Bitcoin then your explanation sucks big time!

Is there an option to switch off any of the marketplaces and leave only btce for example?
@_date: 2015-01-04 10:10:41
I call "skeptic" the friends of mine who crossed the line of thinking Bitcoin is a bubble. This is the first phase to be overcome - the denial phase. Then you become a skeptic :)
