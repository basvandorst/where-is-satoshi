Tell that to the people who spend thousands on shoes.
People like their fancy shit.

Let's take a step back, I think we've talked passed the point.
My objection was to this sentence:


I do not agree. Anecdotal evidence is worthless.
I will give you an example; my uncle's aunt's grandma's dog's owner's brother once got a 6 month suspension and $1 million locked away by the bad guys at paypal.
You would have to give my example as much credibility as any other anecdote to consistently fulfill the notion that anecdotes matter.
However, my example is bullshit, and should not be accepted as credible, just like the other unsubstantiated anecdotes before it.

I would argue that: today you wouldn't cite 2016's presidential polls as accurate "data".
In 2016 polls were overwhelmingly predicting a Clinton win in the US presidential elections. Google this. [Here's 1 example.](
Despite this, Trump is in office today.
["The plural of anecdote is not data".](
I think you actually agree with my position.

If you're going to make a claim like that, you better prove it.

You're incredibly nieve, such a shame.

You do agree your anecdote is irreverent? 
Or are you still trying to qualify it? I can't tell.
