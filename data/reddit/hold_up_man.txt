Many people have said "don't spend more than what you can afford to lose." That seems like good advice to me. 
You can buy anything you want with them. Right now, you might need an intermediary like Bitpay to do that, but that will certainly change in the future if more businesses begin to accept Bitcoins directly. 
Around here, most everyone believes in the future of Bitcoin and thus that its value will increase. BTC has global aspirations, it's incredibly easy to use, and it would relegate our current (corrupt, ineffectual) banking system to obsolescence.

How might Bitcoin begin to recruit price-insensitive users?

The Pirate Party appears to be friendly to bitcoin. I'm pretty sure that's the reason for the OP.

What am I looking at here? 
Bitcoin supports animal rights?

Nice work!

If large corporations begin to accept and integrate Bitcoin then the value will have difficulty staying under five figures (a few years down the road).
But Bitcoins are just fun as hell man. Get some, play with them, spend them. Save some, but don't worry too much about speculating - more and more vendors pop up everyday giving great deals to people paying in 'coins.

yeah cheers that's pretty fortunate.
i missed the $60 window myself, was still moving money around at the time.

The Internet is just so important isn't it?
Your post reminds me of this Falkvinge article I stumbled on last night while tuning into the election results:

Yeah I mean there's certainly some amount of risk involved. $100 though... I'd just toss that in and enjoy the ride - maybe you double your money in a week, maybe you lose 30 bucks. 
What I will say though, is if you lose the 30, don't immediately freak out and run back to USD or whatever. BTC is pretty resilient, it rises from the ashes of its defeats stronger than ever.

I don't mean to tell you what to do. That's just how I'm looking at things.

In terms of what goods and services may be exchanged for it, sure. I mean insensitive to its relationship with the USD and other fiat currencies.  
Most people who use USD aren't concerned with how their money translates to Swiss francs.

Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live, and let's change the way we treat each other.
Seriously though, Bitcoin's worth in developing countries is so important. Africa does matter for Bitcoin (for a whole lot of reasons), and I think your second statement points to why.

I could be wrong, but I doubt that a video game connection would help Bitcoins at this point. It would give people more opportunity to pidgeonhole them - from "Monopoly money" to "WoW money."
