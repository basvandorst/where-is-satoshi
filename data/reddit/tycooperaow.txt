Another question, would it serve as the catalyst to not only survive but restore the economy to a growing economy due to its financial capabilities and influence it has towards other crypto currency projects?

It's binance cryptocurrency that you can use much like any other currency, but Binance coin give better incentives if you use their coin on their exchange platform and use binance coin with some of their projects on Binance Dex

You are precisely correct.  Although in our current state between IBM,  Rigetti and Google there are about only 152 Qbits. So the power to breaking encryption is far future.  But more development will see to it! 
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:26:01
OMG THATS PERFECT!!  I LIKE THIS
@_date: 2018-08-31 04:05:01
Mining rules are immutable within the blockchain...  If you were were to change the rule you would have to fork the existing blockchain with new rules in place.

@_date: 2018-08-31 04:17:22
Precisely,  by the time quantum computing becomes this almighty computational beast,  there will be more breaking throughs in other computational avenues. These start ups are most likely are seriously behind on funding, and research development (probably it's great marketing is what's driving them and that really does entail a business success). For them to compete with Google, IBM,  Rigetti, and ION Q will be morally wishful thinking.  It'll be about 20 to 30 years before quantum computation becomes a threat to crypto economy.  Especially as resistors mentioned.  That encryption could potentially be quantum resistant.  It'll be complicated to execute and rely on wishful thinking and strength of quantum computation, because one QBit essentially has the processing speed of bit^2 per. What you could do is take advantage of quantum computation for data encryption. That'll be more secure because the contents would essentially in a superposition state and the variables and QHashes would consistently change from 1 or 0 until measured oppose to today encryption where it's fixed. The secure thing about Cryptocurrency and Blockchains are the users (nodes) that construct the decentralized severs and the long hashes of information that represents data that can proceessed and not capable of theft nor forgery.
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:06:48
That statement defeats itself.  As a business it doesn't matter what they want,  it always matters what people want!

Lol they will survive the decryption snap
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:32:20
In this case, I gave a tip in cash (more than the “expected”), plus an extra $10 worth of btc. If it goes up to $20k per coin, that’ll be a real handsome $80 tip.
So giving extra value, that’s supposed to be extra gracious and NON-mandatory (America), plus an extra-extra tip, that’s extra than normal, for something that has extra value to it...
I think it’s worth adding an extra knowledge. Even when I laid out instructions on doing so like ikea. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:56:18
Well, stealing cash takes a little more effort than just “looking” at it. 
Unless it’s a debit/credit card
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:16:36
Yes, I could see where you are coming from in the perspective of someone who’s not well versed with this idea (in this case, these people were). Bitcoin is a little different and can’t really be compared to most payment methods out there. Reason because bitcoin has more potential than most forms of payments. You know it’s both an asset and payment method, the more use cases of bitcoin or additional adoption is great for the grand scheme of things. 
The influence of bitcoin let alone brings more benefits for the less fortunate than meets the eye. This is one case and yes If they didn’t know what it was, I wouldn’t have tipped. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:11:29
Yes that would be great!
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:53:53
�� perfect answer 
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:54:59
I kinda got that from the numerous of other responses. This was something extra I added on, plus a $5 tip in cash. They liked bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:59:13
True, but the teaching or guiding factor was implied. I understand your frustration, but with understanding, comes acceptance.
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:37:34
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:27:40
I’ll send you a template in DM’s

Think Forward. ��
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:22:09
That’s cold af.
Why you shilling XRP��
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:25:40
I feel like half the people in a r/bitcoin subreddit are missing the point. The point is the introduction to bitcoin to somewho may not know what it’s already is.
Giving them a tips out of gratitude as an additional gift for both knowledge of bitcoin and adoption into learning more about future of currency. 
If you don’t use bitcoin in replacement of traditional cash mediums then it really does stagnants the growth of bitcoin adoption. This also shares the knowledge of it and instead of keeping it tightly closed, thus the value would diminish. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:20:07
It’s for building curiosity. You never know what people may be interested brah. Besides, eventually everyone will learn about it. 
So might as well start early.
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:44:12
Too true! Like that’s what r/buttcoin is for�� no worries man. I’m here in support for you. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:19:11
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:35:09
You work with finding money from randoms?
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:41:29
Yeah, this whole sub just blew it out of proportion.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:42:56
It was an simple example, yet the principles remain the same. It could be a check or stack of cash. Either way, those funds would have to be validated, and cleared out of ACH. Also most are sensitive to reversibility.
Most Coin-Fungible Cryptocurrencies and Tokens, have similar usage but you could withdraw those funds and accomplishes the same goal. Cash is limited by physical reach and tangiblity.
Crypto is digital and has a practically global reach than any other form of payment method. It’s faster than we have today and more secured. No middle man. No bank. 
Which is exactly what this subreddit is about. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:55:24
Fees are literally less than pennies... what are you on about...
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:36:29
Yes, obviously it has to be if you are here, in a r/bitcoin subreddit, and the value went up to $20k per coin...
And if it’s so damn great one if the biggest banks in the world is using its technology to make one of their own... I figure it’s wonderful.
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:01:13
Someone obviously hates bitcoin adoption.
You make it sound like I didn’t give them money in fiat as well. You jump to conclusion smuck. Stop getting so sensitive over everything. This sub doesn’t call for your sensitivity.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:15:29


But as [FantasticEchidna4]( stated.... Why would I make a donation, only to steal it later? It's not paying definitive good or service. It's literally meant as an extra optional tip.
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:51:47
My dude, I tip in cash as well. This was just something extra on top. Slow your roll. Crypto is the future. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:57:46
I laid out instructions on how to use it thoo. Why so hostile m8. Bitcoin is the future bra. It’s called adoption.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:47:43
That’s because you are going through a third party. Blockchain, and other platforms, I believe, do not account for that set up.
Let me ask you this, how do you open a checking account at your bank? What do you need to open it?
Oh wait, let me keep going. Once it’s open the bank still hold the power to: close, freeze, overdraft, stall, pend, restict, and straight up delete funds. And if that particular bank fails, good bye to your money lol.
You have to keep in mind, what if I gave someone $5 who DOESN’T have a bank account? Hmm the difference is that one is already set up. If someone already have a wallet set, then that would be seamless am I right?
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:32:01
But, For a donation tho? That’s literally money I wouldn’t care to have either way, either how. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:15:42

And three, I gave step by step instructions on what to do!
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:34:30
No,lol it’s the exact opposite ��
I’m GIVING out bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:18:36
Actually not at all. When I gave step-by-step instructions where a child could follow. There are so much support for bitcoin and resources where they won't get lost. In that aspects, its Rubix cube plus a tutorial guide on how to solve it. 
Crypto is the future. Plus I did tip in cash too. This was something extra. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:55:22
So half of these people in a r/Bitcoin subreddit totally missed the point and intentions of what I did.
I gave cash as a tip, but I gave extra in BTC so this was on top of what I already gave in cash.
The person there already knew what bitcoin was and had knowledge of it, so it was fine for me to leave it there. 
So those of you who think this is an asshole move, it wasn’t! This was provided by great intentions and to get others to learn more about bitcoin. Anything negative to state about that I’ll just have to say... 
WHY ARE YOU IN A r/Bitcoin SUBREDDIT!!?
@_date: 2019-03-10 06:19:21
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:53:51
The crypto climate, let alone the public attention of cryptocurrency, was significantly and drastically different from 2013 to now my friend. 
I can say is, that cryptocurrency will become extremely more valuable. In years to come. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:18:48
But in this case that’s not what’s happening.
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:54:21
I have too many business ideas. I’m seeking to off load some resources too, plus I love collaborating with others.
Send me a pm.
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:23:28
The keyword there is “strong”. Not all central governments are “strong”. Anything and everything is a niche, it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a global effect. 
Just because some thing is unique doesn’t always make it undermine. Bitcoin itself is no small business. When you have banks (like chase) and other big and small players creating ICO’s and startups tailored to all niches, and they were all influenced by Bitcoin, it’s definitely something more people would look into. 
If you don’t like Bitcoin, then I wouldn’t force my opinions or beliefs on you, but if the world starts changing and accepts it as modern usage, then my friend you’ll be left behind.
If you didn’t like bitcoin, you wouldn’t be in a r/bitcoin subreddit initiating this comment.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:54:55
Happy Cake day! 
@_date: 2019-03-24 02:16:44
Like I said, I paid in cash, but even still, this was an additional payment for them in bitcoin. You also missed the point that it's a tip jar and the guy there knew about bitcoin. 
So at the end of the day, this was completely justified. Why would I give a tip in bitcoin to someone who doesn't understand it. Even if they didn't and if they were open to learning about it then by all means.
So this is not a dick move. I just want to clarify that. You people missed the point entirely.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:16:14
Yeah, but it’s a good and unique and fun way to introduce and share crypto knowledge. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:59:18
This is why bitcoin education is necessary
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:52:13
No it’s not. The bitcoin was just something I added extra. I put $5 in cash. 
It’s supposed to be a cool idea 
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:14:52
Percisely, and the shop takes bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:31:03
I literally wrote down step-by-step instructions on the paper on how to help people with that. (For this particular case)
In the grand scheme of things, bitcoin will eventually become so common place that the literary of it would be common place. It’s the same with any technology.
You may not know how the iPhone or Android is build, but you use it everyday like clockwork. 
You may not know the name of every piece of a car, but you most likely drive and ride in one everyday.
Some maybe some minor education would be needed for anything, but there’s not a structure yet for people to learn it with bitcoin beyond the web.
This will be the case of bitcoin. Which is why startups, big corporations are hopping on the opportunity anyway they can because the potential is massive.
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:49:28
So I’m guessing you think ripple and crypto 226 billion dollar market cap doesn’t exist.
What do you mean I have no proof? You are in this sub and know about bitcoin. That proves it’s highly successful and climbing. Bitcoin devs are bringing out a lightning network which would reduce those fees.
That’s just shows you are miss informed, you pay a fee you your bank in so many ways. If anything you pay more to your bank than to anything in your life time. 
Although yes the blockchain potential is more interesting, you have to keep in mind it started with bitcoin and bitcoin will remain rising.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:09:53
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:40:18
Umm no. I already gave a cash tip... this was just something extra on top.
If no one claims it in 90 days then I’ll take the bitcoin back.
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:52:36
Yeah, lol but it's only supposed to be temporary, not a active recurrent use for a wallet. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:52:28
Lol sometimes even less��
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:05:41
Not all the time, but I would ask from time to time as a conversation starter.
Most people ask about my bitcoin phone case that I have and I’ll fill them in on it
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:39:59
But some people don’t even tip at all. 
I thought it be cool, and they thought it was cool as well. It may not resonate with everyone, but for someone who likes bitcoin then might as well actually use bitcoin for it’s intended purpose. Bitcoin is far more useful than just hodling.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:40:57
I asked if they knew bitcoin first, they indeed knew, and had a general knowledge in this case. So it wasn’t random. I asked first.
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:43:48
Umm getting others interested in bitcoin and thoroughly explaining it so they understand is always a good idea.
And with that attitude, WHY ARE YOU HERE IN A r/Bitcoin SUB REDDIT??? If you don’t care?
No one is pushing a pyramid scheme. This is literally free bitcoin/donation I’m giving out. 
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:27:57
no, Just your gender and age...

"Ahh that's hot. That's hot" 
@_date: 2019-03-24 12:57:22
It’s frustrating to say the least and I did tip in cash. There’s nothing wrong with this. This was an extra gift on top of what’s already supposed to be extra.
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:56:41
Haha Yup
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:30:06
Well, technically speaking they don’t have to much at all. Converting their funds from cash to digital form would take more time and resources than it would using a paper wallet:
You have to go to the bank. Deposit cash. Uses gas and need for transportation.
This however, you need the private and you could send it anywhere to any wallet to pay for anything. 
The issue is my pacman78 friend... is that most of the world doesn’t accept bitcoin or cryptocurrency as a form of payment.
The problem isn’t the player, it’s the game;)
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:13:57
And this is why we need Blockchain technology. Thus reinforcing the education and awareness of bitcoin. Of all those who learn from this experience. That’s another person adopted to use it.
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:45:45
Never said it was easy, only just only placing it into perspective of ₿. ��
@_date: 2019-11-10 04:32:46
Thank you! I'll do a month-long study and then report back on this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-10-14 00:22:11
Lol at least you caught the second mistake haha
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:53:49
I gave a tip in cash +  the $10 in btc. It's only shows the movement towards adoption.
From my point of view, crypto is a perfect way to tip someone. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:45:09
True, but the idea to introduce crypto into their lives in a thoughtful cherishing way is still good nonetheless
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:05:50
That’s a good idea. So that way it’s like one of those gift cards where they are valid for an (x) period of time, or expires on this date. So that way it seems fair and the money isn’t lost forever.
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:07:08
That's a good supporter right there!
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:31:39
I forgot in America you guys view tips as mandatory and not as an extra gift of gratitude.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:10:27
I guess it clearly says, "What do you predict the price will be?" and 2019 isn't over yet my dude haha
@_date: 2019-03-18 17:13:47
I want one
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:22:36
Which I did do this in addition to cash, that’s the statement that I’m trying to push across. 
I only did it because the people had a general understanding of what crypto was.
You also have to keep in mind the value of bitcoin fluctuates. If it increases to $20k that value would be worth $100. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:43:14
That’s why I wrote instructions in case they get lost. I know bitcoin is still a new phenomenon and people are sensitive for not selling in December. But it was the best way I thought it could help the average joe. There’s a learning for everything. 
Besides I’d only give it to someone who was into ₿ 
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:50:21
bitcoin ten commandments
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:48:02
Yeah, I’ll send you one as well
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:41:43
You can do that same exact thing with bitcoin. Even better lol��. Bitcoin is almost everything that cash is and better!!
So if most people already have a crypto wallet or know how to use it then the argument to use cash isn’t even recognized, because bitcoin is so much more efficient.
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:47:33
That’s why you have to state if they aren’t moved in 90 days, then you can take them back. Because you babysit the private keys. So that’s not an issue.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:35:11
Precisely. In the grand scheme of things, this is a gift that would be much more useful (more valuable in the future). Even if they were new to it, the value of knowledge about this opportunity is a gift none-the-less. 
Because it will absolutely shape our economy.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:55:24
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:17:41

@_date: 2018-10-30 00:11:57
You remember in late 2017-early 2018 on how there was big burst in crypto technology?
@_date: 2018-10-28 16:58:28
That’s what’s up!!
@_date: 2018-10-30 02:03:16
I know, I’m saying that the halving in 2016 influenced the spike. That’s why I said it had a minor part in it
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:13:44
That’s exactly what I’m referring to.
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:57:08
Well, you could actually pay your taxes with bitcoin, I just did like a few days ago.
Mortgage/Rent depends on your landlord. Most likely you could if you ask them.
@_date: 2019-03-10 05:23:17
It’s not something that focuses on the price, but more of how the perspective of BTC would be for everyday wonders. If anything, it’s an increase on bitcoin focus. Bitcoin and price correlation to Y Currency only helps sell the benefactor of how btc could be used or view towards the average person. It’s only for perspective purposes lol.
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:29:17
Then why are you in a bitcoin subreddit��??
Obviously with this insight you should belong on r/buttcoin
@_date: 2019-11-07 02:22:23
Is it not?
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:13:39
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:03:47
I understand and the good thing about it, you don’t have to know about all the vocabulary or technical knowledge with how it all works.
At the basic level:
Get a wallet (Coinbase is best for beginners)
Buy bitcoin from them or wherever.
The load is on your wallet (This act as your bank account)
Whenever you want to send money or pay for something, scan their QR code or copy and paste the address.
Then send. Now you are using bitcoin. Simple
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:05:55
The instructions would be inside the paper when you receive it.
If you had an account (if not you could make one, literally easy) with an exchange platform or wallet like Exodus, Coinbase, or Blockchain.com; there’s an option to “import” wallet. 
Use the private key to import wallet so you have access to the funds.
Then you could send it to another more secured wallet, and use it for purchases or sending bitcoin to an individual or organization for goods and services. 
No Bank. No ACH. No Bullshit. 
Just good old peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:37:36
Nah brah, I only send BTC. Send me your address and I’ll send 4 Bitcoins
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:31:04
You will be surprised how so many people don’t know that
@_date: 2019-03-23 12:54:39
It’s not shoveling anything down there neck. I’m introducing them to bitcoin. Anyway, the found it to be very unique and interesting. Someone there had remote knowledge of bitcoin so I asked before giving it to them.
If they didn’t know what it was, but open to learn about it, I would have gave them some guidance on utilizing it.
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:55:17
Nah I'm going to sell them
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:25:48
That makes it more meaningful 
@_date: 2019-03-25 15:47:14
In this case the person did Hold an interest
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:16:35
A little bit of this was due to the miners (this is a process on how bitcoin is ejected into circulation) rewards were halved from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC, causing scarcity in resource and massive appreciation in price. 
This is built into bitcoin’s code to occur on average every four years since 2009. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:03:25
This would never happen with bitcoin...

You are absolutely right. I for one think that the price of bitcoin will remain volatile even longer as the amount flowing into the market slowly reduce exponentially. There are solutions out there; it's the matter of getting the public to understand. However, you have facebook who kind of took a competitive advantage with their name and resource, to get ahead in the crypto space to be the self claim innovative adoption method for the world. It's just little that most know, it's a trojan horse
@_date: 2019-08-04 17:55:15
That's subjective. Never the less, bitcoin reign supreme. This photo alone from an artistic and literary standpoint, does show, how bitcoin is more reliable, convenient than cash. Don't look to deep into it. Take it at face value and disappear.

I see your concerns. It might be best to wait it out to see how layer 2 could handle it. Never the less, it's never a bad idea for sharing the thought of bitcoin. I don't think we have what we had in 2017 again because most people were only focused on the money-making aspect. The public is generally a little wiser, so we might take it more seriously towards the utilization factor. Might bring on more ideas than what we haven't thought possible yet.

What about the smaller miners, how do they often liquidate their coins? I know some people may have a small mining rig set up in a location of there's. 
If you mine, how do you usually liquidate your funds? If you don't want to share in public you can send me messages in private. 
Also, what does them being non-English speakers have to do with anything?? I feel like that part does not matter.

Thinking back at it you have point. Although we mainly would be thinking of it from the perspective of advanced crypto users, and this significantly does misleads and obscure messages that, in the grand scheme of things they do hit on the general points of cryptocurrency as a whole.

Where was this?
@_date: 2019-12-27 15:04:47
I’d argue against most of these. If there was a Bitcoin emoji, nearly everyone in the crypto community would use it. The existing ₿ symbol isn’t on iOS or it’s not easily accessible which is why people don’t use that one. When you have barrier of entries that reduces people’s motivation. It’s not an abstract symbol and can clearly be represented with a miniature version of the bitcoin logo. So what it has a petition behind it.?? That should only further enlighten that people would want it more. And finally there are several reasons why an emoji would be better, it’s a psychological aspect. Having the unicode in emoji form further achieves one accessiblity since everyone has emoji, and two it’s stands out. So there is a clear reason.
All in all, if they do confrim it it’ll definitely be something cool and interesting
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:25:45

True, now you have a point. Right now the crypto community is small and the technology is growing and expanding to a larger audience. This opens opportunity for more people to invest in bitcoin and perhaps use bitcoin or other crypto currency as standard form of payment. Me personally, I’d say around 2% of my transactions are via crypto (I run an online store). Even still that comes from me specifically targeting crypto enthusiasts. 
I also agree that, Bitcoin and the concept to understand around it can be a slight complex process to average joe.

He has multiple of points and that’s a reason why there hasn’t been massive adoption over the past ten years Bitcoin existed. There’s a series of stages that technology goes through before it becomes a wonder object we use in our daily lives and question what was life like without it.

Percisely, this is why I feel like platforms like Square/Cash app, Coinbase and Robinhood would help the average joe in understanding how cryptocurrency operates
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:35:00
I think bitcoin's complexity will never be "dumbed" down enough in essence for average joe to grasp the full understanding of it. Remember bitcoin is a compeleted project right from it's origination. However, I feel that companies like Square/Cash app, Coinbase, Binance (Although leans more towards the high level), and Robinhood are fantastic contenders in making bitcoin readily available in give trustful access to the currency. 
If anything, Coinbase would rise above them all as the "go-to-place" for crypto. When society acceptance around it increases, then opportunities for projects to thrive

That intent wasn't aimed at any definitive. Only in the instance of what cryptocurrency was built for off "Intended" purposes. Without people acknowledging the usage of it, it would essentially kill it's potential by limiting knowledge to speak freely, which you open the path to do just that.
In our statements we don't seek to pressure people to purchase bitcoin and use a certain way, people are free to use cryptocurrency as anyway they wish(this actually help with the experimentation of cryptocurrency), however stating the potential of what could become of such technology does deserve room for discussion as in statements that you misclassified as *"shoulds"* could deem many a reward of realization, and knowledge is power.

You missed my intention, I proposed these companies as essentially gateways for people to be further invited into crypto economy.  The average person is already skeptical or unaware how to use or even get bitcoin. It's worth noting people want simplicity, it's in human nature that people crave simplicity, especially for things they don't entirely understand. That's why so many projects are being built, to be able to position themselves in the right moment to provide crypto-centric services to the masses

Halving is the process when the reward for validating blocks(groups of transactions) to the blockchain is reduced by half. This makes bitcoin more scarce and the supply limited in distribution, in turn would drive the price due to high demand and low supply.

This is the thing I tell everyone. They always say, "It's hard turning it back to fiat", I rebuttle that statement with, bitcoin (or cryptocurrency as a whole) isn't something that should be transformed back to your native currency, yet something that should use in addition or in replace of cash. The more people realizes this, the more open people will be to cryptocurrency thus further the development.
