No transfers into RH until they better their anti money laundering policies. Can only buy sell and withdraw

I don't mind the content I see on the generic r/cryptocurrency subreddit... Have you tried that one? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:24:11
He's definitely a huge problem too! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:05:46
No worries. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:12:21
Isn't that a law of Bitcoin? The difficulty adjusts so that a block is mined every 10 minutes regardless of the amount of effort going into mining. Am I misunderstanding? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:01:46
If lightning works as intended great. But that is not a valid solution until it is actually up and running. You don't think multi-dollar average fees are a shitshow for something that people want to use as a currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:05:03
I think part of the problem begins with who is considered a "bcash troll." If you think all Bitcoin cash supporters fall into that group then you are part of the problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:03:33
Okay I see the difference in what your saying. Isn't there a difference between organized mining like pools and a situation where you have a lot of competing miners? It seems like competitive mining is where the energy waste could come in.

Provide some links please. All I can see is that the SEC suspended trading of a small cap crypto investment firm. I see nothing about futures trading. 
Furthermore, BCH APIs for price were listed on the Coinbase website two days ago. The writing was PUBLICLY on the wall.

Bitcoin Cash may be led by some shady people, but if Bitcoin Core was using the same tech right now we would be in a far better place. Lightning is coming? Great. It's not here yet, so make things actually fucking work until it does and stop being snobby ass hats about the coins that actually work at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:07:58
Well said. If this correction was caused by that news then it was probably mostly poorly informed people selling off. The news shouldn't really come as a surprise. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:49:32
Does anyone expect that they don't owe taxes on all of their trades? You do know that "like-kind" almost certainly won't apply to crypto right? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:02
This existed before the price hike. Some of you need to calm the fuck down, diversify your holdings, and realize that you're investing in a volatile market.

Hard to tell when most of the people on this subreddit aren't. Half the time it's a bunch of people shit talking Roger Ver while being just as huge of an ass as Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:07:15
Ha sorry. So many people going nuts this morning that I think I forgot what a joke was
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:02:34
I like this nickname so much more! He is awakened! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:06:30
Don't get me wrong! I hope that lightning lives up to the hype, but to date, the full utility of lightning is unproven and people are getting disuaded from Bitcoin core because there is no active solution to the problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:51:34
I've been on both pages for a few months and that's not true. Both pages talk about him a lot, obviously in different views. Both subreddits are out of control. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:55:13
No trademark on open source projects, buddy. Call it whatever you want but if you're gonna be a dick to others don't expect them to be convinced of your position. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:06
I own Bitcoin and understand the gripes against r/btc, but I also don't understood how the current status of the Bitcoin network or the idea of off-chain scaling fit with the utility of a decentralized immutable ledger. It's like everyone is just ignoring the total shitshow that is unfolding right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:10:15
Okay, but for a thought experiment let's disregard lightning for a second. Doesn't that extra competition mean more energy used per block? One person attempting to mine a block gets just as many transactions done as 1 million. I haven't seen many posts about how the energy usage has changed over time. Yes efficiency will increase, but the number of miners and the energy they put in will likely vary by price (increasing) and reward (decreasing). I don't see how all of that can possibly balance out to keep energy usage constant? Then the we can discuss the affect of lightning. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:03:01
Okay. So my initial thought was that as price and the inherent value of the reward increases the wastefulness would increase as well. I wasn't thinking about the fact that it is actually beneficial to the miners to not be competing against each other. Thanks for clearing up some of these issues. I definitely thought it would be a way bigger issue down the road. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:08:44
This all sounds great in theory, but still does not give a clear view to me about what that means for future mining competition. I love most of Andreas's work, but this seemed like a bit of a cop out answer to me. I do hope he (and you) is right. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:58:11
Yes, because Bitcoin's use case is increasing the price. Not cheap fast transactions. /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:23:30
Bitcoin Cash API was clearly listed on the Coinbase site before the spike. My guess is that the clever people saw what was happening and bought in. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:29:15
Someone explain to me why power usage will not increase. I understand that the block rate stays the same and rewards decrease, but as fees keep increasing and the price keeps skyrocketing that argument will prove invalid vary fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:46:39
Me too. But honestly I also thought I would get a lot more negative responses too. I'm kind of amazed that after searching the internet and posting on here I have still found very few (maybe zero?) arguements against the tangle that hold water. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:27:19
I definitely don't understand lightning as well as (I think) Iunderstand the tangle. But yes if that is even a possibility it seems like a hybrid of blockchain and the tangle could be insanely powerful. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:28:53
Mine was around 240 sat/byte. It was sent as a shapeshift trade through Coinomi so I will probably just wait to see if it gets rejected 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:17:22
Definitely true. And on that note it just got announced that another exchange will be listing it tomorrow. I'll probably try to go buy some on Binance tonight. Looks like IOTA just had a slight bump, which may be others doing the same thing. 
Incidentally, how was the wallet set up? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:52:06
Agreed. Looks like mine finally went through last night. Of course since it took so long it seems that there is now a delay on shapeshifts end and my money is still sitting in limbo. What a pain. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:47:55
Do you have a link to Buterin speaking against it? I found a couple comments from a quick Google search, but it seemed like he hadn't actually given it his full attention. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:25:05
Me too now. Just waiting for it to be a little more accessible 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:54:54
Am I the only one who has been waiting two days on a transaction confirmation? This is nuts! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:05:53
For the record... The total wait time was 2.75 days!
