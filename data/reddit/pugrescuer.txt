I was going to comment that "amazon-owned" in the title adds no value to the post.  Amazon own's twitch, that doesn't mean whatever twitch does amazon will follow suit.  It just means Amazon financially owns twitch.  They operate as individual companies.

@_date: 2014-08-28 02:55:59
I doubt they are holding any bitcoin.  It is too volatile from a business perspective to consider worth while to hold.  Especially when you factor in that they are not offering refunds in bitcoin, merely store credit.  Store credit and no btc refund says to me they are using it is a payment vehicle and nothing more.

fractional reserves in a elementary nutshell:  You goto bank and deposit $100.  I walk into bank and ask to borrow money.  The bank takes a fraction of their (your) reserve and loans it to me.  They make money off your money and they play the odds that in a given day not every customer walks into the bank to withdrawal all their funds.

It is less safe but simply because the bitcoin hashing total is much larger than liitecoin.  75,000 GH/s compared to ~16,000 GH/s respectively.  
However, the attach is the same.  The reward for a 51% attack on litecoin would be much less valuable compared to the same attack against bitcoin.  It is just proportional.

Litecoin mining is perfectly efficient with a botnet.  You don't pay electricity and each CPU can give a semi-ok hash rate.  
@_date: 2013-06-15 13:26:21
I think this is the most feasible.  Lots of good ideas here but many are very complex and have a lot of kinks to iron out.  This uses current infrastructure and ties it to your bitcoins which allows you to use bitcoins for this transaction.  Problem solved.  
@_date: 2013-09-05 13:01:29
That doesn't justify your original statement in anyway.  
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:12:31
You are missing the point entirely.  A botnet is free CPU cycles and free electricity.  Litecoin mining with a botnet can yield quite a lot actually.  
Sure, running your home desktop with cpu mining isn't worth it but a botnet is entirely different.  
Also - running a CPU based mining operation in a datacenter with lots of servers can also yield a lot of litecoins.

I think there needs some way for shippers to have a reputation associated with them.  Over time the more confirmed transfers of packages the better reputation they have.  
If a package goes from node A -&gt; node B (node B is not final dest) and no other nodes ever confirm the package we can assume node B is the thief.  At this point they are removed from the shipping topology.

    "wallet1" : 0.74584297,
    "wallet2" : 0.00011920,
    "wallet3" : 0.00000000
Your explanation was spot on and now I understand the idea of multiple wallets.  I have been able to move funds from one wallet to another: 


However, the unnamed wallet has a -0.60 and I am not sure how to reconcile this?

I am trying to understand this transaction from bitcoind.  I tried to send 0.5btc to one of the exchanges using: 


I do not understand why the total is 0.64490001.  I assumed it would cost more than 0.5 due to fees but 0.14490001btc does not make sense.  
What am I missing about this transaction?  
Appreciate the help and sorry if this is a dumb question. 
Also, I do see reading the man page that there is a sendtoaddress and a sendfrom which have slightly different ways of sending.  It seems it took some btc from 1 of my wallets and some from another.
