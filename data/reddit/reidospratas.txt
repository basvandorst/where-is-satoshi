It is not. But it will starting 2019.
This year, 2018, is the year we'll see central banks buy bitcoin. Now that stock exchanges are trading it, it's their time to make their first move. With unlimited wealth available, they can manipulate the Bitcoin market. We'll see a huge price increase this year.

Yes, like BCash lol. I've read news they are trying to create their own currency, however, no one would use that crap.

LOL this was the BEST.

Notice how the transaction cost went from 6 to 54 just a few days before this "correction". This is yet another organized attack from the BCH scammers.

I'm a new guy. Started investing in bitcoin last week, although I have been studying bitcoin and libertarianism for 2 years now.
HODLing. Bought at 15k, sold at 19k (was already expecting this), and with this drop I bought again at 14k.
They will remember when they sold their bitcoin for 15k only after LN is here.

I cashed out at 19k, cashed in at 15k.
Profit. These attacks will only make me richer.

Thank you for the cheap coins :).

This dude should be removed from humanity. Piece of shit.

Yes, centralized is the future. Kappa.
Go keep your scammy piece of coin, enjoy losing everything in the next few years.+

In fact, with the colossal economical apocalypse to come, we might see bitcoin go to the milions and actually replacing the dollar as storage value. But if this will happen within this cycle is impossible to say.

60k? You're doing it wrong.
Even wronger if you consider the fact you are planning to sell BTC and not keep it as reserve of value.

Celebrate and hodl

Are you a trillionaire yet, mr. prophet?

Impossible to predict. Either the bankers will willingly capitulate to Bitcoin, already having accumulated themselves, or over the next decade and the big economical crisis will defeat them.
I believe we will see their capitulation to Bitcoin in the next decade. I believe they are already accumulating. We might slowly see the media shift towards a more pro-bitcoin approach, and slowly making the public mind. I think this is the only way bankers could save their wealth from the catastrophe to come.

I have very similar expectations. Since the last crash I believe it will go up to something between 150 and 400k, crashing down to 30-90k
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:55:13
My expectations are something between 150 and 400k, but that's by 2021 or 2022.
