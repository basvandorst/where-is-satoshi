Gox was basically the biggest exchange, and a lot of older investors still have(or had) their money there. A lot of people are wary of the centralized exchanges, and looking for more secure ways of converting fiat, which may or may not be viable.

There is a built-in escrow system, which heavily mitigates risk.

I think I understand most of what you're saying, but what a do you mean by "time" rate of supply/demand? I've never heard that term with "time" added to it.

I would imagine most would be on the darknet. It's probably hard to find a reliable vendor on the clearnet who wouldn't get shut down.

Tor is sluggish, but has gotten faster recently. If the team can create some kind of incentive for hosting nodes, it will get much better in the future.

I don't mean before this happened, I mean that it was once the biggest exchange, and many older bitcoiners kept their money there, even after it was no longer the biggest exchange. The masses of newer users had coinbase and others, but the older ones still had mtgox accounts. With the money gone, they're angry (and justifiably so).
They probably should have switched to something safer (paper wallets, etc.) a long time ago, but hindsight is always 20/20.

Additionally, you can have anonymous escrow transactions, making it far easier to trade with people you originally wouldn't be able to trust.
There's an article called lex cryptographia that goes into detail about this.
edit: many people use different definitions of smart contact, but I think escrow counts.

Transactions to stealth addresses are untraceable.What I mean by "two sides of the coin" is that dark wallets have both user-friendliness and are useful to the black market, which hasn't really been seen before.

Slavery implies you are being forced to comply with the wishes of others. In a direct democracy, it would be the wishes of other citizens. In most governments, it means that you are being forced to comply with the wishes of large corporations with lobbying power.
I believe you would agree that those lobbyists and corporations don't deserve power over us, and I don't think that being forced to leave because of this corruption is the way to deal with the problem at hand.
The government may have been run by the people once, which could possibly be justifiable. But it certainly isn't justifiable now.

Don't worry about it.
Put simply, inflation of a currency occurs when there is more of it (assuming the markets stay the same). When the number of bitcoins reaches 21 million, we'll have no inflation. No more Bitcoins can be made.
edit: Deflation occurs when there is less of a good relative to the market. So when the market grows and there are still only 21 million bitcoins, we will have deflation.

Why would it be short term? Darkwallet and CoinJoin implementation would be able to provide privacy from here on out, right? (I'm assuming there aren't any bugs, or extremely advanced decryption methods)


Preserving reputation doesn't mean we need everyone's identities public and know how much XBT they have. The point of Bitcoin was likely to never know everyone else's information in the first place, but it seems that Satoshi had to make a compromise and use pseudonymous accounts.
Most of the big criminals can already make their bitcoins "disappear," although this app will be a particularly user-friendly way to do it.
The other possibility is blacklists of the bitcoin network, which would essentially make the network just like the current banking system we're trying to get away from.
I agree that this may tarnish Bitcoin's reputation in the media, but the internet had similar problems when it was getting started. The way to surpass this isn't by preventing drug dealers online (which is almost completely impossible at this point), but creating bitcoin spaces and applications that are easy and accessible for newcomers to use. So far, it seems like Dark Wallet is both sides of the coin, so to speak.

Auctions of luxury goods as well as car sales in bitcoin occur now and again, but I don't know if if properties are sold as often.
If you sell and advertise on the sub, it will at least get some attention.

Yes, but that was its job. To help dissidents in places like China. Everyone knew that the protocol was government created. I think it's unlikely that the government would create Dark Wallet.

How does Obelisk work? Does every OpenBazaar user need to host a node? What's the difference between obelisk and DHT?

The idea is for incentives to be structured so as to mitigate the probability of only having one mafia in any given area to protect you. Even if most people moved to startup cities/integrated townships/ZEDEs, you would be able to choose between different cities to live in, with slightly different laws/enforcement. The most successful will be the ones with the best law and enforcement systems.

They didn't back off, miners left.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:11:56
Yeah, you're right. Both inflation and deflation are relative to the growth in the market.

The hashed data for the colored coin used to be in the coin itself, it was called OP_RETURN. However, the space for information in the 600 satoshis (or more) has decreased from 80 bytes to 40.
This means that one cannot store the full hash on the blockchain itself. Instead, the 40 bytes of space are linked to a website address,  (the website you use can be customiszable) which lists the hash. Although the data is linked in the blockchain, you still need to rely on the website that stores the hash.

If they were government agents, they wouldn't help create open source tech that were so disruptive. They would try to slow down the teams that were doing so, and make them look terrible, but the unSystem people are doing this anyways for publicity.

Yep. It offers relatively trustless architecture AND real time trading. Day traders should love it.

Many of the servers may start out being controlled by a single entity, but other entities (and servers) will inevitably join because they want in on the profits from fees. This will allow servers to operate anonymously and still not run off with funds.
edit: A higher multisig ratio (9500 of 10000) would also help. as one entity would have to control the vast majority of servers. The pool should remain secure with as few as 500 other servers.

What's up

Well, the value of the dollar isn't stable due to inflation, but it's still more stable than bitcoin. Perhaps in the future when speculation decreases, bitcoin will become as stable (or even more stable than the dollar).
It's probably going to be a few years or more before that happens, and bitcoin will have to expand at high rates, but stability is definitely possible.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:46:27
It could restrict (somewhat) the ability to turn government money into Bitcoin, but it couldn't stop Bitcoin itself. I don't think it's a big issue in many places. Germany and China have already stated their policy (or lack thereof) for dealing with Bitcoin.

I agree that it has already been debunked, at least here. I might just be preaching to the choir at this point, but there are still a few people on this sub that don't seem to understand the concept, even if they would agree with it.
I think people would still invest in your business, they'd just give you slightly less money than needed for the business(depending on the rate of deflation). By the time you had to actually spend it, the money would be valued enough for buying whatever necessary to run the business. It seems like a similar problem to the issue of people not buying goods and services with Bitcoin.
Even if the ideas in the last paragraph wouldn't work out, people invest in businesses to gain a fairly serious return on investment. Unless Bitcoins deflated at a very fast rate, people would still make more by investing.

I don't think lack of a TLDR  necessarily makes it worse. Plenty of ideas are complicated enough that they need to be examined whole, and aren't easily summarized.
