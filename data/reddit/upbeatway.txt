True. 
But those illegals ain't getting past any walls - not in any mass numbers at least.
Maybe they should consider what I did and use the legal route to immigrate here.
If you are pro-illegal then you are certainly against those who followed the law and migrated here legally and peacefully.

You are conflating welfare with socialism. Thats not what the nordics think - he literally called it a market economy.

From a ZH commenter:
No need for MMT, socialism will settle everything across the board. Revoke all passports, close all border crossings, then start shearing the sheep. The rich can only flee if you allow them. Think the Saudi prince who allowed the wealthy to depart after confirmation of financial transfers to his satisfaction. Wonder if AOC will look stupider wearing her crown or about the same?
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:12:46
The rich will just move. And if they don't move, they will move their wealth. At worst, productive people will stop being productive - since you have taken away their incentive.
Better a money supply that does not lose value and low taxes for everyone.
Don't burden the rich because you are poor/unproductive.

The current crop liberals are badly misinformed it seems. Probably because of blind belief in the msm (throw in fox for all I care).

The Scandinavians are not socialistic. This is a great misnomer. The Danish PM recently gave a speech where he talks about how he is baffled that Americans think the Scandinavians are socialistic - when they are in fact market capitalistic. 
They just tax themselves like crazy - as a result cost is living is though the roof, rich people run away to Monaco or other tax havens and no one is having babies.

I said they spend it on shit products (like an iphone that slows down after 2 years) - rather than on quality goods.
In a deflationary currency they would only spend on quality goods, since they are giving up their deflationary currency now vs later (when the prices would be even lower).

People spent gold and other deflationary currency throughout history and markets moved with no issues.
I disagree that you need inflationary currency to move a market. People spend because they want to, not just because they are forced to because of a shit currency.
You are making an argument for the pointlessness of saving an inflationary currency. Indeed, that is why people spend so freely on goods that are of low quality in these times.
