Yes. It takes just as much time to pull out my bitcoin wallet on my phone as it does to pull a card out of my wallet, with the added benefit of costing the business less in transaction fees.

You have a point, but I always feel like a schmuck swiping a card for anything less than $5.

If that's how you feel about it, don't hang out in It's a method of exchange that ensures only the person holding the key can initiate the transaction. It doesn't need to be a currency, it can be a car title, deed, what have you. Is just easier to do it as a currency.

Markets do this all the time when people start to go crazy. Happened to Google in novemberish I believe (price dropped from 700 to 500 in half an hour). This will just cool everybody's heels so they will stop panicking and making rash trades. 
Happens the other way too. First solar skyrocketed the other day, and now it is back to normal. Due to forcing traders to calm down.

I would be interested in how this was done.

Inflection, not drop. Just means there will be a decrease in how much it is increasing. At which point you approach the high, and drops towards the "true" value. The author isn't necessarily wrong since I doubt they were considering an entire country's banking system collapsing and the people flocking to another currency.

What's wrong with "I could care less"?
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:56:23
No he didnt. He spend the equivalent of a pizza on pizza.

Exactly, you haven't actually lost anything until you sell. Until then, your money is Schroedinger's cat with a very large and flashing sign telling you where it is.

Yeah, the only thing I got from that article was "we acknowledge that this thing exists and are paying a little attention, but we could destroy it with our piles of cash if we wanted"

How about 10% on all income after cost of living is subtracted?
@_date: 2013-09-04 16:37:23
But, by the fact that you are arguing about something, it implies that you are putting effort and "care" some amount about the argument. By saying you could care less means you recognize how much "care" is being put into the argument and that it isn't worth the effort, yet you continue. 
I could care less about the usage of "I could care less", but this is the internet, so argument.

That is exactly the problem with bitcoin as a currency, there is no incentive to spend it. It is a great way to hold wealth, such as buying gold, but there's a reason no one uses gold as a currency, it'd be stupid to use it to buy anything that doesn't increase in value. This is where the troubles with bitcoin are, once miners rely on transaction fees, then there needs to be an increase in the number of transactions or cost of transaction. With people unwilling to spend their coins, there will be fewer transactions. The network could then collapse if mining is no longer profitable.
Overall it should be pretty self sustaining, with collapse come more transactions, which brings it back up again. But when the network hashrate decreases, a 51% attack becomes easier.

I am curious whether this is a scam or not, has anyone received any orders yet? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:09:54
For everyone I know, this IS the only thing. I've been trying to get set up just so I can buy bitcoins since before they reached $100. And I still haven't finished the process of verifying my accounts. So yes, anybody trying to get their first bitcoin is hampered by the difficulty of trying to get set up.

I'm hoping it will continue to drop until payday...
