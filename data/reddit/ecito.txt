I'm venezuelan and have thought of this a lot as well. I feel this would be a great way for venezuelans to have their own "dollars bank account", without having to go to the US to open one. It would shield them from all the scams out there, and it would allow people to buy and ship physical goods to venezuela using various btc-&gt;virtual card services and not succumb to ridiculous price markups.
Ideally there'd be a way to buy bitcoins with cadivi approved dollars, but I haven't been able to figure out how (nobody will sell btc via credit card due to chargebacks). However if this could be pulled off somehow I could see a boom in bitcoin usage in venezuela.
If black market dollars are the only choice, I believe bitcoin could still thrive, just not so quickly. In any case, there would have to be a very reliable and trustworthy way of getting bitcoins for bolivares but I haven't been able to come up with a good solution.
One problem is that according to the Ley de Ilícitos Cambiarios (Exchange Crimes Law), bitcoin seem to be covered under the definition of Divisas (currency). 
If you can think of anything let me know. Also, let me know if you know of any other communities on the internet where bitcoin venezuela is discussed. 
I'm a programmer and can definitely dedicate a good piece of my time building a service for this. I'm all for helping out my country get around this stupid shit.
