Ah, I see. Also, I forgot to ask if it’s illegal to do so in NYC? Because I remember seeing something on LBC about New York residents no longer being able to purchase bitcoins.

“From today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency unless you have applied for the license.”
And eh, I think I know what I’m doing lol it’s just the other things outside the actual trading that I’m worried about.

I know man, I'm sitting here debating back and forth to myself lol I think I might not and probably just regret it later on ):

What's that? I was going to use electron cash to split them 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:52:43
So do you think it will be okay for me to download the file on the same computer I have electrum on as long as I just remove the BTC from the first wallet onto a new one and then split?

I was just about to do the same thing lol sheesh, thank you for this post. And sorry to hear that :\ they're just having delays though, they're not a scam

I hear changelly is taking hours right now for transactions though :\ and kraken doesn't work in my area. Where else can I exchange?

Alright but is downloading the BCH file to split the coins on a different computer a must too? That's more of the question I'm asking 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:33
Lmaoooo are you guys being sarcastic or you actually think it's the smart thing to do right now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:48:16
Where do you store BCH? I've been using electrum for btc
