In my opinion, for day to day transactions, bitcoin will be surpassed by a block chain with faster blocks. This is because you don't want to wait in like at Starbucks every time you want to buy a coffee. While 7trXMK is right when he says 10 1 minute blocks and 1 10 minute have the same security, the 1 minute block is more useful when trying to get as many customers through as possible in a certain time frame.

You make some good points; The point I was trying to make is how the 10 minute block time is too much for most day to day transactions. Especially if your transaction doesn't get picked up in the next block to come out of the network, you would have to wait at least 20 minutes for the first confirmation. Orphans are a problem, but transactions that are in an orphaned chain are still valid transactions and will be added in subsequent blocks (if the TX fee is right). I would imagine there would be some sort of service like you mentioned implemented, however that could cause centralization
EDIT: You could even take 0 confirmations if you had some sort of Biometric data associated to the transaction (fingerprint, voiceprint, retina scan), so that if it was fraud that person would be permabanned from the store.

Scientific exploration is driven by creativity, pulling something apart and not breaking it is not something children are known for. Did I ever say he was a peer reviewing scientist? Or a genius? No. I think he is a creative kid in a broken school system. Why do you not like him so much? Is it that you were definitely that smart at that age and because you are not brown you don't get any breaks?

I still fail to see any bomb that outright has a large ass LCD display timer countdown like in the movies and TV. It literally would cause less damage and you would allow people time to get away. A cellphone triggered bomb is most likely.

How can you deny that this story is based on race? Did I do anything but recognize institutional racism? Is that you in the video? Just because talking about race makes you uncomfortable, it is irrelevant to the discussion? I am just outlining another lens to look at issue through. What did I say that was racist besides the sarcastic reference to 'normal'? Are you that dense?

If you think that this would have happened to a white Christian boy in Texas then you are mistaken.

Exploring the nature of the inside of things is not creative? lol
@_date: 2015-09-26 22:36:56
You are so angry, why? I never implied any of that lol. He took apart a clock and showed it to other kids who were like 'wuteva' and then the admins went whacko, I agree, then people were fed misinformation by the media who were also too stupid to realize what it was, something that they all had that was merely taken apart, and yet none of these people had any idea what they were looking at and called the police. Who detained the kid without his parents or a lawyer present, in a school, which is there to protect the kids, not let them be intimidated by police secretly(something that happens all the time), it is fairly clear to me that if he was 'normal'/s the reaction of the school would have been quite different. I agree with you for F- because he would have had to make a poster board describing something he did with it, something that was not required, as it was just something he was just tinkering with.

Is the offer still good?
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:14:30
Good idea! Maybe to avoid making yourself a large target for fraud you could actually just round up to the nearest whole dollar, in addition it could boost your sale of $0.10 items just so they could get $.95 worth instead of $0.05. I would start low then if demand requires you could increase that limit.

What if you sold them for bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-03-28 09:15:56
You have to transfer your coins out of your mining address and into a trading site like mtgox or btce where you can convert at market price to USD. From there you have to go to another exchange site for trading btcUSD for a bank wire or a bunch of other options

I think that it will apply in many ways, but the most apparent would be adoption rates. If you look at any developing technology (cell phones, personal computers, TV's, Sewing Machines) the adoption as a function of time when plotted against a logarithmic plot tends to be linear. A way to think about it is that it is way easier to go from 90,000 to 100,000 adopters than it is to go from 10,000 to 20,000. A relevant passage states (its a long one :/): "Virtually all of the economic models taught in economics classes and used by the Federal Reserve Board to set monetary policy, by government agencies to set economic policy, and by economic forecasters of all kinds are fundamentally flawed in their view of long-term trends. That's because they are based on the "intuitive linear" view of history (the assumption that the pace of change will continue at its current rate) rather than the historically based exponential view. The reason that these linear models appear to work for a while is the same reason most people adopt the linear view in the first place:  exponential trends appear to be linear when viewed and experienced for a brief period of time, particularly in the early stages of an exponential trend, when not much is happening. But once the "Knee of the curve" is achieved and the exponential growth explodes, the linear models break down."

What he is implying is that you can receive funds to a bitcoin wallet just by posting the address to your website! You do not need kickstarter if you already have the ability to use reddit

Hello, The one thing nobody here seems to realize is how disruptive bitcoins could be if they ever gained enough traction with mainstream retail outlets. If enough people around the world realized that bitcoins were not going to fail and that they were a superior payment system and store of value then there could be a "run" on the banks. This would occur if more than ~15% of depositors tried to withdraw all of their funds in a short time frame. Once the bank ran out of available cash the FDIC would step in and replace their funds, however during this time the dollar would drastically decrease in value due to a decrease in demand, and peoples savings could be obliterated in purchasing power through no fault of their own. Anyways probably not what you were looking for but here is my BTC address: 1NURgM6jkLHxyL7BSh16BtYCzG2pd9KPhu
