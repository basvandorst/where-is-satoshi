Well is constantly praising and talking about the BTC price increases, you don't see ever discussing any non-theymos approved forks or BIPs. allows discussions of all bitcoin chains, doesn't allow discussion of anything other than what Theymos is allowing you to discuss. So I'd say if anything is a cult, its this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:08:42
Theymos is the person that controls literally every bitcoin discussion forum, and bans anyone that doesn't agree with his views. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:57:08
I've never personally seen that, but I have seen people calling out bitfinex for their BTC pump and dump USDT token.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:41:25
Thats mostly because they've created a echo chamber where newbies come in and think "oh okay this is how bitcoin works" without reading into it, and then continuing their harrasment campaign against alternative viewpoints. 
There are a few people discussing bitcoin core here, but if you try to discuss dissenting opinions you'll either get automatically flagged by their word-filter, get banned or get your post deleted for "promotion of altcoins", whereas BIPs that fit theymos' ideology are allowed to be discussed freely as long as its in a positive light. So in other words, not a crazy claim. Read into theymos' history a little

Actually Segcoin is not BTC per definition. BCC is the closest you get to the real Bitcoin as outlined in the white paper.

Yeah that'll never happen its sad that this sub is filled with so many people with zero idea of how markets and pricing works that try to say things as if they know what they're talking about.

Not just 2x, segwit in general is much less efficient than continuing with block-size increases like we have been since the dawn of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:54:23
They're scared segwit won't function properly with 2MB blocks kind of like what's happening with litecoin where they don't even use segwit to any large degree.

ETC fell along with ETH when all the altcoins dumped, but ETC can be used as an example for what could happen to BCC where it will start out low ($400 in our case) and fall down a little for a couple months then eventually once the segcoin shills have no more free BCC to dump it will start to increase in price until it closely matches that of Segcoin. BCC has the support of most of the major financial players and as such is much more likely to succeed than ETC, yet still went as far as it did.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:35:22
Daily reminder that ETC was referred to as a free shitcoin that people would dump, but ended up going from $2 to $25 in less than a year

They do come out all the time, but the mods on this sub actively remove up to hundreds of posts per day that aren't praising segwit/bcore. You just have to be there before the mod team nukes them
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:42:18
lmao are you implying segwit is actually more secure than if we did a BCC-esque blocksize increase? How mentally ill are you?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:11:02
Its up like $400 from last week, but long term anyone who's ever read a economics book would realize that BCC will only keep increasing in price. This price increase came a little earlier than I'm comfortable with, but I assume it had to do with BCC being more profitable to mine than Bcore by over 150% at one point.
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:48:53
Segcoin is another way to say bitcoin core now that they're moving so far away from the original white paper it can no longer be called bitcoin with a straight face.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:01:36
Its for scaling. If BCH had 1MB blocks still the memepool would look like bitcoins memepool, whereas BCH now able to wipe the memepool even when its attacked in a matter of hours/minutes with full blocks. The first 8MB BCH block was mined a couple weeks ago during such an attack. In the even that BCH throughput reaches a point where 8MB blocks are the norm it would look alot like bcore currently does and it would be time to scale to a higher blocksize again

It doesn't though. It created a Bitcoin (Core) wallet, then it also creates a Bitcoin Cash wallet on the side, with the Core wallet being used for literally everything by default.

This is a prime example of why you should stop listening to FUD without verifying it first.

You do realize the bot is literally named right? It looks for keywords and replied with one of the 5 pre-made phrazes. How stupid are you
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:22:50
So what about Ethereum Classic then? Does not create any confusion? Its a pure Core/Bitfinex marketing scam to discredit BCH
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:05:26
Neither did OP claim so. Why are you Bitcoin fanboys so quick to defend your coin?
@_date: 2017-05-04 23:03:12
I know multiple people that have moved away from bitcoin entirely for day-to-day online purchases entirely due to the cancer wait times, and most casinos have had to open up to multiple altcoins to combat this. Anything less than $50 with a standard fee in, my experience, takes half a day to be confirmed, and in some cases even multiple days. And that was at 1200. (Thanks Core)

His point is that segwit and related propaganda organizations want to not only fuck Satoshi's vision but remove miner incentive at the same time. Cheap TX's are not a good thing for anyone other than extremely poor people, and poor people shouldn't be using BTC in the first place.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:51:21
Could say the same thing about this sub. 90% of the posts are pro-segwit propaganda, and the mods ban anyone who posts satoshis original scaling ideas or tries to start a conversation about why segwit might not be as good for the network. r btc doesn't ban people for voicing their opinions, so you're free to tell people there why you think segwit is good despite its obvious flaws.

Adsense is a joke.. They have such extremely strict rules on which websites can host their ads, yet 99% of their ads are tech support scams and phishing sites.

Actually he said that if you've been in bitcoin since 2008 and you can't afford 20k to help the network piss off. So if bitcoin has made you rich, don't buy a underpowered shit raspberry pi.
