Sorry for my ignorance, but could you clarify what you mean by "a true exchange"?  I thought Coinbase was a true exchange.  At least, according to a lot of what I've read and sites like this:

I'm about ready to throw in the towel and sell all my BTC to minimize my tax liability for the year by offsetting gains in more legitimate markets (like the stock market) with my staggering BTC losses.

I'm with you. I feel your frustration. I've lost a ton too. I used to love visiting Coindesk to see the price -- now I know that if I do, it'll just make my day worse, so I've stopped checking as frequently as I used to. It's slot-machine addictive...ahhh, a 1% increase!  Yes!  The next day...a 4% decrease...crap.  The day after that, up 0.5%, sweet!  Darn, down another 3% the day after.  I'm holding out for the long term too, but have resigned myself to the fact that I'll be okay if I never see this money again.

I do like the sound of my own voice, but I also like interesting conversation.

Right, I understand what you're saying, but the net result is the same -- the buyer of the equity, or in this case, Bitcoin, is paying a higher price than the current market price.
I'd agree on the volatility theory if the Buy price didn't keep reverting to the original Buy price AFTER my Buy, and down to the penny, but that's happened 3x in a row now.

Actually I didn't say "uh guys".  I'm purty good with the English language.

Yes, THANK GOD the price is tanking, so that Bitcoin may become more stable.  Clearly a blessing in disguise.  (sarcasm)

Step 5. Take a tax loss and put the money into an investment that has a chance of actually making you money.  The S&amp;P 500, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, oil, rubles, shillings, Zimbabwean dollars...

The biggest problem with the argument that Bitcoin is getting stronger because of "more merchants, more transactions, more....", is that despite all this, nobody wants to hold onto Bitcoin.  Yes, more merchants are accepting Bitcoin, but those same merchants don't want to hold onto Bitcoin for any longer than the few milliseconds it takes to convert it to fiat.  And for good reason.  They'd lose a lot of money.  The benefit of the convenience of Bitcoin is outweighed by the continuous price fall.  Merchants don't see Bitcoin as a currency -- they see it as a method of payment, like Visa or Mastercard.  If they saw it as a currency, then:
1. Their prices would remain constant, regardless of the ups and downs in Bitcoin price.  Meaning, if something costs 1 BTC today, it would cost 1 BTC tomorrow.  But that doesn't happen -- the prices a merchant charges in BTC are BASED on the equivalent dollar or other fiat currency value.
2. They wouldn't convert to fiat as quickly as possible after receiving Bitcoin.

This post makes zero sense.  You will sell your car and buy "it all" in BTC?  What all?

If only the reddit Bitcoin fanatics actually had the money to buy enough Bitcoin to increase the price...

Let's say I sold a bunch of Bitcoin in December 2017, but Coinbase didn't let me withdraw the cash as USD until Jan 2018, because of their really low withdrawal limits. Do I still have to pay capital gains taxes for 2017 or can I push it back to 2018 since the money wasn't accessible to me until 2018?
