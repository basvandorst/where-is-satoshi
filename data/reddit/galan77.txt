Let's just run the numbers, not use opinions here and look at the most likely outcome. 
Hash rate is 1:1 correlated with adoption and adoption is with price. Look at the charts. We can't just say "No, later on adoption would not correlate 1:1 with price anymore" or "No, later on adoption would correlate with price anymore. " The current evidence clearly points to a direct correlation between hash rate and price/adoption. 
With a market cap of $5T, 50x times bigger than now. which is where Bitcoin needs to be if it wants to replace FIAT, it would most likely consume 50 times more energy than now. 9,000M GJ and thus more than all banks, all governments, all paper companies, all gold mining together.
For Bitcoin to replace all FIAT at $50T, it would most likely consume 10x more than all banks, all governments, all paper companies, all gold mining together.

Though $400m will move the price $20B by itself since there is a 50x factor as found by JP Morgan. That’s an 10% increase in price for all crypto including a few altcoins that would get a lot of price increase, this is big news. 
Have 5 more universities join in we have a 100% increase in price and probably a few altcoins with 300%.

Why only OTC?? 150 BTC is only a small amount of not even $2M.
You can get the on Binance by accumulating for only an hour without even raising the price. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:08:37
Does it matter really?
They sold Tether for real $2.5B, that they received. So as long as they didn’t spend $500M on parties they still have that money.

But this is the case for any cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:02:18
They have solved the trilemma with Sharding, it’s a well known way to do it . Dash has done it with chainlocks.
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:48:20
So what happened to the last tweet?
@_date: 2019-10-14 10:22:34
How does Sharding lead to centralization?
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:18:11
Not if youre all in...
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:45:24
All in alts since January :D
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:37:10
These kind of otc trades happen every day. 
Those blockchains are qkc, zil, which have sharding fully up and running and become more decentralized and scalable with every node added. Dash also is immune to 51% attacks.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:55:17
It stayed 12h above 51% until enough miners (1%) switched to fall under 50% again  
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:51:08
You can also send the $100M to your own address and then distribute it to various cryptos, send them through tumblers, monero etc. There are enough ways to do it. You can also cash out on both chains since one portion of the miners want to stick to the original chain, some to the new one, see Eth DAO incident.
Do you also have a thorough argument to back up your claim? :D
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:59:43
False :) 
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:58:19
Green energy isn’t free.

As I said, it’s just one article. 
You would need to refute the technology, not the article.
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:27:11
And then all except hardcore bitcoin hodlers pull out of bitcoin. This includes institutional investors, the price drops by 80% or more and people look for blockchains that actuallu can’t be taken over by a government. 
Why is it not profitable if they double spend $100M.
@_date: 2019-10-14 09:16:32
There are thousands of articles about it. Here just one example 
Sharding is an architecture that has been widely used in networks and databases for a much longer time than Bitcoin has existed and that has virtually unlimited scalability, decentralization and security.
@_date: 2019-10-14 07:18:43
Miners don’t switch. They are very, very, very lazy. 
Even when a pool had more than 51% hash power a couple of years ago, they didn’t switch and the pool had to force miners out. 
When China takes over the pools, it would take more than a day until enough miners have switched, which is way enough time to perform a 51% attack.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:29:22
It’s bot crashing. You can call it crashing when it goes below $7,000, before then it’s daily fluctuations. Have fun.
@_date: 2019-06-10 19:06:49
Still not true, you need several users until the co2 footprint amortizes.
Then you need constant maintenance and replace almost everything after 15y of operation. 
Lots of factors at play there.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:23:22

Isn’t that almost the same as IOTA’s new cellular automaton?
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:04:39
I just looked up batching. If we batched all transactions in a block it would only reduce the block size by 9% no? 
What do you mean by batching is the standard, 80%+ aren’t using it. 
Regarding the lightning network, it would need to  handle half of all Bitcoin transaction in a few months to prevent the described scenario. Wouldn’t it need 100x more capacity than now for that?
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:51:25
Yes they can vary up and down on many factors, so assuming it’s neither, it will be clogged with a 50% rise? What about looking at it more conservatively? 
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:52:54
Are you referring to the root chain? Because the root chain secures the shards and is mined by many nodes as well. 
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:55:58
No it means that altcoins grow slower than bitcoins sometimes.  they still grow in usd, but not in btc.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:58:05
Which immediately affects the one another. If one market goes down, the other follows within seconds.
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:08:31
This is today, tomorrow alts rise compared to bitcoin again. This alternates every couple of days.
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:31:25
Yes but with all the things you mentioned, segwit, lightning, zksnarks, the Bitcoin network will be completely clogged if the transaction rate only goes up by 50%, which can happen with just a small price bump to $5,000, no? 
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:13:54
So what happens when the transactions increase by 5x when the next pumps comes say to $15,000 till the end of the year? Can the on-chain network sustain this transaction volume without fees shooting up into the sky again? 
What about a real bull run with a 100x increase or 200x? That’s a likely scenario and can definitely happen to on-chain transaction volume. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:46
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:46:17
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:54:54
However it didn’t resists it? It made the chain completely useless for most transactions. 
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:17:36
It has been like this for years, it is like this right now and there is nothing that indicates that this will change any time soon .
Is that your standard for security?
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:28:20
That’s false, because if you sell altcoins for btc they still fall compared to usd.
@_date: 2019-12-14 08:31:26
Do you actually understand those technologies and have actual arguments?
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:06:47
So why do you support a centralized system so strongly when there are better alternatives?
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:29:49
Qkc, zil with sharding a very long established scaling solution, ETH soon too. Ela with side chains. 
The problem is PoW, a very flawed algorithm, which comes with so many downsides and much better tech already exists. 
Of course, those smaller coins don’t have the adoption, but saying Bitcoin has great decentralization and PoW is great is simply untrue.
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:46:59
Why 4 and a half? 154 days is 5 months.
@_date: 2019-12-14 08:43:39
There is no argument against what the whole article is about.
The Chinese government can do a double spend if they want to, which would massively damage confidence in Bitcoin crypto for years.
This is EXACTLY what Bitcoin was supposed to be safe against. It has failed it’s main USP.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:17:19
So Bitcoin is not for poor people?
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:58:37
You say this


But then Bcash would also work with 10x of Bitcoin’s traffic and Ethereum has much smaller blocks than Bitcoin, no?
Also, how is ethereum centralizing nodes?

Which they will change as soon as possible and "integrated additional ways to withdraw funds soon". All fud here.
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:47:28
You are locked in the Bitcoin platform that is riddled with heavy mining pool centralization, strong cultish behaviour, scalability issues, energy waste and there is very little effort to change that. 
Not a good long term way to do it at all if you want to mitigate risk and build a large business.
@_date: 2019-04-09 13:22:44
How can you bank the unbanked when the blockchain is increasingly used by numerous companies and rich people?
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:40:18
Then you are locked in with one platform and there is no competition, which is always very bad. It’s like saying there should only be Apple or only Facebook.
Surprised to see this from a Bitcoiner, which should all about decentralization, free markets, no power in one entity. 
This leading to huge inflation is false, because having 1,000 new tokens doesn’t lead to 1,000 more money since only very few get real traction and get long term growth.
@_date: 2019-04-26 07:18:35
BAT  has fixed supply doesn't it?

@_date: 2019-04-26 09:52:46
If you build something on top of it, you’re still restricted by their mining pool centralization, scalability issues, which can cause large problems in all areas of bitcoin once the main chain is clogged again and numerous other issues.
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:41:53
Nowhere does it say that it’s on top of uphold. This is your own specific opinion that you completely made up. If you make such a specific claim, you need specific evidence. 
It could be like you say it would be, but nowhere does it indicate that.
@_date: 2019-04-26 10:12:06
Bitcoin community praising a network that is used by mostly racists (not exagerrated)  only because it competes with a token. 
Good grief.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:55:59
Sure, 4 mining pools after 10 years is great decentralization, cough. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 18:14:25
That doesn’t matter, because bitcoin mining has now become 1,000x more profitable. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:32:44
So the market won't go up much before all remaining 165 coins are sold, which would probably take a year? 
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:57:33
Yes, it’s 1,000x when bitcoin is used by a billion people, at which point its price will probably be in that range. At that point it will have 300x the energy usage of the world’s banking system while the banking system serves around 5 billion people.
So, Bitcoin would use around 1,500x more energy than the banking system per 1 billion people...
@_date: 2019-01-31 13:01:19
So it’ll only be worse?
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:06:58
Volume, number of addresses, price, popularity pick any of those. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:08:32
Both are wrong.
Refusing to take anything else than bigger blocks as a solution is dumb.
Refusing to increase blocksize completely is also dumb.
As with all things, the solution lies in the middle. There is no downside for 16MB blocks with the current hardware and having LN at the same time. Sure, 1GB is probably to big, but definitely not 16MB. 
However, crypto is ruled by mentally 12y old olds who can only see black and white. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:40:28
The price of electricity doesn’t matter, because when the number of miners/hash power go up, the energy usage by Bitcoin goes up the same.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:22:51
That article misses the fact that when bitcoin is used by a billion people instead of 1 million for actual payments, not trading , then it will use around 1,000 times more energy than right now (30twh/year), which is 30,000 twh/year, since more adoption always brings more
miners, as we could see in the last 10 years. 
That would be around 100 times more than the current banking system including personnel, electricity, commute etc. (100thw/year) 
Sure, maybe most of it comes from renewables, but it always takes away electricity from renewables that could replace coal plants already, so when Bitcoin exists at that scale, coal plants have to stay in operation to supply countries with enough energy. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:02:03
Just look at the hash power charts. There is very strong evidence that it is.
If you want to refute it, you need to have very strong evidence (not opinions) against it.
@_date: 2019-01-31 09:45:48
It’s in the article linked.
Mining always increases linearly with adoption, because more adoption, more miners. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:39:09
Of course, assuming the price stays at $3,000. But my whole comment was about Bitcoin serving 1,000x people than now at probably a 1,000x price increase. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:09:19
Mhm, selecting one miner as the winner is the same fairness as distributing the winnings between all miners (by completed work relatively)  only that you have the hassle with Mining Pools, no? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:53:17
If you do 2/11th of the work, sure, you should get 2/11th of the reward, what's the issue with that? 
Why would the pools invest less in hardware, they would still make the same money by mining minus the 1% fee.
Also, why is the network more secure with better hardware. An attack can just buy the best hardware and have an advantage over all the other miners with less sophisticated hardware?
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:53:11
But everyone does the work. This way, we wouldn't have the whole mining pool bs. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:17:56
Ah I see, a Bitcoin maximalist. No point in debating further here.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:53:33
They have the most decentralized blockchain architectures, much much more than PoW or PoS through sharding.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:39:23
Ok, but why is the winning miner then the only one getting the reward and not split between all miners, wouldn't that eliminate the need for mining pools?  
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:25:53
Many top 100 blockchains, e.g. Qkc, zil, ela, dash can’t be attacked this way. Soon, IOTA and HOT will follow.

@_date: 2018-04-02 21:18:24
Thank you, do you have a source for that and what do you mean by "current state" exactly. 
Also what do you mean by everyday usage, since the 50,000 TPS wouldn't get higher all of a sudden, since the majority of transactions have to cross numerous hops would they? What would be required to get from 50,000 to 300M like you specified? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 22:12:40


However, so can LN no? Which and advantages does sharding have over LN and why wasn't shareing picked as a scalability solution over LN for BTC then?

@_date: 2019-05-25 09:51:45


This is the main argument and irrelevant since the btc.con mining pool also has almost 35 times more hashpower in btc than in bch.


Since it didn’t crash bch, it probably also wont crash bitcoin. So, from a financial perspective it wouldnt be a harm to  btc.com, only to the part of the community that cares about long term immutability, which isn’t that big.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:22:12
You do have a point. Median transaction fee is $0.5-$1, so it’s around half of what I said.

This was the largest bitcoin mining pool that made this attack/reorg.
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:15:23
Yes, but with antpool, which has the same owners, it’s already 35% hash rate on bitcoin. They can increase their hash power briefly to 51% and it’s the same situation. Also, they are investors in viabtc who own another 6%. 
That’s no concern at all for the main miner in bitcoin who is very, very close to 51%?
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:03:56
Why not use Ethereum then that has lower fees, more nodes and isn’t centralized with ASICs?
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:34:07
Why do you then say “Look at this volume” when no dollar volume has changed? 
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:51:13
So, the biggest bitcoin mining pool just made a 51% attack. 
No one bats an eye, bitcoin security is great!
@_date: 2019-05-25 07:09:25
Because the largest bch mining pool is also the largest bitcoin mining pool and their owners don’t mind at all doing a 51% attack completely disregarding immutability of the blockchain whenever they please.

That’s not true at all lol. They have 19% ok btc and 24% on bch.
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:26:32
However, they did just that with BCH and they have 20x more hash power on the btc blockchain.
Do you have a source proving that they do that as part of their risk analysis and how many exchanges do that, because 95% of crypto exchanges are just really bad exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:36:54
And everybody believes it. 
It would take hours to days until it’s clear that a 51% attack has actually happened. The double spend attack has already concluded within 30 mins before anyone has checked their reddit.
