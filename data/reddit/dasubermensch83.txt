Well, I don't know what mergemining is, but to be clear: is it possible to reduce the power requirements of BTC without sacrificing security, or destroying its fundamental payout methods? 
Or, would a PoS coin simply exist as a side chain implementation, and people could use that if they wished?
Or is it something else I don't get.

I don't have time to google this, but considering the domain and power of the SEC, and keeping in mind the stakes involved, it seems likely that the SEC has bestowed an indirect benefit on every human alive today to some degree (vs an alternative of a completely unregulated/ un-watched/ un-policed largest financial market on Earth). 
Could they be better? Sure. Does corrupt shit happen on Wall Street all the time? Yeah, perhaps even within the SEC. But the fundamentals of having exchange oversight vs having none pretty clear imo.

Hmmm. Probably. 
Regardless, **average** power production is very, very dirty (ie it is hefty (25% or so) contributor to average individual carbon footprint). Being decentralized, BTC should be clean, if at all possible. No matter what, a large percentage of its mining energy will come from cheap coal. Even if its optimal to use hydro (for various reasons), ~40% of the worlds energy comes from coal, vs 5% from hydro. We must think in terms of averages, proportion, necessity, and timescales. Clean energy implementation will lag far behind BTC adoption, and expansion.  
**What I don't know** is how much energy BTC uses in total, and how that compares with other things (ie banks, other industries, etc). 


Yeah, that would be awesome. But clearly, there is *some* point at which energy spent mining BTC becomes frivolous human waste, even if it were technically profitable (think mining an asteroid for gold. It'd be tantamount to frivolous human waste even if it were profitable). I don't know at what point it becomes "wasteful". If BTC mining were profitable, but constituted 50% of human pollution, I'd argue that its too much. In practice I don't know what the "wasteful" inflection point is, but it exists. 
We should make BTC cleaner if there is no downsides, and we should start trying to quantify how "wasteful" is it sooner rather than later, so that we can think up solutions.

Whats your opinion of the anonymity of Darkcoin vs the anonymity of Dark Wallet?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:11:22
There is a very, very, very compelling case made that this is likely to be THE Satoshi. Its by no means concrete, but that makes sense if you read the article. 
Either way,I really feel terrible for the guy. The media just blew up a HUGE story which will bring massive amounts of media attention to a mid-sixty year old, privacy-crazed recluse, who is recovering from a recent stroke and prostate cancer. BTC inventor or not, this guys life is about to get turned upside down in a potentially lethal way. I really hope he was a heads up, and time to hide himself if that's what he wants. 
FWIW, I think they found the right guy

DRK has greater identity protection as its mixing feature is hosted on a decentralized network, and is built into the coin (eg it is not dependent on a browser add on like Dark Wallet, so there are far fewer attack vectors).
As you said, DRK there are only a few places to spend DRK at the moment. However, its a brand new coin, with a specialized feature in mind. It will likely only gain acceptance from retailers that value privacy as a primary concern (activist groups, political parties, porn sites, etc). Its a niche coin, which is part of the reason why there are so few of them. 
As far as p2p transfers go, DRK will probably end up being more anonymous than Dark Wallet because of the aforementioned reasons. Both are still in alpha/beta testing, so it will take time to play out. However, it can be reasonably argued today that DRK is more anonymous than BTC used with Dark Wallet. We'll see when they both come out of testing. 
I think for casual purchases at major retailers where you want to toss in a bit on anonymity, Dark Wallet will be better. For purchases/ transfers you want to make sure are anonymous, it will be better to use DRK.         
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:07:29
This coin could actually be useful if accepted by certain marketplaces...

...their browsers, hard-drive, computer, email accounts, identity, etc. You're right, but the argument is a non-sequitor. 
In 2-10 years time, its likely there will be software and hardware devoted to making crypto both more secure, and easier for John Everyman (a relative of J.C.U) to use without thinking too much.

I agree with this 100%, and you caught me on my silliness of my "Satan" claim. However, I think his style of argumentation, and modes of reasoning paint a text-book case of statements that should be taken with extreme discretion. IMHO, its very helpful in life to be able to notice such things right away.  
I am basing my claim that the OP is largely full of shit based on several factors. 
* Empirical evidence (ie the fact that he mentions that what he says may not be true, etc) 
* Deductive logic (ie his 100k/week scamming stat is probably made up because such large scams would be publicized on the forums/reddit) 
* Inductive logic ( If he causally makes up certain claims, he likely to make up other claims. Also, the title of this thread is that SR2 is larger than ever, and the largest dark market on the web. They probably would not be so if there were scamming people as obviously as is claimed).
* "Comparative logic" - My term. But, this guy sounds a lot like a crackpot. Constant alarmist tone, use of hyperbole, and grand leaps of logic (many) 
For the sheer joy of reasoning I have typed all this out, and went back to look for something which might back up my last claim. I didn't have to search long. The first words he typed:


Conspiracy theorist crack-pot much? There are numerous other examples. 
I should point out that I'm not worked up about the issue, just the (IMHO) demonstrably poor reasoning behind some popular claims.
Personally, I feel that if you can't afford to lose money buying drugs on the internet, then you can't afford those special drugs. My opinion. The quality control is great, and I'm very happy such services finally exist. I'm astonished that SR2 is paying people back out of pocket, grateful for their service, and admittedly take issue when people go on rants bashing a service I'd gladly pay more just to keep afloat. Scamming and poor service relative to competition shouldn't be tolerated, but the market will work all that out in time. Possibly getting scammed on DNM's is 100X better than buy drugs at shows. I take my drug use very seriously :-)         
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:50:09
The issue he is stating is pretty out in the open. It may not get intelligent discussion because the "attacks" are idiotic. Yep BTC can be stolen, wallets can be hacked, passwords can be forgotten, drives and paper can get destroyed, etc. Excuse me while I phone the New York Times

You might enjoy checking out independent studies on the accuracy of Wikipedia.

Actually, the fact that the man in the article's name really is (or was) Satoshi Nakamoto dramatically INCREASES the probability that the man described in the article is the inventor of BTC. Its because of conjunction. 
There very few people named Satoshi Nakamoto in the world, and only a few of them that speak English, and only a few of those are capable of coding BTC, and fewer still are in what was suspected to be the creator of BTC's age range (based loosely on evidence from his coding style). The man in the article meets all of these conditions.  
Now, which probability HAS to be higher: That the man in the article is the actual Satoshi Nakamoto, and creator of BTC (because he already meets all other conditions); or that whomever created BTC happened to select a random name that happens to describe a man that meets all of conditions of this real world Satoshi? The former.
I hope that's clear. There is a much more elegant and brief way to demonstrates what it is I'm trying to demonstrate. Apologies for teh fail.  
IF - and thats a big if with Newsweek - this story has full journalistic integrity (referring to process, not style and writing), I'd say they likely found the right guy.       
*Also: 
There are a few more conjunctives to add in there as well (personality traits, propensity to work working alone, writing style, motive to create BTC, window of opportunity, lack of counter-evidence etc, but these are harder to immediately quantify, but can probably be ignored because we've already narrowed down the potential candidates who meet the criterion of having the real name Satoshi Nakamoto AND who also have all the traits mentioned earlier).
I think they found him, poor guy...
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:20:14
because this is reddit. Counterpoints to the OP usually get down-voted. Pretty geh huh? Such much for reasoned discourse.

@_date: 2014-03-06 20:08:37
This is what I've been trying to discuss, because his credentials were anything but vaguely relevant, and I think quantifiable statements can be made concerning the article.
I'm super interested in actual replies by people who read this post.
Does probability theory have anything to say about the likelihood that that this story is true? 
Doesn't the fact that his name is Satoshi Nakamoto dramatically increase the chance that he is the creator of BTC because of conjunction? 
I mean either the creators of BTC chose a pseudonym that happens to be shared by a person who: 
Has the name Satoshi Nakamoto (1/millions)
AND Speaks decent English (1/15 people)
AND are in the right age cohort (~1/5 people) 
AND have the required intelligence to create bitcoin (1/50 people AT LEAST) 
AND have the required education (a further 1/30? etc) 
AND have motive/ ideology to create BTC (ie not everyone)
AND had a window of time, combined with lack of counter-evidence, to create BTC (huge smoking gun here if you quantify it. If he had been working on known projects, then the buck would stop there) 
In fact, all assumptions had to hold in order to create bitcoin, and this guy just happens to also be named Satoshi Nakamoto too. Thats unlikely. 
OR 
This guy is the creator of BTC. 
Something like that. 
My question is this: can the article be analyzed in a quantifiable, probabilistic way, assuming the facts are true?
The more I think about it the more I think concrete statements can be made. 
Discuss.

The concept can't be un-invented. Cryptos pretty much have to be widely adopted at some point, for some things. Cryptos have far superior functionality to normal money.
Will Bitcoin go busto or robusto? I don't know, and it doesn't matter. Perhaps bitcoin will be the altavista or cryptos, but the concept is here to stay as it serves a purpose.   
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:06:44
could be true but thats all short run. What we really need is to have SR or some other maketplace that does serious volume start to accept this coin. 
If any company, letit or otherwise, that deals with a client base that has privacy concerns and does a decent amount of business we're to start accepting DRK... to da moooooooo
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:44:05
Well this doesn't really apply to my question, but since you asked: no power generation is 100% clean (eg any reduction is cleaner), and electricity is till a limited resource (eg it could be used for other things).

No, hes ignoring your advice and insight because he thinks you are an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:15:06
No, its not "legitimate speculation" because he provides no sources to support his claims, and it is clearly just making shit up. Its obvious:


A few 100k a week? I think we would have heard about that. Where did he get this number? He just making things up. Sure, they could be true. A lot of things *could* be true, but this guys ramblings are a great example of what to ignore in life. 
Considering they know they're time limited (i.e no one has ever run a darkweb market forever) 
Spurious claim and poor reasoning. Darknet markets selling drugs have existed for less than 4 years. Also, in some sense, all of our time on Earth is limited. ZOMG. Time to be reckless and not think about the future!

What does that mean?

@_date: 2014-05-08 03:41:42
 &gt; So without the SEC, there would be no regulatory body at all?
That was a condition of my hypothetical scenario. This does not mean that if there was no SEC, I think that there would be no other regulatory body. 


These are part of what the SEC regulates, so even in my hypothetical, they would still exist.  


At least read the wikipedia article on the SEC. They do quite a bit more than Consumer Reports.  


Given the massive conflict of interest, its obvious that nothing would be done. Think of insider trading. Now imagine if there were no penalties for it. Financial trading markets are the worst conceivable arena for self-regulation, and it should be obvious as to why.


No. I'm not sure why you wonder that as it has little to do with my hypothetical scenario of an unregulated trading market. Though it sounds like a similar situation, your analogy is spurious.  
All in all I think you misunderstood my claim as much as you overestimated it. I never said there was anything magical about the SEC. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:02:06
In all due fairness, there a kernel of truth in what "tl;dr" is saying, and its worth taking a serious moment to consider it. 
A LOT of the cryptos are scam-coins, pump and dumps, half-baked ideas, or copy-coins. AND, many of the posts on this thread are thinly veiled attempts  to pump up the coin for the next 12hrs/ day/ whatever. So it goes, but it misses the point. 
Darkcoin is part of the larger, slow process of the evolution of crypto currencies, and their applications. Will it be the crypto of the future? Almost certainly not. Will it be around in a year or two? Maybe. I should hope something far better would be developed by then.
But todays Beta of DarkSend is pretty huge. It represents what this movement is: a free playing ground for building f-ing PROGRAMMABLE MONEY!  
To all the programmers who are making the movement happen organically, thank you, and keep going. 
   
@_date: 2014-05-08 03:54:54


No he didn't. He made claims; claims that lack actual evidence. Big difference. Also, its worth noting that his claims are both un-disprovable, and highly sensational. 


Sure, but so is the fact that I claim that SR2 is run by Satan. If true, pretty damning and noteworthy. 
The fact that he later goes on to say that he "doesn't know any of this for sure" (above), and then later still quotes actual number of how much scamming they are doing ("a few 100k a week") makes me suspicious that he knows anything at all. Mostly, the structure of all of his arguments are really bad. He makes several leaps of logic, and talks with near certainty in areas where he speculating wildly. These are tell-tale signs of congenital bull-shit factories. He talks in much the same way as other conspiracy theorists (chem-trail people, anti-vaxxers etc), and it likely to be mistaken for many of the same reasons. There's a good wiki article that spells out the erroneous reasoning, and logic common of conspiracy theorists. Good stuff. Helpful for critical thinking/ reasoning. This guy fits the bill to a T.


Thats cool, I had no idea :-)
