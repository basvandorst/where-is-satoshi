**[Asshole song:](
Well I was drivin' down I-95 the other night.
Somebody nearly cut me right off the road.
I decided it wasn't gonna do any good to get mad.
So I wrote a song about him instead.
It goes like this...
Were you born an asshole?
Or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way it worked out fine
'cause you're an asshole tonight.
Yes you're an A S S H O L E...
And don't you try to blame it on me.
You deserve all the credit.
You're an asshole tonight.
You were an asshole yesterday.
You're an asshole tonight.
And I've got a feelin'
you'll be an asshole the rest of your life.
And I was talkin' to your mother
just the other night.
I told her I thought you were an asshole.
She said, "Yes. I think you're right."
And all your friends are assholes
'cause you've known them your whole life.
And somebody told me
you've got an asshole for a wife.
Were you born an asshole?
Or did you work at it your whole life?
Either way it worked out fine
'cause you're an asss...hole tonight.

I am closing in on 60 and I have a pretty good handle on what bitcoin is.
the idea of stashing some $ into Bitcoin has a certain appeal, BUT, I don't like the fact that so many people have had their bc just vanish through stolen keys.
I missed the boat on mining and I don't think I could keep my computer secure enough.
    I know, Linode headquarters is two blocks away
    I'll keep em there! :0

This is an innovative idea.
I wonder who bears the liability burden on this property?
How is it ( or is it) insured?

I know this will be unpopular in this sub, but here I go anyway. Isn't this a lot like stiffing someone? Instead of giving actual currency that the waitstaff can use now, you will give them an obscure bit of digital info that you assure them is money, that just about none of them will have any idea of what it is, or how to use it and most importantly **how to keep it secure**. It will be a fairly trivial amount of money to justify the steep learning curve needed just to understand the whole concept.
What percentage of the population even knows what bitcoins are, or how to save, use and secure them? The answer has to be much less than 1% right?
Edit -- I guess I kind of missed the point of your premise that the waitstaff or establishment will take this initiative, thus they will be in the know about bitcoins, but it still feel you seriously overestimate how many people have any idea what bitcoin is and how to keep a computer secure enough to use it safely. I know that I have been using computers for nearly thirty years and I don't know enough to feel comfortable enough with computer security to be dabbing in btc.

Thanks for the link to the Entima.net pasphrase generator.
It does not seem to work for me ( Win xp, old dell laptop, firefox 23.0.1)
I followed this direction on the webpage:
Please move your mouse around in the window to generate enough random data to construct a secure passphrase.
I did that untill the green bar went across and now it says "waiting" and the generate passphrase button seems to be not clickable. Does it just take a long while?
