Or he's just too big a name to just come out and endorse something like this. He has talking points. They all do. People are either thinking way too much, or not enough.

Half of them probably never believed it to begin with. Agenda 101.

I like these threads. More interesting than the usual moon/crash/spammed blog article posts. Upvoted.

Does cryptocurrency = blockchain technology though? Also, it was clearly a lowercase "b".Your response just seems like it would only be appropriate for someone who specialized in the niche. Also, even if it was worded better, you probably wouldn't get a response just based on the fact that followup questions rarely seem to be answered in AMAs. He answered what he knew/only wanted to say. Your intentions seem reasonable though.

1. The question asked was clearly about bitcoins as a form of currency, not the network.
2. You insinuate he was confused. He answered the question about the currency.
3. Yes, you came off as somewhat dickish and/or having an agenda.
4. You could have just mentioned the open ledger part...but even here you come off as dickish with the words "Could it be?". This comes off as talking down.

Assuming you have a machine you can securely create paper wallets offline on I'd go for the printer. Get one without wifi and a hard drive for added security. You will have the flexibility to create all kinds of paper wallets which are IMO the best way to store coin long term.
