i see absolutely no way to corner the market in the first place let alone for there to be massive windfall potential. you're not even releasing any information. in a stock the most basic info would be in the prospectus, you wont even tell us about your series fundings.

Yeah that's kindve how business works. And they're regulated by the bank's charter, FDIC rules, and state laws. They don't get to just randomly keep certain people's deposits.
I mean, your line of thinking is severely misinformed and pretty ignorant. You wire money domestically from your bank and to their bank account, from where it is applied to your account. There's no room for it to go missing there. You can literally call the bank and confirm they received it. 
But keep thinking how you do.

How long to withdraw from them?

ITs not just you bro. I am cashing out gains for the month for bills and my last $1800 is stuck with 0 confirmations. I'm using bitflyer, not that it matters, but it looks like everything after 4ish EST is unconfirmed

This is not true. I am PMing you. I'll give you a contact at Coinbase's bank if necessary
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:41:02
What does that even mean, 'a massive problem statistically'?
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:30:26
Thanks a lot man! 
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:35:25
Wow. This guy is great in regards to bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:48:20
You. Are. A. Fucking. Idiot.
Crybaby of the week over here.
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:31:57
thanks man i think ill do that. once a backup is made and say I buy a new computer, how do i successfully import that wallet to the new pc?
@_date: 2014-11-12 00:31:19
the whole typing thing was idiotic on my part. I've used QR codes in recent times lol. Thanks for the input.
Are you using bitcoin core? I am trying to figure out how to find out my bitcoin address.

You have to research the signs of a bubble, it's following the graph pretty closely, unfortunately
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:00:43
Okay thanks for the info. I am using that android app. I totally understand what you're saying about it being on two devices. I'm just keeping the wallet that was assigned when I downloaded Bitcoin Core (did take 3 days to download, in fact). It's working, I sent a test from Coinbase to the wallet, works like a charm.
Just encrypted the wallet and then backed it up. The wallet that it saved is what is called my 'private key', right?
And thanks for the tip, man... you're a good guy.

Lol so now because you disagree with someone and how they operate their business, everyone else in the world should treat them as a pariah?
The fucking guy founded a company. He got large investors. Of course he fucking drank with him, that's how building a relationship with an investor works. What do you want him to do, continue to struggle instead of having made it?
@_date: 2015-01-24 06:45:18
So because he has a minority investor they aren't legitimate? Do you know how the world works?

What other options do I have than coinbase and localbitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-27 04:32:15
I'll be canceling my account tomorrow after reading this. I came to coinbase because I was sick of the banks. Way to ruin a good thing!
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:51:29
The space race hasn't even begun
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:42:08
So because of others I shouldn't be able to invest my money how I deem fit? Fuck off.
People like you are what's wrong with America.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:31:41
my bank account has been pending for almost a year. just logged in, still pending. what a joke.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:24:24
I won't be using Coinbase again, made my last transaction on there yesterday before I heard about this. They can go fuck themselves and stop requiring IDs like they're a bank and stop logging IPs, to say the least.
Local bitcoin is where it's at.
@_date: 2016-07-22 17:25:12
Obviously you don't know much about the war on drugs. They only go after drug users and street level dealers, that is a fact.
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:04:12
That's awesome. Happy to say I'm a Coinbase customer, especially with customer service like that.  hope you see this.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:23:22
I already said I'm using local bitcoin. Go troll somewhere else.
