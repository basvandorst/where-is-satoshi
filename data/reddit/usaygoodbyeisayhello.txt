If we continually have 100k unconfirmed transactions, this kinda thing is going to get more common.

Well the good thing is you're in the right place if you want customer support from Coinbase.

"nothing has changed"...Amazng how you can trivialize the last four years of Bitcoin with this statement. It's as if you have no idea what you're talking about. Are you drunk?

I'm still shocked that Circle thought there needed to be another PayPal in the world. Really, what is the point?

Coinbase is getting worse and worse. Now it regularly takes over an hour to process a btc withdrawal. For what reason could it possibly have to take that long? It's like they are trying to push people into ethereum.

I think it would be trivial for them to find out who you are just based on the title.

Who allowed naked shorting? How could you possibly have any evidence of that?

All you noobs apologizing for this guy have absolutely no idea what actually happened in the months leading up to closure of MTGOX. There where obvious problems with the exchange; bitcoin/fiat withdrawals were taking weeks to months to process and  Gox traded at a 10-20% premium. Karpeles continued to run the exchange, coming up with a bunch of bs reasons for the withdrawal issues. I remember one excuse was that the Japanese bank could only process 25 wires per day. It's unreasonable to believe that he didn't know they were insolvent, you cant't just lose 80% of customer funds and continue to operate normally, yet he continued to operate his exchange and take customer deposits up until the day GOX died. 
He was a coward that refused to face the music, so he decided to keep sipping fraps and banging Japanese whores - I can't say I wouldn't have done the same.
