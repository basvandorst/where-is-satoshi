It's not about being a putz. There are plenty of college kids and poor people out there. It's not close to 99%. I was trying to respond with a comment that mightvmake them feel better in case they fell into either category.

Well now I need an explanation from OP.

Tomorrow morning we will find out. If there is nothing by noon, I'm back in. Also, everything I do is wrong so just do the opposite of what I say.

If it's just 100. I would say buy 100 in scratch offs.

There are also people who said he was telling internal auditing to turn a blind eye to red taped mortgages  (those are usually the ones that have missed payments within the first 6 months and are flagged as no no's). He may have seen it because he was part of the problem and slowly realized they all fucked up when they were trading each other these shit mortgages. Should they have gone to jail? Maybe not, but they sure as shit shouldn't be in charge of such large companies.

Thank you, I've been asking on here for days, but it's hard to get past all the shitposts and non answers.

There is still time today for some up and downs.

When are the futures announced tomorrow? I don't have much, but ideally I'd lile to get out during this mini dip and get back in after. I've been on the hodl train with my eth and ltc, but if these futures are going to take a hit, I want to get out for that brief bit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:28:40
I'm not rich enough to just boy more right now so I pulled out so I can buy the dip, otherwise I'd be hodling and buying more bitcoin and ethereum

I'm not rich enough to keep buying and handle a correction. I can't handle how crazy this all is.

It reminds me of trees. Super fucking awesome in the beginning......we'll see if that lasts.

I'm surprised they still have fanboys. I liked some of their cars back in the day (fifth avenue) along with Buick, but can't really get behind either brand these days.
