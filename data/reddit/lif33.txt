What about garlic coin ? Or whatever it's called

Well it's not anonymous at all, you can view every transaction there was ever made.

I've been waiting for it to crash since like 3k :(

Umm all I can see is that non tech people started to invest because of all the media saying how much it's going up.
No one is actually using btc as a currency rn because of the ridiculous fees for transactions. I underpaid on bitpay yesterday by $0.50 on a $175 transaction. All I could do was get a refund which will cost me $16 in fees.
When the bubble will eventually burst everyone will start to hate Bitcoin. I dont see that as a good thing.

I remember when fees were ridiculous and my money making depended on a lot small transactions and low profit margins. Wasn't a good time.

I'm crying and laughing at the same time...

Carding and other fraud :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:09:52
You can do that using purse, even though is not an official way. You also get a discount on your purchase. Its kind of a shady website and there's a lot of carders exploiting it but it's good.

There are risks involved but when my order was bought using a carded account purse support gave me my money back. On the other hand purse support can be really bad for the people that order. Once, purse locked my account when I had £500 on it. I eventually got it back after emailing them for days.

The order was cancelled because Amazon detected something suspicious.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:17:54
Yeah I would advise you not to use purse. There are a lot of carders and if for some reason you seem suspicious purse will lock your account and they will keep all of your money. 
If Amazon sees that there have been a significant amount of items that were carded sent to your address then they will blacklist your address.

So how do I turn off these shitty Reddit notifications?

A giftcard that was bought using a stolen credit card. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:22:12
Like I said I already tried talking to purse. They dont respond, thats the only response i got. Suing them would be pointless because i would probably lose more money than its worth. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:18:38
Wait, if you think that everyone is using giftcards from stolen credit cards then why the fuck does purse exist? Purse is just as bad as the people carding because they are taking that money for themselves.
