How reliable are multipart sms messages?  of course on our 3/4G smartphones, we don't even think about them being multipart anymore but am I wrong to assume that this is purely based on my phone's ability to compensate for that?  The SMS protocol it self does not identify two messages as being related, or does it?

My only additional thoughts on it are that you should check with your lawyer, who is versed in crytpo beside the obvious FFL stuff.   
While I don't know of any issues with that currently, you don't want youknowwho come swatting if something changes. So at a minimum inform your legal counsel of the additional payment method, so he can give you a heads up if any regulations or laws change that might impact the FFL.    
Who knows, next month, bitcoin will be considered as a person by them ;) /s

my guess, having been at Bern's countless times, is that the report is not clearly explaining what Palmer meant to relay.  Not to mention, the article states that bitpay has not even talked to them, so the intro is pretty misleading.
Bern's success is not limited to good food, locally grown food but also a dining experience that is about the experience as much as the food. 
You don't have a 60mins dinner at Berns, you have a 4 hour dining event.   Nobody rushes you to order, the next course does not get served until the table is ready for it, you spending another 2 hours having conversation after the meal was served is never interrupted by "i'll just leave this check here for whenever you are ready = get out, so i can turn this table over"
While I have no doubt that they would adopt it, they just don't feel a need to do so today, as it is not providing anything towards the experience that is their business model.   Compared to Newegg, which will actually gain customers by embracing it, Berns is not visited by customers because you can order via an ipad, or accepting paypal or bitcoin.  
IMO, that is what the "traditional" comment was supposed to reflect, vs some 'OMG, not going to be caught using some new thingy from the intertubes'.  
You don't pay in silver or gold, for your dinner at Berns but with cash, check and CC.  (btw, that any bank could issue a Visa or Mastercard, did not come around until 1980, and Berns does except those.)
If crypto currency continues as I expect it to do, Berns will gladly take my coins a year from now, and there won't even be a single interview published about that fact.

Can you explain something to me, or point me in the right direction for some ELI5:
I checked out your first link to the list of p2pools. found one supposedly in my region, in my city even and the latency is +1600ms.   
My experience with latency is in regards to nationwide WAN/MPLS/P2P links and guess online gaming but 1600ms sucks even if they were located in Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City or Cape Town. From a pure ISP perspective, I should be looking at 10-20ms worst case.
The node shows zero users, so it could not have been an utilization issue. What gives?

Lots of dumb questions, due to lack of knowledge:
would it be possible to highjack the retailers internet connection/dns/APs/etc to force the verification to go to an alternate network, which will confirm the transactions regardless?
I don't quite understand how the verification works and what  failsafes are in place to ensure that you are talking to the legit bitcoin network
What about the merchant having their own miners and send the verification requests to them, could that speed up the process?
Will offering larger transactions fees increase the speed significantly?

the upload part seems to be a significant issue that they need to resolve first. "optional link to internet" as they had drawn in the diagram on their site, is a pretty big hole in their plan, imo.
after reading up on how mobile banking works in kenya now, it is all based on their mobile service provider being the  equivalent of the wallet, the ones that control access to the GUI and providing the trusted blockchain. 
so how are you going to convince them to undermine their own business model, if indeed you were to even trust them to do it in the first place. which would kinda defeat the purpose and goal anyway.

Based on any hardware you can buy today, or pre-order, either calc says there is no way to make any ROI, or profits exceeding a few $100, even if you drop $10k today.  
I have no reason to doubt the math but why is anyone even bothering to sell/buy the hardware, when genesisblock even says that you can't make money. 
Ppl don't pre-order 10k in hardware from a group of vendors that has failed more often than kept on target, know that it is a bad investment. But somehow they still sell out.  
There is a disconnect in the market logic for me.  
Yes you can scam ppl into buying $2k hardware at a sufficient rate to make your money back but that only works for so long. 
Unless there is profit in there that is not showing up in the calcs or being discussed anywhere. There is only one outcome....the hardware market imploding.
I went from looking at $200 hardware, all the way to considering preorder $10000 hardware. Even the worst calcs, say that I will not make significant money. 
Every post on reddit says, DON"T BUY ANY ASICS.
if i assume there is some hidden profit nobody talks about, at this point all this talk against buying miners will cause this to be a hardware-bubble about to burst. which is not good for the capital that needs to flow into the over all bitcoin market, inorder for it to succeed.
if the negative talk is just to keep more asics from entering the pools, that will kill the little competition there is in hardware market.  Which will work against the whole distributed concept of bitcoin, which in turn will hurt general adoption.  bitcoin has to continue to expand in the current adoption rate to not eventually  implode.  It simply can't become stagnant, if the goal is global adoption.
If there is truly not a profit, and everyone that is still wasting money on new hardware today, will see that they lost money by the end of 2014, causing the bubble to burst.
then you look at the gpu mining, yes there is decent profit but how long will AMD continue to sell at msrp, when used and abused gpu's are going for double.  That is the same selfdefeating path, just not quite at the same stage as asic hardware.
If i continue to believe in the principal of bitcoin, and assume that the speculations on its mining will not be the cause of its early demise, all I see in the future is a huge market adjustment. The trouble with that is, if it comes too soon, there will be too little incentive for people to stick with it, to allow it to recover.  We all watched the housing market, big difference is, nobody needs bitcoin to sleep well at night and to stay out of the rain. 
I really want to be wrong but if there is as much potential trouble at the smallest and highest segment of the economy(the miners) as is being portrait here and one other forums, how can i expect adoption/success at the lowest and largest segment (consumers) to reach critical mass?
sorry for the rant, but I am rather frustrated with the current state of not being able to simply support the bitcoin network unless I am willing to take a huge loss.   And the buy&amp;hold approach can't be considered a smart one, if any of my impressions are even remotely accurate. As I would just be supporting an extension of time for other people to fail at a ROI and waste their money.
**tl;dr  the current mining economics alone, are making me doubt about viability of a long term bitcoin economy**
i probably should have used another account, as this will probably destroy my karma LOL  :)

First, I like what you are doing here, however the concept above means that the more BTC I have, the more say I have about what direction things will take.  
In micro-payment funding for altruistic goals, like feeding the hungry, this approach is fine and the best idea will bubble to the top by these means (most times).  However now we want to vote by btc contribution on things that are ultimately there to represent me and my goals....
In its current state, one could make the claim: yea but even the ppl with the most btc today were all cpu miners at one point, or at least a majority of them were. So the goals of the greater community would be protected by their mindset (ignoring, for a moment, that money corrupts).
But as the goal is global acceptance, the closer we get to that goal, the greater the chance that you will have the current fiat elite, simply buying voting power with a single trade. 
now you are right back to where we wanted to escape from.
I am not claiming to have the answer here but I think that needs to be considered.
thoughts?...I hope you or someone can proof me wrong because I want it to succeed just as the next person.

@_date: 2014-03-06 06:34:42
:)  I think that there will end up being a natural balance between the current freeforall of bitcoin and then how merchants will accept btc.   You already see this happening now.  Coinbase is used to limit the extreme fluctuations, merchants require that you use coinbase...or only offer coinbase based transactions to limit their exposure.  As long as this does not turn into "all US customers have to use Coinbase" due to some fed regulations, the care principals are not really violated however, if nobody is able to compete with coinbase in the long term, similar to paypal, the risk is that the .gov could simple make up laws to force coinbase to place restrictions on btc transactions just as they do now with banks/fiat/CC transactions.

One S2 split by 18 ppl for $200 each...nope.   
I am not opposed to the idea but not on those terms.  
That amount should get us two S2's with coins to spare.  
$3600 at 590/btc = 6.1 btc


If you can do escrow until units are up, I'll commit to at least one $200 1/18 share for two S2 units for 6 months. However we need to come up with something else to make up the 0.85 difference. Maybe lease the rig for another 12 months. Not sure if selling it will recovery enough.
But keep this going, I am not opposed to it.

that is actually far more intimidating than your original application(which already made me cringe for the security of our networks, that any tipchange could be a bot command)
I say intimidating not because of the risk of it being used to cause harm but because even to this day, security is an afterthought and mostly reactive. 
How long will it take that someone will watch the blockchain and successfully analyze it for most bot commands? A year or two. How long until it is standard feature in all security and operating systems? 3-5 years?  seeing that 2fa is still not a standard, probably even longer. 
By then, we would in theory already have countless undetected AI's growing up to maturity on the blockchain, before anyone even considers that a reality. 
i may change my mind about the possibility of an AI threat to humanity.

if you add fake paper money, there is still that similar risk with cash.  At the checkout lane, you can doublespent simply by having made a copy of the $50 bill. 
The merchant take that risk now. Which is why most merchants are willing to pay the CC fees and CheckVerify fees. Of course that is passed to the consumer in their product prices but if they didn't use the systems, the average loss due fake cash would also be added to the prices. 
So what do merchants do, they may not accept bills larger then $20. Or they take the extra time to check every bill to ensure it is not fake...this takes time. Imagine you were buying a car with cash and handed them $5k in 20s....that certainly will take longer than 6 verifications for btc.
with the criminal law being set out to make counterfeiting a very risky venture, most counterfeiters won't bother faking 1/5/10/20's. So the merchant has less exposure per transaction on smaller transactions and less chances of anyone actually trying to spend fake money due to the risks/payoff.
so there are some similarities, i think

I am not sure I can compare this to what Slingbox provides.  This to me looks like true Internet TV.  Slingbox still requires a local tv provider (with all the contracts and subscription limitations) or DISH to send you the signal, so you can 'sling' it over the internet.  And you needed Slingbox(or compatible) hardware, which in this case you do not(popular media streamer or browser or smartphone is all that is required). 
This is not a great deal for ppl that are content with their cable subscription but it is huge for cordcutters.   
For cordcutters, there have not been great options in two TV genres, live sports and live news. If you look at the subs/forums, that is probably the most frequently asked question.   
I get what you mean by virtual slingbox(w/o std TV subscription in this case) but I think by referencing another product/market segment, it slightly undervalues what they are proposing to offer here. 
The brand-name choice is pretty weak though, as way too many ppl will assume it is tied to Sling hardware+TV subscription. At least they left the DISH branding out of the product. 
We shall see how this turns out, they certainly seem to have the right market segment targeted but if they are going to hit the mark....time will tell.

**not an expert** 
but from what I gather, it is due for an adjustment, the increase in the last two years is just feeling too bubbly for everyone's bloodpressure.  
In addition the irrational panic when the feds decide to raise interest rates even just a tiny bit: "omg it is all over now, sell sell sell"
then you got the oil thing happening....can't speculate on it long term, even short term is a gamble. OPEC could reverse its current course of trying to wipe shale and russia of the map; russia could become more aggressive in response to sanctions or collapse; EU's economy while being in the dumps it props up the dollar, this could quickly accelerate or decelerate based on russia's action; china could fail to resolve its recession issues, or they turn it around and push the value of the dollar back down, and cause anyone shorting some trouble.   
Add the uncertainty in the rest of the energy market, if alternate sources reach grid parity+ sooner/later than predicted it could enhance any of the fallout from OPEC's actions.
At the same time, individual scenarios could cancel each other out. 
All this makes it rather unpredictable. 
I think if you could remove OPEC and Russia out of the equation, it would be much closer to normal risk levels.  Their recent unprecedented action seem to be multipliers of usual risk factors.
again, I am not an expert.....just my novice impression.  So if you got some more qualified thoughts, I am happy to change my impression.
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:11:37
Live news and sports is really the crux of cordcutting when you don't have OTA channels to provide that. In Sarasota, we had a 24/7 news channel but I have not found that in other FL cities. 
as for the discovery shows, I have found that PBS has far better quality content over all but also that any show on Discovery is on YT withing days. As long as I get my fix of history and science shows, I am not that picky. Witha good antenna, I get to pick up the ota from other cities, so I am not even stuck with my cities PBS-style schedule. And NASA tv broadcast is always a bonus too. I had to pay extra for that on cable when it is OTA in FL. 
Scifi, yea that is a niche that only the internet sources will fill until someone puts it on netflix style services. However, I think Scifi would do well if they partner with DISH, as the demo certainly fits.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:47:29
ok, cool.  thanks for the quick reply
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:25:12
it is but this is just the first step, imo. Consider the forced upsell on all residential tv options.  With this you don't need a home to get service at, just so you can watch it anywhere.    
This is a big deal to cordcutters. While I could do without ESPN, the kid loves it, the wife has been missing HGTV since we cut the cord, and I get at least one 24/7 news channel.  I will likely get more hours-streamed/$ out of this than Netflix. 
BTC or not, this at its face value is a significant shift in content delivery offerings.   Which will lead to changes in the content providers offerings down the road, making it more affordable per channel eventually. 
is it the best I had hoped for...no, certainly not but it shows that they are finally moving towards the mindset of catering to customers that simply don't want to pay $200 for 1000 channels. 
the next company will likely offer a better selection or more diversified selection of packages.

right, that's the point. Joe Consumer relies on banks to keep their money save and secure until they spend it, as they are unable to do it on their own. As much as people cannot afford a $3k safe bolted into their foundation, nor are they able to keep their computers secured, recognize online threats, or have any means of recovery if an online wallet gets hacked or lost.
edit:  Hence not having means of storing bitcoins with an insurance protecting the consumer from potential loss, seems to me a hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to become a global currency.

If you lost 50% on an investment, nope.  If you lost 50% on a gamble, certainly. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:59:44
I was not trying to imply either. Whether you invested in bitcoin or you gambled in bitcoin, nothing inherently wrong with either.  
If I gambled, I just lost $1000, bummer :(
However, if I gambled, I was willing to come away with nothing from the start. Coming away with 50% is not too bad.  I can't claim that every vegas trip allows me to return with only a 50% loss. 
If I invested, I just lucked out and bought more bitcoin at a 50% discount. And continue buying as much as I can get. Can't ask for a better x-mas gift. :)
You don't sell low and take a loss, you buy more to sell high. 
All I am getting to is, that I have to look at it one way or another, I can't freak out over a $1000 loss, when I am being presented a opportunity to buy at a great rates. If so inclined, I just buy enough at 50% off, to make up the $1000 loss the next time it moves up 10%.


if you are not buying bitcoin for investment purposes, and I guess, based on your comment, you prefer gambling with bitcoin. 
Which is fine, good for you. Glad to hear that you have the funds to gamble with. Gambling is fun, I like it and gamble whenever I can. 
But why are you worrying about something you consider being addressed to the investors, if you don't have to worry about investing and are able to just have fun gambling with bitcoin?
I suspect you just cashed out on a 18% return in fiat over the last 24 hours. Your gamble was a safe bet, and you banked a ton of cash over it.  I bet you covered the losses of three mid level investors, just by being willing to gamble when everyone was busy freaking out or busy buying while it was cheap.

As someone pointed out recently, insuring bitcoin deposits at this stage of volatility is difficult (i don't agree that it is impossible).  Is the lack of insured deposits, ie what you consider getting with a traditional banking institution, a barrier that needs to be overcome in order to get BTC fully adopted as a global currency instead of an investment option?
