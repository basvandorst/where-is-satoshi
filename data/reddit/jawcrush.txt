It’s no different than your phone listening to you if it’s anywhere in the room

Because prison and a $250,000 fine isn’t fun after you’ve been audited

I had a hard time figuring out how to set up my ledger nano S. It didn’t come with instructions and had to learn from watching YouTube videos which weren’t always accurate. There’s no way anyone without a computer background would be able to set this up easily. Not good for adoption

Could someone put a bug in the code and crash it all?

Because it was invented by aliens

I’ve built computers as well as mining rigs. It took me hours to get it set up. It wouldn’t work on my laptop that was a google chrome book, it didn’t tell you which wallets to use for the numerous coins I had, and you shouldn’t have to take wallets off your ledger because there’s only room for a couple at a time. This should be easier to use than Coinbase if you want it to go mainstream (the wallet). Definitely not something my mother could ever figure out

It’s not as bad as a fraud claiming to be the mastermind behind crypto, confusing and scaring away potential investors with his childish antics.

Send it to me and I’ll find out

As long as you keep it in crypto and don’t deposit it to your bank

I’ve had numerous issues with ledger. I’m sure they’ll get much better as time goes on
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:07:12
What kind of issues?

Obviously a guy who has put very little time and effort into studying crypto.

It’s not as easy as it should be. It will get more simple over time. But if you’re talking about an investment that could be worth a fortune one day, people should take the time to learn it
