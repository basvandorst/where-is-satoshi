Thanks for the post. Certainly something I'll be looking into. This is the first year I'll have to claim btc on my taxes, so I figured it was going to be a nightmare anyways. Shouldn't be too much more trouble to have my losses deducted as well. 
Quick question if you know. How are natural exchange losses handled? Let's say I lost $5K exchange trading this year, is a portion of that deductible as capital losses? 
I'm aware I should know these things as a trader, but I already have a tax accountant on retainer for the year, and I stay I  touch with him. We just haven't sat down to go over all the details just yet

Again, thanks for the great info. 
My tax accountant is supposedly one of the best (possibly only) one around that is knowledgeable on crypto. He's mentioned several times that he has significant btc and Ltc holdings, so I'm sure he'll get me sorted out. 
We're in the midst of determining if I qualify as a trader for tax purposes. Apparently my trading on unverified accounts that I can't prove where mine (although obviously I believe I could) could lead to some issues in that regard. 
Ill get it all ironed out but I've got you saved, so I may reach out sometime if I feel like my guy isnt completely up to speed

I think you're mistaken. You can purchase and store BTC through Circle. It's, in essence, a wallet (one you shouldn't store large amounts of funds on).  
You can send USD to someone via Circle with your BTC balance. If I'm mistaken I'll come admit as much once I have time to check.

But If I have a bitcoin balance in Circle, I would assume I would be able to use that to pay a friend in USD? It's not a BTC-BTC transfer, but it could help one pay their non Bitcoin friends with their BTC holdings. So I'd say that's something (unless it will not in fact work that way).

In my experience, PayPal won't help. 
I had the same thing happen to me. Over the coarse of 2 months, a guy bought about 7 BTC from me and paid via PayPal. He was able to charge back almost all of it and I was left with an empty bag. 
Also, if those *are* charge backs, they will also charge you $20 per if they don't find in your favor.

I think it varies depending on circumstances. I've setup dozens over the past year and sometimes they demand one and sometimes they don't. I'm guessing it's IP or Region specific, but I have no idea.

Have made much more off of BFX margin trading and the random 1+% redemptions than I ever would have trading BTC this year. I bought a large number of tokens at $0.27 and withdraw every other asset. My haircut is long gone and I could sell my BFX at market price and be up over 50% this year.
Not making excuses for the huge fuck up that happened on their watch, but I was able to turn an all around shit show into a very profitable situation.

I didn't go as far in as I could have and I still regret it. I've been using profits from polo trading to roll into more BFX though. I'm pretty confident that we'll see full redemption, and I've got the time to wait if it takes longer than anticipated.
