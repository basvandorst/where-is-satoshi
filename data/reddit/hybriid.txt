That might be a strategy of those who got the world money for those who don't. 
The richs sell their bitcoin and scare the poors. Price went down. Then the richs buy again their coins and other's coins, and raise price, so that gradually they just might end up using it.
What do you think?

Yeah! two -1 votes but are you capable of improve the system? Instead of simply vote -1 give feedbback morons -.-

Buy the coins, buy the product and here you have your 5% fee.
If only i could convert $ to BTC at 0% i would buy all with it.

Im going to give my point of view about that.
I think that bitcoin value is still undervaluated. Think about this two concepts:
The overall wealth in the world (resources, goods and services)
Then think about a dollar value for all that things (10000000000000000$ maybe some more 0?)
Now introduce bitcoin to this.
The equation in mi mind is the following:
With that I dont mean all the money has to be converted to bitcoin, you know that a society NEEDS taxes, because you use the same roads as me, do you?. And surely you want these roads sustain their quality. But I don't think it's overrated at all, it has so much potential.
We need some kind of sustainability and more active consciousness with the world we are on. Wake up!

If you read the title it's a TALE, mr. genius of irony. 
Instead of simply throw away my work, why don't give you a better feedback, or comment the multiple failures that seem you see here, or why you think this can't happen? It took like more than one hour to imagine and write and i shared it with illusion, and you just few sec to discard. Is so easy to criticize without contributing anything.....Maybe it's simply you just can't imagine such wonderful things, because it is assumed that there are going to be always bad people in the world, or what?.

Artificially inflate? If you buy it means that you give it that value maybe?
Or you're just an speculator who what to buy cheap and sell expensive?
It depends how you see it...maybe I got u? ;)

Essentially true story of how Spartan king Leonidas led an extremely small army of Greek Soldiers (300 of them his personal body guards from Sparta) to hold off an invading Persian army now thought to have numbered 250,000. The actual heroism of those who stood (and ultimately died) with Leonidas helped shape the course of Western Civilization, allowing the Greek city states time to organize an army which repelled the Persians.
So yes, the spartans finnaly win :)

That's the reason why I say that a society needs taxes. A regulation of bitcoin can be done if people want. But are you sure that people really want? 
Imagine that:
12 April 2035
* A new bitcoin NGO (Non-governmental organization) stats a revolutionary movement, becoming the first alternative to organize a society voluntary. They bought an 8000ha. island of San José (Panama) and this is their project:
 -We are going to make a complete new society based on equality. Thanks to our prototype city has the last technology innovations, we adopted the cryptocoin currency bitcoin as the main exchange medium for the economic system. 
The city is also completely resource independent, as we use 100% renewable energies, we dont need oil or any other kind of fossil fuels, besides city is clean. Food is guaranteed to all people living in the city thanks to an automatic farm and automatic production systems that don't even need to be controlled by humans. Nor supervised.
The city works as a unity, and all the essential works needed to sustain the city are controlled by a powerful informatic system that is constantly analyzing any failure or malfunction with the millions of sensors in the city, and assign the task randomly to any person or group of persons which has the ability to solve it.
The rest of the "non-vital-works" (but necessary) are deided in popular assemblies, so the "populus" decide the way forward to de city. All the works recieve a proportional amount of money, depending of it's difficulty, and is asigned to those who can and want perform it. All the possible conflicts are resolved basing on a (random) algorithm, so luck. The work journey is of 4 hours/day, so people have free time to perform basic tasks like being with family, hobbies and enjoy life.
Returning to economic distribution, each villager Bitcoin adresses are linked to his house, and all the people can see the transmitter and receiver of all transactions, and the balance of all accounts. Depending on that, you pay a monthly tax rate, that is used for paying the essential works, and the surplus is shared to invest in new social resources.
This is a society based on confidence, and open to everyone who wanna join until the capacity of the ecosystem of the island is full.
For me that is the most egalitarian system i could imagine.Of course it is full of troubles because this is just a basic idea, and that kind of system will NEED good and wise people.

Well, i have to agree that, thay are not smart money, like i'm not too. But i dont need to be smart money to like bitcoin, and invest in it. It's a high risk investment, but for that condition you are not going to put there all your savings, do you? I think bitcoin it's a balancing currency:
FIAT-&gt;Unlimited 
FIAT-&gt;Centralized power
FIAT-&gt;Fee based system
Bitcoin-&gt;FREE based system
Well...think that's enought. For that i think that we are going to see a distribution of 50%-50% between FIAT and Bitcoin.

Personally i like 
The price seems grow up again! 
That might be a strategy of those who got the world's money for those who don't. 
The richs sell their bitcoin and scare the poors. Price went down. Then the richs buy again their coins and other's coins, and raise price, so that gradually they just might end up using it.
What do you think?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:51:24
Seems legit, almost you dont blame me. Although the story is long and not very funny, it make you dream i think.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:01:36
Hey hey hey hey...you are going soooo fast. Crash??? Before anyone of you (and me) knows bitcoin, it was 20$ half year ago. What crash? It is &gt;80$ right now. I'm not a college "economist wannabe" or a "bitcoin religious nut" but i think i see the things with objectivity.
The problem is that people today are too impulsive and want the things "right here right now".
Just an opinion.
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:51:15
I can aswell in Barcelona, Spain. You "just" have 4 continents already :D
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:26
This is just an idea i have, i think that buying Bitcoins is just moving money from FIAT (And the banks who control the system) to the people. Before just give that message -1, please shareyour opinions so i can learn too.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:30:45
Need to point there is no short term for exchanges to do this. Maybe now they dont want, but if 6 months later noone uses bitcoin, then what?

LoL...Are you in a parallel dimension?
