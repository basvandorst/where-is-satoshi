No, coinbase crashed because so many people were buying and selling frantically and it got overloaded.  Gdax also crashed.

That is awesome.  I wish pineapple's could fix my miserably failing retaining wall haha.  For real though, [No Longer Fatherless]( is small organization in my area that is doing some tremendous work in young men's lives that really need a good male role model.  I know they could use some funding if there is more pineapple juice left.

This would be awesome.  I can only assume it will be no where near me and impossible for me to travel to due to our budget, but just seeing the posts on Reddit would be awesome.

We all are a little mental.  Don't let these turds get to you.

Does the speed or any other functions show to the driver without them having to turn their head and look at the screen?  Like, does the turn signal illumination for a left turn show up in the driver's right eye on the left side of that screen?  If so, that is a massive human factors error waiting to happen.

How does this tip bot work?  I remember the old ones but none of mine work anymore.  Do I need to download something or open a different account to tip people?

I believe it is enough security.  I have countless friends with well over 10,000 in coinbase and none have had a single problem.  Coinbase also allows you to trade limits on gdax as well if you decide to do so.  I have a recurring payment of $25 a week that goes into bitcoin.
If you decide to cash out, you sell it on coinbase and then transfer it out to your bank account.  You do not have to put a credit or debit card on file, but doing so allows for immediate access to your currency.  If you do it through a bank account it has a 5-7 day validation time due to your bank.  That goes for both purchasing with a bank account and transferring funds back into the bank account.

Yes that is absolutely what I meant. Sorry, writting these while is sit in class! Thanks so much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:49
You can simply link a savings or checking account to coinbase from your bank.  You do not have to put down your credit card info.  They can draw straight from your bank instead of it being processed through visa, mastercard... etc.

I am contacting each one of the individuals listed here.  I have less than $1000 on the exchange which would be horrible to have locked in my case.  I can only imagine what you are going through.  Please update us on any new information and best of luck.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:44:14
I put $450 bucks in two months ago.  I didn't own that much.  It is now worth well over $1000.  I am putting another $50 in today.  I do not believe there is a "bad" time to buy bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:19:11
Awesome!  Thanks so much.  I am semi-new as well.  Started around a year ago.  I only have around $1000 worth of bitcoin because school and six month olds are expensive when done at the same time.  Here is to hoping that thousand keeps going!

Imagine you have a bank. Any time someone wants to trade money (bitcoin) they come in and hand it to a teller (node) where the money is checked to make sure it abides by the law (blockchain) before being handed back to the other user.
Well the bank is growing rapidly so there are a lot of new tellers. All the tellers before checked the money in the same way because everyone was trading that currency (bitcoin). Now a few guys decided they wanted to have a new "better" currency (blockchain: s2x) but these old tellers wouldn't be able to check their money transactions because they don't understand it. So new tellers (nodes) were added to the bank.
Now not many people around the town understood the new currency so they avoided it. And they didn't trust it because only a few tellers at the bank were going to be checking it. So Richy McRichpants who owns the general store (Amazon) decided he wanted to try and help the new currency. So he "buys" 20 new tellers that are trained for the new currency because he wants the new currency to be adopted and spent at his store. 
Hope that kinda helps.
Edit:  Thank you so much for all the support! And thank you for the gold!!!  Someone asked about tipping me in bitcoin so I am putting it on here, by no means am I asking for free handouts, I'd rather you offer to buy your next cashier a candy bar or a drink and make their day better.   12W73hvcDrnuu46cG2NjFk6tFjsvCXxHFr
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:00:38
That is what I thought but I felt it would be harder to explain it like that.  Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:17:18
No problem.  Offer to buy the next cashier you encounter a candy bar or a drink.  It may cost you a buck, but just the offer will make their day, whether they take you up on it or not.  Do something nice for someone :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:30:23
Gdax does support s2x as far as their announcements are concerned.

Someday, my 3 bucks worth to you may be worth a million.  When it is, we can give back to the other guys.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:35:48
Something small my wife and I do (very little extra money) is that we offer our cashiers a candy bar or a drink anytime we encounter someone behind a counter.  More times than not, they decline, but once in awhile someone does and that extra buck I spend buying them a candy bar makes them so happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:34:01
My rent is also due today, however I will have just about a months worth or rent left over after I pay mine.  I'll send a few bucks worth your way as well.
Edit: I sent about 3 bucks worth I think.  I don't have much but get yourself a cheap beer on me :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:34:45
Yeah.  Basically they are gonna try and convince you that your transaction was not certified and they can help verify it.  It is basically for scamming grandmas whose 16 year old wants bitcoin for Christmas so they put some money in a coinbase account and don't understand what they are doing.  Then the prince of Zimbabwe takes their bitcoins before Christmas like a full on scrooge. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:43:30
Yes, coinbase.com
Everyone likes to shit on it here.  It is simply the easiest and best way to purchase bitcoin, ether, or litecoin for a new user.  If you do a substantial amount, look into getting a hardware wallet.  But if you are going to be doing a smaller amount, less than a few thousand, I would not worry about all the trouble.  Coinbase is very secure and does a good job keeping the users informed.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:32:39
Made a few dumb mistakes this past few days.  Lost $100 bucks from my total of $1000 I had. Here is to hoping I can get it back eventually. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:26:47
Ahh this is a common scam.  If you send me your bitcoins instead I will make sure they stay safe from the IRS.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:51:53
No problem.  And if you are serious this is my bitcoin address, 
you can send small amounts through coinbase or whatever application you use to store crypto-currency. 
Please do not feel obligated to tip me, but it is always more than appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:09:57
Someone cannot hack into your hardware wallet.  It is like a usb drive you keep in your dresser or ideally a safe at home.  Right now, most of these places like coinbase are fairly secure, however, as bitcoin gains steam more people are going to attempt to hack in and steal your bitcoins.  It is the same as keeping your cash in a bank (coinbase) or keeping it in a jar buried in your yard.  It is more likely that you will lose money from the bank being robbed than by some random person coming on your property digging holes and getting lucky when they would have no idea you even buried it in the first place.  If that makes sense.  Both are pretty secure, but one only you know about.
Buying now or after the fork is 100% speculation.  Just like all of bitcoin.  It is not like a stock where you can look at the company, look at the tangible assets and make a decision.  It is still semi-new, it is still changing and people are just now starting to understand it in masses.  
Here are two trains of thought, I will let you make your own decision.  First, buying before the fork nets you an equal amount of s2x as your bitcoin.  This could be awesome.  Say you have 1 bitcoin now, after the split you would have 1 bitcoin and 1 s2x.  Best case scenario, they are both worth a lot, you sell one, and make a decent amount of money off of it. Worst case, you have two forms of currency fighting for validation and they both lose some value (no one knows how far the value could fall)
Second option, you wait to buy them.  Right now, the price is pretty high (possibly because people want to get free s2x).  This means after the fork, the price on bitcoin or s2x could drop significantly once the blockchain has established which currency will continue.  It will go up in the future after this point and after more people embrace the blockchain.
Buy now at a high price and be rewarded with two potentially nice currencies and make some money, but also risk a significant drop in the value of both and lose money.
Buy later and miss out on being rewarded with the new currency, but potentially get the better of the currencies at a better price.
Up to you my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:50:42
People want you to have a hard wallet, paper wallet, or whatever.  If you are just starting buy a coinbase account and purchase through there.  The split has not happened where the new currency is here yet, that happens on the 18th.
Basically, on the 18th, if you have bitcoin in your bank account, the teller begrudgingly will give you an equal amount of the new currency as you have bitcoin in your savings account.  At that point, it is up to the people to decide which teller they want to transfer their money with, the new or the old.  If more embrace the new, the old will start to fade away.  If more embrace the old and devalue their new currency, it will fade away.
Right now, if you buy through coinbase, you will be buying the original currency.  They will be on the normal blockchain.

It will automatically put it into an account for you.  For now on gdax you have bitcoin, litecoin, and ether.  After the fork you will have bitcoin, s2x, litecoin, and ether in your gdax account. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:18:26

I have it on my mac. Built a new pc and I dont remember how to get it on there. It just sits in the bottom left corner while you are typing. If you want to add bits you click it and type how much.
