I have doubts as to whether people will want to bother adjusting to a deflationary currency. But I'll cross my fingers, because I really want bitcoin to catch on.

It isn't. Finding the hash that solves the block is solving the block. Every time your computer hashes, a hash is "found." A hash is just a number that results from an algorithm. When your computer generates a hash that meets certain requirements, it sends it out for verification. That's what the message was about.

Source? I tried looking but couldn't find anything.

Regardless of what killed it, it is still dead. 
EDIT: Also, I don't know about you, but I would rather carry lightweight paper money instead of heavy pieces of gold.

There is no such thing as a fake block. There are hashes your computer comes up with; only the right one of the right difficulty level counts and unlocks a new block in the chain. Your computer saying, "Hey pool, I found a hash!" and the pool saying, "That's nice, but it is not a good enough hash." doesn't affect the rate at which your computer hashes.

I think he thinks the mining pools somehow create fake work for mining clients to do.
