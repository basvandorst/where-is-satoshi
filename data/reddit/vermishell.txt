Sounds bullish AF. The news is three days old, how come no one talks about this?

Same here, could you decrease the minimum deposit to like 0.001 to prove that this site is not a scam?
I have 2.8 BTC credit from free tickets, but I'm not believing any of it. Definitely NOT sending you 1 BTC to try it out. If someone wants to try their luck withdrawing the 2.8 BTC I can give my user id and pin for a fraction of that credit balance :P

Why not give the btc back yourself then? Start with me. It´s a small amount but would mean the world to me.

How can I send feedback to the developers? I want to send a zillion emails to get them working on LTC support.
