Interesting.  Curious to know if your account is suspended, frozen or your locked yourself out.  In any case, if you opened a support ticket, it will get resolved.

Out of the thousands of cheques we have wrote, it's the only occasion this oversight has ever occurred.  Since the demand is on the CAD orderbook along with CAD fundings and withdrawals, that's where users will noticed the majority of options available to them.  If anyone were to  write their name and deposit the cheque in their name we'd do a trace and have the bank investigate.  Plus, since we have a carbon copy proving the cheque was blank and the error was on our end, we'd gladly issue a new one for the customer in the unfortunate event a someone would take the risk to make it out to themselves and cash it.

Sometimes the bank sends us a code that indicates that we have to hold the transfer for manual approval. If we do not, we lose Interac processing altogether. If you happen to experience a hold is most cases you'll find that it has been manually approved and the funds added to your account with an hour or two.

We appreciate your feedback.  What exchanges that are profitable accept credit cards and what methods do they use to prevent chargebacks?

It's Latin.  How do you pronounce QuadrigaCX?
We get this question a lot! QuadrigaCX is pronounced "Quaw-Dree-Gah See Ex." The CX stands for "Coin Exchange." For those wondering "What is a Quadriga?" - It is an ancient Roman chariot that symbolizes triumph and success -

It really all depends how soon someone is willing to sell at your "buy" price and how many coins are waiting to fill in orders before yours.  If the market value of Bitcoin drops then your order will likely fill, if it continues to rise in value your order may never fill.  If you want to acquire BTC ASAP then simply place a market order on the following tab:

But have you seen an increase from Grease and if so, what is it?
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:32:17
We remember you and glad it got sorted with you now being verified.  Our support is much better than any other exchange out there, we have been very responsive to all your emails therefore not really sure what part of our support "sucks".  In any case, welcome to the exchange.  You are going to spend significantly less in commissions compared to LocalBitcoins.

Thanks for all the feedback and positive reinforcement guys.  The majority of users pass verification with ease, however, at times if there's some red flags we have to take a deeper dive.
