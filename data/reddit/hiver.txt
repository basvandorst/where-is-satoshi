Maybe. Bch users largely don't consider paid transactions spam. However this is definitely inorganic.
So far tx fees have stayed low, it's not hard to pay 2sat/byte to get ahead of this - hell, my hardware wallet won't even let me pay under 10sat/byte most of the time. Rbtc is wringing their hands over it a bit, but I'll wait for it to start impacting me before I get too concerned.
Edit: mempool is currently at 140mb, if everyone were mining 8mb blocks (they're not) and the transactions stop (they won't) it'll be cleared in about 18 blocks. With the 2mb block miners we're probably looking at something closer to 25-30 blocks.

Hey Sara,
A lot of people are telling you how to access the money. That's the first step. Next you'll need to look into how to sell it as that is what you said you wanted to do.
Your husband probably had an account set up with an exchange. Popular ones include Coinbase.com/GDax.com, Bitfinex.com, Kraken.com, itBit.com, BitStamp.com, and Gemini.com. If he had a password manager set up visit those sites and see if there's a saved password for them. It'll save you a lot of time.
Most of those sites also offer 2 factor authentication. Check for Google Authenticator or Authy installed on his phone. It should have a list of sites he was set up on.
Once you figure out what exchange he was using, let us (or me) know and we'll walk you through sending them to the exchange and verifying the exchange is aware of your banking account.
It's probably also wise to look for any "hot wallets" he may have installed on his computer or phone or alt coins that may be stored on that device. Bitcoin is worth around $11,000, but Bitcoin Cash is worth about $1,800. You'll want to recover all of that if you're able.
Search his devices for "Bitcoin," "Etherium," "Electrum," "Litecoin," "Dash," "Ripple," "ZCash," "Monero" and "Neo." If he used reddit and you find his reddit username we can probably give you a decent idea of what currencies he was looking at, and maybe which exchanges he used.
Finally, like everyone else said, those words and numbers you found in the safe are essentially money. Don't let anyone have that information that you do not 100% trust - a sibling, parent, lawyer, someone like that. Don't trust any of us. We're all assholes and liars.
Edit: Beware the tax implications of selling. I live in the US and recently sold a substantial amount. I earmarked a third of that for taxes. I suggest you do the same.
Edit 2: Popular phone wallets I didn't call out specifically include Mycelium and Bread. Also, before you move any money check to see when the last transaction was in his bitcoin wallet. If it was before August 8th 2017 there's a little more work to do that will get you more money.

Um. How do you think they're going to "ensure lower amounts will be redeemable?" Remember, Microsoft goes through BitPay, and BitPay is adding bitcoin cash as soon as soon they implement a new addressing system -- which was released on several bitcoin cash clients yesterday. 
Edit: To be clear, Steam and Microsoft were two of the things I spent bitcoin on the most. Losing them sucked hard. I don't need BTC to lose for BCH to win. This isn't some kind of holy war for a lot of people.

Let's not have a scaling debate. Let's just read the white paper and reflect on the goal of the project and our progress. 
It's been nine years since the birth of our best chance against "too big to fail" banks. We've made a lot of progress, but have not established many closed loop ecosystems. 
The value of an individual coin is insane. This is beyond everyone's wildest predictions for when the entire world was using Bitcoin as a daily currency. I have a hard time understanding how we got here. I hope it's organic and sustainable.
The last couple of years have been a pretty big distraction. I think the price may have gotten out of hand a bit which could distract us further. But hopefully we can get back to the work of making Bitcoin a self reliant economy.

I wonder if this has something to do with the nature of these transactions. Someone seems to be dividing and recombining a large balance over and over, creating transactions with many inputs and a small number of outputs.

No, bch can clear the mempool a lot faster. The current BTC mempool would be cleared in about three hours on bch while it'll take BTC something like 20 hours. Both assuming no additional transactions.

If no one has euros, but you have bitcoins, won't they be more likely to accept your bitcoin?
To expand on my thoughts, if I were visiting Greece I may not want to hold euros on my person. A tourist with cash seems like a good mugging target. However, bitcoin is fungible to a degree, and its currently strong seemingly because Greece is weak. It might not be a bad idea to get in on it in exchange for a meal that no one has the cash to pay for, or a nights stay when few people are vacationing.

I tried Overstock again last Wednesday. I bought a belt. When all was said and done I think it ran about 10% over Amazon's price. It arrived yesterday, so it took longer to get too. Bleh.
I tried to pay for groceries with Gyft, but the web app experience is significantly less wieldy than the android app was. I ended up pulling a credit card because I did not have my gift card on screen when I got into line. I'll be better equipped next time, but I cannot get off gyft fast enough.

I do spend a lot with gyft today. The need for that is less pressing every week. Most of the content I consume (video games, podcasts, websites) are supported by bitcoin. Overstock has most of what my pantry needs, and they certainly have clothing. My home owner's association is talking about accepting bitcoin. You got me on my mortgage though. You failed to call me on my electric bill too.
So yeah, I could be a pedant and mock the very notion of bitcoin achieving anything, or I could look at which way the wind's blowing and realize I can buy just about whatever I want with bitcoin, even if there's a hoop or two to jump through.

Many people here aren't interested in getting rich quick; instead they want to build something new. I'm here because I think bitcoin empowers people - more so than State created currency. I pitch in when and where I can to help others empower themselves. 
There's a random oddball who's excited about Greece's financial troubles, but most of us aren't celebrating. There might be some schadenfreude, but mostly we're looking at a State doing something to it's people that we are not okay with.

That is an interesting question. The answer is "it depends."
First you need to understand that security isn't binary, you're not either secure or insecure. Would forwarding a port decrease your overall security? Yes, in a sense because you are allowing traffic into your network. If you were fully stealthed before (probably not) you are now revealing you exist. You are relying on your router to make sure the traffic goes to the right place, and your computers stack up to the bitcoin core wallet to handle all requests properly.
That said, at this time there is no exploit I can think of that would be a cause for concern. If you are only opening this one port, you are probably fine.

Most of my side jobs pay in bitcoin. I spend bitcoin at the club my girlfriend manages, which she uses to restock the bar at a local liquor store that accepts bitcoin. She could easily take a portion of her pay from that pool also (not sure if she does). I believe the liquor store owner keeps the bitcoin he gets. We've got a nice little closed loop going.

I ended up getting a windows phone this week, so I loaded my Microsoft Account with bitcoin.

Readit is the example that jumps to mind. 
There is no wallet software on WP. I'm working my way up to building one myself. Gyft is through the web interface only. That may dampen my usage of their service.

Mining verifies transactions and includes them in the blockchain. Nodes rebroadcast transactions and blocks and (I think) do some filtering so that they only rebroadcast what they perceive as valid.

Your post kind of implies the Bitcoin Foundation provides the Core client. This isn't true. The foundation is a group of businesses who support the open source project their businesses are built around. Every developer they have paid worked on the client before the foundation paid them.
Bitcoin existed before the foundation, and bitcoin will exist after it too. The foundation is not our friend. They are frequent allies, at best.
That said I've never done much to support core devs, other than tipping Gavin once years ago.

I rate a threat's risk with this formula: risk=probability*impact. 
Let's assign probability and impact a number between 1 and 10. Probability that this will happen to someone? 10, the tools are there, it doesn't appear very difficult to do, and at least one person will want to use it some day. 
Given the probability of someone doing this at some point is approaching certainty, the question for the merchant is how much of a loss can they afford to take frequently (say 1 in 10 times) before it hurts their business. What is the impact to my hypothetical coffee shop business if someone steals a cup of coffee? 1 - my margins absorb this hit comfortably.
This means the risk is a 10 on as scale of 1-100. I'm probably okay taking this risk if it helps my customers and/or marketing department.
If I were in a low margin or high-value business, like say a car dealership, the impact on someone stealing a car might be more like a 7.
This means the risk is a 70 out of 100. I probably do not want to take this risk. Thankfully I will have the customer captive for a bajillion hours while I work out delivery, pink slips, loans, and so on. Confirmations won't be an issue.

Speaking from a US perspective, most credit card transactions can be reversed within 90 days. A bitcoin transaction becomes less and less likely to be reversed every ten minutes. At an hour, it's probably not going to happen ever.
If you're buying a car, fridge, house, other large purchase, or online transaction odds are you'll be doing paperwork and working out delivery while the transaction suffers through the hour. If you're getting a cup of coffee or a cd, the merchant will display the same trust in you that they do for credit card transactions or checks.

So the fear is an entity flexed significant genius to make up a new currency that very likely could have gone no where on the off chance they'd be able to spread terror and destruction? 
It seems a little thin to me. Someone as smart as the person who came up with the Blockchain could probably come up with more certain ways to do evil. They could get into banking! (I kid.)
So if we rule out coming up with bitcoin for terrorism we're left with motives like greed (its against his interest to flash crash it, a slow, predictable sell would make more sense), power (if bitcoin does get big he would have some, but once the infrastructure is in place any cryptocurrency could take bitcoins place if push came to shove), and what... Love? I'm not sure how selling it would be more effective than flashing it around. It'd be a pretty special lady to get excited over private keys.

Chargepoint is a network of electric car charging stations. They use NFC in their stations to associate a session to your account, and it bills through a credit card that is associated with your account.
Now it'd be pretty easy for them to just let you "fill" your account in advance with bitcoin, like Namecheap's implementation.  But we can do better!
Give the car a wallet. Give the charger an address. When the charger connects to the car it makes a payment request via Chargepoint. When the car senses a trickle charge it polls chargepoint for pending requests at it's gps location. It then pays the request. 
As far as I'm aware all electric cars have cellular service, locking charging ports, and an onboard computer that could handle a wallet.
Advantages: 
1.  Easier for the end user - they only need to remember to reload their car's wallet periodically. 
2. The car could pay for a full charge at the station's rate, and then get refunded for what it didn't use.
3. Reduces credit card fees for ChargePoint, and since the average transaction is $2 or less, that may be significant for them.
1. Would require apps to be written for each car manufacturer. I'm not sure how well standardized that is.
2. Chargepoint would need to include bitcoin in their stations' firmware.
3. There is a risk of flight. You're not going to get much charge in 10 minutes, but an attacker might feel it's worth while to doublespend over and over to save $2.50.

I haven't used BitPay's api's api, but Blockchain's was pretty painless.

A way to use bitcoin for micropayments is to take it off chain. For this to work both payer and payee have to trust a third party. 
The third party controls a wallet and a database.  They generate a public address for payers to deposit into. When a payer wants to send money, the third party updates their database. 
When someone wants to withdraw money from the service the database is consulted to verify the amount is available, and then the transaction is published to the blockchain.
So in short, no, bitcoin by itself isn't viable for micro-transactions. Building that support on top of the protocol isn't very difficult to do.

ATMs are in the news a lot lately. I've been looking at getting an ATM operator business going with an eye to what I consider to be reasonable regulation, such as making it usable by wheelchair bound or blind people, and being able to keep tabs on how much business I do with a particular customer.
So far every single device has fallen short. Many of them want to charge a percentage per transaction in addition to the cost of the unit. I haven't seen one that has braille. I don't know how anyone is attempting to run a serious business on this half-assed hardware. If/when bitcoin ATMs get regulated like regular ATMs most of the existing devices will need to be completely replaced. 
What we have today are bitcoin vending machines. Calling them ATMs reveals a very naive understanding of the ATM industry.

Having a lobbyist organization doesn't strike me as a bad thing, but I'm afraid the foundation and the community will not always agree on what's best for bitcoin.
I'd like to see the foundation decentralized a bit. What if you were to have a public vote for each issue the foundation voted on? One where each ballot had to be signed with an address that held a reasonable quantity at a given block. What if you gave the outcome of that vote the authority of a few board members?
Right now the community feels wary of the foundation. I don't want my customers to think of me as a part of "they," or "them" if you follow me. If you can put in measures that get the community on your side again I'd be way less hesitant to sign up.

Think about what you said. A distributed bank. 
You ever travel? When I do, I have to pay $3-$5 to access money from an ATM if my bank doesn't have a presence where I'm at. Heaven help me if I'm someplace that uses a different currency. The long game for bitcoin solves this problem. We're still bootstrapping.
You ever use your bank's bill payment service? Have you ever forgotten about a bill until the day it's due? My bank takes 3 days. They can do same day, but it costs $12.95 to do. Bitcoin could have it there, confirmed, and ready to spend again in an hour. We're still bootstrapping.
Have any family out of your country/region? Have you ever met a migrant worker? International wire fees are pretty expensive. $35+ is pretty common. It also takes three business days or more for it to go through. Bitcoin is fast and it's cheap. We're still bootstrapping.

Nothing negative has happened as far as I can tell. There's some concerns over regulation, and a lot of people are worried because they might not be able to say "No one has held bitcoin for over a year and lost money." in a few weeks. After January the market was set to bearish and it refused to switch. There's a lot of points on the last year's graph that would make you think the market had changed it's attitude, but time and time again it hasn't.

It would require those accepting 0 confirmation transactions and the vast majority of pools to agree on the same rules, and everyone to be aware of what those rules are. I cannot get confirmation that the mining pool I'm on is using 9.x rules, I'm not sure how I'd get confirmation from all the pools. 
Then, what do we do when GHash.IO (29% of the blocks found in the last 24 hours) decides to blacklist all Satoshi Dice transactions?  Then the merchant needs to be aware of Ghash.IO's specific rules or risk double spend if the customer uses multiple outputs. Then maybe BTC Guild blacklists coinbase addresses for some reason (12%), and now we're at an easy 41% of the network's hashing power not caring about your transaction.
"Why not force pools to agree?" Because there is no central authority to do the forcing.
"What can we do?" Green addresses and/or off-chain transactions. Say I'm a WebWallet user and they're holding my bitcoin. I want to shop at Bitcoin Starbucks. Instead of sending the bitcoin directly from the wallet, I ask WebWallet to send Bitcoin Starbucks my payment with a green address. WebWallet takes the money from my wallet and puts it in theirs (they have my private key, if they aren't just storing my balance in a database entry) and they send payment from another input using an address that they have registered with Bitcoin Starbucks. Bitcoin Starbucks trusts this address based on reputation or a deposit held in escrow.

I apologize if I came off as an internet smart ass. I was attempting to illustrate a couple of points. 1) payment processors cost more than $50 set up fee and $50/month. 2) I needed to know nothing about you to **instantly** send you money. You cannot send me money via paypal yet because you don't know my email address.
Consider: I run a blog in Ebolinia and I write about things Ebolinia doesn't want me to write about. If I have to publish something like an email address to allow people to donate me I have two problems. First, as Wikileaks proved, payment processors can just blacklist me ~~for no reason~~ because a government suggests it might be helpful to them. Second, that email is a weak spot, to say nothing of the payment processor, that the tyrannical government of Ebolinia can use to monitor my actions and compromise my identity.
Where as with bitcoin I can generate a new public address every time my page is viewed, and send that money wherever I'd like after that. Can I eventually be caught through blockchain and metadata analysis? Yes, but it is a lot more difficult to do.
Finally, to address your edit on the previous post: Bitcoin's advantages to me are skewed by my perspective. I imagine you could find ways in which it's useful to you if you cared to. If not, I don't think anyone's twisting your arm to use it. We are an opt-in economy, after all.

Two spaces after a period was the standard in the typewriter era. The point of it was to avoid spacing issues on typed pages.

No. The federal government only has the authority to control what the constitution says it can. They can govern commerce between states. The states govern commerce within their boarders if they choose to exercise their power.

No, a wallet is all you really need. You can get more advanced; I think coinbase has merchant tools that'll let you generate an address on demand and so on. I haven't used it, but if you sign in and click the 'Merchant' tab on the left (not the top) it'll help you set it up.

The donation address listed on the page is held in escrow by @_date: 2014-09-15 18:13:32
Most of that list is aftermath from the Cold War, where we made deals to sit in allied countries, prepared to defend them against invasion. When the choice was between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S., the leaders of those nations made a decision. It sucks that they had to, but at least no one got sent to Gulag, eh comrade? 
I wonder how many people from the UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan, Croatia, The Netherlands, Belgum, etc want the US to leave. I bet it's not the majority.
I imagine if you took cold war hot spots off the list we'd be in fewer than 20 nations. I'll also bet most of those are war zones for reasons that were not created by the US. With the exception of a pair of Muslim States, I imagine our presence was requested. Now, if you want to say the war in Iraq was a mess and ISIS is largely our fault, yeah... I'm in.

Holy shit [this]( Sean's Outpost thread is gross. Edit: To elaborate, a year ago this sub was more charitable than most. Sean's Outpost was able to buy a plot of land off the donations. I was able to raise ~$150 for children's hospitals, and everyone I encountered was happy to do it.
These days wants to see tax documents from the charity and a receipt for their donation. There's nothing wrong with that *per se,* but the approach and tone of the threads seems overly hostile. The funds withholding is also a bit gross. Listen, you can drive to Pensacola and see Satoshi Forest. People have done it. Pictures have been posted. Seans Outpost is legit.
I had Sean's Outpost act as escrow for my fundraising drive this year. didn't throw in a single Satoshi, and my posts advertising it were ignored or downvoted. When I convert the bitcoins I did recieve to USD for the charity I will pay twice the market value for the coins. I will then donate half of the bitcoins to Take that, cynics.

Gyft has confirmed they're getting money from Google Wallet in the past. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:03:10
A bitcoin transaction that includes any sort of fee will usually be considered fully confirmed within an hour. That extra speed may/may not matter, depending on your use case.
You proposed two new questions in this edit.
1) This depends greatly on regulation. Personally, I don't plan to use ATMs if the transaction fees are more expensive than competition like Coinbase.
2) Depends on the regulations. If the industry is permitted to form it's own regulatory body? I imagine the impact on costs will be minor. Government regulations could be light-handed or heavy-handed.
Sorry I don't have more answers for you. Personally, I'm working to get paid in bitcoins for the majority of my income. My day job has asked our payroll service to look into the API Bitpay published a few weeks ago. If that happens I won't have to worry about "buying in," or if there is a fee associated with it I imagine it'll be negligible/picked up in the exchange rate drift. Most of my spending is done at places Gyft supports, so I never really have to "cash out." 
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:21:24

2 transactions per second is where the network is right now (I haven't checked, trusting you on that). The volume of transactions could rise or fall. If there is a ten fold increase of transactions today, the hashrate would stay the same. Since the transaction rate and the hashrate operate independently (but are not completely unrelated), I am interrupting your question as follows. "Are all these bits of metals, heavy metals, rare earth elements, and the energy to power them going to waste?"
Well, that depends on where your goals are. The people who are using the farms certainly see it as a net positive. The people who think bitcoin is the future of money and want to keep it safe from attack while it develops don't think its a waste. I imagine people who'd like to attack cryptocurrencies think it's wasteful.
I personally think the truth can line up with the environmentally conscious humanist perspective. Having a currency free of control is important enough to spend energy on. However, we should attempt to minimize our impact on the environment. We should continue to push for renewable energy generation, especially in nations going through industrial revolutions.

I hope you keep your ear to the ground for any concerns raised about Coinbase and have a backup plan prepared. 
It sounds like the community could do a better job of providing the end user a way to securely control their bitcoins. I hope the upcoming hardware wallets (Trezor and maybe BFL's?) help in that regard. Maybe I'll start playing with my arduino kit to see if there's an answer I can cook up.

Thanks for following up. My example was clearly not what you're talking about. 
I'm a bit fuzzy about what's actually happening still. Per [Investopedia]( a public vehicle is anything someone can invest in. Bitcoin is already that, isn't it? Nothing's preventing anyone on the planet from buying some portion of bitcoin. If Atlantic Financial, Morgan Stanley et al want to offer them, why don't they just buy them as their customers invest? 
edit: I saw your concerns with divulging strategies, which seems reasonable to me. I'd be happy to talk to you in private if it would aid communication. If you're talking big money, I would recommend going co-op. There are a lot of smaller holders who would be willing to invest a portion of their holding. I'm not sure how many of the big guys would be up for something like this.

Thanks for pointing out the advantage of this over simply leaving the pool. You're right.
**edit:** everything I said below this edit is wrong. Killerstorm was kind enough to steer me to a correct answer with humility and grace. **/edit**
Your post didn't really clarify how the attack could be performed for me, and neither did rereading the OP. Since I was holding the null hypothesis, I didn't feel I had to prove anything, but I decided to read over the Stratum source code anyway. 
[This]( is the class that verifies the share submitted is valid. The following is my understanding, but I may be wrong as python is not my native language and I am not overly bright. Please correct me, I'm not trying to argue or start a fight. I just want to understand what's happening.
It looks like the share that gets submitted is the merkle tree hashes of the transactions the pool has associated with the job the miner has been assigned. The pool checks to make sure it doesn't already have the current set of parameters tucked away from a previous submission. Then the pool hashes in the merlke tree of the new transaction (the block reward), then hashes the entire block header to see if it has a valid block. If the new candidate appears valid, it submits the block to the network.
So, if I'm reading this right, the miner itself never has the "complete block" to work with. It does the majority of the hashing that is required before last two steps, which reduces the number of hashes the pool has to perform from (large number here) to two per attempt at generating a block. 
edit: The take away of this is the pool can simply generate a new address for each block it submits and defeat this attack.

You can’t hide secrets from the future with math. 
You can try, but I bet that in the future they laugh 
at the half-assed schemes and algorithms amassed 
to enforce cryptographs in the past. 
It's weird that a man called [MC Frontalot]( spits the truth. If your encrypted wallet is out of your control, you're racing against a clock. Sure, the clock might be ticking down from the lifetime of the universe, but it might be shorter. Even if you're using a good password, if you believe a wallet has left your control (or the control of those you trust, say Dropbox), it's not a bad idea to move your coins.
I've seen people float the idea of a "honey pot" wallet, one that has a weak(er) passphrase. If the coins in that wallet are moved you know to move the other wallet. I'm not saying you should do that, but I'm not saying not to do it either.

I'm sorry, I missed where you mentioned percentage. 
Then we have a question of economics. You can buy a few thousand satoshi for one doge. A few dollars can buy you a thousand doge or several hundred thousand satoshi. If bitcoin goes up 10%, your net worth goes up 10%. If dogecoin goes up 10%, your net worth goes up 10%.
That leaves the question: which is more likely to go up 10%? The one that is getting wall street backing, or the one that has what amounts to a cartoon mascot?
Sure, it can be both, but I personally don't believe doge has enough unique going for it to take off in the way bitcoin and litecoin have. You talk about helping the lower classes, and that's a noble ambition. There is plenty of room to help bitcoin achieve that goal without splintering the community with redundant altcoins.

Also consider bitcoin sales make a fraction of a percent of their total sales. I suspect the same could be said for most individual countries in Europe. Figuring out how bitcoin is taxed in each country for a fraction of a fraction of a percent in sales isn't going to be worth it.

[This]( is the warning from Apple. I realize there have been mercifully few exploits in the wild and that Apple is likely spreading FUD about it for business reasons.
It boils down to risk. Having a web wallet: not the best idea. Having it on your phone: an even worse idea. Having it on your phone with out any app screening: worse yet.
That said, I keep some pocket money on my web wallet that is tied to an android device. I manage how much I keep there and what applications I install carefully. I explicitly deny apps from untrusted sources. I know I'm being an idiot and that my money has a significant risk of getting stolen. 
I haven't rooted my android because I don't have a need for anything that a rooted device offers, and if something were to go wrong with the Android security model (a privilege escalation or something) that results in me losing money, I'd like to still be covered by warranty so that I could *theoretically* sue someone.

It takes all of two minutes to set up an account on a different pool and point your miner's to it. I'm not sure what this "attack" accomplishes that switching pools would not.
If this attack were possible (I'm pretty sure pools operate on a trustless system, but I haven't looked at it that closely), we would expect to see additional checks added by the pools to verify the miner is using valid software and/or returning the expected number of hashes given the blob they were provided.

Stackoverflow isn't broken. Similar services exist that provide monetary reward. They are flooded with poor quality answers - these are posters who are playing the averages. The posts are poorly written, and it often contains copy/pasted code that only vaguely applies to the scenario at hand. These posts are rewarded because they are fast.
Best case scenario: Jon Skeet makes a few hundred thousand dollars a year from his fan base. The average poster gets a dollar or two a year, loses motivation and stops posting.
Probable scenario: Mediocre or worse posts flood the system. The wheat to chaff ratio falls off a cliff. The site becomes unusable. 
I'm not saying there isn't some capitalistic solution out there. I am saying StackOverflow is not the place to run that experiment.

You are correct. 
I spend btc because that is where I store any dollar I make that doesn't have a job. I've also reduced my entertainment budget and moved the surplus to bitcoin. If I want to do something off budget, I have to find a way to do it in btc.
We aren't seeing the 5% incentive because currently the demand to do business in bitcoin comes from the consumer side. Once small businesses feel the advantages they will probably start to encourage btc transactions with discounts.

I understand difficulty and how it relates to a valid block hash. I believe, from the reading I've done on the linked source code, that the work **pooled** miners submit is the hashing work done before the hash for the entire block is produced.
To reiterate, the pool issues the desired transactions to the pooled miners hash (hashMerkleRoot on the wiki). The miners submit the Merkle tree hashes to the pool. The pool then adds the final transaction (the block reward) to the hashMerkleRoot and then it completes the header and generates a hash for the new block. You can see this happening on line 202 of the linked file.
If I am wrong, can you please clarify where and how? Saying "No. read wiki." doesn't really clear anything up.

It would be nice if the community rules listed on the sidebar were enforced by something other than the upvote/downvote system. We don't need to be draconian about it, but at the very least a mod should pop up and say "This does not belong here." I nearly unsubscribed today after over a year of watching this sub, in part do to the altcoin bickering.
This sub (not the bitcoin community in general) has become toxic. Dogecoin posts are a reaction to that. I don't think it's a particularly helpful approach, but they're trying to do something. I think if we take some time to approach the problems we're having as a sub we'll see less  negative "invasions" from outside.
How do we do that? I don't have a solution, but I have suggestions. 
Grant certain people some sort of "booster" flair. This flair would identify people who are known to engage in productive conversation. An "expert" flair could be applied to people who have demonstrated an above average knowledge of the bitcoin protocol. 
We could also bring back "Moronic Mondays" (maybe rebrand it some...) with a link to Automod could make this post if the actual mods don't feel like it.
Adding a community wiki might also be of service. Frequent topics ("Let's get Steam/Blizzard/Amazon to accept bitcoin," "Why do people say I shouldn't mine?," etc) could be covered in a more dynamic and detailed means than the FAQ does currently. It also would provide an easy link for people to provide when the thread is raised again. People who say "Stop asking this!" without providing a link could be downvoted for not providing any effort to assist the person.
A stickied "thread of the week" that highlights a conversation that didn't quite make it to the front page but had good discussion would also be welcome. Let's go out of our way to highlight the good things that happen on this sub. 
We're a laissez faire sub, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have leadership. Please mods, be proactive!

Helping the community doesn't keep anyone fed. At the current rate 10btc is about a month's salary for a programmer in the US. I'm not sure that this is a 30-man-day project, especially since the requirements are a little loose. As such people are going  to want to verify the money exists before diving deep into it.

This is what the bitcoin foundation is good at. They pay for Gavin and (I think) Waldimir's salary.

To be honest 99% of the time it's me sending from one client to another, and I'm not doing anything that Bitpay/Coinbase isn't able to track anyway. When I'm dealing with other people I'm more likely to present a QR code as that seems to be what people are most readily equipped to deal with atm.

It's more of a "Will it happen to me? If so, how bad will it suck?" Since we know it will happen, how bad it sucks is going to be based on how frequently it happen. I'm estimating 1 in 10, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that number much lower, and based on local culture for brick and mortar.

Gyft and every other gift card distributer actually pay less than face value for cards. I don't know that bulk has anything to do with it. The merchant that redeems the gift card gets a guaranteed sale, which is apparently worth something like 5% to them. Maybe it's because there are no chargebacks on payments made with gift cards.

Hmm. I tipped  $10 for Sword and Laser last week which she did not accept, but did respond. She could have had other reasons... at the time I thought it was because she didn't like bitcoin.

"Alice gives Bob an IOU for $1.
Bob gives Carol a copy of the IOU from Alice.
Bob realizes he doesn't want Carol to have the IOU. He makes another copy and gives it to Dave. Dave promises to give Bob back $.95 if he can get the $1 from Alice before Carol does.
Alice lives all the way across town and Dave is trying to get to her on foot. Carol has a jet pack. What do you think Dave's chances are?"
The IOU bit isn't really appropriate, but since the whole thing is a metaphor anyway I think you'll get the idea.

I'd guess it's getting downvoted for not being relevant to the current discussion. No one's debating bitcoin is the primary currency on TOR. We're saying illicit trading is not bitcoin's primary function, and the wikipedia article should reflect that. Saying the USD is used for WMDs, CP, Drugs, Slavery, and Terrorism isn't relevant to the USD article, right?
The child porn, drug, and terrorism issues have been brought up several times in this sub. If you'd like more info, the search box is on the top. Bitcointalk goes into it even deeper. You can probably imagine why the bitcoin booster club doesn't want to dwell on these issues, but to say they're ignored is disingenuous.

Let's say I'm a large holder (I'm not as big as what you're asking for), and my only experience with finance is bitcoin, a college macroeconomics class, and my checking/savings/401k (which is true for a lot of bitcoiners).
How does this work? This is my guess: I post my stake as X bitcoins. People pay N dollars for a percentage of the profit X bitcoins make. While I retain ownership of my bitcoins I'm obligated to provide dividends. Is that about right?
Also, a lot of people who are four digits deep in bitcoin are more paranoid than you can imagine. PCI compliance doesn't even begin to touch what many bitcoiners consider reasonably secure, especially when talking about a significant holding. Everyone here is responsible for the safety and security of their own wealth. As a result, expect a lot of plausible deniability, skepticism, and probing for information before you see anything back.  
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:53:52

I'm a bit confused on a couple of points. 
First, neither picture ties this post to the person in the picture. I don't own anyone could register that and grab some pictures off my facebook feed. So come back with a sign that says "Hi reddit, I'm and I want your bitcoins." If you're going to prove your identity, you may as well do it.
Second, the address you mentioned has not received anywhere near 10 bitcoins. In fact it's only had .125 bitcoin run through it, and it appears to have received it's first donation rather recently. Where are the other ~9.875btc? 
I'm not saying you're a scammer or anything, but these two inconsistencies make me a little hesitant to irreversibly send money to a site I've never seen for a project I've never heard of. I didn't even know MIT had anything to do with medical research until moments ago.

You and I are debating different points. If a merchant gets a scammy chargeback one time out of a hundred that is bad. Probably within their margin of risk, but it's still bad.
My point is it's not as trivial as Bitundo criers make it seem. I agreed to your conditions because I didn't exclude it in my post and I think it'd be interesting to see it happen.

I fully agree with you. If Jason's running a scam it'd be a very impressive one that has been going for years. It's one that has had legal questions addressed by the law. It is entirely possible that he might be getting paid more than he should, but it seems extremely unlikely that people are not being helped by Sean's Outpost. On that basis, calling him a scammer is premature at best.

Out of curiosity, why don't you get an address from and have people donate directly? If you get a new address, you can track donations just as easily there, and it removes a layer of trust from the donation.

Word. The article says it was for their gold items, and when I looked at those items there was no mention of bitcoin. The year old article said they were doing a test in January. I will assume that bitcoiners did not jump at the chance to buy a gold plated vibrator.

So Doge's charity gets brought up a lot as a differentiator of our communities. Did you know we've purchased a plot of land for the homeless?

It won't work with any regularity because they need to find miners who are interested in enabling the attack. They currently have something to the order of 0% of the network, meaning they have approaching 0% chance of being the miners who find a block enabling them to invalidate a transaction.

This sub. Hodl is choosing to ignore the discussion we had on his points. 0 confirmation attack? Wait for at least one confirmation. Blockchain bloat? Pruning algorithms are in the works, and a spot for that is baked into the protocol iirc. Shrinking full nodes? I haven't looked into this one personally, so I can't speak to it.

Did you know banks lose money fairly frequently? They rarely report losses to the FDIC as the loss will become public knowledge and people will lose confidence in a bank that can't secure money. The free market has actually already solved this problem for most cases. So we're actually paying for the illusion of safety in any but the most egregious crimes.

So the top comment was mocking an archtype and not that post's specific story? Because the only details I got from the story were 1) Op sees they're using a tablet to accept payments. 2) Op asks if they accept bitcoin. 3) They said no in a rude fashion. 
Duder didn't ask for a letter writing campaign. They were asking for solidarity - confirmation that they weren't alone in getting shut down completely when asking about bitcoin acceptance. There may be some attempt to regain acceptance in the face of rejection.
There might be room for discussion on people basing their identity on the currency they use, but you appear to be manufacturing a narrative based on preconceived notions unrelated to that op and their story.

Yes, you're talking about miners, which are not the same thing as full nodes. 
Full nodes take blocks they are presented, confirm they are valid, and add them to their copy of the blockchain. The "confirm they are valid" step is missing from your picture, which is why we want as many full nodes as possible running legitimate clients.

Credit cards typically do not pay merchants instantly. IIRC there's a 30 day wait for payment and then chargebacks can be lifted from a merchant's balance for 60 days beyond that. I'd rather take the risk on a 0 confirmation payment that would be expensive to take away from me than wait for the money from Visa. 
I'm assuming a transaction on the scale of a cop of coffee and some doughnuts.

Say two blocks are found at the same time. Each full node gets one block, then finds out about the other a few moments later. The nodes will accept the first block they hear about. This creates two separate but valid versions of the blockchain. The first version of the blockchain to get an additional block will win. 
So if someone releases a bitcoin client that exploits some sort of flaw, in order for the blockchain that it produces to become *the* blockchain, it has to have a statistically significant percentage of nodes. The more "honest" nodes there are, the harder it is to produce that percentage.

This week I was in San Francisco for one of Microsoft's developer conferences. I finally made the pilgrimage to one of the first physical locations I know of to accept bitcoins, [Cups and Cakes]( The lady working the counter was awesome. She said she's been working there less than a year, but she's only seen a handful of bitcoin transactions. The cup cakes were delicious, I would recommend you head over there.
It was surprisingly chilly, so I needed a hoodie. Being an idiot I stopped into a fashion label store and spent entirely too much on one. My bank declined my debit card transaction even though I had the money and I notified them I was traveling. While the guy was running a different card I asked him about bitcoin. They didn't accept it, but he said he had read positive things about it lately. A similar sentiment was expressed by an Uber driver the next day. 
I bought a video game from a company I've mentioned in the past. They are starting a new campaign to market to twitch, YouTube and twitter folks. I joined as an affiliate. The affiliate link platform they're using is [Tapfiliate]( They pay out in bitcoin. I don't know how the game store and Tapfiliate settle accounts, but from my perspective its a closed loop.
Edit: Forgot, I bought Hitman Go and the Dragon Age anime from the Windows store with bitcoin using that convoluted process. Here's hoping they make it easier soon.

You get to decide the risk you're comfortable with. 6 confirmations is the gold standard. One confirmation is the equivalent of the cashier running an iodine marker over a bill or holding it to the light to see the strip to confirm it's valid. It's not 100%, but it'll weed out passive theft.

I grew up poor. I know many people who cannot have bank accounts. When I got a job and my own place, the banks screwed me at every opportunity. One of the banks was taken to court years later, and the class action settlement got me 1/100th what it cost me directly. It didn't cover the experience of going two weeks without groceries. 
When I started coming into my own financially, banks did a bang-up job wrecking the economy (by screwing people). Then my tax dollars had to save their company, while they put my friends back home on the street (or into shitty rentals). So... *fuck banks*. 
I also think the technology is neat. I'd probably have some to fiddle with even if banks were not an issue.

Allow me to be more direct for you then:
Stop treating groups as one entity instead of a collection of individuals. There is a lot of divergence in our community, we just don't spend time bickering with ourselves to make it evident to plebeians.
For example, there are a lot of people here who are excited for Wall Street to enter the space. These people aren't overly upset about ties to Goldman Sachs, in fact they're quite the opposite. I imagine there are some people who would rather see Bitcoin remain completely separate from the existing financial system. These are the the people I think you were trying to provoke? 
Personally speaking, I don't really care about resumes. I'm more interested in ideas. I upvoted Scotty because he was contributing relevant information to the discussion, and downvoted you for being a trollish idiot.

I tried the only pizza place in town that accepts bitcoin. I wasn't thrilled with the food, and it is a bit out of the way for us. Sad times.
I had a bit of vacation time from work last week, so I found myself at AMC (via gyft) a lot. 
I also picked up a strategy guide for Witcher 3 at GameStop via gyft. If you're playing that game and wish you had a better map, the digital version is worth it.
Finally I was not able to find a Windows vps for bitcoin. Of the few options that are out there, most had very poor reviews. I don't know if bitcoiners as a group are too cynical and demanding, or if the services out there are hoping to scam people. I ended up creating a new account on Azure. If you have suggestions for those who follow me please share.

Hmm. If it hops on every block that might be okay, right? The 51% requires more than one confirmation, so if Ghash (for example) sees the metapool coming they can't really capitalize on it.
The downside I see is pool's like Slush's penalize you for coming in to a round late (I think... I should double check that), so miners could take a hit if pools like that were included.
I'm looking around for documentation on writing a plugin still. Haven't found anything yet.

I'm not married to BU, but I do want to buy coffee (and video games, movie tickets, my mortgage payment, electric bill, etc) with Bitcoin. A few years ago I was able to do most of what I wanted to using the currency I preferred.
I don't understand how segwit helps me as someone who's not a financial service provider, but whatever. I don't want to pay $.40-$2 to spend my money. If segwit can fix that, and it restores functionality to the 2014 standard: gogogo.
There is a vocal minority in rbtc who oppose segwit. Many of us just want Bitcoin to be useful again. The bulk of us want to hear informed debate. Unfortunately the way that community was formed lead to a very one-sided conversation.
At the end of the day we're all still bitcoiners. I fear a lot of people in both communities have forgotten that. In fact there is a narrative that someone is pushing saying there is one true way forward for Bitcoin and anyone with a different idea is some alt-coin shill. That seems very us-and-them, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:57:25
If you feel the bu client produces invalid blocks after its activated, then you should broadcast a transaction moving coins to a bu-aware exchange and sell. Such an exchange will probably support both forks for a period, unless the people who run it are as emotionally invested as the community seems to be. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:40:15
If BU forks they will announce it ahead of time. There will be a date set. My guess is they'll schedule it around the time of a difficulty adjustment. 
What the price will do? Well, that's an interesting question. I think overall it'll increase as transaction fees lower, making it more useful to people. If SegWit comes online after the fork, I think it'll increase again. But a lot of bitcoiners feel that BU is a hostile take over, and they'd be likely to sell. 
I expect there to be a dip leading up to the hardfork as the Core side of the community shouts the sky is falling. That's when I plan to buy. Assuming I'm right and bitcoin honey badgers on, the price should recover in a (relatively) short period of time.

Off the top of my head, a few Caribbean nations that are not owned by the US use USD. Which country controls the Euro?
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:39:45
Yeah they do. I haven't been able to stomach hanging around either sub much for the last year and change. 
As far as the plans... 
I don't know enough about Core to talk about it knowledgeably. I'm taking a gamble on the Core team and people watching it being intellectually honest and acting in good faith. These are the drawbacks that I've heard about that *seem* accurate.
* Bitcoin becomes a settlement layer for off chain transactions - transacting on chain will likely be too expensive for normal people.
* I don't think Lightning Network is done yet, which means the current fee problem may not be addressed immediately or as thoroughly as a block size scaling solution.
* It seems complicated. I have a sophomoric technical understanding of bitcoin (as in I can craft and sign my own transactions, and broadcast them through an existing client); but it's hard for me to wrap my head around the nuance of SegWit. That might just be because it's new and propaganda from both sides of the community have obscured it a bit.
I've kept tabs on the bigger block folks a little closer than the Core community. I don't know a lot of details about any of the proposed plans on this side of the community.
* Bigger blocks in general would increase the bandwidth and storage requirements for running a full node and mining. As far as I know a raspberry pi can act as a mining controller and a full node, even with bigger blocks. This one seems overstated.
* There have been troublesome bugs in the BU client. 
* I don't think Bitcoin Unlimited has had as many developers working on it as Core. In general, fewer people looking at open source projects is bad.
* By all accounts Core's solution is stable and well crafted. 
* It seems to have support from several big players. 
* It is ambitious, and could pay off big for several industries and make bitcoin more attractive to the mainstream. 
* This is a gateway to the layer 2 solutions we've been talking about for several years.
* It is a direct solution to a problem we're facing now.
* It will be helpful for small businesses and individual users without adding much complication.
* It is easier to implement compatible clients, allowing for more diversity down the road.
* Adding SegWit after solving block scaling seems more likely to happen than the reverse, since SegWit would likely unload those challenges off chain. If you've ever worked with the US Banking industry's "core network" (unfortunate name collision) you can understand how frustrating it is to be stuck with archaic limitations.

Just want to tag on to this... the transactions sent during the fork will likely be recorded on both chains, but at different times. For *most* use cases this probably won't matter a lot to you as an end user, and once the fork resolves you can carry on as normal.

My concern is that in the past, when bitcoin was doing well altcoins did well. When bitcoin first caught on, litecoin came out literally as a compliment to it ("silver to bitcoin's gold," was the tag line). If no one is trading any of the alts directly for fiat, it means there's a squeeze on their ecosystems. Since their ecosystem is generally contained within our ecosystem, I am concerned about the overall state of our ecosystem.
This is not to say "ZOMG bitcoin is dead!!1!" I'm just not sure this is a victory.

If that comes, assuming the fork is still decisive, I would expect miners on both chains to permit you to submit transactions to them directly. I'd go so far as to wager someone would set up a service to automate it. Send BU to one address, Core to another. Whippity boom, you're done. There'd be a window for a replay attack, so of course you'd want both addresses to be ones you control. None of this matters if a consensus is reached. Of course, as long as both camps are demonizing each other that won't happen. There's a failure in leadership all around on that front, in my estimation.

I don't know your financial situation, but this seems a bit risky. Also, your reasons don't make sense. 
You think you'll be more likely to spend bitcoin than a debit card? Not any time soon. 
The price changes in bitcoin work both ways. This may or may not be the lowest it goes for a while. You don't know for sure. You may end up losing a ton of money here.
As far as banks screwing you... it's true, they do. I've been paid on class action lawsuits several times because banks screwed up. However, you'll find it's less frequent when you have more money in the account.
You make $2,000 a month. Maybe spend $100 a month (5%) on bitcoin until you have at least $6,000 saved to handle losing your job. From there, increase it to $200 (10%) - which is still a HUGE portion of your income. You'll still be taking risks and sticking it to the man or whatever, but you'll still be in the realm of sanity.

Miners kind of are the network. If you don't like the client run by the miners, you can transact with miner that run the client you do like. If all the hash power suddenly goes to Hivercoin, then Hivercoin is suddenly a super secure network. Maybe you don't like Hivercoin. That's fine, use bitcoin and transact on the bitcoin network. Also, start mining bitcoin again because there's an actual chance to turn a profit on it; assuming enough other users feel like you.
Miners want bitcoins to be worth more, just like hodlers. The more it's worth, the more they earn. If they do something harmful to the network, they would expect the price to drop when hodlers will sell as they lose confidence. If you think larger blocks are going to actually hurt the price/usability of bitcoin, then you should sell. Miners will be left holding the bag on expensive equipment and you'll be able to invest in whatever digital currency you think does it better; the bitcoin-core altcoin, maybe.
I'm not sure I get your last argument. It's not like one miner can say, "I produce 1gb blocks!" and expect the rest of the network to accept it. The other miners/full nodes have a say on whether or not a block is valid. If you send your bitcoin and it gets mined by the 1gb-block producing miner, only clients that recognize 1gb-blocks will say that transaction is confirmed. If the person you're sending it to someone who doesn't recognize 1gb blocks, they're going to say it's unconfirmed and will wait for it to appear in a &lt;reasonable block size&gt; block.

Thought experiment: If we assign various influences of bitcoin a value that indicates their potential to move the price, it would be easy to see how one influence can overpower another.
Let's assign full blocks an arbitrary -.25  delta potential. Let's assign halving an arbitrary 2 delta potential.
-.25 + 2=1.75. 
Clearly the delta is still going in a positive direction. I think each debatable piece of bitcoin has a delta potential number. The rub would be assigning accurate values to them.
Put another way: block size isn't as important as halving.

It might be because that's a common question and he assumed people with legitimate interest in the subject would have looked in to it already. 
Here's a quote from an interview [Bitcoin Magazine]( did with ABC developer Amaury Sechet that I think provides the best current answer to your question.

This sub was calling a modest blocksize increase a shitcoin alt for no good losers. The base of core users, if is any indication, do not want a blocksize increase. Since BCH is the only game left in town that is offering one, all the users who want immediate relief seem to be jumping ship.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:07:00
That is certainly a perspective. Since the fork is over and both chains have different strengths do you think it might be time for leadership to tone down the vitriol a bit? It doesn't look like either fork is going away and this infighting has to stop sometime. Remember when banks and PayPal were the competition?

Similar things have been happening in over the last day or two. 
I wonder who would like to see crypto users at eachother's throats.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:09:42
That's encouraging to hear. Here's a few suggestions. 
Bch users largely consider their coin to be bitcoin. Calling it an alt is a way to provoke them. A new term might be needed to distinguish coins like ltc, eth, and bch from the ripples and dogecoins of the world. There has to be a happy medium between Bitcoin and "shitcoin alts."
Calling it a pump and dump/scam/etc is another way to provoke a response. Maybe Ver has a diabolical scheme in place. Maybe he needed a 20%-30% boost to his usd holdings. However, there are enough people on that chain now that it'd probably continue after his exit. 
I imagine even if you and the rest of the mod staff took these suggestions to heart, and the rest of the core team wouldn't be convinced. I'm afraid you're seen as a single unit. Finding a way to establish you are in fact an independent group would probably get a lot of ideological fighting off your plate. That doesn't mean you have to oppose Core's vision. I'm not sure how you do it, to be honest. This sub has been seen as "core or bust" for most of the scaling debate. It might take a new client implementation to give you an opportunity to change that perception.
I'm afraid the remains of are alive and well in both communities. Everything said about one community by the other has their aggressive tone. Honestly, just dialing that down a bit would make everyone less defensive and hostile.
None of this will solve the problem  over  night. But if community leaders start setting an example of higher  discourse  I think  the community  will eventually follow. 
I don't have ear or anything, and there's not really a mod team to speak of, but I'd be happy to bring your concerns with me back to FWIW I view this as Ubuntu and SuSE users arguing about which distro is truly Linux. It's very silly from that perspective. (In before a flood of links "demonstrating" bch leadership are bad actors.)

That's a valid perspective. Four months ago it was talking about btc. Since the way that community developed gave it an anit-segwit bent the hard fork caused them to side with the bch chain. They do still talk about btc some, there's even a few $10k+ posts over there right now.

The easiest way to send someone bitcoin is with changetip, in most cases. If your recipient is a little savvy and would like USD/Euro/GBP out a service like Coinbase.com (where available) is a good way to go. That service requires knowledge of the user's email address and they must be willing to provide bank details to "withdraw" it.
I'm not sure it's possible to explain _everything_ related to bitcoin to a 5 year old. There's a lot going on ranging from cryptography, to computer science, to decentralization, to economic theories. You'll need to be a little more precise.

Prior to the FDA there were thousands of snake oils and cure all's flooding the market that did absolutely nothing. People were dying while looking for a treatment that actually worked. 
It could be argued that it's less of a problem now that anyone can access information about a drug, but even so homeopathy, ranki, and medicinal acupuncture are still things despite having (nearly) no clinical support.
FDA policies may be due for some revisions, but the need for a regulatory body in the health field is hard to dispute.

Well, you can compare 1800 to 1906 if you'd like to see another ~100 years of progress up to the formation of the FDA. Since you're asking the question I'll let you do the research, but I think you're looking for a change in causes and an overall reduction of deaths. Since refrigeration and vaccination are fairly interdependent, I'd suggest focusing on bacterial causes of death.
Penicillin was discovered in 1928, which is probably the most life saving drug to date. Scottland had regulations for medicines in place at that time.
I predict having structure, quality control, and benchmarks for success help a lot.

Bitcoin has no borders or ideologies. PKR does. If you want to turn your bitcoins into PKR you have to play by PKR's rules. 
I feel your pain, it's the same thing with the USD for me. My ability to start the business I want to start is being hamstrung by currency controls that are completely irrelevant to my business. But I want to play with USD, and USD's rules apply.
As for your sub question, I like the Trezor. I think it'd be the best way to hold any significant amount of bitcoins shy of a multisig address with each address held on a different pc , which is technically complicated at the moment.

On gift cards, I like bitcoin, but not enough to radically change my shopping habits. Sure, Green Man Gaming is a good substitute for Steam, since my games still appear on Steam. Buying from Overstock is less convenient for me than Amazon, since I take advantage of several of Prime's benefits. I shop at Target, Starbucks, GameStop, and I go to AMC movies. Gyft is my way to keep my routine while spending my preferred currency.  
Given the option, I'll avoid using a credit card. Playstation, Target, and Home Depot have all caused me to call for new cards. All of them are on Gyft, via GameStop for Playstation.
Calling any sort of customer service center is annoying. I hate calling to request a new card. I hate calling to let my bank know I'll be out of town. My travel plans shouldn't be any of my bank's concern, but since their stupid pull mechanism is broken, I'm more likely to call them than a travel agent.

They used a third party framework that had a reputation for security. The framework is used by Apple, NSA, GitHub, and others. Here's the link to the [wiki]( The framework uses a library with a flaw that enables this sort of attack. So Authy moved from one standard of parameter passing to another to solve the problem.
The scenario that enables this attack in the wild is fairly rare. You need to be able to convince the server that the int it expects is actually a string. I suppose that's possible for some frameworks, but not frequently with enterprise tier applications. 
I think we can all agree that Authy should continue to audit their security practices as a part of their SDLC.
Edit: 2fa isn't mission critical. You use two factors in case one factor fails. Usually that comes from the something-you-know side, but this time it came from the something-you-have side. It's not good for either factor to fail, but redundancy is sort of the point.

I agree with many of your bullet points in principle, but I think concessions to practicality are not to be given up. Frameworks exist and are in use for good reason, see QT framework. REST/JSON are a standard, and implementing them securely is not terribly difficult for the majority of the web. These guys made a mistake in their implementation, and it was masked by their customer's parameter checking. (For example, making sure the tokens are ints and not strings before sending the request to Authy.)

But thanks to the redundancy built into the system already, this was never exploited.  Yay! One overlooked input validation did not cause the collapse of society because multiple checks were done at multiple levels everywhere this was implemented (UI, customer's server, and the failed check on authy's server). It's sucks that there was a point of failure, but in order for this exploit to actually work there'd need to be at least three points of failure.

I don't hate dogecoin so much as the people who try to push it as as a viable currency. Being worth less is not an advantage, its just ignorance. Being infinitely inflationary was a shortcoming in every digital currency before doge (dating back to the 90s) but because there's a cute dog attached its suddenly a good thing?

IMO that discount is the reward for learning about and using bitcoin. 
My monthly buys have a fee. If I used a service to take my paycheck as bitcoin I'd have a fee. That's the nature of it until we can close the loop. The loop doesn't get closed until merchants convince consumers that bitcoin is the way to pay, despite it's ecosystem's current drawbacks.

You could set up a reserve of bitcoins at your local municipal building. Then you print notes that can be redeemed for bitcoins at said municipal building.

From your post 6000 nodes, 1500 accepting incoming connections. Karpeles isn't really talking about his methodology there. BCI lists approximately 2700 unique IPs that it's connected with today, and over 3 million IPs over all time ( 
Where are you getting your numbers?
Edit: I think OP is referring to this:  which lists 6500 reachable nodes. If I understand everything correctly, that number is over four times bigger than the number from 5 years ago. Not stellar, but it's not as bad as OP is making it out to be.

The part where there's no such thing. Let's say we somehow make it so there is no way for any one person to get 51% of the hashing power. Now the attacker has to target and compromise individual miners.

Security professional here. Reposting the [same advice I gave]( last time this thread came up, with a few minor updates.
You will never know for sure that your system is free of backdoors unless you design, build, and code your own system, starting at the processor dye.
Do I think China ordered their factories to put a back door into routers? Yes. Do I think the US has compromised Windows to some degree? Yes. Have I, or anyone I know, spent the time to validate a Linux kernel? No. That means I'm trusting a stranger; might as well be a stranger I could theoretically sue. 
It boils down to risk. Are these global powers likely to invoke their god-like wrath to ruin your day? Probably not. If these backdoors exist, they are currently out of reach from the typical hacker.
Out of the box a modern Windows PC is riddled with holes. You know this, so you turn on windows update and put the machine behind a router and you install an av. You keep all of your software patched. At this point you're reasonably secure and the only person likely to change that is you and the third party software you install.
Linux and Mac PCs present a smaller surface area to hackers, and their low market share gives them a kind of reverse herd immunity. That said, I have never personally worked on a *nix/Mac box that has any sort of detection mechanism in place above the core OS, even though such software is available. I have read about exploits for both platforms that were discovered in the wild. I guess what I'm saying is the same precautions should be taken on these platforms as you would take on a windows pc.
Finally, regardless of your computer, if someone wants to target you, and they're sophisticated enough, they will break in to your system. You can buy yourself time with encryption, but in the end you need to be able to identify and respond to targeted attacks quickly.
In summary, put your PC behind a firewall, maintain it, and make sure you have a detection system in place. Also, don't install every piece of software that comes along. Even if it isn't malicious, it could accidentally punch a hole in your security.

The math problem we're trying to solve has many possible answers. The type of problem is called a "hash." Hashes are hard to predict the answers to. In normal math, 1+1=2 and 1+2=3. But with hashes 1+1=2 and 1+2=4324654326322gfdgg2gq1fq. Hashes are silly like that. There are many kinds of hashes that do a lot of really neat things. The answer to the type of hash Bitcoin uses is always 256 bits long - that's 64 letters and numbers when displayed to you and me.
Since there are many answers to the math problem, the Bitcoin software makes up special rules that the answer has to meet. It might say, "The first 10 numbers have to be 0!" Since the Bitcoin software is what pays the miner, the miner has to find an answer that starts with 10 zeros. If the miner finds 9 zeros and says, "This is good enough!" and tries to get paid, all the other bitcoin miners will laugh at him, call him names, and make him go back to finding the answer the Bitcoin software wants.
Since you can never tell what the answer you're going to get is, miners can add and remove stuff from the problem to get the best answer. One of the things they can include is other bitcoin users' transactions. The other bitcoin users want the miners to use their transaction, because no one will believe the transaction happened until someone uses it in their answer! 
The Bitcoin software wants to find a new answer every ten minutes. Once every two weeks or so the Bitcoin software will look at how long answers took and then it asks for more or less zeros to make it easier or harder to find an acceptable answer.
tl;dr: The protocol says what math they use, and the numbers come (mostly) from users sending bitcoin.

You're changing topics here. A DDOS is different than selfish mining. One is an attack against a website, the other is a theoretical but improbable attack against the network.
The 'selfish mining' attack was presented by Professor Sirer. It was discussed here, in depth. [This]( is one of the first posts on it. Also on bitcointalk.org. Also in  The consensus was this attack would be incredibly difficult to pull off. 


I thought I just engaged you in debate about the protocol? You were the one that kept bringing it back to price (bitcoin related sites can be ddosed, market manipulation, etc). 
There are 80,000 people in this sub. A lot of them are here because the price is rising quickly, and that's exciting to watch. You can't really fault them for that. I do feel it is appropriate to fault you for ignoring the evidence of your own experience over the last hour and change. 
I can further fault you for resorting to vulgarity, strawmen, and gishgallops when confronted with assertions that pose problems for your claims. If you would like a higher level of discourse you are expected to present it yourself.
To restate my understanding of our positions, I am not asserting that bitcoin is perfect. I am refuting the claims you've made against the protocol. I have acknowledged the price is vulnerable to manipulation, and I have made claims (documented [here]( that the community is aware of the possibility of market manipulation. You have asserted a selfish mining attack has happened.
I am not aware of the successful selfish mining attack. Can you give me a link please?

Its a question of market penetration and market volatility. Right now the relative value of a btc can swing a percentage in a few hours. This means there is risk in holding a btc.

Oh, best wallet. Right. Well, the official client is the only wallet I've used for mining. I think you need to use it? Blockchain.info is a lot more convenient for day-to-day use. A lot of people are using coinbase.net, which offers a quick way to get your hands on some btc. I don't know if coinbase has an app or mobile friendly ui. I can confirm blockchain's app is fine.

Its hard to get the majority to side with the worst criminals our society can produce (well... The worst solitary criminals) even if it is the more compassionate stance to take. 
Personally speaking I don't feel too bad about the last guy getting executed and while I believe the system failed the next guy, he also failed society. I would like a better solution in general, but since the impacted population is so small (more people die from deer accidents a year  than the every state's execution combined) and unsympathetic I don't expect to see it happen.
Edit: fact checked the deer statistic, they are responsible for 200 deaths a year in the US per Wikipedia. Execution peaked at 90 deaths in the mid 90s.

Blockchain.info isn't a malicious company so far as anyone knows, and I personally keep some money there. However, a web wallet is a lot like a traditional paper money wallet. You don't want to have more money in there than you need in case someone wants to rob you. 
With Bitcoin *You Are Your Own Bank.* Your traditional bank takes security very seriously. You should too. 
I gather this is a 12 day experiment. Assuming you have a very strong password (16+ letters, numbers, and symbols. Use words if you must, but don't forget about numbers and punctuation, and don't use something from a book/song/wikipedia article/etc) on your blockchain.info account you'll probably be fine.
If you're thinking about doing something a bit more serious let me know via PM and I'll try to walk you through setting up something appropriate for your needs.

Is mining worth it? You'll likely pay more for electricity than you'll earn in btc. There are specialized devices coming out now called ASIC rigs. These promise to mine faster using less energy. They are the messiah of the mining world, but it is too early to tell if they are false profits (sorry, had to make the pun). Butterfly Labs will be shipping their rigs in a few weeks. Avalon has a few of their rigs in the wild. If you were to buy from either company you'd wait months for product.
Is buying bitcoins worth it? Yes. Is now the time to buy? Maybe. If you're buying btc to spend right away or to make a long term investment, buy now! If your goal is to buy low and sell high, wait for then price to sag. If you have no plans for your coin, buy now! 
Remember, btc is a young currency and the exchange rate fluctuates a lot. Don't panic if a coin you buy today is worth significantly less tomorrow. It will probably be worth more than you paid for it within 5 years.

Pass phases are great and all, but do you know what all of the passwords I retrieve from hash dumps have in common? They're under 16 characters or they don't have numbers and punctuation. 
The reason I cut it off at 16 characters is because by that point I usually have more passwords than I'd need to do damage, and 17 characters would take substantially longer. If I'm going to steal money from blockchain, I'll probably crack passwords for as long as possible before making my attack. Exhausting possibilities from a word list is a lot easier when I don't have to deal with munging special characters.
I like last pass and keepass for password generation. I agree that creating a password from your brain is less effective.

I suspect ASIC miners are betting on the price rising significantly. Especially now that they're getting hardware that cost them thousands of dollars that may/may not pay for itself. I just looked at my previous attempt at GPU mining in September 2012. If I would have held the coins to sell at the right time I would have come out in the black despite my rig being very inefficient. To be clear: it's a huge gamble, and not a sound business strategy for someone thinking about getting in to mining.

Buying during market lag is like guessing where a drop of rain will fall during a storm. The more time you give the order, the more likely it is to go through, but it is just a guessing game. If the exact price in one of these high volume periods matters to you, maybe reconsider your investing style. If you're going to continue this style, remember to stick to your guns until the lag is gone.

The standard abbreviation is BTC. As demand increases and supply decreases price goes up. This is true for anything, assuming a third party is not artificially influencing the market (laws, trade sanctions, protected monopolies, etc).

Think of a "wallet" like an account. Coinbase will make one for you automatically. You may also want to make your own by downloading a bitcoin client. Popular choices include the Armory client and the Bitcoin-QT. Be warned, clients that require you to download the entire blockchain (such as Bitcoin-qt) will take a long time to get ready.
"Key" in the connotation of bitcoins are "public keys" and "private keys." Your *public key* is the address you give out to people to send bitcoin to.  Most people will never directly interact with their *private key*.

Yep, bitcoin is volatile. Who would want to hold that? Hint: take a long view look at the charts.

For context I notified one btc exchange of a vulnerability that could lead to a ddos. They gave me $25 (at the time). I notified another about an issue that could lead to customers losing their coins a few months ago. They haven't fixed it, but they told me they plan to. They never gave me anything for the heads up either. I no longer do business on that exchange.

As of right now they've said they're working on it and the vulnerability requires the customer's machine to be compromised. Changing a website can take time, so I'm willing to give them a few months. As such I'm not sure it's ethical for me to call them out. Also I'd have to write the code to demonstrate the exploit, and I'm not in a huge hurry to put my other projects on the back burner to make that happen.
I stopped using their exchange because 1) they didn't jump on the problem right away and 2) their 'thank you' was a bit half-hearted. I have no evidence that they're doing anything irresponsible or unethical.
I'll check back with them in a few weeks to make sure they're doing what they said they would. If they haven't, well... morally I'm beholden to the community, ethically... I'm not sure. I'll have to consult other security analysts. 
To protect yourself, make sure your AV is up to date, don't do finances and porn/piracy on the same machine, and practice good digital hygiene. Also, never keep more money than is required on a machine you don't control. This is bitcoin rule  It doesn't matter what exchange you're using. Any system can be subverted. Make yourself a small and difficult target so potential thieves either overlook you or get distracted by the shiny hordes of cash sitting on web-based wallets (blockchain.info, the exchanges, etc).

When I was dealing at  on freenode, I didn't really care about where you came from. I'd sell bitcoins to anyone provided they could pay in a means I could accept and were willing to pay a fee to mitigate my risk. I'll assume your goal is to buy bitcoins for the rest of this.
Depending on who you talk to that fee ranges between 8% and 10%. The fees often skewed outside of that range depending on who else was selling, or what the market was doing. You will likely be responsible for fees.
SEPA transfers often seemed to be a huge problem for Europeans. If you run into that kind of sitation, paypal will convert your currency to USD --for a fee. There's usually a few people around who'll take Paypal USD.

I probably should have picked a better title for that category; it used to raise the hairs on the back of my neck as I have a foot in the water of the skeptical community. I figured I may as well try to "take it back."
I think bitcoins are endlessly *cool* in the same way that I think of progressive rock music. Bitcoins could hit $0 and I'd still mine them just to play with the tech. In that sense I am a true believer. 
Any goals or ambitions implied by the phrase are sort of incidental. I'd like to see bitcoins become the global reserve currency or whatever, but I don't have any expectations for it.
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:58:08
That's hard to answer. Right now we're a bit overpowered (by most estimates) so people are expected to drop out. I believe the network is running at about 3 petahashes/second right now. That is pretty significant and would probably be able to withstand attacks from *most* governments. The same could be said for 2 petahashes/second, which is probably closer to the equilibrium at btc's current exchange rate. 
So, tldr: A first world nation would have to invest significant resources to attack bitcoin at current levels.

Are there any tumbling services that can handle that kind of volume? As I understand it you send n bitcoins to an address and the address sends back n*.x bitcoins from someone else to the address you specify. That means to tumble these would require a service that's sitting on a significant portion of 27k btc. Also, isn't doing that technically money laundering? It'd be pretty funny if they tried.
I think these coins are marked for a while unless they are dumped on an exchange. If they do dump them on an exchange, I really hope it's Mt. Gox. That'd be HIlarious.

No coins will be minted, however coins will continue to be lost via failed harddrives and the like. Because bitcoin is infinitely divisible, as long as a few satoshi exist we will not have a problem - bitcoins will just be worth more.

It's better for the overall network for you to have a copy of the blockchain. Does it help you at all? Not really.
I don't use coinbase myself, so I'm not sure what you're looking at. I made an account real fast and clicked 'request money.' It generated a QR code and gave me this address: 1F57cGRYeC3LeMd7B4ygHLsCBB7sPVbBJ5. That is my public address.  Note: one private address can generate multiple public addresses. I imagine I can probably make a few more through them if I so choose. 
I've never heard of bitcoinget before just now. These services tend to be more trouble than they're worth. Your mileage may very, but yeah... go ahead and stick the address generated from coinbase's 'request money' button in there.

The idea of tipping gw girls money is a prickly (ha!) one. For some people there is a line between exhibitionism and being a pornogropher that they would rather not cross. Adding money to the mix will blur that line.

I was mining on SLI'd and overclocked 570s. If I recall correctly I was going at about 240 mhash/sec. I'd make .05btc every 36-48 hours. On average lets say I made .2btc/week. My electric bill went up by about $40. If all factors but the price of bitcoins remained the same, I'd currently be taking a ~$20/month loss GPU mining.
I'm told you can do all sorts of neat stuff to cut your costs and make a profit on it, but it seems like a lot of work. If you're thinking about mining, I'd wait a few months to see what happens to the first few waves of ASIC miners. I should be getting a pair of BFL jalapinos in a few months. PM me about it if the answer isn't already apparent at that point.
If you're still not sure, look for a mining profitability calculator like [this one]( and crunch the numbers yourself.

Have you ever read Daemon? This computer programmer sets up a bunch of scripts that trigger based on events and eventually rules the world with these scripts - posthumously. Here's what I'd do if I were DPR last year.
Script 1) watch RSS for "Dread Pirate Roberts" and "Arrested." Trigger 48 hour timer. When expired empty wallet to address A.
Script 2) Wait for deposit to appear on Blockchain. Mux N bitcoins. Transfer the remainder to address B. 
Script 3) trigger 48 hour timer on address B getting bitcoin. Mux N bitcoins, transfer the remainder to address C.
Scripts 2 and 3 repeat, hosted on various servers across diverse geographic regions. Muxed coins get spread out among a variety of addresses owned by my staff, various faucets, and I'd also have a "legal defense fund" that'd mysteriously get donations. I'd probably stash a quarter of my profits in a personal address just in case I get out.
Edit: thinking about this: the delay should be a random number between 5 and 2880 minutes. The muxing services should also be from a random list, and if possible, no muxxer should be used twice. The percentage muxxed should be a low arbitrary percentage, capped at some upper limit of coins, and the scripts should loop until approximately 96% of coins have been sent.

I'm not feeling the justification for this price.

Right now I have a pile of fiat that's inflating like crazy and I've got bitcoin, which seems to be losing it's goddamn mind. 
Where's the middle ground? Is this the argument for litecoin that has been eluding me?
To nip this argument in the bud: I'm not saying that bitcoin will never be worth $46.35, or $50, or $10,000. I'm saying I'm not sure we've got the support at this point. Also, I did cash out my short term fund. I feel bad for doing it, but I'm playing the swings anyway - this swing set just seems a bit lopsided.

Maximum penalty for this is 5 years. Since it's a new regulation and assuming Gox's lawyers are smart enough to keep Mark appearing humble in front of the judge, they'll get a fine. Gox and it's US partners will make sure to have the appropriate licenses, and that'll be that.

Think of them like two graphs. The one on Mt Gox has a line graph and a bar graph-looking thing. The line graph indicates the volume, or number of trades done at a given time.

I'm a seller. I won't push you to my ad, because honestly I think that's a bit tacky.
Here's what I'd suggest: if you can't find someone in your area with enough feedback to make you feel comfortable, make sure you meet publicly. Do a smaller transaction. Understand it is more difficult to get bitcoin back than cash, the seller may ask you to present the money first. Personally, I'm willing to take the risk with buyers who are uncomfortable, but I'm not a big fan of it.
Finally, localbitcoins charges a percentage for every transaction. They also flag reviews from low volume transactions. If your seller's reviews do not have that flag, they would have paid some money to do the fake review.

I think the flaw in your plan will become apparent to you fairly shortly.
If you're only buying/selling off of there, you'll probably do okay short term. However, you're not giving yourself much margin for the risk (the first person to screw you will likely eat all of your profits and then some, market volatility, etc). Also, at least in my experience, most orders tend to be under $500. So, on a good day you get two $500 orders. You're running around town, you're taking some risk and what are you getting? $40. On an average day? You're making closer to $20. 
If a deal isn't going to cover the cost of a mocha for me to drink while I sit and wait for the customer to show up, I'm not sure why I'd bother.

I have heard the lotto metaphor before, but it never quite sat right with me and I didn't know why. I was thinking about it this afternoon and it came to me - the order of events is off. You see, every miner knows in advance what the next block will look like (IE the number of zeros), even if they don't know which transactions will be in there. To make the lotto metaphor to be accurate you have to describe it like this:
Yesterday's Powerball numbers were announced. No one won, so the lottery commissioner made a special machine that only allows people to buy quick-pick tickets. The commissioner will pay out a percentage of the prize to anyone who gets the number. 
I'm probably just being pedantic. I don't mean to say the Lotto metaphor is bad, it certainly gets the point across.

There are a few types of offline wallets - software clients, brain wallets, and paper wallets. There are also a lot of ways to secure a private key by breaking them up and trusting pieces of it to certain people in such a way that it takes a significant fraction of them to agree to unlock the wallet.
The use case of each is different, which is why I suggest either doing a lot of reading or talk to someone who has done that reading to come up with a plan that makes sense for you. I'm trying to convince the IT Security company I work for to start looking at a bitcoin consulting group. I'd probably test my ideas out on you (so, it'd be a semi-professional consultation - not backed by my company, but they'd be interested in the results). 
As far as transferring between clients, sure, that's possible and easy. What I'd suggest is to create a brand new wallet and send the funds from the old wallet to the new one.
For your other questions, I suspect Erik Voorheese (would be a great resource for this kind of information in general, being the knowledgeable and press friendly awesome guy that he is.
I believe Satoshi is still the largest single holder of bitcoins, but MtGox, BitPay, and Coinbase might be in the same ball park. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that Erik Voorheese is up there too. I haven't really done the analysis on it, so take that as the shot in the dark that it is.

Your criticisms are often barbed with personal attacks. That's rude. You're also committing logical fallacies. Thus downvotes.
The "selfish miner" attack is a fun intellectual exercise. However, what would happen to the confidence in bitcoin if the attack were executed? It'd drop like a rock. What would the malicious actors get? Worthless bits. Another consequence of this attack is a blockchain fork. Legitimate users continue on the "unaltered" fork and what's lost? 10 minutes and maybe some damage to the exchange rate.

You will never know for sure that your system is free of backdoors unless you design, build, and code your own system, starting at the processor dye.
Do I think China ordered their factories to put a back door into routers? Yes. Do I think the US has compromised Windows to some degree? Yes. Have I, or anyone I know, spent the time to validate the Linux kernel? No. Would we be able to catch a clever backdoor? Probably not.
It boils down to risk. Are these global powers likely to invoke their god-like wrath to ruin your day? Probably not. If these backdoors exist, they are currently out of reach from the typical hacker.
Out of the box a modern Windows PC is riddled with holes. You know this, so you turn on windows update and put the machine behind a router. Maybe you install an av. At this point you're reasonably secure and the only person likely to change that is you and the third party software you install.
Linux and Mac PCs present a smaller surface area to hackers, and their low market share gives them a kind of reverse herd immunity. That said, I have never personally worked on a nix/Mac box that has any sort of detection mechanism in place above the core os. I have read about exploits for both platforms that were discovered in the wild. I guess what I'm saying is the same precautions should be taken on these platforms as you would take on a windows pc.
Finally, regardless of your computer, if someone wants to target you, and they're sophisticated enough, they will break in to your system. You can buy yourself time with encryption, but in the end you need to be able to identify and respond to targeted attacks quickly.
In summary, put your PC behind a firewall, maintain it, and make sure you have a detection system in place. Also, don't install every piece of software that comes along. Even if it isn't malicious, it could accidentally punch a hole in your security.

That is very good advice. I'm keeping it closed source for now until I can find a design pattern that makes any sort of sense to someone who isn't me.
Until that point, I can only offer signs that indicate I'm not a bad actor: I'm in the four year club on reddit - I don't really want to burn this profile. I'm a reasonably active on this sub. I have some OSS stuff on my site.  The post on oAuth to Stack Overflow has my name (Bill Strait) on it. I'm also very lovable. 
That said: don't blindly trust me or anyone peddling software online. Install it on a virtual machine, or better yet a dummy computer. Watch what traffic comes from the box once the application is installed. Is it going somewhere it shouldn't? That's a bad sign. Set up a dummy wallet (in the case of bitcoin related stuff) - and maybe throw some loose change in there. Does the wallet get touched when it's not supposed to be touched? Are funds moving around that shouldn't be? That's a bad sign. Even if they don't, there could be a logic bomb. Be wary.
From my perspective: I'm trying to build a reputation. I'm not sure how to do that without telling people about what I'm doing. I'm asking for you to trust me on your computer. I realize that's a big thing to ask, and I'm just some stranger on the internet. I can only assure you that I respect and value that trust.

It'd be a series of deterministic wallets. Since all scripts are passive until triggered and sit on an empty brain wallet that will only contain money for under 3,000 minutes I view the threat to be small. It is a risk though, splitting the payments to multiple addresses on each hop would mitigate this.
The initial script that's watching RSS would trigger a subtle alert that you would know to look for. That initial 48 hours is your chance to stop it.
Edit: the only noticeable thing that script should do is move the coins out of the initial wallet. By the time it executes the coins are in the wind and the clock is ticking before they hop again. As long as you covered your tracks during the setup and maintenance of these servers you should be fine.
Also, these servers could be raspberry pis that you leave behind when you go to a party or at a name tag job with poor it security (a local diner for instance).

I'm planning on giving the app it's own site once I get my target initial feature set implemented. I think that's got three or four more revs. The idea behind the blog/posting to reddit is to get people interested in it and to give the community a chance to get involved in shaping it. I totally get that installing the software as it stands is a gamble, and I don't expect everyone to take that leap.
As I mentioned, the next change is to get the source in a legible state so that I won't feel dirty sharing it. At that point people can build their own with no risk and I expect to see an uptick in downloads. I'm just not there yet. 
As far as .NET =&gt; Mono ports, one of us has bad information, and it could very well be me. I'm in the middle of something else, so I can't research it but I thought Mono was structured to mirror .NET's class structure. Since an HTTP client is the most advanced class I'm using (other than the ui) I can't imagine it being too rough. That said, I've never developed anything for Linux before and, while I love the idea of Linux, I'm not in a huge rush to get going on it.
I get paid to write .NET code. For the web (read: IIS, not apache). I'm probably not going to switch my primary OS any time soon, I'm pretty embedded in Microsoft-land.

Seriously though, btc has had more uses than drug trade and gambling for a while now. That argument was thin a year ago, and I'd say its completely invalid today. 
In my opinion the value of bitcoin is justified based on its potential utility. When that utility is fully realized I don't think a full bitcoin will be within the reach of the common man.

The attack, as I understand it, involves forking the blockchain. If it's happening, good for them. The chain with the longest length is the one that's used, but not blindly. When a fork is detected it will be checked. This has actually happened before, March of this year. A block that older clients recognized as valid was added to the block chain, but newer client's did not recognize it. It was picked up nearly immediately. The invalid block was rolled back and the main fork continued.
A similar event would happen in a 'selfish mining' attack. Assuming it's been going on for years, I imagine some reconciliation would have to be done. It'd be painful, but it's not world shattering.
Also, they'd have to out-compete the regular chain to grow theirs faster. The difficulty should keep their output at 1 block per ten minutes, unless the modify the protocol in which case their blocks are invalid. 
Now here's how the market defeats the attack before it begins: Users of mining pools are expecting a block every n minutes (depending on their pool's hash rate). If it falls too far below that threshold (which it would if the attacker were hording valid blocks) they leave. If they can't spend/get their payout, they leave.
This attack is theoretically possible, but the effort and cost to pull it off makes it infeasable. I would ask you what homework you've done beyond reading Professor Sirer's paper (if you got that far)? Have you looked at the protocol? Have you read any of the checks done in the QT client? Have you looked at similar events in the past?

It's not a call our federal government can make. There are 16 of 50 states that prohibit it, and the majority of the remaining 34 only exercise it for murder, and even then it is rarely carried out. Of the three scheduled for this month, two are expected to be stayed. Next month has the largest amount on the calendar, with 10. Four of those have been or will be stayed. Considering the murder rates that get lauded over Americans so often, I believe that shows significant restraint in using capital punishment. 
Also, the man who is sentenced to death this month? He was previously convicted of manslaughter. When he got out of jail on that charge he was convicted of possession of controlled substances. He then stabbed a man to death in 1999. I'm not sure how many more chances he should be given.
The last person to be put to death raped and killed two elderly women over the course of a year. He was the 5th person executed this year. Edit: My mistake, he was the 5th person in Oklahoma to be executed this year. There have been 43 nation wide this year.

They are money. If you're asking how their value is determined, it happens in much the same way that the value of a dollar is determined. They are worth what you can get for them, or what you're willing to give up to get them. When I was 16 I could get a gallon of gas for $1. Now a dollar is worth somewhere between 1/3 and 1/4 gallons. You can say the price of gas went up, or the value of the dollar measured in gas went down. You can make the same kind of statement between any two currencies that exist.


Assuming the price of bitcoins relative to the dollar rises? $.01. 
Various exchanges charge different fees. Most are between .6 and .2 percent. There are varying means of getting funds to the exchanges that will charge varying amounts. 


The 10,000 foot view of mining is this: like folding Skype, or bit torrent, a group of computers join together on the internet to accomplish a task. In bitcoins case these computers are attempting to verify person a had funds and that those funds were given to person b. This is called verifying a transaction. If a miner finds a transaction to be valid, it will attempt to use it to update the running ledger, called the blockchain, with that transaction. If a miner believes it has an update to the blockchain that meets the networks rules, it publishes it to the network, along with a note claiming the fees and any network provided reward. Other miners will inspect this update, and if they believe it to be valid they add it to their copy of the blockchain.

We're pretty sure a viable quantum computer is a long ways off. Once one exists sha256 is dead. A large portion of internet security is based on sha256. You probably use sha when you go to your bank's site, Amazon, gmail, Facebook, the check out page of any reasonably secure website, and so on. 
If a quantum computer appears with no warning the global economy will tank. It is therefore likely that anyone who is close will announce it (so that people will still have money to buy their product) and it will be vetted by Top Men. When that happens the W3C will be shouting about SSL/TLS dying from the top of their lungs. Thankfully both TLS and Bitcoin are modular enough that we can do something about it.

Litigation, especially out of state, is expensive. Odds are you wouldn't get a return.

Sorry to hijack, but I'm [working on making a desktop ticker]( Which desktop ticker are you using? Would you consider switching to a different ticker if it had customizable alerts? If not, what other features would you need to see?

10-12% markup seems to be typical. If you want the lower rates, get on an exchange. Cheap or easy, pick one.

I'll just leave [this]( here.

I hang out in  on freenode a lot. There has never been a BFL employee in that channel. Were you mistaken or were you in some other channel/server?

I'm not sure what a log chart is supposed to show. Someone want to save me a trip to Google?
Edit: I went to google. [This is what it told me.]( - percentage instead of dollars. Got it.

Hah, Jonathan is great. This sort of post would be most welcome over in @_date: 2013-07-16 22:02:00
I had that happen to me today. It took 30 minutes to show up on Localbitcoins. Blockchain.info didn't see the transaction until the first confirmation hit.

A lot of fraud losses get passed back to the merchant. The credit card companies do very little on that front. An escrow resolves the issue by arbitrating any issues that may arise during the transaction. Essentially, the person that is unable to prove they held up their end is held accountable immediately. Reputation scores and/or escrow privileges may also be impacted as a result. Does that clear it up?

1btc a month is not enough to get into the mining game. You might be able to buy shares of asicminer if you save up a few months.

Interesting. You're renting your cpu out to the pool, and (assuming) the pool pays you even if no one found a block....makes sense to me. That probably means it's illegal.

You know those card readers for iPhones they sell at Starbucks? If there's an android version, a fellow could make a decent living on localbitcoins.com. Edit: [Works on Android]( I am now a portable ATM. Still, I'd like to have something that sits out in the world.

If you're looking to make a profit, I'm going to say probably not. If you want to add to the security of the network, go for it. Just remember to keep your client up to date.

People use their computers to solve math problems that everyone who uses bitcoin needs solved. As a reward, the first person to solve the problem gets some bitcoins of their own. Some people get into big groups and promise to share the reward if they find it. 
Let me know what aspect of mining is unclear and I'll try to explain that...

I spent a good chunk of my morning reading up on ripple. I can't see how it operates as an exchange. I still need to go through gateways to do anything, which I can do just as well without ripple.

You are amazing. Thanks!

The signature only demonstrates that the code is the same between the source and destination. It does not demonstrate the code should be trusted.
