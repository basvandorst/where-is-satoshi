This is most likely temporary, T-Mobile in Poland very rarely promotes electronic fund transfers with exception of those originating from TM branded bank accounts. Some, like Orange do these all the time - I don't mean BTC but other online methods like bank transfer, credit/debit card etc. T-Mobile have one of the worst prepaid offerings on the market too and are famous for billing you for checking account balance with USSD code (0.01 EUR).

Most if not every polish carrier promotes electronic payment channels (payment gateways, credit/debit card) with such bonuses. I must say, this is unexpected anyway. I do not follow BTC that much nowadays (it was cool when I mined my GPUs worth back in the day) and most news are not that good these days, like polish banks closing BTC related accounts etc.
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:43:41
That won't make much sense once BTC trades below $10 again.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:03:13
I hope for no polish BTC subreddit ever. Our exchange (it does EUR too) is pretty decent but very prone to lag.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:15:16
Since you can estimate it just by looking at it, I'm guessing 0.05 Hash/s.

It's Gox. They could disable API, reintroduce normal fees and have bots off their backs for a moment. Don't hate the player, hate the game.

I recently sold few game keys at 0.1btc with escrow and didn't get scammed. I'd be careful with something more expensive but with physical goods I guess you could appeal to BitMit with some proof.
I'm kinda disappointed with sales volume but that's a given at this point.

You provide valuable insight (thanks) and you are downvoted in return. The amount of butthurt in this thread is astonishing.
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:49:16
So what's your point exactly? My point was that bubbles don't go "pop" except some initial drop in price, it's a much slower process than most people realize. Bubble pop happened 10 days ago and people seem to get increasingly excited since the price is rising again.

Like 6 months in case of the first BTC bubble? Or any long timeframe most bubbles in history?
Fuck the facts lol, BTC ho!

Keep in mind that butterflylabs is most likely a scam.

Getting over 50% hashing power of mining pools. Expensive but not that much to pretty much any big country.
@_date: 2013-03-07 14:14:32
You do realize that like with stock exchange there are people pushing their own agendas?
Some people want market to crash so they can stock up on BTC and profit even faster.
Other people would want stable growth because they don't want to keep  open at all times.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:54:32
It doesn't really offer anything of great importance over traditional means of funds transfrerring in case of legal transactions. It's better in some ways but not enough to make people switch.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:38:18
Which died even harder than Gox yesterday.
The thing is, every major exchange goes down if the Gox goes down.

Rewriting them to do calls via website would take little time but they bank on high frequency and APIs are just way more efficient.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:56:30
Eh, I sold as soon prices were going down fast, bought once they started climbing back, made it out with about 15% more BTC. I actually hoped it would crash further since I had a hunch it would climb back soon. Didn't expect it to so soon though. BTC hit about 27USD at one point on the exchange I use.

Oh, so Vanitygen finally works with HD7xxx GPUs, yay. Wouldn't know if it wasn't for this post.

Amount of delays and still no working sample.
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:16:09
There's one that allows up to 225W.
They are too expensive anyway. You could build a simple PC (without PSU) that could accomodate 3+ GPUs at cost of more powerful ViDocks.

@_date: 2013-04-20 19:51:35
No, I'm saying the current price changes are low enough not to rule out that this bubble won't play out as most of bubbles in history.
@_date: 2013-02-11 08:58:08
No GPU won't pay for itself now with FPGA and ASIC boards outperforming them significantly.
AMD GPUs are way faster at computing hashes but when you account mining difficulty, power consumption and strain you're putting on your gaming hardware (my guess) it makes it a loss in terms of money for you.
If you're hell bent on mining on GPUs (you have access to free electricity etc - don't be a jerk to your parents or dorm though!) then I'll add that you don't need SLI/Crossfire. It's actually advised againt actually IIRC, just use multiple unbridged GPUs.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:38:27
Hope so too, just to see ASIC miners grind their teeth :D

Honestly, 3% is low given how easy and widespread that method is. PayPal can go f themselves though.


Just do your books right and if you can't then hire third party accounting company. I doubt you're going to do your taxes based on blockchain log anytime soon.

Their infrastructure is not able to scale with this load. They could mitigate this by disabling API until they could solve this. It's a lesser of two evils and I'm guessing it's easier to do than rebuilding their engine.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:44:47
Bitcurex is up to 126. Small exchanges are weird like that.

Good luck getting fund there.
@_date: 2013-06-14 10:29:58
I was pretty sure it was a scam. If you don't want to call it a gamble then call it very risky investment. I'd still be quite angry at their incompetence since you've ordered your hardware a year ago and would be much better off if you got it in the timeframe that BFL promised.

I can do a chargeback if a seller from China doesn't deliver me what I wanted. You're going to the court to solve this? Good luck with that.
And while PayPal is the worst, stuff like Google Checkout is pretty fair.

Theory more or less fits 
I'm from Poland and it works here. People from other countries confirming that it works for them are usually from places on that list too.

Hate to burst your bubble but during the first BTC bubble it lost about 50% of value and it hovered around that price with some fluctuation for a long time. It took few months for it to actually reach the lowest value. Even if BTC seems to stabilize now I wouldn't dare to say if it's over.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:12:55
Bitcoin price should never be a measure of success. The only real value it provides to the network at the moment is increased security thanks to more miners, nothing more until actual "market cap" of BTC (as a currency as opposed to stock shares) is reached.

This thing sounds like a scam. It supposedly uses Amazon EC2 and doesn't mention GPU computing at all. Assuming that they do use that (Amazon GPGPU is based on Nvidia CUDA IIRC) it still pretty much a crapshot at any kind of cryptography and password cracking.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:32:53
It all depends on electricity costs, it's around 0.09c where I live so it's still profitable with GPU.
