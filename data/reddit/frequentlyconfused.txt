You're going to love that phone!  I've had mine for about three weeks now - such an improvement over the M7.

I've gotten a bunch in my single-transaction cold wallets.  I also just checked all the paper wallet addresses I gave out over the holidays and some of those have gotten them too. None of the addresses I use frequently for small transactions have gotten any at all.  
Would this affect one's ability to, say, sweep one of these cold wallets into Blockchain.info and transfer the coins somewhere to be spent or sold?  Is this someone's strange attempt to slow the sale of Bitcoins to keep the market up?

Is there a list of credit card issuers who treat this as a cash advance?  If I had to guess, I wouldn't use my Chase cards based on their stance on bitcoin.

The minute she loses that dragon, you're going to have to sweep those coins into another wallet.  It may be more practical to only leave the public key in the dragon so she can "watch" her money if she wants to, while you guys can hold on to the private key until she's old enough to use it.

Not a noob per se, just wondering if anyone has compiled a central list of the various exchanges and their fees for buying and selling BTC.  If not, do you think we should start one?

I've got dibs on CorrectHorseBatteryStaple, guys.

So does this completely negate any chance of getting our coins back from the September debacle?  I have a few coins tied up in that mess, not nearly as much as some people, but it's still something.  I basically wrote them off at the time, but since he's made a couple of small repayments, I was getting optimistic again.  
Oh well.
