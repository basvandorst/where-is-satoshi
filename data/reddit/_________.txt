I think it has long term potential but wouldn't be surprised if it crashed to 2-6k sometime in the next few months. 
Equally I wouldn't be surprised if it rose to 13-15k in the next few months.

It's apples and oranges though. You say we can collectively raise the cap on bitcoin, but how would that work exactly? 
When governments increase supply it's a hidden tax which gives the government money by devaluing the money everyone else holds. There's no such core body in Bitcoin who would be able to give themselves more Bitcoin regardless of what other parties want as any such attempt would just result in the formation of a new chain which no one else would want to use. 
 
Taking a different approach then;
Bitcoin's are sub dividable to 100 million Satoshis. If you just increase the number of bitcoins everyone has (say by a factor of 10) it's meaningless as you've just changed things so that Bitcoin are sub dividable to one extra useless digit. 
If instead, you decide to increase the supply by increasing the block reward - who would be willing to accept that? Only miners as everyone who is holding Bitcoin would have their holdings diminished. In such a case users would want to stay on the old non-increased supply chain, and you would probably see game theory resulting in it being in the best interests of individual miners to stay on the old chain.

In case you're still answering questions, Why do you intend on returning the "extra" money the bankruptcy laws could give you? (I.e. Moral Code/Religon/Misc...)

Could be that when it's over the threshold mining covers the electricity costs and when it's under it doesn't. That way it would make sense to stop mining.
At least if we assume that he has an auto-sell set up somehow, and doesn't have any faith that it will rise up to the threshold again after it falls once (else mining and holding would work).
