That’s just a historical artifact and you know it.

Not at all. I’m a software engineer, so I have a good idea of what they’re dealing with at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:50
This isn’t childish at all.

What’s the block capacity increase using only SegWit transactions vs. only non-SegWit transactions, as a percentage?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:34:03
I’d buy more.

Maybe that’s a good thing. Perhaps this planet doesn’t need exponential economic growth.

Calm down. They’re trying to cope with a massive influx of traffic and new users.

If you want the app to auto trade, it can’t do so without access to your exchange’s API. As far as I know, exchanges typically allow you to generate multiple API keys, each with specific permissions. If that’s the case, generate a new API key specifically for this purpose with only the permissions required to auto trade on the exchange. But also research the auto trade service first.

The worst I see happening is deeper and longer dips, which creates great buying opportunities for true hodlers. In the long term, the underlying value of Bitcoin will win out over speculation. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are solid.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:45:23
Unlikely. Transaction fees are based on demand for space in a block.

I wouldn’t mind as long as it’s a high quality group. Most Bitcoin groups on Facebook are low quality, so it would be good to know what the good ones are. If it’s another low quality group (and be honest with yourself), don’t post it here. This sub is very tightly moderated.

Your free coins in the fork
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:48:40
That’s assuming there are enough pending transactions to mine a big block. No big block, no fork. Exchanges may well suspend BTC transfers in and out around the time of the expected fork so there aren’t enough transactions to mine a big block unless someone spams the mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:46:57
Assuming you plan to hodl, you can regularly sweep your BTC, ETH and/or LTC balance held on Coinbase to a paper or hardware wallet. The frequency of the sweep is a balance between transaction fees and risk.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:19:06
You’re not allowed to discuss altcoins here. See the rules.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:51:32
Well that would be a nice way to pump up the price for existing hodlers. The Winklevi would become quadrillionaires overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:20:16
It sounds like you have the BIP39 seed for two wallets, as a BIP39 seed consists of 12 words. Hopefully multisig, in this case, means two signatures.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:42:14
The person sending BTC sets the fee. The block size is finite and when there are more pending transactions than will fit into a new block, miners will likely choose the pending transactions offering the highest fees. Think about miners putting your pending transaction into a new block as them performing a service. In times of scarcity, the price for that service will increase due to market forces (supply and demand).
Also, the fee is proportional to the size of the transaction in bytes, not the value (in BTC) of the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:55:09
Just fork the source of Bitcoin Core, change a few constants, and BOOM - instant money. You’d also have to adapt some mining software and start mining blocks.

If nation states create their own cryptocurrencies, they’d open themselves up to 51% attacks by larger, hostile nation states.

If there are big dips I most definitely will buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:58
Just go through the password reset process if you have access to the email address you used to register with Coinbase, especially if you have already verified your identification. Otherwise yes, start a new account.

Charlie Lee dumped all his LTC, so maybe not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:49:52
He said so, therefore it’s true. Check and mate. You win.

Sure, let’s go with that.

Your post is extremely authoritarian. If someone says something you don’t agree with, according to you they should have their money taken away from them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:10:56
No. Suppose you held 1 BTC as of block n.  A new crypto called BXX is created by forking from block n. You then hold 1 BTC and 1 BXX. If BXX is worth $50, for example, your total holdings are equivalent to $15050.

As opposed to six months after it was announced it would come out in six months?

By the way, whatever you do, don’t enter those words into any online service. You’d be taking a big risk.

If the fork took place, I would have seen that as a significant event but also Bitcoin working as expected and a successful demonstration that Bitcoin doesn’t have one central point of control. Having said that, there was a huge bug discovered after the hard fork was aborted which could have had dire consequences. I heard that the bug has been fixed and another attempt at the hard fork will occur on December 28, but I have my doubts.

When you “leave bitcoin on exchange”, there’s no Bitcoin address with your specific balance in it. There’s just the exchange’s addresses and, from that, they will pay BTC to an address of your choosing as part of you withdrawing your BTC. To support all the forks, they would have to figure out whether or not they owed you BTC before the fork, and would have to update their systems to support each fork, providing a withdrawl mechanism for each. And it gets more complicated as they may move their BTC around internally. If you know a fork is coming up and you want your cut, best to withdraw your BTC from the exchange well in advance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:27:03
Yes. Miners are selling a service with a capped supply and people transferring BTC are buying that service. When demand exceeds supply, as has been happening a lot lately, prices skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:31:59
It’s a legitimate upgrade, although the deception tactics used by (name says it all) are a bit offputting.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:18:11
Only right after you buy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:13
Hope so. I’ll buy some more if it does.

If you have BTC, soon you won't need to work.
