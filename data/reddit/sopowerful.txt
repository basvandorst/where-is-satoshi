I cringe every time I see that commercial.

Large can be consider as $3000&lt; or anything that is unusual with account spending. An example would be if you have an average monthly balance of $2000 with direct deposits from your employer for $800 bi-weekly. Then you sell you Bitcoins and receive a $4,000 deposit. That would be flagged as unusual.
If you are consistently buying and selling Bitcoins, you probably had the 'request for more information' asked previously, and then the bank would not flag your account again. As long as the information you provided is consistent.
Edit: Wording

Yes, nice catch! I just found that out [here](

'Big Brother' wants to know where you're getting your money from for you know.... taxes and stuff. ;)

I explained "large" above in another comment.
Frequent doesn't really matter. The more consistent you are after providing the additional info (if the bank requested it) the less likely they'll  put a hold on your bank account.

True, but I would say depending on the type of information. I was questioning how accurate it still was when I posted, but I assume that they would keep that standard if not improve it. A system would have a higher viscosity to change than the price of bitcoin.

Ahhh, I read your comment too fast and missed that part of doing trades at the bank. I get what you mean. However, the person you are trading with would not go to the bank with you to verify the bills if they are knowingly giving you counterfeits. In that case, they would just walk up and leave the deal which you would be at no loss.

Let's cut this one short.

In all essence though, if you do come across a counterfeit bill, don't expect your bank to replace it for you. Just an FYI. :)

Thanks for spreading the holiday spirit to others!
Edit: I would tip you OP, but I'm still waiting for my Coinbase purchase to come through. :) If I remember, I will be back!

You'd be surprised how many people out there aren't the brightest bulb...

I emailed you guys applying for customer operations position. I am still available if you guys need help.  ;)

Bank Supervisor here; if you you were to bring counterfeit notes to the bank, the teller would take them from you and NOT give you real bills back. You would have to take the loss.

Banker here; you would need 51% of the bill AND the entire serial number on that 51%.
@_date: 2013-12-27 07:22:08
On US currency, the serial is in two different places. It is diagonal from each other opposite corners. Theoretically, you can't get 51% without getting an entire serial number. 
I would link you an image example,  but I'm on mobile.
