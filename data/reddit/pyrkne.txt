And I thought the concept of Bitcoin was straight out of Cryptonomicon...
This is even more so.
@_date: 2012-10-25 21:55:09
Is that a lot? Do you mind giving a frame of reference?
Very interesting by the way.
@_date: 2012-09-04 20:36:06
Well, he didn't say it was impossible.
He said the future could have more cool stuff if people are payed to make more cool stuff.
@_date: 2012-09-08 08:56:52
I wouldn't call that "luck."
@_date: 2012-09-18 02:19:13
That's a pretty good summary.
@_date: 2012-09-17 22:25:39
I'm not going to get into the economics of it, but BFL has a lot to gain from the success of their SC line.
If and when the SC line is received by customers, it will be a huge boon to the BFL brand. They could keep all their ASIC miners for themselves, sure. But they want to sell more products in the future.

Looks like the web server is back up, but I don't think I can yet log in.
@_date: 2012-10-08 08:21:51
It affected it in at least one way. If someone wanted to buy assets on GLBSE, they needed bitcoins. With GLBSE gone, that demand is gone too.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:10
If you're a newb and have only been around a few weeks, then it probably "lost credibility."
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:45:58
I agree, the price is extra volatile because of the extreme lag. It looks like an opportunity from a chart perspective. Trading practically, on the other hand...
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:14:23
I remember the August dip. As I recall, it was triggered by / coincided with the "Pirate" fiasco, right?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:32:58


You can say that all you want. I agree, Gox needs to shape up and the sooner the better.
But doom the currency? How long have you been following this stuff, anyways?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:08:36


@_date: 2013-04-10 22:26:42


This is a really fascinating question.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:06:45
What you've described is a market, not a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:03:12
I'm pretty sure that "free" markets are capable of "freely" regulating themselves.
Why are you so scared of that?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:20:31
If you're that comfortable trading, the advice was probably not for you but for the ever-increasing noobs.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:17
I don't think he wants to listen to your "reasons."
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:58:29
Crazy! =]
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:41:36
I totally agree with you, but it's comforting trading on the "big" exchange.
Well, until it's *too* big.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:05:43
We were all new once, but of course a lot of us had the sense to shut up and listen.
This is... changing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:13:08
You might call it a soapbox, but it reads more like hard-earned life wisdom.
Your project is a great inspiration for many reasons. That aside, it is a superb demonstration of the utility of bitcoin - we can donate to your work and be completely free from transaction costs.
Anyways have a good day!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:13:18
My guess is that it will almost certainly NOT affect difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:06:39
For one, I might move somewhere far and then want to donate to a local charity "back home."
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:20:31


Interesting. It sounds almost as though we're too focused on *if* Bitcoin is experiencing a bubble, and not focused enough on what might happen after the bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-19 21:33:28
Look suspiciously like other pastebin "site hack" posts.
I'm not sure, but I think I saw one from MtGox 2011? Looked a lot like that file anyways.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:23:47
I've given my information to everyone except Dwolla, and no calls of any sort.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:56:53
I agree. While it might seem like slowing down trading stabilizes the price, it probably hurts it more. It isn't easy to get bids onto the market with the 4000 second lag we saw today.
By the way, was that record lag? It seems higher than the other mtgox attacks...
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:10:23
That's only if they needed to cash out to USD right now, and you know it.
No need to play dumb. The trend might be creeping, but it's creeping up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:02:36
You're being too hard on yourself, unless you planned to transfer to USD today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:14:44
You have a good point.
And with any luck, the coinbase rolling limit will go away and this will be super easy to do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:01:58
I too doubt anyone "lives by" a single chart.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:00:59
Heh, he is talking about the usefulness of bitcoin as a protocol and system.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:33:13
I liked the "article" - that is, the part of it that I could read for free.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:29:10
Not me. I have a long-running interest in cryptography as well as peer-to-peer applications - you can imagine how that fits Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:12:54
The author, Heidi Moore, gets paid to troll on the internet.
I gotta rethink my career choices...
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:01:34
Bro mad he got called out.
Bro mad.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:07:24
Interesting... upvote for entertaining detective work.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:27:38
Also, if you want to rip off a credit company, food is hard to sell. Bitcoin is pretty easy to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:18:17


Not just the big money players - I can only afford to buy a little, once in awhile. But that doesn't stop me from taking advantage of things like this. today I managed to buy some and some for a friend. His I bought at around $154 or so.
Whoever sold me their coins at $154 dollars can't be that happy, can they?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:52:22
That depends. You are right in that there is a convenience risk with the free transactions.
Most of them confirm quickly. I've never had a free transaction take ages to confirm, but I did recently send a transaction with a below average fee (0.0001 or so). That transaction took nearly a day to get into a block.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:32:55


@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:53


You say that, and I wonder what you mean.
I've sent dozens of no-fee transactions in the past. It's a good deal compared to traditional fee systems.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:55:06
I 'spose the concept of risk vs. return is lost on you.
You can call it half the value all you want. All I see is the price low is the high from 10 days ago.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:06:16
This is a good point, something I've felt with all the "debt success stories."
I have some student loan debt still. I'd be as happy as the next guy to pay it off with bitcoin profits - but those speculation stories still make me feel uncomfortable.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:30:59
I agree that HFT probably has its place.
Some prioritization would be nice though - with the current infrastructure, normal users like us have to wait for the bot party to die down.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:41:37
That was... a pretty bad article.
I had hoped that referencing "Harlem Shake" in the title was a simple attention grab.
Although I did smile at the "hackers" writing "secret algorithms" to release the bitcoins. Secretly, of course.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:21:39
Anyone have any idea what's going on?
Is it temporary or what?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:16:17
It's only despair if you need the cash before the price comes back up!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:29:18
The prices over the past few weeks look like a tug-of-war.
Organic growth vs. speculation.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:36:22
I agree, they would clearly be scammers if they clearly scammed us.
@_date: 2013-06-01 07:58:25


That's pretty much been the story all along.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:49:35
$110 - the new zero
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:27:31
I agree. A more widespread understanding of market economics would be great for trading behavior as a whole.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:29:59


This is a really good point. I wonder what the best policy would be?
Maybe converting a portion of the received coins into USD upon receiving. Whether the portion is 5% or 95%, it would probably simplify things to decide on a simple hedging policy and stick with it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:17:41


Oh. So you're new here then?
Explains a bit.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:03:09
Nice link, OP!
I set it up really easily.
