As far I can tell, the TD Visa Debit cards work too and they shouldn't charge you any fees because that's the whole point of them offering the Visa debit.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:03:39
Circle does work if you have a credit card issued by a major bank. I tried using my td visa credit card and it worked. Although the limits are a bit low, it's good enough for those who need some btc quick to make a purchase. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:49:35
There is truth to this to a certain degree.

Amazing artwork here, I wouldn't mind hanging some of these on my wall. Thank you for sharing. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 11:33:03
This fucking piece of shit. It seems like everyone who "makes it big" in crypto end up using it to fuck everyone else over to benefit themselves. So fucking tired of this. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:59:32
There probably aren't even any miners, just your btc going into their own pockets. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:39:26
Some of these designs are pretty cool especially the space weed one. Might buy something when I have a better look tomorrow just because you got Bitcoin added :)

Adoption so widespread we evolve into the Bitcoin symbols
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:45:54
chances are that the guy isn't dead and this is just another elaborate exit scam smoke screen 
the last time i withdrew funds from that exchange was almost a year ago and they were already showing signs of liquidity issues then. Shutting off all traditional withdraw options such as bank transfer and wire transfer, forcing people to deposit through a sketchy financial institution that isn't even located in the same country, etc. I think this was all planned and the plan was set in motion some time during the start of the last bull run.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:04:49
Forgive me but I've never heard of you guys before and I would definitely expect any mixer service to make my btc untraceable back to me if I were to use one. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:38:29
i dont know about easily but I do see this coming true some time in the future.
gold is just outdated and most newer generation will not see it as a viable asset to invest in.
what is more likely to happen is that gold may fall in value over the course of the next decade or so while bitcoin's market cap slowly surpasses it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:34:58
Possibly in our lifetimes, maybe near the end of our lifetimes. Technology is advancing so exponentially fast these days I wouldnt be surprised if crypto, or some form of it eventually replaces the outdated fiat system the world still operates on currently. While it may be difficult to see crypto as the primary method of exchanging value, I also have a hard time seeing the current fiat system surviving and functioning in 50 to 60+ years time.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:42:59
man, you're a douche
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:01:33
Depends how well you obscure your wallet transactions and addresses. But ultimately everything is trackable unless your coins go through some sort of mixing either through a service or sometimes through an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:38:03

@_date: 2019-04-14 05:21:31
Same. Lose your phone? Youkse your ID, access toy uor money and accounts and so lose access to your car and or house? And then whoever has the phone may be able to break into your car or house?? This is why I've never been a fan of the whole smart tech movement. The convenience is nice, sure, but I think these security flaws can be exploited rather easily. Tell me if my views are flawed.
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:43:13
Do you guys think amazon will ever accept crypto?

No I stopped reading at the topic title
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:26:13
This is a huge clickbait
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:46:04
no, which is why i asked what they're significance is to the crypto space outside of the fact that they're deciding to accept crypto now because patreon decided to butt fuck them
@_date: 2018-11-03 00:28:45
yes, as is with all things in life
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:41:46
I like how these people are finally opening up to crypto once they've run out of options. Also, never heard of these guys before. Not sure why they're suddenly becoming so important?
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:32:11
i agree with you but just parroting that same phrase isn't really helping anyone. a lot of people who have coins on exchange is because they're actively trading. other than trading on a DEX which usually has much lower liquidity i dont see any other option for these people but to accept that level of risk.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:51:02


this is the big picture. however, unfortunately, I don't believe it's true that the majority of bitcoin holders actually share this same vision. I know it sounds bad but I don't blame them, but most people here definitely prioritise their own wealth over 'changing the world with an exciting new technology'. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:06:27
Humanity does not deserve this but yet 
we so desperately need it. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:02:42
Yeah, you're entitled to your own opinion sure but it just seems pointless. Especially for something as subjective as cars. For people who are into cars, not even just exotic cars, are because they're like a hobby or toys to them. Who are you to say what people should enjoy and how they should spend their money if it satisfies them? 
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:52:13
Fuck yo twitter

If quantum computers strong enough to crack Bitcoin keys become a reality, your Bitcoin keys will not be the first thing you'll worry about. Nor will it be the first thing hackers will want to get a hold of first. Banking and government and security related systems will likely be the first targets and then the world will probably go into chaos and massive change depending on how much damage this would do. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:38:08
This was a pretty decent co-op game

People making such large bets are likely the earliest of adopters and were lucky enough to have held on to their coins all this time. There is a small fraction of people out there who are insanely rich now and it's likely that the world doesn't even know about their wealth. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:45:33
this is so fucking retarded

lol you tool
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:29:56
Agreed, it wouldn't be worth it at that point. Better to just buy a trezor or ledger 
@_date: 2017-09-10 02:24:54
Yes ransomers tend to do that. Ask for an amount that is significant to them but may not be for the ransomee

Btcpay is very easy to integrate if you're already using bitpay
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:23:59

@_date: 2015-02-07 21:02:18
I seem to be pretty lucky. My TD visa credit works and both my TD and Scotia visa debit cards both work on circle.com. It's an easy way for me to buy btc when I need it asap. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 09:08:33
Is this open source? 
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:06:43
I think paying for things in btc in general is a lot better than traditional fiat and card payment methods. For me it is simply the fastest and easiest way to check out. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:50:17

If i had that much money being withheld from me I wouldn't even be on reddit anymore. I'd probably be on a plane and at the front lobby of their headquarters... like 2 months ago.
