coinbase =( But never withdrawn yet. Only sent to
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:30:07
So we could say trumps election lead to the rise of bitcoin and potentially one of the most economically changing technologically advancements in human history?
Shit he would be happy to take that as his win.
That or it gets turned to him being the reason because are worried about fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:29:30
Would probably be higher if bitcoin.com weren't such a scam site
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:02:42
I think where they have it, gemini, is a good business in itself. I honestly don't see a reason for them to ever withdraw. High taxes rate and everything.. They are better off holding and hoping we can buy a but with coin in the future. That's maximizing their value 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:05:23
They barely have a mouse and keyboard. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:02:27
im trying to figure this out as well
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:51
basically. more reason to hold
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:36:36
Double the profits? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:34:13
well, it still has to run through the house one more time because of amendments but still don't see why it wont go through. Even more reason for bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:10:22
and when Lightning network appears, bcash will have a sad face. Increasing block sizes doesnt mean its better. Hopefully they learn that
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:07:53
but it really is far easier to understand and use than the rest of em. I tried that japanese shit bitfly or some crap. Ugly as sin. Gemini. I just signed up and man that one is ugly as shit too. 
Gdax..so sexy but they need to remove bcrap. its an eye sore
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:12:57
well yes, there will absolutely be profit from volatility! However, i see it as a bigger picture for us who are in it right now. I didn't get in at 1k per coin, i wish i had but if they want gain from prospecting then it means they have to put skin in the game which is good for all of us.  
Hopefully there will be some way in the future to control the ability to create mass down and upturns so as to not allow the billionaires to just buy everything and create a huge upstream and then sell everything when its high to create a new buying opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:01:33
But how will that help their countries get back to working order? I'm not an economist so I just can't grasp how that would help stabilize their economies 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:34:55
Probably on the bcash train 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:57:58
You mean we should ignore king vay? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:15:46
I just wish someone hacked bitcoin.com and write a disclaimer that they are not affiliated or are the same thing as real bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:38:30
They did. Their interface is horrendous. I gave it a few mins of playing but I couldn't get into it 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:13:26
nope! No minimum! Plus if you do end up using it as a checking account, you get free atm withdrawls from any atm
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:19:21
Buffet has an investing principle that basically says he doesn't invest in companies and things he doesn't completely understand. So, with that said, I think it's pretty safe that the old man doesn't understand anything about bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:45:52
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:10
Incorrect. You meant to say, if it drops, BUY and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:55
blah. I want to try to use gemini but man Gdax is so much easier to manage around. The UI is just so sexy
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:00:33
Ledger makes you do everything on the device itself. Trezor makes you use the web for recovery. Just a tiny decrease in security, it's no big deal really. Just use whichever you like better 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:31:03
They will have fun losing money if we don't get scared and hold 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:09:00
hes just a sociopath interested in promoting only bcash by using bitcoins name and then profiting from it. Rather than promoting both coins, he usually just hates on bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:09
I don't think they care about others considering they are hiring more people. It's in their best interest to have bitcoin succeed otherwise they die too 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:00
well said!
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:09:21
well, i love what andreas does so lets hope he doesn't tap into his former self and misuse the money!
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:19:23
26th. They finally sent me a confirmation today &gt;.&lt; coming from paris..so damn far. I'm too use to amazon prime haha
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:52:03
It's why I have it too! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:13:09
wish i had known about the retailers. Ordered directly from them and its taking forever &gt;:(
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:10
Because hopefully the hodlers are keeping their shit together so the only dumpers are the big whales who are buying 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:30:11
i was just kind of hoping for some sort of site that talks about upcoming/existing icos  and kind of summarizes them rather than going through one by one. Seems like an uphill battle searching through the 1k that exist!
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:51:50
Because bch has extremely questionable practices of only being defamatory in order to raise themselves up. Their kingpin, Roger ver, owns bitcoin. Com and tricks newcomers into thinking Bcash = bitcoin.
On top of that, now look at coinbase and the new insider trading scandal. Bcash is a shit fork of bitcoin that at the moment, yes, they have smaller fees but their solution was nothing but a crappy, temporary solution. If they had the same volume of bitcoin, they too would be slow and expensive..
These are just some of the problems. There are more 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:15:05
Ditto. I'm waiting to buy more! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:15
cost average it, homie. If you have faith that it will go back up then just buy more now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:52:46
I really dislike the way they portray it... I feel like it should somehow portray the old method compared to the new and potential usability rather than seeming like a get rich quick kind of thing 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:48:03
alright..i quicky got into it. Any way to have coins we are following in one chart? Or does that bonk things up? Instead of having just a huge bitcoin chart that is hard to scale, perhaps smaller ones that follow what coin we add.. I suppose thats hard to do because youve gotta link to binance or something.
Seems rather raw but looking good !
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:37
Could very well be someone who was inspired by him years ago while it was cheap and them just passing on the love. Probably has nothing to do with current wealth 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:47:00
How'd you lose it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:30:29
Adding lanes to a highway only solves a problem temporarily. The solution is in the works but proper implementation doesn't occur over night. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:00:45
Roger ver strikes again with his nonsense. This is the only reason bcash is even getting traction. First thing people go to is a .com
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:35:39
Think he means lightning transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:40:07
its not like people dont already wait for almost the same thing, currently. Black friday, cyber monday..xmas..buy one get one half off...coupons. 
We already do it with a fiat currency and hopefully once btc reaches that level of volume, hopefully it becomes less of a thought of when to use it because it wont be going up 10% a day but rather up and down at a very stable rate
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:31:54
but what about those of us who are waiting for our ledger to come in the mail! 
Is it rather safe, for now until delivery, to keep it in coinbase and then send it over to ledger OR gdax -&gt; paper wallet -&gt; ledger.
I just dont wanna pay all them satoshis when the ledger comes!
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:12:12
yeah...expect to wait a few days. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:33
people selling their BTC to buy BCH then while its high and btc low, restock on btc by selling their bch on a high
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:58:09
How do we even collect this free money? I've got no idea how forks work 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:10:25
another ver victim. Thinks bitcoin = bcrap
This is whats halting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:23:51
I just think they aren't quitters!
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:14:04
Look at the rise in alt coins. They simply use the leverage they've made in bitcoin to have a higher value to put into their altcoins. 
Basically speculation of an alt coin exploding and make crazy gains. It will stop again
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:05:11
I think where they have it, gemini, is a good business in itself. I honestly don't see a reason for them to ever withdraw. High taxes rate and everything.. They are better off holding and hoping we can buy a but with coin in the future. That's maximizing their value 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:54
The theory is to wait for them to get in the game. Will it pay off? We don't know. It may or it may bite you in the ass and have to buy in at a higher price 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:47:39
That's why literal monkeys have beaten most of his stock picks. Dude is a clown 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:33
Huh? I'm in NY using coinbase.. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:14:07
well, whats a lot? haha. I've done 20ish or so this year..which I suppose can be a lot for some but nothing for others. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:24:16
I'm all bitcoin but as a company, I can't blame him for adding bcrap. They are out to make money, not pick sides. Its up to bitcoin to show why it's the real deal from here on out
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:55:22
I see it as an opportunity for bitcoin to soar even more. Makes it more legitimate. People fucking up speculation purchases are gonna get burnt and those who hodlers will profit off them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:58:55
probably because most people, including the ones here, cant afford a full coin so they want something that has the potential to break out to maximize profits. 
Alt coins are indeed going to crush it next year too but i think bitcoin will still be king. Perhaps not 10000% return like some altcoins but definitely significant.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:30:34
Not directly but people think they can which is pumping the price for people waiting on them joining the frenzy 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:08:12
how do we even go about collecting our free coin from forks?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:52:22
be smart. Go to coinbase and sign up BUT THEN go to gdax (coinbase owns them) and link your coinbase to them. Learn how to buy via limit orders so you dont pay any market fees. Enjoy the chart and the ride!
Play through the options for a little bit, learn how to deposit and withdraw. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:46
well, i dont know how much you put in. But if its a few hundred then fuck it and just hold. If its a few thousand and will affect your livelyhood then you have to talk to your internal self about the pros and cons of all the scenarios. 
Panic selling is exactly whats causing what youre seeing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:47:10
What I hate is waiting for my fckin ledger to arrive. I'm so paranoid about keeping funds in Coinbase until it comes But i dont want to send it to a paper wallet until it comes because i'm a cheap bastard and dont want to pay a fee to transfer paper -&gt; ledger
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:29:53
Its like 50 away. Ho lee shit. Crazy 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:21:14
Probably tired of people complaining about the time delays and the sort 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:29:49
Would you recommend a paper wallet or something else? My ledger is still being delivered so ive got my stuff on coinbase and im feeling uneasy
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:21:20
is there a resource where we could read up on the alt coins? Been looking into some but they seem rather scammy
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:20
He was kidding hah. Roger ver and his greedy minions. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:14:53
they cant just take peoples BTC. It doesn't just magically get removed outta current owners pockets unless people also sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:01:05
The one everyone uses 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:00:59
hey dont hate! When i go to bed i leave a limit order and hope i wake up with a sweet prize
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:20:38
okay..and after?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:54:05
sorry, im not very good at elaborating. But, take those 4 charts and put em inside one. Each line being their own thing and following either usd or btc value.
So instead of having four like you've got, just having one. Although that you did doesn't look too bad!
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:40:28
Scared the shit out of me. I took it as gdax being hacked. Almost shit myself since I'm still waiting on my hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:20:52
Careful because they won't refund you in bc
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:16:22
That's their problem. They would be better off having it for later but if they wanna be bc broke, better for the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:52:47
they should probably work on getting people their deposits instead of having no money to buy coin until it clears on their end...
fast to take it outta our accounts but slow to let us use it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:25:26
Your computer with your key? Coinbase? What account? Not being very specific 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:56:57
Hmmm. Dunno! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:12:21
it happens because people like the highs and use it to leverage into other alt coins which flop like pancakes. 
Just look at the dude with the 18 week test or whatever it is. Had he kept all the money into bitcoin, he'd be winning way more than his spread
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:35:29
It will. Relax. Gdax pays a good transaction fee and even if it doesn't come in an instant, it will get there. Do a test send first (a few btc) to make sure you've set up your ledger properly. Once you see your first test send, feel free to chunk send after.
And don't be like me all scared when you see ledger give it different deposit keys. They are all linked to your private 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:10
They should keep drinking the juice because this is fun 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:21:49
Just wait for lightning network. 
Bitcoin has huge volume hence the fees.  Give it time and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:47:11
Exactly why it will go back to normal. Bitcoin just has to survive the pounding at the cost of probably the bcash whales. Once they give up, bcash loses and bitcoin goes back to how it was 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:32:33
dont see why it would. But call to ask?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:02
problem is none of us here know what will happen. Will you kick yourself if it goes back up? Yeah, of course. But if it keeps going down? You will thank yourself. 
You choose my man. Tis a rough hodl life we live!
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:33:30
yeah i didn't understand any of that either lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:46
The only thing banks can do is create a sell scare. If people hold, banks lose and just increase the price of bitcoin.
All of us holding fucks the banks for thinking they can manipulate us. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:04:23
We've just gotta hope everyone is hodl so they put their money in and don't cause a frantic sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:52:50
This is why bitcoin needs to really step their game up. I agree that their fees and speed are getting worse and are in danger 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:09:03
The next thing that needs to happen, which really ticks me off is bitcoin.com.
While this stupid fucking bcash page exists, a huge amount of traction will be lost because the first thing newcomers will do is type in  .com 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:48:42
my bank doesn't complain - Charles schwab investor checking acc
Dunno the fees in other accounts but sending wires costs 25 flat. I'm sure there are other, better ones but its simple and painless and no threats like BoA
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:22:01
uh...yeah if only i had .02. 
More like 1.2
I'm not OP heh
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:13
Stop being a pussy but also, why would you burn what you can't afford to lose? Poor mistake with the potential for complete misery 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:43:51
Yes but still doesn't fix how people then take up salaries or anything. Working or accepting bitcoin only? I suppose it could be viable but the one thing that's funny sounding is say - an apple cost  .000023 coin. It's such a funny and long ass number instead of just two 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:11:34
Yeah I figured they were just paying it forward! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:30:59
That's the appropriate attitude. Wish more people were like this 
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:38:40
Because people are idiots. Think that about sums it up 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:56:58
i have an individual one. Didnt think you were looking for a business 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:50:24
This is sick. I want 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:01:59
Just walk on over to Spain 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:27
hold on for dear life. the bitcoin holder motto
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:08:56
yep. i'm aware of all this. I saw a guide and saved it not too long ago. Waiting for the deposit to come in is what i was saying since its not instant but takes a few days before you can use the money
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:39
Seems like he wants to ride on the name bitcoin as a means to bump his bcash. He's a big baby 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:56
this is fun to watch :p
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:57
sooo youre saying coinbase/gdax isn't affected. right on. to the moon!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:56
lucky mofo!!! Dang wiring of my monies is taking far too long. I'm missing the fun
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:13
I just cant grasp why people are fear selling. Blows my mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:42
they all went down..so..thats a silly reason to get mad. should use using gdax anyway :p
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:45:28
oh god i signed up...what a piece of junk. The interface is gross and so clunky. Gdax is way better imo
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:24:41
Lower fee as in no fees if you use a limit buy
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:41:57
It's what everyone is ignoring! This is why I didn't buy it with credit or debit. I'm not buying 100. More like 1k
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:03
they were on that shit fast!! Damn. But what they fail to release is that it's almost recovered...within 10 mins
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:35:37
its the cooler looking but a little more difficult to use than coinbase exchange. It's basically the backbone of coinbase and where they get their values before you press the buy.
Coinbase owns gdax
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:21
i think the best part of this is how much trouble we were having breaking 10k. But now the 10k is like a little hiccup we easily fly over
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:37:48
Mycelium has pretty cheap prices that you can actually juggle around. You can choose a priority and will get charged accordingly
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:34:40
I know what you're saying but perhaps its just such a tradition that it seems safe.  But until btc becomes a little more stable then its hard to want to go more than 20% net worth in
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:07
and just like that its almost back up to 10k. Youre a lucky piece of shit! HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:21
unless they had a sell order ready for a huge dip to rebuy on a low...Mistake on their ends
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:04:40
As long as it doesn't move! I want in at 9k ;p
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:40:49
would be nice if they could let me have the money I wired to them ... 36+ hours ago, come through. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:29:32
last time i fucked with the irs i owed 30k. Not gonna do it again &gt;.&lt; But haven't pulled money out of crypto yet and hopefully wont have to in the future!
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:37:00
i wired to them earlier today...way before banking hours and no dice= ( I missed the huge dip as it happened and was very sad about it
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:07:14
touche. haven't checked the back end! ill see when i get there in 30ish years
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:54:47
just consider the volume of trading and who is holding. Compared to the world market, the volume is TINY. A fraction of a percent. 
If/when bitcoin becomes more mainstream, more people will want in. This is purely speculation but once volume increases, legitimacy increases and further investment volume occurs. 
We can only assume that big banks have two options. One is to inflate the price or kill the currency somehow. Either way, they have to dive in with money. Globalization should hopefully help.
I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket but it's okay to diversify. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:51:32
Well, i use both their brokerage for ira and personal. Their target retirement fund is also a tiny fraction. But as far as managed funds go then yeah, i agree with you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:51:35
problem is how long the damn transaction takes! I hate waiting when i know there may be a perfect dip to jump on . dont wanna miss the opportunities
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:57:52
Yeah he didn't have to trigger him toward the end but he definitely needed a few more points or at least enough to get the bigger point across about riding the bitcoin name.
Trying to confuse investors and misleading into thinking bcash = bitcoin for his own profit is no bueno.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:15:06
Good man! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:33:02
not the best advice as far as wallet goes. Never trust a 3rd party to hold your keys. 
Also, i don't know if its sound advice to tell him to avoid btc because he doesnt have thousands of dollars and advising lower cost coin. I mean, unless btc is dying and for sure eth/ripple/lite are gonna replace then i think its okay to diversify.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:28:04
This is why u like mycelium. Let's you pick the speed and cost 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:11
I've taken out a nice sum and gone into it but I cant go yolo on bitcoin. Some sorta security is nice
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:18
they dont tho. I use vanguard index funds and their percentages are like .01%-.05% so...what youre saying is more than wrong
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:06
cost average!. Solid 9k
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:14
im waiting for my moolah to clear. Was hoping for this to happen right as it came in. GOnna put in some low limit orders :p
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:56
yeah. i just did a wire transfer because fuck it. id rather 35 than wait a whole week like my last transfer, which is still pending. Time value of money
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:46:46
naw. been wanting to set a limit buy @ 9k since this morning. I was so ready. Lots of ppls limit buys went through since it was set before the dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:10
yeah did. I did get in a cheap eth buy  tho. Was nice

No. They sell BTC to buy into BCH. From there, they maximize from the split. Then once they have access, they sell all their garbage coin and either buy into alts or back into BTC, whichever seems more profitable.

There are just certain thing that greed supercedes morality. The socialist programs we are looking to implement affect the greedy negative. Take the narrative as you'd like but as prosperous as a country we already are, these programs are better for the people. Yes, the big companies will cry but better this happen now than later.
The move would pave a way to a better economic in terms of alternative energy, drug research, etc. There will be plenty of money to be made and the government won't be hoarding it. But, we have to "trust" that at the government level, they do right. This is the problem that most have. 
We don't like paying taxes. We don't like knowing the gov is in control of particular parts of the economy but we just have to deal with it. 
We aren't going full socialism and many, including myself, would find that fiscally irresponsible. 
We aren't cuba or going in that direction. We don't have an economy that relies on over 90% of our income. We aren't making doctor get paid the same as a street sweep cleaner. We are complicated as shit but not changing now will literally bankrupt people (causing them to rely on the gov more). We are literally killing the next generations to come and costing us more money due to climate change. The list goes on and on.

The bigger problem with the fluctuation is at what point  does it stabilize. How could they request x amount of btc if the prices are going crazy. It's insanely volatile for that kind of thing yet

I hope you're joking.. Literally every scandanavian country.. Most of western Europe. Their socialism level is very high but of course they didn't go all in.

Here's the funny thing.. You're the one falling for media hype. I appreciate that you looked into all the metrics but they don't explain everything in black and white. I've lived in Japan and France and their health care system, on a basic level, smashes ours. Granted, I never had anything serious. However, I know I wouldn't have had to declare bankruptcy because I knew my shit was covered.
As far as everything else, you have to recognize that our economy is massive. Those goods would remain close to, if not, the same levels. The only fundementsl changes that would change some costs would be medical.
How we tackle that massive thing is the true hurdle. Nobody is nationalizing car industries, metals, fuels, nothing.
I'd glaaadly pay a few hundred bucks extra a year in taxes if I knew I would be covered. I got a fucking finger infection 3 months ago  and had minor surgery in it. Medical bill for an hour of chopping some junk off? $12,000 - not counting the post consultations. That's an expensive cuticle infection. And that's a damn finger. Imagine a leg.. An arm.. Etc. 
I'm lucky I had insurance. However I still had to pay out of pocket for the deductible. That shit makes no sense and it's absurd.
This is just health care. Some gov control is fine. We are at the age where we can't be as selfish. Making money is great but at what cost? Time to remove that selfish gene even a little. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic but we have to be.

I don't know how to quote individual sections like you are hah. So, apologies for all my weak replies as I can't clearly outline what I'd like to say.
But for the first point on what I paid vs what I was charged, I'm saying that yeah I only paid 1k but what if I didn't have insurance. I'd be out 12, correct? I'm sure it could've been reduced but I don't imagine by much.
Also, as far as my friends insurances, yes, it would be weird of me to ask them for a picture of the insurances policies so I went to [Healthcare.gov](  and it seems like just from a brief glance there, the max out of pockets aren't too far off from what I was referring to. 
Also, yes medicare/caid exist but obviously right now, eligibility for it has requirements and most people who work, don't qualify. 
As far as what trumps doing, hey, that's good news. Hopefully it actually has some effect on things but I don't believe little movements like these will actually change much. It is pretty unfair though, the whole in and out of network. When he originally ran, I was totally with the whole nation out-bidding thing I think he spoke about
@_date: 2019-09-22 16:15:33
Some of the things I'm down for - education, Healthcare and climate change. However, as a landlord and someone who's active in stocks, the others kinda bug me.
Those are legitimately the only issues I want to see change. Taxing Wallstreet I'd be OK with within limits. Free housing, well that's  a whole big gaping pile of nope.
When I said we've gotta trust the gov, I meant only in some things. I wouldn't trust them with much though
@_date: 2019-09-23 11:48:03
I'm not even going to humor this anymore, especially if you're serious. It's quite the joke
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:46:12
Sometimes speculation is what helps drive innovation and economic prosperity forward. And my out of pocket, this time, was right around 1k. I'm lucky i have a REALLY good insurance though. Most of my friends out of pockets are about 5k. That's a lot of money for most folk even if they reach the max out of pocket.
I know how difficult it would be to change everything over but as I've gotten older, I realize that there are just some things i'm okay with paying extra for. Helping others afford medicals bills is the  thing I say, tax me.
Oh forgot to mention the spending thing on research. I agree with you, 100% that the US has the best research/medical tech and everything. But the cost to use facilities and get treated is outta this world, that was my main point. So for a simple procedure like mine shouldn't wreck folk.  How many never go to the doctor because they cant afford it. Those metrics aren't all available to study

There are more that have succeeded than failed, thus far, actually. Even with the inherent corruption, quality of life is far better
@_date: 2019-09-22 14:20:32
Yeah? List them and find out why they crashed. Was it due to corruption, bad economics? 99% of the time it's corruption. 
Then put your list against the successful ones that the US is more than capable of mimicking (a capitalistic socialism) , considering we already have a ton of socialist programs, and understand why they've succeeded. Does corruption exist? Yes of course and no matter which type of government however when you keep it in check, it's more than effective.
