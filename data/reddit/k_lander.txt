Also IIRC, Dubai has neither income tax nor captital gains tax so theres no worry about people using BTC to avoid paying taxes

I don't understand how having more payment options causes people to donate less. Maybe someone can explain?

I think you should create a new address for donations to the wikimedia foundation. Try and get a Vanity address like 1WikiXXXX..

Coinbase offers merchant tools: 
Maybe include a 'donate with bitcoin' button on the donation page on
in a way that dosen't confuse the user with extra choice (maybe a expandable section for other ways to pay)
or if not you could include it on the existing 'other ways to give' page.

Thanks for any bits! :D

Correct me if i'm wrong but wasn't the original goal of buttercoin to decentralize exchanges? Are you guys still working on this front?
Would you be okay with discouraging people from keeping funds on the exchange for long periods of time? Or would that work against your business model?
If you guys do store customer BTC, I hope you guys can provide proof of reserves on your exchange and have regular audits on your cold storage, that would go a long way in establishing peoples trust

"Thanks for your email and for your suggestion. We are aware of bitcoin, and we will continue to monitor it with interest. Thanks again for taking the time to email us."
