If you wrote a bot to do it, you better keep a log of each trade, because if they decide to investigate, you'll owe taxes on all your gains, offset by any losses you made.
If you're going to do this with less than pocket change, keep excellent records and get a good accountant who can make sense of it.
Or just don't pay your taxes, I don't give a shit, I'm not a cop... but don't operate under the fuckwit assumption that you don't owe anything because it's not USD in your bank account, or it's shitcoins that are probably bound for zero at some point... what matters is the actual dollar value of each at the time of the trade something out, compared the dollar value of what it was when you got it.

We won't know for sure unless Satoshi (or someone else) ever moves his coins, but I'm pretty convinced that the true market value of Bitcoin excludes his coins under the assumption they'll never move. That is, I think people who masturbate over the "market cap" by going ~$19k * number_of_coins_mined are wrong, and that if Satoshi's coin stash starts moving *lots* of people are going to instantly value Bitcoin significantly lower than they currently do.
You can't think of *anything* someone with that sort of power might be motivated by?

And what exactly do you think those are? The problem was easy access to credit meaning people were taking out loans with no equity to buy things they can't afford on the assumption the value would go up so they'd gain equity. If that's not cogent to the current situation I dunno what the fuck is.

I don't think that's correct, as that'd be about the time that I got into it... I borrowed money to buy an HD5770 and it paid for itself in very short order (after electricity costs), then continued to make more cash until mining in the summer became unbearable, then that awful time when they sat at $5 for what seemed like an eternity sucked out the rest of my interest.
That card *just* died a couple months ago, I think I can honestly say if I'd sunk $150 or whatever it cost straight into BTC, I don't think I'd still have any. Plus, we did our bit securing the network in the early days.

Because that's how it was described when many of us got into it, with the scaling question being punted down the road. It was exciting for me getting that first few Bitcoin, even though each was only worth a dollar or so, it was this ethereal asset that I traded a service for and that someone would give me cash for it in turn.
So when the goons brought up the theoretical transaction limit, and others said "don't worry, we'll have time to fix that" we fucking believed them. After MyBitcoin and numerous other scams the community shied away from letting anyone else hold this digital asset for us and now we're expected to embrace the canonical blockchain being the domain of huge entities settling up while we're forced to trust them for our day to day payments?

That's not really a genuine reflection though, because miners and node operators will still be free to specify a 1MB block limit for the foreseeable future via a configuration option on their clients.
The issue is that if we do hit that limit and it turns out to be a problem, it's a lot easier to convince 51% of miners to enable the option for large blocks than it is to hurriedly push out a patch, test it, and encourage *every single node* to upgrade when it does become an issue.

I think G+ screwed the pooch in one way when they insisted on real names. I think they've back-pedalled on YT on this, but it's too late.
There was a huge crowd of people on Twitter, IRC and other places who were excited for G+, and Google's real name policy threw a wet blanket on it. Many of these people actively promoted not using G+ in protest over the wider changes at Google services.
That's not to say they'd have necessarily dethroned facebook, but I think it was a factor. Another factor was they tried to re-implement the "exclusivity" thing because it worked so well for Gmail, ignoring the fact that it fell flat for things like Wave, and that Gmail worked with other providers whereas a social network isn't really comparable.

Well don't get me wrong, I don't hate Theymos. I think his desire to get forum software from scratch is a pipe dream that'll never pan out. I freely admit that forum software is almost universally terrible, but SA goons get by with a heavily modified vBulletin and BitcoinTalk could too. He's got enough cash in donations to license software (or pick one of the others to chop up, but I think VB or XenForo are probably the best of a pretty terrible bunch), pay someone to hack it up a bit and then probably cover hosting for the rest of Bitcoin's foreseeable future.
That doesn't make him a bad moderator, and while it's probably better that someone other than Theymos had control of this subreddit in the interests of decentralization, I honestly can't think of anyone more trustworthy.
Or for that matter, anyone better to help hold the emergency key. Considering it doesn't really buy him much that he couldn't do with a forum announcement anyway, it can't really hurt and can only help.

I don't know how the average Icelander feels about it, but isn't this what they did? They're among the few (only?) countries to not write a giant check to criminal bankers, and last I heard they were doing pretty well. The common comparison is them to Ireland (I gather because they were in similar amounts of shit) and Ireland took the US route and bailed the banks out, and Ireland's apparently doing terrible compared to Iceland.
I think failure of them to give a shit about Bitcoin (particularly when they don't want to risk capital flight at this point in their economy's recovery) isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's certainly not indicative they're "techno-phobe".

Australia is actually a pretty poor example of that, because of the higher tax rate and the foreign tax credit. I would hazard a guess that in probably 99% of cases, if you're an American living in Australia for over one tax year and you think you owe the US federal taxes, you need a better tax attorney.
If you were to live in a country that has a lower tax rate, you would have some semblance of a point, but you'd actually only be effectively paying taxes at the rates as of you were in the US (not "double").
The ultimate exception though is if you were making money living in an embargoed country - then you absolutely pay double taxes. There are a few other minor exceptions, I don't recall them I just know they don't apply to my wife.
It's still a pain in the arse what with any account with my wife's name on it and more than ten grand in it needing reporting though.

MtGox "lost" almost that many Bitcoins, FWIW. :P
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:39:18
What's closer to relevant is what about the coins that were stolen very recently when we were at about ~$600. Because if you pretend that they were all stolen before the peak of $1240, then that means that on the day of the $1240 peak, MtGox's books were out of whack to the tune of $923,065,920. That is an awful big number to not know that something doesn't add up, regardless of if the Bitcoins stolen were all $20 ones.
If you concede that they're all stolen very recently, then the number is only half as big (and thus a giant exaggeration) but it's still a pretty fuckin' huge discrepancy in your company's books. Console yourself with the knowledge that no one who ever laid eyes on MtGox's books should ever be employed in business ever again.

It doesn't force people to host shit. Forwarding things is pretty much an ISP's job.


You already pay for the capacity when you pay your ISP. They sold it to you because faster megarbitz and now you want to use what they offered, they cry poor because someone is "using capacity and doesn't pay". What planet do you live on?
The fact is that most ISPs oversold their networks based on assumptions about usage that are now outdated. Rather than update their networks for the 21st century, they fight in court for the right to double-dip on the bigger content. Their ability to do this will remove one of the primary functions of the internet - it's like taking Bitcoin and removing some of it's fungibility, you pretty much throw away the usefulness of the entire project.
The "real solution" is for ISPs to sell links that they can actually afford to provide if people utilize them as advertised. They don't do that, because that's not actually what this argument is about - note that all the companies that fight network neutrality have a vested interest in TV.

You do realize if we were still using nothing but gold coins, "natural deflation" is not necessarily a given?
You were talking earlier about the average family needing two incomes, blah blah blah, and then you switch to "holders of the currency". Anyone holding enough currency for inflation to be the primary financial woe in their lives is not a two-income, struggling to make ends meet sort of family.

This is grossly understating the worst danger (at this time) to a pool controlling 51% of the network - the attractiveness of compromising the pool operator. 
We can all agree that at this point, the NSA's budget is likely not big enough for an active attack on Bitcoin by buying mining hardware. 
How many people are convinced that the NSA's budget isn't bigger than any given pool operator's buy out price? Don't be coy about it, everyone fucking has one. If you were a pool operator and some government agency offered you a giant stack of bullion and expenses paid one way trip anywhere you wanted, would you honestly stick to your principles?

The only deciding factor would be whether said government agency is actually motivated to do it, the question of pool operator ethics is answered at that point.

Yeah I don't know where he gets 2% from. It's 0.5% at ALDI, and they're the only place I can think of that's a brick+mortar place that charges a surcharge. 
Telephone companies and shit will charge you through the nose for paying with a credit card though - I think Telstra charges something like $3 on a $100 bill?
Comparing Bitcoin to credit cards in Australia isn't really an apples-to-apples comparison though, because BPay is infinitely better than cards for things like that. I just wish more places would put the BPay QR code stuff on their bills.

On what planet is this true? Look, I think it's awesome you're brave enough to play the contrarian on this discussion, but I think you're wrong here.
"Net neutrality" is about forcing Internet Service Providers to provide **internet** service. That means all of it. Part of the reason they should have common carrier immunity is because they should act like common carriers.
When they're whining and crying poor about Netflix and torrents shredding their bandwidth and pushing up utilization, here's the problem I have: For over a decade now, "broadband" in the two countries I've been living in has more or less stagnated. They market this shit as "X times faster than dialup" and then cry poor if you try and use it. Don't sell people a 60mbps connection if you can't afford for them to use it! Don't sell me a 500GB bandwidth cap if you can't afford for me to saturate it in the evenings watching netflix.
While you do have a point with your final paragraph, I think your initial statement misses the mark by a long shot. I'm also not entirely convinced that network neutrality will lead to monopolies.

Good luck to 'em. The BSD folks get along pretty well with this model (folks like Apple contribute a lot back to BSD groups even though they don't have to), though even if you put them all together they're nowhere near as popular as Linux.
It's basically the perfect software license equivalent for the majority opinion in this sub. BSD contributions are basically the one example of companies doing something charitable because it's actually in their best interests.
The BSD and MIT licenses are my favorites because they're simple and you don't need a lawyer to fully comprehend your responsibilities - you can concentrate on coding.

You're almost right.
Pool operators can include data in blocks they mine - Luke did this at Eligius at caused a minor stir by putting catholic text into his blocks for a while.
You don't need random data to push arbitrary data to the blockchain, you just need to be willing to burn BTC to do it. There are huge numbers of strings buried in the blockchain by people who just turned those strings into Bitcoin addresses and sent BTC to them (that BTC is now lost forever due to the almost-impossible odds of ever generating a private key for that address by accident).
Finally your PC will last a little bit longer executing /dev/urandom if you pipe it to perl first.

Isn't that arguing against your point? Consumers very obviously don't follow merchants if they can't even get people to quit using cash? 


Right, but the credit card industry has made a tidy little market for itself by making that not the consumer's problem. Since the argument was about why consumers should use it, that's pretty important. 


Fair point, but the point above is simply that consumers aren't perfect, and since the current banking system makes it so you're not liable when you fuck up, albeit at a premium on prices, **why should the average consumer use Bitcoin?** That's the question that needs to be asked and answered if Bitcoin is going to go anywhere but a minor niche.

"It will make you rich" or the weaker "it won't lose you a tiny prevent per year if you leave it under your mattress" shouldn't really be Bitcoins strongest selling point. And I don't really think it is. I dabble in Bitcoin because it is neat - an almost frictionless way to send "money" around the globe as easy as down the street.
The fact it needs a value and that that value needs to come from people buying it, and that *that* desire needs to be motivated by the ability to profit is simply a constraint of the problem. It's not desirable in any way.

Ripple has a lot of neat stuff in it. If someone figures out a way to make it work without XRP-style "stamps", it'd be amazing. Even if it didn't entirely work, it was something new and different instead of Bitcoin fork with a regex over it and a few minor code changes. Since the advent of Bitcoin, everyone has gone back to thinking that a blockchain is the only solution to every problem. No bones about it, blockchain and proof-of-work **is a fucking terrible solution** but we use it because so far it's the only one that works. Don't stop looking for a better one.

Stop talking and go read a crypto book.
a) Rainbow tables aren't what you think they are.
b) How will salting+hashing client side work with the server still able to verify the hash, that doesn't throw away the usefulness of the salt?
c) Name a fortune 500 company that does client-side hashing before sending the passwords?
At some point in their life, I guess lots of people who muck about with password transmission think client side hashing is a good idea. It normally doesn't last very long. HTTPS gets the job done, and protecting your password from the server being compromised is basically keeping the bathwater clean at the expense of the baby.

How can you expect to have a rational conversation when you're forgetting that some people just economically disagree with Bitcoin?
I think the distribution model is stupid, I think the idea of increased scarcity is idiotic. I realize that these things are required to make it work, but I view them as flaws, not features.
I entirely understand that some folks out there may feel similarly, but just feel that the potential benefits and/or interestingness of Bitcoin do not outweigh those flaws.

I don't really think so though.
One minute is still too long for confirmation for the average in-person transaction. You're not going to use the currency if you have to sit in the drive-thru at McDonalds for one minute while your payment goes through. 
It's possible it *might* work out where you pay immediately after ordering and it confirms before your food's ready... but what about in the line at the grocery store? Customers behind you, in a country where people seethe with rage when they find out someone's paying with WIC?
But it's worse than that, because shorter blocks means more orphaned blocks. Take Dogecoin for example - the orphaned blocks are huge in numbers. What good is a "confirmation" if you can't even be reasonably assured that once your transaction is in a block it'll stay there?
You're probably better off just using a service that tries to guess the likelihood of fraud based off network propagation to attempt to minimize fraud, or restructuring the checkout process so that a five-ten minute lag isn't so critical (pick out and pay for your groceries on a website, go to a store to pick them up?).

I've had it happen, multiple times. I've taken to asking for pin-only on my credit card because I'm so terrible at signing my own signature, and I had to reconfigure my business accounts and sign the authorization form at the same time to get bank feeds working on Xero. I actually had some idiot at a Goodwill give me shit about the signature not matching even though I deliberately asked for PIN because of my difficulties with my signature.
I'm so glad australia did away with signatures for credit card transactions - it's a retarded system (not that a "secret" with 10,000 possible combinations is much better, but at least I'm not prone to fucking it up). The US will probably follow suit in about 20 years time.
Oh and when I was in the US, I knew that no one ever checked signatures so I started signing with funny messages. After reading an article here, I signed a few transactions at walmart self-checkout with "under duress" and the next few times I went in they started checking my ID and everything.

Maybe in the implementation, I suppose, but:


If you're surprised that calculating your tax burden when using Bitcoin is a "paperwork nightmare" then you've had your head in the sand.
As a Bitcoiner in the US you've basically got two choices if you want to keep using the currency:
a) Don't claim anything and hope you don't get audited. 
b) File gains paperwork and record your basis for each transaction.

If there's Malware on your PC, all bets are off. Sure, your wallet is probably encrypted, but that doesn't do anything if you decrypt it (say, to pay for something) while the malware is there. 
I specifically used the example of paying via mobile device using a QR code a) because it's quicker and easier IMHO and b) because it's slightly more secure and thus kinder to BTC in the example.


For the purposes of this particular discussion, "secured software" does not exist. There is always someone cleverer than yourself, you need to find ways to minimize the damage because avoiding it completely is futile. We have best practices, but sometimes those aren't good enough. 


I don't understand the last question, but the rest of the quoted paragraph is a flawed assumption. 2FA on CoinBase is great, you should feel safer using it - but if there's malware on the PC you use it on, all bets are off.
My point was that for an average user, from a security perspective, getting owned is almost an eventuality. At least, if you're going to make assertions about BTC being more secure. The fact is that BTC can help prevent thefts, but when they do happen you're powerless. With a credit card, when they happen they're not your problem. For the average good consumer, the latter is better.

Because, like barter and cash transactions, the US income tax system relies on voluntary reporting with auditing for suspicious cases.

"Sketchy as fuck" in that Shrem learned, a long time before the arrest, that Faiella was operating a money transmitting business, unlicensed, and even (AFAIK) learned the grisly details of it. He learned because BTCKing's clients fucked up on two deposits. The correct response on learning BTCKing was reselling would have been "okay look under this stupid law we need to see your MSB registration. you don't have one? Okay, sorry, we can't do business with you any more. Sorry it didn't work out, you were a valued client."
**Charlie would not be going to jail if he'd done this**.
His job as compliance officer was to ensure compliance, and he actively went against that job. He also actively went against his co-founders wishes to drop this suspicious client. All in the name of money. This is about greed overriding common sense.

The root cause of the issue is that there are already regulations in place to cause the monopolies. Where the libertarians have it wrong is that they (typically, if this thread and others are anything to go by) only complain against this regulation. They say "no more regulation" without backing up that position with the root cause of the problem, unless they're pressed. This is bad. This leads to a whole bunch of people thinking that the current system is fine.
There's also nothing about network neutrality that makes it harder to remove the other regulations - net neutrality could be implemented, and then all regulations together could be thrown away to enable actual competition. But no, most libertarians oppose this regulation on ideological grounds, without thinking where it will lead them (other than the foolish idea that mesh networks will replace the internet and be satisfactory for all).

He didn't actually, he suggested that you could precompute the hashes (or at least compute them faster than the link can handle) just as easy (which is different from "easier") so there's no benefit whatsoever.
There's no benefit because if you can capture the hash, you can simply retransmit the hash without even knowing the password and the server has no idea.
In short, client-side hashing is a terrible waste of time because it gives a false sense of security and contributes virtually nothing. The only people who will bother to implement it are folks who grossly misunderstand crypto and so it's likely they've fucked up the password storage in some other way.


Who cares about that though? Passwords are a terrible authentication method, but they're what we have and they're ubiquitous... but you shouldn't be sharing passwords across multiple sites. If one site gets compromised (or even if you only think that's so), you just change your password and continue with your life.
You mentioned earlier that you can't control what the user does - that's fine. But you also needn't bugger around with an extremely flimsy contraption for the questionable benefit of trying to prevent your users from shooting themselves in the foot.
Finally, where does the client store it's salt/pepper? You do realize if it doesn't pick the same salt/pepper each time then the authentication fails?
TL;DR: The only reason to use client-side crypto is for challenge response, which your scheme doesn't do.

To be fair, I would add the word "allegedly" to most of your statements, but yes, you're correct.
Furthermore I'd have to wonder how anyone actually gets caught doing this shit. If someone wants to buy your Bitcoins to cash out their stolen credit card proceeds, **why in the fuck would they tell you?** The cops will tell you, because they have to establish *mens rea* - without you knowing full well that the proceeds are stolen and receiving them anyway there is no crime and they wasted all that time and effort.
But a criminal gains absolutely nothing by telling you, they risk throwing the deal (because honestly only a scumbag finds out the money they're accepting is stolen and accepts it anyway), and they risk that the person selling the Bitcoins is actually a cop.

My point was that if the transaction has to wait for confirmations, you'll have to wait a bit anyway. One or two minutes of blocks are still too long for most transactions in person anyway.


If you aren't concerned about your transaction getting unconfirmed, then you can probably take zero confirmation payments. Confirmations mean the transaction is final, transactions that go into orphaned blocks and then aren't in the actual chain yet can still be double spent.


I don't think it would, there are already services (I think blockchain run one?) that tell you the probability of a double-spend and they aren't creating centralization.


Yes, there are lots of opportunity for good old fashioned enforcement with zero confirmation payments. It really depends on the severity of the payments - if you're running a horde of vending machines then having a service tell you that your transaction is propagated to 95% of the network I'd probably enough to spit out a soda or condom or whatever.
I just don't think one or two minute blocks help anything at all.
We aren't even discussing the idea of off chain transactions through a trusted intermediary, which is probably the most likely use case for most small transactions if Bitcoin is to scale to every day use in any sense.

They can't. All full-nodes, not just miners, enforce the rules of the protocol as well. Mining heavy-hitters can exclude transactions, and to a lesser extent roll back transactions, but that's it.
Even if you hold 90% of the mining power, if you change the rules, you simply form your own network (with blackjack, and hookers) and the "real" network's hashrate drops overnight. That's all that happens.
Not that a 90% loss of hashing power wouldn't be devastating, but they can't change the rules.

We do it instead by hacking the callback handler, but it's nasty because it causes incorrect prices in reports. Then at tax time, we've got to go along and add those transactions up (mercifully, Bitcoin transactions are a tiny percentage of our business) and adjust the reports to suit.

I feel like OP is not being completely forthcoming about the facts in this case, because without exception the buyer must go out of their way to send a payment as a gift. They also give up all their buyer protection stuff as well, so either he's asking them to do it or its scammers doing it (no one else in their right mind would do it ever) - he'd be dodging a bullet by sending money back to those folks.

Ripple might be peddling idiotic premined tokens but the rest of the system at least worked when I used it (I still haven't cared enough to look at the consensus code to see if it worked as advertised, but I suspect if it didn't we'd be hearing more about that and less of the "premine scam" we still hear).

The problem is that almost all the big players in the residential internet industry also have a huge stake in providing television. That's where this argument stems from in the first place - torrents and netflix take a huge chunk out of TV profits.
The bullshit going around that netflix doesn't pay for the capacity is complete shit. I signed a contract for 25mbps internet, as advertised. **I paid for that fucking capacity**. If you oversold it based on flawed assumptions of traffic habits, that's your issue not mine. Should have sold me 5mbps if that's what you can afford to deliver for the same price, instead of appealing to the lowest common denominator with more megabits per buck.

I didn't read the entire paper, but from the abstract it sounds to me like this is just a generic framework to do what Blockchain.info, Ripple.com, and several other websites all do with client data.
Assuming the crypto and framework hold water, this is still a huge step forward as it's almost always preferable to use a crypto library vetted by many other people than rolling your own. It basically negotiates the minefield of implementing encrypted storage for you.
I welcome being proved wrong, but I don't think this approach buys you anything that Blockchain.info et al don't already do.

I don't think that's entirely true - the real solution is to have a decentralized way to measure the growth and contraction of the economy and react accordingly. As far as I know, no such way exists, and possibly never will. 
I grudgingly accept the deflationary model of Bitcoin because it's the only way these things could have had any value to boot strap the process - the idea that they may have value in the future. It's basically the next best thing to the first paragraph. 
I think we'll end up with a very different kind of economy out of it. I don't think the Austrians will be proven right, but I'm also not convinced that that will prove fatal to Bitcoin. It's certainly going to be a grand experiment.

Face it, by the "interesting" definition of the word "criminal" in the US, the Silk Road was a criminal enterprise, and everyone participating in it was involved in some small way with the illegal stuff.

If you refuse to update, your client, and anyone who agrees, forks the network and continues a chain that keeps the current rules. This means that the developers have to be rather cautious in the changes that they make, and which is why you're unlikely to ever see changes along the line of "we'll just set it up so the block reward doesn't halve anymore" or something of that nature.
No amount of miners or other clients agreeing can force your client to change what it thinks the rules are. All that happens is that the clients abiding by the new rules go off and make their own network, with blackjack and hookers.

I was more getting at the fact that we as a society haven't really come up with a way to have distributed units of exchange without those units of exchange having value. Ie, you could have something like Ripple, where the units being exchanged (disregarding XRP) don't have any value in and of themselves, they only represent value - but how do you do that without trusting someone else?
I didn't mean to imply that Bitcoin "needs" to have value in some sense of "should", only that it's the only real way we've found to make the system work in a distributed fashion. Make something that, through a system of rules, is provably scarce, and if people consider it valuable it will be - then it's a useful method of exchange.
I think you're reading too much in to what I'm saying. What it boils down to is this: suppose in some hypothetical future we come up with a monetary system that never inflates or deflates, it simply is. Your purchasing power never goes up or down, 1 unit will always have the same amount of purchasing power (though prices for individual things and services would obviously go up and down) and you neither get rich by holding the currency nor do you have your savings whittled away over time. The money supply is controlled by some entity that is able to perfectly adjust the supply to keep overall purchasing power exactly the same.
Bitcoin is better than that how? I posit it isn't - but such a currency doesn't exist, and it may be a problem that *never* has a solution. 
I don't really give a shit what the market demands, because there's markets for all sorts of unsavoury things. The market isn't always right.

But I'm afraid I don't really see why the average American worker need give a shit, since they're on the positive side of said theft.
But if you're implying that these gains were stolen domestically, I'm afraid you'll have to do better than "look at the military, size of government" as proof. The vast majority of it, I feel, is taken by the corporate engine and wall street behind it.

My only difference would be that I feel they could make a priest or whatever a valid witness for the marriage certificate, so that they could keep it so you're legally married during the ceremony. 
But (and this is the important part) the exact same set of legal rights and responsibilities should be available to any two (and I'm not even strongly opposed to removing the limit of two, it just complicates things legally) consenting adults.

I plugged it in ages ago, and it had tick boxes on all the configuration options so I thought it was reprogrammable, but I never pulled the trigger on the off chance I eventually wanted my MtGox account. Turns out they program them with an access code, which is needed to reprogram them and is six bytes in length.
Wonder how long it would take if I connected a debugger to it and tried to brute force the six bytes? I also wonder if they're the same for everyone or a random six bytes.
I feel like an asshole, I've been repeating the idea that they're reprogrammable for ages after someone on Bitcointalk said they were. :(

I feel like there's the chance of there being people out there who would like to purchase Bitcoin, but simply don't trust or wish to use any of the current exchange processes. Buying from the US government is about as legitimate as you can get in some folks eyes (others, as evidenced by this very thread, feel the exact opposite).
But then I think about how those people would liquidate such an investment and I think that maybe there's not so much money playing for that reason.

That's framing the question though, in a massively dishonest way. He's not allegedly on trial for selling Bitcoins, the crux of the argument is whether or not his particular manner of selling Bitcoins constituted money laundering.
I watched the video again last night and personally if I was "just selling Bitcoins" I don't think I'd yell "you're a cop?!" at the other person when the cops kick the door in.
I'd really like to see the entire video, not just the parts the media showed.

Okay, I can concede that (I don't entirely agree with you, but will concede to keep the conversation on track, I'll just say that guidance isn't legally binding). But apparently (and Charlie's never, to my knowledge, denied this) he still a) knowingly went against both the wishes of his business partner/co-founder, and his payment processor, even after they made it clear they wanted nothing more to do with him and b) refused to comply with his responsibility as compliance officer by actively ignoring a client who refused to identify himself.
If you replace my statement above about MSB registration with simple identification he'd still be in the wrong.
The fact is Charlie kept taking BTCKing's money because it was green, even though he was advised many times not to, and it turned out it was a crime (regardless of the merits or injuries of that crime or lack thereof).
I am not arguing that the laws Charlie broke are moral (though I definitely think the way he went behind his business partner's back was immoral, that doesn't involve the government), I'm simply arguing that all the people masturbating to the idea that Charlie committed no crime and hurt nobody are rooted in fantasy.

It's quicker, but it's not more secure. Let's say you have a smartphone device that is used solely for BTC and nothing else. You log on to your malware infested PC, and you make two transactions - one with a credit card, and one with BTC. The malware steals your credit card details and buys some offshore seedboxes. You contact your card company and go through the pain in the arse of having to deal with getting the card replaced, but they wear the fraudulent charges.
With your BTC transaction, the malware introduces a new QR code with the attacker's address on it. You pay them instead of Overstock. They can't steal any more out of your wallet, but the money they did get is gone, you'll never see it again.
The only way it's more secure is if Overstock get owned, their customers are protected (without hideous PCI-DSS). That's certainly attractive, but for the average user a minor inconvenience of having to replace a credit card is a worthwhile trade for fraud protection.

What's that in terms of percentage of the CC market? How much BTC was lost or stolen this year, and what's that in percentage?
The fact is that there really isn't that much cost to the average consumer in using the credit card system (leaving out the unbanked, who could stand to benefit massively from Bitcoin, were it not for the fact that the types of problems that lead to westerners becoming unbanked are far more fatal in BTC) and the benefits are massive. 
Heck, BTC can lose in value in a day what my credit cards cost me a year, and I get no protection except myself.

When a new block comes in to a full node, it's checked against the rules. If it doesn't pass the rules, it's tossed away. So all the blocks from the 90% are discarded - that's how the network splits. Only 10% of the blocks will pass the rules, the rest are thrown away.
So I'm pretty sure if someone came away with 90% of the mining power and tried changing the rules, people would just tell the new set of rules to fuck off.

I'm curious as to if you've actually looked at the numbers, to see how much of the increases in productivity were "stolen" by "the elite" and how much were "stolen" by inflation?
Because I think you're massively overstating inflation's role in this argument, and when you revert back to the truth (I concede I haven't looked into the figures either, but you're the one making the bold claim) you're going to end up on the wrong side of the argument in this particular crowd.

The government, given only the power to delegate common carrier status to ISPs, will require sperate legislation to block Bitcoin (or anything really, and one may argue that once ISPs have common carrier status it's harder to ask them to block anything).

It can't possibly scale to support microtransactions - as the BTC inflation rate falls away, transaction volume or fees will have to rise or the network starts to lose hash rate.
When I pointed out that Satoshi Dice's spamming was actually a good test of the network's ability to handle microtransaction, someone with authority (can't recall who) claimed that Bitcoin will not be good at microtransactions in the future. This sucks because that's what I thought it'd be good for.
Bitcoin can still have microtransactions off-chain, even between multiple providers (say Bitpay and Coinbase) who then use on-chain transactions to settle up, but the protocol itself just can't feasibly do it in it's current form.

It's not *really* cryptographic proof he didn't sign something, but the lack of digital signatures is pretty good evidence. The onus is on OKC to provide a copy of the contract with roger's digital signature on it.

No it doesn't. It comes from what people hold as the value, which is perhaps tied to the artificial scarcity, but the value isn't tied directly to effort required to mine it.
Think about it - the fact that something took you a lot of time and effort to do doesn't inherently make it worth money. Also, the BTC that were mined in the tens of thousands on a shitty CPU years ago aren't worth any less than the 25BTC it takes a giant farm of ASICs to mine today.
Bitcoin's only "inherent value" is the ability to transport the agreed upon value in a censorship-resistant fashion - the network gives it value, the people who want it give it value. If someone comes up with a fair way to distribute new coins in a decentralized fashion, and a decentralized trust database that doesn't involve proof of work (unlikely, I think) it won't inherently be worth less than Bitcoin because there's less work involved.

Right, but that point is not entirely cogent because a) they have delivery costs associated with their CDN, which do rise with more people having copies of it and b) the actual costs of a TREZOR unit are supposed to be around the $19 mark (see elsewhere in this post), the rest is to cover sunk R&amp;D costs.
So barring the fixed $19 cost of each unit, they could half the rest of it and sell it for $69 (at which point I know I'd personally buy one just to have a toy) and they may see an increase in sales. If they got &gt;100% increase in sales, the end result would be they'd be closer to the black on their R&amp;D costs.
The real question is, would the end result be worth it? I don't think anyone can really say.

Yeah, this seems to tick pretty much none of the boxes required for identification in a day-to-day fashion. Sure, you'd get caught out if someone bothered to go look for your original documents, then compared them to the proof-of-existence in the Blockchain.
But in typical Libertarian fashion, there's no mention in the [slides]( of checking any sort of government IDs or anything else, so basically all it says is "these people (those who are signing for you in the WoT) know me as &lt;name&gt;". Which is fine, for proving who you are in the context of that web of trust. It's not fine for doing anything else where you might want identification that's limited to one per person, like, I dunno, *fucking voting*.

Yep, it's an all-round shit choice for a license for something like a Trezor.
I wonder how long their copyright lawyer looked up from having his face in an ashtray before he drunkenly suggested that license. I honestly suspect they deliberately chose the most restrictive license they could find and still claim "open source" (on arguable grounds, admittedly, I don't think it's open source at all and the absolute worst part is that any sufficiently motivated chinese company could trivially re-implement this code by their own programmers but it absolutely fucks FOSS enthusiasts who play by the rules).
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:58:57
Considering "decentralized government" is one of the things this idiotic idea is touted for, I probably could have.
Think about it, in a Bitcoin-libertarian paradise where something like this could be useful, how often would you need identification? No one cares about border crossings, you shouldn't need permission from some lame-ass government to drive a car, and Bitcoin does everything financial in a trustless fashion so no need to prove your identity there either.
If you smash into someone while driving, identification could be useful so that the person can leave the scene secure in the knowledge they'll be able to recover damages from you... but this ID is useless for that because there's no guarantee you are who the ID says you are, beyond the context of using that ID's web of trust.

With an open source license, they have nothing to sell. Companies can just take it (as we've seen).
The only thing they have to sell is *trust*, and they have to be very careful not to destroy that only asset.
Like personally, the fact that the BWallet doesn't work because the buttons are different pins creeps me out. Why did they go to that trouble? I don't think it's paranoid to wonder why they don't want you to run Trezor firmware. I don't think it's paranoid to wonder (without a device in my hands to analyze) what those other pins are doing. It could be as simple as they didn't use a direct equivalent of the microcontroller, I know precious little about embedded devices (I've mucked about with PICs and TI's MSP-430, specifically playstation modchips on the former, and only a couple days messing around on the latter) but it all comes back to my previous point... trust.
If I had enough Bitcoin to warrant keeping them securely (the amount I kept, which I spend from time to time, the security of keeping it in a BCi wallet is plenty tolerable for me), I would only buy a Trezor... even after the licensing spat.
That's what Trezor needs to trade on, as long as they can do it without FUD. Just facts.

To be clear, it's my understanding that the Trezor's bootloader isn't locked in the sense that you can't run your own firmware (correct me if I'm wrong on that). However: 
* If you run a not-signed-by-Trezor firmware, you'll get a warning every boot that it's not secure.
* I gather that going from a signed to an unsigned firmware wipes the data on the unit.

Flawed assumption here. We're not currently hitting the 1MB (though it's becoming pretty obvious we will at some point) hard limit, so why do you automatically assume that raising the 1MB hard limit twenty-fold will increase the bandwidth and quota requirements twenty-fold as well?
I'm pretty sure Gavin has stated multiple times that he will just be increasing the hard limit - miners are still able to maintain a 1MB soft limit if they like, because when we start smashing into that it's a much less cataclysmic scenario compared to something that requires a hard fork to fix.

They should have chosen a license that reflects their wishes and goals. Heck they could have used a NC license, and then selectively licensed it to groups they like the work of, keeping the discretion firmly theirs.
They traded off the LGPL then got butthurt because someone used it under the terms of the license they chose, to make a cheap knock off. Then they picked the absolute worst way possible to change the license.

The miners who want to hold it have to have the financial capacity to be able to do so, so they have to be included in the demand for new coins.

IMHO Ripple works without the currency being a store of value. I don't understand (and am at odds with) OpenCoin's plan to monetize Ripple. 
I haven't had time to work out whether the consensus thing works as advertised, but it sounds neat and there's certainly a scenario where you can imagine flinging tiny BTC transactions around between entities on a network like Ripple, then they periodically use the Blockchain proper to settle up. 
What I can't figure out is why anyone other than OC should give a shit about XRP.

But it seems to me like if you changed the PoW to try and avoid a 51% attack, and the change in PoW invalidates all/most those ASICs, you make the network weaker, not stronger, yes?

A complete and utter falsehood: with BTC (and basically any other blockchain powered currency), any group that collectively controls 51% or more of the mining power can absolutely freeze your "account" by simply declining any blocks where your outputs are spent.

Look, I think this whole BU thing is stupid as fuck, but isn't wrong (on the definition of open source, they could be wrong if they can't show that the offer to make the sources available ever happened). ~~It's irrelevant to the license that Bitcoin's released under (MIT), because they could make it closed source (even temporarily) and that's perfectly okay.~~
But if you take a common little license called the [GPL]( (~~again, I must stress, Bitcoin isn't bound by the GPL~~), in version 3 it's in section 6, bullet point b. So it's perfectly okay to call something "Open Source" if the source is only available by a CD-ROM via snail mail, because the GPL is the precedent.
Edit: Forgot that by distributing binaries built against Qt using the open source license, they are bound to abide by it. Either way, making source code available by snail mail (if that offer is indeed valid) is still OK under the GPL.

It might be going against the grain of this sub to say what I really feel about education - which is basically that an educated populace is a public good, one which I think is sufficiently good for the government to be funding it. Not living in a country filled with uneducated idiots is well worth the taxes, in my humble opinion.
Having said that though, there's lots of problems with your post, not the least of which is you don't draw a distinction between an education and a *certified* education (ie, a diploma, certificate, degree, doctorate, etc).
There has never been a time in the world where a non-certified education has been *more* accessible. You could literally walk down to your public library (assuming you're not in some third world shithole where public internet access doesn't exist), get a library card, and take courses at Khan Academy, Coursera, MIT, etc and learn a bunch.

This part isn't wrong in that it "can't ever happen", because it has already happened once. The author's flaw is in not recognizing that this has already happened once, and the following "manipulate the value" and "sell the illegitimate Bitcoins" didn't happen. In fact, Bitcoin is probably stronger for this having happened, because there's already a precedent for how people and organizations would react.

The word "anonymous" (indeed, any "anony"-word) appears in the whitepaper exactly once: in a paragraph that effectively admits that Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous, not anonymous.

My argument for scaling is nothing of the sort, it's just a report from a frustrated user - a month or two ago it took multiple tries and several days to send $50 to Steam via Bitpay, *with a 10% fee*. I'm pretty sure an international charge on my credit card would have cost less, and trouble with Steam's anti-fraud systems notwithstanding, it would have been less headaches for me.
I don't give a fuck how they solve it - and if you asked me to pick between Segwit and whatever the fuck the other clowns are peddling this time around, I'm not really qualified. But dismissing even "most" pro-scaling arguments as FUD is patently absurd.

None of this is relevant to Satoshi though - he or she would only owe capital gains taxes because most of the BTC was utterly worthless (literally) when it was mined.

No I mean, how many kWh/month you generate that are waste, what the setup cost of the miners was, etc, so that it can be compared to just selling them.
I'm assuming since the farm is off-grid, there'd be a setup cost to getting it on-grid for the purpose of selling back, so the purchase costs of the miners are less of a factor? If selling back is capped (and that's the problem), does that mean that for smaller solar installations that have waste capacity selling back might be more profitable than mining (or is it more profitable to mine all the way through)?
I thought about mining with excess solar capacity too, but in Australia we were on a ridiculously subsidised feed-in rate that even if the mining hardware was free it wasn't really worth it. Those subsidies end soon (or have ended, I haven't been paying attention), which is why I asked for some numbers.

I think the point is that if you're in control of a sizable batch of miners for Bitcoin, let's say you have 5% of the hashrate of Bitcoin among your cartel.
At any point, you could decide (not that you would, but you could) decide to attack any compatible chain that has below 10% of the hash rate of Bitcoin, and you'd instantly have 51%. Ergo, the security of those coins is already broken, right now... as the only thing stopping a group in control of 51% of a given blockchain from attacking it is they'd be destroying their own investment. If you're not invested in the chain, you don't give a shit about it, so you could easily destroy it.
The only actual protection from this is altering the hashing algorithm that those miners can't trivially convert to your chain, because otherwise your chain is provably insecure unless it's the biggest... among compatible chains, only the largest one is actually secured.

So there's a pretty good chance I'm wasting my time, but I'll try and explain it: at the moment, there's functionally no difference. I don't know whether iotaadviser's numbers are correct, but the premise is sound.
There are X new BTC per day mined. If the price is Y, that means there must be XY new value coming into the economy every day for the price to remain the same, otherwise the price goes down. 
That means that effectively, for any given block, we're paying XY/144 collectively for all transactions that's mined in that block, and the amount you pay is proportional to the value of the BTC you're currently holding. It's inflation by any name, just because it goes away eventually instead of carrying on forever doesn't suddenly make it not inflation.
When you factor in the costs of that "inflation" (or whatever you want to call it), Bitcoin isn't terribly cheap.

If you're running a business, you cover all your bases. If Paypal freezing your money can cripple your business, then you're doing business wrong.
Especially if it's only for 21 days... you should be socking every spare cent away when you boot strap a business so that you have at least 3 months' operating capital in the bank at all times (one of mine currently has 10 months, and I'm considering ceasing trading because business is too slow). You should have alternate payment processors if Paypal decides to stop taking your client's money (or, as is the case with a few of my clients, they flatly refuse to use Paypal). Then your worst case scenario is you have to call up vendors and figure out an alternate way of getting them money - no biggie, most will work with you if you give them time.
So either the business is truly "on the side", or has just started, or the business owner was bound to plough the thing into an iceberg eventually anyway, Paypal just saved them months of work.

I in no shape way or form said that if a business has just started it's bound to fail. Of course, if you started a business without adequate capital that you can't weather a tiny issue like a payment processor hiccup, you're severely hamstringing the business to begin with...
... but I never said that if a business has just started it's bound to fail.
Also keep in mind that when you said "not everyone can afford to start a business with all bases covered, much less a lot of capital to back them in case of things like this" you're basically implying that Paypal should do business with you the way you want them to, because you were unable to raise appropriate capital to start a business.

Okay, to be clear the "Paypal just saved them months of work" should have been tied to the "they were going to ruin it anyway" clause, not the other two.


**That is the fucking problem**. Your operating capital needs to live in a real bank, not a Paypal account. It takes about 30 seconds worth of Google searching when vetting Paypal (even if the vendor is a household name, you still vet them before using them with your business right?) to realize that there's no shortage of business holders who've been forced to grab their ankles because of some imaginary or otherwise slight in Paypal's eyes.
I contend again that anyone caught out by this is bound to run their business into the ground at some point or another anyway.

This is why I hate this masturbatory revolution thing that a few Bitcoiners have going on. Bitcoin won't change wealth inequality, in fact it'll likely make it worse. It won't change the money-begets-money issue that plagues capitalism. I personally think that's a flaw of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is still interesting *despite* the flaws. I concede that others won't necessarily view it as a flaw.
But whacking off to this idea that Bitcoin is going to allow the common man to rise up against the elite is just completely braindead. It kinda makes you wonder whether the author's understanding of the departure from the gold standard is braindead also.

There's actually a way to do this already, it just hasn't been done yet because we haven't really reached a point where it's necessary (just convenient) and there's more important work for the devs to be doing.
The basic idea is that you don't ever need the full transaction history, all you need is a direct route from coinbase to the last unspent transaction. Everything in between can be pruned without issue. It's not that it can't be done or no one's ever thought of it, it's just that the developers have been doing other stuff instead.

Relatively easy being... well... relative. Based on the information that's public right now, my personal guess is that someone had access to Linode's administrative section, and they sold that to someone who understood Bitcoin, and who planned this attack out quite well.
That's not, in the grand scheme of things, an "easy" attack. It's not every day a hacker owns a large service provider completely. I don't think any of the site admins could have foreseen that Linode would get owned in this way, even though it seems so elementary in hindsight. The issue is that the choice of host is irrelevant - even at EC2, without reprogramming vast swathes of bitcoind, you're always at some level of risk from your provider. There are many things that these guys could have done to lower this risk, but it wasn't really ever considered a risk before.
Heck, how many sites out there are running on dedicated servers that aren't locked up entirely in a cabinet or cage that the owner controls? *All* those sites are potentially at risk from their provider understanding Bitcoin and turning evil, or some upstream security breach, or whatever.
You're correct that the community will learn from this, and I genuinely hope it starts people thinking about the security of live wallets. 
It's been on my todo list for a while to try and figure out how to get bitcoind to operate in a "half-wallet" capacity, where I run my wallet.dat through a python script to invalidate all the private keys, but still have bitcoind count up balances for those addresses. I figure if that can be done, then if there's an RPC call to tell you how many addresses are left in the pool (since the daemon will not be allowed to create new addresses) then with a sufficiently large pool of pregenerated addresses, the incoming transaction side of the equation is solved (say, for online merchants).
There has to be other solutions to the problem of keeping many thousands of BTC on a live server when you have to have outgoing transactions - hopefully this attack gets people thinking about them.

It's all in the second (I think?) Bitcoin thread on SomethingAwful forums (if you still have access to read it without an SA account).
Basically him insisting on Pattaya for a Bitcoin conference was a little weird (it's considered by many to be the child sex capital of asia), which started a few goons digging. After a lot of digging they learned all sorts of things, such as the skype name he used during the filming of the Bitcoin show being associated with "Pure Unconditional Non-judgemental Love" or some shit (which is vague and circumstantial at best), and that him and Ed were apparently the ring leaders in an un-authorized mortgage broker who at best got overwhelmed during the mortgage crisis and took brokerage fees from people who lost their houses anyway due to a lack of resources, and at worst Bruce allegedly took money for application fees and never intended to deliver.
Apparently the scam was repeated in two more states, but I don't actually recall ever seeing proof he was legally disallowed from starting a business.
As for why much of the Bitcoin community has a hard-on for hating him, it's because Bruce was basically the front-guy for an entire movement in many people's eyes, and it's kinda tough to argue that Bitcoin isn't a den of thieves and scammers when the mouthpiece for the movement is one. :(

Dwolla deserve this.
I'm still a Dwolla client, and I'd still happily accept it if any customers were willing to pay via it, but they do deserve it. What we've been told about the chargebacks insists that for some reason they thought it wouldn't be an issue with their account verification, and they therefore had absolutely no process to deal with chargebacks.
When I first signed up for Dwolla, I immediately thought it'd be great for hosting companies regardless of what happened with Bitcoin - the language was extremely attractive: something to the tune of "never worry about chargebacks."
Getting defrauded almost 6 digits is not "never worrying about" it. Arguably, this is *worse* than Paypal's model, because at least Paypal let you know up front that there's a chance you can get fucked.

No, the block chain only keeps track of inputs and outputs (it's just a distributed ledger), but from that you can calculate balances - the entire process of determining if a transaction is valid depends on it.
@_date: 2012-10-11 01:33:53
I think the real reason is that most pool operators keep the tx fees,  distributing the block reward to miners. Your scenario accomplishes one of a couple outcomes:
* Miners, who are not all profit motivated, say "fuck this" and some move to a pool that's not being a cunt. 
* Miners demand a share of the tx fees or they'll do option  (which may result in a net loss of income to the pool operator). 
* Pool operators, many of whom think the longevity of the idea trumps short term profit, will refuse to do it, providing no shortage of alternate pools for option 
That pretty much leaves option  as the only practical outcome if anyone wants to do this and not immediately burn their pool to the ground. 
What you have to remember is that in a low barrier to enter field like mining pools, it's a race to the bottom, not to the top. The fees for block inclusion will happen when it's a choice between that and losing money out of principle.

So your problem with Ripple is that a user can gain trust in the beginning, if the costs of gaining said trust are less than the benefits at the end, people will still scam? This is different from various Bitcoin-related disasters (pirateat40 et al) how exactly?
I think you're selling the Ripple idea a bit short: it's pretty much an open credit network, so of course it's going to revolve around debt. Much like the "who goes first" aspect of Bitcoin trade with virgin parties, there are trust issues, but they'll probably eventually be resolved.

@_date: 2012-01-29 03:42:17


Misleading, IMHO. Miners (and all clients, really, except thin clients that don't validate their own blockchain) don't have to decide not to follow a cheated fork, unless they're actively configured to do so they'll always disregard invalid blocks regardless of the length of that fork. The way it's worded above, I think it kinda sounds like "well if a majority agrees that I get paid 1337 BTC out of thin air, I do" when that's not really the case.
The length of the chains matters for double-spending, but you were talking about redirecting transactions or awarding fake coins - neither of these have much to do with the length of the chain. If a block's invalid, it doesn't matter how many child blocks it has.

Just about every pro-Bitcoin post I've ever seen, ever... it all smacks of astro-turfing. I'm not saying it is, I'm saying it just looks like it, and that's why I think most people don't take it so well. When you suggest a new measure of accounting to someone, they're automatically going to be sceptical.
Considering that lots of people have vastly different interpretations of the word "freedom" (and that "freedom" in the sense many Bitcoiners argue is completely counter to what the "Internet Declaration of Freedom" people would envisage), and that you're basically going in there saying "hey, why not use this awesome new currency of which I may or may not already hold a considerable stake in", I'd say the response overall to every post I looked at in that subreddit went down pretty well.

That was my point, and I think we agree. Jeff can work on Bitcoin, do a lot of fantastic work, and disagree with several of the uses for it. If Jeff and the other developers decide they don't want (to take the top example community on the sidebar for instance) Girls Gone Bitcoin to be promoted in the context of the developer channel, I don't think that's an unfair request either.
Throwing insults like "state sucker" and whatnot just makes Bitcoiners look like the libertarian man-children most of them act like. It's not an unfair request, even though Bitcoin is quite well suited to sanction busting, to not discuss or promote it in the context of developer circles.

They do actually, just not in the way you think. If every client checks that every block conforms to the rules, then those clients become a democratic part of what those rules are.
If the clients blindly trust the source they get their balances and shit from, then the checking that the blocks conform to the rules happens on a much smaller scale.
Clients that do this *and* mine obviously contribute to security on two fronts: by enforcing the rules *and* by providing proof of work to ramp up the costs of an attack.

I suppose you could call them that? There are some subtle differences between EC2 and Linode, but they both run off Xen and they're both far and away different from shared hosting.


Yes, and yes. You can configure a Linode so that the Linode panel can't reset the root password - I'm pretty sure Linode's panel doesn't grok the filesystem running on my FreeBSD Linode, anyway. Full-disk encryption would almost certainly have done the trick too, as I said earlier.
I don't disagree with your final paragraph, I just think the attitude of your entire post is a bit wrong-headed. Your original post basically boiled down to "hurr this could have been avoided for $40" when it really couldn't, and I've yet to see anyone put forth a solution to the problem of keeping hot-wallets secure. I'm beginning to think there isn't one - that the only solution is a person 24/7 monitoring the wallet, keeping the bare-minimum necessary in it and transferring funds into it as necessary for payouts.
I don't even think multi-sig is a solution to this problem. Gavin mentions it, but when you think about it, that second host? There's probably a pretty good chance he'd have been running it on Linode as well, so multisig wouldn't have helped at all (just complicated things for the attacker). Even if he weren't, boxes still get owned every day and while this particular incident was quite loud (the required reboot for the root pass change to take effect) the next one may not be. The only possible solution would be for him to keep the second set of keys offline, and once per day or whatever approving transactions - it's probably just as easy to drastically lower the size of the live wallet for outbound transactions and then not use a live wallet at all for inbound transactions.

Of course the costs also go up if you normally shut your computer off or put it on sleep - as you have to factor the additional draw in from the rest of your PC.
That said, you asked about fun - if you fully understand the fact that if you burn out your 6850 you will *never* make enough money out of BTC to pay for a new one, then have at it. People burn up racks of Nvidia cards folding for no gain at all - and if you view it as a hobby then your card's more than adequate.
Before I moved to Australia (where the power cost is prohibitively expensive) I was running my 5770, without overclocking, and would buy something new with BTC about once a week. I wasn't really gaining anything - more transferring cash from my power bill to my entertainment funds, and there was a risk I could kill my 5770 or my PSU, but again... it's a hobby.

I whole-heartedly agree. I have a Linode, and there *are* several things that could have been done to mitigate the damage from this attack that weren't. But they weren't, and not much of it has to do with Linode.
The irreparable damages in this particular case are wholly associated with Bitcoin, not Linode. Every machine could be hacked sooner or later, such is the nature of Information Security. The only thing that matters is how much effort you expend to make sure it doesn't happen, and how good your plan is for containing and reacting to it when it does. Keeping almost $250k worth of non-recoverable internet gold on a server is just brain-dead, regardless of where it's hosted.
I personally find it hard to believe that Bitcoinica's 24, 12, or 6 hour withdrawal volume is 43kBTC. I stepped down the hours, because if by some miracle they do withdraw that much BTC in a 24 hour period, then you need to close up the period, even if zhou has to get out of bed every few hours to push more funds across. If he's making enough that he can cover this loss, then he's making enough to lower the exposure that getting thoroughly owned brings.

As I understand it, you have four options (because I specifically asked about a few of these scenarios):
1) You price in Bitcoins, receive Bitcoins (after they take their cut).
2) You price in Bitcoins, receive USD (after they sell the BTC at market rate, and take their cut).
3) You price in USD, receive Bitcoins (they give the buyer the current price in BTC, buyer pays quoted price in BTC, they forward the BTC less their cut).
4) You price in USD, receive USD (they give the buyer the current price in BTC, buyer pays quoted price in BTC, they sell BTC and give you USD minus their cut).
I could be wrong about any of the above, I only really looked at it in passing because at present WHMCS is what we use for our billing - but as I said our BTC volume is so ridiculously low it's just easier to do it by hand.
I would definitely email their people, or try catch them on the BitcoinTalk forums - they were really responsive to me when I was inquiring and I am not even signed up. It bugs me also how IIRC you can't even find out the rates without signing up, so you're not alone with that. But an email should fix it.

I *think* (I too freely admit I don't completely understand it) the idea of Ripple is "social capital". You'd mainly use Ripple with people in your immediate social circles, let's say college kids or a neighborhood, or possibly a communal living group.
The idea being that while on the Bitcoin-OTC, your reputation is simply built up over time, but is virtually anonymous. Thus, the cost of building your reputation is quite simple to figure out, from the perspective of a person running a long-con.
In my understanding of Ripple networks, your reputation is tied to your "social capital" (that is, your standing in your immediately social networks). In the above-mentioned college kids example, how many kids are going to be willing to rip someone off for an Xbox 360 only to have everyone on campus know about it?
I think from that perspective, it solves one problem with Bitcoin quite nicely and indeed meshes excellently with it: as you said, Bitcoin could be an easy way to settle up IOUs when the dust settles.

Ahh I see - you're only counting the cost of GPU. Also factor in that you're pulling almost 2x the hashrate I was at negligibly more power draw (IIRC a 5770 is ~220MH/s @ 110W?) and I can see how you're still reasonably profitable.
It doesn't scale particularly well, as if you want to mine in more PCs than you currently leave on 24/7, you'll have to factor in the costs of the rest of the PCs as well, but thanks for the figures anyway. Apparently BTC mining isn't as dire as I thought it was.
@_date: 2012-02-09 21:36:43
If you're dead set on doing that, you might as well just burn up what you've got. Unless you have phenomenally cheap or truly free power, you will probably never break even on the hardware cost unless you simply hold the BTC long-term and hope it appreciates. Even then, if you believe it'll appreciate, you're probably better off taking whatever you were going to spend on a new Radeon, and simply buying the BTC (unless you were going to buy a new Radeon for gaming anyway).
The tiny profit available (again, assuming low electricity costs) is pretty much discounting having to buy any hardware these days - the days of a new Radeon paying for itself are pretty much gone. Buy hardware if you want to invest in what you consider a hobby, but don't consider it a sound investment - consider it more of a lottery ticket that will let you play some sweet video games.

Oh, thanks. I was under the impression that Yubico needed the same procedure as MtGox, where they wouldn't trust you to upload your own private key. I knew you can reprogram them though.
Yes, they are regular keys with the MtGox logo on them. MtGox will refuse to change the private key on any account, all they'll do is want to mail you a new key to the authorized address on file and charge you for a new key.

It should do. I haven't actually used it, I only took a passing look at their WHMCS module (I wouldn't run it on my production billing system until I've thoroughly vetted it myself, and I never found the time - my Bitcoin volume is so tragically low it's still not worth automating it) but it appears to use callbacks for payment notifications.

Because we still haven't achieved any sort of stability with the price (I admit we're close, but the last time I said something like "man this $5 feels good" we set off on another dive, so I'm not saying that again).
Going to your favourite store and seeing prices have gone up is a bit of a slap in the face, but you deal with it.
Friday rolling around and only getting 7/10ths of your pay is another thing all together. I've done a few small jobs for Bitcoin, and my company accepts Bitcoin, but I'm buggered if I'd let anyone pay me a wage in it.

Australia's currency has gotten super strong on the last decade. It's hurt quite a few exporters, it means that more of our tourists go overseas and fewer can afford to come here.
A strong currency more or less means a big flow of money out of the country that issued it, which is not necessarily a good thing...

I've thought about this before, and I'm far too lazy to implement it myself but it seems to me like if you're doing the sort of volume that the major exchanges are doing, that you could have a couple of people to deal with this:
Front-end exchange site handles orders, balances, etc. Spits out, on the back-end, a list of requests for the wallet(s).
Requests are handled by a real person, who vets each request quickly (really just checking for anomalies) before doing the actual withdrawal. You could even get really serious and have the wallet offline, generate the transactions then physically take them to an online machine to inject them to the network.
It kinda ties in to what I wanted to do - hack the bitcoind daemon (if it can't already do it, I haven't kept up on it) to be able to operate with only the list of public keys for addresses. Generate a pool of say, 10,000 addresses, then run a script over a copy of the wallet to obliterate the private keys leaving only the public part.
Upload this "read-only wallet" to your web-server, and have it watch for transactions as per usual. Withdrawals are handled by a real person, on a separate wallet.
You still have some exposure - I could hack your server, inject a couple of my own addresses into the wallet and hope they get sent to a user who's going to send a lot of money. But I really think that this sort of an approach would limit the exposure much better than hot/cold wallets would (simply put, if your hot wallet is more money than you can stand to get hacked, take the sites down while you re-image every server, patch the hole, then put the site back up without having to explain to users where their funds are, then your hot wallet is too big).
But as I said, I'm far too unmotivated to write an exchange.

It's not "theft" if you can jump through the stupid AML hoops and get your funds back. As sgornick says above, if you use a site that's a conduit to the stupid money system, don't be surprised when the stupid comes back up the conduit.
The first people to get bit by the AML policies had a legitimate grievance. If you deposited or failed to remove BTC in the last twelve months, you don't get to whine.
The fact that Bitcoiners can tout the irreversibility of BTC, can talk about trust metrics and whatnot to pretend the irreversibility is a good thing with no negatives, and then continue to use a site in a manner that could screw them speaks volumes of their intelligence.
**If you are not willing to do the AML thing, do not use mtgox**. Not even for little transactions. Don't use them at all. Definitely don't whine when their policies (which are not in any way new) come about and tie up your funds.

If you don't care about ever using it again on MtGox (say, MtGox closes up shop), you can reprogram it like a typical Yubikey. But you'll be throwing away the keys to that MtGox account, because it should be impossible to extract the private key from the device, and MtGox sure as hell won't disclose it (and won't let you change it, if you provide them with a new key that you've generated yourself - they have to program the key and mail it to a realistic sounding address for AML stuff).

This is a common misconception about Bitcoin "hurr if I control 50% or more of the network I can just print myself all the Bitcoins!"
No, *every* client that downloads the full blockchain (ie, everything but header-only clients such as mobile ones, electrum (I think?), etc) checks the rules on the blocks. *Every* client that checks the rules on the blocks will reject "invalid" blocks, so every client that checks the block chain will need to be updated in order to increase the limit.
Most of the Bitcoin holders will all immediately argue that since they're holding Bitcoin under the assumption there can *never* be more than X amount of them, that it's unfair to create more, for any reason (and they're pretty much right). 
So best case scenario is you fragment the network between the people sticking to the original rules and the people with the new rules. The worst case is that people rage-dump their BTC never to touch cryptocurrencies again, since one of the primary design goals of Bitcoin was "proven" false. Either way, faith in cryptocurrencies is dashed, so better just to not fuck with the rules.
@_date: 2012-10-08 21:17:35
To determine whether or not a new transaction is valid (the hard part of Bitcoin), yes.
I'm not sure if there's a method specified in the whitepaper or not on how you avoid having to "just trust" the old blocks that are pruned were valid at the time of pruning, or whether you maintain the accuracy still via some more voodoo magic.
But "just trusting" old blocks wouldn't be the end of the world - we already have checkpoints in the official client anyway so you could probably just prune all the blocks of their spent transactions up to the latest checkpoint, distribute that with the new official client and off we go.
Some people will probably keep the un-pruned blockchain around, whether it's for datamining or some other purposes the free market decides...

They can't just refund when you hit AML thresholds. That would be essentially admitting to regulators that they'll launder up to a point. You knowingly choose to use an exchange that states they'll advise by regulations, then you complain when the regulation touches you?

You can re-flash them to use them for other things, but it's not worth as much as an original Yubikey because 1) you can't use it with MtGox and 2) you can't use it with the original Yubico authentication stuff.

I just don't see how ASICs are the future right now, and I feel like proponents of them are way too eager to jump into the future.
GPUs and FPGAs are repurposeable. If the shit hits the fan and SHA turns out to be unsuitable going forward (admittedly that's a huge if) then with ASICs you're stuck with a whole fuckton of hardware that's just a liability to dispose of (unless anyone's looking for a large-scale SHA brute-force farm for some reason, after it's proven no good for Bitcoin).
At least with FPGAs (even if they do take forever to recoup their costs in power savings) you can reprogram them if the mining algorithm ever changes.
P4man brings up some great points, particularly about the development costs involved in bringing your first ASICs to fruition.

It's a shitty implementation in it's current form, for the fact that there's no way to adjust new printing (:gasp:) to have it grow with economic use such as to maintain a stable price. Many Bitcoiners will claim that it's intended to work this way, but I really just think it's because there's no real way to solve this problem without giving up the things that make Bitcoin Bitcoin.
If a solution to that problem is ever found, expect Bitcoin to move aside and for the new cryptocurrency to take over. The only people who view this "feature" as a good thing are the douches who think that holding money should net you more money. I'm a capitalist myself, but I freely admit that "money begets money" is probably the only *real* problem with capitalism.
That said, you're completely wrong on the peak. The "peak" is far closer to the present than it is to the release of Bitcoin's paper. The genesis block was pushed out in January, 2009, the peak occurred June of last year. It hasn't "declined in value since", if I'm not mistaken it's been "around" $5 for quite some time - which is impressive given the arse-pounding it's taken in the public eye.
I think two of the chief issues facing Bitcoin are thus: 1) it has no ability to react to swings in usage beyond the private market makers, which inevitably leads to someone with a ton of money making *more* money at the expense of others.  2) Using Bitcoin safely pretty much depends on levels of computer security that very few people can meet these days.
As far as buying it for $5 or not... well there's a reason it's called speculation. If we already knew the "true" value of it, it'd probably be selling for around that.

Which is why I like Yubikey (though I know nothing about GA with MtGox). Until you issue a withdrawal request of your own, they can't.

It can't be increased easily - it would involve replacing every single client, miner, etc... in addition to this, it would screw over people holding Bitcoin (who, each and every one of them, are holding it under the assumption there can never be more than the max amount, ever) and destroy faith in crypto-currencies.
But it's not even about the max limit... we have a constant trickle of ~7200 new coins every day. On days when there's more than ~7200BTC worth of new economic activity joining the economy, the value goes up. The opposite's also true.
This is not a feature of Bitcoin, it's that way solely because there's no decentralized way to solve the problem (in my humble, non-satoshi opinion). Ideally, it'd be tied to some decentralized measure of economic activity, to keep the price stable (along with some way to burn old coins when the economy slumps). Whoever solves that one gets a giant head start pre-mining the new cryptocurrency, and they bloody well deserve it because it's not a trivial problem.

If you think that refusing to provide services to Gab or Alex Jones is "discrimination" you really need to go back to high school because having an adult conversation with you is impossible.

You can log into the machine, as if you were local, via LISH. The reboot's required to set the password, I think because Linode don't risk the Xen host writing to the filesystem while it's mounted by the guest.
If you have an encrypted file system, where the key must be manually entered upon boot (which is how I'd do it[1]), this particular attack would have been foiled. However I'm quite sure no one saw this coming, and anyone who did would also see the potential for attacks via RAM.
I think the "hurrrr this could have been prevented for $40" statement is a bit ignorant, given the facts of the breach. If I were a betting man, I'd almost lay down a hundred bucks to say that AWS will get owned at some point in the next ten years.
1) Think about it, in Bitcoinica's case, the server was just for handling the wallet. Nagios could watch for the server to stop responding, and notify zhou to get up and restart it. He does a few quick sanity checks, and enters the encryption key via LISH (again, this is still vulnerable to a rooted Xen host). Because it's only handling the Bitcoin transactions, the only noticeable effect to end users would be delays in deposits/withdrawals until he boots it up again.

They didn't give out keys/DB snapshot? Jed, the previous owner, still had admin access to the site because of the details of the MtGox buyout by Mark. At least that's my understanding of it.


Linode is not a shared host, it's a Xen-powered "cloud" provider. In that sense, it's not that different from EC2 at all - other than that you might consider people who work for AWS to be more trustworthy than those at Linode (some others might consider the opposite to be true).

Look, I'm no fan of Theymos, and I reckon he probably could have done it with one of the paid forum software packages. A modified VB works for the goons, it'd probably work for him. 
Having said that, and despite my reservations as to how the developer and stack were chosen, he's the custodian of the donations and he's within his rights to do something like this. His justification was piss-weak and borderline idiotic, but he can still do it. 
If he wants to use all that donated money to create a new player in the open source forum world, who cares. I know that given the lack of transparency with how the developer was selected I certainly wouldn't donate, but I didn't donate to begin with so I don't have a dog in this fight.

I dunno if I'm exactly a statist, I do know that I'm not exactly a libertarian and I'm definitely not an ancap. I do not believe in government for the sake of government or regulation for the sake of regulation, and I do not believe that all regulation is inherently bad. Curiously, I believe one of the functions of government should be, in an ideal world, to offset the fact that money begets money (something the US is not stellar at) - Bitcoin does nothing to this end either. 
I think Bitcoin is a neat idea, a terribly interesting experiment. It's my personal belief that the Bitcoin ecosystem is going to relearn many of the painful lessons society has learned in the past because many of its advocates don't agree with conventional wisdom... But I think that's part of the charm, even if I am a statist - if conventional wisdom is correct, some fools and their money are parted, if it's wrong, that's huge.

The really hilarious thing about Ripple is that once you get over the hate, they do have a neat idea and it would have made a neat companion to other cryptos.
They then pissed all over that idea with a premine (because it has to have a currency! spam! it's not worth anything, it's just a postage stamp, but our entire organization's fiscal future depends on it appreciating in value! jed you're a cunt for selling all yours!), taking so long to get source out (I seriously still haven't even looked at the source for the servers, I lost wood a long time before they released it and it hasn't come back yet) and now this.

Those rumors are based off the speculation that when MtGox moved their online funds to an emergency wallet in a secure location, that the amount of funds they moved didn't add up to how much funds people had in there.
The problem with this assumption, as I've stated elsewhere, is you're assuming that someone foolhardy enough to run an exchange is stupid enough to keep all holdings online at all times. 
They had a $1,000USD BTC withdrawal limit per day. It only makes sense to keep enough holdings accessible to the automated, online system so that you statistically speaking avoid the possibility that someone might get tripped up by a "we're sorry, we can't process your withdrawal right now" error.
Keeping any more BTC (keep in mind that if someone loots BTC, it's gone forever and you have absolutely no recourse getting it back) on hand than is necessary to satisfy these requests is just needless exposure.

No, if you run a full Bitcoin client, the blockchain is stored locally... but the "coins" aren't actually *really* stored anywhere. The coins are nothing but imaginary tallies noted in a ledger which is made up of the blockchain. When you earn coins (through mining or someone sending them to you), they're signed over to your keys per the rules of the network. When you spend them, your keys sign them over to someone else.
wallet.dat stores the private keys to whatever coins you control at the time (actually wallet.dat typically has a reserve of unused keys as well, so you can back up the file and then receive new transactions and the backup stays useful for a while), and your blockchain files store the entire ledger. Once your keys sign the coins over to someone else's keys, the keys are useless (unless you want to send them more coins, but that's considered bad practice unless you really don't care about privacy at all).

I'm still mining, so I'll have more to play with if/when they get things sorted out.
I am under no illusions that their site is in any better shape than MtGox in terms of security. The person who's hacked MtGox account caused this mess is a patent fucking idiot - you think leaving ~$500k laying around on a Windows laptop is dumb? How fucking idiotic you gotta be to leave almost $5m laying around on some jank-ass website? Does this person wear a bike helmet all day or what?

Although this writes more like an EncyclopediaDramatica entry than anything else, they're pretty much not wrong about Bitcoin.
The paragraph you're quoting? Read almost every asshole who is concerned about the direction Bitcoin's headed since July. They're not concerned about the shrinking market (or rather, the inflation that's outpacing it), they're not concerned about the PR-ass-pounding it's taking, they're not concerned about the reduced buying power of 1BTC, nor are they concerned about the complete lack of faith people put in a currency that can lose up to 50% of it's value in a matter of days...
... no, the sole thing most of these assholes are worried about is "how do we get more people to invest in Bitcoin so the price will go up?" Let that sink in for a minute, and then explain to me how Bitcoin *isn't* primarily a pump-and-dump to most people who are involved in it.
Keep in mind that I use Bitcoin, I sell services in Bitcoin, I'm a small-time miner, and I buy things all the time in Bitcoin, before you call me out for something idiotic. I fully understand that Bitcoin has other uses *besides* being a pump-and-dump, but that's not what's under discussion here. What's under discussion is whether most people involved are simply trying to inflate the BTC's worth, so as to inflate their own net worth.
In that sense, I don't think this is an incorrect assessment of the Bitcoin "community".

MtRed is, for the most part, "big enough" right now. Every once in a while, my dumb-ass winds up pool hopping to deepbit just because I feel like MtRed hasn't found a block in ages...
... doing the math and averaging things out though, I'm always screwing myself over when I do it. Deepbit's constant payouts are nice, but they're *tiny* compared to what I make each block MtRed finds. MtRed might go over a day without finding a block, but then it'll have periods where we find five in four hours.
If you leave it on a week and average things out, MtRed is definitely the way to go for a Redditor who wants to mine. Sign up for Deepbit/Slush for when MtRed is having problems, and call it a day.

That's for MD5 - when I looked into it, commercial SHA-256 (which is what I believe Bitcoin work entails) cores can do it in something like 50 clock cycles, which is substantially lower (though I don't recall the exact numbers).

Just thought I'd post back - I decided to give it a shot, reasoning that the software wouldn't throw the private keys to addresses a way immediately, and it successfully attributed two donations to the same address to the site I wanted it linked to.
I sent a bit more that should confirm in a bit, that'll hopefully push the Doctors without Borders over the 1.0 threshold so hopefully the site operator can make a donation and start developing a reputation (at which point I will most likely donate to the Humane Society because dogs rule).
Edit/Update: Never mind, [the extra]( I sent didn't show up on the site and it's been over 10 confirmations. There goes that idea. :(
Edit/Update  The owner of the site emailed me back, apparently all the transactions are credited by hand, and so doing it this way will work... but it's a pain in the arse for him/her to match them all up, and that's why it asks you how much you're donating.

I think the wallet storage or colocation ideas are non-starters myself. 
At the moment, the profit margin on mining for many people is razor thin as it is - though some people may be still raking it in because they pay less than normal for their electricity and/or cooling. Neither group is likely to spring the money to make colocation worth it, unless you got filthy cheap rates on power, and you lived somewhere like the colorado rockies where you could simply blow fresh mountain air through the top of your DC to cool it (and thus avoid so much expense in AC/chilled water).
The wallet storage thing: we're so close to 0.40 you can smell it, which will have wallet encryption in it. What can you do, that encrypting the wallet and sticking it in dropbox can't, particularly that would allow you to monetize it?

Even that's not entirely true though - there are many irrational people mining at a loss. Either because they don't know any better, or their losses are subsidized (say, free power where they live), or they think the price is going to go up.
Those who are still mining and selling are pushing the price down below the cost to mine. Also note that the cost to mine isn't static - if you live in a cool area with easy access to cheap electricity, you're going to cost a lot less than someone in a hot, humid area with 20c/kWh juice.
I myself still mine even though it's in my best interest not to. I don't burn much juice doing it (running one 5770) so I don't even notice the electricity bill; it's cold now, so a little extra heat is welcome; and I get to spend the Bitcoins on dumb shit I wouldn't normally spend "real" money on, without thinking. 
It's probably costing me say $30 a month to make $20 worth of Bitcoins, but it's a hobby so I do it anyway. So Bitcoins aren't even worth what it costs to mine in many cases.
Your second paragraph is mostly correct - trying to predict the price of Bitcoin if you are a layperson is just silly. If you're a market maker making predictions and investments based off those predictions, then you deserve everything you get - either way.

It's worse than that I think - I believe that you'd also need to know the exact transactions the pool server included in the block it made, plus the exact order of them.
I believe all the pool server sends to the miners (I haven't looked at them) is a hash of the block, and tells you to look for a nonce to add to it that hashes out below the target. I may have some of those details wrong, but anyway I think the answer is yeah, it's not possible to cheat.

To get their attention, why not donate to the various charities on [bitcoin-charity.com]( with a link to r/Bitcoin and your Reddit username in the sponsor field?

I think (though I might be wrong) you're misunderstanding what he's saying... Bitcoin's value varies wildly anyway. When I saw MtGox pitch down below $10 in really short order, I didn't actually think anything was wrong - just a huge sell order. When you see it drop below 10c, it becomes apparent this probably shouldn't be happening, but $30-&gt;$10 is "normal" for this market in many people's eyes.
If you saw a sudden pitch downwards and then trading locked up so you were unable to do anything about it, it might sour you on the whole market and end up hurting the value more than just letting the trades play out, letting people play the market and stabilize it (there is *tons* of money out there just waiting for another sub-$10 price so they can buy back in).
In that respect, particularly on a market known for it's volatility and it's sometimes violent swings, circuit breakers might do more harm than good.
Edit: Now exchanges limiting huge orders (ie, if you're going to blow out more than $X percent of the order book), that might be an idea that has legs. Or not, I'm fucking clueless on trading to be honest.

I'm a Tradehill fanboy, and after listening to the interviews on that one Bitcoin show that just concluded, man... I'm really not convinced.
If I'm not mistaken, it was the lead programmer they were interviewing at the end after the MtGox interview... and they didn't know about client certificates in web browsers, or didn't want to use them because of some bullshit about keeping it simple for end users.
MtGox people said they didn't think bcrypt was all that good, so they're going to use their own SHA-512, 1000 iteration+salt setup.... uh oh.
Don't get me wrong, I'm a hacker in the second-worst sense of the word. I dabble in everything, taking the time to truly understand almost nothing. I'm not pretending to be an expert here, but hearing shit like that just makes me cringe. If there's one thing I've learned fucking around with crypto, it's that inventing your own crypto when there's a [perfectly fucking]( [good implementation]( already and you are ill-equipped to be doing so is just asking for tears.

1. Bitcoin has been getting slashdotted almost weekly for about a month or so now. :( But Reddit might have played a small part in the current boom.
2. No one has any way of knowing what the "true" market value of the BTC is - it's purely speculation. It's entirely possible we're way over what they're really worth, which would mean a correction downwards at some point. It's also possible (there's calculations somewhere on the Bitcoin forum) that if Bitcoin reaches even say 5% of what Visa or Paypal process, that the buying Bitcoins now is buying them at pennies-on-the-dollar for what they'll be worth in a decade.
3. Bitcoin is not anonymous - it's pseudonymous. If no one can pin the addresses on you, then you're effectively anonymous, but that's really no different to posting throwaways on Reddit. If someone can pin a username on you with evidence, then there's a detailed history of everything you've done. But yes, Bitcoin depends on tracing the history of a coin from it's generation (it's basically a giant distributed ledger) - it's the only way to confirm that a coin that's coming to you has not been spent already. I don't think it's in the current implementation, but there's talk about when transactions explode and nodes have difficulty keeping up, it will be possible to prune out the middle transactions and only keep the first and last - I don't fully understand how that's supposed to work though.
4. Check out the Bitcoin OTC group - they're a group on IRC and websites where you can do exchanges in person after negotiating them on IRC. If you're in any kind of built-up area, you'll likely find someone around you who will trade them for whatever currency or goods you desire.
5. The code is open source, check it for yourself. Or build it yourself. My guess is it's either a) idiotic rumor; or b) false positive because the Bitcoin client by default connects to an IRC server in order to gain a list of peers (and so looks like it's part of a botnet). You can disable this behavior once you have a decent list of peers if you don't want it stuck on an IRC network someplace.

There's a world of difference between "at least a bit friendly to their ideas" and "circle-jerk echo chamber". I observed a little while back that Atlas/Immanual Goldstein has fallen from grace with the BitcoinTalk crowd, but IMHO his ideas are of no worse a quality than people like FlipPro. 
I would almost guarantee that if a deep-cover troll invested a lot of time earning the good grace of that forum's little clique, then regurgitated one of Atlas' hair-brained ideas, that the forum would erupt into a circle jerk of support for the stupid scheme.
What people don't seem to understand is that there are people who are successful in business, and people who are not. If you don't have a mind to be successful in business, then there is not one redeeming quality about Bitcoin that will change you and suddenly make you successful. A dumb idea is a dumb idea, even when you strap Bitcoin to it.
I read r/Bitcoin, and I read the SA threads, because an outside perspective is good. You never grow as a person, as a business, or as a community, if you disregard outside commentary and merely surround yourself by people saying what you want to hear.

See I'm not an expert programmer by any stretch of the imagination (the Bitcoin7 thread where someone talks about shit PHP programmers? That's me they're talking about) - but I was under the impression that good encryption for wallet.dat is going to be rough. At the very least, I would want the option to only decrypt the private keys when I go to make a transaction... and then there's security wiping the sensitive data from memory and such.
Most of which is made moot by the fact that if you've got malware running in the same context as the Bitcoin application, all bets are off. Sure the current, fire-and-forget malware couldn't have stolen an encrypted wallet because all it does is search for and copy the wallet file - but all you're doing is raising the bar a tiny bit.

Yes, just because they dream of being the asshole who can say "I told you so" after it "pops".

I mostly agree with you.
Barring any actual show-stopping issues with the currency itself (eg, if the deflationary spiral doesn't turn out to be an unfounded idea, or if there's crypto issues) then we need to get past this turbulent stage of it's life. That means more economy, and less wealth disparity (I personally think we need to wait for all the early adopters to mostly cash out before we start to see the end of wild swings).
Doing all this bullshit all over again with another crypto-currency is going to be a lot for the world to take. I'm surprised Bitcoin's made it this far.
The wild swings are great fun for wannabe-daytraders like myself, but they're not good for business. A business accepting multiple currencies needs to be reasonably sure they can sell an item for a price, and then be able to pay their suppliers without the price tanking briefly in between.
The current solution for most businesses wanting to handle Bitcoin is simply to set your prices to a weighted average price, but it's still risky business.
All in all though it's been a pretty fun experiment so far, and it'll be interesting to see where it goes in the future. It looks pretty resilient at the moment, but we'll have to wait and see what happens when the funds from MtGox free-up and re-enter the market - there might be a whole ton of people looking to exit, or they might have realized it was a fault of MtGox, not of Bitcoin itself.

To be fair, that module *is* a small processor with a memory chip on it - as they vaguely described. The story about their cheap chinese manufacturer re-using already made PCBs could be remotely plausible.
The real WTF is that they found it cheaper to re-use the PCBs and design an ASIC with a similar pinout to the wm8505 when none of the design would make sense that way - an ASIC miner doesn't need all the buses to speak with things like a touch screen, sensors, memory cards, etc - it just needs to be able to communicate with the pool host and get power.

I understand what you're trying to say - except you're conflating everyone getting ripped off with the idea that *you* are overpaying for *electricity*, which you can then get back through mining.
All that's really going to happen is the people fucking you are going to get tired of being fucked. They'll turn around and fuck everyone else harder, leaving you at net-zero and everyone who's not mining at a net loss.
@_date: 2011-07-01 18:20:40
Yeah, except your truth table is pointing (unless I'm misunderstanding) that if mining is not profitable now, just hold on tight and it'll get better. I think that's a pretty huge gamble with other people's money considering that a) past performance isn't really much of an indicator of the future (all trends stay trends until they're broken, right?) and b) we've no way of telling if the price swelling to $30 and back down to $15~20 is still just a result of lots and lots of attention.
If Bitcoin's hype right now is a passing fad, and it settles down to drop to $13~15 and the difficulty steadily climbs upwards at 10% per period, I'll be fine for ages. The guy that's just bought a rig with 4 5830s in it? Maybe not so much.
IMHO now is an excellent time to start mining if you already have the card, or you were already buying the card for gaming purposes, or if you can afford to eat the cost of the equipment if it never pays for itself (do not bank on reselling it for even remotely normal used value as if it comes to that, the market will be positively flooded with equal cards). It's not a good time to be laying out ~$1k for a new mining rig, because the assumptions that you base your ROI on need to hold true for a really long time for them to work.

I believe so, yes... but double check the Wiki and/or search the bitcoin forums first.

If I had millions of dollars sitting around in cash, it could be transferred in minutes person to person - the benefit with Bitcoin is that it can go around the globe in the same amount of time it can go from my laptop to your desktop for me to kick in my portion of the case of beer. 
$1M+ in cash is, of course, going to be attached with trust issues, and on that scale Bitcoin wins out. But if you want to buy a hot dog, you give the hotdog stand your money and he gives you a hotdog. He doesn't wait for confirmations that the bill is legitimate. In that respect, Bitcoin is far from instant.
Right now if you attach a really juicy transaction fee to your transaction, the minimum time you can reasonably expect to wait is still ~10 minutes. That's not instant. It's still freakin' cool, but it's not instant... and telling people it's instant is likely to turn them off.
Bitcoin has a huge public image issue... people are told it's instant, it's tax-free, it's anonymous when it's technically none of these things. The loudest proponents of it come off like an libertarian/agorist nightmare - the average interested user doesn't want to topple the government or cripple it's ability to levy and collect taxes. Telling them Bitcoin is a tool to that end is likely to turn them off it permanently, so in such case the proponent is better off keeping their mouth shut.
There's a great page on the Wiki (which is down at the moment) about Bitcoin's public relations... what to tell people and what not to tell them - it's highly recommended reading before you go telling *anyone* what you're up to with Bitcoin.

"Double-spending trickled out *some* of our assets."
"We're down 51%, to the tune of some high-six-figures BTC."
People double-spent that much BTC and no one on the network noticed? Ohbitchplz.


It's not a weakness in implementing the Bitcoin protocol, it was someone that didn't understand it - one confirmation is still "unconfirmed" for exactly this reason. It's pretty easy to beat the network for one block (I forget what the percentages are for hashing power vs chance of success), but beating it for 6 blocks without someone noticing what's going on is far harder.
Nothing about this asshole Tom Williams adds up.

I liked it when they brought up net neutrality, and were basically insinuating that the market could be trusted do the right thing if the government just leaves it alone. Yet obviously the market can't be trusted to do the right thing, or else this guy would just shut the fuck up and accept that the trades are getting rolled back.
I am borderline libertarian - I cling to the belief that the government should only involve itself in our lives to the absolute minimal extent necessary... but man, if the goings on with Bitcoin and the people involved aren't a huge wake-up call that the free market can't be trusted to self-regulate, I don't know what is.
Case in point: You couldn't trust an early adopter not to cash out 17,000 coins on a fucking weekend. He'd probably have made a shitload more had he just waited 24~48 hours, but he didn't.
I'm not trying to say I've suddenly given up my halfhearted libertarianism, but fuck.

I have a suggestion - your form for non-anonymous donations generates a new address right? But it asks for an amount...
... could you set it up so I could pick a charity (I was going to do humane society, I sent 0.01 BTC there already, but at this point I would rather do the general one or the highest ranked charity just to help you bootstrap the process of getting the first donation done) and then it gives me an address and I can keep flinging small amounts there?
Also I'm not sure how your 99% efficiency guarantee is worded, but you might check into that. I was taking a bunch of small amounts (~0.02BTC) out of my MtRed account, and when I went to spend them all those tiny transactions resulted in a really large transaction (in terms of bytes) which the network insisted on burning me about 0.03BTC in TX fees (for less than 1BTC, resulting in ~4% fees). If your efficiency guarantee takes Bitcoin network fees into account, that's cool... but otherwise, I don't know if you can live up to that promise or not.

I wish they'd stop saying shit like this. Cash is *instant* for the most part, and proponents like to compare Bitcoin to cash. If you have a decently sized transaction fee attached, you're looking at ~10 mins to get confirmation of the transaction... and depending on the level of authenticity you desire one single confirmation may not be good enough.
No transaction fees? Sure they're entirely voluntary for the most part (but then again so are ATM fees, to an extent) but not only will there arise a time when you can't get a transaction permanently accepted without a fee, but the entire long-term survival of the network *depends* on fees after a while.
I think Bitcoin is an exciting idea (not exciting enough to invest my last dollars into it of course), but I just wish people trying to sell it to others would quit selling them on things it really *isn't*.
It's not transaction fee-free, it's not tax-free (at least, not any more than cash is), it's not instant (not compared to cash, EFTPOS, etc). It's still awesome and exciting, so why erect a strawman for opponents to knock down?

The most likely scenario for the future of Bitcoin IMHO is a bunch of multinational corporations that have farms of ASICs that do all the mining. As long as there's no real reason for them to collude to ruin their cash cow, it's unlikely they'll ever work together and destroy it (the idea of it being designed to be more profitable to play along).
Luckily corporations do not have a tendency to merge into monopolies when left to their own devices. ;)

Even if you had a much larger budget for hardware/power (even if there's "no bill", there are still other considerations with powering and cooling many kW worth of GPUs safely and reliably), you'd still only get a bullshit amount of BTC for a little while, after the difficulty adjustment takes place the most you're going to get is some percentage of ~7200 BTC per day.
For example if you had the budget to put together 1% of the hashing power, you're looking at ~72BTC/day, or some $220/day gross at the moment... for operating 1/100th of the largest (depending on measurement) distributed computing network in existence today.
My advice? If you want to be the special kind of idiot that invests $100k in Bitcoin, buy 'em slowly. Let's say $3 right now is what it's teetering at. $100k at $3/pop, at 7200 per day, would let you absorb almost five full days of buying up every single newly minted Bitcoin.
You won't have to do that though, because not every Bitcoin that's mined immediately hits the market, and unless something really bad happens, not every Bitcoin is going to fall below your price threshold (remember there are still other buyers too). My guess is you can probably get a good 2~3 months of supplying a solid floor to the price of Bitcoin. If it takes off without you, cha-ching! You've got a return on your investment, start thinking about what price you're willing to sell them at.
2~3 months, if nothing goes terribly wrong (not a particularly good bet, I think, as I said there's a special type of idiot who's willing to sink $100k in Bitcoins) to crash the price through the floor you're setting up, would really start to make people take notice. If the economy can get it's shit together, 2~3 months of price stability is probably enough to start having merchants take an interest in it. 
Personally I'd try analyze the markets a bit better and see if you can stretch your budget out for a year, because who knows what the fuck is going to happen when the mining reward halves for the first time, but if you could maintain price stability until then, holy shit.
TL;DR: If you're dumb enough to invest in a big way in Bitcoins, mining hardware ain't it. Even at $100k to invest (and "free" power), you are still not nearly rich enough to win the race to the bottom in terms of actual mining costs.

Yeah, I don't know how they do it in other states, but here in Indiana, they simply ask you for the USD value paid for the vehicle. I gather if you do a straight horse-trade for it, you'd put the agreed upon value of whatever you traded for it. There's a minimum of $500, and people do it all the time where they'll write the bill of sale out for $500 rather than whatever the car sold for to lower the sales tax.
I wouldn't do it personally, because if the bill of sale says $500 and they misrepresented the car fraudulently or some shit which leads to you suing them, the most of your money you could possibly win back (I believe) is $500.

More share of the network means payouts happen more often. Doesn't mean more money (because it's being shared with more people) but it does mean less variance in the amount of money you make per day.
MTRed goes from not finding a block in two days, to finding two in a day. Some people like the more stable return (plus the other features deepbit has), and I would imagine a vast majority of miners simply don't concern themselves with the health of the network as a whole.

... except you're ignoring that over the last two weeks, after a massive difficulty jump, we've had prices go up to no more than about $20, swinging a bit, and settling back down to $16~17.
Expecting the price to follow difficulty, or for the difficulty to swing back down is a seriously flawed idea. There are many people who aren't trying to pay for equipment who will happily mine much at much lower returns than people buying new rigs really *need*.
Case in point: over the last difficulty period, price has gone *down* and we're still going to climb up in difficulty again.
If you are convinced mining is still profitable buying a brand new rig to do it on, great - but I think it's wrong to convince others so. Let them run their own numbers.
... and remember, price *does not* follow difficulty.

Inviting others to join in sounds like a great idea. Tossing them a few coins, or agreeing to trade with them in coins (or use them on a Ripple network), all these things are constructive.
"We need more people to buy BTC because the price is going down" is pump-and-dump. There's almost no reason for the price of a BTC to be any indicator of it's health, the Bitcoin ecosystem is in better shape now than it was in June, and there's many of us out there who think that even three bucks might be overvalued (for right now anyway).
There's no reason for anyone to want the price to skyrocket up except to either a) increase their own net worth or b) to find a greater fool to unload the coins you overpaid for.

Not really the same thing though - my point is *the billing address of the credit card*, which goes a long way towards proving that the order is legitimate. "My credit card was stolen, I didn't order that!" "Well it was delivered to your billing address..."
BlockExplorer proves none of that.
Read GoogleCheckout's seller guarantee thing. They'll still fight the chargeback, but if they lose (and they may, if it's a stolen credit card that slipped through), you lose the money unless you follow that policy. Which, short of mailing a sealed envelope with a private key on it to the billing address is basically impossible when selling digital goods.

Since Bitcoiners aren't opposed to "wasting" large amounts of computing power, I think the simplest function to determine the winner is simple:
1) Order the lottery numbers in ascending order and hash that (SHA256 might be overkill).
2) Gather all "tickets" that meet the desired criteria (I'm sure there's a strict amount to enter, right? So you'd want to discard say, transactions &lt; 0.1 if your ticket price is 0.1) and assemble them in the order they appear in the block chain (the order of tickets in the same block is decided hours or days earlier by the miner who found the block).
3) Convert the hash of the numbers to a really big integer, and keep counting/looping through the entries until you land on that number (eenie-meenie-minie-moe on a grand scale).
You could write a Python script to do it and open source it on Github so that anyone with a working Bitcoind and Python could run the script and arrive at the same winner.
As you said, the only possible attack vector is that you make off with the jackpot, but assuming you're taking a small percentage of tickets as an administrator's fee I'd think that unlikely.
@_date: 2011-06-20 05:12:02
I think it's confusing because some software like vBulletin uses an additional salt, that's kept in the script configuration. I think it goes something like $hash = $salt . sha($globalsalt . sha($salt . $cleartext));
The idea being that in addition to the per-user salts breaking rainbow table attacks, and the global "salt" completely invalidating all the hashes if someone only nicks the DB and doesn't grab the config file as well.
It caused me no end of grief understanding this simple factoid a while back, and I straight refuse to believe I'm the last person alive to learn something.

Unless there's another jump in price that outpaces difficulty like before July, you may never make your money back on any hardware invested in Bitcoin mining now. If you want to look at it as being no different than folding or any of the other distributed computing hobbies, then have at it - but don't expect to get rich off it.
Also note that solo mining is silly unless you've got *serious* hardware (say, mid 5 digits worth). Join a pool, Reddit has it's own one in r/MtRed but there are some others. Elgius is pretty good and takes next to no configuring (no registration etc) if it doesn't trouble you it's run by a catholic (apparently it bugs lots of people?). Look for a pool that does merged mining, so you can grab some namecoins at the same time, then sell those for BTC to increase your profit for very little extra effort (MtRed and Elgius both do Merged Mining, as do lots of the other big pools).
Your Nvidia card, you're probably looking at 0.05BTC/day, give or take, based on variance. So about $5/month at current rates, but difficulty has been trending downwards more reliably than price lately, so things may look better in a few months. Maybe.
@_date: 2011-07-06 04:43:58
It's also worth noting two other details:
1) You can send BTC to your wallet as much as you like without additional backups, including using up to 100 addresses for the sends. The new addresses are only "used up" when you send Bitcoins somewhere else, and you get change back - the change goes to the freshly generated address.
2) You can ask the client to pre-allocate a bunch more keys to the key pool, then back your wallet up, and not back up anywhere near as often. I forget the switch name, I think it's -keypoolsize though.

It's funny all the "I told you so" and "I crashed the market!" posts on the forums - it's too early to say the market's fucked, it's the weekend and most of the exchanges have very few ways of getting fiat currency into them on weekends.
Monday is when it's truth time for the BTC. I've been really lucky this weekend, going in and out from selling at $30, all the way down. Each and every time I've managed to catch the highs and lows to my benefit, so I'm increasing my "imaginary" holdings. 
If they go back up (even a little bit) on monday, I'll have a good laugh. If they don't, well then my imaginary money wasn't worth the real money I thought it was. C'est la vie. It's been a fun weekend pretending I'm a day-trader, I feel like I need some suspenders, a cigar, and a fast car.

Half the answer.
The first half is that BTC is completely non-reversible, whereas Paypal is completely reversible and usually (except in the case of intangible goods) favors the buyer. But the intangible goods brings us to our next issue:
Paypal has decided that buying Bitcoin is against their ToS. It's been a long time since I read Paypal's ToS, but I believe it's against their rules to use it for the trade of currencies, which they've now halfheartedly recognized BTC as. Or maybe they just ruled specifically that this particular intangible good is too shady and too much a risk for them.
Whatever their actual footing for their position, trading BTC for Paypal basically works like this: you make a few successful trades, until someone decides to dispute one. You then claim that you delivered the BTC as promised, and they lock your account, returning whatever funds don't get returned to the buyer(s) whenever the hell they feel like it.
That's not even taking into account it's crazy easy to steal a Paypal account, buy some BTC off someone, and then you're long gone with them having absolutely no recourse by the time the real owner comes along with a dispute.

Important distinction: the *coins* aren't stored locally, the keys to unlock them are. The coins are in the blockchain.

Despite the fact that she was already operating a successful business (something I suspect very few people on that forum can claim) that could benefit from Bitcoin and vice versa (rather than the business hinging on Bitcoin) and knew the potential market better than any of us possibly could, she still received almost no respect at all simply due to her failure to join the circle jerk.

The attack ArtForz used is not related to hashing power. It's related to the flat fee system that RealSolid thought would be a great idea, but the fact is that the larger fees for larger (in bytes) transactions are there for a goddamn reason.
(Though you are correct about needing more hashing power to survive)

Whoever solves ("mines") the block that initially includes your transaction. In that way, think of your fee as more of a "bounty" to include your transaction in the block chain.
Note that in some pools, the pool will divide up the fees among the miners. Others (like MtRed) are fee-free for miners for the 50BTC reward, but they will keep any transaction fees in the blocks they solve.

Not if MtGox agreed to be a Yubikey authentication portal for them.
However that option is broken on there, I just decided to play with it and see how it works - when you select "MtGox Yubikey" it changes to "2 factor auth is not enabled on your account".
Registering an MtGox Yubikey with Blockchain.info as a regular Yubikey locks you out of your account, presumably because MtGox's keys, the base nonce or whatever Yubikeys calculate each OTP off of don't exist on Yubico's servers.

Bitcoin for services, particularly in chargeback-prone territory, is a fantastic idea. Those where a certain degree of anonymity is required could also benefit, as you said: private trackers. VPN providers. IRC hosts for the blackhats. I don't really agree that Silkroad is the only useful outlet for them. 
I agree with both you guys, there really isn't enough non-speculative market activity to sustain even the price we have, IMHO. Bitcoin's been marketed hard as a get-rich-quick scheme over the last few months, and I think it's been counterproductive. The investors provide liquidity, which has been good (I can accept BTC and know that if I wanted to I can turn it into USD, and that's mostly thanks to speculators) but when people started bandwagoning it as investment... well let's just say I really don't think we've seen all the fallout from the poor suckers that bought in at $20+.
I don't know where the "true" price is, but I do firmly believe we're going to drop down way below it and it's not guaranteed it'll come back to the true price. If it managed to glide gracefully down in price so that the difficulty could actually come back down in a reasonable period of time, that might happen - but from Sunday onwards we're obviously seeing a lot of people exit the market in a hurry.
This lower price point will (if it doesn't bounce back) almost certainly see a lot of miners shut off in the next week or so, making things harder for everyone. I honestly don't know that there's enough true-believers who will mine no matter what to sustain the network while it recuperates.
There's still absolutely utility in the Bitcoin network, everyone just has to hope it'll make it through the fallout of that ~$30 bubble.
@_date: 2011-07-09 12:40:06
Discussion on the Bitcoin forums suggests this isn't what's happening though - apparently there isn't really sufficient volume to support the idea that it's an early adopter cashing out that's causing the price to stagnate.
Personally I think the market lately has been rather good for Bitcoins. Sure the wild swings are fun if you want to play the market, but they're not very good for miners (of course, miners who got into the game based on low difficulty and $30 Bitcoins would probably disagree that the current state is good for them) but given the fact we've been relatively stable around $15~17&amp; for a couple weeks now, we might actually see some business take up soon.
&amp; Yes, I realize it's $14 right now, but we're also in "it's friday, sell everything" mode right now.

You "get" Bitcoins by mining them, the rules state that in each new block the miner is allowed to create a transaction with up to 50 brand new (as in, assigned to no previous address) BTC in them pointing wherever they like.
Again, you're misunderstanding - there are no Bitcoins, only a ledger of what addresses own what. Your wallet is just a list of keys to those addresses... getting older copies of the keys does not give you back the coins that used to be in those addresses, and spending the coins doesn't change anything about the keys.
FWIW: Wallets are *not* tied to one computer. If you generate a sufficiently large keypool, and keep an eye on it somehow (the current client makes that difficult) you can have the wallet on as many computers as you like. All you have to watch out for is that when you're getting to the point where you're almost going to generate another pool of addresses, you *must* make sure you generate the new addresses and matching keys on one machine, then copy that wallet over to all your other machines. If two or more machines generate new addresses, I believe they can generate different keys - sending the wallet from one machine to another, when the second machine has received coins the first didn't know about is a recipe for lost coins.

Fuck everything about this sentiment. The price stability is good for Bitcoin - it takes away a bunch of the risk prospective merchants were facing from the wild swings in valuation only a few weeks ago. No one's going to start using it as an actual currency if they can accept 1BTC for $30 worth of shit and then 4 hours later can only turn around and get $10 worth of shit for it.
All this speculation, all these investors - they're only coming in in the hopes that one day the currency becomes usable for trade, and if people keep pushing it to "investors" like some shitty forced meme, that's never going to happen.
Those investors don't make the market, and they don't give Bitcoin any real *worth* - a thriving economy would do that.
@_date: 2011-06-09 01:04:49


I would have reservations about saying that.... in two different manners. First of all, there are varying levels of trust that make one concerned about the double-spend attack (and if you're not the tiniest bit concerned about it, enough to learn why it's not so much of an issue, then you're not paying attention). Do you trust that one confirmation is enough to know you're in the longest branch of the block chain? How about 10? At what point do you believe that the block chain is long enough that a double-spend can't happen? I'd call that trusting in the Bitcoin system.
The second purpose of trust is that because they're a completely unbacked commodity, you "trust" that they'll be worth something when it's time for you to trade them off to something else. With the up-and-down of the BTC to USD right now, that's a bit rough... but it will get better as the market gets bigger.
Not that these things are show stoppers by any stretch of the imagination, I just don't think it's correct/smart to say "it's not dependent on trust".
If you simply mean that you don't have to trust the person sending you coins, you're absolutely correct, the above assumptions notwithstanding.

Sounds good to me. I just thought it would be great to have a 100% deterministic way to select winners that others could repeat themselves to verify, but that still had high entropy - and this was the first way my simple brain tried to solve the problem (I do not pretend to be a developer: I can hack in several languages, but am not a master in any).
But this way the only thing you really have to trust is that the person operating the lottery won't run off with the jackpot.
Though I do like the idea (that someone else suggested elsewhere in this thread) of using the Bitcoin blockchain as the seed for the hash, as you eliminate the outside authority.
On a side note: would a loop counter even be necessary, or could you simply use a modulo operator between the hash result and the total number of entries, and it would tell you what "entry number" is the winner? It's possible I might be confused there, and I do not know whether most languages have a modulo operator that would work with 256-bit numbers, but I'm just curious.

If I've understood everything correctly, Bitcoin is only "vulnerable" to this at very, very high cost (comparatively, it only cost ArtForz ~$6 to exploit this, and note that it has nothing to do with hashing power and everything to do with transaction fee schemes). Solidcoin is now only "not vulnerable" because of the idiotic 4KB transaction limit, which legitimate users (like exchanges) are hitting (IOW, he's DoSing his own network, cutting his nose off to spite his face).
There are probably still memory exhaustion issues in the Bitcoin client, but they will cost a lot more to exploit than Solidcoin did.

Yeah, so far I've never actually used Dwolla to put money *in* the exchanges, only to take it out... but I see it being two issues:
1) The ability to get money out but not put money in could mean more downward pressure on the price of BTC;
2) I was seriously looking at implementing Dwolla payments in our company's billing system, because 25c transactions and no chargeback risk is very attractive. I fail to see how advertising "no risk of chargebacks" isn't false advertising at this point, no matter which way you slice it it appears to be a false claim.

The difficulty is simply recalculated every X blocks so that the system makes it's best attempt at getting it back to the 6/hour goal. That means it can go down, but unfortunately it's a whole lot easier for it to go up than it is to go down.
If we're doing 12 blocks/hr we'll burn through the blocks twice as quick and reach the new difficulty. If a bunch of miners go offline and we drop to 3 blocks per hour, it'll take twice as long to reach the recalc point and drop the difficulty (unless I'm missing something).

Obviously tradehill's not just getting hammered by the people trying to make a quick buck off the turmoil.
I'm not unconvinced MtGox didn't get pwned (though others in another thread are doing a pretty convincing job at swinging me) but I'm pretty sure Tradehill is just getting hammered right now. I can get on it two out of three pageloads.
@_date: 2011-06-13 04:53:29
1) Mainly the geek factor. It's a fun little experiment - I have no interest in anonymity, tax avoidance or any of that paranoid bullshit.
2) We've accepted BTC payments for services, which we basically wrote off (from our perspective, so as not to gamble, we're viewing it as no different than giving out free services). I then took some of the earnings, and played the market for a fun weekend of short-selling the shit out of them. 
I was actually disappointed when the market didn't tumble back down again this afternoon, I sold some of the weekend's earnings off at $20 and was optimistic for another drop to about $12 or so. The USD market on Tradehill had almost no support (I think I'm using these terms right, I'm new at this) from $20 all the way down to about $13 or so - no more than 25BTC being sold would have sent it crashing back down... but I think all the panic sellers this weekend have already left the market - anyone holding BTC apparently still has balls. :(
3) Almost nothing. On the bright side though, I'm using the profits from a decent (or was it lucky?) weekend trading to help pay for a new GPU, assuming the price goes up. Worst case scenario I've bought an AMD instead of the Nvidia I was gonna buy but couldn't really afford. In that sense, Bitcoin is a currency backed by FPS in TF2.

No (well, maybe), just uneducated. So many of them have simply heard that through a bit of a convoluted process they can thrash their GPU and turn it into USD, and that's about the limit they've looked into it.
"Vast majority" is probably a bit strong language on my part, but I don't know how many miners actually give a shit about the health of the network... from what I've met many just want to put their GPUs to use earning cash when they're not gaming.

More hashing power in the pool == less variance in payouts.
Given a long enough timeline, your return will be the same (fees etc notwithstanding) - if you have two fee-free pools, and one is 400GH/s and one is 40GH/s, then over a long enough timeline you as an individual will get about the same return from both. But one may only find a block every few days, and one may find one every few hours.
Your estimated reward will go up and down based on how many blocks you've turned in, and how fast other people are turning them in. If you join a round when the pool is weak, your reward will shoot up - if a sizable amount of juice joins the pool after, your estimated reward will lower.

IMHO: The people pumping up the value of BTC in May/June denied everyone an opportunity (well, maybe not denied, but certainly set it back) at a reasonable growing economy by promoting the runaway price hikes as if it was a good thing. Yes, I realize that most of them didn't have a direct hand in the rampant speculation, but they sure as shit did their best to promote it.
I think my point stands... definitely a government enforcing something as idiotic as trademarks probably wouldn't fly with the majority of them (though that's probably debatable, depending on how far they go as far as "property rights") but definitely the attitude of "hey man, it's just capitalism" is rampant over there.
Let's put it in simple (albeit vague) language: the attitude of "Fuck your idea of 'fair', I'm here to make money" that leads to things like this jackwagon filing trademark applications is prevalent on the Bitcoin forums, yes or no?

You could send them to an address that very obviously doesn't have available keys to it - the SA goons have one they were throwing around that's something like 1kD0ntxSend893Coinsl3hEre or something like that... pretty unlikely someone has the private key to such an address.
Miners can also "destroy" up to 50 coins per block too - if you send your coins to a miner that you trust to destroy them, then they simply choose not to collect the reward that matches the amount they're asked to destroy. Once that block matures, there's a record in the blockchain of how many coins were destroyed (or rather, never claimed).
There's lots of possibilities for shit like this right in the protocol.

Solo mining is not worth it unless you have some serious hardware. Yes, if you find a block you stand to make a cool $1000~1500 all to yourself, but without some serious capability you could go a long time with zero returns.

If it starts to catch on though, I'm pretty sure there's more entropy in the second password (can't be bothered calculating it), if the attacker can make a pretty reasonable assumption that it's only alphabetical characters in there. In other words, that approach is fine until everyone starts doing it.
Replace a couple letters with some symbols, and you've got a decent case - passphrases are definitely better than passwords.

This is the part that isn't stressed enough, I think. The computations need to be computationally expensive, because if they weren't someone could simply compute a block chain that had transactions in their favor. If it's longer than the "official" block chain, it becomes the "official block chain".
Usually when people bring up this question, it's followed up with "well why can't we put it to good use, doing something like folding". Discarding the crazy notion that perhaps agreeing on a single, worldwide ledger in order to have a completely decentralized currency is "good use"...
... implementing something like folding would require a central authority to double check that the calculations were correct. Hashing below a specific target is expensive as hell to do, but easy to verify (assuming the block contains the nonce in it) once it's done, so other clients in the swarm can verify legitimate blocks in the chain and decide on which one is longest and valid. It's my (admittedly very layperson) understanding that the computations used in folding don't fit this bill.

No legal precedent that I know of, AFAIK Bitcoins have never even been mentioned in a courthouse. I do know that a while back some redditor received 10 of an item when they'd paid for one, and someone was spouting off that in such a situation they're "a gift", but I didn't verify that.
All I meant by it was that it's not like a cheque (where you can put a stop payment on it if there's an accident) or a credit card (same). It's more like mailing cash in that if there's a mistake or the stuff disappears, you have (almost) zero recourse. 
But you're probably right either way... and I think we're all in agreement that this is a massively douchey thing to do ("isn't good faith" is a bit of an understatement). I guess we'll see if they do track him down and take him to small claims.

Yes, as I understand it mtgoxlive is based on a live websocket (why it only works in chrome), so those are the up-to-the-second order sheets. I think mtgox limits the order sheets outside a certain percentage of the last trade site, so you don't see orders where someone's trying to sell 1BTC for $75, and you don't see orders where someone's trying to buy 1000BTC for $1.
At the time I wrote this post, the highest buy order is about 16.77, and the lowest sell order is at 16.95. Move your mouse anywhere over the lines to see the actual prices/volumes at that point.

Legally, Bitcoins are like mailing cash. It's at your own risk, and it's known when you get into them what the deal is (unless you're a fucktard).
But while the person is probably (IANAL) not *legally* obligated to return them, it's a bit of a douche thing to do. I complained recently that one of the biggest issues facing Bitcoin is how it's seen from the outside as a den of "vipers and thieves" - the common conception is that Bitcoin is a haven for scammers and scumbags and nothing more. 
That's tragic really, but I guess Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad theory is correlated financially.

Not personally, no. I'm still cautiously optimistic Bitcoin will eventually make something of itself - people just have to understand this is a *giant* setback. I think we'll be lucky if it stays above USD parity in the short term, because the actual market activity for it is so tiny.
If Bitcoin goes the way of the Dodo, I'm personally done dabbling with cryptocurrency. I've had some fun, effectively traded services for games and other junk (using Bitcoin as an intermediary) but I'm not going to bother being an early adopter on something that's on equally flimsy grounds.
Bitcoin proper has a huge network effect that's going to be tough for any successor to duplicate - it's my pessimistic opinion we basically get one shot at this and that's it (which is why I hope it does recuperate, even if that means 2 years of a stable price under USD parity). If it goes tits up, well, we had some fun, we learned some things, and I feel genuinely sorry for anyone who lost a sizable amount of real money in the process.

That should be it. If you plug the Yubikey in and run Yubico's customizer, it'll give you the ID of it. IIRC it's 6 digits, and there's an A and a B slot, they correspond to the "login" and "withdrawal" slots (ie short + long press).
If you look in that file, if your ID is there, there will be two lines, one with an A and one with a B, use those to reset the Yubikey to the default configuration and then you can set it up on the cloud, or use it for PAM, or whatever.

That's the reason for the enforced transaction fee on really small amounts, and on coins that aren't matured very long. The idea is to make it cost prohibitive - all you'd be doing is giving lots and lots of 100ths of BTC to the miners who solved the blocks you shit all over.


The protocol is designed such that if you were to spend lots of money on a fast enough cluster to attack it, your financial returns are better just playing by the rules. That wouldn't stop someone who simply find's Bitcoin's existence unpalatable, but it would stop people who are financially motivated.

Because if you're calculating the ROI of building a mining rig, and you exclude paying for utilities - what happens if say, you're mining in a dorm room and you blow a 40 year old circuit? Then once the electrician points out what happened, your housing people tell you to cut that shit out?
If you've factored utilities into your calculations, you could put it in your parents house, pay them for the power usage, and keep going. If you haven't, your time to break even probably just shot clear out on the horizon.
Same goes if you're at your parents house mining - you're mining, spewing out Bitcoin like it's no one's business... Mom gets the utility bill for that month and starts pushing the power button on your computer when you leave each day?
It's just idiotic to not factor a real cost in just because it's not realized in your current situation. Essentially you're banking on that the person paying the utility bill is going to keep absorbing the rising costs for you - that's not smart ground to start anything.

You'll probably have to contact their support - what's the block# it showed up in? I'm not sure if they wait for 6 confirmations before they credit your account or not, but that might be why.
Failing that, if it's in BlockExplorer, that means it's in the block chain which means they have the BTC if that's an address that belongs to them. So they're the ones to get in touch with, it could be a glitch their end.

Bitcoincharts has a bunch of volume-weighted price averages, which you can access programmatically via [JSON]( Those are probably your best bet in terms of a stable price.
As far as addresses, what you'll want to do is give each customer their own address (or maybe one for each order, depending on your software) then you just wait for X confirmations before you ship out the goods. 
Remind them to attach a transaction fee, or else (as with the case of a redditor I sold a service to, who thought he'd attached a tx fee but actually didn't according to block explorer) they could be waiting a *long* time for the first confirmation.

The problems with your assumptions hinge on this group right here. First of all, miners sit on a huge spectrum of profitability. The kid with the pile of GPUs he's had sitting around for a year and "free" (to him, anyway) electricity isn't going to have the same profitability requirements as the guy who's just dropped $1500 on an order from Newegg and pays for his own electricity.
I fully understand that everyone has their price, I'm just pointing out that for many people already in the game, their price is lower than yours would be if you went to build a new mining rig now. If you already have the equipment, or if you're planning on buying the GPU or whatever anyway, for other reasons - you literally have nothing to lose, you can subsidize the equipment and make out like a bandit. If you're putting yourself in a hole to get mining gear, don't depend on Bitcoin prices to get you back out of it.
You're also completely discarding the fact that there are a lot of early-adopters sitting out there on thousands of coins, and it is almost a certainty that at least one of them will get sick of waiting at some point and start cashing out. If they do it in a sane way (ie, not putting a dark pool order in with a limit of $10 to sell everything) then the best case scenario is that unless a suitably matched buyer enters the market at the same time you'll see at best a price ceiling and at worst a gradual decline.
Combine that with the usual advice of "mine, baby, mine!" it's pretty easy to see why everyone's profitability numbers decline over time. The math when I bought my 5770 said it should have paid for itself in 10 days time, and it took closer to three weeks once the difficulty went up and the price went down. If your numbers are turning up that you can expect to recoup your costs after *months*, you're playing with fire.

Personally, our small Mumble provider is experimenting with accepting bitcoins and we've already taken one payment so far. We're keeping the amounts (compared to our USD income) small so we can afford to eat the loss if the BTC suddenly becomes worthless overnight - I don't believe in it *that* much to sink any real stake in our livelihood in it.
I'm probably going to spend the BTC we've accepted at some point in the near future on advertising or something else... because honestly the way I see it I would rather have gotten and spent something that appreciates 10,000%, than to be stuck holding on to something that depreciates to near worthlessness.
I'm a firm believer that unless people actually move it for actual trades, it's not going to go anywhere (despite how much the hardcore forum members might insist it's a worth store of wealth). I don't want to hoard our BTC, in the hopes that other people do it, while everyone else is doing the same thing I am. There are more important things in life than making easy profit, so I'll do my part to keep them moving.
If it turns out that the Bitcoiners were right, and the BTC becomes worth something like $1,000 in the next decade, well... it'll be no different to having bought a classic car when they weren't a classic, and junked it because it broke down. Life's full of regrets over materialistic shit.

Unless your rig is completely wind/solar/tidal powered, power is never free. Calculate power usage into your profitability estimations anyway, even if you're not the one footing the bill at the present time. Calculate at 11.5c/kWh if you're not the one paying the bill and you don't know what your region's rate is.
It's like figuring out if delivering pizzas is good money when you're not the one paying for gas - only a complete dumbshit wouldn't calculate the cost of gas into the equation.
As far as being worth it - if you're already building a gaming rig, then the only questions are:
a) is sticking to nvidia worth what you could potentially make? (If you're already going to go with AMD, this is a moot point)
b) are you willing to put the wear and tear on your GPUs for the money you could potentially make?

Problem is in Bitcoin client, not Tor. It's not an immediate unmasker, but it is an information leak and in the case of Tor,that's completely unacceptable.
It's a small chink in the armor of anonymity, but Todamont is still not entirely wrong. He's also not entirely right, I make absolutely no effort to hide my transactions and absolutely none of the websites that show IP addresses associated with transactions have ever got my IP right.
I think the best way to view Bitcoin's anonymity is in the most pessimistic way possible: If you're relying on tracking down someone who robbed you, assume it's completely anonymous. If you're relying on it being anonymous so you can sell kiddie-porn, enjoy prison.

Because for the truly paranoid, any time Bitcoin's hashrate isn't growing, it represents a window for evil people to catch up. If some new fancy tech comes out that would *allow* people's hashrates to double (if only they bought this fancy tech), then theoretically the Bitcoin network's hashrate has to double too in order to maintain the same level of security from outside threats.
This observation is enormously simplified of course, as not only does that improved hashing tech need to be real, it also needs to be available in the amounts some evil entity would require in order to be able to attack the block chain (simply put even if the NSA did have a mandate and a blank check to obliterate trust in Bitcoin, they would have a rough time buying up the processing power to do it).
But the simplistic theory is that if Bitcoin's standing still, it's going backwards.

MtGox is used as *the* indicator of value for most people, particularly those in the USA. It's also where most of the significant volume takes place, if I understand correctly.
I like Tradehill - apart from the fact their API is missing some critical stuff, for some reason I just like their site. If you dig up someone's referral number they knock 10% off your trade fees too. I'd post mine, but then I'd feel like a shill.

I wouldn't worry about it too much, like most any other time Bitcoiners (or anyone, really) talk about charity pledges, it's mostly a bunch of talk. I proposed this idea as a way to get people to actually do some good, rather than simply pledge and then hold that good to ransom in exchange for some kind of want or desire.
I figured a big list of Redditor donations on your site, followed by the actual cash donations to charity, would get some real attention... but apparently everyone just wants to be charitable with everyone else's money instead. ;)

Taken directly from the PHP site, and I'm half asleep so pardon me if it's incorrect, but it's basically something like this:
    $mysql-&gt;query("SELECT District FROM City WHERE Name = '" . mysql_real_escape_string($city) . '";"); 
    // query and userdata are mixed - forget to escape the string, and you are vulnerable to SQLi
    if ($stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare("SELECT District FROM City WHERE Name=?")) { // query is parsed at this point.
         $stmt-&gt;bind_param("s", $city); // user data is inserted here
The idea is that in the second one, the user data is nowhere near the query when it's parsed.

This is the second test that I bothered paying attention to - they "bubbled!" to $9 a few weeks ago, then flopped back to $5 or so before starting to rise again. I'm sure it probably happened below USD parity too, I just wasn't paying much attention (so much so that I was offering $1USD well after they'd hit $2, haha).

As they fucking well should. It amazes me that some folks out there consider inflation to be "theft", but think nothing of piling miners onto the PCs of unsuspecting people. It gives a bad name to everyone.
Don't mine on your work PCs. Don't mine on your school PCs. Don't mine in your dorm - your electricity isn't "free", it's covered in your dorm expenses. In fact, unless you're on purely-renewables, if your electricity is "free" don't mine, period. It's not "free" electricity, all you're doing is a convoluted scheme to extract money from the pocket of whoever's paying that electricity bill.

I'm pretty sure it's mentioned in the whitepaper that the ledger only needs the start and end of each coin's transaction history - it's possible to prune out the middle transaction.
The current client doesn't do that, but it could easily do so - then your only real problem is the divisibility of coins causing headaches.
It's also mentioned in the paper that the rate the blockchain can be expected to grow is far outpaced by increases in storage and bandwidth - then again I don't think Mr Nakamoto saw what goes on with broadband in the USA.

That would imply the bank has some benefit from you locking those Bitcoins away - they really don't, as far as I can tell.
The only ways I can see a Bitcoin Bank actually turning a profit from people storing their coins there are:
a) You loan them out - possibly to something like CampBX, so they can sell shorts. I know almost nothing about selling shorts, but I believe this is risky for the person loaning the coins out, at least so far as they've been implemented in Bitcoin. Also, given the majority of the Bitcoin community's hatred for fractional reserve banking, I really don't think this idea would fly very far.
b) You operate a mixer, charging people for using the mixer - possibly a premium because their funds are mixed with "legitimate" people, so even the proof that you used $mixer is not in and of itself damning in the slightest. You pay the "legitimate" coin account holders a share of the fees you earn by mixing.
Making a profit from a small-time mining operation + ads? Not seeing it.

As said in the other response, SHA256 is probably overkill considering that all you need is a deterministic large number to iterate through. You don't need a 256-bit number to do that when a 32-bit unsigned integer will give you enough wiggle room that unless you have more than two billion entries there's still no way of guessing where it'll land.
There is nothing inherently security related about the process of determining winners I described above that necessitates SHA256 or higher. The input to the hash function is not a secret and it does not matter how long the output takes (as there is no advantage to a player to be able to calculate the result faster).
FWIW your airliner analogy is doubly idiotic because they don't fill airliners up all the way for most trips anyway.

That's also not taking into account you're essentially using a decentralized currency so you don't have to trust anyone, then you're trusting the operators of these services to not screw you over themselves.
It's not a real likelihood or anything (hopefully), but it's just an ironic twist. IMHO a better solution would be namecoin resolution in the clients, and namecoin addresses shortening (namecoin does not have to be used for DNS).

Pretty narrow window to do that isn't it?
According to the charts, at least 261kBTC went through at $0.01 from this one sell order. Even discarding the other orders for a second, doesn't that mean that you would need to buy up more than 261kBTC for less than $2,160 in order to turn a profit? Now I gather that obliterating the buy side of the order book has to net you at least some USD profit, but I can't imagine that even with the panic selling that there's enough volume on the bid side of things to make this worthwhile.
Especially considering the price rebounded before plummeting again, so timing the buys on something like this would be amazingly difficult.

These days it's really the only way to keep it from being a giant lottery, so I think they're a good thing. I wish people would stop being fixated on deepbit though - it's popular enough, the smaller pools could use some love too.
IMHO, now that the server issues are sorted out, anyone who's a Redditor and mining for a pool other than MtRed probably needs their head read. It's rapidly approaching the point (in terms of hashing power) where payouts are going to get a lot more frequent, they seem pretty responsive to suggestions.

It really depends what the markets do. If you want to participate in a market that has volume, and the vast majority of dumbshits decide to go back to using MtGox then that's where you'll have to go.
I kinda like TradeHill's site, though I'm not really under any illusions about their security (I believe their site is written under django, which means probably most of the really idiotic shit is blocked off for them, but that's probably about it) - but the fact is that even with MtGox being down they're still operating at what... 10% of MtGox's volume?
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:56:19


As I understand it, yes. If you discard what you spend on fees, and then give yourself a long enough timeline, you will make a certain amount of BTC per MH/s, and that's that. I think if the timeline is long enough to include solo mining, that's equal as well.
So as I understand it, given that MTRed is fee-free (though they do keep the transaction fees associated with blocks they find, and you have the option to donate a percentage), there's really no reason why any Redditor who's mining shouldn't be part of the MTRed pool unless they absolutely have to have that small payout every single day.


Periodically, mostly to play with the performance of different mining software and check stuff out. My hashing performance is awful, I have a cheap Nvidia GPU. I'm trying to use Bitcoin mining as an excuse to buy a bitchin' GPU, but money's a bit tight right now.

It's different because if (and it's still a really huge "if") Bitcoin becomes useful like people think it will, even buying in at $30, $50, or $100 is still going to net long-term investors exponential profits.
Look, it's called speculation for a reason. It could conceivably be worth 10% of the market Paypal processes and it'd still be huge. It could also fizzle out, and the poor bastards who invested in at $30 will never see any of that money anymore.
I'm optimistic it'll go back up on monday, but we'll wait and see. I don't really have anything invested in it - I thought it was a nifty payment system that might give our small company a leg-up, but response to it was extremely minimal. I bought a sensible GPU and it's 90% paid off - I could manage the rest myself, but it'd be cool if Bitcoin paid it all off and made some profits.
I had some good fun pretending to be a day-trader as well, and made a reasonable percentage of profit (with my low "buy in" though, obviously I didn't make much, if it wasn't fun I wouldn't keep doing it).
But saying shit like "it's a scam" like it's a foregone conclusion that it's all going to go bad is dumb, and short-sighted. Yelling out "crash" every time the market dips like the goons have been is dumb as fuck - keep yelling out "crash" and sooner or later it might happen... but that doesn't mean you called it if you were wrong 3 or 4 times before.
TL;DR: If you don't trust it, don't invest in it. Fortune favors the bold.

If I was going to store $250k in Bitcoin, the wallet wouldn't be online. It's already happened that people lose significant amounts of Bitcoin from their wallet - not because of a bug in the software (that we know of yet), but because they kept the wallet open on the machine they use everyday and get boned by malware.
For some reason when people have high balances they like to sit and look at them... to roll around in their virtual riches Scrooge McDuck-style, if you will. These people are morons, and in that sense you're right: they'll be separated from their wealth eventually, it's inevitable.

Obviously you can hope that Bitcoin7 still use that address (and that they don't purge addresses after a while) and that they'll send them back. But that's not what the question is implying, the question is implying if there's any way to retrieve Bitcoins sent to the wrong address (as in, without the cooperation of a person who may or may not control that address).
In that respect, if it were possible, Bitcoin is useless.

See? See how that works?
The money in my bank account has generally, my entire life, come solely from a week or two's hard work. When Paypal first started, most of the money in there for the first couple years was pretty much just "tips" from someone for helping them out with a server issue that I didn't really expect to get paid for, so it's easy to write it off in my mind as not-actual-money.
Now, Paypal/Google Checkout represents the majority of my hard work, and what's interesting is that in the extremely rare event I carry actual cash, I'm more apt to spend it on complete bullshit that I wouldn't whip out my debit card for.

Transactions 0.01 and smaller require a fee, to make DoS of the network by flooding tiny transactions more expensive. The next version of the client will support a TX fee of 0.005 (I believe that's the right figure), but there will still be a fee for any transactions below a certain amount (I think it's still staying at 0.01BTC), or I believe any transactions where you're sending immature coins.
@_date: 2011-06-09 13:57:50
I think with the current difficulty, you want at least 1GH/s to mine without a pool. If I'm not mistaken, that's at least three~four expensive GPUs - but I could be wrong on that. 
According to the mining calculator, 1GH/s would put you around 1 block/month on average... so as long as you're willing to stick with it for the long haul, you could do okay. You could also go quite some time with absolutely zero return.

The actual number of people with listening ports on the network is abysmally low... it's one of the reasons UPNP is enabled by default, to try bring that number up.
I think the client needs a window where you can configure peers by hand, but you can instruct the client to not connect to any but an explicit list of trusted peers - for example run a wallet-less peer on your router box, another on your desktop and then daisy chain them to the laptop that you're loading your riches onto to make one transaction.
There's lots of approaches that make it pretty damn hard to get robbed with Bitcoin - the problem is that they're all so goddamn convoluted.

Even then it has to be a pretty good sized botnet. You can't really compete if you're in your own pool with a measly 100MH/s, and pools like Deepbit are getting better at blacklisting accounts that look shifty.

This can't be overstated enough - if you're calculating the profitability of a mining rig you don't yet own, *do not* use the current difficulty in your calculators... calculate based off the estimated difficulty next increase (which at time of writing is in about an hour) - and even then understand that it's a fuckin' guess.
It's backwards to think that difficulty drives price - price drives new miners, thinking it's profitable, which then pushes difficulty up. The miners invariably respond by ramping up their asks, but that doesn't imply there's going to be people ready to buy at the new price. All it takes is one desperate miner who would rather be holding USD instead of BTC and the price stays where it's at.

MtGox just posted a statement saying that this one account was hacked, and that they're reversing all the transactions that happened (my guess is they'll eat the $1,000 in BTC that was removed themselves).
So I think it's safe to say that this was simply a hacker fucking up the market, and not some high-stakes market run.
FWIW, I'm pretty sure you can pull what you're talking about much cheaper... if you simply have a bunch of big buy orders staggered around that people think are "support", but which you're sure will never get filled... then you buy down to them while simultaneously removing your own buy orders, others see the quick movement and the disappearing buy orders and panic. I'm quite sure it's been done on MtGox before and using substantially less than 261kBTC.
Think about that number again for a sec... $261kBTC, for which they took in ~$2,160 - the market would have to rebound in a hell of a way, and they would have to dominate the rush of sell orders (and there would have to be more than 261k in penny sell orders to begin with) just to break even.

As I understand it, the price is smoothed to the 24h average - which you are probably still right, is not really enough.
This is the reason that Kevin Day was able to withdraw ~600BTC rather than ~10,000BTC... the "average" price for the 24 hour period after that huge sell down to $0.01 was about $1.60 IIRC (check my math, it's entirely possible I have some of the details wrong).
But yeah, you're right on the money with lots of your points. Things like XSS and SQLi shouldn't even be an issue anymore, and it's a massive stain on the entire webdev industry that we even hear these initialisms in day to day security conversation anymore.

It's instant compared to ACH, but it's not instant compared to Paypal - depending on the amounts involved and how many confirmations you want to wait for, it might take some time. Getting a small transfer confirmed quickly is also occasionally a problem because of your next sentence:


Good luck getting a smaller (1~10BTC) transaction processed in a timely fashion for free. Attach a fee to it and you'll probably wait 10~20 minutes for the first confirmation, but go without a fee and it's possible you could be waiting overnight.

The funniest thing is the fast and loose moderation style of both here and BCT was because they wanted a "let the people decide, caveat emptor" approach to moderation.
Then when it's suddenly something Theymos is passionate about, the "moderation" comes out of the woodwork.

Yeah, I said this in the forum thread about it. Selling an asset (which at best is what the US ICE is going to view Bitcoin as, it's most likely not a currency from their perspective) is not the same thing as exchanging currency. Try fly in to the USA, Canada, etc, with 20 iPhones and say that you're going to sell them to support your stay and see how quickly your arse is back on a plane wherever you came from.
This article makes it appear even worse, even if you're participating in a "think tank" - if you're in any way compensated for this in the future, *that's work*. The more I read about this "fiasco" the more it just sounds like customs doing their bloody job *for once*.
Edit: For the people who can't fathom customs asking how much money you have: I flew into the USA pre-9/11. They asked me how much money I had, how I was supporting my stay. I told them I had about $150 in USD, and I had my bank account with a few thousand bucks on it. They didn't ask to see any statement or anything, *any* ATM card that'll work in the USA that you can show them and tell them some arbitrary figure that's on it will work (though again, I don't know how it is post-9/11).

If you're investing in GPUs now, I would advise you leave this out of your calculations. If it's not a good idea without you factoring in liquidating your equipment at the end, then it's not a good idea, period.
The reason? I can't count the number of people who say this, many of whom have 20, 30, or more GPUs they just bought. That's all well and good if Bitcoin's death is a slow decline into obscurity - people will back out of the market at different paces (some already are now, if you look at the marketplace forum, r/BitMarket, etc) and the cards will mostly hold their value.
If there's a massive crash in value and suddenly everyone tries to liquidate heavily used radeon cards, the idea that there will be enough gamers out there to soak up all the potential stock simply doesn't fly. If the shit hits the fan, the assumption that you can get 75%+ of your card's retail value back is a flawed one.
This is all irrelevant if you're optimistic to never have to cash those cards out, but I would definitely advise against building a contingency plan around "I can just sell the cards and get most of my money back".

Oh... I see what you mean - yeah, I've left my BTC in the exchanges at the moment just because I'm still screwing around playing the market. When I'm done playing, I'll export them all back out to my PC.
I don't like the idea of leaving BTC on someone else's server long-term. I don't think any of the e-wallets are insured or anything, and once you send BTC out it's irreversible. I trust my ability to keep a machine that's mostly-offline safe rather than instawallet/mybitcoin really.

To be fair, plenty of us "Bitcoiners" were saying it was going to go back down and that such prices were unsustainable. It's pretty elementary to see why: the network self-adjusts to mint 50 new coins every 10 minutes.
7200 coins every day, on average. Multiply that number by the price of coins, and that's how much money has to enter the market every day to maintain the same price (naively, we're ignoring such factors as people who mine and hold, as well as people who get fed up with the price not going "UP UP UP" and sell). It's pretty obvious to anyone who's not an idiot that even in the middle of the hype in June that we didn't have anywhere near $216,000 coming in every day.
The upshot to this is that as the price continues to come down, that 7200 BTC/day figure doesn't change either. That makes the price more sustainable the lower it goes.
I don't pretend to be an economist by any stretch of the imagination, but I almost feel like it's not done dropping yet. I am not convinced that everyone who invested when it was &gt;$3 has bailed out yet. As those people eventually give up hope that they will *ever* see the massive gains they'd hoped for, they'll exit the market to lick their wounds and dash the price some more.
From my perspective, Bitcoin is an interesting project, a fun toy, a nice potential payment system for merchants (though it's particularly unattractive to most buyers) - but a sound investment strategy it is not.

Because with credit card fraud, you almost always leave behind breadcrumbs that allow the person to find you and sue you - otherwise you can't really get any benefit from it and you're just fucking over the merchant/card processor.

I'd like to wish so, but I'm pretty sure it was just dumb luck. The turbulence with it going from ~$32 to $10 in a day? I managed to catch most every peak with a sell and every dip with a buy. I've started screwing myself over recently, buying when it dipped to $13 only to have it continue to $11, and I completely missed the $13 dip on Tradehill on Friday because I was expecting it to go lower over the weekend (in retrospect though, that was a bit of an understatement).
Buying back in at $13-something on Friday would have netted a pretty tidy profit, because one could have resold at almost $18 45 mins later. I think it was all beginner's luck though, I guess no suspenders, cigar and sports car for me. :(
TL;DR: It's pretty easy to make huge-percent returns "day trading" Bitcoin when you're only risking lunch money and you didn't even pay for the initial investment anyway.
Edit: Just figured out the disparity on my numbers - my initial investment was back when BTC was about $5, I just moved it over into Tradehill almost as soon as they started. I suppose if you quote the "initial investment" at the price it was when I put it into Tradehill, it's not nearly as impressive - but I think the volatility of BTC counts even though TradeHill wasn't up at the time, no?
Still though, depending on where the BTC lands (I'm foolishly holding one and a bit BTC right now), I started with $8 and ended up with over $70 when I decided to cash out most of it. I know I'm bad at math, but I'm pretty sure that's about 900%?

[This guy]( sells "mining contracts", where you don't actually rent the box, you rent the mining capacity. As far as I know, he handles everything - you turn over your money, and give him the address where the Bitcoins go.
I'm not sure how cost-effective it is over either a) setting up your own rig (at least you have a sweet gpu at the end of your mining run) or b) just outright buying BTC... but it's an interesting idea.

Bitcoin isn't taxless at all, and anyone telling you they're tax-free is full of shit.
If you get paid in Bitcoins, I gather most jurisdictions consider it barter income. Unless you live in a jurisdiction where barter income is tax-free, there is usually a system for working out the taxable portion of that barter income (which is then due in your country's currency).
Of course, given that it's pseudonymous you stand a reasonable chance of getting away without doing that. But there's a far cry between a truly tax-less income and simply operating under the radar and not paying taxes on it (which can be done very easily with USD if you operate entirely on a cash basis).
TL;DR: Tax-less aspect of Bitcoin is bullshit.

I guess I am a bit sour, because the whole idea comes across as someone who's either bullshitting, or if you're not, it's terribly poorly researched even before this Q&amp;A. How you could have that kind of money to invest, and basically start asking questions in public before knowing something as rudimentary as that you can't just throw hardware at it and mine thousands of bitcoins a day ad infinitum, I don't know.
The "free" power in particular rubs me the wrong way. Where the heck are you set up that you can feed and cool (napkin math, so I reserve the right to be way off, but I don't think I am) 25-50kW of machines, without any thought to the cost? If you can do it, that's awesome - but again I think the logical assumption for me is to assume that you don't quite get how much power the whole thing is going to draw.
As I said though, I don't think (even with it being in GBP) you're rich enough to win the race to the bottom in mining costs, so you'd better hope your numbers run so as your break even point comes in before someone else does. We're talking ASICs or at least bulk FPGAs running somewhere like Iceland, with ridiculously cheap power and easy cooling.
100k GBP would go even further at stabilizing the economy (being worth almost 2x the USD), so I really think that'd be your best bet - if there's a way you can figure out your optimal price point (so you're mostly invested by the time it starts to soar again, but don't risk running out of funds as if you do you're likely to lose everything) it's probably the safest bet on a bunch of really, really long horses.

Correct. I accept an offer for 6mbps ADSL with no quota, I should be able to use it.


Now you're getting it! I'm already paying for that capacity, and the argument was that they should be able to charge Netflix for it because Netflix makes up so much of the internet traffic.




Who are they going to switch to? Are you aware that in most of the USA, you have two or fewer broadband providers? Even at the modest definition of broadband, 4mbps, almost 20% of the nation has exactly one company to purchase broadband from. At 25mbps, it's over half the nation either cannot get it, or can only get it from one company.

Someone's got to do it. I didn't get into Bitcoin as early (it was around 40~50c when I first looked at it) and I didn't get my hands on any until they were around $7, but I've not hoarded any. I don't regret a single thing I've bought with it.
I guess I don't really believe opportunity cost applies in all these kinds of situations - it's like saying "if I'd saved my allowance from when I was 5 until when I was 18 I could buy a ferrari when I got my license"... it's pointless financial masturbation that holds absolutely no weight in the real world.

Could be five years, and the bottom of the crash could be higher than the price is today. It's possible there could never be another event significant enough to call a crash! Worst of all, if you wait for the crash to dive in, what if the next crash is significant enough to override BTC's network effect?
Selling your BTC and/or waiting for the crash is betting against the lunacy of thousands of people with a tenuous grasp of economics and monetary policy. I've done it, twice, and lost out both times because I underestimated how far it'd go.

CampBX looks neat, but it's only operating on the test network right now. I like the approach - build a testnet exchange and let people hack on it first before opening it to the public.
My reservations about it though are that it's in the USA - I was under the impression you had to register as a money transmitter to operate a Bitcoin exchange above-the-board in the USA. There's no mention of any of that stuff, or what they're doing to abide by regulation.
They also mention FDIC like it's some kind of thing that's relevant to Bitcoin exchanges - I'm not really super familiar with FDIC, but I can't see from my weak understanding how the fuck it applies to protecting people's BTC/USD, beyond if the banks the exchange happens to store USD in go bust.
I feel like these exchanges that come in with lots of promises about professionalism but then the answers start getting shadier and shadier as you dig are going to be the hands that choke the fuck out of Bitcoin - by the time we're done with all the half-truth answers no one's going to trust an exchange at all.

Saying Bitcoin will be more secure and more accessible is like saying well have a car that runs on water. 
Sure, it will improve financial accessibility in places that are currently banking backwaters, but they will still account for a very small percentage of the financial world. 
At the moment it is still difficult for the average user to store BTC they plan on using, securely. At this stage it will forever be a chicken-and-egg problem because of how easy it is to make off with someone's coin and for them to never see it again - you have to trust that the manufacturer of the device you store them on doesn't want to fuck you. 
I think Bitcoin is neat but without some hand-wavy "oh the solution to that problem will be invented any day now" I just can't see how you can hold such a position. 
I think bitcoin will remain the wild west of money because it makes more sense that way. The only people who will take up the risk will be those of us financially or ethically motivated to do so - average Joe who can afford to let his bank make copious amounts of money off his back may not ever give a shit.

The primary problems with Bitcoin that come to mind, in my humble opinion:
* Proof of work sucks, hard. But at this stage, nothing better has come along that actually ticks all the boxes and passed muster by the world's cryptologists. Proof of work is a massive use (I'll refrain from saying "waste" for the sake of neutrality) of energy but it's the best we've got, as far as I'm aware.
* The distribution algorithm is hair-brained - the idea of copying gold and the idea of giving it to miners only are both problems that an ideal system would not have. But an inflation curve that roughly emulates gold and paying the miners to do the proof of work are basically the only currently workable solutions to the problem. They're not *great* solutions, but all the others are worse. Ideally, inflation and deflation would scale with economic activity so we wouldn't be sitting at $300 18 months after being 4x that - if you figure out a distributed, trustless, deterministic method to solve that problem are you are going to make billions.

That would actually be a great system because it would eventually encourage bidding on a spot in the block chain, as opposed to the silent auction we have now.

But don't you think you're being just a tiny bit overly optimistic about your fellow man thinking that we will all realise the problems with fiat currency in a short enough timeline for Bitcoin to take over? 
Or, given past performance, do you not think it more likely that we will just plod along with the same system because it's familiar and makes is feel safe? That the devaluing of the USD could continue unabated for the next two hundred years and possibly the majority do not ever give a shit beyond the occasional whine of "back in my day this only cost a couple bucks"?

Just to reiterate this guy's point - sometimes with these long blocks, for some psychologically fucktarded reason I wind up hopping pools to somewhere else (usually deepbit).
When you average out everything I do for the week though, I'm right where I should be on MtRed. Sure we've had some 24h+ blocks, but we've also had a couple sub-20m blocks too. If I'm not mistaken we're like 1/20th the size of deepbit, so it stands to reason the variance is going to be pretty crazy.
I've come to the conclusion the best thing to do is just stop looking at it - unless the pool's hashrate tanks to the point where it never finds a block, you're almost certainly better off just staying put and riding out the tough blocks.

How are the margins on your services? I'd be very concerned that accepting Bitcoins could eat up any tiny margins you might have (I know for a fact without a fuckton of startup capital there's very thin margins on gameservers).
It's been pretty stable the last week or two, barring a dip on friday which I *think* was simply people like me trying to short the "typical weekend slump" (which so far didn't really happen in any big way this weekend). But if you'd accepted BTC in that short period where it was $30~32 and not liquidated it immediately, you might hate life right now unless your margins are fat enough to absorb that loss.
Any time you're holding BTC at all right now, you're pretty much speculating - and IMHO that includes the hour or so you have to hold it while it transfers to you and to an exchange so you can sell it. So the real question is can you afford to speculate with a portion of your income?

They represent the order sheet. The orange line is buy orders, the blue line is sell orders. The higher up the Y axis you go, the more BTC has to move in order for the market to reach the given price.
From those graphs you can allegedly figure out the momentum - I think it's supposed to be a flat horizontal line means prices could move fast with some big trades, where as an almost vertical line means prices would probably move much slower.
I'm still learning how this whole thing works though - it's just a fun game for me because I don't really have anything invested in it - so I highly recommend you don't take anything I've said here without a grain of salt. :)

Not likely. If the BTC seized were actually entered as evidence, I think they'd have to hang on to it until the trial was completed. If they simply seized it via civil forfeiture, the BTC is legally theirs even if they never actually charged Ulbricht.
It's a fucked up system, but it happens all the time in the USA. You take a fat wad of cash across state lines to buy a car, cops see your plates and pull you over. "Oh this looks like drug money" and they never even charge you - the police department just keeps the cash because it's good money.

I'm not exactly a libertarian, but I actually think the bitcoin ecosystem would be really interesting if everyone you traded with felt morally justified to just keep your coins if they found them traced to stolen coins. 
The specifics would be tough to nail down but it'd provide a pretty good incentive for people to do due diligence, and a massive disincentive for people to steal. 
It'd be hilarious too. Not saying is a good idea, just that it's an interesting one.

Sure old white money isn't going to fuck around with truecrypting their wallet on a USB stick and that's bad for markets, but I still don't think the entire market needs to freeze up and have it's balls shrink back into it's abdomen every time some kid ignores the best practices for "savings accounts" that have been on the Wiki since before the BTC was worth anything.

I'm not the person you're responding to, but I don't think you answered their question. Without downloading OB and trying it, just from looking at [their guide for vendors]( it looks like you can specify one shipping cost for domestic, one for international. Considering the difference in cost to ship to say Australia versus just about anywhere else, it seems like there's a fair bit of padding required in your pricing to make sure you don't get hosed on shipping to a foreign customer.
For example eBay lets you - as far as I'm aware - specify the weight of an item and then uses USPS's API to get an exact shipping price to the customer. They also let you combine orders to ship them together, somehow, but I'm not familiar with how that works. At the moment it appears from a cursory look that OB doesn't let you do any of that, but if it does, I think that's what people are wondering.
Edit: Sorry, I forgot about flat-rate shipping - I'm guessing that's what you're using? Flat-rate boxes, and using that for your international prices?

Other than removing rights-of-way for cabling (which is a patently terrible idea) there's not going to be much you can do to reward smaller companies by reducing regulations.
I think we'll just have to agree to disagree, and note that in no shape way or form did I form my opinion because "the side [I'm] against" is for it.
I came to my conclusion because asking companies like Netflix to pay more money for "omg all the bandwidth they use" is bullshit because I'm already (in theory, in non-oversold-oversubscribed shitheap services) already paying for that capacity.
Broadband companies have had almost two decades to get their shit together, selling us these magical fast connections on the hopes that no one would ever use them to capacity. Now people are, they cried unfair and let it get so bad that for most people regulation is the only solution.
Not all regulation is bad, I just hope the youngsters who rallied behind network neutrality will keep the same fervour should the regulation turn bad.

Touche on the 2.5B unbanked, but I can't help but wonder if the scenarios that led to those in the western world getting unbanked are actually helped that much by Bitcoin. At the root, yes bitcoin will let them transact. But it won't stop them shooting their own foot off by any means. 
To address your other points, Bitcoin has been invented, but solutions to its problems are, as admitted in this thread, still forthcoming. No explanation whatsoever on how we'll maintain trust of our devices during that awful time between Bitcoin becoming mainstream and starving the beasts. And that's just one of the problems bitcoin needs to solve if it's going to be the dominant currency.
You also provide no explanation on how it's easier for average Joe - I think in some circumstances Bitcoin is easier, in some it's substantially more difficult. But hey, at least when given an easier alternative, average Joe will jump on it! 
Suggesting that it's easy enough to store Bitcoin securely, just use coinbase: LOL 
A part of me would really like to see Bitcoin succeed in at least some meaningful way - then again my requirements for "meaningful" are pretty low. If the inflation suddenly stopped tomorrow so we would have a pretty fair chance at it not devaluing, it works. You can use it for real transactions, and it's fairly easy to get local currency back out in most places. I would argue it's already moderately successful. 
But that by no means makes it inevitable Bitcoin will take over and be a dominant currency.
TL;DR I think Bitcoin is pretty neat, warts and all. Ignoring the warts doesn't make it neater though.

You can see the inputs that went into the transaction that was paid to you.
It's a bad idea to consider it (or them) a "from address" because you can't assume the payer has access to it. Could be a third party wallet, a coinjoin output (I think?) or their client could be set up to empty then burn addresses after a single use. Because "from address" or "sender address" implies these things are possible, it's not really correct to call them the same. 
You can't even guess a payer from the change address, because in addition to the above fact, they may have elected to donate the change to a third party (particularly if it's a small amount).

As I said earlier, if I'm on a list it certainly hasn't inconvenienced me in any way. I've been through two immigration processes, passed four background checks and I still qualify for a firearms license.

Pretty much. 
I mean yes, Bitcoin will lower some barriers if it's widely accepted. Migrant workers sending home cash is a big one. If there is a place in the country they're working where they can buy Bitcoin, and a place where their families can sell it in their home country, Bitcoin will be a good thing as far as that particular instance of "economic justice" goes.
But in terms of actual "economic justice", that is to say a world where hard work and dedication will get you ahead - it's just as seedy as any other capitalist system, and in many cases more so. 
That's not really a fault of Bitcoin per se, as it's not really part of the design criteria for it to solve that problem, and in fact with things like the distribution method it's effectively conceding ground on that front because there really isn't a better way to distribute coins in a decentralized fashion.
It's just a mistake to believe that "money of the people" like Bitcoin is going to result in any form of justice, because like all the systems that came before it some people are more equal than others.

Sort of. There's a current number of atomic units (satoshis) that the existing software can't go below. 
We could double the size of the integer that stores this unit, then change the multiplier to keep the market cap the same (since no one will ever go along with a Bitcoin fork that adds more coins as that'd send the value of each coin into a crater it'd never come out of). That would be a hard fork, meaning everyone needs to coordinate updating (though it's worth pointing out that some devs are far cleverer than I, and perhaps it could be done differently), but that would exponentially increase the divisibility of each coin.
The problem is that making the integer that stores these values larger would mean larger transaction sizes (in KB), and low value transactions are considered non-useful already - try send some dust without a fee that's a significant portion of the value and see if it makes it into a block. Without absolutely gargantuan blocks, we've already got more divisibility than we can reasonably use.
So yes, practically there's a limit to divisibility of Bitcoin, and in some cases it's above a Satoshi. I'm not sure if lightning network or any of the other cool stuff people are working on will change that.

A UNIX-like OS wouldn't have fixed this. The real problem is that medical gear is built, supported on one OS, then as the rest of the world leaves that OS behind, the manufacturers of the medical gear aren't forced to update the software because they want you to buy the newest piece of shit.
Old OSes (and not just old Windows OSes) appear in the infosec industry all the time in markets like health services, industrial machines, and so on. Anyone who says "hurr durr, should have upgraded or patched" has obviously never worked in such an environment.
If you honestly think a network full of outdated UNIX-like machines (pick any UNIX-like flavor, I don't give a shit, for the sake of this argument they're all alike, outdated is outdated, unsupported is unsupported) wouldn't get owned on a regular basis you're sadly mistaken.

I've went looking for his platforms to begin with, because almost from the start out looked like he was going to be the Republican nomination, and both the Democratic options are far too divisive to make a counter, in my humble opinion.
The problem is much of his platform is vacuous bullshit. He's going to make America great again, he's going to restore respect for the USA, there's no one bigger for Israel out bigger for the military than him. No indication he actually has any idea what the fuck he's talking about, just a bunch of big idea sound bites.
His ideas on encryption, free speech, etc are all pretty whacky, like someone who hasn't thought more than ten minutes on the subject. I'm pretty sure he's not as pro-2A as he makes out either. Feel free to link to a substantial policy document - would prefer no videos because I'm on mobile, but if that's all there is I'll put up with it (though a candidate who's words are only in video format is worrying).
I didn't and don't dismiss him at all - on the contrary, I think he's most likely the next POTUS, all I meant was that anyone in another country, particularly one tied to the USA as much as mine is, who thinks the idea is just funny isn't really paying attention. I think he's terrifying. Hilary is very much the devil we know.
I might be wrong, and he might turn out great for the US, just be a diplomatic rain man no one saw coming... But that wouldn't really be funny. And if my gut is right and he turns out bad for the US, it certainly won't be funny at all, for anyone.

My point is that Bitcoin exchanges haven't, for the majority of their operating time, proven themselves trustworthy. Yet for some reason, there's still huge numbers of people who leave currency (both BTC and others) on exchanges. 
The fact that you think exchanges are in any way forced to maintain 100% reserves when there's swathes of people content to leave not-insignificant funds on there, and when quite a few people are perfectly content to put up with withdrawal times in the *weeks* is frankly fucking adorable.

You're being retarded here. I didn't say (or mean to imply) that inflation is good. What I meant to say is that in any sound, modern monetary system you want to keep the money supply roughly in-sync with the demands of the market. Most countries *do* like to keep a modest amount of inflation because it promotes investment.
What you're thrilled to death about is essentially throwing the baby out with the bath water and using a system of inflation that is deterministic, but completely unable to react to the demands of the market. While this means, as long as BTC demand keeps rising, that there is no state to "steal" your worth out from under your mattress...
...What you replace it with is day traders who can steal the worth out from under your mattress instead. You just aren't mad because instead of the government doing it "at gunpoint", the private traders are doing it "fair and square".
My point all along is that based on my understandings of the Bitcoin whitepaper, I seriously like to think that if Satoshi could have imagined a less crazy way to implement inflation (using the term here to simply mean increasing the money supply, not decreasing each unit's worth) it probably would have been so. There's not (in my humble opinion) a decentralized way to do it, which is why the system works the way it works.
But you guys shout it from the roof tops like it's some sort of golden invention. It's simply a kludgy way of doing things because there's no better way without compromising what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin - it's not a feature, it's a side-effect.

You do realize that the injection of bitcoins into the network is scheduled to grind to a halt slowly over the coming decades, right? The analogy to gold during the gold standard is disingenuous.
The deflation thing sucks, but it's necessary. 
This is what bugs the shit out of me. It's not a feature, it's pretty much the only way Satoshi could deterministically ensure they'd be valuable in the future, which is, in turn, the only reason they're valuable now. I get that, and despite the deflation issue it's still cool as shit that something created from thin air and crypto is deemed valuable by a community.

So you only accept IOUs from an exchange you'd ordinarily buy BTC from (let's pretend it's Bitstamp, since they conveniently are already a Ripple gateway) - then you script your client to automatically redeem them when received.

For one and four, what part of "coming soon" is hard to understand? It's lame, but we have to wait for it. In the mean time we can play with the client and API if we want. The cost of buying enough XRP to boot strap an account is so miniscule that there's something wrong with you if you lose sleep should we all decide to walk away from it when the code is released because it's shit. 


I understand just fine, the way the argument is presented is flawed. OpenCoin runs all the validation nodes right now, but have you noticed I'm not saying I'm accepting payment by Ripple IOU yet? 
All I've said in this thread is if, when the server is open sourced, it does what OpenCoin says it will, this is going to be great. Guys like you come along acting like they shit in your cereal because it doesn't do it right now. 


And who cares if they inflate, barring people who are hoarding them, at no encouragement from OpenCoin? 
They're needed for anti-spam measures and that's it, if you bought in for 0.01BTC and they're worth a thousandth of that in a year's time, you still didn't get screwed unless you bought more than you need to operate an account. 


It's riddled with logical errors because the server hasn't been released yet - you get an opportunity to play around with a beta client while the kinks are worked out. And yet the entire premise of the article is that Ripple's finished and here's everything that's wrong with it. I guess you could say it's one giant error in that respect?
The article to me reads more like a "hit piece from someone with an agenda" - that's what Bitcoiners call articles like this right?

The Litecoin crypto is different (on purpose, so cpus have a chance) pretty much guaranteeing that the current ASICs can't be used for it. IIRC, it's also memory intensive, so unless you built ASICs stocked with RAM it'd never work (and even with RAM it may not be cost effective to develop).

I did respond to it. You said, and I quote:


To which I responded that:
a) many "poor" types actually have negative net worth, to which inflation is actually helpful (though not to their creditors)
b) even if you're "poor" but you have a few thousand in savings, the whittling away of it in your average savings account (arguably up to 3% a year, but probably not likely actually quite that high) is not likely to be your most disturbing economic factor.
c) In a currency like Bitcoin, the value removal from deflation is removed and replaced by monetary value due to market swings by people with the capital to invest to make money off the market. In the time we've been having this argument, a BTC holder's spending power has shifted upwards about 3% - it could have easily shifted downwards in that time too, and most poor people can't typically be choosy about when they pay bills.
You haven't responded to any of these points except to hurl insults, make judgments about my personality, provide vague non-arguments and a reference to an anecdote that you aren't willing to at least link to.

As I said though, in any future where BTC reaches critical mass (doesn't have to be the one world currency, just big enough where people stop saying "one day", let's say PayPal levels of volume) then even his plan will make him obscenely rich. So yours is higher risk, for an increase in reward that you quite possibly couldn't reasonably spend.

It's centralized **at the moment**, because the server software is as-yet unreleased. XRP is centralized in that OpenCoin control all of it, but the system is nowhere near securely in their hands.
It's my understanding that (and this is the silly part about people speculating on XRP) if enough of the network reaches a consensus to, more XRP can be minted. They can't control it forever, and I know I for one am not accepting payments from strangers/clients via Ripple until the server software's out there, but let's at least see where it's going before we call it "centralized", shall we?
Oh and all my other comments before? Pretend when I say "currency", I mean "equivalent to BTC"(1). XRP is never meant to be equivalent to BTC, precisely because we don't have concrete rules governing the supply. But no one should care, because as long as the value of XRP is above zero, it works as spam prevention, but it doesn't actually need to be worth "anything", just "something".

That's.... that's pretty much how taxes work now. Have you never filled out a tax return in your life?
Edit: that sounded too snarky, so I'll explain it from a US-centric perspective. You're an employee at Widgets Inc. You make let's say an average of $24k/year, and your average tax rate is 10%. Leave out children and deductions and shit because it gets pretty messy with those, this is a naive example.
When you start your employment, you fill out a W4 (I think, I've not been in the US in a couple years, may have the form number wrong), which is basically a set of withholding instructions. From these instructions, Widgets Inc calculates you'll owe about 10% in taxes on what they pay you. Your first paycheck comes around, it works out to about $460, so they take $46 out of that and send it to the government in your name. The numbers may be less because of things like standard deductions, etc.
At the end of the tax year, they send you a W2 (again, may have form numbers wrong) saying how much their books say they paid you, how much they withheld, etc. You take this information, put the numbers into your tax return and mail it off to the IRS. Depending on how far out the assumptions in your W4 were as to whether you owe the IRS, they owe you, or neither. Reasons the assumptions can be out is, for example, if you start working in the middle of the tax year, you're withholding tax as if you'd been working the entire year - because of your standard deduction a larger portion of your income will have been tax free, yet you've alread "paid" taxes on it. Anyway, that's how income tax basically works.
Sales taxes are basically the same way. You sell something for $10 in say, Sacramento, and you owe 85c in taxes to the state. Your accounting needs to take this into consideration, so you can cut a quarterly check to the state. But the government doesn't tell you how much you owe, they just set the rate.
If you're a guy selling Bitcoin badges at a flea market for cash, you can just "forget" to keep books. Or if you're really big time, you can keep two sets of books - one for yourself and one for the state. The state can come along and say "wait that does't sound right" and audit you, and if they catch you, imprison you.
**Absolutely nothing mentioned above is incompatible with Bitcoin**. The *only* part that Bitcoin is incompatible with is seizure, but they can't very well seize a pile of cash buried in the forest somewhere either.

I suggest you go read up an actual definition of "fraud", rather than what you think it means. It basically means deception for personal gain - there doesn't have to be a specific person that feels defrauded.


Personally? I don't actually give a shit either  way. I didn't say it's morally wrong, only that it serves no "legitimate" purpose (ie, in the eyes of the law). Law-abiding people (again, distinct from "morally/ethically right people") have no reason to launder income - the possible exception being someone like a prostitute or escort, but for the most part that doesn't really apply.
On the other hand mixing serves to anonymize funds - not legitimize. There's a huge difference and you're being intellectually dishonest equating the two.

You're effectively sanctioning criticism of your chosen currency, as you have not one valid complaint about it that doesn't apply to BTC as well, unless you count a) lack of reaching critical mass and b) that it's unoriginal, neither of which appear to be major points in the discussion.

They don't take your money, and you don't have to file to get it back. Your employer gives them your money. If you're self-employed, you're supposed to cut them a quarterly check. Lots of people don't. 
I think it's not technically speaking legal, but if you work for someone you can specify on your W4 that you have 7 kids and they will not withhold near enough taxes. You can spend that extra money every week and then have a huge bill come tax time.
I've predicted for a long time that any future where Bitcoin is even a reasonable sized tertiary market, forensic analysts for tax departments will be the new big thing. They don't need green lists to tax Bitcoin.

It's a long running joke that many people misunderstand freebsd branch names: you don't have to be on -current to stay up to date, and -stable isn't necessarily stable. 
There have been unsubstantiated claims made elsewhere that Netflix run it on their CDN, but I highly doubt that. The claim of "we track current" could easily just mean they track it in a dev environment and backport interesting bits.
Without looking at the code, I would almost guarantee that almost every bitcoin wallet gets its entropy from the kernel - maintaining enough entropy in userland would just be to much work and too fraught with potential danger when on most OSes a good source is provided handily (-current notwithstanding). I wouldn't put it past MtGox to have built an entropy generator in php though.

Absolutely, but I draw objections to the "closed source" thing - apparently people who have a copy of the server (I'm told BitStamp do) also have the source. Something can be open-source and not freely available, and the lack of free availability does not mean it's closed source. There's nothing *legally* stopping people who have it from making it public, they're choosing not to "for the good of the project" which does scare me a bit.
We're blurring the lines here admittedly, when one of the chief arguments *for* open source in financial systems is the ability for anyone to vet the rules. Us end users cannot, at this point in time, vet the rules of Ripple and therefore Ripple is not useful yet.
I think XRP to monetize Ripple was a shitty idea, but I also freely admit I can't really think of a better way to monetize it. OpenTransactions may catch up, or Ripple may be released and actually take flight before it does, with OT forever playing catch up despite the fact it may be a better system.
As the power of Mt Gox shows, fledgling currencies *need* the old financial system to bootstrap themselves, and old financial system institutions are far more likely to engage with something like Ripple, because they have an actual company to yell at if something goes wrong. The appeal of that is huge, which is why companies like Red Hat make money selling what's essentially free software to other companies.
But if I was at OpenCoin I'd be cracking the whip so hard to get this thing pushed out the door - it's doing quite well as far as people talking about it goes, but if that interest wanes and/or OT reaches a globally-useful state before Ripple is released, it's boned.

Both of these things are irrelevant for ROI.
Maximum ROI == buy BTC instead of a miner, and hope someone else does the mining.
It's cool if you want to do the mining and secure the network (fuck, someone's got to, same as someone's got to spend so I spent most of mine over the years). It's cool if you want to use a pool like Eligius and get *generated* BTC instead of buying BTC with a history on the market. It's even cool if you just like things that work hard and get hot sitting on your desk because it's your hobby.
But the moment you start talking about positive ROI on a miner these days, you're basically without exception a sucker. You can say ROI isn't important to you, and that's cool (as above), but if you say your miner's got a better ROI than just buying Bitcoin at market value, you're almost invariably a sucker.

Doing anything other than cutting a blood vessel open so it can't close itself is just a cry for help.

Coinbase are unique among exchanges in our ecosystem. MtGox are still around, and I'd be very interested to see an audit of their funds. I like BitStamp, but I have absolutely no way of knowing if they're operating full-reserve or not.
I am also, in no shape way or form, anonymous. 
Your recap is also in no way relevant to the thread at hand. You may be smarter than me (I do not consider myself a genius by any stretch of the imagination), but you're sure as shit not showing it in this thread. Here's a recap for you:
* OP says we should demand the same scrutiny of our exchanges and people who hold our funds (no matter how short term) that we do of banks.
* You say no, because fractional reserve means banks can afford to be better because they're stealing from the us.
* Others argue with you, with varying degrees of correctness and insults.
* You point out, not incorrectly (I don't think, I am unfamiliar with coinbase), that at least in terms of full-reserves coinbase gives you the information you need to scrutinize them.
* You recap your original point (?!) that if you can't weather the risk in Bitcoin, get out of it.
That's some scientific evidence of upper intelligence if ever there was some.

I did the same thing a little while back when I was juggling being broke in two countries at once. But I dispute the language "0 fees", because it almost sounds to an uneducated user as "zero cost". 
By adding a middleman currency to the equation, you will inevitably pay some difference than if you just converted from one currency to the other at nominal (non bank) exchange rates.
The difference is that in my case the fee was often negative (time the trade at the right time and you *make* money off the transfer), but there's still costs involved for someone.
It's absolutely useful for moving money from one country to another.

My guess is this is probably not FUD.
What this probably is, is some motherfucker cold-calling old people and getting them to wire money to Bitstamp, and then that person is cashing out via BTC.
Which if I'm right, could mean a fair amount of bank-related trouble incoming for Bitstamp when people eventually catch on. I hope they've made friends in some new banks already, because I kind of like their site.

You realize they take a percentage of both sides of the transaction, right (each user pays ~0.6%, one user in USD and the other in BTC)? It doesn't matter whether the price is high or not, the only thing that matters is the trade volume.
In fact if they're betting long on Bitcoin (and not liquidating the Bitcoin side of their fees immediately), lower unit price means more actual BTC going into their own wallet.
TL;DR: MtGox makes money off instability and high volume, not off a high price.

My point is, and always was, that inflation is not the thing that hurts poor people. It the grand scheme of things, out of all the financial worries that poor people have, saying "fuck the $1k I have in my emergency savings account now only buys $970 worth of shit this year".
As long as they were continuing to get raises to cover the cost-of-living increases, poor people aren't really affected by inflation. If you have enough money in cash where inflation is among your primary economic concerns, you're not poor.

I don't have a problem with a list of stolen coins, and when I receive some I will gladly provide any information on the payer **once I am delivered a court order**. I am not big on the anonymity idea, but I still respect my privacy policy and I refuse to update it so I can share your personal info just because 5 transactions ago your coins are stolen.
Where I draw the line is blacklists that say "we don't accept coins from these addresses" because of the fungibility thing - someone shouldn't be penalized for not respecting some list that no one has the authority to build. 
I do realize that the former idea will strike a bad note with some of the more libertarian types who will not want to be collecting information about everyone they transact with, but that's where my personal line in the sand is.

No it wasn't. If you mouse-over the balance where it says your fee was one XRP less, I'm pretty certain you'll see that it's actually rounded-down, and you'll see the actual amount (on one of my test accounts, I funded it with 200 XRP, sent one transaction and made one trust line, and I have 199.99998 XRP left, which shows as 199 in the balance boxes). It's one of numerous issues the client has with displaying actual information.
Which leads me to say that silly issues like this is why the server source isn't out in the wild, so that they have scores of nodes to update whenever there's a protocol-breaking issue.
I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not it's worth getting excited about the release of the server. For now, I've played with it and it's a pretty rad toy, and I think it's worth getting excited about if you actually care about the problems Bitcoin solves, and not just caring about Bitcoin because it's the horse you backed. 
I reserve final judgment for if it's any good until the server sources are released, but **RippleScam and the people who are touting it are invariably full of shit and misunderstandings**.

False. 1) As I said, you do not have to trust John, only the gateways that you accept IOUs from (John can send you IOUs he got from a gateway you also trust, without you trusting John). 2) Ripple do not have arbitrary control over all the "money", they only control XRP - you can argue that XRP is the only non-IOU money in the network, but the cynic in me thinks it's pretty much the worst currency on the network.
Of course right now something to the tune of 80~95% of the validation servers are run by OpenCoin and that's creepy, but I personally won't be using Ripple in any meaningful way until that's not the case regardless.
Once it's out in the open though, OpenCoin will have almost zero control over Ripple itself anyway.


Except OpenCoin are *not* the only people with access to the server software. BitStamp are apparently one of a few people with access to it. Why it's not been leaked when there can be absolutely zero repercussions for doing so (many of the parts Ripple is built on are GPL licensed) I don't know, but the fact is that I don't think there's a single part of your post that's wholly factual.

I don't think, given that GST is still due on barter transactions, that it matters what the ATO thinks of Bitcoin. I'm not an accountant, but it seems to me like when you accept BTC in trade for something, you owe GST on the fair market value of the goods/BTC. 
Then when you liquidate them, you may incur capital gains/losses, as well as additional GST. I suspect any accountant worth their salt would understand the "barter token" rules better than I, but I don't see anything incompatible with the thinking that the Bitcoin economy is just a great big international ad hoc barter exchange.

@_date: 2013-05-02 07:16:42
1) The lame-ass copyright argument:




2) The "open-source" argument is solid at the moment, but I've said several times in this thread that I feel like Ripple.com have their own reasons for holding out on the server sources for now. It should also be noted that other "open source" projects have done this before (hey, this is coming, sign up for newsletters, here's some half-done shit you can play with but no sources yet), it's not like they've released binaries only but no sources... they're simply an "open source" project that hasn't released yet.
3) The "omg, run for profit, not decentralized argument":


You'd have to be an absolute idiot to think that Bitcoin is going to stay truly decentralized in the distant future. In *any* future where Bitcoin is successful, the main "mining" nodes are going to be running on ultra-thin profits, via economy of scale, either using renewable energy or sweetheart-negotiated deals with utility companies, or they'll be run by companies with a vested interest in the currency so they can afford to lose a little bit by mining.
The idea that everyone's going to buy their BFLs and Avalons and keep the whole thing decentralized over the next decade is just wishful thinking.
4) The "51% attack" thing. This is a nitpick against a point that's critical of Bitcoin, because this grossly over-simplifies the idea:


It glosses over the entire reason why this isn't as big of a deal in Bitcoin as people tend to think it is (it's only actually pointed out by Bitcoin proponents as a cover-your-arse thing, so no one can come along and say "uhh, what about the 51% thing?" where you're on the back foot pointing out it's not a big deal), and then uses faulty logic to apply this exact scenario to Ripple in a wrong way.
All the same reasons 51% is "not that big of a deal" to BTC, also apply to Ripple.
5) "HIDDEN INFLATION OMFG"


What the fuck does that even mean?
6) Pre-mining:


And before Bitcoin, every single internet currency was a failure.
7) "I hate debt so much"


Again, flawed assertion. You could configure the interface to your billing software/shopping cart to automatically "cash out" BTC from your gateway as an IOU comes to you. Effectively, unless you get lazy or want the convenience of fast spends, your exposure to a 3rd party going under with your BTC is no bigger than if you leave your money on MtGox or Bitstamp.
Given the *huge* number of people who start screaming when a BTC service goes down, I think it's safe to say that a good number of people are not as concerned about this as you might be.
Those are just the few I felt like picking on - sorry I didn't reply earlier I'm running on about 4 hours of sleep.

b) the double speak about XRP bugs me
c) I haven't personally vetted the consensus idea to see if it holds water.

If you can find a "worthwhile" task that is computationally expensive to do, but computationally cheap to verify (like hashing is) there's no reason an altcoin couldn't be made to use it, and people will throw hardware at it. 
The fact is that mining is busy work because it has to be in order to make it expensive to defraud the network. 
Bitcoin solves a few problems that were thought infeasible, things like mining and the naive injection are design flaws because distributed solutions to those problems don't exist yet. If a distributed solution is found, such an altcoin could be great.

You could apply that logic to any of the reasons to use BTC at all - do people really need a currency free of government intervention? 
In my mind this is a giant win for detractors, as they've been saying this is a problem for years. We've been told that the limited unit thing is fine because they can be subdivided, but you already can't send down to a Satoshi now without causing problems. Proponents and developers are saying pruning will fix this issue in the future then they implement this sort of shit.
Bitcoin doesn't scale, and without huge changes it's doomed never to be an Internet currency for everyone - it will remain a volatile commodity and the only people who will use it as a currency will be those like drug dealers who simply can't operate on the Internet without it.
I just hope Ripple doesn't end up being a pile of shit, because if we can do microtransactions on services like it (off chain for BTC) then settle up in the block chain then the sky isn't falling.

The problem with this is there's no evidence of this claim. The inflation curve in the Bitcoin mining algorithm is about the only way anyone would *ever* value it, but it's pretty silly for a world currency. It's not a feature, it's a design requirement.
That same inflation curve is going to mean it's only going to be worth more and more as the world economy grows - unless the world economy grows to a certain point and then flatlines, then you may have a point (and I will concede that maybe a world economy that's not based on the idea of infinite exponential growth or everyone goes broke does have it's charms, but there's nothing about Bitcoin that necessarily encourages that other than the fact Bitcoin's stability hinges on it).
And let's not even mention that with naive injection, every tiny little sneeze in the economy is going to lead to the market swinging wildly before arriving at a new valuation.
I think Bitcoin's an amazing tech, and I think it's a fantastic science project to answer many of the questions the "sound money" folks have been asking for years, but you're blind to think it'll stabilize eventually.

"BFL ASIC", as used by most bitcoiners, refers to ASIC-powered mining devices, so the title's not *that* misleading.
It's like how all sorts of sonsofbitches will call the case of a computer "the CPU", because at some level of abstraction it is a "central processing unit" - the fact that they're technically wrong won't stop them from saying it, and won't make you any more popular when you try to correct them.
Also, tearing down an ASIC itself is probably not particularly exciting and is most likely a destructive process. While I wouldn't mind seeing someone destroy a BFL ~~Jalapeno~~ 5GH Miner in front of people who still haven't got theirs, it's not the same sort of video.

So the Yubikey adds what, exactly, besides another portion of your key that's possible to lose, forever donating your money to the appreciation gods?
ie, what's the difference between said secure wallet with a yubikey as a portion of the key, and said wallet with just a password?
The *only* conceivable use for a Yubikey in your example is to have it memorize the whole key (or most of it, as you pointed out, but you gain very little) as a convenience measure, it's not a security measure - as by definition a Yubikey in static password mode is simply two "know somethings" and not a "have something".

But you didn't explain shit - you claimed a lack of infrastructure, but at one point in it's history Bitcoin lacked infrastructure (some might argue that it still does, at least in terms of it's valuation). The tulips comment is out of line without any evidence behind the claim, which you absolutely did not provide.
You may have explained in other threads why altcoins are bad, but you sure as shit didn't explain it here.
The fact is that sooner or later there will be an altcoin that's interesting. For this reason, people will likely invest in every new altcoin that comes along in the hopes that one will blow up. These people will get taken time and time again.
No new altcoin is going to hit the ground with infrastructure built for it because who is going to waste resources building infrastructure for a fork that may go nowhere? This, combined with the fact that as I said, Bitcoin has had little to no infrastructure for much of it's life, means that your argument doesn't hold water at all.

Why is it not sustainable?
Anyone who's been paying attention to bitcoin has noticed from the very beginning (or at the very least from the advent of GPU mining) that it was always going to be an arms race.
The only people who will be mining in the distant future (assuming everything BTC related stays the same) are:
* Huge entities who can function on the slimmest of margins and keep pouring more capital into mining equipment
* People who can afford to mine at a loss (either because they're obscenely rich hobbyists, or entities whose business depends on BTC being strong, so they can afford to mine at a loss)
Anyone who didn't see this coming and has skin in the mining game is a fucking idiot. The very instant your chosen ASIC vendor's delivery dates slid the first time, all your profitability calculations went out the window.
Note: the above is all actually assuming another difficulty jump, other comments are pointing out that this may just be a lucky streak.

I gave two: it's fast. It takes far longer for me to get BTC into BitStamp than it does for me to send it to you. 
Ripple also abstracts away all the currency conversion - as long as there's a trust pathway between my gateway and yours, you can have your BTC and not care what currency I had. I tell it I want to send you 0.1 BTC and it gives me one or more prices. 
It can be exchanges or just exchangers doing the conversion, it doesn't matter - Ripple will find the best path based on who we both trust (if we both trust BitStamp it's easy). 
XRP is necessary lube in the gears of Ripple, it will always be worth something (and of course that's how OpenCoin will cover costs at least in thebeginning) but that doesn't mean it will be competing with BTC in the slightest or imply it's a safe store of value. 
I personally suspect that as Ripple grows, OpenCoin are hoping to be the primary provider of validation servers through the network effect, so they will monetize it that way (validation fees), and that's why the server isn't available yet (so they get a head start). 
But the people buying more XRP than they need right now are fools - OpenCoin are not going to want to limit uptake of their baby just to keep a flimsy pseudo currency high, so I predict they'll be giving it out like candy sooner or later. But the truth is I don't know that, and am only speculating. Ergo it's totally not in the same boat as BTC - where the rules are clearly defined and everyone knows them. 
Spend some time researching and playing with it. Check the order books for true prices (not that 0.05BTC for 300XRP bullshit going on on the forums) and if you can find someone to loan you 75 or so XRP to get in, then you buy it back on BitStamp's Ripple exchange and return it, getting involved only amounts to a couple bucks USD tops. If you don't like what you see you'll have lost less than a candy bar and some time, but the potential for Ripple and BTC to work together are amazing.

Your bank could trivially be a gateway in, let's say, USD. They don't have to worry about BTC or any other currency they don't want to touch. They know you won't screw them to at least the same confidence they know you won't screw them over with your debit card.
BTC-only gateways can exist too, and then exchanges can exist in the middle to provide arbitrage between the different currencies, without actually touching the currency for the most part, just trading in IOUs between gateways they trust (note that the reference client can't do this AFAIK, but I believe you can support multiple issuers for a given currency pair in the protocol).
When you add in the fact that eventually for the most part, your gateways will know you a lot better than your current BTC exchange does when you buy BTC, it should help reduce fraud, which I'd wager is probably the main reason banks shy away from BTC (because it's very attractive way to monetize stolen bank accounts).

You also hold up the Genesis block, as though it's proof positive behind your line of thinking. The fact that you can't see the obvious issues in interpretation only proves your idiocy. 
Finally, as I'll address all the points I care to here, rather than blowing up reddit with 80 comments, no other Forex markets are not the same. Show me another currency with the crazy turbulence BTC has? There will be more crashes in price, inherently because of BTCs inability to cope with changes in demand.

**You have absolutely no idea how pooled mining works.**
You are completely and utterly wrong here - the pool organizes the blocks, decides what's in them, and assigns work which the miners hash. It's what actually stops you simply making off with the entire block reward when you find the lucky hash - you don't control the address where the block reward goes, the pool server's already generated that address and baked it into the block you and everyone on the pool is looking for the nonce for (or, in the case of eligius et al, they assign the generated rewards to people who helped mine blocks previously).
In the unlikely event that BTCGuild decided to start doing funny things with the blockchain, all it's miners would go along with it and likely be completely and utterly oblivious, assuming they didn't notice the stats and/or payouts came in a regular basis, and they don't watch the network as a whole.
@_date: 2013-02-21 10:48:42
It doesn't help when you have people who think that traits such as the perpetually decreasing inflation and the system of coin rewards are desirable. 
Simply put, it's pretty obvious that certain things many folks consider undesirable in BTC are the way they are because there is simply no distributed way to solve the problem, not because halving the rate of inflation every four years is sound fiscal policy.
If you pointed out the strengths of bitcoin, and stress that in your opinion the pros outweigh the cons, instead of preaching about "honest money" (as if a currency that a good portion of the user base believed was being manipulated by a guy named Pirateat40 could be considered "honest") you might convince a lot more people of its merits.

I'm just saying that no one knows where it's going to go. I personally feel that, while adoption has made leaps and bounds in the last 6 months, ~$500USD is at least a little over-priced.
But I also felt that $16 was overpriced. If I'd taken out a six-month line of credit and bought the shit out of it at $16, I'd be fuckin' laughing now. But I was too fearful to even invest a few hundred I had just sitting there festering away in Dwolla.
It could also go horribly, horribly wrong and in general I agree with your point that taking out a line of credit to leverage a speculative investment is, in general, a terrible idea. But I don't think the current price of BTC has anything to do with why it's a terrible idea.

I am not a tax attorney, but I imagine in many jurisdictions selling and trading for something are essentially the same thing.

It's absolutely in a bubble - XRP is grossly overvalued. You pretty much need enough XRP to maintain the trust lines in your account, and my guess is that between 1 and 10 XRP for transaction fees is probably going to be heaps forever. XRP can be used to allow trades between two users who don't have trust paths, but I personally foresee users with modified clients that all but ignore XRP, because of the issues people have with trusting OpenCoin's dominance of it. 
Ripple built on BTC would be stupid as fuck. Right now, if they released the server software and it worked as a decentralized network as it's supposed to (FFS it's not centralized, it's unreleased beta software with a client preview), and if it does everything they say it will, it'll make Bitcoin transactions between trusted parties fast.
Two users don't have to trust each other if they both trust a common gateway, or if there's a trust path between their gateways they can use to make the transaction. It basically provides two things Bitcoin desperately needs: quicker, but lower security off-chain transactions (stops blockchain bloat, speeds up transactions for most users) and distributed exchanges (assuming you get "traditional banking" entities like banks, western union, dwolla etc to issue IOUs to users they trust, you can then take those IOUs and trade them for BTC at very little risk).
This all hinges of course on what happens when the server software is released (it could be completely shit, or the consensus system may not do what they say it will), but until then it's not worth arguing about. But a debt-based system on top of BTC is pretty much the worst of both worlds.

Bitcoin also has the potential to enslave people. It doesn't solve the problem that money begets money, in fact it arguably makes it worse. In that case, if it ends up being the "one world currency", the few people who happen to be holding large amounts of it will be your masters.

Of course it is - it's pretty much the same with pretty much any subscription based service where there are costs associated with a user actually using the service (eg, it doesn't apply to things like satellite TV). A huge amount of profits comes from people who are subscribed, but not using the service, but are too lazy or forgetful to cancel it.

The problem with BFL is that they've failed to deliver on a difficult product, while continually being the most arrogant pieces of shit ever. Their "American Made" product is going to be *so* much more reliable than that cheap chinese knock-off, and it's going to use heaps less power and spit out three times as many Bitcoins.
Oh wait, except we missed the two performance targets, we tell people we're shipping "any week now" for months, and reliability concerns with Avalons aren't really that much of a concern anymore as I'd be very surprised if there is an Avalon out there that hasn't broken even by the time BFL ever ships (not to mention that I'd take the reliability concerns expressed by a competitor who then fails to meet their performance ratios by a huge margin with a grain of salt).
BFL hasn't delivered, so they should get off their fucking high horse - it doesn't matter how badass the unit is in the lab, until it's in customers hot little hands and doing what you said it will, it is not the time for gloating.
Oh, and just having spent USD on Bitcoins on the market last year instead of buying a BFL preorder would probably have netted you more BTC than your BFL ever will in it's lifetime.

I look at things like Ripple and the other alt-coins... so far none of them (with the semi-exception of namecoin) have really piqued my interest...

If they sell 1000 BTC worth of shit this quarter for a total volume to their dropshipper of ~$140k, then the price of BTC skyrockets to $850/coin, their ticker will show that they're at 100% of their goal when they're absolutely not. Unless Roger's just going to liquidate all that BTC at the end of the quarter and buy 1500 TVs with the money to make up the difference, the ticker's completely useless.

How would you stop users from flooding the network with trust and offer transactions? 


It takes longer for BTC to move into a gateway (and until the optimistic future when your bank is a gateway for say, USD,  fiat takes even longer) then it does for it to zing between many, many people. If you're the type who would leave some spending money on an exchange or Web wallet, then the transaction speed difference is huge. 
What BTC does for fiat, Ripple does for BTC (and fiat) - you may not care for how fast you can spend fiat, but the speed improvement is sold as a benefit by some. 
I will concede the point that there is political uncertainty regarding open coin, but once they (ugh) release a reference server the only thing they'll control is XRP, of which you only actually need such a tiny amount that in practice they'll control almost nothing... I seriously think that's why they're taking their time releasing it.

To elaborate on digitalh3rmit's excellent response, because I see this argument all the time on SA and other websites and it's flat out wrong and the point needs driving home:
Forget the number 51. Apart from one group of attacks whose cost far outstrips any potential benefit (and possibly discussion of powerful pool operators), just about any time you will make an observation about bitcoin and will utter the words "51 percent" you will be wrong. 
Rules are not enforced by 51% of the network, they're enforced by 100% of full clients (so ignore header only clients like electrum, everyone else validates). That's one hundred percent of reference clients. 
One of the advantages to holding that giant block chain is you validate everything that comes to you, you have to trust nobody as far as the rules are concerned. 
Now one can bring up the developers, changing the rules by a new protocol version, and then seeing where the mining power goes, but 51% is nowhere in that equation - I believe the agreed upon democratic process between miners is 95%, 950 blocks out of the last thousand agree and that's where we go. 
TL;DR: Forget everything you know about the number 51 in bitcoin and you'll be right more than wrong.

Bullshit, it's called discourse and it's useful to me when I'm corrected. I learned something, and I'm man enough to admit it. However it is a common misunderstanding with ripple that you need to trust someone in order to get money from them, which is false.


That's silly though, because if you already trust John then dollars should be dollars. If you don't trust John to deliver dollars as you would BitStamp, why would you extend trust to him in ripple?
I will admit that some of the automatic arbitrage stuff can be a bit creepy and I'd like a way to opt out of it, but the end result is the same - you control, 100%, the level of your exposure to risk.


That's fair enough, to which I counter with the same thing I always say: ripple in its current format is not useful or interesting, it merely has the potential to be useful. We can look at it and play with it, but IMHO you'd have to be a fool to accept any decent amount of money over it right now.
Pretend XRP doesn't exist, and then until it's not the case where you have to trust Ripple, it's not interesting.
If you want to put forth the idea that it will *never* work without trust in OpenCoin, that's a very interesting argument, but you'll have to do better than the proof you've put forward.
@_date: 2013-05-06 05:17:33

It's "only" $400m in even the most naive market cap calculation - do you honestly think that's too much money for this supposed "elite" to toy with? 
I'd also point out that to an extent we need speculation, or at least "market makers". They're the ones that smooth things out when you want to buy btc, send it to me for goods, then I sell it to buy food. 
It's only when they fuck up, and we're trying to do business on a roller coaster that things get bad. Time will tell, but I'm predicting a sharp correction at some point, can't say when.

I would definitely leave it *as well* as the normal tip, not in lieu of.
It's not even about the fact that many servers and so on are "non-computer literate", it's about the fact that a good many of them (at least in the USA) are over-worked and under-paid, and particularly in the USA it makes up a part of their pay.
So what you'd effectively be doing is taking a part of their "pay" and converting it to BTC without their consent. Add in the fact that a person's probably tired, and will be grouchy at seeing something that, as immediately recognizable, is no more valuable than a chick tract, and you're all but guaranteeing this person's first (maybe?) experience with BTC would be a negative one.
In short, unless you tip normally and leave these as extra, you're probably being counter-productive (leave aside issues of "screwing" your server completely).

This doesn't make you sound like a rational individual, FWIW.


That works in reverse too though. Ages ago I was running a small IT  consulting business. I had a fair few clients who preferred to pay in cash, and I didn't bother declaring it. Wahey, tax free income!
Then my wife and I went to move, and found our income from our tax returns (main way to prove income for self-employed folks) wasn't high enough to get the place we wanted. Explaining "but no I make way more than that I just like fucking over the government" doesn't make you look any better, and *definitely* telling them you refuse to let the thieving state take your hard earned cash won't make you look better.


Haha. Yes, because if there's one thing Bitcoin's known for it's not having your wealth disappear out form under you!
I'll close by pointing out that you're forgetting a *huge* income stream for many companies: business to business transactions. Here in Australia, for example, you collect GST on transactions once you're making enough money to be covered by the law. Most (all? I dunno, I'm not an accountant I pay someone else to worry about that shit) GST you pay to other companies is then deductible from the GST you owe - so you file reports with all the companies you paid GST on stuff from.
It's pretty easy for the government to audit this stuff - add up GST going in, add up GST coming out... if one is greater than the other, you get your shit audited.
The idea that Bitcoin's "tax free" or "untaxable" is AnCap masturbation, just like the idiotic assertion that there's "no transaction fees". It leads a whole bunch of people to get into the thing under false expectations, and then be disappointed in it when they find out it's simply not true.
TL;DR: Can you trade Bitcoin tax free? Yes, but you can do the same with cash and barter, to pretty much the exact same extent.

I.... I can't be the only one who sees the stinging irony in this statement can I?
Are you not even the tiniest bit self aware? Have I been caught out by Poe's law? What is going on here?
Bitcoin went for months, *months* with no infrastructure. The first exchange was an absolute train wreck from the get-go and it is *still* considered authoritative by many for some ungodly reason. No one's going to start a Bitpay for an alt-coin without liquidity, and something like Bitpay is probably required for an alt-coin to have any sort of infrastructure at all beyond exchanging.
Bitcoin cleared these hurdles, and I'm not entirely convinced that calling it a tulip bubble is still out of line at this point.
At least structure your anti alt-coin arguments so that they don't sound *exactly* like anti bitcoin arguments? 
Edit: Full disclosure: I think, from the sounds of it, quarkcoin is entirely a scam mainly because it sounds extremely pre-mined. At least that is an argument that doesn't echo Bitcoin though.

It's not, IMHO, but it's apparent I'm in the minority of Ripplers in that respect. I kinda like Ripple, without the XRP. I'll use it as a barrier to entry, a price of admission, and I concede that as an anti-spam measure it works reasonably well and see nothing wrong with OpenCoin selling these anti-spam tokens to fund development. I'm fucked if I'm going to hold any significant amount of XRP ever. I like to pretend XRP doesn't exist now I've got enough to fund all the accounts I could ever want.
I still like Ripple, even though I don't care for XRP.
But I mean seriously, go look at some of the shit people are saying about Ripple, and about LiteCoin, etc. Compare it to all the arguments that people make about Bitcoin, that many of these same fucking people will espouse in the exact same breath, with a straight face, like they don't even realize how completely and utterly retarded they're being.

You're missing my point. The full-chain clients **do not trust the blockchain at all**, they will vet it themselves (ensuring it complies to the rules as they understand them), block by block, as each block comes in. As I said earlier, this is why the initial sync takes so bloody long.
Try connecting an older version of the reference client to the current network and see if it syncs up with the current canon blockchain - it won't, it'll stop when it hits the last block it thinks was valid.

@_date: 2013-08-02 22:47:02
That's terrible advice though. If you think Bitcoin is worth less now than it will be in the future, but it also costs less than mining them then you're better off buying them.
The only reason to ever mine in such a scenario is a) contributing to the security of the network or b) if a supply of virgin coins is worth the premium. In neither case do you really consider "profit" at any date to inflate the bottom line.
Buy a USB miner because you think it's cool, not to make a profit.
Edit: Some may argue a third reason c) you are too young for a bank account and your parents won't notice the electricity usage from a miner. These people are fucking assholes.
@_date: 2013-05-20 04:48:55
It's centralized right now. It's not "closed source", it's unreleased software. The few people who have access to the server software have the sources as well.
It's centralized and unreleased right now for a very good reason - there's still many bugs in it, and it'll be a lot easier to fix those bugs and move the software forward if there's less versions of it out there. Complaining about Ripple now is like complaining about Bitcoin between the whitepaper and the public release, the only difference being there's an actual thing you can play with out there on the internet right now, and some fools think XRP is worth a bunch.
XRP is the price of admission, so it'll always be worth "something". OpenCoin will have a very tenuous grasp on the Ripple network once the server sources are released, so I think they're playing it safe by taking their time releasing it. If they fuck around with XRP after the sources are released, it'll get forked by someone and if everyone decides to use the fork without OpenCoin controlling all the XRP, OpenCoin lose everything. I do know for a fact that I'm almost definitely not doing *shit* with Ripple in any meaningful way until it's available publicly. I'll hack around on it and write some blog/forum posts, but I'm not accepting payments until it's sources are viewable.
But as I've said time and time again, Ripple is - if it will do the things OpenCoin says it will - something to really get excited about WRT Bitcoin. Several Bitcoin developers have now admitted that Bitcoin can't survive with all transactions on the chain, they have to go somewhere, and Ripple is (again, assuming it does what they say it will) a pretty good place for the off-chain transactions to take place **in the future** - the distributed exchanging of IOUs from different gateways will be a huge bonus.
A future where the source code's publicly available and it does everything OpenCoin says it will.

@_date: 2013-05-01 04:26:58
You can operate a gateway without ever actually touching currencies you aren't interested in, so theoretically banks could run gateways in local currency. BTC users can use any arbitrage providers in their trust path transparently. 
BTC gateways could exist too, solely to get BTC in and out of the network, and avoid having to handle banks at all. By severing the links between banks and BTC and putting trust metrics between them, you'll make it a lot harder for BTC exchangers to be found culpable for stolen funds that go between them, so you remove the issue there too. 
The only complaints I have besides the obvious source code issue and the devs lack of presence (beyond Joel Katz), it's that FinCEN are going to hate it (Bitcoiners might find that cute though).
Ripple fixes lots of the issues in BTC without replacing it (XRP is not a store of value in the same sense, don't be threatened by it), you can still use BTC however you want, but people who aren't ready to indulge completely can have almost instant transfers, exchanges without MtGox, etc. 
You should be excited, not threatened.

That's not even remotely the same thing.
I gave my reasoning - selling when low only locks in those losses. The boom and bust cycle shows no signs it will ever stop completely (in fact the very rules of Bitcoin mean it's likely to be a permanent economic feature), and if you're patient it'll probably eventually go back up to 265 if that's what you bought it at. 
But if you sold at 90, that wealth's gone forever, rather than for a couple years. If you couldn't hold onto it for a couple years at an extreme paper loss,  you sunk too much into it. 
Instead of making shitty analogies, let's do an exercise. Suppose you bought a few weeks ago at, let's say 98USD (forgive me I was out in the wilderness and wasn't watching the price much). The price suddenly begins a downward trend this morning and is already below your buy in. What's your stop loss exit price? Mine is zero, because of the reasons above.

No, because the client doesn't actually "receive" anything.
I'll elaborate: The Bitcoins are "sent" when the transaction propagates throughout the network, and the transaction is "confirmed" when the transaction is added to a block (with 6 confirmations being 6 blocks after your transaction is included).
Your client shows them as "received" when it detects the transaction on the network, and spendable after it's confirmed. It can do this after it comes back online and syncs up to the blockchain, but the above process happens with or without your client (that's how things like paper wallets work).

This is only if you extend trust to John. If you stick to trusting a single or a couple of gateways, and redeeming any balances from the gateways ASAP, then it works quite well with zero trust issues and no more "debt" or risk than you have buying BTC off some exchange.


While I'll agree with the second sentence if you modify it to "until it's publicly released" (if for no other reason than that having all the validation nodes in OpenCoin's hands is not palatable), it *is* open source. Everyone who has the server binary has the sources as well. It's just not publicly available.
Number 3 I will agree with that I am creeped out by it, and I do not consider XRPs to be a useful store of value. Indeed, as many of you guys have said, the "store of value" thing is the least interesting use of Ripple. It's my personal preference to buy/borrow/beg just enough XRP to bootstrap an account and then pretend it doesn't exist. I realize that this puts me at odds with OpenCoin's "monetize Ripple" plan but it's the safest bet, IMHO. XRP is pretty much the worst of both worlds when compared to USD and BTC.

Yes, but the full-chain clients also verify each block as it comes from miners (or other clients). They don't just say "oh, 51% of the network agreed this block is valid", it must comply with the rules or clients reject it (which is why you can't use some of the older versions of the reference client, as they'll reject currently mined blocks even though pretty much 100% of the network will agree those blocks are canon).
I know it's something most people already get by the time they start responding to r/Bitcoin threads, but it's still a huge misunderstanding on many people's part - including several loudmouth detractors. It's not simply a case of you control X% of the network, you can do whatever you want. The network, without the miners, will still enforce the rules.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:04:27
This is probably the first honest post I've seen on that subject though - tons of people are peddling the exact opposite, usually when talking about the rules being enforced by consensus, about it being a "democratic" process, with miners all getting a vote.

I don't disagree with the statement above, what I disagree with is the fact that you seem to think this means that BTC companies are always doomed to shitty customer service. If they can't afford to operate their service well, they deserve to go out of business - not continue limping along because they set rates by plucking figures out of the air or going with what the competition went with or whatever, without figuring out their costs and margins.
I was a reasonably early adopter with Bitcoin - the price was around $.70 when I got into it. This isn't about risk for me, this is about demanding a certain level of service from companies and refusing to do business with those who can't (or better yet, competing with them if you think you can). Your argument basically amounts to "if you don't like getting ripped off, fuck off" which is off-the-charts idiocy.
The fact that banks and BTC exchanges have different margins because they monetize differently is entirely irrelevant to the conversation - we were talking about scrutiny, not expected service(s).

Pointing out misunderstandings isn't useful? Someone said Ripple requires you to trust John to get money from him, and I pointed out it doesn't (this is a leftover from the RippleClassic times) - it only requires you to trust a gateway such as BitStamp, who plenty of people already do. 
There is a delay between you giving them one currency and getting another safely in your account, during which time you're trusting them not to disappear on you. You do the same thing on Ripple - your exposure is only as high as you want it to be, and you can operate on a single trust line only (to one gateway) and Ripple will work just fine.

Huh? I've found several wallets in my lifetime, I just drop them in the local police station. Sure there's a chance some scumbag cop might keep what's in it, but that's not really my problem. It's very little effort involved, and assuming an honest cop everything's peachy.
I seriously don't understand the mentality of sticking your hand out for a tip when you fix this shit. I found a glaring security hole in TracFone's website, and after accidentally exploiting it myself (I failed to jump through enough hoops to not trigger it, is how bad it was) I contacted them initially because I wanted to pay the proper fee for recharging my shitty burner phone.
Then after spending hours on the phone with them looking for someone capable of understanding the situation, I left them time to fix it. I later posted all the details for bragging rights, because that's what we do. That's what I thought this story would be about, a security researcher who felt slighted in some way.
I didn't realize it'd be some hack upset because they didn't pay him. I agree a thanks would have been nice, but IMHO sticking your hand out for some free Bitcoin is seriously shitty behavior.

I'd agree, if smoking wasn't such a giant waste of productivity in many sectors. Can't smoke within 30 feet of a building, hanging for one every hour, average of five minutes or so... That adds up to an employer losing a lot of work over one addictive habit.

I'm the opposite. I caught the falling knife twice during the fall from $30 peak a couple years back (including guessing the dead cat bounce). Felt amazing, even though I think we're talking about maybe $100 worth of BTC tops. I posted the approximate numbers back then on the forum, but the percentage gain was huge for a couple days' trading - I think it was something like I sold at 29, bought at 18, sold at 23 and finally bought back in at about $9 (though if I'd waited for $5 I'd have come out substantially further in front). It was on TradeHill so the spreads were bigger and it was easier.
Fast forward a couple years and I decide to try again. Took a bath a few times losing about 0.2 BTC after giving up and buying back in for approximately my sell price (losing out to exchange fees, and on at least one occasion buying back in for higher), and then the last time I decided not to realize the losses, set an optimistic buy-in price and wait (and it took about three months of holding USD to get back in).
So don't discount beginners luck, if you're just an unlucky bastard like I am, it may be the only luck you get. If only I hadn't squandered that luck on chump change.

It's not just about hacking the pool - it's for his own benefit too. If you're one of the really tinfoil hat types that's convinced the Fed are going to try and bust up Bitcoin, surely you'd consider the idea that anyone in control of 51% of the network is a potential target?
I mean I honestly think that even at $1B, Bitcoin still isn't really on these types of people's radar (or if it is, they're making money trading it), but I'm just saying if you are the type to believe this then one has to consider that scenario.
What boggles my mind is that keeping 51% of the network out of the control of one group is such a central tenet to Bitcoin security, and yet people voluntarily keep joining one particular pool because of their own profit and convenience. Surely I'm not the only one who sees the irony in this?

He's pointing out how very few people were actually involved in making the change - the so-called democracy of Bitcoin proved to be a farce, because it boiled down to developer(s? ) and a couple pool operators tallying all the votes and making the decision to resolve the fork. 
The fact it was for a good cause is almost irrelevant, a small clique of people decided a small change in direction to resolve the fork, and most users were not consulted. 
I personally don't think Satoshi foresaw pooled mining being a thing because what it boils down to is democracy with a centralized clique tallying the votes. I think it's a valid criticism, I believe it's solved by more people using p2ppool or whatever it's called, but it's still valid.

It's more than that... Bitcoin is a fascinating experiment in free market adaptation, in deflationary currencies, etc.
I've a feeling that in at least some respect, the naysayers are correct and that it's inherently deflationary aspects will be it's undoing. I remain thoroughly unconvinced that all the mises folks are right.
But that's what's great about it, is if it passes the "adapt around regulation" experiment, we'll get to see exactly what happens. People place their bets accordingly and the winners will come out on top.
Of course there's a chance that if it goes horribly wrong, the losers will "no true scotsman" the answer away, but it's still a fascinating experiment.

I used to trade in a lot of things, particularly when the price was stuck around $5, those were good times. I could sell something in the morning, and didn't have to worry about whether I could spend them in the afternoon without taking a beating.
It's very tough to be a "come on guys, actually use them" when the price is moving like this... I cannot for the life of me understand why people think that a wildly fluctuating price is a good thing for the currency (it's good for day traders and that's about it).

If you can find something "productive" that is distributed, expensive to do, but cheap to validate and cheap to validate that it was indeed expensive to do, it could be substituted for the proof of work. 
The problem is that no such problem exists. Bitcoin mining is the way it is because there's no decentralized way to ensure someone with heaps of crypto equipment can't do evil things. 
This is, incidentally, why it must keep growing, despite the fact it grows far in excess of the "power" actually needed to handle the transaction load - if it's not growing, it's not a moving target, and anyone who can equal the power can double-spend (though whether that's an actual threat is a discussion for another day). 
TL;DR: Bitcoin's burning of useless busy work is what secures it. If you have a better idea that actually works, you could be Satoshi Nakamoto.

"Totally take control" is a huge stretch, there are things a miner with even 100% of the mining power can do, and there's always things they can't. Basically it boils down to picking and choosing which transactions are in the chain, and makes double spends a problem. That's a far cry from "Totally take control". 
I think a lot of the free market types are in for a shock, should mining power condense to several really big players and a bunch of really small ones. But that's what's amazing about Bitcoin, it's a great (albeit poorly controlled) experiment to answer these questions.

I question your reading comprehension - I don't not like you, I don't even know you. You are, however, being an asshole for no reason. I know this because we can smell our own and I've done the exact thing in the past. 
Having a stop loss exit price means you will, during high volatility, eventually buy high and sell low. That's my point. It's unavoidable. 
I already admitted that you were talking about trading and I missed that - I don't believe the entire thread is talking about trading as many people on here are long term investors and they're typically the ones to buy into the "hooold" thing. 
But seriously, I am very interested in your amazing plan. Pretend you bought this morning and it's gone down five bucks since then. What's your exit price? When is the hurt too much? 
The reason I feel the way I do is because after the original run up, the price settled around five bucks. I managed to catch the knife twice, including guessing pretty amazingly close to the peak (I think I sold at about a dollar under the peak), and guessing the dead cat bounce as well. 
I bought back in at about 7 the last time. I decided to go through and spend all my coins, rather than sell them. What I should have done was just let them sit and stop watching, but that was a boring game. The fact is I didn't "need" that money, my card was already paid for and if I'd just let them sit for a couple years then at just about any point on the timeline this year they'd have been worth far in excess of my buy in price. They could have also been zero, but I didn't care about that. 
But please, for the benefit of all of us, enlighten us to your amazing planning skills. Tell me again how it's better to sell now at a loss than to just wait and see. You're already burned, you might as well bet the farm and if you can't deal with that you sank too much into it.

Most of it's pre-mined, and they are hoping to distribute it in an equitable manner to get people using the network rather than awarding it to people running the validation nodes.
Problem with this is that they've not actually said what they're doing with it. Some clowns are hoarding it in the hopes it'll increase in value, but there should be a pretty good sized giveaway coming pretty soon as they engage new users.
But on the whole, they're not very transparent about how much they're going to giveaway or when.

That was pretty much always bound to happen though. Some folks have suggested that it's even a positive thing.

In fact, Bitcoin will make it worse.
I continue to be amazed by the people who think that inflation is an actual problem that the majority face on a daily basis. I know more people with negative net worth than positive. I know very few people with enough in cash savings that inflation will affect them. Almost everyone I know with any amount of money at all is smart enough not to have more than their few thousand dollars in emergency funds in their local currency, the rest is typically invested. A person with more than $10,000 (to pluck a figure from the air) in fiat is almost without exception a fool, and you know what they say about fools and money.
The entire "inflation == bad for the poor" argument is utterly retarded. You can point out that inflation is a silent tax on money all you like, but don't fuckin' pretend it affects the poor.

Umm, what? 
Look I think Bitcoin is fascinating and credit Satoshi as a forward-thinking savant for many of his design decisions, but I don't get what you're saying. 
Satoshi has nothing to do with how fast Bitcoin is taken up. The only thing he decided on was the coinbase schedule, and that was more of a "pick a curve which basically guarantees rarity at the expense of all else" and then actual values were plucked from the air around that. 
But it has no effect on economic catastrophe because if Bitcoins came twice as fast they'd just be worth half as much. 
The curve was really only chosen (as far as I can tell) in an attempt to approximate gold's supply curve, in the hopes of guaranteeing scarcity. We've still not (and may never) answered the question as to if this will lead to economic problems for other reasons.

@_date: 2013-10-10 08:17:06
Yep, you're arguing against a point I'm not making - I never implied they had additional powers, just that they don't "trust the blockchain". Full-chain clients will refuse to accept a block they see as invalid, regardless of the number of miners that worked on it.
Edit: Let me try put it a little more succinctly. What is difficulty, if not a rule of the protocol? If you take a miner and you "mine" a block after the current one at difficulty=1, then submit it to the network. What happens? Every client goes "uh huh" and ignores it.
The exact same thing happens with anything else that breaks the rules. Miners cannot break the rules, regardless of how many of them there are working on a block that breaks the rules. The network will simply ignore it.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:18:09
You made no argument at all - you said that poor people weren't shielded from inflation by investments whereas rich people were. That is no indication that inflation is the primary thing causing people grief that they should be concerned about. Note that making such an argument (that inflation is the primary thing they should be worried about) implies that things like Bitcoin will not fuck them even worse - this is not proven to be true, and no evidence exists for this claim.
In fact, I believe the opposite - that the people with the funds to act as market makers and smooth out the prices of daily transactions willy simply abscond with more and more of the 21m BTC. For your claim to be true, you will have to demonstrate not only exactly *how* the average poor person is fucked by inflation, but also that they will not be fucked even harder by market makers.


If you are that close to economic ruin that $30 out of your $1k emergency funds is the straw that breaks the camel's back, then your finances are in trouble already. And guess what, inflation's probably not to blame for that.


I somehow suspect it had more to do with financial ineptitude (I know, we can smell our own). But go on, ELI5 how your savings were wiped out by inflation.


Nice ad hominem. I'm curious as to what you mean by "like you" - what exact type of asshole am I? I'm a poor-as-fuck, serial-failed-entrepreneur and Bitcoin early adopter who simply happens to not buy into the meme that inflation is the worst thing since the holocaust. I'm curious as to how that means I don't care about you and your family that couldn't afford a morphine shot.

I think it's the opposite - Bitcoin is not now as Satoshi designed it at all.

No, it's because of the way Nvidia cards are designed in relation to the type of work that mining is. It doesn't mean they're inferior, they're just the wrong tool for the job - like trying to drive a Formula 1 car up a mountain on a gravel track.
If I'm not mistaken, Nvidia cards hold their own on some other tasks, like Seti or Folding.

How much USD would you transfer to Bitstamp at a time when you're buying? Ie, what level of exposure would you be comfortable with. $100 at a time? $10k at a time?
That's the same level your Ripple trust metrics should be. You trust Bitstamp for $100 at a time, and that's it. I (and many others it seems) operate under the mistaken understanding from "Ripple Classic" where you trust all your friends and it's just a giant tangled web of debt, but Ripple works fine with a single trust line to one website that you expect will hand over Bitcoins - which is fundamentally no different to what you do to get your hands on BTC right now.

I like to pretend that XRP doesn't exist, and that Ripple is just a neat method to transfer debt. So in that case no, they won't control anything "money" once it's released.


They can't move XRP or any other IOU without your consent for the same reason someone with  80% of the bitcoin network can't.
But besides that, I'm sure I'm not alone in that I'm not using it until it's public.


Yes, and until they release the server I'm not suggesting anyone use it or put money into it in any meaningful way. Spend a couple bucks to get acquainted with it and see how cool the idea is if it fits everything OpenCoin says it will.
If they don't release the code, I wholeheartedly agree it is not an interesting technology.

Nuclear **isn't** clean. Breeder reactors just aren't there yet and we're left with storing spent fuel somewhere. It's still something we have to pull out of the ground and consume, so it's not technically a renewable and it's pretty easy to see why most greeny types oppose it. 
It's not about slashing standards of living at all (well, I concede it probably is for the small minority of people the types of who live in cob houses and mill their own wheat with wind power), it's about promoting technological advances that by all means should have occurred already, but the free market is a terrible, reactionary way to solve big picture problems in an instant gratification society. 
I like how you hand wave away climate change by describing it as sea levels rising a bit and Canada getting warmer - you do realize the Arctic/antarctic only stretch so far, and that there's quite a body of evidence that climate change will be a feedback loop? That is to say, we won't be able to say "okay, that's warm enough I think, we can grow wheat in Saskatchewan and Bananas in Indiana."
There's also issues of biodiversity - sure we may be able to sustain our population by advances in farming, but it seems to me from a layperson's perspective that the more we reduce biodiversity the more diseases and such tend to affect yields. Mother nature tends to advance ways of fucking things up quicker than Monsanto can prevent her. 
There are other issues, like people closer to the equator dying more often from heat related illnesses. It's funny that you view all these things as less "anti human well being" than simply admitting maybe we can do without a few creature comforts for the sake of not polluting with quite so much impunity.

But it's (naive coin injection, oblivious to market expansion/contraction)  definitely not desirable behavior in my humble opinion. If someone can solve that problem in a decentralized fashion, the only interest in BTC 1.0 would be as a speculative get rich quick scheme. I don't think it's possible to solve, but then again I didn't think something like BTC was possible either.

I think what we have is probably about as good as we'll ever get - the vast majority of the value that Bitcoin has *now* is based off value it "should" have in the future. There's absolutely no way we had a $2B economy last week.
There's one of the alt-coins that has no coin limit, the injection simply goes on forever... I seriously doubt it will gain any traction.
If anyone comes up with a cryptocurrency that's aware of it's own economic conditions and injects new currency based off those conditions in a decentralized fashion (with slight deflation, to make up for the fact there's almost certainly no decentralized way to destroy currency), you'd have Bitcoin 2.0... but I don't know if there's any solution to that problem.

You stand a pretty good chance of looking like a fool a few months after you successfully convince him.
More people then ever know about Bitcoin, right? But that doesn't mean if he accepts it again that he'll see enough conversions to warrant the effort.
Look up almost any business that accepts Bitcoin and published payment figures... Almost without exception the actual financial response is dismal, no one actually cares about the Madagascar Penguin style happy slapping the community does whenever a new merchant accepts it if no one actually opens their wallets and buys some shit. And particularly when the price if going up, no one does. Everyone wants everyone else to spend theirs so their own raises in value.
TL;DR; Don't try to convince him. He'll either come around our he won't. He's already tried it so he'll likely watch it closely and accept it at a later date, out he won't. Buy you'll look pretty dumb if you convince him and it fails again.

How can you possibly know either of these things beyond lazy speculation? Yes OpenCoin want to make a profit, but you can make a profit and make the world a better place (I feel almost dirty having to say that on a Bitcoin forum, where I thought it'd be all free-market, competition, profit is good, etc). As for Satoshi's motivations, again, what the fuck?


I don't think I've made any secret of it that I don't trust it either. I'll reserve that trust for when the sources are released and we can take a look at it. I don't envision me ever holding a significant amount of XRP, and don't particularly care what happens to the value of it because I believe that based off what OpenCoin claims, as long as XRP's value is greater than absolutely zero, it'll work.
I'm completely prepared to walk away, shrugging my shoulders and saying "well, that was fun" should it turn out not to work as advertised, or if they try not releasing the sources publicly. I have literally nothing but a bit of time invested into Ripple. I'm not imploring anyone to trust anything, I'm simply saying dogpiling on Ripple/OpenCoin, using many of the same arguments used to disparage Bitcoin early in it's lifespan, just makes people look like a bunch of tools.

So then we fall back to the previous argument - do we even really need a currency free of government intervention? USD works fine for spending if you don't want to hold more of it than you're going to spend in a month.
There's also the whole free market thing - free market forces are supposed to fix problems like this, why is intervention necessary? If market forces can't fix this problem, what will pop up in the future that will need intervention to fix, and will the people holding BTC like it?
The "solution" raises more problems, IMHO.

Actually you just illustrated why it's not actually a web of trust from a user's perspective, it's just a trust score. People don't actually say "hrm, I trust this guy and he had a good experience so I'll trust them too" they typically say "high rating, old account, shut up and take my money".

Tipping is *expected* in the USA. It's uncool to run up a debt, and then expect to settle that debt in some obscure currency without arranging it first. If you left $50 worth of pesos, most people would probably be pissed as well.
If you're in a country where tipping isn't "mandatory" then getting pissy over the form of a gratuity is shitty. But in a country where it's routinely counted as part of your income, it needs to be in the local currency.
... and that's before we get into a discussion over the meaning of the words "worth" and "value". To a waitress with no interest in technological stuff (making huge leaps of judgment about the waitress in this scenario, but bear with me) then even $1000 worth of BTC is not necessarily worth $100.

Raising taxes on the rich in the USA isn't necessarily a bad thing - they're at an awful low rate, where Bush put them and it was supposed to usher in a new age of economic activity and pay for the tax cuts through increased revenue. That didn't happen, and one of Obama's biggest mistakes is that he promised he wouldn't raise taxes in order to win the election, and then fucked around on raising them back where they ought to be.
And Romney doesn't not deserve a lot of money because he's rich, he doesn't deserve a lot of his money (or your respect as a presidential candidate) because he made a lot of that money systematically scrapping various companies.
The money grab in Cyprus was pretty bullshit, but many of the folks complaining loudest were putting their money their for bullshit reasons anyway, and you could argue they deserved it. I still think, regardless of those people who always seem to be caught up in tax avoidance when they get hosed, that if such a thing were to happen in the USA I'd go apeshit - FDIC-insured should mean safe.

This is so wrong it's ridiculous. It won't allow others to manipulate their position in government in order to widen the gap, but there is absolutely no evidence someone with a good chunk of Bitcoin couldn't manipulate the market (and many in this community believed that very thing was happening with Pirate).
Furthermore it always widens the gap between those who can afford to save and those who cannot. It can not work in any other way once the inflation stops, so suggesting this is just bullshit at its finest.
Wealth begets wealth and there is nothing about Bitcoin's design that inhibits that.

Yeah, I didn't mean you were retarded, merely that you were *being retarded* in your statement. I now take that back - you are completely retarded. 
Again, I must stress, I didn't say inflation is good. I said why most governments choose to include inflation in their economic policy but deliberately made no judgment as to its merits because it's outside the scope of this argument. 
I also didn't state that Bitcoin was undesirable, I only stated that the chosen method of coin distribution is not perfect. It's my belief that while it's not perfect, it's about as good as you'll get workout compromising what makes Bitcoin. If someone figures out a distributed way to get coins out in a way that's not subject to the whims of the market the way naively injecting new currency at ever-decreasing rates is, I think it'd be hugely popular, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 
You, on the other hand keep touting this as a feature. Which is pretty retarded.

Neglecting to consider the fact that I've held BTC for a while, used it to transfer wealth from one continent to another without losing my ass in the process, I mined until it was no longer reasonable to do so with my 5770 and I *still* accept BTC as payment in two of my small businesses.
But what can I expect from the types of retard who consider everyone who doesn't completely drink the kool-aid and dates to comment on any aspect of Bitcoin, a "troll".
So laugh all the way to the bank, by all means. There's more to this world than money, and even if BTC hits a million USD it still won't make up for your deficiency.

I don't even think it'll make that much difference there anyway.

Yes, much of the USA has obscenely cheap utilities. If you're in a place with easy access to things like Hydro it's even cheaper.
I'm currently in Australia, where the price per kWh is $.22AUD. But the thing is, if I mine during the day, it cuts into the solar rebate, which is a whopping ~$.60AUD - so essentially if I mine during the day instead of selling the power back to the grid, it costs me ~$.60AUD/kWh to mine. Terribly expensive, so I don't even mine for hobby purposes now.

No, I forget which block it is - IIRC someone was trying to make a coin base with a "donation", pouring one out on the ground for Satoshi, and if I remember the story correctly it was bigger than intended. 
I think the coin base in that block was 45BTC or something like that. I'll see if I can find it later (been redditing from my phone for days) or someone else might know a fast way to find it.

This is such a terrible piece of faux-logic id ever there were one. My evidence is twofold:
* Like most open source projects, I would almost be willing to bet that the percentage of stake holders who have personally audited the code is very small. Most are content to consider it okay that someone smarter than them will have, because security researchers get famous by outing these things, but still. 
* SolidCoin had value once too. Not the same market cap as BTC (and tangentially, I mourn the loss of it as a lightning rod to attract the retarded of the retarded away from BTC), but it did have some value. Just sayin'.

I meant "51% of the miners" not "51% of the network". I get the point, but you'd be surprised at the number of people who don't.

How is it not relevant? I'm pointing out a situation where tax evasion is a hindrance in the real world. Granted, maybe it's only a hindrance for little people, but still.


Yet you've yet to prove *why* you can expect more people to do so. What level of acceptance do you think Bitcoin will get to? If you're thinking it'll replace the USD, you're smoking crack, but let's go with that theory for shits and giggles.
Yes, hypothetical programmer gets paid $10,000 worth of BSD (and let's, for shits and giggles, pretend that's a whopping 1000mBTC) while living in the USA. BTC acceptance is high, and he can spend wherever he wants. If *one* of those places reports his spending for whatever reason (and there could be plenty, if you want to expect BTC to replace a reserve currency), then you have a real-world link to a chain of transactions all out in the open on the Bitcoin public ledger.
Much like current tax situations, the onus is on *you* to prove where money went and where it came from. The "thieving state" may require you to keep meticulous records that correspond to blockchain transactions. They may even pass a law to say that using a mixer is against the law, in the hopes of tracking things like Silk Road down. My point is as more people start using BTC, particularly those who have no interest in bucking the state, what you're proposing will get harder, not easier. One transaction links you to a sizable input, the IRS (or whoever) starts asking questions, then you're stuck there coming up with explanations for the transactions.
It could also go the other way, with widespread Bitcoin adoption being a fat wedge that'll eventually slide the entire world one extreme or the other.
If we don't go with hypothetical deep penetration of BTC it stays  easier to skip out on taxes for smaller amounts. I'd love to hear your plan for say, earning a large amount of currency in a foreign country, transferring it to another and say, buying a house, while incurring as little a tax burden as possible.


Again, yet to prove why you think it will be any different after Bitcoin gets whatever level of acceptance you think is going to make things better.
Edit: Also, duly noted that you completely ignored my real-world example of how auditing works in many cash-based businesses, and went straight for pointing out a supposed "straw man" which wasn't actually an argument, just a subtle jab at you guys.

So sell your gold and buy a lead pipe, then spend the rest in a new-found windfall.
The point of these absurd end-of-the-world discussions is to show that the difference between "not quite completely and utterly useless" and "completely and utterly useless" is rather trivial when on the grand scale both of them are still utterly useless.
The *only* argument the goldbugs make against BTC that holds any weight is the history-as-money one, and the fact that when presented with a gold bar the average person will go all "oooh, shiny". None of the rest of them are of any use whatsoever, in terms of it's usefulness-to-value ratio in end-of-the-world terms, gold is every bit as useless as Bitcoin is.

A 51% double-spend attack? The fact that even at this early point in the game, even two or three entities who have the clout to collude to pull off such an attack have a huge investment that suddenly becomes worthless in the event of such an attack. Obvious 51% attacks have an economic reason against them happening. 
But other, more subtle undesirable behavior, like picking and choosing transactions or deliberately orphaning blocks from tiny mining pools...

You already lose any money held in a BTC exchange if it shuts down, so how is this any different? (OK admittedly you might get it back eventually, but the same goes with Ripple IOUs to a gateway and I'd be interested to see some stats in how many exchanges have a 100% payback rate when they go under)
If you have a Ripple account, you set how much you're willing to trust the exchange/gateway for and payments higher than that amount won't be able to go through. Then if you call in your IOUs as soon as you receive them you minimize your exposure to the risk - it's about the same risk as buying BTC from the same exchange.

It's been my personal opinion for a long time that the dwindling injection is not a feature, and that it's a side effect of keeping the prospect of a future value. The are a few relevant design criteria for Bitcoin:
* Must stand a reasonable chance at holding value for people to want to accept them as payment
* Must not have a central authority
The only way to accomplish this is to sacrifice the ability to inject currency in lock step with the growth of the economy and go with the naive injection that ensures scarcity in the future - I don't think an inherently deflationary currency was necessarily the goal at the outset, my reading of the Genesis block is simply intent to build a currency free of manipulation by central bankers.

You're wrong here. In layman's terms, grossly oversimplified, you build your alt coin block, hash it, and include that hash in the main coin block. Then your miners start searching for the nonce for the main block and completely ignore the alt coin block.

I mean, if I was BFL I'd be stressing the "reliability concerns of cheap, chinese knock-off" meme for all it's worth right now, but to my knowledge they've still not actually put together even one working ASIC prototype. So for all their talk, they don't actually know that theirs will perform to spec - look at Josh on the BTC forums, does this look like a guy who knows exactly what he's talking about, confident enough to say that they'll meet or exceed performance/heat criteria?
And as I said in the other thread, the first few Avalons will pay for themselves in about a week. The thing only has to last a few months to make itself absolutely worthwhile, and if a decent number of Avalons are out and mining for any significant amount of time before BFLs actually start getting plugged in, the projected profit margins of BFL units could tank significantly.

FTFY. Every full chain client verifies every block - it's what takes the initial sync to the blockchain on the reference client so long. 
It's not just miners that enforce the rules, it's all full clients. Miners only compete to decide the canonical version of the chain, they're not the sole arbiters of what's valid.

So write out a protocol for how Ripple could prevent or penalize spam without XRP and post it, I'm sure there are plenty of people who would love to hear about it.


I was pointing out how fast you could spend it around - you went back to a scenario where you just sell LTC for BTC and withdraw it again, not exactly Ripple's strongest point.
My point is that you can send BTC to someone, who can then send it to someone else, repeat 5 times. You've probably wasted at least a few hours waiting for first confirmations. Ripple does it way quicker.

I think it was fine during the flat periods. As I've said before countless times on this subreddit, I did my most trading (as in buying and selling things and services for Bitcoin) during the flat spot around five bucks.
Unless you're buying up BTC hoping for a giant payday, what matters is not the value, but the velocity at which that value changes. Whether it's going up or down, if it's doing it like a fuckin' rocket it's bad for everyone except the daytraders. A flatter market is better for almost everyone, and it's not the end of the world if it sticks firm at $15 or $20 or even $5 for 6 months at a stretch.
Then again I suppose I don't have the same negative outlook because I didn't buy in at $30 and hold it all the way down. I guess it's also don't particularly give a shit about Bitcoin proper, it's a means to an end for me. I have a couple of decently successful businesses, and Bitcoin's merely a payment tool to increase profits in them.  When the value changes rapidly, those profits shrink.

Except in something as risky a BTC, you should pretty much not have a stop loss exit price. If you invest in BTC, figure that money gone - you spent it on a lottery ticket. 
With the wild swings BTC has had long term, the only thing selling does is lock in paper losses. If it turns out you're a bag holder and it'll never come up, you should be able to say "big deal". If it doesn't, you'll be kicking yourself on the next run up as it soars back past your original break even point. 
Either hold, or don't, but selling out near the bottom is the worst of both worlds - worse so than panic selling as soon as the market farts.

That's cute.
No seriously, it's really fucking adorable how people think shit like the Tea Party and whatnot all grows organically by little-guys being sick of being down-trodden, despite the fact that what they "want" and what the ultra-rich want tend to align creepily well.
It's adorable how you make giant leaps of assumption about Satoshi's motivations. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the guy was already rich and fucked off because he couldn't transfer one fiat to another without attracting controversy. I'm just saying it's not impossible and you appear to have some fat rose-colored glasses on about Bitcoin's history.
The "monied interests" may not all get Bitcoin now, and they may have to chuck out their playbook because they can no longer print money out of thin air, but Bitcoin at it's core *is fucking great for the monied elite*.

He's not getting DDoS protection, instead he's going to redirect everyone to access the site via several free web providers... What a totally bitcoin thing to do: preach about non-violent voluntary transactions, then pass your expenses off on another company without compensating them.

I dunno where you live, but assuming the US, you're hilariously wrong on many counts. This is by no means an exhaustive list. 
BTC doesn't afford you the same liability protection that incorporation does, unless your plan all along is just to fuck off with what's left of the coffers when the shit hits the fan? If anyone finds out who you are, you still bear all liability. 
Incorporation isn't required to start a business at all, except in some rare edge cases in which case BTC won't save your ass. 
If you're paying taxes on $10, get a better accountant or hit the books on tax law. Social security contributions will get you unless you have a kid, but other than that you're doing something fucking wrong to be taxed at all anywhere up to pretty much the poverty line (I'm not a tax attorney, I just play one on the Internet). 
Bitcoin lowers the bar for accepting payments, particularly where chargebacks are a real measure of concern, but they on no way simplify staying a business if government was your headache.

By "helps" what you really mean is "confuses no less than three separate issues and melds them all into one erroneous understanding of economics" - you absolutely helped!
1) Funding the mining process is a separate issue to coin injection... I mean yes, it just so happens that coin injection is the primary way that's accomplished now, and you are correct that it will likely be how it's funded at a time when the transaction fees surpass the coinbase reward. Unfortunately, the reverse isn't true - the funding mining isn't the sole reason for coin injection.
2) By "flow of money into the system" you mean "flow right back out again" as miners will edge closer and closer to break-even point in an attempt to be the last guy standing, so the vast majority of coins mined simply goes in some way or another to pay miners' operating costs.
3) You clearly don't understand the point of currency injection at all - if any new currency production means the value slides down one decimal place, why has the value of BTC been climbing despite ~3600BTC being produced per day?
4) Your final statement is just an indication that you didn't actually read and understand the thread, you just saw people talking about printing new currency and decided it's a bad thing. 
All I'm saying is that imagine a hypothetical scenario where it's possible to keep all the things that make Bitcoin great, but inject new coins into the system in an "intelligent way" so as to create mild deflation (because without a means to destroy coins you definitely don't want any inflation at all) instead of the injection rate dropping off steadily towards zero while actual use of the currency is expected to go up exponentially. Such a scenario is much better, in my humble opinion.
You are confusing currency injection with inflation, and completely missing the point.

ING as well.
And at least one of them (possibly more) will refund up to a limited number of the charges for using an out-of-network ATM, unless they all quit doing that.
I thought Chase and BoA had fees unless you had direct deposit over a certain amount each month?

I had actually discussed an idea I had for a site a while (15 years ago?) back, but upon discussing it with several knowledgeable people I came to the conclusion it violated securities laws and never did anything about it. Since that appears not to bother Bitcoiners, I'll share it here and maybe someone will have fun:
Make a game where people can sign up, get say $5k imaginary money to spend on an imaginary stock market, that reflects the real market (the real time feed necessary for this also provided a barrier to entry at the time) allowing people to see how they would have done. Obviously the imaginary trades won't affect the market, but it'd still be fun. Have leader boards and profiles and everything. 
Then to monetize it, behind the scenes an algorithm analyzes the imaginary trade data looking for reliable-looking bets (based off a user's past performance and other factors) and makes real trades for you once it reaches a certain faith threshold.

Who the fuck is saying you don't deserve it, or that it should be taken from you? This is just libertarian masturbation as far as I can see, how about a source?
My BTC position's always been rather modest - I cashed out most of it buying things with it, and never really felt comfortable pouring more money into it. When I transferred money from USD to AUD I'd considered keeping some in it because I thought it'd go up, but I didn't.
C'est la vie.

Pointing this out here, because it's repeated extremely often on SA as well. Power usage has absolutely no correlation to the effectiveness of the network as a payment processor (actually validating payments as they come through even at 7TPS could probably be done on a Raspberry Pi, I'd just about wager) - power usage only correlates to "security" of the network: if everyone on the network switched to using ASICs, and barring an attacker developing *better* ASICs than those that are out there, the power used by the network, plus a little bit more, is the power level required to mount a successful attack on the network.
That's it, whether the network performs one transaction in ten minutes or a million in ten minutes, the power usage (both electricity and computing power) doesn't change, and at least the computing power needs to keep growing (ASICs are a good thing in that respect because the computing power can grow while the electricity usage shrinks) or the network becomes weaker.
The rest of your points stand - it just goes to show that the free market can't solve every problem and that eventually some intervention is required, because market actors have absolutely no reason to care if the blockchain is too big for the average user to download and maintain.

Yeah, no, this community *is* averse to criticism of any kind. I point out that IMHO the coin distribution method and curve is undesirable, and that it's only that way (again IMHO) because there is no better alternative that remains distributed and decentralized. I get some fucking moron telling me that obviously Bitcoin is desirable because the price is going up. 
This community is full of fucking retards who will jump all over anyone who doesn't completely and utterly surrender to the kool-aid. 
News flash guys: if you have to voraciously defend every criticism, then maybe the project isn't as great as you think it is. I think it's a neat project with lots of promise, despite its flaws, and it pains me to see it stained with such complete fools as some in this community.
