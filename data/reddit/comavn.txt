Yes, lots of time. Welfare, public housing, rent protection, subsidized education, healthcare and sports.

That's.... oddly specific

I understand, that's why I mentioned a centralized banking system. Which kind of defeats the purpose of cryptocurrency IMO.
How realistic would it be to run your own intermediary node?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:23:48
You do realize what "reboot another currency" means, right?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:34:47
Could you use a segwit address as the change address for whatever your next transaction is? Then you'd only need to make one more non-segwit transaction, and you don't need to pay fees twice.

The number of UTXOs that cannot be usefully spent at the moment aren't an opinion, they're fact. It's also reasonable to assume this will hit small holders disproportionally. There's nothing emotional about that, it's an observation.
Early adopters aren't fiddling around with &lt;0.1 BTC amounts, so they won't care about fees. What's $20 if you're making millions? That was the original topic, nothing more.
Let's just agree we all hope fees will go down in the future, so it becomes a useful currency again.

All this proves is that the utility function for money isn't linear.

There's mention in the video that "Bob" in the "Alice" to "Carol" example needs to have a lot of coins to be able to do this. Is this still true? Does this limit the amount of people that can act as intermediary?

Oh, my bad, I misread the comment tree, and thought nicky_blade's comment was in reply to cryptocurrencypeople's link. You are of course correct.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:03:25
Or big, centralized banks. Oh wait.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:56:17
Not really, it's the people with &lt; 0.1BTC who are going to see their addresses become unspendable as the transaction fees rise.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:59:07
How does that change things? Does that mean people are essentially making channels to you?
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:25:28
No problems, after deduction of fees I'm at a solid loss.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:56
But all coins I want to send using my channel with steam must be dedicated to that channel beforehand, right? With a kind of timeout that gives back any unspent coins after it passed?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:05:14
It means you lose all you invested in the old currency (ie. bitcoin), and you start with a clean slate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:16:39
I have to object to cryptocurrency being anything close to easy to use and understand. There is no way the vast majority of people are going to be able to safely keep and use their coins without trusting some third party to do the hard work for them.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:07:11
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:38:05
I don't see how you wouldn't. I guess the idea is that the fees go down because the amount of transactions that need to go on the blockchain go down?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:58:00
Ah, I missed that in the lightning network video.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:35:20
Does the core reference wallet fully support segwit yet?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:35:10
What point? His jump from my concern over unspendable coins to 100% income tax?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:06:47
No it's not, semantic versioning is pretty much the standard in open source.
Edit: apparently I fail at mobile reddit, and figuring out comment trees is hard.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:13:57
Thanks, Freud.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:16:02
That's no maybe, that's probably.
But no, the man is out to ruin tofur99's fortune.
@_date: 2019-01-21 21:34:18
No and yes.
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:22:25
You do realize that mtgox went bankrupt in 2014, right? How on earth can their fake money from 4 years ago cause a 50-100x higher price now?
