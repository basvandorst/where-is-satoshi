No, the only way to truly scale crypto is via [IOTA]( which got rid of the blocks entirely in favor of their invention called 'Tangle' which got zero fees and virtually unlimited scalability.

[IOTA]( got zero fees

Actually it's the opposite. The 'Big Deal' is just the name the community gave it, the core IOTA team refused to reveal any details precisely to avoid speculation and hype, the project is not interested in false valuation at all, hence the lack of details until things are guaranteed. It's unlike any other approach in the space.

Indeed, progress march on! I love it
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:51:46
Actually [IOTA]( has invented a network that is more decentralized and got zero fees, it's being adopted by IoT.
@_date: 2016-08-13 22:10:25
Yes, exactly, except it's not even a blockchain, it's a completely new paradigm. Look at slide 4 on the main website  that's how the distributed ledger's topology looks, like a tangle, therefore it's called a 'Tangle'

So you take some known fraudster's empty statements as fact?
He did *not* invent 2FA. AT&amp;T held patent on it several years before his patent, which is why he was not granted patent rights. Additionally 2FA/MFA has been mentioned in cryptography books for a long time. So it's just another lie of his.
He absolutely did not create cloud storage either, General Magic used Cloud since the 1980s.
Please stop believing everything you hear.

In IOTA the verification of transactions is not decoupled from the network as is the case in regular blockchains. In IOTA you - the user - verify 2 previous transactions when you send one, so you are compensated by being able to use the network, and so is everyone else, thus no need for frees.
@_date: 2016-08-13 17:53:55
Yeah, for sure, just highlighting that superior technology now exist.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:50:26
That's the dumbest reasoning I have ever heard, I'd consider suicide
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:31:15
Or [IOTA]( which has absolutely zero fees and is made for exactly this.
@_date: 2016-06-18 14:43:41
Bitcoin is equally an altcoin, just because it came first does not make it 'the coin'
@_date: 2016-09-23 03:58:22
This is 100% false. [IOTA]( solves scale by dropping the blocks and the chain in favor of their own Tangle (directed acyclic graph) architecture. They are already doing way over 50 Transactions Per Second and expect to go over 1000 by the end of the year. In addition to this it is also way more decentralized (no miners) and can't be forked.

Getting rid of the blocks and the chain in favor of a more decentralized solution called Tangle invented by the IOTA team get rid of fees entirely. I see [IOTA]( as the future of payments while Bitcoin remains a holding value.
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:53:03
In my opinon [IOTA]( is the 'internet of money' since they have managed to create a 100% decentralized system (no miners) with absolutely zero fees.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:02:26
Dumbest idea I have ever heard / 10
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:09:33
Uh, did you read what I replied to? Sending miners into space = ridiculous.
I own hundreds of bitcoin, so yea.
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:46:18
You will like IOTA  which is also working on a bridge to Bitcoin. Not quite mining btc (that makes less sense than flat earth theory), but providing payment system for IoT
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:51:37
I would expect a more 'technically accurate' answer from someone like yourself Voorhees. Bitcoin is not without fees at all, how could you  claim that it is?
