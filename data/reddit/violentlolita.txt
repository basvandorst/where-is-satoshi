Well, it's perfectly legal if you have a script.
Many customers are just people looking for cheaper alternatives to the brandname pharms they are already prescribed

Came through in about a week. No issues with customs. Product is legit.

a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used for hairloss and prostate issues
my GP only wanted to offer me brandname propecia / proscar which is 5x as expensive as generics
as for whether indian generics are the same as the brandname stuff, we will see

Not very sweet for someone who just today thought he should look into buying some bitcoins, only to see they're more than double the price of what they were a month ago

Buy a bitcoin at $1100. Buy 400 altcoins at 0.0025btc. Bitcoin crashes to $650. Altcoin crashes to 0.0009btc. If you sold those altcoin, you'd now have 0.36btc. If you sold those btc, you'd now have $234, or 21% of your original investment. Yesterday my portfolio went down to around 20%, with the remainder being lost prior to the crash with various poor decisions.
But of course, i didn't panic sell and everything has recovered nicely :) I can actually see myself profiting now if btc recovers fully.

its hard to enjoy it when youre down $5k :(

What's with all the downvotes down here?
Even if the guy isn't 80, it was still a nice post. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:28:27
if you're down 150k, that implies youre already rich as fuk -_-
i know btc will recover, im more worried about my altcoins

Coinjar.io had no problems verifiying me when i used a digital bank statement.
I'd highly recommend them to any aussies looking to invest.

haha yup, i'll actually have profited when btc returns back to 1.1k+ :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:35:14
as someone who has 'lost' (i got them all back, eventually..) around $4k in various altcoins on cryptsy... the audit button does absolutely nothing

Bought 4btc at 1100. Invested all of that into various altcoins.
My altcoins are now worth ~1/2, and btc is now worth 1/2~. My portfolio value is now $1000, down from $6000+ yesterday.
I am reading gambling stories of people destroying their lives to make myself feel better.
