If we are right then hodling is the best. But if we are wrong it will be disaster in the long run.

If it doesn't confirm once it can stay in limbo for weeks. You can just resend with a new transaction instead.

Today they said to me "look, it crashed 30% over the weekend, told you so and to stay away from this pyramid shit". 
Im gonna keep my mouth closed from now on and let them be right. So sick of beeing put into defended position everytime.

People maybe see a chance to get to fiat today since the fees been decreasing all day.

As I see it this move in BTC from 7900 to 5550 can be a little EWT retracement wave 4 unless it goes under 5000.  It's a sequence with lots of "3 of 3 of 3" waves up which is a pattern found in the strongest impuls moves and has next internal up wave target at 8575.  Everything in that scenario is a part of a bigger two year old up wave 3 which has optimal targets around 63000 and one trillion $ market cap. This is not financial advice, just a pattern that I have as main scenario for my long term view on BTC.

Im just gonna hold on offline wallet and not do anything until dust settle. Then you will be sure to be on some "right chain" in the long run.
Peole seems to start expecting legacy crash right after fork. 
Expect the unexpected.

I send BTC with $0.3 fees. Take 24 hours though but I don't care. Not buying coffee with BTC. All are so in hurry to move their BTC with high fees or just stuck with the wallet solutions that got no fixed fee settings.

BCH BTC ratio down 50% in one hour ok.

Yes and my cycles point towards 63k in aug-nov next year. But I could be wrong, not betting my house on it.

Ye same here, seeing it as a possible huge roi.
The math how I do? wave lengths and fibonacci relations in time and price. It's no science though, it's an art that takes experience to get your own gut feeling about the patterns. Often people "see what they want to see" with this methods.

Np, ye I agree with you on longer term those higher targets perfectly doable if we realy are in a digital revolution about storing value because then it's about trillions like gold or fed balance sheet. Interesting times coming lol.

It used to be said that old information is already discounted in the current price. Mtgox feels pretty old info for me.

ICO is venture capital with high risk and reward. I don't think neither goverments or most of ICO investors knows what that is. 90% of those projects are suppose to fail just like in real corporate world start ups.

Yea agree on that for long term but I've been so fed up with the two latest 40% declines it's like "argh noo it looks like its time again". It realy hurts to see altcoin holdings dropping 60-70%. Well no disaster either way, since I hodl 70% of the portfolio for long term.

Don't know what a ton BTC is but it was netto bought for 140k $.

Panic sold 30% of my crypto portfolio to cash. Im completely FUD'ed up about these weekends.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:13:19
True point as it also depends on the whole sector to evolve. In stock market portfolio investors are exposed to several sectors to minimize risk. We can't do that in cryptos as it all kinda depends on blockchains be or not to be. On the other hand if it succedes it's jackpot.

"I’m investing money that i’m willing to lose" 
That's gambling, not investing. That cliche is so wrong when comparing it to calculated risk and reward investing.

BTC for $500k will give a market cap of about 8 trillion dollars which gives nearly same cap as the world supply of gold. If thinking larger we have the worlds total money supply on about 80 trillion dollars (coins, cash bank accounts, checks etc). When comparing this number then 8 trillion dollars is not much. Personally I think anything is possible considering the current experiment from central banks with their digital printing of money and negative interests.

Yea I agree with those thoughts somewhat when it's about your house or debts and such things. What I mean about the cliche beeing flawed is that it does not fit into the term investing. Having an asset or a portfolio with 100% down risk is pure gambling. Many handle cryptos as gamble hoping to hit the moon and therefore have to risk it all but still calls it investing. For me it's about retirement savings and Im absolutely not willing to lose it so I hope to manage risk properly by diversifying and holding cash sometimes. 
For example say if I would ask a manager for a stock market investing fund "are you ready to lose it all?" he would probably shake his head and say "uhm no, I diversify buying over ten different assets and increase my cash position when the market turns down so there's absolutely no risk that I will lose it all". And he also would be fired if it was confirmed by the risk management team that he was risking it all.
It's just that people write this flawed cliche all the time in investing forums. Investing is about expected returns, not about 100% down risks.
