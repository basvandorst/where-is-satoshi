You can either set an IRA like you mentioned or just buy into funds in regular account. But that doesn't have the tax advantages of an IRA.
I have a Roth because I expect tax rates to go up in the future and I'd rather pay income tax at my current rate. There's only so much you can put in for each year to a Roth, so if you want to invest a lot you might have multiple accounts, one Roth, one something else.

Western governments are nothing like the level of control some people give religious leaders.
That being said, if I don't believe in a law I disobey it.

If only America was purely capitalist, there wouldn't be so much federal grant money driving up the cost of tuition. America's at least a little bit socialist.

Bloomberg radio is doing this as well, Bitcoin price alongside the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones.

I was thinking, it's definitely a regionalism. In the Northeast you hear "by accident" but further south I have heard more "on accident".

I doubt you'll find a lot of Keynesians in a sub dedicated to a deflationary currency.

There's a reason it's so high, call it growing pains, people are trying to find a good solution but having trouble agreeing on one. Because yes, the fees have gotten too high recently.

Damn dude, that's 3 new things at once. Pick one to begin with. Installing Linux on an old computer is the easiest, I recommend starting there. Ubuntu.com.

Bitcoin, and everything else built on public key cryptography, is broken when that happens. Everyone with a need for computer security will freak out. The banks, the military, VPNs, all are compromised.
Don't worry, that's likely years away :)

This is like when I go out to dinner and pay the whole check with my credit card, and have friends give me cash for their portion. $0 ATM withdrawal :)
(Of course, you should never pay ATM fees anyway)

Figure that out, and you can mine Bitcoin easier than everyone else.
So far, the answer is no. 
I'm guessing GP wrote a script to hash different strings and stop when it gets 4 zeros. That script is basically a Bitcoin mining algorithm.

You might try contacting the college IT department if you think the answer or keys are in the old mailbox. They could have an old tape backup. It might even be worth it to you to pay them for this service.

I bet your friends give you a lot of grief for that.

Remember that the ownership of gold was banned in 1933. I'm sure people kept some but on the whole it was pretty effective at driving the legal market out.

If you need the money, cash it out. If you can afford to gamble a bit and want to get in on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, hang on to it for a month or two.
Edit: if you are paying interest on that credit card, definitely cash out. That's a guaranteed loss, Bitcoin gains is never going to outrun credit card interest.

It's a way you can lose more money than you put in.

Eh, the fact the irs only accepts dollars gives the dollar value. The US government will get explodey if you try to sell oil for any currency other than dollars, anywhere on Earth. 2/3 of $100 bills are overseas, the US government isn't giving up its world reserve currency status anytime soon. So much power and free money comes with that status.

It seems you are aware that this is a high risk and unpredictable market, which is good- I hope you are not investing more than 5-10% of your net worth, because the price of Bitcoin could crash in August.
Disclaimers out of the way, what you do depends on how you think the market will react. Right now, there's uncertainty, so prices are low. I'm buying more before August 1, I think that however this resolves, prices will go up within a few years. They might be low for a bit if the block chain splits.
Bitcoin you buy before a split will exist on both block chains. If you buy after a split, it will be on only one. If it does split, who knows which chain will maintain value. Look at Etherium versus Etherium Classic for an example of a fork/split.

That's also just classic baby boomer ignorant confidence. Don't worry, they'll all be dead or at least retired soon enough.

Considering that strong cryptography used to be considered a munition by that same government, you betcha it's possible.
Look up DeCSS for another example of a banned string.
