Hi people not new but collecting some tips !!
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:56:31
It may seem so but remember the true nature of bitcoin ie. It's limited availability , yes big corporations will do mine all of the left bitcoin, but they still need to have value right???
It will then only make sense to distribute it as then only will it's value increase!!!
A newbie so please mind my mistakes if any.

Hey this what I initially thought and build up the most basic config :-
|Part |Qty.|Price|
|Raspberry Pi 3b+ Combo|1|70$|
|500 GB internal hard drive|1|25$|
|Casing for hard drive |1| 10$|
The combo has 16 GB SD card, Casing in black or red (bonus your name on it??), power adapter and cable, HDMI cable(1.5m) and Ethernet cable.
The project comes to be 105$ and maybe few extras we can expect it to be 120$ excluding shipping.
What do you think??

Any day !

Here the crypto scene is improving . A.LOT. 5 years ago when i was just a teen I couldn't even buy bitcoin easily. 
But now bitcoin, litecoin and all others are very easy to buy from very little amounts also !!!
