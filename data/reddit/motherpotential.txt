I understand the liquidation part, but is it just assumed most would buy back bitcoin at the higher price in order to continue using the platform? What happens if some of them just choose not to buy back and get banned from using the platform?  Is that generally considered a negligible percentage?

Me too! I think they (Square Cash) automatically cut you off after your first load. It sucks because they don't tell you what's wrong or if it's because of KYC (which it's not supposed to be, because withdrawals are a separate KYC process).  So unwieldy.

We were told by ledger that all previous ledger hacks required physical access to the device to work. We were then told that even if your computer were compromised, nobody could steal your coins because everything is on the ledger hardware. We now know that neither of these need to be true, because the hack can still occur in software. Everyone needs to be a lot more cautious from now on.  Ledger and hardware wallets aren't the end all (which is what I frequently hear trumpeted after a major hack).

Would this have any benefit on a nano s? Does trezor use a different system than nano? I thought all hardware wallets used deterministic hierarchial wallets or whatever so why does it matter how many wallets there are at one time from an attack perspective? How does it reduce the attack surface?

Yes, I like this diagram better.  I don't think I could spend $8000 on a cart of groceries unless I went to Whole Foods and bought 40 pounds of salmon.

If you move all the funds from a re-used address to a new address, does this provide the same level of resistance against private key attacks from a public address? Or is there some increased vulnerability if an attacker assumes you are simply moving funds from one address with a private key to another address that is in that same wallet and has the same private key?

  How do you feel about price trajectory within the next few months? If we break 8000 downwards, we still have a lot of support at 6k right?

What's the difference between going long without leverage and buying bitcoin with cash? Genuinely asking, aren't they approximately the same thing?

I know lots of people think mainstream adoption will be soon, but how many brick and mortar stores actually accept bitcoin and have done so for a few years?  Should we consider Apple Pay and Android Pay mainstream?  They're far from universal.  I would consider it mainstream when its been accepted at Target/Walmart stores for a few years.  Some businesses go back and forth on accepting bitcoin, and I would consider it mainstream when it's not rare for people in Middle America to use it at a nationally-recognized store.

Does he have a family and kids? That would probably be an important consideration.  Single, I would probably take a lot more risk as long as I can drive to work and sleep somewhere at night.

Can someone explain this part of the article:
"Everyone learns all the different ways in which funds could have been spent, which can, for example, reveal what kind of wallet was used and perhaps even more."
How can your wallet type be revealed?
