GRS coin was actually the first to do segwit if you want to be fair.. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:56:40
it was implemented from that whole "we will do segwit now and 2x later" that proved to be bullshit. same dudes were wearing the UASF and NO2X hats
it was implemented on litecoin because its a semi-centralized shitcoin with u/coblee at the heel of the masters . He since bailed on his own litecoin toy..
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:42:59
so first you would pay $30 to open a channel (probably through a centralized hub that could or could not require AML/KYC) to then be able yo pay for a taxi. That would wotk even better when you dont give a shit and just want to use a cab once in a place you will never be at again. 
and then close that channel for $30.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:24:56
What bs, sir? 
1 cent tx fees and a timely confirmation? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:43:13
bi-directional payment channels DO work. I don't deny it. 
But i will be skeptical until i see it working in the wild as is being preached like its some kind of the coming of the messiah. 
I know you like ignoring it but even the LN whitepaper says LN would need over 130mb blocks to work on global scale. And there are many glaring problems with LN that are being ignored. Just type Lightning Network in google it will show you right away no need to even look. 
But why get technical? Have faith! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:22:34
You too brother.
and like a core dev said: have faith! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:42:48
We don't have LN yet. Are you from 18 months in the future? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:36:34
GREAT argument from you, sir. Valid reasons and all. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:24:04
my point is still valid. I don't care if 99% of people jump of a bridge..
to Sacrificie layer 1 to force people to hold money on exchanges due to the fees is pretty sketchy. My money is on my ledger and I want to transact with it directly without worrying some shit exchange decides to freeze my account or give my info to the IRS. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:16:49
everyone talks about LN like it is the coming of the messiah
 
IT DOESN'T EXIST YET. How can they integrate it? 
Besides, I thought we love decentralization. Huge hubs with KYC/AML is not quite bitcoin..
Another thing is that LN acts like a prepaid debit account. Nobody will open a $30 channel to then buy a steam game once. That defeats the point  or any savings. 
Asking people to preload money of unknown large amount for an unknown amount of time doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:27:40
No. That's not really how LN works. 
Making exchanges a mandatory part of LN is a huge problem though. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:58:43
using exchanges as hubs brings us back to the banking industry we are suppoedly trying to avoid. 
This is definition of centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:44:46
Do you understand economies of scale? It is guaranteed LN hubs will become centralized as it totally makes sense. 
I am very skeptical of betting the farm on a technology that doesn't work yet in the real world but only on incomplete simulations. 
I am worried about centralization of LN hubs in order to use bitcoin more than node centralization on btc or bch. Don't ignore the fact that most of btc harshrate comes from bitmain miners in china either. 
Your "bcash" argument is useless. How and where did i shill or even mention "bcash"? I been using and preaching bitcoin since 2010. You? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:25:08
and Schnorr will only apply to new transactions so if your balance is lower than the fees you are still screwed. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:52
hahahah they are more clever than you!
they know they can't spend that shit with the fees ������
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:38:04
Core said: if you don't like it, fork.
I also love your reply. 
Nobody is advocating for only on-chain  scaling. Obviously layer 2 has a lot of great applications. HOWEVER, it should never come at the expense of being able to transact directly peer to peer. 
you do realize for LN to function needs much bigger blocks than 1mb, right?
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:53:55
and you will need to pay a fee each time to open and close channels on LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:06:08
what do you mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:29:04
you were talking about IOT, and i said IOTA will take care of that, or atleast planning to. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:32:40
again, I said how is this going to help them if they still need to pay to open and close a channel. 2 on-chain transactions. This is more than these giftcards are worth!
I know once they have that set up they can send almost free. 
Or you think its acceptable that they will be usefull when we reach 100% segwit and LN penetration in thr uknown future?
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:21:52
Can't increase the blocksize now. It will have to be a hardfork. Miners will block it. Guaranteed. If it forks without almost 100% of hashpower it will split the chain with the smaller block version with minority hashrate. 
Only option is a POW change, but that will still split the chain..
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:45:45
what is the incentive for that "Fuck Bitcoin Cash" miner to waste his resources to fuck bch vs honestly mining on the BTC chain to make profits? That lost opportunity might cost them minimum 12.5 btc + fees.
I don't know the numbers on double spends with or without rbf but making rbf a common thing will only add to escalating fees and more unreliable transactions. this has to do mostly with the maxed out blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:17:09
I kinda like using the actual chain.. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:50:21
i have to call BS on this one. 
double spends are much harder on bch because RBF is disabled and blocks are not maxed out as of now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:55:04
Lightning is actually going to be layer 3 with a layer 2 currently being worked on.. that's how difficult LN is to impelement right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:31:14
You will have to provide hard proof for me to believe that regarding asicboost. 
I would believe that BCH is/was hedge against failure of the btc chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:40:20
wait for LN
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:52:52
You need miners to be overwhelmingly onboard for that. they were with s2x but that got shelved. So don't expect any blocksize increase any time soon. 
if you try to fork to a larger blocksize without almost 100% of hashpower behind you then it will split the chain. You probably don't want that. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:48:12
so you mean €20? 
lol. This is not very practical with these fees. Wait a bit and give them LN gift cards
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:02:56

@_date: 2017-12-29 20:35:08
Bitcoin: peer to peer electronic cash system. 
I'd be damned if it becomes "Bitcoin: peer to peer electronic cash i hope Poloniex and Bittrex don't get hacked so my channels don't get screwed system" 
mandatory as in we will need to them to be hubs for liquidity. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:49:03
you are simulating a perfect and balanced scenario. It will never be the case and you are looking at maybe many years down the road!
Highly misleading!
In theory scientista discovered atomic entaglement so you can "teleport to the moon" but wtf you can't claim moon teleportation is at 100% success with humans today!
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:44:44

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:42:05
Did you even read what i wrote? 
and what is this obsession with Ver? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:12:13
we can also blame Ver and Asicboost 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:59:33
you are talking about a serious 51% attack on the network and not double spend that cheats you out of the money. I can't comment because it has never been done on btc or bch and if it was that easy it would have been done. 
maxed out blocks with rbf though, can screw someone because the transaction gets stuck in the mempool if you send with a low fee and appears as pending in the other persons wallet. and then you rebroadcast with a higher fee and cheat him. Easier with maxed out block where it takes longer than 10 mins to confirm. 
with bch you cant rbf so if it shows as pending it probably is good to go (0 conf)
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:01:46
yea in 2001 i was not expecting i will be using up 500gbs a month to watch tv shows and downloading stuff on my $1000 laptop that is 20x better than my desktop in 2001. 
in 10 years the numbers you wrote my not seem absurd at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:43:10
I read all of that when it just came out. I still don't believe it. What proof is there? That the failed KNC miner believed Wu was somehow cheating? 
Bitmain is still mining segwit bitcoin and their s9's make up like 70% of the hashpower (need citation but its close). How did BCH benefit them at the moment? If they had asicboost, they still do. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:19:48
Their business is not viable with high fees period. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:24:58
THIS is exactly what I mean that if you want LN to have enough liquidity and users then AML/KYC will be mandatory eventually just like Visa or Mastercard.
It all makes sense since MC is an investor in Blockstream and Lightning Labs..
Exactly the bitcoin i signed up for in 2010. /s 
Oh and if you want on-chain the peer-to-peer style then cough up $30+ 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:01:13
u should be banned for shilling an altcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:50:28
you are confusing a credit card with a debit card/checking account first of all..
"Why would I close it except for when I want to get the funds back for other reason"
how many years you think it will take for your scenario to be true?
you might want to read about time value of money too..
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:34:20
requires 1 onchain tx to open and 1 to close. You go ahead and open/close your channels all day erryday. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:50:06
I am critical as i should be with my money! 
you forgot the inconvenient one, 4. 1mb is choking the mainchain. LN whitepaper even stresses blocks need to be far bigger than 1mb to be of any global use. 
As I always said. Layer 2/3 (LN is now 3) are great for certain applications. No doubt. 
I hope in a year from now something drastic gets done to address rising fees and network congestion. Must be combination of  larger blocks, efficiency improvements or off-chains solutions. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:03:19
how does it benefit the "leaders"? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:32:45
so where do  you get the liquidity? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:26:15
segwit was pitched as opt-in..
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:47:25
-$30 fees
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:28:16
end result will be so many layers and middlemen on top of bitcoin that they will just get rid of it like they did with gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:33:00
$30 to open and $30 to close channels (and growing). 
So yeah. Might be interesting if your money gets locked for 5 days on top of that too. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:11:07
Are we discussing religion here? 
You don't know how it will work but you have faith, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:31:36
how can i fear it if it doesn't exist :)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:56:31
There is always trust with 3rd parties. You always have to trust them with as much money as they are managing on your behalf. Unless you will be always online with your channels than you are trusting them. You sacrifice trustlessness for convenience. 
if a major hub gets such "denial of service" attack / node goes offfline then you will feel ripples across all channels. You will not lose the btc but it will be messy. 
or am i getting something wrong ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:50:30
Ahh the goold ole' "when we get there, technology will be there" argument --- LN will be ready in 18 months. Have faith and pay the $30 fee!
did I do it right? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:16:59
"the worst thing that will happen is that your channel will not be accessible when you need it"
yea why would anyone care about reliable transactions and having control of your money! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:47:55
so almost like bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:32:59
if fees don't go down there will be nobody to use your potential LN channel as a service. Also, do you have hundreds of bitcoins to stake to become a node? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:09:22
A channel must be funded to be useful.  That means a large hub, a supernode, will need to fund all of its channels, fronting potentially vast amounts of money to avoid channel interruptions. You can lock up your coins to do "proof of stake" for that. 
listen i am not sure how all this will play out since it doesn't exist in the wild yet but that's the gist of it as far as i understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:27:28
I can send you bitcoin directly right now with no middlemen. Stop saying nonsense.
I can also send it to anyone else in the world. If you are going to waste all the energy atleast this has a point. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:04:09
and how is LN going to help? They will still need to pay to open and close channels
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:05:12
nothing is stopping the bch chain of making layer 2 as well. There are many ways to go about it not just what Lightning Labs are doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:46:50
Increasing the native blocksize requires a hardfork like what Segwit2x was going to be. That will be really hard to do even if Core puts it on their roadmap after big miners got pissed off with all the drama around S2X. If btc gets forked without overwhelming miner support, then it will cause a chain split and lots of chaos.
