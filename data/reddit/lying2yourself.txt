Where did I say that again?  All I said was it would require a fuck ton of users to accomplish, which is true.  I never said they'd need to pony up 130 billion.
But that's ok, let me know how those 10k coins work out for you.  Surely the 14 month trend is reversing, we've reached the bottom!  This time is totes different than the last 5 bottoms we reached.  This time it's real!

Why don't you show a current chart?  Even with the log graph [it's obvious]( bitcoin's price is no longer following an exponential trend.  Also the scale on your chart is a complete joke.

The price is making new lows every second it's @ $206 on Bitfinex.  Stop lying.

Or the speculation will die down and the price will settle at a fair market value of ~$10.  It'll then be used for the only thing that bitcoin is good for:  all things illegal.

Wow such wisdom can be applied to many things including but not limited to my cock.

Wow for only $2,000 you will make a tiny change on a digital ledger for me?  In doing so you will enter me into a currency with the highest inequality as far as wealth distribution in the world?  A currency whose distribution is so uneven, it makes the United States 1% look like a completely balanced and fair option?  A currency which is so unevenly distributed that 3rd world dictatorships are jealous?  A currency which is doing worse than currencies in 3rd world war torn countries?  A currency who won the worst performing currency award in 2014 and 2015?

Look, my drug problem has nothing to do with this..

That was your dignity.

Dangerously hilarious fad.

Bitcoin lost 85% from peak.  Are you saying you'd rather put your money in bitcoin, or is this post just totally off topic?

That's because you are standing next to him cupping his ball sack.

If the hash power drops significantly than anyone with a significant hashing power now is going to have an even more powerful one with a low hash rate.

So to the people losing their house, car, and life savings it doesn't matter?  Not at all?
Oh that's right, you throw in the disclaimer "don't invest more than you can afford to lose" and then proceed to tell them how if they invest now they will be rich and any money they put in now will be rewarded 100 fold and they will be living on private islands.  "BUT DON'T INVEST MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE, WINK WINK WINK"
Nope, totally not a get rich quick scheme though - you'll surely all be rich within 5 years by paying someone to swap a few numbers in a digital ledger in 2015.  Totes a legit investment strategy!

For now it does but it could very well not work so well if the price drops enough.  It's something that should be addressed before it happens.  Just like the scalability.  Why should anyone take bitcoin serious if they allow this to happen?
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:39:39
So this is good for bitcoin then?
