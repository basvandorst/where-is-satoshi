I stopped making Bitcoin my life some time ago, I have better things to do than to dig through code and get my pants in a bunch because they didn't name a variable how I would.  Tesla's P90D has a "ludicrous" mode.  That's not professional! The P90D must then be a piece of unprofessional junk!
Besides, isn't BU a fork from Core?  If so, your statement "things you do from the beginning" is either not very accurate, or plain wrong because a lot of the precedence was set by non-BU devs.


I don't know why things were overlooked, you probably don't either.  Instead you're making a bunch of assumptions and assertions to fit your narrative.  That's fine, but I'm not willing to accept it as fact.


So you're saying that some technical nuance wasn't overlooked 4 years ago when the fork happened? Was it supposed to be there? Did they consciously say "Hey, let's make this thing fuck up real bad on purpose!"  Probably not.  The devs are human and made a mistake.  The BU devs are human and made a mistake too.


How many of the more active devs were devs in 2013?  When you run the bitcoin executable, what are you typing into your command line, bitcoin-core?
I'm agnostic, I run both a core and a BU node.  I don't prescribe to "side".  This shit has been stupid for far too long and stuff like this isn't helping.
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:48:20
I'm going to disagree, there were a lot of technical people that raised those concerns back then, and there have since I've been involved since 2011.
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:53:43
Someone who isn't me or you did the legwork.  There are 23 developers who are active contributors that commit less than trivial changes.
Maybe I can go fix a typo and commit the change and then be a "core dev".


How ironic.  Consider taking your own advice.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:05:22


A lot more than the price has changed since I started following Bitcoin (2011).   
To address transaction times in my Bitcoin 'x' statement: transacations were pretty much guaranteed to be in the next block regardless of fee (or lack thereof).  Aged coins didn't require a fee at all and were considered "high priority".  You could reasonably rely on 0-conf transactions, that they wouldn't be replaced and they would be included in the next block.
As for core function: Bitcoin more-or-less operates in exactly the same manner, but outside of that Bitcoin is, in many, many ways significantly different.  These differences aren't just limited to Bitcoin itself, but include the community and the average participant.
@_date: 2017-02-25 15:46:24

Doesn't that just count nodes with open ports?  Can't I just make 1000 nodes and skew that number?
You also didn't tell me how how many nodes = decentralization and how many nodes = decentralization is lost.
Also the issue isn't the hardware, it's the bandwidth of the connection, isn't it?

Hardly, but developers made Litecoin, and vertcoin, and whatever other coin.  Why don't those coins have a 16BN market cap? They all have developers, don't they?  Well maybe it's because its the users and speculators that have poured their money into it, not the devs.    
Fuck man,  you need to take a break and collect your thoughts or something.
@_date: 2017-02-18 05:49:35
You're right. In the truest sense it's not a market cap, but it is the term the Bitcoin industry is using to define the apparent value so I'm going with it.


I'm not trolling. I'm speaking what I perceive to be the truth.  Don't like it? I don't give a shit.

No it does not.  If I go and upgrade my copy of winrar does that mean I am consciously supporting some side of a development war I have no idea exists?
How is it not clear to you that there are a lot of people out there using Bitcoin that have no clue there is a scaling war going on?  That not every single person that has installed the reference client visits the standard communications channels and is involved?  Or know that alternative clients even exist?

Indeed it appears to have more support, however more != majority, which is what you originally claimed.

Oh, yes, I am sorry.  It was "decentralized consensus", wasn't it?  
Point is: Bitcoin doesn't have a market cap because you, Greg Maxwell, or any other of the Core group is a part of it.  People before you, and you, to some degree, built the foundation.  But it's the people who use it that have made it worth a $ figure.  If it wasn't for them, you and your friends would be sitting around with your dicks in your hand trading worthless tokens back and forth.
Edit: 


You're not becoming "stupider", you're just starting to be aware of it.  You're still the same level of stupid that thought it was a good idea to pre-order hardware from Hashfast.

Probably. Maybe in time BU will learn the lessons that QT/core did in the same fashion.  My opinion is that it's silly to look down on others for making a mistake you yourself made.  Did the QT/Core developers "lose all credibility?" No they did not. However,  I do agree it's a bit amateur, but *a lot* of going-ons with Bitcoin is pretty amateur.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:44:42
Yes, and the majority is not signalling for either.   Taking your example in the context of this conversation I am arguing that the majority in this case is Person A, which your example agrees with.  However, OP is implying that person B has the majority because he's conveniently ignoring the existence of Person A.

If so then it must be a mix of real/fake mining.  GAW couldn't actually show proof of hash *anywhere*.  GBMiners must have a least some percentage of their claimed HW if they can mine BU blocks.

Really it's your failure to understand the meaning of the words you're using.  I'm not changing context, I'm merely pointing out that you're judging a book by its cover instead of thinking critically.
Definiton of software developer: 
"A software developer is a person concerned with facets of the software development process, including the research, design, programming, and testing of computer software"
So, core **dev** implies core developer.  Or, software developer. Which, btw, making trivial comment/document changes does not garner you the title.


No. What you've stated is that a bunch of people have made commits, not that they have researched, designed, programmed, or tested anything. Which, by my understanding, is a prerequisite to having the title "developer".


AWS errors most likely.  Rehosted: 


Again, perhaps if you understood the meaning of the words you chose to use then we wouldn't have this problem, would we?

No, I am saying the idea that "intelligent engineers don't band-aid" is stupid, they do it all the time.  Case in point, SW is, IMO, a partial band-aid.  While I am not against the concept of SW per se, SW is also kicking the can down the road.  It does not "solve" block size/weight issues either.  It is an enabler for LN, sure, but w.r.t. "block size" it is also a can kick.   We need both on-chain and off-chain scaling, and SW doesn't *fix* on-chain scaling for the long-term.

That's my point.  I think they're adding support for SW in the event that it is activated, but not that they would refuse to go BU if the longest chain with the most work (read: Bitcoin) goes with BU.

I'm no one special, really. I have been following Bitcoin since 2010, but involved since 2011/2012.  I was a fairly large miner in the days of GPUs and early ASICS. I made a new account because my previous was 7 years old and was riddled with crumbs that would help people ascertain my real identity and I value my privacy.


I agree, or, at the very least make it damn clear that your statements may be inaccurate due to lack of access to information.


Definitely a reason for no fiat withdrawals, but I'd argue that we still don't know the reason.  Was it because of the banks? Was it because of the fucked up BTC balance sheet?  We still don't know, with certainty *when* the BTC went missing.


Agree completely.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:57:59
You know better than that.  Subsidy was halved and price doubled.  Net change = ZERO.  Add increasing difficulty: Net change = NEGATIVE.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:21:22
You're being trolled, idiot.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:51:59
IIRC it's a configurable option (soft-limit).  A miner who finds a block always gets the subsidy.  I suppose you would have to have a block that is *at least* large enough to contain the coinbase tx.  There is no penalty for mining blocks smaller than the hard coded limit with the exception of missing out on tx fees.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:29:59
Eth is different than Bitcoin.  A minority chain can easily be manipulated to death.  Just ask luke-jr how he aided and abetted the death of early altcoins.

@_date: 2017-03-25 18:13:10
There are more producers of ASICS than just those two.
Also it was recently brought to my attention that Bitfury is selling chips to 3rd party manufacturers (e.g. hotmine.io), so that argument is quickly becoming flase.
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:11:04

@_date: 2017-03-05 07:42:26
Yeah, he fucked that up pretty bad, lol.  Although the concern at the time was that they had no USD (fiat withdrawals were fucked up for awhile) and that's what he was reporting on... their bank balance.
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:43:05

@_date: 2017-03-16 17:48:22
People really suck at realizing that tomorrow is different than today.  Just because *today* Core has more activity doesn't guarantee that *tomorrow* BU won't.
I personally don't care which side edges out, but it blows my mind that people are so closed to the possibility the the status quo may change.  Especially given the fact that for most metrics we can see that it is happening.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:53:12


I think this is an important piece of the puzzle.
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:30:25
We can agree to disagree, but Bitcoin is the longest chain with the most work.  If it (BU) gains majority miner support and is activated, it *is* Bitcoin.  Core would have to then complete a "dangerous" hardfork to change the PoW algorithm and reduce difficulty which would likely result in creating two more chains (3 total) and would become the/two alt-coins.
Whether you personally believe that it's unlikely is irrelevant.  There exists the possibility and it'd be best to heed that.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:23:45
I disagree.  My understanding is that any miner can announce what size *they will accept*, that doesn't mean that is the size of block that will be made.  Also, unless I am misunderstanding, there is still a technological limit of 32MB as is the case with the original Satoshi client.


You're the one playing with words.  The name is not indicative of the technological reality.

People who only know of Bitcoin as 'y' don't understand becaus they never knew 'x'. 'Y' bitcoin people believe 'x' Bitcoin people should go use something else whereas 'x' bitcoin people think 'y' bitcoin people should fuck right off and go build their own 'y' or use something that is/was already 'y' instead of turning bitcoin 'x' into bitcoin 'y'.

Protip: the "Unlimited" in Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't mean unlimited sized blocks.  
I can see how one would get confused by the awkward name choice.  Anyways, A miner could fill the SW blocks with their own free transactions, and no, a user can't unless a miner chooses to mine those free transactions, which they won't because why would they when there are a bunch of other people willing to pay for access to the limited block space.  As for LN, while I havent played with it myself I do hear about hub operators getting fees which implies that both miners *and* users will have to pay them.  Of course when opening and closing a channel the user will have to pay fees and the miner doesn't as long as they are mining their own blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:12:37

You also make these ridiculous assertions that Bitmain is somehow controlling end-user sentiment because of "priority, discount, and availability".    It appears like you have no factual basis to *any of this*, it's just crap you came up with.

20MB blocks may be a valid argument in the sense that in 2012 you could have 1MB blocks but (almost?) every miner was soft-limiting the size much lower.  Miners could just soft-limit to 2MB while the coded max is 20.

Every new breed of Bitcoin user is dumber than the last.
Some years ago Reddit sold "mould" which, when you bought it for a user would "kill" one of the letters of their keyboard.  Enough mould and you couldn't participate in a conversation whatsoever.  Perhaps the forums should introduce something similar, but with address age.  The older the address you can sign a message with, the more letters you get.  Make it super interesting where you have to have a *really* old address to get the vowels.

What an interesting comment.  "Bitfury George" is aligned with Bitfury the ASIC manufacturer.  They build their own HW, which they don't sell to you the, the little guy.  They do not buy HW from Bitmain, who btw *will* sell HW to you, the little guy.  If Bitmain goes with BU, they will no longer be the (unsubstantiated) majority controller of Core, this guy, "Bitfury George" will be.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:18:20
What happens if, in the future, Core decides to hard fork?  Will that also be a "new asset" if there majority of users and miners don't agree?  What happens to the "new asset" if BU splits and then the Core chain outgrows the BU chain and then BU reorgs into the Core chain?
Anyways, the OP should have included the constraint that the split has to be contentious, which of course BU's fork would be at this time.  However, should that change, BU will, by their own definition become Bitcoin.

Then you should recall that the issue Mt. Gox was having is that they weren't processing FIAT withdrawals and claimed banking problems.  So Ver went over there, looked at the bank statements and sure enough, there was a lot of fiat in the accounts.  So the money *was* there, and that's what he was reporting on.  What we didn't know is that Gox was majorly insolvent on the BTC balance sheet, which is what ultimately brought the operation down.  However, there is definitely an argument that the withdrawals weren't being processed *by choice* not because of banking issues, but it doesn't change the fact that fiat wasn't moving out, but there was fiat in the accounts.  That's what Ver was reporting.
He totally fucked the whole thing up, but I don't think he was lying *per se* as everyone is quick to jump on.
I'm not sure how I feel about Ver, but I know that a lot of people here are jumping on a poorly built bandwagon because it fits their bias.

In my opinion, yes.  The motivation for the statement is based off the premise that someone/people are "spamming" the network to creat backlog and high fees so that it can be used as a reason why we need to increase the transaction capacity *right now*.  If you support Core then of course you would say that we need to activate SW to fix this, and if you support BU you would say we need to HF to that to fix it.
At the end of the day the argument "works" for both sides, and both sides have shown the capability and wilingness to play dirty.

@_date: 2017-03-25 17:28:57
I haven't fullly thought this through, but would'nt completely filled SW blocks only yield a theoretical maximum of a 25% increase in fees?  I say theoretical because my understanding is, is that it is unlikely that the 3MB of witness space will ever be full.
A straight block size doubling would increase potential fees by 100%.
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:05:19
IMO they're right... if it were 2010.  My interpretation is that "Satoshi consensus" included the concept that if you ran a full node, you would also be mining.  The old clients had that built in.  SPV nodes were foreseen and in using them you wouldn't be mining and thus forfeit your vote.  Things have changed and modern consensus is clearly, IMO, both the miners and "economic" nodes.

WTF are you talking about?  If I have SW 'A' where the discount does not exist, and I have SW 'B' where the discount does AND I have the exact same transaction set for my next block I will *most definitely* get more in fees with SW 'A' then I will with SW 'B'.
The only scenario where this doesn't apply is where all TXs for inclusion are not multisig, or not using SW addresses.

As dishonest as claiming that SW is 2MB without also stating the caveat that you must use SW style transactions?
Imagine the shit storm if Segwit were activated tomorrow but blocks only increased marginally because the plebiscite were under the impression that it was a block size increase, in the same manner that a 2MB BS HF would be.  "But *you told us* SW was 2MB!".

So perhaps the "They" that you believe are "flip-flopping" aren't the same people, but different people that all frequent the sub that you're lumping together as a "they".
I see this misconception happen all of the time on reddit, not just w.r.t. BTC or its fractured communities.  People are like "man, reddit really hates X" as if reddit was a singular being.

So the real answer is no.  The very next block would not be 2MB.
Perhaps we can stop being disingenuous when we decry that it's a defacto 2MB block.  The reality is that it will only be a 2MB *given* that people start using Segwit style transactions.  In fact, being honest would allow you to say that if all transactions were Segwit that that 2MB would actually be closer to 4MB.
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:39:53
I wonder what the drop would have been if blocks were limited to 1MB.  Presumably the only reason these dumps are as deep as they are is because the Bitcoin Cash chain has enough space for all of those dumpers to move their coins.

This right here is the reason miners would discourage people like OP from doing all of this.  If you have the equipment already for other purposes and have excess power, then that's different.  But buying a bunch of solar gear *just* to mine is a total waste of money.

Why would the miners wait for libraries and wallets?  Shouldn't it be the other way around?  
Miner goes first-&gt; I will accept your transactions if they are SW, or are not.
Wallet goes first-&gt; I will make segwit transactions, but they won't go anywhere because the miners won't process them.
I guess there's the argument that mining outfits don't want to put in the work of upgrading if the wallets and libraries aren't going to support it... But then why should the libraries and wallets support it if the miner's aren't going to?
Chicken and egg problem I suppose.

That's a great question, and one that's hard to answer especially given that it's dependent on the end-user's HW.  Personally I'd draw the line at a couple months on hardware that's a SD below the mean of 5 year old consumer grade HW.
I mean, two months *sounds* ridiculous but keeping in mind what the blockchain and Bitcoin represents I think it's a fair tradeoff.
That's just my opinion that I came up with while writing this post.  Perhaps if I gave it more thought (or had more data/input) I would change my view.

No one should be "in power".  And there is no reason that people can't and/or won't start working off the BTC1 chain.  It is open source afterall.  Core developers aren't under some sort of contract nor are there any no competition clauses in existence, afaik.  
Developers who are in it for the technology and the potential promise to mankind are free to work with whatever group they choose.  No reason that they can't choose to work off the BTC1 repo instead of the Core repo if it becomes the dominant implementation.  Some may leave, some may stay, I don't really care.  


I disagree. I think it's borne out of Core's failure to lead in the space.  Miners clearly want on-chain scaling and have begged/pleaded/compromised to try and get Core to abide.  Core didn't, so they got together and are creating it because Core won't.  There is *nothing wrong* with this, IMO.

@_date: 2017-01-20 18:33:37


I think you have a fair opinion in the matter.  Personally I don't care that there will be a few left behind.  That's the reality of the world.  If we need to have *every participant* on board then we all need to concede the what Bitcoin is now is what it will forever be.
FWIW, the soft-fork of SW also leaves some behind.  Old nodes can't fully validate every transaction.  That considered, I'd argue anyone who's running an old node (think &lt;0.10) has chosen to be left behind, so why should progress be held up because of that?  The soft-fork just allows those people to pretend they're part of the network whereas the hard fork, as we all know, makes it concrete unless they upgrade, at which point they're saying "Yes, I'd still like to be a part of this thing".  I'm okay with that.
To each their own.

He also created the Bitcoin Store, the first (afaik) online retailer to take Bitcoin, and more interestingly *only* Bitcoin.  He also paid for billboard advertisements in California... Silicon Valley maybe? He was also a common guest on internet talk shows to educate and spread the word of Bitcoin.  He was also an angel/initial investor in a lot of the larger Bitcoin companies that you know today.
Roger Ver actually did *a lot* for Bitcoin.  So much so that he earned the title of "Bitcoin Jesus", despite hating the title.
So even though a lot of people disagree with him, the way he approaches things, etc, he has done a whole hell of a lot more for Bitcoin than most everyone in this sub.

Of course it is, especially when the contributor is a BTC proponent and early adopter.  He's not AXA, GS, etc.  


Which is exactly my point.  They do. What has Samson Mow done in this regard?


I am not.  It's what came to mind.  The largest dollar valuation to the FEE was made in Bitcoin.  That's a lot better for spreading the knowledge of the power and value of BTC than BS twitter posts that "reach people".


Source for that?  Were they *his* pennies, or someone elses?  Big difference.


I work in a Business environment.  Meetings are the single biggest waste of people's time and are just a circle jerk talking about what could be done.  The real work is done in the trenches.  I don't have any appreciation for people who schedule meetings to get things done.
So yes, I think Ver has done more in his time than Mow.  I don't think holding circle jerk conferences where there's no valuable outcome and being a joke on twitter even comes close.  Ver has, in my opinion, done a hell of a lot more actual tangible things *for Bitcoin* than Mow.


One yaps, the other built.  Things may have gone downhill for Ver in recent times, but I respect what he's done for BTC a lot more than anything Mow has done for Bitcoin, ever.
Edit:  I just want to be sure that I'm on the same page here, is your argument for why you think Mow has done more for Bitcoin because "He held meetings!"?  If so, that's pretty sad, not to mention weak.

It doesn't need to be an argument. It's a statement of your inability to comprehend the big picture.  If you're unable to comprehend it, then why should your opinion on the matter carry any significance?
Protip: It shouldn't.


No, it doesn't "depend" on how it grows.  1MB blocks or 10MB, the only thing that changes is the rate at which it grows - the time it will take to reach that increase in size.  
If Bitcoin is here to stay we will achieve that milestone regardless of whether it's with 1MB blocks or 10MB blocks.  Processing power *will* hit an upper bound if it hasn't already and the blocksize will keep growing regardless of that wall being hit.  Full nodes moving to datacenters is an inevitability given that Bitcoin remains in use. 
This isn't rocket science. You should be able to put 1 and 1 together here.

If you're starting your business with HW that was below average 5 years ago, sure.  Further, it takes longer than 24 hours to create a proper business, so I would just include this in part of your startup timeline.  Not to mention that most anyone who's starting a business that will accept BTC is likely going to use a payment processor.  In fact, doesn't Microsoft use Bitpay? Surely they have the technical know how to accept it directly.
But I digress,  perhaps a 2 month initial sync time on below average 5 year old HW actually translates to 24 hours on modern "PRO" HW?  I do not know.  If there's any data on the topic I'd be interested in seeing it.


Both options for consideration, I'm sure.  IMO fighting for full decentralization (lack of better term) of fully validating nodes is an honourable fight, but a losing battle.  A line needs to be drawn somewhere and, again IMO, that line is far from keeping Bitcoin full nodes in the hands of Africans who have scrounged together working PII's from the tech waste dumps. I honestly believe that a successful Bitcoin network will put full nodes out of reach of the average person, that it is inevitable and that people should be planning for/to handle that scenario instead burning brain power and time trying to prevent it.

Roger's getting a little weird, but I don't think this is *exactly* a case of misrepresentation and lying, probably more a case of Twitter's character limit and Roger's autism.
The way I interpret it is that the "25 year future" is a result of the policies currently held by G.Max.  As in, it all went to shit because we follow G. Max's broken interpretation of economics.
So, yes, Ver's presentation of the quote implies failures *now*, and the quote shows hypothetical failures in the *future*.  I think Ver's intention was to imply those *future* failures are because of the policies in effect *now*.

Miners may or may not set the block size to 16MB, likely they will keep it at 8MB or less because that's the maximum they feel that they can safely handle.  Further, even if a max blocksize was set to 16MB the blocks would not, all of a sudden, be 16MB. They would be large at first to relieve any backlog but then would only be as large as required to empty the transaction log which at present is much less than 16MB.  
Empty/overflow blocks has neved been an issue in the past, it is only now where blocks are just full where fees are drivin up and the community divides on how best to approach moving forward.
Also, mining is already centralized, 16MB would probably increase orphan ratesand it would be in all miners interest to prevent the possibility it happens.

Thanks for the welcome.  I'm a long time Reddit user but burned my last account.  I like to maintain a level of anonymity and after 5 years there were too many crumbs on my old account -- I've been here (Bitcoin) since 2011.


Thanks for your permission :)


I always like to give the benefit of the doubt.  I know Roger's position, looked at the tweet, read the excerpt and came to my conclusion.  Sometimes people let their biases get in the way and I'm attributing the title of this thread to be clouded by bias.

Source?  We know Bitfury isn't just in it to get rich.  We know Bitmain doesn't sell all their coins.
These miners also can't "move on" because very few coins use SHA-256 for PoW.
Maybe you're talking about all the small time home miners that have moved on?
Regardless, without them you don't have a network, period.

Like I said, I like to give benefit of the doubt.
I'm going to disagree that this is the first time that it's been so "blatantly public that people just can't ignore it or even reasonably defend it."  In fact, I don't think this meets that criteria at all which is why I said that people's biases are showing.
Anyways, we can just agree to disagree.  I see this example differently than OP.  Sometimes Roger is very much manipulative and twisty, but I don't think this fits that template. Sorry.

It is entirely possible that the Bitcoin Hearn knew is dead and/or dying.  If this is possible, then it's entirely possible that he was speaking to people who shared his beliefs, and to whom, Bitcoin would also be dead and/or dying.
Bitcoin today is not what Bitcoin was yesterday.  You've been around long enough to know that.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:15:50
So you'd rather have 1g of gold than 1oz?

I'll assume you're speaking in good faith as I'm not going to verify these claims myself.


And to claim otherwise is unfounded in fact.  I'd agree it *looks* that way, but that doesn't mean shit.
The thread title "Proof of Roger Ver being malicious, attacking Bitcoin devs, financing campaings with his money" is patently false given the Medium article.
Roger Ver may be doing all of those things, but the Medium article is not proof of it.  There are probably a lot of things our there that do prove the title, but they were not offered here, were they?

And it also dropped to $65USD after hitting that high and there was no guarantee it would return.   Further, the 5 people that bought a fraction of a coin at the 2013 ATH are still underwater assuming they've held this whole time.

Don't forget that part where coins are held as "anyone can spend" so the SF kludge works, creating a neat new attack surface where people can potentially lose their BTC, forever.

@_date: 2017-04-11 04:38:50


I can't believe I just read a string of posts where everyone has this belief.   Core *does not* decide what Bitcoin is.  All of us, the users and miners do.  All Core does is code things they think could benefit Bitcoin and present to *us* to run if we chose to.
If Core actually "decides what Bitcoin is" then we are in a very, very dark/bad place right now.
@_date: 2017-04-28 04:32:36
In essence, yes.  The early chips also benefitted from low/weak competition (efficiency didn't have to be top priority) and there was *massive* demand.  At the time you either held shares in ASICMINER,  were getting fucked over by BFL, Avalon, Bitfury, or one of the many, many scams.  
The market place was ripe to come in and offer a product that worked and you could deliver. And in that regard, Bitmain killed it.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:36:22
Other countries have developed ASICS.   Bitfury started out Russian.  Spondoolies was Israeli and lasted until they started a price war with Bitmain and lost.  KNC is/was Swedish.  There were also a bunch of other manufacturers  in the US that failed miserably....

Are you sure? My understanding is their HW works just fine with SW they just don't get the efficiency boost.  If so, yes they can launch a 51% attack assuming they have that much hashpower.

@_date: 2017-04-05 15:44:40
As a matter of fact I do, but what does that matter? You can tailor your allowable connections to suit your limitations.  I believe this is a really poor argument.  Centralization to some degree was always foreseen. The original client didnt have a hard block cap, cheaper faster connections are becoking the norm.  
Pretending like we need to make running a node viable for people who probably cant even afford to transact with Bitcoin is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-04-05 02:50:50

Since this is going to garner hate from the regular shitposters please know that I don't like Bitmain, and I sure as shit don't trust them (in fact I don't trust any if the incumbents of Bitcoin, *at all*), but not including asicboost if you can is a poor business decision.
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:29:33


In the context of your original question it is entirely a matter of perspective.  
*I* am a true believer of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is what *I* believe it to be.  Therefor whatever chain *I* chose to follow is the real Bitcoin.  
The only way that "logic" works is if it's *the other guy* that forked off, and not you.  *They're* the alt-coin, not *I*.


Nothing (IMO) but give greater motivation and confirm the bias of those I speak about above.  I suppose there's the argument that if the "majority" of nodes signal USAF, then that means miner's "have" to flag SW or "we won't buy their coins!!!one!!".
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:36:43
Honest question: would you be OK if all miners signaled for SW but only the 30% (?) that actively support it actually processed SW transactions?  The remaining 70% mining legacy style txs only?
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:06:29

@_date: 2017-04-05 00:01:08


Are you new here?
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:03:08
I would consider not using it less of a bad business decision than not including it.
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:53:49


Could a miner choose to signal SW so the USAF nodes accept their block, but refuse to include SW transactions?
You as the UASF node would accept their chain as valid, but they would not process SW tx's effectively making the whole thing useless.  
Of course, *some* percentage of miners would process the SW tx's, but that would only (at current) equate to a ~30% chance of being mined.  SW tx's would start to pile up and an independent fee market would develop for the SW transactions.
The only hope would be that the fees would be enough to entice a miner to include the SW txs, but if the miner is against SW for ideals/principal (or whatever) and the USAF have forced their hand, you can be sure there will be inclusion issues.

@_date: 2017-05-28 06:29:50
UASF isn't a split from hostile Miners.  It's splitting *yourself* away from the incumbent chain because you can't handle not getting what you want.
Miners are not selfish mining, double spending, 51% attacking, or any other "hostile" thing.  They are playing by the rules of the game that they have always played by.
UASF is a user driven 51% attack against a system, that *is not* a democracy, just because you want something others don't want.

@_date: 2017-05-29 04:24:24
Not sure on the ignorant part but miners can set their min fee and the can also set a blocksize soft limit.  Why, then, have they never abused these two configurable options that they have always had control over to grind out high fees?
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:47:54
I can't fault them.  If dumb wreckless shit, like BIP148, is the grounds we're playing on, then I fully expect them to play by the same rules.

@_date: 2017-05-26 14:46:46
Don't blame little 6% miner, blame Core.  *They* put that limit in there.  *They* failed to sell their scaling plan and gain consensus.
And now, some contributors to Core are promoting a 51% attack on Bitcoin via a UASF.  There is a lot of weird shit going on.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:41:27


Repeating this garbage is just lame.  Why do it? Does it make you feel like you're part of a club or something?


No one has been fucking anybody.  This, whether you like it or not, is the way Bitcoin was designed.  Consensus must be formed for changes to be made, and consensus has *clearly* not been formed.
Then people went back to the drawing board and some dim users decided it would be a good idea to try and force others into "falling into line", and now they are getting the same treatment.  In my 5+ years involved in/with Bitcoin I have never been so disgusted by the people involved.  Users, miners, developers... everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:22:23
What a joke.  Technical merit no good, only have personal attacks left?
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:46:28


It makes perfect sense.  People have been requesting a blocksize (not blockweigh) increase for *years*.  I agree that Core has worked hard on developing *a* method for safely increasing the blocksize, but clearly what they have chosen to work on is not what the market wants or SW would have been activated by now.  What *is* clear is that as far as mining majority is concerned, far less than half believe that SW is the path forward.  More so, more miners believe that no hard limit and EC is the path forward, and another third believe that neither of these options are the correct path forward.
Core has clearly failed to either a) sell their vision for scaling, or b) failed to provide what the market wants.  And, to be honest, that's okay.  Core doesn't have to do what the market wants, they only have to do what they want and what they believe to be in their best interest.  Much like I get to chose what software I want to run.
At the end of the day a vocal minority is trying to force their opinions and views on others and in turn the "economic majority", a term I despise, is going to attempt to force their views on others.
Core has had every opportunity to manage this in a fashion that moved us all forward, and they have, IMO, failed.  I am clearly not the only person that believes this since 70% of miners have not supported SW and the community is split.
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:27:26

Then move to Litecoin.  It is essentially the same as Bitcoin, but has SW.

@_date: 2017-05-29 14:34:13
I am sorry, which is visible in the chain?  Abusing min fees or the soft limit?
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:56:40
Blocksize increase must be done via hardfork and is by definition a chain split.  The original SW proposal tries to prevent a chan split by having a, retardedly unobtainable IMO, minimum level of hashpower support for activation.
UASF is a bunch of people who think Bitcoin is PoS and not PoW.  They are trying to "take the power back" which they could have done at any point in time by buying a miner and using it as their vote/voice.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:45:11

Perhaps the "good men" believe they *ARE* trying to do something with BU.  Perhaps you should also consider that 40 some odd percent of blocks being mined flag for BU is a sign that something is severely *broken* with the status quo.

@_date: 2017-05-29 05:10:54
Miners have always increased the block size to keep things manageable.  They are no longer able to do so.  Moving forward Miners have been pretty straight forward on what they are willing to accept, and Core has failed to provide a sufficient plan in their eyes.  So, now, Silbert's agreement is going to try and route around Core.
From what I can see: miners want to scale.  There is more money in larger blocks than there is in smaller blocks and miners are well aware of this.

Core as a whole isn't because this (UASF) needs to be a user's decision and should, in no way, be influenced by the incumbent dev team. 
However, I would bet that UASF proponents do owe a lot to certain Core players as I think they are "working" behind the scenes in a pretty heavy capacity.

@_date: 2017-05-31 01:50:40


How so?


It will literally make no difference unless new TX's are SW.  This is not a hard concept to follow.  Blockweight increases tx throughput *only* if a transaction is from SW to SW.  This does not help legacy TXs and it does not help onramping to SW.
There is no such issue with a standard blocksize increase. Period.  The SW block is only "literally more data" per block if SW to SW transactions are used, which won't help people like me because I won't be using it (SW).  That does not mean, however, that I am standing in the way of your choice to use SW.
There is a fundamental difference here that is almost always conveniently left out.

Of all those that have tried and failed the primary failure mode was taking pre-orders to fund development and manufacturing, then failing to meet deadlines and advertised specs.  Some never shipped or shipped HW that was defective or failed after a short period of mining.
Some didn't understand the marketplace and put value into things that didn't matter and at the end of the day and couldn't compete on a financials level because of it.
Others made a go of it but then turned to the dark side of self mining after paying for all their costs with end-user sales.  Oddly enough even those that did this didn't survive.

@_date: 2017-07-06 16:41:36
There is an optimal point where more transactions with smaller fees outweighs fewer transactions with high fees.
Not to mention the valid argument that full blocks at 2MB could potentially provide *double* the fees of a full block at 1MB.
I believe miners want to maximize fees *and* maximize space in a block, but not to the point where the network starts to degrade and users turn elsewhere.

Coin inflation continues to 2140, or something like that.  Further, rise in exchange value offsets the decrease in subsidy.

@_date: 2017-07-06 16:59:41
Why would anyone go through the effort, and for what gain?  The reason no one has done it is because it's dumb and doesn't gain you anything.
My scenario merely points out that "market share" or "market capitalization" is a misleading metric.   Case in point, Bitcoin's *actual* "market share" is larger than reported because a percentage, maybe even a significant one, of the coins used for the calculation are locked up or inaccessible.


How do you think the marketshare and market cap values are calculated?  Unit price * number of units.  If I am the only person in control of my hypothetical market then I am in complete control of its "value".
The same calculations used to derive Bitcoin's m-cap will show that my imaginary coin is worth 1 Trillion dollars. This obviously, as you point out, does not mean that I can extract 1 Trillion dollars of wealth out of my imaginary coin, *just* like you can't extract double digit billions out of Bitcoin if you held 50% of the issued coins.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:44:09

FYI that's a broken misleading metric.  I could create an altcoin with 1,000,000,000,000 units, get it listed and sell myself one unit for 1$ and all of a sudden I have the most valuable coin with the most "market share".

If nobody cared why did the UASF exist to enable SW?  Why was this subreddit filled with SW cheers when BIP91 looked like it was locking in?  It appears to me that makes more people care than "nobody".


 
What do you mean, why was it such a modest increase?  What's the point of creating larger witness space than already planned for if the space as is is unlikely to ever be filled with normal transactions.  Isn't it already common-think that the only way that 3MB worth of space will ever be filled is with complex multi-sig, or total use of future confidential TXs? If so there is no need to increase that part further, it's fundamentally useless.
There are more entities that have invested time and effort into SW than there are that have for a larger "blocksize".  In this vain I think it's totally appropriate to consider the parties behind ~~ramming it through being SW proponents.~~ the spam "attacks" and social engineering being SW proponents.
EDIT: Clarification.

@_date: 2017-05-31 00:52:28


It increases the size *only* if people use SW transactions.  I certainly won't be, but I am sure others will.  But, this does not change the fact that moving to blockweight does not increase transaction throughput for legacy style transactions.  It may be considered a "blocksize" increase, but larger blocks under blockweight is, IMO, a fundamentally different thing increasing max blocksize.


I agree. Clearly they feel that enough users *do* want it that it's important to include to achieve consensus even if *they* don't want it.


I like the idea of EC, but I agree that I don't think it's plausible.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:07:51
I agree.  However, it's worth recalling that Bitmain was one of, if not *the* last group to move towards EC.  They waited until they felt their obligation to the agreement had passed before choosing an alternate path forward.
As an aside, I think the whole ASICBoost upset is ridiculous.  If it works, and can be enabled by anyone who owns the requisite HW then that means that thousands of small independent miners can now mine at a profit instead of a loss.  In this aspect it is actually a boon to decentralization.  I guess it all depends on how you look at it.  Not to mention they aren't the only people that discovered it, and I would imaging they aren't the only people who put it on silicon.

Of course they are profit driven.  Profit motivation and greed is the entire premise that the PoW game theory is based on, is it not?  If you 're not okay with that, then you're using the wrong cryptocurrency.
This still doesn't change the fact that Bitmain has invited end-users to join the party whereas Bitfury, Bitmain's biggest competitor (?) only sells containers by the Petahash and you have to *apply* to be considered as a client.
I also believe the multi-millions they have invested into design, implementation, infrastructure, and HW says that they're more in it for the long-term than the short-term.  If Bitcoin goes tits-up all of that is *worthless*.  If they just sold HW and didn't self-mine then I'd be more inclined to agree with your statement regarding their alleged lack of long-term commitment.

The model for success is selling hardware that you can actually ship, and that the HW you're selling meets the specifications that you sold.  Those specifications have to be super efficient, and the cost can't be out of control.
That's all it takes, yet so many other groups failed.  It has nothing to do with mining with the HW first, as evidenced by at least one failed outfit: Butterfly Labs.

Why are we at 32mb blocks? Is this the technical limit?  If so, then accept that that is all that the network can *technically* handle.

Getting your jimmies rustled about variance and rounding errors. Awesome.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:39:50
You got it.
When talking about miner centralization it is worth keeping in mind that Bitmain sells HW to the public and they have since they started business.  Then go see what Bitfury has to offer and keep in mind that they only recently started selling chips to 3rd party manufacturers.  Also check which mining manufacturers have provided cheap hosting to their customers, and which have offered hashing contracts.
You will quickly find that Bitmain has worked very hard to get miners in the hands of end users.  They are literally supplying hw to their competition.
Bitmain and some Bitcoin users may not get along or see eye to eye, but make no mistake, they have not been an enemy to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:40:37
I was talking about bigger blocks = loss of the decentralized properties.
It's not just 1MB = decentralized and &gt;1MB = not decentralized.
Surely there is a tradeoff and if we could accurately define what decentralization is and build an appropriate model we could do the calculus and find the optimal point.
Perhaps I missed the point.
@_date: 2017-06-07 23:13:16
I concur.  Also notice that there's nothing in those words that indicate:
1) It's not for all transactions
2) It's only for large transactions
3) That it's expensive to use
4) That it's not designed to scale, as-is.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:42:44
I really hope that isn't a "pro" argument.  With all the rabble rabble about miner centralization, are you really counting one entity having &gt;75% of your chain's hash rate a positive?  
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:46:41
I'll tell you why: Pre-sales.
Almost *all* of them took pre-sale money to fund their operations and based those sales on unachievable timelines. Then, when they finally had HW, it didn't meet the specifications that they had sold.
Bitmain showed up out of nowhere and had a working, producible design and was ready to sell. Shipping HW within the week after purchase.
Google the Bitcointalk user "Sushi" from late 2013 to see where it all started for Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-06-02 05:03:31
I have a node.  Have had it up and running for over 5 years now.  I was also a fairly large miner until Bitmain started turning shitty.
I am more than willing to fire up my old hashpower to mine for SWSF/2MBHF when the time comes.
And it most certainly is artificially limited at this time.  It was deemed appropriate some *6 years ago*.  Tech has progressed.

China banned Bitcoin pretty much every 2-4 weeks for what seemeed like months in 2013/2014.  Mt. Gox blew up and that had a big effect but the PBoC anouncements most certainly fucked up the rally.

@_date: 2017-06-16 18:49:36


No you don't. You need to spend maybe 5 minutes doing the math, which I just did.
The scenario of 1% of the world's population opening and closing a channel *once* per month with an avg tx size of 0.529kB would require 16.75MB blocks *just for this one use case*.
Add in all the onchain txs that are likely to exist at that time and the blocks are looking pretty large indeed.
So how are all these people going to get in and out of LN when we can't even get passed the SW's 1.7MB-2.2MB?
Ain't fcking happening my man.
AND, since you are talking about Visa transactions. Visa processes about [12MM]( transactions a month.  The above scenario of 1% population opening and closing a channel a month is 140MM transactions a month. That's over *10x* VISA's transactional use.
TL;DR: You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:58:12
You so funny!  I suggest you guys start working on that before the exchanges decide for you, if theyre even willing to entertain listing the bip148 chain, which they probably won't because it won't be useable.

I repeat, these GPUs will **never** outcompete the Chinese monopolies and their ASICS, **ever**.


As far as I know (AMD at least) does not have their own foundary.  They use GlobalFoundaries for ASIC manufacturing and there really isn't anything from stopping Bitmain from having theirs made there too.
They only thing the GPU manufacturers have is big budgets and on-hand talent.
None of that changes my original statement.

You're missing the whole other part, genius. The part where without the miners the user's coins don't move and are worthless.  You don't get to decide the coinbase coins are no good but still have yours transported.  It's amazing that people still think this is a one-sided relationship.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:41:17
Indeed they do.   Bitcoin may never be able to serve 7+ billion people, and that's okay too.  However, saying someone's "coffee" purchase doesn't belong on the chain is also saying that Bitcoin is not for anyone that's in third world countries or developing worlds.  It's dangerous thinking. A lot of *current* users aren't the top 10% of the world, eventually they'll be priced out too.  Will that be okay?  How about when you can no longer afford or justify the cost of a TX, or you can't spend all your small change outputs because the cost to send is greater than their value.  Will it still be okay then?  How about if things get *so bad* that you need to be a bank or a huge corporation to make an onchain tx.  Will that be okay too?

Value proposition of Bitcoin was originally (at least in 2011/2012 when I became active) as a peer-to-peer trustless currency. It is now trending more towards being a store-of-value/digital gold.  That's its value proposition.
Ethereum is a "turing-complete" smart-contract system.  It wasn't/isn't (as far as I know) intended to be a currency or store-of-value.
The crypto-hole runs deep. If you're new and trying to learn/understand then I wish you a good journey.  I have been on it for 6 years and I still have *so much* to learn.
As a parting thought: Be very, *very*, critical about what you read and what you're told.  There are a lot of people trying to sell you something and won't be honest about it and/or their intentions.  Be skeptical, ask questions, come to your own conclusion and never be afraid to challenge your understanding/interpretation of something.

Neither does Bitmain, but they do.  OP is wishing for a competitor to Bitmain, all I am saying is BF is the best bet.  But they don't want to, because end-users are a complete headache, and why invite competition?

Miner greed is, IMO, the *basis* of the incentives that make Bitcoin work.  Not sure why you have a problem with that.
Did you know that people have been pushing for larger blocks since the limit was first put in place?  That people were against Satoshi putting in the limit in the first place because it would end up being a PITA to remove in the future?
