Litecoin is first runner up only because it was fastest runner up.. xcp has been at parity with Litecoin for days now and still rising. Smaller market cap, but it shouldn't be ignored based on the merits of what CP has been working on vs most (scam)altcoins. I don't see what litecoin offers other than a currently bigger market cap, whereas bitcoin 2.0 protocols are actually adding hordes of valuable new features..
So in regards to OPs question, xcp, because counterparty is pretty awesome and they think big. Also it has utility as you can easily create and distribute assets, bet, use decentralized exchange etc..

I'm new to hodling and I'm assuming this "hodling" crap is some type of hodling joke but it is extremely hodling and de-hodls this hodl. Even if some of you are hodling can you at least hodl to hodl hodl?

I just got my first bit a week and a bit ago. I'm just detached from the money entirely because I believe in the tech and want to see it flourish. I had the same worries at first but when I started to see what the future could hold for decentralized technology in general, I stopped caring about "losing money".
