They are against torrents and piracy. BTC works (kind of) in the same way in regards to P2P network. If it were up to hollywood, they would make all P2P networks ILLEGAL WITH JAIL SENTENCE =) . Psuedo-connection I know

I do not like your semantics. You clearly know what I mean. I apologize for doing many things at once

I became a BTC Millionaire yesterday. Today I lost that status. All the volatility made me come up with this idea:
It does not seem to be a 'hit', but whatever. I'm sure it is still a valid idea. If a hacker can DDOS to cause a crash and make huge amounts of money, then a group of redditers can do the same IMO
No big deal though, the idea of BTC is alive and well. The price will climb and I'll reach that status again. NP

Valid typo. I fixed it. Its not about how many BTC you are willing to put down, its about how many you are willing to create this thing.

That could work. Thats how one of the MT Gox DDos's worked I believe

Bitcoin is not the concept. It is an example of a concept. The concept is decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is just the biggest example. Theres coins popping up everywhere if you have not noticed

The idea of a decentralized cryptocurrency is alive and well. Do you really think a minor crash caused by reddit will "kill" the whole idea? If anything, it will bring media attention, helping the cause
