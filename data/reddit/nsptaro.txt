The beauty of the blockchain. Empowering people to take control of their financial destinies without asking for permission. 
Sounds like an ambitious plan. Delish.

The Dogecoin community has taught us a lesson today. Sponsorship. 
By crowding funding sponsorship, the community has put Dogecoin (and invariably cryptocurrencies) in a new public arena (one hell of an arena).
Whether you're a dogecoin person or not, it's extremely admirable, and as a community, I think we need to get behind more projects like this which increase crypto's visibility.
Josh Wise FTW :)
