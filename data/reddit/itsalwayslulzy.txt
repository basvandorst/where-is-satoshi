I got downvoted to hell posting this 10 minutes ago. This place is a goddamn echo chamber 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:24:44
Uh I don't think so:

This whole subreddit is fucking delusional. Case in point:


What the fuck are you even saying? If there was any regulation, you would still have your ~$275,000, and the executives of Mt. Gox might be going to jail. Unfortunately, neither of those things is going to happen.
Maybe if this board would have taken heed of all the warning signs like Mt. Gox's accounts getting seized 9 months ago, withdrawals slowing down, etc, you might have had the sense to pull some money out a while back. Unfortunately, every piece of news that could be interpreted negatively towards Bitcoin gets downvoted to hell. Sometimes, it's better to accept bad news than to live in an echo chamber.
I really feel sorry for you. Hopefully you, and others, have learned an important lesson today
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:45:47
Don't shoot the messenger, guys. Do you really think Mt. Gox is going to survive this?

Is it really necessary to be anti-Semitic here?

I would like to know as well please!

Just curious, what's wrong with Coinbase? I just set up an account there, and I was hoping to transfer funds from my Chase account into it within the next few days

I appreciate the update, and IMO, I think it is key for a startup like yours to have open lines of communication, especially when people's money is involved. As long as all pending transactions get completed, I think everyone will settle down and be happy in the end. But, as I'm sure you know, having delays when moving people's money around can be very unsettling.

No offense, but who gives a shit? This isn't related to Bitcoin anymore. This guy allegedly did some very illegal stuff online, if you try to turn this guy into some sort of folk hero you propagate the Bitcoin/crime underworld link the media loves.

Pretty cool, but I'm not gonna upvote because your title is pretty misleading. It sounds like its only for a particular phone for a particular promotion

This aspect definitely does need to be debated. Arguing that a currency with constant deflation is a good thing goes against mainstream economic thought and, in my mind, is the weakest aspect of the Bitcoin currency.

Now! It's dropped around 7% in the last 2 hours. I'm curious to see if it'll slide further or rebound

Overall, I do agree with your sentiments. I think that if Bitcoin continues without any BIG issues or security breakdowns, it will "catch on" and become fairly mainstream. However, my top 3 concerns right now are:
* Security in the long run (50 years from now, will it still be cryptographically secure?)
* The ability of the network to handle anything close to the worldwide number of cash and bank account transactions that happen every day
* The ease with which "average Joe" can securely use Bitcoin and pay for things on a daily basis

Just wanted to give an update on my situation. Just put in an order for 1 Bitcoin (lol, I know), and it actually went through. The order was executed around $62/BTC, and as we know, the price has risen above that. It says my Bitcoin should be delivered next week, but given that my order executed below the market price, I'm unsure if it ever will :-/
@_date: 2013-03-20 03:51:30
For fucks sakes man, get out now while you still can. Bitcoin has been on a tear upwards over the last few days, this is the perfect time to get out. Bitcoin has gone up 20% IN THE LAST 24 HOURS! As much as I believe in Bitcoin in the long run, this just screams bubble to me! Sell everything for cash, pay your cap gains taxes, and be happy your experiment worked out.

Gladly. If you're a "chartist," or someone who attempts to predict the value of an asset based on charts, this is one indicator that predicts an upcoming downward trend. It is generally believed to mean that buyers have tried to push the price higher, but have failed, so profit takers are moving in, at least as I understand it. [Investopedia article on that indicator here](

* Bitcoin is like e-mail, it's a protocol. But instead of being a protocol for delivering messages, it allows people to store and send currency electronically. 
* Just like e-mail does away with stamps, costly physical delivery, and pieces of paper... Bitcoin does away with transaction fees, central banking, and the physical manifestation of currency. 
* Instead of using printed pieces of paper to store value, Bitcoin uses military-grade encryption and a peer-to-peer online network. 
* And just like e-mail, Bitcoin is the beginning of an Internet revolution in commerce and how we interact.
I'm no PR guy, but does that sound good? Just trying to give you a few talking points people can relate with

There's a lot of butthurt going on in this thread, but I have a simple question for you:
What hash speed are you getting on middlecoin? I've got a GTX 580, and I'm only getting about 7khs. Using cgminer 3.5.0. I think something's not set up right on my end...
**EDIT**: Nevermind, I'm getting ~180Kh/s using CUDA Miner now. I'm going to stay out of this shitstorm debate and just give this thing a try for a day or two, see what happens.

To play devil's advocate, I think that there's no logical way to explain the rapid run-up in price over the last few days. There are some vague reasons people present, but I don't think they're sufficient giving the HUGE increase in value. If there's nothing behind a rise or drop in value, then it is mostly psychological. Also, I think lots of people who own Bitcoins are merely speculators.
Also, the dreaded triple top technical indicator has reared it's head - [here](
I'd love to hear arguments to the contrary, though.

Seems like a decent exchange, however, for Americans the only real way to transfer a decent sum of money is a wire transfer. Coinbase has an ACH transfer service which is free for most US banking customers. Wire transfers usually have a bank fee attached to them, so that scares me away from them.
But that issue aside, do you use Bitstamp? How do you like them?

Boom! Someone bitcointip me so I can spread the word pleeease! :)
