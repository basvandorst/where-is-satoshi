Looking for alt coins - everyone says really good things about binance - i might just go with that one  
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:45:33
Meh - I'm putting all my eggs in the basket  
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:55:25
So blocks = transactions, but do our funds (addresses) not live in the blockchain then?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:25:01
What reason would that be
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:16:25
Add btc to the same public key
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:52
thank you sir/maam
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:57:37
But couldnt we just have 1 block and keep adding Bitcoin to that. We would only need to remember 1 public key and 1 private key - that's all  
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:00:42
Wow - i didn't know that. So our addresses are not on the blockchain either then? They are all taken care of by this hashing algorithm?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:20
What about half and half? Buying half a coin this week and then the rest next week? Doesn't that give you a better chance?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:23:28
So miners will start collecting transaction fees or do you mean they won't have to pay fees for their transactions?:
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:36:58
Yes this is true but if we don't take loans for school then we're pretty much out of a degree - and without a degree you can't do much.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:31:54
You mean the size of the block or the chain overall?  
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:51:05
haha - thanks for the input dude (or dudette)
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:25:11
I don't think I saw it and I've been posting here for a while
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:45:40
Good point  
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:54:37
No need for name calling - just go to another thread if this one bothers you so much  
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:49:35
Thank you so much for this answer - I think we're gonna buy this week then cruise next week or so for some kind of dip if not then just buy from there and HOFDL
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:01:16
Me and my friend are scared to buy now at 17K - it was just 14k like yesterday - you think we should wait?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:07:54
Really? How? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:54:10
That's good advice - I just don't see my 401K growing much past what I already invested in it  
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:17:05
Wasn't this a big selling point for a lot of Bitcoin buyers? If this continues then expect the price to drop because people are not going to want to pay taxes on it  
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:02:20
When you say tax penalty are you referring to the self loan payback?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:49:29
Does the value change at all?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:13:26
Oh - so you took out a self loan? Sorry I'm a bit new to this. How did the high fee/penalty work for you?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:13:25
But wouldn't you say it's a step closer for the U.S. to regulate Bitcoin? They may not be acting to 'control' Bitcoin directly per se but they're maneuvering their way into investigating big investors who give Bitcoin a strong backbone give it such a high value  
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:40
Would the value be the same as when I first bought it or does it take present value when in ledgers?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:47:50
Good point! Thanks for the input - it might be good to diversify 
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:50:28
It displays about 30 different phrases depending on the price and fluctuation trends  
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:40:22
It's slang for ass in South America  
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:58:14
In Spanish "rabo" is slang for ass.

Oh I understand now - every transaction is made of 2 things (a public and private key). Public keys are where your money get sent to and they hold the 'balance' for that transaction. The private key is what allows you to 'dispense' the money out of that transaction file. Am I understanding this correctly?  
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:38:42
Where can I get a wallet to hold my bitcoins?  
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:40:53
Do you know how paper wallets are 'linked' to your funds? I see they just generate a code but never ask me for anything else - how does this work?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:07:12
I can see the public address being kind of like a bank account number, but is the private key a generated code that represents a certain number of bitcoins for that public address? I guess my confusion comes from trying out the offline paper wallet generators - how are do I link my bitcoin info to the offline generators?
