Ummm, how can anything be "official" when talking about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:37:00
The Bitcoin Foundation is not official.  They are a group of people that strive to better the protocol, but the miners still have to accept their updates.  So the Bitcoin Foundation could run a convention, but it would not be the official bitcoin convention.

Like killerstorm said, if you believe in bitcoin, buy it now.  I have too many friends that have said, "I'll buy when it drops back down some".  Guess what, they said that at $350.  It will probably never go back to that.  It's really tough to try and predict the market, especially if you are new to the game.

Essentially, your questions can't be answered quickly and easily.  As annoying as this response is going to be, I would advise researching a ton.    
It sounds like you may think the only way to get bitcoins is through mining, which is wrong.  There are a few different ways to get bitcoins, but the easiest way would be to buy them with fiat.    
If you think buying bitcoins with "real" money sounds ridiculous, it's apparent you have no idea what bitcoins are or how they work, and if that's true, I would advise not investing until you do.

Before I do, I'll state that I hardly know what I'm talking about and investing with bitcoin is kind of like stacking risk on top of risk.  So be ready to completely lose the value of your investment.  I can tell you what I have bought in, but you **really** have to read up for yourself.  I can't, and haven't read everything about these investments.  Also, I own shares in all of the companies I'm about to provide.    
*Buyer Beware*    
I'll put these in order of how safe I believe them to be:    
1. ASICminer    
2. bASIC-MINING    
3. Ciphermine (*Litecoin* mining group: risk on top of risk...on top of risk)    
4. ActiveMining    
I'll say again that this is all risky.  Some more than others, but all of them could get up and walk away(and some have), and the stock would plummet. It's not regulated at all.    
**Read up** and put in only what you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2013-07-24 13:29:32
If you really believe in bitcoin, then there is no reason to not just buy some coins.  It may not be as fun as mining or buying guns, but bitcoin's value should definitely go up over time.    
If you don't mind parting with that money, I would try and buy a few shares of many different companies on some of the exchanges.  Maybe like $100 worth of stocks and the rest on just bitcoins.  I have invested relatively small amounts(a total of around $300) and have doubled that within a month.  Just read as much info as you can find on an asset before you purchase.    
It's the Wild West right now, and there are a lot of ways to profit.

That is subjective and very hard to gauge.  Currently, if you want to get into the ASIC game, ASICminer Block Erupter USB sticks are the cheapest but some argue you may never get an ROI.  Some argue you will.  This game has a ton of speculation involved: value of BTC and the network difficulty.    
Essentially, you need to do a ton of research, and then be willing to gamble your money.  This game is not as easy as it may seem.

But you realize that banks and insurance are not special exclusive properties of other currencies, right?  Those are third-party entities.  The same will happen with bitcoin(I know NEO is trying to start one in Cyprus right now.) I can totally go give some dollars to someone and they can run away to never give it back. I guess that means everyone should stop using dollars.   
I won't deny that BTC getting scammed from people is bad, or that bitcoin has flaws.  But I will say that its flaws are mostly the result of human error, more than the currency itself.  I will say that bitcoin really has grown too fast, and there needs to be more time to figure this all out before it goes mainstream.

Bitcoin is already a huge risk, and I wouldn't even dare consider investing someone's retirement money into LTC.  Hindsight is always a bitch, and litecoin *could* rise in price, but that is such a gamble.  Seriously, don't touch any money that you, or your parents, aren't **completely** fine with losing.    
Because BTC is so volatile, there is a good chance that it could crash again to something like $30 or even $15.  Do you think your parents would be able to deal with something like that?  Most likely not, and they would want to sell before it got any lower.    
I think the best advice is to have them research it themselves.  And I mean a lot!  If they want to put serious money into it, they should be willing to put in some serious effort.  Professional fund managers *usually* have significant training in their field and still don't fair well.

I think the thing that is so incredibly shitty about them is how vague their delivery length is.    
It's obvious to us because we've heard all of the horror stories, but the unlucky bastard that happens to read the Wired or Ars Technica article will log his happy-ass on to their site and buy one.  Sure it says that it could take "2 months or more", but no one would think that could really mean over a year.    
Any reputable business would stop fucking selling.  Or make it EXPLICITLY clear that it could conceivably take a year and possibly not be worth it at that point.

Thanks for the heads-up.  I never saw this.    
You all do a fantastic job.  I was completely new to BTC about a month ago.  I downloaded every episode before I had to do a big drive for a family vacation.  By the end of that trip, I could sit down with other bitcoiners and keep up.

I can't stand Salvation Army.  Anti-gay, Christian charity.  Not neutral at all.

I think what you are doing is great.  It's businesses like yours that will help BTC become a big kid.  I think it's high-time I check out your website :)

Hey, I really appreciate your contribution to the podcast!  I have "turned" many friends to bitcoin by directing them to listen to the show.  I think you all are doing a fantastic job.    
To go in a slightly different direction, I was wondering if you could provide any insights into a post I made about an odd transaction I found on the blockchain:    
[    
While it seems that some people may have sort of an idea of what is going on, things like that worry me.  I am far from someone who understand the intricacies of the blockchain, but I find it troublesome that there may be things people are doing on there that the public doesn't understand.  Should we see transactions that don't make sense?    
Thanks for any help you can give!!!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't this most likely be a very short "control" of the network because people would quickly realize and fork?

You can buy PT(passthrough) shares on exchange sites like, [BTCT]( [BitFunder]( and [Havelock]( I will caution you to read up on any investment you buy from because these are passthrough shares and *may* have differences to a normal ASICminer "direct share."    
If you want to buy a direct share, you can do it on bitcointalk.org's [auctions page](  Make sure to be careful and read up on safe ways to go through the auction process to prevent getting scammed(use escrow, etc).    
PT shares usually just allows liquidity and therefore makes it easier to sell because a direct share is usually only sold at an auction and can take longer and be more of a pain to transact.
