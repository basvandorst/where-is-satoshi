You're too kind. I'd say it's more like C- skillz. ;)   Besides, I never get reddit love. They don't like muh memes on reddit, ever.

Good point. The documentary "The Culture High" covers this in detail. Well worth a watch.

I recommend using HSBCcoin for all illegal activity. HSBCcoin uses PoI or Proof of Immunity.

I'm all-in in the dark.

Wow, even getting tipped for ripping of muh image. Nice.

Props for getting 6x more upvotes than I did with my image. =b

Welp, a douchebag deserves a tampon a guess.

Here's some more images you can ripoff. By all means, take full credit (again)! ...

Oh well, it's hard to please an untalented fuck like yourself. I was trying to help support you by letting you rip off my work some more. So be it!

No it's not a real quote. I made the meme and this guy re-posted it later and is now collecting all the credit and tips.

it's all part of the mans plan to shut down small businesses.

lulz, no I'm satisfied with publicly calling you a douchebag.

looks like a series of shill accounts.
