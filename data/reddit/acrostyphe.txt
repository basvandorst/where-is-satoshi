You are very quick to part with almost $10k.

The value od Bitcoin doubles every 18 months.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:03:02
By using RES, by the way.

You get log2(6) bits per roll. It is most safe to just use digits 1-4 (2 bits per roll) and reroll if 5 or 6 are thrown. That way you get one hex digit (1 nibble = 4 bits) in 2 rolls.

There was the other people involved with you can get through the new year of this message and I am not sure whether you have a few months of the other than a bit of this.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:34:36
Really? I didn't notice anything different.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:09:49
Wrong. At least from a practical perspective. While you wait for your fiat to transfer, the price will change so much, you will be at loss.

They appear in the wallet of the client that miner is connected to (account "").

I don't think you're going to find many interested sellers. But seriously, try LocalBitcoins - I've had a very pleasant experience buying BTC locally.

You use it to test your Bitcoin interfaces/mining rigs/applications/... without spending actual money on it.

Here's a cookie.

While *I guess* it is understandable, this does not make it acceptable. After almost two weeks I asked them to cancel, I rebought the coins, transfered them to Bitstamp and issued a withrawal request there. It came through **the next working day!** 
I really don't see why they don't open accounts with more European banks if they have such problems.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:43:25
See above:

Sure not, but you cannot verify such a transaction If you don't have a relevant part of the blockchain. You have to trust the miners/full nodes. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:46:21
I wouldn't be so sure. I panic-sold yesterday on that minor drop before the up-surge. Now I'm glad I did, though.
@_date: 2013-06-16 20:03:45
Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:47:51
Well, it might work in theory, but you would have to act before the new block propagates through the network, because otherwise the transaction will not even be passed forth. This gives you a ~10 minute window for double-spending, which is not that much of a problem for low-value transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:12:03
Never jerk against the jerk.
@_date: 2013-06-15 14:07:03
Gee, that's one cheap coffee.

The 900 wall is quite high though. It might not happen that soon.

What do we do when we reach infinity?
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:32:44
I guess you're familiar with [this]( Absolute security is never possible but open-sourcing the software is a giant step in the right direction.
@_date: 2013-06-03 12:51:46
Listen, I never said I mined these coins just for bragging rights/karma. I am currently working on a software project and would like to experiment with various transaction types without draining the faucets dry. This is EXACTLY why we have testnet.
And when I don't need testcoins anymore, I'll happily donate them to faucets. Hell, I may even start one myself.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:10:17
I disagree. Personally I prefer social media notifications, because they are not dependent on their infrastructure (maybe they can't even access the customer database due to DoS, for example) and they can be done in a timely manner. I don't see why Twitter should be preferred (and they did publish an update there too, btw).
@_date: 2013-06-03 06:45:06
Of course not. It was a fun experiment and I had some spare credit I had no immediate use for. With 200 Mhash/s per instance and ~$2.5/hour for said instance, it is horribly ineffective.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:58:23
A couple of clarifications:
* As you can see, the order date is in **JUNE**, I contacted support three times, received no answer.
* The currently open ticket has not been responded to in more than a week.
* The site is full of bugs - this is the screen I see every time I go to the page.
* The Support tickets link conviniently dissapeared from the sidebar and appears only on certain screens, such as this one (another bug?)
* The first order I made with btcQuick went through smoothly.

That is 50 "BTC" on [testnet]( blockchain. I am running bitcoin-qt with `-testnet` on my computer and I followed [this tutorial]( to set up two Amazon EC2 GPU instances to mine.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:56:56
Well, I hope you sold immediately after posting this :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:00:53
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:58:28
Of course not. What I'm saying is that it is not likely that one would manage to double spend in such a short time without a dedicated effort which is not worth it for low value transactions. For higher value transactions, waiting for confirmations are a must, however.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:00:01
[here]( But yeah, I seem to have been wrong.
@_date: 2013-06-02 21:20:40
I assume, you meant the address - you don't. The client seems to automatically generate an new address from where bitcoins can eventually be spent (after they mature for 120 blocks).
@_date: 2013-05-25 09:28:42
BUY BUY!
@_date: 2013-06-16 20:34:30
That's because I never received any SMS confirmation code.
@_date: 2013-06-03 09:02:34
I disagree. When I tip someone, I want the money to go to them, not Reddit. If I wanted that, I would buy them Reddit gold in the first place (you can pain with bitcoin).
If simply buying Reddit gold with your tips is the easiest option, this defeats the purpose of spreading awareness.
@_date: 2013-06-03 12:12:04
At the time, the difficulty was 403, which is still kinda high for my CPU (I only push about 2 Mhash/s), and I was not willing to wait for days for a single block.
@_date: 2013-04-22 12:35:10
Reality sucks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:44:15
What are you talking about? For there to be a buy, someone has to sell.
