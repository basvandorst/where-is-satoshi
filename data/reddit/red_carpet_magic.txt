satoshi IS the quantum computer and the blockchain is just the beginning of its neural network. :)

True Story. Happened to me twice. :)

Funny thing was I was just trading for ETHUSD at around the time of the fork and their interface was lightning fast, almost instantly placing my Buy/sell orders... Can't fathom why they can't just invest a few more dollars to increase load capability, when their whole system of earning of thousands of dollars a day is dependent on this system.

BIG resistance and support at around 7k-7030. This whale is just too darn stubborn trying to force MACD levels of -20... and that's just unsustainable! they'll eventually run out of money so expect prices to bounce back soon! :)

what I meant was - existing coins should be fine once all the FUD anf FOMO are done.  
But startups may take a hit.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:38:53
even with this significant dip, the graph is still in a healthy upward trend. :)
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:45:44
sadly, FUD and FOMO are real..

everything's going down because of FUD, this does not make bitcoin illegal in China..  
ICO == Initial Coin Offerings  
ICO != BTC, ETH, LTC, heck even XRP
so stay calm and buy the dip. :)

A blocksize &gt;2MB is also easier for governments to control because in the case of China IP address Bans, controversial means to access the Internet like via dial up or highy encrypted vpn's, will take a longer time to send and receive data as compared to blocks &lt;=1MB in size.  
BCash and SW2x are just China trying to gain control of bitcoin and the crypto ban was it's way of throwing a tantrum because it didn't get what it wanted.  
BITCOIN IS UNSTOPPABLE!

bitcoin was overbought since Aug23. Day projections for the downtrend of the Aug18 peak all lead towards 3350-ish so I guess its time to shift gears from hodl to buy NOW. :)

My guess is that exchanges will not be completely shut down.. it just brings in too much taxable income to any country (like China) to just turn a blind eye on all that cash flow in the form of exchanges and miners.. much like how uber can't be banned despite ravings from taxi companies.. or China banning the iPhone and risk the closures of foxcom factories in their country..
but ICO's (and new coins) will definitely be regulated to oblivion. Like regular IPO's in the stock market, regulations and anti price manipulation protocols should be held in place to guarantee fair trade.

Though i'd love to discuss further about difficulty adjustments and miner zero growth from now until 2140, I'm not sure why everyone is so keen to point out about this last block and mining difficulties stuff... 
i'd just to clarify that my question is about if it is possible to verify transactions and collect fees without mining bitcoin or not.

Hi, great app mate! downloaded it and it is now my default app for checking market movements!
one small bug to report though, when adding my portfolio, I noticed i was not able to add prices with decimal values because the "dot" was not included in the keyboard options. I hope you can fix this so i can make your app my default portfolio management app as well! Also, it would be nice to have the option to be able to drag and droop graphs to sort it. Cheers!

My main concern is about regulating miner power over bitcoin. If we had the freature I'm proposing, and "verifying transactions without mining for bitcoin" was an option, then unhappy miners that stop mining would have a negligible effect in our bitcoin ecosystem.  
Without the need for a super hashrate, normal people with normal laptops, cellphones and even apple appliances with internent of things capabilities, would be able to verify transactions and earn fees.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:57:06
I understand that right now, this is not possible. But will some software feature update and algorithm upgrades split the blockchain in the future such that bitcoin mining and bitcoin verifications would be completely different tasks?

Technically,  yes. I think computation wise, the last bitcoin will even be astronomically impossible to mine. But a more realistic assumption is that difficulty would be very high by 2020-ish right..?

Many years from now, when the earth's population reaches 21 Billion, the moon will now become prime real estate that can only accomodate 21 million people. A trip to the moon can only be bought with 1 bitcoin. So yes, Bitcoin=Moon!
Kidding aside, you have very intersting predictions there.

I use Kraken, but be wary of placing orders using their (buggy) GUI interface, instead use their regular website to place orders.

This! but I think it will not even be a 90/10 split.. looking at other altcoun prices like ETH and LTC, you'll see that their prices instead of going up with bitcoin as the usual laws of the universe should imply, instead all of them went down in value. This may mean that the current price of BTC right now is over inflated because of people transfering funds from other alts into BTC in mad-mouth-bubbling-frenzy to not miss out on the BCash "craze" (that by the way has now lost over 85% of value since last I checked lol). I admit that I may have exagerated the 50% price split between BTC and BCC (especially now looking at the latest trends) but expect prices to fall back to what they were 2 days ago (2500-ish) or at the worst chain split FUD bringing the price lower to the previous 1800 support level (which was where I bought in wooot! and will buy in again 'hopefully' SegWooot2x).
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:23:52
SegWit2x is fast approaching! expect bitcoin prices to drop to 1500-1600-ish!  
why? if you zoom out 1 year, you'll see its all just auto-correction from the previous spike.. nothing to do with SegWit at all.. move along people nothing to see here.. just remember to buy at the lows! :)
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:23:49
Just checked the price of BCC and I lol'd when I saw it! biggest-bear-trap-EVER!  
But sadly i'm not in the same boat as you (I wish I was) on point3. 50% of my savings is now tied to altcoins, 40% in slower normal bonds/stocks and the remaining 10% I splurge on drugs, sex and money.. lol just kidding mate, I'm a nerd so I buy magic cards and D&amp;D! :D

I was watching closely during the whole event, the bot.. I mean the guy.. was bashing through 30-90 bitcoin walls like it was nothing!  
if someone bought some coins to move the price up, the bot.. I mean guy.. would fill out the gap immediately..  
place a buy limit order in between lowest Bid and highest buy? no problem, buy the damn thing! If someone placed a 7 bitcoin buy order, the bot/he'd counter it with a 7 bitcoin sell order..  
selling maybe close to 1k coins without lowering the price too much was done masterfully!  
it was one of the most tactical bear pushes I've seen in a while..!
(probably McAfee selling of at a high price point to buy in on post UAHF lulls to raise the price again exponentially.. doesn't want to eat his own d***)
