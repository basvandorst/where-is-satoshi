If Trump actually cheated on his taxes, with the amount of scrutiny he gets, the IRS would have come down on him ages ago. The only thing he's guilty of is being rich enough to hire people to find all the loop holes available that save him money. 
So unless you voluntarily pay more money to the IRS than you have to, it's a silly thing to be mad about. Be mad that the loop holes exist, not that people use them.

Top left looks like its giving me the finger.
Top right is pretty solid, though wouldn't now it's a fork without knowing the name, but that's not too big a deal.
Bottom one has no rhyme or reason to it. I'd have no idea what its about without the name next to it. And it looks like it could be a lot of other things.

It's not conservatives that are trying to take away peoples guns and restrict what is acceptable speech online and off.
Conservatives just don't want people shitting in the streets and promoting extreme hedonism to their children at the cost of a stable society.

Note that it might be in a hidden Windows app data / roaming folder.
ie. C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData
So make sure you have hidden folders visible before searching.

No you see Obama set in motion a series of policy changes that just happened to kick into overdrive as soon as he left office.

Japanese anime Evangelion. Quite a famous one, the character is Asuka Langely Soryu and is a cropped screenshot with the hand photoshopped in to be similar to a pepe meme of the same pose.

Bitcoin so far has been a series of ups then downs where the downs are less then the ups so overall it has gone up.
People are thinking that the recent uptake is indication of another high jump (higher then the previous high) that will presumably result in another crash, only it will not crash below 10,000.
While this could be the case, it isn't necessarily the case, but people like to be positive.

Yeah because nothing bad happens in non white countries. 
It's not like there aren't rich Chinese businessmen getting rich off of slave wage labour.
It's not like there aren't slave markets in Libya.
The Nanking Massacre totally never happened.
Only white men do bad things.
