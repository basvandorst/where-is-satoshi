Have you thought about setting up an ico where the profits go to charities via grants? call it something like Hope Coin

Funnily enough I contacted the charity I put forward and I think they miss understood the post on the website as they though short listed applicants would be announced before January. I have corrected them on this, I hope that was OK The charity is called Breathe for Cameron and they provide schools with emergency inhalers, spacers and training to help support asthmatic children. They encourage them to take part in sports and take control of their condition not letting it control them and inspiring them to be the best they possibly can be while having the life saving equipment they need. I have following them since they set up in 2015 after they lost their son to an asthma attack while he was a football training. Brilliant little charity that could use the support take a look  or

Agreed however if you was open and allowed the ico to be regulated do you think that it might work? This is a discussion I had with someone and they only way it would work was for it to be completely transparent

Hi I passed your information onto a small charity in the UK called Breathe for Cameron. I'm not sure if they managed to put the application in on time but they are worth looking into. They are doing some really good work and they are very small in comparison to some. I suffer with asthma and follow this charity I love what they are doing in schools to support children
