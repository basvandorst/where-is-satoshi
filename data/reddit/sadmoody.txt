Or we'll be telling our kids about how John McAfee ate his own dick.

I don't mind less serious posts. But this is literally a coke bottle with a popular japanese name on it. That's like someone posting a coke bottle with Dan or George on it in @_date: 2014-08-27 05:33:38
The "AS" in ASIC stands for Application-Specific. They're the complete opposite of a General Computer (i.e. phone, or PC). FPGAs are reprogrammable and can be reused for other purposes but they're not as efficient.

This is actually a good thing for bitcoin.

It's profitable to mine only because the ease of mining responds to how much power is going into mining at any one time. If bitcoin is worth almost nothing, very few people will bother mining it. Mining it will be easier, therefore it will still be profitable.
I wasn't assuming that it has ended. But saying that you will have $6.7m by investing $10 a week every year for the last 9 years neglects to mention that $6m of that is from only the bitcoins you bought during that first year, and almost all the rest is from the second year. 80% of the $10 you put in with DCA, in this case, don't matter much at all to the bottom line. It's more about getting in early than buying regularly. That's all I was trying to say. Whether or not it is still "early" is anyone's guess - but that's not what I was talking about.

Which is fine. The returns you've made are orders of magnitude less than the returns promised by this post, though.
The trend is up, I agree. But this post sensationalises it. That's all.

The majority of your bitcoins you would have acquired in the first year. It's not about the $10 a week, it's about knowing about Bitcoin 9 years ago...
This is far too simple/sensational of a view.

DCA is a way of managing price fluctuations - I completely agree with you. This post, however, says that BECAUSE of DCA, you could have made almost $7m over the last 9 years, where the profit wasn't really due to DCA, but due to starting at the point that you did.
I wasn't making a comment at all about whether or not it was still "early" for Bitcoin.

It's Megametres (1000 kilometres). If the moon was 345 kilometres away from Earth's surface - we'd have a lot to worry about...
