I had most of my funds in USD, and had even shorted BTC at the time of the hack. Which was obviously a good idea :) Yet I'm not sure if or how the hack could affect my account (bar bankruptcy of course).
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:26:58
I assume there is a number of trolls here trying to harm either Bitcoin (the usual trolls) or Bitfinex (trolls of competition, lawyers). I am considering to actually fill in such an FBI complaint, just to explain to the FBI that the other complaints are probably made to harm my interests...
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:03:26
I expec and hope that only accounts that had BTC in their BFX wallet will be affected by this. always a bad idea to keep btc in an online wallet at an exchange, so why let other customers bleed for it?
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:19:08
Sounds like a destructive idea to drive them into a real bankruptcy now. Better get that understandable aggression out of your system with some extreme sports or so...
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:52:41
What if I only had USD, why would I have to bleed for BTC hacks?
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:26:02
Looks like we really don't agree...
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:04:39
Even worse: "U.S. residents will only be able to sell—not buy—BFX tokens at this time." Guess what that will do to the value of BFX tokens... It's really crazy to allow trading them.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:09:02
Not just lucky. You shouldn't keep you BTC in an exchange wallet. With USD, I assumed the risk would be less, because withdrawal hacks are more difficult. Now if they even give the USD holders a haircut, it would mean that you should never leave anything on an exchange anymore... Let's hope they come up with something that most customers can live with...
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:03:18
Well, if you want your BFX tokens to stay completely worthless, and possibly lose even more than that, try and send them to jail. I can understand that people feel that way, but it wouldn't be a constructive solution to anything.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:59:00
I didn't say anything about not being worried :) But there's not much I can do right now, and keeping calm until be know more seems the most reasonable thing to do right now...
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:48:44
wow, and you made a new reddit name just to say that? your proposal sounds fair to me. I know, I didn't have any BTC in my BFX wallet (and that was not by coincidence), so I would say that, but if the hack had been for ETC, I doubt that all the BTC owners would have felt obliged to share the losses...
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:41:07
I think the Mtgox comparison is not fair. That was an amateur little company that grew too big too fast, and the size of the hack was 10 times larger. No matter what BFX does, they will get a sh1tstorm from some people, but the worst thing that can happen is if they put things online again, and then have to make changes again - then the storm would be devastating. So I'll cut them some slack for getting it 'right-ish' in one go.
@_date: 2016-08-08 06:00:27
Which is what I have been suspecting for years. Imagine if you exactly know where all the hidden limit orders and stop orders are set. What you can do with that information. I assume an exchange can skim a percentage that way for years on end without anybody even noticing it, or at least nobody can prove it. It's basically the problem of the exchange also being its own biggest broker. It works that way for all BTC exchanges. 
The current hack scenario is way too complicated to be a scam. If it were, I assume they would already by in Panama now, sitting on a lot of money/BTC.
I am happy with the way Bitfinex is handling it so far, except that I only had USD in my account, and I still have to pay for the people who had BTC stolen from their online wallets. But that's water under the bridge.
Let's hope those BFX tokens will actually be worth something in a year. I hope they don't make them free tradable, then I would start to feel like a Bad Bank :)
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:13:13
well, this is not a 1-1 love relationship. just have to make the best of where we are now. killing Bitfinex will make it worse for all, except for the lawyers.
@_date: 2016-08-11 07:21:18
The scandal is that we all had no knowledge at all and had tokens in our account that were freely tradable. We ended up being the Bad Bank here.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:31:57
1. I assume BFX is looking for new capital behind the scenes, and until that is done, it's very difficult to decide how to cut the losses, so that would explain the silence of the past couple of days. Zane started out great, but has become more silent. They are in a bad situation for investment or M&amp;A talks right now, yet I assume that's what they must be doing. Either that, or they were not even able to fix the hole yet.
2. I assume this must be an inside-ish hack. If you need 3 keys, anyone who already knows at least one has a big hacker advantage. Could also be someone at Bitgo of course.
3. Socialised losses sound good, but only proportionally on customers who actually held BTC. I had even shorted some BTC against my USD deposits, so it would feel very unfair to have to share BTC losses...
Anyway, I hope we finally get clarity today.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:47:47
First allow trading them, and then informing people what they are exactly?! Crazy. I feel like Bitfinex's bad bank now. OK, we already were that, but at least it looked like Bitfinex tried to rescue its reputation by buying them back for $1 one day. This way they are just giving the losses to the customers, at least the biggest part of it. I see no reason now for Bitfinex to ever pay $1 for them, and thus no reason for holders to hold on to them. Disappointing if they really allow trading BFX.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:22:27
Big difference, yet everybody seems to love to get the headlines wrong, naming Goldman Sachs in one sentence with Bitcoin or 'The Blockchain'. Still, better than no news at all :)

What will this mean for Braintree and Bitcoin integration? I remember the Ebay CEO talking about plans to integrate Bitcoin. A month later, some executive from Ebay daughter Paypal siad that it would take Paypal years to integrate Bitcoin. Yet another month later, it appears that Paypal daughter Braintree is planning to integrate Bitcoin soon. So without Ebay at the top of the hierarchy, will Braintree still go ahead with this? I certainly hope so...
@_date: 2014-10-06 09:11:03
Is it possible that Bitstamp itself ate the whale? I would have if I'd been them...
The last 10,000 were sold so fast today it looked suspicious.

I think such a service would violate the KYC/AML rules, so it probably wouldn't survive too long.
@_date: 2014-08-23 08:43:40
I've had a similar experience. Teaches you to start the auction price at the minimum you're willing to do the packaging and shipping for. Not Ebay's fault really. Indeed the guy who bought them must have loved Ebay at that moment...
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:27:33
True, but that's a small part of the market cap. Also, that infrastructure could easily be used for some next altcoin should we ever decide that bitcoin in not good enough anymore. Not that I hope that would happen...

For such non profits, it's probably more useful if a volunteer programmer offers them to integrate Bitcoin payments, as their biggest bottleneck is probably manpower. Come to think of it, I could imagine Bitpay and Coinbase employing 1 or 2 people just to make sure all charities start accepting Bitcoin with their help.

problem is you often don't know if news is really big until a week later. at least, a lot of headlines i think are big have no immediate effect on price, and sometimes the price makes a big move and it takes me a day or 2 to find out what the catalyst was. anyway, I think your best bet is to use IFTTT and use a RSS feed as input, and an sms as output. trick is to find the best RSS feed for your needs...

Would be great if someone could explain why it will probably stop at $200 or $150 or $40 or anything...

Lot of truth in there, but for Joe the plumber it's still easier to trust big institutions and governments than math, protocols and computer networks. Main thing his wealth is somehow protected. If the bank fails, at least the government will try to get him back some of his money. With Bitcoin, he still has to trust his exchange, his computer, his wallet, and last but not least, Bitcoin itself. Few people, and Joe is not one of them, think they can predict that Bitcoin will never fail or be hacked...
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:23:43
Thanks. That may all be correct, but for the average Joe, a newly available block has been created. Similarly we don't know how much new USD has already been printed and minted and waiting in a safe to be released, but I think we consider it created once it hits the market. Oh well, created or become spendable, mostly wording details I guess ;)

Our languages are pretty fine? I think the main reason Esperanto failed is because you can't learn it in everyday life, it has no culture, that sort of thing. But have a look at the following lines and tell me again that Enlish is pretty fine :)
ENGLISH IS TOUGH STUFF
Dearest creature in creation,
Study English pronunciation.
I will teach you in my verse
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
I will keep you, Suzy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy.
Tear in eye, your dress will tear.
So shall I! Oh hear my prayer.
Just compare heart, beard, and heard,
Dies and diet, lord and word,
Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
(Mind the latter, how it's written.)
Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as plaque and ague.
But be careful how you speak:
Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
Cloven, oven, how and low,
Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,
Exiles, similes, and reviles;
Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
Solar, mica, war and far;
One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel;
Gertrude, German, wind and mind,
Scene, Melpomene, mankind.
Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
Blood and flood are not like food,
Nor is mould like should and would.
Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
Toward, to forward, to reward.
And your pronunciation's OK
When you correctly say croquet,
Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
Friend and fiend, alive and live.
Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
And enamour rhyme with hammer.
River, rival, tomb, bomb, comb,
Doll and roll and some and home.
Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.
Souls but foul, haunt but aunt,
Font, front, wont, want, grand, and grant,
Shoes, goes, does. Now first say finger,
And then singer, ginger, linger,
Real, zeal, mauve, gauze, gouge and gauge,
Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.
Query does not rhyme with very,
Nor does fury sound like bury.
Dost, lost, post and doth, cloth, loth.
Job, nob, bosom, transom, oath.
Though the differences seem little,
We say actual but victual.
Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
Dull, bull, and George ate late.
Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,
Science, conscience, scientific.
Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
Rachel, ache, moustache, eleven.
We say hallowed, but allowed,
People, leopard, towed, but vowed.
Mark the differences, moreover,
Between mover, cover, clover;
Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
Chalice, but police and lice;
Camel, constable, unstable,
Principle, disciple, label.
Petal, panel, and canal,
Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.
Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
Senator, spectator, mayor.
Tour, but our and succour, four.
Gas, alas, and Arkansas.
Sea, idea, Korea, area,
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean.
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.
Compare alien with Italian,
Dandelion and battalion.
Sally with ally, yea, ye,
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
Heron, granary, canary.
Crevice and device and aerie.
Face, but preface, not efface.
Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
Ear, but earn and wear and tear
Do not rhyme with here but ere.
Seven is right, but so is even,
Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.
Pronunciation -- think of Psyche!
Is a paling stout and spikey?
Won't it make you lose your wits,
Writing groats and saying grits?
It's a dark abyss or tunnel:
Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
Islington and Isle of Wight,
Housewife, verdict and indict.
Finally, which rhymes with enough --
Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
Hiccough has the sound of cup.
My advice is to give up!!!

To look at stocks 24/7, you could also look at the e-mini S&amp;P 500 I think. I'm not a market expert, but I did trade the SPY (S&amp;P 500) index in the past, and understood that the e-minis are a similar index, but are being traded 24/7.

Can't help but think the strong price action today is related to this. Whatever comes out, I assume the rally will continue this week, as anything is better than uncertainty. Personally, I think the Bitlicense issue is very overrated. It's only one small state in the small US of A. An important state, granted, but the Bitcoin world is so much larger... If the current financial center of the US doesn't want to play along with the future, so let California become the new financial center...

What stops them from showing an advertised article price based on a BTC-E conversion, and then actually sell the BTCs at Bitstamp? That's another 1 or 2% gained. I'm hoping that more true believers will actually hang on to their BTC...

Great initiative. Funny though that the recipients don't look too happy or excited. Maybe it takes a cliffhanger or so, or some sort of promise that makes them feel really good about having received their first ever mBTC.

Remember to compare it to cash, not banking. If I give someone cash, it's gone unless that person decides to give it back to me. So chargebacks are still possible if spender and recipient agree to reverse the transaction...
@_date: 2014-11-16 08:04:38
They are lacing vague 'facts' with negative words, a classic strategy in pathetic arguing. Not very convincing when you're used to looking at hard facts.
-According to some traders (such as?) - 'hot money' parked in bitcoins to move outside (bad boys)
-difficult-to-trace nature of transactions (bad boys) have also helped bitcoins (helped how? To get bad press?)
-appear to be fading (appear to whom? price down compared to last year means fading? compare it to two years ago, or to last month and you'll get a different picture)

1. You're comparing miners to Visa, where you should be comparing them to gold digger or minters. OK, they also contribute to validating transactions, but that's not their goal. If you want to compare companies to Visa or Paypal, take Coinbase or Bitpay.
2. Your theory here is true for miners. As a miner I also decided to sell my hardware and buy BTC instead. But there's a lot more infrastructure being built than just mining rigs, and a lot of those companies make money by offering services very different to mining.

Hard to say which price is fair and which isn't though... $1100 only seems unfair now because it came down. If it had doubled, $1100 would have been fair.

That would be worth getting Willy and Markus out of the drawer for. It's interesting that Bitstamp currently has the lowest prices of the major exchanges (normally BTC-e is lower), so it could be that it's leading the way this time, and the rest follow through arbitrage etc.

@_date: 2017-02-23 06:06:55


which one? they can't be worth less both. BTC is worth less on that site it seems. so either it's more difficult/expensive to get BTC off the exchange, or USD on. Getting USD or EUR on there is not something you'd do with great confidence, as you'd have to transfer it to a bank account of the Bank of Mongolia. BTC withdrawal fees are not that high though, but maybe the process is tedious - haven't tried.
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:22:56
I don't think so. I'd like to see exactly whom I sold my Bitcoins to (or at least which BTC address), when, and which fees an exchange took for that.
@_date: 2015-01-11 08:43:54
Well the difference is 37.5%, and in 5 years, it could make a big difference whether you have a value of $1 million or $1.375 million. Percentage amounts multiply when the price goes up. The only scenario (heaven forbid) in which it won't make any difference in 5 years from now is if the price goes to zero :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:29:32
That's what I meant, it just doesn't make sense...
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:48:14
Then they did something wrong (I mean from their perspective - they are all wrong anyway of course). Inserting loads of tiny transactions to cause this trouble could be an effective way to make money shorting Bitcoin. But of course it can bring down the price only so much, so I assume they are just counting their gains now and may be back for another attack soon.

@_date: 2017-03-18 11:30:24
Thanks all. I don't actually use the wallet or cards. I just wanted to know if my n BTC in their vault will be n BTC + n BTU after a split, as in the contingency plan by the other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:08:27


I'm not a technical expert, but this is the first time I hear that LN doesn't need segwit. Are you absolutely sure about that? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:29:06
Did Xapo take an official position on this? I can't find it anywhere...
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:18:15
I don't know. If it sounds too good to be true...
From that post:
"Nobody knows what really its going on, but if we look at the data, Surbitcoin its not doing well. their hot and cold wallets are geting low every day, and the volume its so low.
In Venezuela we are using Localbitcoins, and on Bitinka and trading P2P with friends on the Bitcoin Comunity"
Thoughts anyone?
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:32:20
well, it's a roller coaster. also down 30% within minutes, and then up again. it's going bananas...
@_date: 2016-06-17 21:56:54
thanks for trying, but your answer raises even more questions :) ELI5 anyone?
@_date: 2017-01-04 11:01:52
Indeed, that's not hard at all. Even $1 million per BTC is not that far fetched, although it probably won't happen this year or next.
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:34:31
Popper knows a lot about Bitcoin (just read his book Digital Gold), but he's not a hyper. I found this article OK to read - not too negative. Agreed, things like 'more sophisticated investors' are a bit vague, but overall I think it's as balanced as I would expect from popper. There is a lot of speculation in the price, and there always will be with a free floating currency. 
PS I'm a HODLer myself. One way ticket to the moon please :)
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:48:16
It's interesting that since Jan 15, OKcoin and Huobi have significantly lower trading volumes than before. I've always suspected that these two exchanges were doing dark things, as their volume often seemed anticyclic. In contrast, BTCchina always had a more 'natural' volume. I am very curious what those dark prctices of OKcoin and Huobi were exactly... Hope we'll find out soon.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:27:49
Probably correct, but I doubt if the Chinese care about that...
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:06:31
So long and thanks for the $100 :) See you soon on the moon...

With BTC at this level, you can finally afford a new keyboard! This one looks a bit dated, and it's not being treated too well either...

Where does that Market Cap of silver come from? I don't believe it. I just read an article that the yearly production of silver is worth roughly $30B... Would be great for Bitcoin if this were true, but I can hardly believe it.
@_date: 2016-12-31 07:20:31
Interesting, but there must be something wrong in those graphs. We had a more than 100% price increase during this year, yet the ratio graphs stay close to zero during that time. I am more than willing to believe we're not in a bubble, but these graphs confuse me more than they help. Maybe I am misinterpreting the Ratio graphs?
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:49:50
Thanks. Very useful. It would be great to if you could add something about what a channel actually is and does, and how it works.

I watched the video, which says it's so easy, blablabla, but it still looks like abracadabra to me. Still way too complicated for most people.

No big deal I’d think. It reads “they will not be applying for licenses to operate in New York”. No exodus, just not going to NY. I don’t really care if my European exchange goes to NY or not. I think we should not overrate this.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:01:34
So? NY is not that big, and I'm sure the serious investors also have offices elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:40:54
Polo only does USDT, which itself is currently discounted some 10% against USD (traded on Kraken), so BTCUSD price is high on Polo as well.

Malapropos megalomaniacal.
PS sounds pretty cool imho - like a phrase invented to describe Roger :)
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:06:29
any price in satoshi currently sounds like hyper-inflation. not that good for our reputation, and not really much easier either. something close to a USD would be easier to relate to, so currently I would prefer a symbol for millies - we can still switch to bits later on if needed (I hope so...)

The problem is, I'm sure he is convinced that he does care about all that, and that he's doing his best for the world and for Bitcoin. But he is so convinced of himself, that he just assumes the rest of the community must be wrong. A true narcissist.
I wonder what kind of anarchist or libertarian he is. The anarchy he would live in would go under in civil wars. The guy must hate consensus, especially with people who don't agree with him...

I registered with Braintree last year for that reason, and for all I know it was already fully implemented back then. Looks like nothing more than news recycling.
@_date: 2015-04-10 14:11:37
It's very true what you say, and it's annoying to see this being sold as news.

ah wait, at least we're talking hardware - I was thinking EC2 at first. 
but still, interesting that the market thinks mining pays. i stopped mining more than a year ago...

right, but until p2p trading goes mainstream, i'd rather have independent brokers than exchanges that can suck the life out of their customers at their own discretion.
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:15:10
Well the problem is 'negative interest rates'. Nobody wants to have large reserves in USD, yet that is exactly what Tether is guaranteeing. I see their business model, and it's a great service, but the reserve guarantee is something I do not understand.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:10:04
I assume they meant it will be a catalyst for the exchange rate, which I also think it will.

Did you actually do a comparison with Xapo etc before ordering it? It does all sound a bit expensive. Especially now that I'm used to my  account, which is an Iban bank account, plus a credit card (which only works prepaid, but otherwise it behaves as a real credit card), and everything is free, even ATM withdrawals. Alas, they don't take BTC deposits, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did soon. I wish the Bitcoin industry would create this sort of (almost) free services...
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:17:40
It's a great way to move fiat between exchanges, to speed up arbitrage.
