Same for me, from commbank
@_date: 2014-06-12 09:15:11
Yeah- after 3 or 4 transfers now it seems to take two days for me transferring from commbank. I guess that it's one day to bill buddy (assuming you transfer before 4pm) and then another day to coinjar. It would be great if they could somehow cut it to one day. I miss over the counter deposits where it would appear an hour or so later.

Well, really the point is that it enables consumers to spend in Bitcoin who would otherwise not want to engage with the wallet process. The point isn't an investment vehicle, therefore it's more likely that a consumer deposits the money in order to spend in bitcoin rather than ultimately withdraw fiat. And regarding fractional exchanges- the concept works on the premise that the price of bitcoin ultimately stays constant or rises. They must have sufficient capital in place (likely a large reserve of bitcoins prior to launch) in case of a price drop. I don't know what happens if it drops to $1 or something as they almost certainly wouldn't have reserves- however in that instance, even if you held the BTC you would be screwed.

Aside from real world uses alts will still be relevant in at least the mid term as trading pairs. Such as what happened in the last big BTC rise, once the BTC price rises people will look to diversify investment and search for greater returns once the BTC price hits the top of its price cycle again. That's just a natural inclination- and yes, traders manipulate just as in any other market. At present many people are making back into BTC (lots of these reddit threads and comments seem to back this up), and rightly so- there were way too many people a month or two ago talking about portfolios with no BTC at all, which is an incredible risk in an already risky marketplace! (Crypto traders are the only people I know unhappy with a 20% return!)
However, I do think that it's prudent to have at least a portion of your portfolio in selected alts- for me this has always sat at around 30%-35% but that may even be too high for a lot of people as a risk profile. Ultimately a good time to invest in when sentiment is against a stock or coin. I've been long LTC for a very long time now- bought when the price was extremely low and I'll continue to hold long term. So as well as adding some more BTC over coming months I will probably add to my LTC portfolio, because looking ahead from here, if BTC hits $2500 which seems to be a common predication, I would be shocked if LTC was not at $50 (which is 0.02BTC) and I think that's conservative. You could probably say the same about DRK.
The point is, BTC has the network effect in place and I genuinely believe that's the place to be long term. However the argument should not be either/or- the reality is that the larger alts aren't going to completely disappear anytime soon- they will continue to have an important function in trading.

Ok- just to give me own experience in a recent transfer via BTC. I wanted to transfer $900 Australian to a New Zealand account- I usually use a currency exchange service which has a flat fee of $12 AUD each transaction (which is better than the banks wire fees etc). The exchange spread is good but not perfect- probably between 1-2% which again is better than the banks. Basically if I did the transfer as per usual I would receive $945 NZD at the other end.
So instead I bought ฿1.4159 via CoinJar (Australian service like Coinbase) for the $900 AUD. I transferred this to BitNZ and an hour after the process began I sold at a rate between $680-$690 NZD per BTC. The fees on BitNZ's end are 0.5% per trade, and there is no withdrawal fee. Ultimately, I now have $965 in New Zealand currency ready to be transferred to my bank- ie up $20 on what I usually would have paid and even a few dollars up on the 'best case' exchange rate considering arbitrage.
Go BTC!

It's a bit of stretch to call PETA Mt Gox- what have they done that is fraudulent to investors exactly? And if you are making a claim that they are fraudulent at least back it up with something concrete. They've been transparent on communications with investors and they've been transparent with the current situation- so why not let them come to a solution rather than make sensationalist threats on reddit with the sale of your shares?

@_date: 2014-04-19 15:03:35
Sure, but what other commodity can you perform this kind of transfer so easily and quickly with? Isn't it essentially a fiat arbitrage that my bank is profiting on when they perform a fiat exchange on my behalf? Low liquidity helps me gain some small percentage in arbitrage via a btc exchange, but I'd be happy with a high liquidity situation too- because the fees are almost non existent when compared to my banking fees and I am in control of the rate of exchange.

It's pretty crazy- it's not like these coins will even come onto the exchanges- unless I'm missing something they'll be big investors or funds and will just go into cold wallets. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:16:33
I can only speak from my own experience- I've probably made about 20 deposits over the last 6 months to coinjar with no issues. All were cash deposits over the counter at NAB and took a maximum of 3-4 hours to show up in the longest instance. It's important to remind the NAB people about the reference number- I've had a couple of experiences where they haven't entered it until I've reminded them. 
As for coinjar as a whole, although they have worked well for me this far, I am still extremely wary, and immediately withdrawal btc once a purchase is made. If you read up online there are definitely enough people that have an issue with the way that the owner left his last bitcoin business or more recently his domain hosting company.

Greatest crypto post ever
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:58:38
Agreed, about a year ago when I was looking for an exchange they seemed the most shady in appearance, but the actual usual experience has been way above any other. Extremely snappy trade engine, means no orders are ever in limbo ala Cryptsy.
Having said that, I only store a small amount it coins in there- and only what I am actively trading. Everyone should be cautious storing coins no matter what the exchange.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:09:39
Yes- I agree regarding the QR code in a general sense, however we're taking a slightly different approach as the videos are intended to stand alone so to speak with or without the bitcoin component- our aim isn't to create a YouTube site of street performers but rather create a unified ongoing video archive that can be viewed online, as traditional film or within museums. Once we launch it this aspect will become much clearer.
I think that as far as some of the older performers go- a qr code is something that they will understand better having gone through this initial experience- I can't emphasise enough the technological generation divide- even access to a printer is hard to come by for many of these people.

I agree- 21% considering Bitcoin is an absolutely huge number from where we are now. Also the fact that such a large percentage is unfamiliar with Bitcoin speaks to a reluctance to use it- once adoption and awareness increases this figure should change because people will actually be better informed to be able to use it. The generational perspective is to be expected- I for one can say that it would be harder to convince my elderly parents of Bitcoins virtues (I have tried) than it would to convince a friend in their early thirties.

It's depressing that this is on top of r/Bitcoin. Please google the owner Zhenya Tsvetnenko and see how he got his riches- he was basically a premium 'text service' scammer who preyed on everyday consumers. ie...   
 
We need to be getting away from people like Karpeles, and not celebrating them. I live in Australia and I was considering the stock when it first listed to diversify from my crypto and crypto-stock holdings, but when I looked at his background, in conjunction with a very ambiguous business plan (especially on the mining side) I decided to stay well away. This is a pump and dump stock for the original investors that will 'pump' with the promise of Bitcoin riches, and then dump when retail investors ask where their money has gone.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:37:47
$500. This is designed not to be a vehicle for speculation. So by the same line of thinking, if you transfer in $500 and a month later the price of BTC is only $200, your balance will still be $500. This is a system designed for the masses, or people uncomfortable about the volatility and risk of BTC.

Honestly the ATO ruling has ruined Coinjar for me in the short-term. Circle is now a better buying option from Australia. I may try the eftpos card once it is released, but I'm not really that enthused about having spending conversions done at coinjars so called 'fair rate'.

Thanks- we hope that it will fill a need within the bitcoin community and beyond. It will enable us to make the project entirely open source in terms of creation and funding.

This will allow people to support musicians/performers directly. This has no business model btw- we have and are facilitating this as a non-profit artist project.

Pulled from my ass? You are the one making the claims here- and it seems what you are talking about is something that was already addressed as being an issue of concern in the last letter to shareholders.

Good stuff. My father is still on the 'scam' side of the general collective thinking about bitcoin (despite my thorough explanations). My mother has a little btc that I bought for her- she sees how it works better than my father but she doesn't feel comfortable enough yet to buy any with her own money, which is fair enough. Anyway- my first priority really needs to be the texting business, and also making it so that the 'numbers' appear again on my fathers tv when he changes channels- apparently they disappeared one day, and it's been extremely frustrating for him!

Well- there's two parts to this- BTC-e has great service in terms of its trading engines and functionality. On the flip side, never ever store a large amount of coins on there- trade and then transfer to a secure wallet. I've been waiting for BTC-e to 'disappear' for a long time now- one day I think it's going to happen so just be careful you don't get caught at the end.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:34:44
Sure it is for a particular section of the population, but for an older generation who want to get their feet wet without 'risk' and currency fluctuation this is a better solution. It's not a solution that I will recommend to my own family necessarily because I believe in BTC in the longer term, but the reality is that Circle will provide a much more feasible on-ramp for a great deal of the population.

Well a big reason that I'm behind Bitcoin is that it allows me to transfer fiat money internationally a whole lot easier and without fees- something which I have to do one a weekly basis. For the most part I have done this with a spread of about +/- 1% (so yes sometimes a gain) depending on the exchange rate. This is as opposed to paying a minimum $12-25 +other exchange fees through banks or currency transfer services. I'm also able to execute my orders within minutes- the only lag being transferring money out of the exchange at the receiving end which takes a day- still faster than a 2-3 day bank service.

It might be good to try out a couple of different approaches. Maybe buy some btc through coinbase, the leave a little on there. Transfer the rest to a desktop wallet- just make sure to encrypt it with a secure password (that you will remember or can record somewhere extremely safe) and back up your wallet too. That's a nice little exercise in feeling more confident about some of the processes. Of course there are many different options, and cold storage for large amounts would be advised! Good luck ;)

I have transferred between Australia and New Zealand accounts for an average of about 1% over the course of approx four months (done fortnightly) ie. fiat $AUD to btc to fiat $NZD. Low liquidity on the Nz exchange end helps greatly in this- during the past two months there has only been one time when I haven't gained in the transaction- usually about 1%. This is in comparison to bank or currency transfer services where the beat possible transaction fee is $12AUD plus the spread on conversion which is always in the banks favour. I can not foresee myself using a bank wire or currency transfer service at any point in the near future.
