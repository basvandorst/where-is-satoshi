IN MY OPINION, WHALECLUB SCAMS ITS USER WITH CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT ETHER WAS AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORTH $1200-1500 USD, THEY HAVE ALLEGEDLY SCAMMED ME OUT OF $1000s WITHOUT MY ETHER OPTION MOVING MORE THAT 5%. DON'T BELIEVE ME? CHECK OUT MY 8TH EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE FINALLY REPLIED TO, LAUGH AT MY PAIN, AND RUN.
(HERE IS THEIR COMPLETELY TRASH RESPONSE TO MY 8TH INQUIRY. CHECK OUT THE FIRST TRASH SENTENCE. COMPLETELY TRASH. I DON'T KNOW WHO HIRED JEFFREY SACKS. COMPLETELY TRASH EMAIL)

I have been responding to your emails, perhaps you are not getting the replies. This is called "forced liquidation". This is not something special to Whaleclub, it's just regular margin trading. It happens when your P/L and financing exceed the total balance you have in your account. So to prevent a negative balance, your positions are liquidated at market price.

8th Request - Forced Liquidation and Financing Calculation Error
(HERE IS WHERE I BEGIN MY ASTUTE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THEIR ERROR)
There is an error in the financing data given by my most recent trade (4.3955 ETH). I obtained this data from clicking on the dashboard on the top right of my account (please see the full list of trade shown below). 
The financing charge given by  is 8% a day for ETHER/USD trades, which pertains to the trade in question (the rate given by whale.co here  ), my financing charge for 3 days would be no more than 24% leaving me with a positive balance at least 3 ETH (given my margin of 4.47)
(4.47 - (4.47*.24) - (4.47*.0432) = 3.1849) 
This trade was opened on March 30 and forced liquidated on April 2 (3 days) It reads margin at 4.47Eth and my Entry Price at 387.66 and my Leverage at 5x. My Close Price reads 391.01 and my P/L reads -4.32%.This leaves my total balance at 4.27689Eth without financing charges.
With financing charges(4.47 - (4.47*.24) - (4.47*.0432) = 3.1849)
According to your definition given in the previous email, forced liquidation occurs when my balance is not enough to cover my P/L + financing fees. According to the mathematical calculation shown including the P/L and the financing charge, my balance is largely positive and adequate to cover P/L and financing fees. If you could please help me, with a mathematical depiction of where I have gone wrong or how the forced liquidation was calculated, I would drop this inquiry and move on with more trades. If that is not possible, I would kindly appreciate a full refund.

IN MY OPINION, WHALECLUB SCAMS ITS USER WITH CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT ETHER WAS AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE WORTH $1200-1500 USD, THEY HAVE ALLEGEDLY SCAMMED ME OUT OF $1000s WITHOUT MY ETHER OPTION MOVING MORE THAT 5%. DON'T BELIEVE ME? CHECK OUT MY 8TH EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE FINALLY REPLIED TO, LAUGH AT MY PAIN, AND RUN.
(HERE IS THEIR COMPLETELY TRASH RESPONSE TO MY 8TH INQUIRY. CHECK OUT THE FIRST TRASH SENTENCE. COMPLETELY TRASH. I DON'T KNOW WHO HIRED JEFFREY SACKS. COMPLETELY TRASH EMAIL)

I have been responding to your emails, perhaps you are not getting the replies. This is called "forced liquidation". This is not something special to Whaleclub, it's just regular margin trading. It happens when your P/L and financing exceed the total balance you have in your account. So to prevent a negative balance, your positions are liquidated at market price.

8th Request - Forced Liquidation and Financing Calculation Error
(HERE IS WHERE I BEGIN MY ASTUTE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF THEIR ERROR)
There is an error in the financing data given by my most recent trade (4.3955 ETH). I obtained this data from clicking on the dashboard on the top right of my account (please see the full list of trade shown below). 
The financing charge given by  is 8% a day for ETHER/USD trades, which pertains to the trade in question (the rate given by whale.co here  ), my financing charge for 3 days would be no more than 24% leaving me with a positive balance at least 3 ETH (given my margin of 4.47)
(4.47 - (4.47*.24) - (4.47*.0432) = 3.1849) 
This trade was opened on March 30 and forced liquidated on April 2 (3 days) It reads margin at 4.47Eth and my Entry Price at 387.66 and my Leverage at 5x. My Close Price reads 391.01 and my P/L reads -4.32%.This leaves my total balance at 4.27689Eth without financing charges.
With financing charges(4.47 - (4.47*.24) - (4.47*.0432) = 3.1849)
According to your definition given in the previous email, forced liquidation occurs when my balance is not enough to cover my P/L + financing fees. According to the mathematical calculation shown including the P/L and the financing charge, my balance is largely positive and adequate to cover P/L and financing fees. If you could please help me, with a mathematical depiction of where I have gone wrong or how the forced liquidation was calculated, I would drop this inquiry and move on with more trades. If that is not possible, I would kindly appreciate a full refund.
Kind Regards,
Joshua
