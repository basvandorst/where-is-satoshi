For all the Hodlers... If you don't cash out to USD you don't have to report anything. When you get those massive gains and you're ready to cash out you move to Switzerland or Cayman islands and cash out there.

Most bubbles are constrained to one region with the exception of the dot com boom. So it can't be compared to tulips or housing. This is a global phenomenon that as it grows can only be compared to global economic events. It will be compared to the great depression if it fails. But if it thrives it can be compared to the likes of the industrial revolution or in today's era the internet.

For the same reason that you're new to the space and gravitated towards it. There are already better coins technologically. But you're here. Ask yourself why you are here and that's where you'll find the answer.

Well if it makes you feel any better, I'm only looking at 65% of what ever price it's at. Uncle Sam gets the rest... (USA) So for me it's $11k currently

So you're telling me I can't spend Bitcoin in another country without the US finding out? 
And that I can't set up my grandma with a Coinbase or exchange account linked to her Bank in her country and transfer her some Bitcoin and have her withdraw it for me?

IMO there's straight manipulation going on. Total Market cap staying the same yet Bitcoin starts dropping at 7:15pm and Bitcoin Cash starts going up at 7:25pm. Those are the only sizable movements going on in the market. The same whales that hoard both coins from the split are trying to elevate both coins by shifting between them, then buying in lower.

Hodling is easy to say when you're investment is worth under let's say $50k or so. If and when Bitcoin reaches $250k-$500k each then that will be harder to do. I imagine many sleepless nights if you don't have nerves of steel.

I'm not shit posting. I'm saying when newbies get on board this is exactly what every post is telling them to do. 
1.	Sign up with a reputable exchange 
2.	Buy what you can afford to lose 
3.	Establish a wallet and get it off the exchange. 
My question was how will it go mainstream if you're saying you have to know a lot about Bitcoin and invest huge amounts? When this isn't the case with other currencies...

Read in a Facebook post they were all leaving BTC and going to BCH yesterday. It looks like it's happening.

Update: Damn, after I logged in again now there's only 2.10 Bitcoins. So I'm confused.

I can't change the Kb's, and changing the amount to less gets worst! $64 to transfer $43! WTF!!! What a scam! Taking the hit and getting the fuck out of there! $158 to transfer $924!!! That's insane! Shocking I haven't heard more people complaining about this shit!

And why do they always ask "how much electricity does it take to sustain cryptocurrancies?" They never asked that when the internet started facilitating their fiat payment transactions!
