Thanks for the info, I have most of my btc on coinbase and will be moving those out right now.

I play on seals with clubs everyday but if a bigger more reputable site offered payouts in bitcoin i'd be there in a heart beat and so wouldn't everyone else. Poker is about volume, the more people the more fish. As for sports betting i do a little bit on nitrogen sports. Both sites are great and bitcoin is clearly perfect for gambling.

Do you put the cash in the micro USB slot? I'm having a tough time jamming hundred dollar bills in there.

Thanks, definitely an interesting concept paying for wifi per usage. I think a lot of these unique scenarios are possible but won't be existent for quite some time. It's good to know that people are creatively thinking these things through and it appears the possibilities of reality are likely.

Well that's unfortunate, looks like i'll be taking my business to tigerdirect...

goodluck, i hope you find them and then it will just be a lesson learned... 
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:38:59
I emailed them and they replied saying they will be emailing users in a few weeks (around the end of June) to get shipping details and other info and then hopefully sending them off soon after... It was something along those lines

Loving how they start at $650

You should post the entire .25 on the post office box on the corner of Dartmouth St. and Boylston. I bet someone will find it...

You get x amount of gyft points for every btc spent... 26 points for $8 sounds like 3 points for every dollar. When you have enough gyft points you can spend those like bitcoin.

Why is Coinbase worse than Blockchain?
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:44:41
Or 1 mbtc equals 60 cents. Just because 1 bitcoin is the standard unit doesn't mean it's expensive, it's just a unit. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:46:35
I would buy some to store in one wallet (invest) and then use another wallet for spending or just playing around to figure out how it works.

Mark Karpeles is selling them in the alley down the street from my apartment. Naw, I meant $570 each...

I think every tip gets tipped forward which is pretty cool but I'd love to see someone making a living off tips.
@_date: 2015-05-03 11:40:16
As someone who's never profited from bitcoin and still believes and uses it i've grown a custom to failing graphs and useless predictions. I know bitcoin will survive and thrive, you don't need to reassure me with graphs! None the less I do still like the bullish predictions... Anyways, donate to nepal and show why bitcoin has value. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:27:52
alright  i'll give you $3 if you explain this to me
@_date: 2014-06-04 01:12:47
I would stay away from any new/unknown sites until you hear from anyone. I lost about .36 btc on bitbet.com because they were they only bookie that had the sports bets I wanted. I use nitrogensports.com now and seals with clubs for poker and both have let me withdraw instantly.
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:15:52
I just sold 4 out of the 11 I have because I'm going on a trip to vegas next week and need the funds. I'm really not happy as I'm expecting the boom any time now. Every day I don't lose money I plan on buying them back and eventually by the end of the trip I hope to have them all back.

nitrogensports is setup so you van withdraw your winnings immediately after a session and I've never witnessed any funny business in the past few years. I trust them because they don't make me wait, boom, immediately withdrawn off their site and in my wallet. I think they only have blackjack for casino games but they have my trust over anyone else.

as weird as its perfect for webcam shows. i know chaturbate had it, not sure if they still do but it's literally working for your money. youtube is a bit similar where you can host a show or something and get paid. At the moment i just don't see .05 tips intriguing anyone.... I sent my buddy a $2 tip on twiitter and he could care less and i got it returned. Soundcloud market is with young unheard artists, hipsters i suppose hah
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:10:57
For sports betting it's the best... If you win your bitcoin is allocated to your account. If you'd like to withdraw you just punch in the address you'd like it to go to and it's sent. Have money in your own wallet minutes after a game has finished. Moderators keep their distance and let the website run based on math, the way it should be.
@_date: 2015-05-17 07:24:01
well theres a problem, i dont think tipping and exchanging tips is easy for most people.
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:06:43
The shares are already distributed to investors so you would have to buy them back which would kill you company. A new company however could do this, but wouldn't that be the same as buying stock? I think the more I think about it the more confused I'm getting, interesting concept though.

Sorry I saw it on another sub and thought it fit perfect for r/bitcoinmarkets....not trying to steal credit just posting something i thought would make people laugh
@_date: 2015-05-03 13:19:42
I totally stole it from r/poker but I just thought it was meant for this. everything is stolen nowadays though

You have over 2.000 vendors, sounds very functional.
@_date: 2015-03-29 03:48:41
nitrogensports.eu has no wait for deposits and withdraws, been using them for years now. They also have more lines than any other bitcoin site and decent odds. I don't trust cloudbet, it's not very user friendly and very slow on transactions.

I do not change the file type when I move it, it seems to be automatically changing. When I try to open it, it says "Cannot read wallet file". I open electrum and go to file - open - select the file.

perfect, thanks!
