What is a currency used for? Trading.... I can easily make a rock on the floor worth 5 cents... If it is 5 cents to you and me then we can use that as a currency..... Bitcoin to many people can be used for trade which makes it a currency - That being said the price is driven through speculation.

Also, it is the only mutual currency in the world... meaning that someone in America can exchange it with someone in France or in China or in Burundi...... There are tons of benefits.

It can help 3rd world countries with continued deprecation of their currency hold their money somewhere without it going down in value..... and much more.... do your research.

would you have to convert to usd in GDAX though?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:19:45
I think if you convert to USD and then send to your USD wallet on coinbase you also do not have to pay the fees to transfer to your bank. If you send eth or ltc to coinbase you would still have to pay some fees to transfer to your bank. Is this correct?
