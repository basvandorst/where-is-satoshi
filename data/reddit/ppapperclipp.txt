You, sir, are an idiot.

Again, theories are all great. I don't follow a particular theory. I follow the evidence which clearly shows that supply side is bullshit. 
Again, historically you are incorrect.
You really need to take your own advice there big guy. Follow the evidence. Look at history. You.are.wrong.
HAHAHHA and then you link a fucking libertarian youtube channel. Libertarians are a joke.

I suggest you get beyond econ 101 and your supply side bullshit.
Edit: I had to take masters level economic courses in order to get my MBA. Keep thinking that AM radio economics is right.

Wait, so you think you should get to pay a smaller percent of your income because you made more? That's insane!
Also, hire a new accountant.
Edit: apparently this is Trolling. Be careful or you will be baned.

Sorry, but libertarianism is bullshit. I have heard the arguments for it. Seen the evidence against it. 
If you would link a reasonable source with data and evidence to back up their beliefs I will happily read it. However, I am not waisting 33 minutes of my life watching a fucking YouTube video from a person who prescribes to one of the dumbest political movements in the US.
I wouldn't doubt if you are a flat-earther or anti-vaccine.

Also, nothing to 'argue' about with someone who thinks there shouldn't be any income tax and thinks everything the government does is bad.
You are a fucking joke. We have decades of evidence against supply side/trickle down/Reaganomics... whatever the fuck you want to call it. Throughout history, higher taxes have led to a stronger middle class and economy. 
The biggest problem facing our economy right now is a low aggregate demand. Lowering taxes does not fix this. Raising them and building infrastructure does. I mean, at least historically... if you look at the evidence.
