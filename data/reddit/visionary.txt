Remember that the days of seeing 1 digit, 2 digit, and 3 digit Bitcoin passed long ago.  I think we pretty much only have a few months for 4 digit Bitcoin before it's also gone forever.

I mean, The Prophecy said it's obvious if you look at the chart.
So look at it.

Just to provide a counterpoint, you realize that a ton of America's technological advancements were done by highly christian people?  Heck, Apollo 8 astronauts literally *read the book of Genesis out loud* as they came around the far side of the Moon during humanity's first lunar circumnavigation on Christmas Eve 1968.
Meanwhile the atheistic Khmer Rouge murdered a bunch of intellectuals to the point where there are fields littered with their skulls aptly named the "Killing Fields" that people (somewhat absurdly) go on tourist trips to visit in Cambodia.


The most amusing part of a Swede saying this is that your people (and the Norwegians) routinely give out their "smartest person in the world in x discipline" award (the Nobel Prize) to....Americans.

The hope is that, as one option, you'll be able to keep it there and establish a line of credit off of that BTC (the way you do for, say, a credit card in USD) in different forms (say, both USD and BTC), and then you'd pay it off with BTC every month.  Hence, you don't have to "move money" for expenditures constantly -- just every month or whatever to pay off the crypto and USD debt you've incurred each month.

The debt basically just shifted from personal balance sheets to corporate balance sheets.  The US is at its highest corporate debt to GDP ratio in a quarter century.  And China is not only worse, it piled on a massive amount in basically 10 years.
Instead of subprime mortgages, it's subprime corporate debt.  All of that QE and cheap money since 2008 to "stimulate the economy" made everyone loan these companies a ton of money that they likely won't be able to pay back.  The Chinese are already blowing up in this area:

Sure, but making utterly asinine claims like "almost 11 percent of Americans own bitcoin" suggests an inchoate and, might I say, novice take of the situation.
As an example, an article [literally today suggested that there are 27 million economically viable bitcoin addresses.](  If "11 percent of Americans" owned Bitcoin, that that would mean something like 31-32 million Americans separately own Bitcoin.  Basic math would suggest that was poor analysis on the part of our intrepid young redditor aged commenter above.
Bayesian inference, then, would make knowing one is a "redditor for 6 weeks" material, if even only slightly, to his inaccuracy.

...wait, no.  US corporate debt levels are higher than they were pre-2008 recession - and anytime in the last quarter century -, and this is coupled with the fact that it occurred during cheap money/QE (as opposed to rising interest rates that tend to happen as things boom).  Here's another article:


Canada's is EVEN WORSE, yes, in nominal terms (and China HORRIBLE), but the US isn't "healthy" by any stretch of the imagination.  Even the FED pointed out that rising corporate debt is a major factor in future potential economic instability precisely because cheap money is permitting loans to shittier businesses:
Literally from the FED's own analysis on title page 17 (Page 21 is even more useful):
"While household borrowing is at a low-to-moderate level relative to incomes, **business-sector debt relative to GDP is historically high and there are signs of deteriorating credit standards Overall, vulnerabilities arising from total private-sector credit appear moderate. Among businesses, debt levels are high, and there are signs of deteriorating credit standards. In addition, recently, debt has been growing fastest at firms with weaker earnings and higher leverage.** By contrast, household borrowing has advanced more slowly than economic activity and is largely concentrated among low-credit-risk borrowers."

Glad I avoided that obvious scam!  Now let me, the savvy unscammed investor, invest in conjured up financial instruments that are being inflated away by a currency that's being devalued at a higher and higher rate and have someone charge me a fee for the privilege every year for 40 years!

To be frank, I don't particularly understand how to convince you then.  US Corporate Debt to GDP is higher than it has been in 25 years (basically the entire graph shown, so possibly EVER) and the FED's own report agrees with me (all sourced for you), particularly because the \*nature of the loans given out\* is in a climate of cheap money, so credit standards are relaxed, just like what happened with subprime mortgages.
Let me put it to you this way, on this graph the shaded regions are recessions.  Notice how the last 30 years each recession is concordant with a spike on the graph of corporate debt to GDP?  See where we are now?
If you're arguing that the US is better than other countries, sure, but that doesn't make the US situation "healthy".

100K happens middle of next year, IMO.  5 years it basically provides the same value as Gold (so around 350K).
Think about history - where the undervalued major asset was when each previous generation started to have children, and into where their assets flowed:
Gold was our grandparents' store of value.  It was priced at 35/oz when they began making money.  1945-1980 went from 35 to 600.  An increase of 17-18x.
Index funds were our parents' store of value.  SP500 PE ratio was 7.39 which was on par with the lowest in history, when they started to make money.  1980 - 2015 went from 110 to 3000, an increase of 29-30x.   Note the higher multiple -- fiat came off the gold standard in 1971.  Boomers were the first to experience fiat devaluation in earnest.
Bitcoin is our generation's store of value.  Everything else is expensive, relatively speaking (Gold is at 1400, SP500 PE ratio is in the 20's).  Price is 10K, wouldn't surprise me if 2015 - 2040 it went up even more astronomically (like 150x) precisely because devaluation of fiat, against which all of these values are measured, is now taking off like never before in modern history.

I wouldn't say shocking considering it literally happens on this subreddit even with the evidence of potentially massive gains as shown there now known to virtually everyone.
@_date: 2019-08-10 23:55:46
Yes but they can only do that if they have tremendous liquidity, or they risk losing over a billion dollars, possibly more.
And if they have tremendous liquidity, then the price of Bitcoin will likely increase after they've sold, since so many people wish to buy that much at one time.

All else held equal, they all prefer that.
So I guess every man who wants a woman is screwed.

That would accelerate its value proposition, yes, but even if you just argued that Bitcoin's value (that of being an un-hackable ledger) stayed exactly the same, it will go UP in terms of USD value simply because of inflation.
In other words, everything that is scarce (say, a painting) will go up in USD denominated value over time because of inflation.  Bitcoin is UNIQUE in the sense that its value is ALSO goes up with increased inflation of fiat.

Please.  A survey of 2900'ish people paid for by a blockchain company in a notoriously difficult to poll space is going to make an inference about 31 million people?   Might as well just ask redditors and make global conclusions about everything!
Learn legitimate statistical inferential techniques prior to making these claims, yo.  Start with "random sample" and "unbiased".
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:27:15
Yep, basically around 11100 to 11200 is support.  If we correct beneath to 10800 or 10900 then there's a chance for 4 digit bitcoin again.
