That we re probably gonna fall the same distance one more time at least.
Actually I belive this is end of bitcoin grow - now we gonna fall for looooooooooong time. (but this reddit made religion of BTC growth so no point in saying this :D)

XRP is centralized product of a bank.
Not saying that BTC does not suck as money transport.

You are right, H&amp;S to be legit though to be FINISHED have to be confirmed by pullback to the neckline with significant volume. So this is not the pattern yet.

If one fact about price is undeniable it is that price trends. We are in a downtrend since January of last year. There are no actual signs of long-term reversal so far so if you buy right now (\~$4k) there is a good chance that you are buying local high. Just wait for a new low then buy or at least wait for the price to go back to last low area (\~$3400). I personally think that we will go lower than that (may change opinion depending on how price reacts when coming back to bottom though).
Nothing is for sure and making long-term predictions is pointless (every analysis should be adjusted to information given by market most recently) but investing now would with good probability be an early call.  
Edit:  
Also when investing the only thing you want to focus on is to buy the asset as cheap as possible thus waiting is a good move now.

Those who understand Elliott Waves know that triple three is stil in play, thus we can easily go much lower.
The question is whether spike (which I think is coming soon) is correction in downtrend or start of uptrend.
Edit: This applies even if your wave count is correct.
Edit 2: Wave (X) is corrective wave thus it never consists of five waves thus your numbering (at least in this aspect) is wrong.
Edit 3: I agree that we are around end of second wave C of double three but have open mind please :)
