I think it is completely reasonable to be against bitcoin and crypto in general, especially for people that are older.   
They think of Bitcoin and probably have a flash-back of what it was like trying to set up a com to make a forum post back in the day and thing... No. That won't work.   
Interesting piece nonetheless.

Well thanks for the input, I'll remember to not share anywhere but one subreddit and keep all these communities insular from now on.
Thanks for policing the forums we can have a nice place to share links officer.

Look, I personally like it. I am torn, because this is my media but also I really like Richard Heart. So I am in a really uncomfortable place...  
But this does bring up some interesting points. Then again so does Heart...

It should be stressed, after last December, the worst time to find out there a problem is during the problem. Lol

It's not in all subs?
Only the ones it is related to. /r cryptocurrency, btc, Bitcoin and bitcoinhex 
I will gladly pull it off these if that's against the rules.
