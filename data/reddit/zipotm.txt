Thank you for that info, I'm currently re-syncing from the beginning using my paper backup. Will make some SCB and channels.backup recovery tests.

Hello, it's me, ZipoTm.
Looks like a lot of people are interested in my case. I'm not lying, 3,80518956 BTC are still missing as explained here: [
I've already restored my node from a paper 24 words backup. Currently trying to import all channels from a binary static channel backup file to make some progress and bring back my funds (hopefully). Will keep you updated.
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:58:26
bro, it doesn't matter if they are 0.0004, 4 or 444... that software must be good enough to work well when you have tons of backups, am I right?
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:43:45
Hi Timmy,
No, my view of Bitcoin is the same, it's an awesome technology, and will still be.
Basically it's caused by my own mistake, because of the server power fail... I though that with my file backups I'm really safe... already have some suggestions to improve the system:
1. Implement **build-in, automised, constantly enabled by default** 1second or whatever needed static channel backups (*because as moli said, even 10 minutes old backup may cause a breach! Which means that all current backups are unuseful*)
2. When force closing channels with **"synced\_to\_graph": false** status, to have additional red "WARNING!" message like that "ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU WANNA FORCE CLOSE THOSE CHANNELS WITHOUT SYNCED GRAPH? YOU MAY LOOSE ALL OF YOUR CHANNEL FUNDS" with yes/no confirmation.
3. A kind of a channel protection which will stop the other side from taking the channel funds (*as I know it's already implemented*) + self-funded watchtower balance as a "channel state safety" tax which other nodes will use (*this one should be more complex, because will need to calculate the game theory results*)
It's just too unserious to have static file backups for the last 320 days + static channel backups + 24 words paper backup... and to loose everything with one single call which was **allowed**. I'm just a naive person to trust that technology so much, it's my own fault. Btw they are doing a great job, coding as much as they can.

LN is developing really well btw, I just wanted to share my own experience with it.

Bitcoin Cash is bullshit and will ever be.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:59:50
Nope, the main reason of my fault was that I've force-closed more than 400 channels without synchronized node, after that pressed Ctrl + C few times and because of the panic tried tons of different (dumb) ways... instead of waiting the software to proceed.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:55:22
Yes, I thought that I lost 4 BTC, but looks like they wasn't lost at all. It was my own technical mistake and now trying to give some good advices how to prevent such cases.
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:52:05
Will send you an email about that within 1-2 days.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:14:12
"the problem with this dude was that he forced closed all his channels at once while they werent synced" - YES, EXACTLY, that was the main reason! But if you have 7 BTC in your node, my simple advice is that's better to have a UPS device just in case, why not.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:05:45
That's not for the average persons, that's about people who wanna host LN nodes for their business or something else. Average person will just install a mobile LN wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:56:25
It's really easy, just install some of the LN mobile wallets, my favourite is called Blue Wallet ( Computer scientists and coders are behind it!
