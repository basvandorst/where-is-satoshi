I'm going to do you one better and call you tomorrow.

I want regulation and rules, and less over all corruption in the system - bitcoin can offer that through quantitative, distributed, and impersonal processes.
Libertarians just open the door for bad characters.  As bitcoin grows, libertarians need to grow up or get out.

Pink Cow is a fun foreigner joint in Tokyo.  I used to go there all the time.

Can someone ELI5 the 10 years / hand over to state part?
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:34:26
Are you kidding?  HAVE YOU READ THE CONSTITUTION!?

Sigh, still waiting since June 4 for my invite.

This is what happens when you teach English for min-wage too long.  This guy sounds like he's in a fucking psychosis.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:40:28
Those were my thoughts as well.

I think if someone with degrees and awards in a relevant technology focus AND economics is what everyone here needs.

David, I'd encourage you to read the forum more and also look at Mt. Gox is, unfortunately, actively committing fraud or is incredibly incompetent.  It hasn't been able to scale with the growth of the currency and the new players have become more relevant.
Ultimately, they've become so untrustworthy, even with their PR on the issue, that you might as well be gambling by paying 50% value to maybe get a coin later on.  
I've seen your posts on Stocktwits and you are very behind on news and the industry.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:24:59
Oh, I know it's not.  I can PM you for confirmation if you'd like.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:29:18
Maybe you should actually read the article instead of assuming it's fuzzy feel good koolaid...
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:05:07
Articles like these are still important - otherwise we just become an echo chamber of people patting ourselves on the back.
If you are subscribed to Motley, you should keep your subscription because their insights and track record is usually good.
At the same time, stay critical of everything from everywhere.  Healthy skepticism.
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:17:22
Maybe.  But I just shared an article from the Washington Post I thought was interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:53:31
It would be nice if I could display my bitcoin along with my stocks on personalcapital.com using this.
@_date: 2014-08-24 08:56:44
Depends on what country.

Second that, OP sounds like a fucking creep.

The creator of litecoin is an American who works for Coinbase as an Engineer VP.

Because of the amount of funding.  That's pretty serious cash, even for a non-bitcoin related Bay Area company getting venture / angel cash.
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:04:12
Thank you for the clarification, sir!  
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:04:19
Because these are assumptions we are making about who would probably be against bitcoin, based on what it does, versus a public, verifiable statement.
I'm just more curious who has actually come out and put themselves in the spotlight as being anti-bitcoin.  Hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:02:41
Coinbase seems fine, and they actively read/participate on this forum.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:29:19
So in the meantime, treat them like a growing asset and not a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:31:27
Coinbase feels extremely well built and is very popular here- it's also got like 7m venture funding and I'm personally expecting great things about it.
That being said, I have no idea about Europe.  Also, forget anonymity- they need to know who you are before you fund an account.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:27:15
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:06:51
I didn't know that!  This is the kind of thing I wanted to know, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:17:29
They just did.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:53:19
I'm pretty sure everyone with a few bitcoins is watching the price like a hawk, especially with the news.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:14:07
Sounds like me.  Is this normal?  I thought I was just doing really well...  :(
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:46:03
I just dump whatever I can afford during the crashes, and a little bit every week in nice round USD -&gt; BTC.
