Still, there are many skins that are not available that didn't come with a code, such as King Rammus.

Okay now that you mention it, the graphs of bitcoins and the NASDAQ are creepily aligned.
I [overlayed the two graphs]( and every significant dip and hill is on both graphs.

This. I believe LocalTill charges a certain percentage plus a random amount of cents in their fee, so if you deposit $20 it may cost you $22.08 while it costs someone else $22.05.

Why would we want to associate Bitcoins with pornography?

I think you mean like 0.5%.
$0.29 is 0.659% of $43.99.

Wait what?
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:55:40
Seems legit

Keep change the scale and timeline of any currency and it's bound to match up with Bitcoins.

I can read, it was more of a list of how many there are that are unavailable.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:51
Someone is a lucky duck :P
That 20 btc is *a few times* larger than my current 0.14 btc :P
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:46:21
But they are currently *un*available and will be *un*available in the future, which was my original point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:09:02
I mean sure, if you gave Riot a billion dollars I'm sure they'd perhaps give you Team Spirit Anivia.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:04:21
Yeah I believe people were doing it so much that Riot got mad and stopped it because it was supposed to be a one-time special case.

Who said I have all the money I need? I'm a college student in debt to many, you probably have more money than I do.
And from the 7 links I clicked on from your blog post, all 7 had a bitcoin ad to click past.

I'm sure the number of people mining will go down, and there will be less people buying GPUs to mine with. But if the number of people mining drops by a bit and the average miner speed increases significantly, the overall hashrate will still increase a lot.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:45:13
Yup, seems like the scumbag DDoS attackers are at it again.

@_date: 2013-04-21 04:40:35
You are right, I assumed the price will stay at around $125/btc, as short-term (read: a few weeks to a month) I don't expect the price per btc to change more than $10-15.
And I'm not sure what you mean by "The increase in difficulty to get them". When I said "difficulty" I was meaning the bitcoin block difficulty.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:29:59
Yeah, it wasn't much money ($20, the minimum BitFloor allows), so I'm not concerned with losing it all, though some profit would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:42:19
Damnit I wanted the $149 one
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:59:30
That's crazy to think that was only 9 months ago. Multiplying your money by over 200 times in 9 months is sick.
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:20:23
Lol why would you buy at a sudden spike?
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:30:02
I downloaded the new version, but it's sitting at 0.00%
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:32:44
Hah, I'm proud of my massive 0.14 bitcoins, just be happy with what you have.
And most likely he was one of the buyers back when one bitcoin was a penny or so. Just think, if you invested $75,000 at $0.01 each, you would have 7,500,000 bitcoins, worth about 1 to 2 billion dollars (based on today's prices).

Ah, that's true.
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:14:23
After power costs and such it'll probably be about 0.28 (edit: 0.3 as has pointed out) btc per day. At current prices this is about $35 (edit: $38) a day, which would pay the device off after 8 days. **This will not be the case when these devices hit the market as the massive increase in hash rate will result in a big jump in difficulty.**
I would expect when consumers have these devices that you could get maybe 0.05 to 0.1 btc ($6-$12) a day, which still isn't bad.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:57:06
btc-e is a lot better
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:02:03
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to check your email, you should have gotten a memo.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:42:10
Just think, if you invested $100 when 1 btc was $0.01, you would have about $2,300,000 worth of bitcoins right now.
My brain just can't fathom that.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:09:53
You bought when $13 was 1 btc? I envy you.
I looked into bitcoins late 2011 (when it was around $3 per btc). To think, if I invested $20 then, I would have just under $1000 now :(

Yeah, I'm not sure if it will drop that low. I would reasonably expect to make around $2-$3 a day with one.

Oh okay.

The fuck are these prices?
0.275 btc for a 24 ounce bag of pine nuts? That's nearly $39 worth of bitcoins for some nuts.

This past winter they brought back some *legacy* skins (see [here]( while the ones I listed are *limited edition* skins (see [here]( which "will not be released from the vault for further purchasing."
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:36:35
You're right, but I was being a little conservative and including other things may go wrong. BFL themselves say their devices may be up to 10% off. So you may get 4.5 Gh/s or 5.5 Gh/s.
Even at 0.307 btc/day it would still be about $38 a day which isn't too far off.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:47:57
How so? You can't transfer the skins between accounts, so even if you found someone willing to sell one to you, you couldn't get it onto your account.
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:16:15

Pretend the top 500 super computers can eat 1 million apples a day.
This is basically say that although the bitcoin network is actually eating 160,000 oranges a day, it *could* be eating 8 million apples a day.
So is it? No. But it *could*.

Ugh, I just bought my first bitcoins when it was at $135 earlier.

@_date: 2013-04-30 03:33:47
Note to everyone thinking about ordering one now to get in on that sweet 0.3 btc per day: by the time you receive yours, the difficulty will be a lot higher due to more ASICs mining. I would expect to get 10-20% of this, if not less.
@_date: 2013-05-24 05:16:02
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:45
I thought they stopped doing that a while ago?
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:58:59
Perhaps have a screen for the whole lot that you go to and enter the parking spot and then it shows a QR code for you to send to.
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:15:51
No clue, I haven't looked into it enough.
But think about it, what is the demand if the device makes $38 a day? It would be ridiculously high as it would pay itself off in less than 9 days.
Now if it made only $6-$12? The demand would definitely be lower as it would take 1-2 months to pay off. It may make even less than that.
The current difficulty is just under 9 million, if I had to make an estimate I'd say the difficulty will be in the range of 35-55 million when these devices are available to the public, though I could see it being lower or higher than that range. If the difficulty increased to around 114 million then the 5Gh/s miner would still make about $3 a day. I would be surprised if the difficulty shoots up that high.
Here's a table to tickle your fancies:
| Difficulty   | Approximate profit/day @ 5Gh/s   |
9 million (current)           |                 $38
15 million                        |               $22.80
25 million                         |            $13.68
50 million                          |            $6.84
75 million                           |           $4.56
100 million                           |         $3.42
150 million                            |        $2.28
250 million                             |       $1.37
500 million                              |      $0.68
1 billion                                   |    $0.34

@_date: 2013-05-15 16:46:30
So if I bought a share at 1.7 btc, and the dividends are paid once a week, and the average dividend is about 0.01 btc, it would take 170 weeks (over 3 years) to break even?
Even if all dividends were 0.0362, it would still take almost a year to break even.
I'm not seeing how this is worth it =/
