I used Coinbase up until they raised their rates.  I just made a purchase with Circle and it went well too.  I'm in the USA btw.
Basic guidelines:
1.  Buying BTC with bank transfers the rates are typically 1 to 2%, but can take longer to settle.  I think debit cards are charged about the same.
2. If you use your credit card you will pay a premium (2-3%), using PayPal can make this even higher (6%).
3. Buying anonymously (Localbitcoins.com) will command even more of a premium.
4.  Coinbase, Circle, etc are regulated financial institutions and will request full documentation on you.  Name, address, picture of your ID, etc.
5. It's great that you created a wallet, move your bitcoins to it as soon as possible.  Don't lose the recovery info for your wallet.
6.  Buy only what you can afford to lose.  Buying $10 is fine.  I had a weekly buy setup at Coinbase - this is a great way to increase your BTC holdings.  Unfortunately Circle doesn't have recurring buys afaik, maybe if enough people ask...

What if we could 2FA companies?
The app has to correctly display the *next* "number" that the official website will display?
Maybe there is something more elegant?
Just to explain, I would visit breadwallet.org on the web, as well as have the app open on a "confirmation" page.  The website is displaying 738916 for 10 seconds. My phone is displaying 298766.  The ten seconds elapse and the website now shows 298766.  My phone always shows the next number that will appear on the website.
Edit: Just realized this wouldn't work, the attacker could just rebroadcast the official prediction from another phone.
Edit 2:  I suppose you could rely on timing, i.e.  the numbers no longer "predict" but have to change at exactly the right time and the user would have to notice the discrepancy.

To tunnel home I need to have a server (or specialized router) running in my home?  Check.
This server will be more affordable than my current banking setup?  False.  I pay zero for my bank account.  Also, your handy calculation of my energy use ignored the cost of a server.
But, let's assume you get the cost of the (software project unicorn) router to the cost of my current router.  And let's assume setup is a breeze (though you have never dealt with my mom on a technical level).
What happens if my router goes down while I'm away?
What percentage of people will pay money for hardware when they could just use a web wallet?
And, more to the point, how is any of this simpler than a mobile wallet?

This is the text from an online description of the insurance policy provided to BitGo by Bitcoin Financial Group.
Bitcoin Theft Insurance
BitSecure™, our proprietary bitcoin theft Insurance policy, is a bespoke insurance product customized for each customer. The policy provides a robust cyber and professional liability policy that goes well beyond narrow crime policies previously adopted by some bitcoin vault providers.
The policy protects both the corporate policyholder and well as its customers from any act, error, or omission of an Insured (including errors in technology, processes, and employees) which result in a theft of Insured Bitcoins (or their related private keys).
Coverage extends to both external hacking incidents and employee theft. Both hot wallets and cold storage are eligible for coverage in the policy.
In the event of a covered loss, the policy would reimburse a customer, as a direct loss payee (a feature not available in any other insurance program!) for the full value of the stolen Insured Bitcoins, subject to the full terms of the policy. In addition, the policy provides the corporate policyholder with unprecedented ability to work directly with it customers in the management and resolution of such incidents.
Bitcoin Financial Group’s new to the market Bitcoin Theft Insurance policy announced on February 25, 2015 has been called a “defining moment” in insurance for the bitcoin industry.

Yeah, I don't know much, but you guys have a lot of it wrong.  Good on ya for discussing it though.
Somewhere between using BTC as a currency and the blockchain as an immutable ledger, you find the value of "Bitcoin".
The actual "dollar" value is decided on via trading (against USD/EUR/etc.) in an open and free market.
True currency is valuable through its scarcity and fungibility.
Gold is very scarce and (essentially) impossible to create.  Everyone accepts gold, hence it is fungible.  It's a great currency.
Until it comes to moving it around.  Then you need paper notes secured by the gold.  You have to trust a government to give you your gold if you ask for it.
Paper money backed by gold eventually became to "cumbersome".  And the Feds decided to back our paper with the promise of our economies productivity.
That's where we are now.  Paper (or electronic) money backed by debt.  It works *alright*, but opens the door to all sorts of policies that "kick the can" of a poorly performing economy down the road.
Armed with tools to avoid short-term downturns, the Feds aim to stabilize the economy.  Mainly, they manipulate interest rates and print money.  Constantly.  And everything they are doing at this point is experimental (negative interest rates?).
Why is the most basic aspect of our economy determined by a small cabal of non-elected, private individuals?  Why doesn't the invisible hand guide interest rates? Why would the Fed print more money than it destroys?
Bitcoin returns us to gold.  Not the "gold standard" which was secured by a government, but true gold coins in your pocket.  It is highly scarce - just try to find 1 bitcoin and you will realize how scarce - you will use significant electricity mining for one.
Okay, so you know the computer is mining  for bitcoin by solving these hard equations?  Those equations are securing the network.
When I say I have sent a bitcoin to you, how do you know?  How are you sure I didn't just make one up?  Who can you verify that with?
The blockchain, that's who.  It's a distributed ledger that is created and agreed upon by competing miners.  They all want to solve the next "block" of transactions so they can get a bitcoin reward (12.5 BTC/block).  Their math secures your transaction.  Their math problem is hard to solve, but the answer is easy to verify.
So now you have a bitcoin. It's as scarce and fungible as a piece of gold.  More fungible if you consider it can be sent electronically.  It's a great currency.
But it's more than that.
The blockchain is immutable.  No changes.  No backsies.  This lets you create permanent records that can never be falsified, replicated, etc.  This immutability can be leveraged to provide smart contracts.
This is a big deal, because it means you can have "trustless" business dealings.  You can enter into secure agreements where you don't have to trust other parties.

Bingo.  The government provides theses services to ensure the stability and productivity of it's workforce.  It's a self-serving policy.  That's why they are *rights*, but that's just semantics.
It's simple to see the utility if you consider the costs of reactionary spending versus preventative measures.
Clean water - do you want cholera outbreaks or clean water?
Education - do you want unemployable workforce or a well-educated populace prepared for the modern world?
Healthcare - do you want a diabetic blind amputee or just give them some insulin?  Do you want malnurished children or the healthy workers?
The list goes on.
Housing?  It's cheaper to just give someone an apartment than to deal with the inevitable crime and property value decline that comes with homelessness.
Internet as a human right?  Your country better have it or it will get left behind in the new economy.

You think web wallets are more user friendly than Copay, Airbitz, etc?


"Strictly over the web"?  What do you mean?  As opposed to in-person exchanges of paper wallets?  Of course they do it over the web.  I'm pretty sure that's all we are talking about?


I would think if you had sizable wealth, that would be the primary situation for running your own server.


I don't doubt that web wallets (and the like?  What's that?) could suffice.
What I doubt is their security and legitimacy.  Also, in general, the UI of webpages do not compare favorably to dedicated apps.
@_date: 2016-08-08 10:26:12
Ostensibly, traditional banking apps would seem equally vulnerable.
However,  the name recognition of "Fidelity" or "CitiBank" probably helps app reviewers weed out copycats.
And then there is the threat of legal action.  Which is almost non-existent with bitcoin wallet companies, but a very real threat when with dealing with a large bank/brand.  The copycats would avoid the hard targets.
And the final difference would be when "XYZ Giant Bank Corp" calls Apple to complain - they actually get heard.

People asking for free university education aren't generally asking for free loans, just free education.  State Universities.  Local colleges.  These are already state-owned entities that could offer services for free.
Instead of giving away loans that end up padding the pockets of private organizations, give away education.
Make student loans *less* attractive and more restrictive.  This would put downward price pressure on private colleges as more people begin to choose the state-offered education.

It was a rhetorical question.  I could have phrased it "uBTC? why not mBTC?".
And easier?  Says who?  I mean I agree, but isn't that an opinion?  If we are going to get rid of decimals, why not get rid of all of them?  This is what I mean by arbitrary.
While working solely in bits would be nice, I'm still ready to argue in favor of "microbits" over "bits".  "Bits" conveys no information about decimal location.  We can still *call* them bits, but we should *write* it uBTC/μBTC.
IMHO, it should be BTC, mBTC, and μBTC.  Bitcoin, millibitcoin, and microbitcoin.  Those are good, official names.  They convey decimal information correctly.  Any app or website that deals in bitcoin should have those denominations as options and NOT colloquial names like "bit".
Now, the populace?  Who knows what we will decide on.  Who knows what we will call it, who cares.

Yes, I was confused, because you literally said you would donate if they made the bitcoin option as prominent.
Now, it is understandable that you meant that you would only donate if your favorite, but somewhat obscure and misunderstood payment option was given equal grounds with long established, reliable donation options.
Sorry I didn't see your obtuseness from around the corner.
I imagine the donation committee has enough data to know where donations are coming from.  Of course they will give precedence to those services through which most the donations flow.
Now, if a "small" community like all gave a small amount of bitcoin and it amounted to something significant, that donation committee might take notice.  It might even make a press release, raising awareness of your favorite currency.
Or yeah, we could wait for another Wikipedia.  Undoubtably it will be run at a monetary loss with no advertisements by a generous non-corporate benefactor.

Granted, this is just more of a "what if?".


I would think this too, but how does a contractor report this expenditure?
Let's say a US contractor buys $100,000 worth of bitcoin from a reputable and FICA reporting company - Coinbase for example.  We will assume Coinbase notes this transaction with the Feds.  The contractor moves all BTC to a private wallet.  The contractor then pays their worker in BTC (from private wallet to private wallet).
At the end of the year there are no more bitcoin in the contractors possession.  The worker uses the bitcoin for internet purchases and also has no bitcoin remaining.  There is of course a record on the blockchain, but no fiat exchanges were made.
Is there currently no method for the US government to tax the above arrangement?
Doesn't the contractor have to account for the $100,000 purchase?
Assuming the contracted worker never converted to fiat, what do they pay taxes on?  I would guess that (ethically) the worker should report their income (in USD) at the time of payment and pay income taxes on that accordingly, correct?
It seems like at some point the government would need to be doing some block exploring themselves to make sure everyone is reporting everything.  Even with the tracing capabilities of the blockchain it seems like that would be a daunting task in a mature bitcoin environment.

The power of bitcoin is not the anonymity of mined coins.  That barely makes sense - no user is expected to be mining to obtain their bitcoin.
Running a node or mining are simply not cost effective for me.  Electricity is exorbitant here and internet access is average - I'm certainly not going to downgrade it to run a node or mine.
So I purchase bitcoin, bump it to my personal wallet and it's mine.  If I need to anonymize it, I'm sure I could come up with a few ways.

There is a big battle about encryption in the US right now, specifically regarding smartphones.
Obama likened the secure space inside a modern smartphone to a Swiss bank account; i.e. invulnerable to attack and a respite for the nefarious.
Bitcoin, like a Swiss bank account, allows you to store a large amount of wealth.  And it fits in your pocket.  And it's secured against intrusion with strong encryption.
So, "A Swiss bank account in your pocket" gives a pithy (if not completely accurate) description of Bitcoin.

Well, mail robots were still a thing the last time I roamed a big corporate law office (a decade ago).  It was just a dumb box that roamed around a set pattern and delivered mail.
But it seems that email has driven them to obsolescence.  However, robots that deliver drugs in hospitals are common enough.  In any case these are the most boring robots.  They barely think for themselves and are more machine than robot.
And just so you know, I too live in the real world.  I understand that delivery entails more than driving.
If you truly need an actual bipedal robot (debatable for deliveries), this was fairly state of the art a year ago:
I don't think it's inconceivable that in 5 years we could have robots doing many menial tasks in unforgiving environments.
5 years ago there were probably zero dynamically balanced, autonomous bipedal robots.  Now we have one that can walk in snow.  The new one can jump. On its wheel-feet.
But let's posit some options that could happen *within* 5 years.  Not that these would take over an industry immediately, but that they are feasible:
1. A new city delivery service uses automated vehicles. The package is dynamically routed to the users location at a prearranged time.  The upside is a lower cost and flexible delivery.  The downside is the customer must walk to the van and retrieve their own delivery.  Sounds terrible.
2.  Autonomous semi-trailer trucks travel between cities and can handle highway driving.  Truck "yard" drivers are employed for the tricky bits at the "last mile".
3.  Bus routes get automated.
4.  Taxi cabs get automated.
Basically any driving scenario becomes automated.  Minor issues with the road can be handled with a "manual" mode controlled via remote.

It's not "all drivers" that we should concerned about.
There is almost no incentive for me to purchase a self-driving vehicle and I imagine I'm not alone.  Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with the idea, it just doesn't apply to me now (personally, I'd love to be driven around).
But there is a group of people who it does affect.  Any company that operates a vehicle fleet.
Think 18-wheelers.  Think delivery vans.  Think city messengers.  Rental cars.
Say you run an in-city delivery company - why buy a $25K car and pay a $25K salary for low-skilled, high-risk employee?  Just buy a $75K self-driving van and make deliveries 24/7, get your money back in less than 2 years.
This model applies to any company employing low-skilled laborers.  Warehouse robots can stack shelves.  Mail robots deliver in-house mail.  More and more basic jobs will be replaced.

Well there is an old saying:
"In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." - Benjamin Franklin
I was basically not paying my taxes as a private contractor thinking I was making too little for them to care.
They cared.
There were fines, but I got those dropped, almost any sob-story will get them dropped.  Got on a payment plan and all is okay now. Dealing with it sucked, and there were some skinny months for a while.  
On the other hand I was able to "invest" the money I wasn't paying in taxes in some other "enterprises" which gave better returns than the interest on the payment plan.  Let's just say they were the kind of investments that don't file 1099's.
In all, I probably came out slightly ahead.  But it wasn't really worth the hassle, I'll just pay my taxes correctly from now on.

So why would one run this expensive database? To secure data against manipulation by their enemies.  And their enemies would do the same.  And third parties. And so on until it is fully distributed.
But how could a new chain possibly compete with the bitcoin blockchain?  Well basically 7,000 nodes isn't that many servers.  A bunch of banks and universities and governments could all run servers that verify a master, agnostic blockchain using a standard open source software. That would be plenty of servers.
Why not just use the bitcoin blockchain?  Because it wasn't really made for this, no matter how much better it does things than existing procedures.  Because money is attached directly to the chain it invites volatility, market forces, etc. to the detriment of the network.  Because mining  adds unneeded complexity.

It's the same process as every other exchange, and Coinbase warns the user about transfer times.
You get the amount of Bitcoin shown on the screen when you click buy and they comp the outbound transfer fees.
It couldn't be less opaque.
Nothing changes after you purchase except your fiat-based perception of the coins value.
If your main issue is that where you plan to use the coins will change their BTC price, just buy some extra BTC.
It's the same as if you were going to exchange $ for € and didn't know exactly what the exchange rate would be in 10 days.
If you use Gemini or GDAX, you can fund a Dollar based account on their site. Once the money is transferred, you can instantly purchase at spot price with very low fees.  
Even in this case you have to still wait for an ACH transfer to clear (afaik Gemini let's you buy instantly, but you can't transfer BTC out until your funds clear).

That's not really true.
Coinbase is fine.  Just transfer your coin to your own wallet after you purchase them.
Mostly, those who have had issues with Coinbase were doing something that appeared questionable.  And they were doing it directly from their Coinbase account/wallet.
It's against the law for Coinbase to ignore this type of activity.  Therefore they close the account and return the funds.  No one has lost money because of Coinbase afaik.
It is good how strictly Coinbase applies KYC laws.  It allows them to straddle the fiat/BTC line with less stigma and more reputability.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:55:43
The largest miners will just fill the blocks with spam (at a loss of income), which will raise the blocksize (just a little at a time) and push smaller pools/miners off the network.
Also, larger and larger blocks mean that you and I can no longer verify the network ourselves.  Unless you have some high speed connection that you can dedicate to the network, you will be trusting others to verify for you.
And none of it solves 10 minute settlement times.

And if, in some conspiratorial situation, Core chose *not* to implement a truly intelligent and well-designed upgrade to the network, Core would no longer be the dominant software on the network as developers would leave and users would switch to different nodes.
Do you simply not understand that BU is risky? Riskier than high TX fees.  Riskier than SegWit/LN *not* working.

More (or bigger) busses is seen as a controversial investment amongst many bus companies and their riders.  Especially when that decision may be handed over to bus manufacturers.
Arguments against additional busses include increased running expenses and the complexity of deciding just which bus to use.  Added to that, the roads probably need to be upgraded for bigger buses.
All of it adds up to the very real threat that many small bus companies will be pushed out of the market.   Some safety systems may not work well in less developed areas.
Thus, a few bus companies, opportunely located where busses are manufactured, will control the market and move in lockstep to protect their interests. They will invite government regulation and licensing to prevent any competition gaining a foothold.
Fortunately, some bus engineers came up with a way to pack more passengers into a slightly modified bus.  They reorganized the luggage to below and added some security to make sure everyone gets to their proper destination.
The best part is that the upgrades will work on bigger busses too.  Once the roads are updated, everyone can try to decide on a new bus size.

Is there a metric/formula that gives us 1MB blocks?
What I mean to say is that 1MB just barely works for me, and I probably have very average computer and network.  Larger blocks seem like they would be hard to support.
At 1MB blocks, was my 200KB/sec UL significant to the network?  Useless?

I was* uploading about 200KB/sec with a Core full node, no modifications (DL's were negligible).
Not sure if this was just my UL limit - it wasn't *killing* my internet, but it certainly caused slowdowns.
If we moved to 2/4/8MB blocks, would we see more UL needs?
Or is that already a constant pressure?
I don't think it would be storage or DL bandwidth for me, strictly UL bandwidth.
I imagine it would be the same for other cable modem users (usually a 10-1 DL/UL ratio).
Edit: *Was* because I set some variable in Core to limit MB of uploads per day.

It's an open-source project.  Anyone can write code for it, take that code and use it, or translate it to different programming languages.  Some developers donate time,  some are paid by companies to write code for the Bitcoin network, some work for companies that develop Bitcoin applications.
There are a number of different implementations of the bitcoin software, but primarily people use a version called "Bitcoin Core".
There is a balance of power between miners that generate bitcoins, nodes that validate those bitcoins, and the open market which determines their value.
This keeps any one group from making unchecked changes to the network.

Yeah, I'll pay my share of taxes when the time comes.  I've learned my lesson there.
I'm more curious what the IRS rules would evolve into if bitcoin usage became ubiquitous.
What if my landlord began accepting bitcoin?  Is that cashing out?  What if he trades some of that bitcoin for repairs?  It never really became fiat, but normally those would be taxable events.
More money moves to bitcoin, from both traceable and untraceable sources.  They mix intimately.  Mixer/tumblers become commonplace.  Protocol level anonymity is implemented.  Masked identities are inevitable.  International exchanges outside of IRS jurisdiction.
How long until it's a hopelessly tangled web which can at most suggest a circumstantial connection between a user and a particular transaction?
@_date: 2017-03-24 08:12:09
I don't mean common ground with BU.  I mean common ground at all.
One thing that I have not seen is a clear-cut presentation on how 1MB has become the standard.
If the network can't handle much more than 1MB as is, was this pure luck?  Or a calculation of what the network could eventually handle? As I understand it, the size was dropped from 32MB because of a spam risk.  Was SN just being smart and taking a really good guess at where the network would eventually have problems?
And as far as presenting this concept. I'm talking infographic simple.  Graphs and pictures. Bullet points.  Not a blog post...
Because there is some obvious disconnect here.  The hard and fast of the debate is barely discussed anymore.
It's all conspiracy this, censorship that - plenty from our side/Core side as well.
I know the figures are fuzzy, the statistics gameable and so on.  But something guided us to 1MB, that something should be identifiable and debatable.
To be clear, I am a small block proponent.  I'm just looking for clarity. Scour my history if you wish.

Anyone whoever made a deal with Core should have realized that a few developers cannot represent the entire Core team.  That's just the nature of the organization.
As for your conspiracy concerns, it's quite impressive that you know what is going on the heads of other people.  You even seem to "know" their motivations a year in advance.  Impressive.

No worries.
I have get the feeling people don't really realize the impacts of bumping up blocksize.  There are cringeworthy and disingenuous comparisons to average website sizes and HDD capacity made over and over.  Stuff that even I can recognize is irrelevant.
Maybe in the future you could post some of those stats?  And maybe some details of this centralized network?  I didn't know that was really a thing.
I'm no fan of BU, and certainly don't want to break the network or unduly encourage centralization.  However, having the blocksize set at any one value deserves a method that is determined via math and network statistics.
I'm not saying that is easy or even possible - people will of course attempt to game the statistics that govern the blocksize.
But if we could create an equation with enough counter-checks to manipulation, perhaps there would be less arguments regarding blocksize?
And I don't think this needs to be coded into Bitcoin, this could still be administered by developers.  It could just act as a guide that lets us have *some* common ground.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:26:09
Firstly, You have a hyper-privileged, 1st world assessment of internet speeds and you dismiss $2/day as inexpensive.
Secondly, you assume BU miners won't raise block sizes to crowd out smaller miners.  There is no realistic prediction of how big blocks would get, as we can't separate "spam" from "actual tx".  This would mean massive centralization and thousands of nodes leaving the network.
Right now our cheap little nodes are the only thing keeping $100M miners from running the show.  BU hands the stage and mic to the most cutthroat portion of the Bitcoin network.

If you operate a bank(ish) type business in the US, you have to practice due diligence at preventing fraud.

You don't need to add the transaction fee to the amount you are sending, it will be added for you.
Some wallets let you set the transaction fee - higher fee generally means faster processing.
Yes, you can assume that coins bought from Coinbase will always have the identity registered with Coinbase associated with them.
There are conflicting opinions about using coin mixers/shufflers to anonymize your coins.
Moving them in and out of an anonymous exchange (using multiple wallets and different transaction amounts) would probably be enough to hide your identity - unless you are planning something particularly nefarious.

I think that might be *too* dynamic.
I'm thinking we use basic metrics like block propagation time across the network, and ??? to create a composite metric that we can map to the blocksize for a yearly(?) update.
Edit:  Use those fancy averages too, like medians, and toss out outliers.
Since we already involve humans, the devs would still have a kill switch before any update happens.
Eventually, as the methodology for blocksize increases are increasingly codified, less and less human interaction would need to happen.

My disorganized thoughts:
Segueing smoothly into the subject will be the hardest task.  Here are some related subjects:
1.  Currency issues
2.  Cryptography issues
3.  Corporate/Banking interference with government
Another option: Group Bitcoin in with other risky or zany investment strategies (appealing to their preconceived notions) only to recant and share your personal *success* in dealing with Bitcoin.
Alternatively, you could be upfront.  Explain you *are* enthusiastic about a relatively new technology and ask if they are familiar with "Bitcoin".  Don't be that one-dimensional "Bitcoin" guy, because you probably aren't. 
Remember, it's a game of golf, not a sales pitch.  Don't leave a bad taste in his mouth.  Be subtle in your enthusiasm, confident in your knowledge.
One of Bitcoins most repeated claims is its use in the criminal world, it would silly to not be ready to address this issue.

Convincing someone to accept bitcoins is not a big deal.
The price fluctuations would primarily affect whoever is *holding* the bitcoins.  In this scenario it would be the US side holding bitcoins, ready to send.
The Chinese side could sell them as soon as they receive them, their exposure to volatility is minimal.

Think of it this way.
Bitcoin is a network of computers that conspire to make sure that no one is creating/spending Bitcoin that don't exist or they don't own.
That network is expensive to run because Bitcoin is designed with really difficult encryption.
To pay for the network rewards are given out.  The form of these rewards is bitcoins.  This is where all bitcoin originally comes from.
Anyone can be a part of this network and receive awards.  Be forewarned, you will need expensive equipment and cheap electricity.

Who cares about 50 reddit links about people who had their Coinbase accounts closed?
Where are the 50 links for people who just had their limits increased (like me)?  The 50 links of people who have received satisfactory support (like me)?
Why aren't you rallying against all the other USA exchanges that do the exact same things?
AML/KYC restrictions are imposed by the government NOT Coinbase.  If CB chooses to close an account, what do you care?  It's not like they ran off with someone's money.  They just chose to not do business with them.
And to top it off, you obviously don't live in the USA, where account closures and monitored/delayed transfers happen all the time.
Now, I won't defend our draconian tax laws, but you have to realize that they are a part of life in the USA.
They are some of the most powerful laws in the land.  We catch criminals (actual dangerous violent guys) that have eluded the law by using the tax code against them.
Also, as I know you love to talk about how you live your life in BTC.   Do you know how impossible that would be in the USA?  Detailing tax load on every purchase?  Some may be willing to do it, but most don't understand the laws well enough to file their taxes in this way.

If it is, and you have somehow convinced him that this investment will be the best he has ever made, just stop.  Return the money.
Back to assuming this is a small investment for him.
I would involve your dad as much as possible in the purchase of the coins.  It will help relieve any accusations or guilt if if Bitcoin were to tank.  Besides, he is probably very smart in some aspect of life to be able to offer you this opportunity.  I'd take his advice when possible.
Purchasing it all at once?  You may be able to go to a broker and get a better deal OTC.  I'm sure someone here else has experience with this.
At the very minimum, buy the Bitcoin on a trading platform, not an exchange.  This alone will save you ~$100 in fees.
Only put a few thousand on the exchange at any time, move your BTC somewhere safe after you buy them.  This could be another cool thing to do with your dad.  Backup schemes, multisig rules, etc.

"What is a compromise? It is a work of mutual concession - an agreement in which there are reciprocal stipulations - a work in which, for the sake of peace and concord, one party abates his extreme demands in consideration of an abatement of extreme demands by the other party: it is a measure of mutual concession - a measure of mutual sacrifice."

An ETF is an investment vehicle that will allow traditional investment accounts, like mutual funds, to buy "Bitcoin".  In theory the ETF will have to prove ownership of a large portion of those Bitcoin at any time.
SegWit is a more space efficient way of sending transactions on the Bitcoin network.  It also fixes transaction malleability, which means no one can corrupt a transaction once it is on the network.
Fixing malleability is necessary for implementing the Lightning network, which would be a transaction layer on top of Bitcoin.  The Lightning network should allow for hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

No computer or GPU is powerful enough to mine BTC efficiently.
You have to use ASIC based machines (Application Specific Integrated Circuit - the application is Bitcoin).  Basically machines designed to only mine BTC.
Your machine may be powerful enough to mine other cryptocurrencies though.  You can then exchange them for BTC.
Just be aware that your card will be running full-tilt while mining which will fill your room with fan noise and heat as well as probably reducing the life of your card.

There will only ever be 21 million BTC.
Right now, there are 12.5 new BTC created every 10 minutes as a reward for miners work.
In three years that will drop to 6.25 BTC every 10 minutes.
Every four years the mining reward cuts in half.
Right now we are at ~4% inflation.  In 3 years we will have ~2% inflation.
Eventually, the coins being mined will be insignificant and the inflation will be close to zero.
If no new coins are mined, and the demand stays the same, their value will go up.

So, Core has done nothing but hold back BTC?
Exactly who has been writing the software for the BTC network?  When BU, XT, SW2X, etc. were created, what software did they copy to create their own vision?
How could any form of consensus be achieved if the people who write the software were not invited?
Its scary how suddenly big business decisions (SW2X) are lauded as the best direction for Bitcoin.
If it has so much industry support, I find it impossible to believe there is not a group of developers currently working on Core that support SW2X.

This fund is always at the back of my mind when I see your posts Theymos.
I can never quite realize any particular usage of the coins, but I do like to toss ideas out there.  No one proposes much at all, so I'm just going to go with general ideas.  Maybe some one will be inspired to flesh one out into something coherent.
1.  Donation.  One big one seems like a waste.  Instead donate 1 BTC a month for a year? Pick the charity by creating a blockchain (BTC of course) secured token that represents votes or can be cast as votes or whatever.  Could be self-funding if coin/vote proceeds are enough. Not even sure how that would work...
2.  Canopy/signage with Bitcoin info and resources for events and festivals. Considering this would be for communal use, I don't know how it would get shipped around and stored.  Maybe a donation address is created just for the shipping/restock of materials.
3.  Buy a shit ton of stickers or something like that.  Still needs to be distributed.  Maybe there are companies that will handle that.
4.  This is not an ad, so I don't know if it would count.  Pay for hosted nodes. Or testnet nodes. Or something like that.  Something that supports the network in an agnostic way.
5.  Even better, find receptive public schools that will host a simple node, and donate the machine.
Out of ideas for the moment.  Off to bed.

I've used Abra, it works fine.
It's a Bitcoin wallet that lets you hold your Bitcoin in a (hedged) fiat currency.
Deposit $100 from your bank into Abra and you have $100 in your wallet.  If the BTC price goes up or down, you still have $100 in your wallet.
You can send the $100 as USD to someone else's Abra wallet and they will get $100.  You can send the $100 to another user with a different currency and you will just pay the exchange rate.
You can convert to BTC by "Withdrawing as BTC" to any BTC wallet (or just switch Abra's currency to BTC).
You can find your Abra wallet with their tellers, bitcoin, some banks and Amex.  ACH bank transfers are crazy fast and happen the same day.
My main issue with Abra is that the math that "hedges" everything and makes it all work is completely opaque.
This leads to the question of what would happen to the "$100" in the Abra app if Abra itself went out of business.

Do you think predetermined increases will be responsive enough?

US Dollars can be legally split in to 1,000 units (milles).
In the 1930's, gas used to cost less than 20¢/gallon.  If the price went up 1¢, that was more than a 5% increase in price.
Coupled with accurate fuel pumps, businesses used pricing to compete with each other.
There are also fractional taxes on US fuels.  The federal tax on gasoline is 18.4¢/gallon.
At this point it's mostly marketing.

First off, we can assume it's not your average tollway.
A group of competitive companies administer this tollway.  They all benefit from it operating with the maximum fees that the market will bear.
If the tollway is empty, the toll drops.  If it's full, the tolls go up.  Free market, right?
Now, just about every car is let on to the tollway.  This is good, as there is little to no discrimination.
However, the tollway companies figured out how to build a car that uses almost no gas, carries no cargo and drives around constantly, filling the tollway.
These inexpensive vehicles take up space on the road, forcing everyone (who has real transactions) to pay more to use the tollway.


They are essentially paying a flat fee, and the lowest one at that, just to get in the queue and take up space.


No, they are making revenue for themselves.  And though they probably lose a money in the extreme short-term, overall they drive up tolls creating more income for themselves.


Do you think all companies act rationally?  With long-term stability in mind?  Do you think they all care about the tollway or if it makes them money next year?  They don't.  They care about next quarter (if that).


No, I'm claiming that the structural design of the tollway encourages a destructive use of the tollway.
Legislation will not work here, the free market would be ideal to control this, but a proper framework must be established between traffic and tolls for the free market to show its hand.
The closest economic theory I can find is somewhere between "rent seeking" and "the parable of broken windows".

Well the report said that half the adults own less than $2,222, so the "&lt;" used in the first part of the tweet is correct.
The second part should have a "greater than or equal to" sign (≥).
Without symbols:
The average person in the world today has less than $2,222.  If you owned $2,000 or more worth of Bitcoin in 2013 (and held it), you would be part of the worlds' richest 10% today (if you cashed out).

There's a percentage fee for buying the Bitcoin from a CNY exchange.  Usually around 1-2% over the market price of Bitcoin.
Transferring your coin to a USD exchange will probably cost around $0.10-0.15.  It's not related to the amount you are transferring.
Then there is another percentage fee to convert your BTC to USD.  Generally another 1-2%.
So in fees you are looking at 2-4% as well as $0.15 in transfer fees.
There is also a spread (difference in value) between CNY/BTC and USD/BTC.  This may work against you or for you, but is probably a really small difference (0.1%?)

Purchase Method | Average Fee | Delivery Time | Anonymity
ATM | 10-15% | Instant | High
Credit Card | 3-5% | Instant | Medium
ACH Bank Transfer | 1-2% | 3-5 Days | Low
Trading Platform | 0.0-0.5% | Instant | Low
Bank Wire | Flat fees + Trading fee | 1 Day | Low
**Notes:**  
• This mostly applies to the USA  
• Fees may be priced into the exchange rate or listed separately  
• Delivery time is the time for the ATM/exchange to receive your money  
• Trading platforms have low fees but you must deposit via ACH or Bank wire  
• Bank wires will often have flat fees for sending AND receiving  
• Some ACH transfers can happen the same day  
If you are going for lowest fees, transfer money to a trading platform (GDAX) using ACH Bank transfer.
This will take 3-5 days, so you cannot lock in a price with this method.  You will be able to purchase at a low fee (because GDAX is holding your USD).  
For slightly higher fees you could do an ACH Bank Transfer to an exchange (Coinbase).  Again 3-5 days before you see your bitcoin, but you locked in the price at purchase.  
For even slightly higher fees, you can use your credit card to purchase the bitcoin.  Instant purchase, but you have to pay the hidden 3-5% credit card fee.

Did The IRS Just Validate Bitcoin?  
Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF  
(Pending:COIN) | Seeking Alpha  
By Parke Shall
Whether many people like the means or not, the IRS has basically come out and validated Bitcoin (Pending:COIN). It's not in the method with which many Bitcoin users would have liked, but the IRS working to get the account information of Coinbase users is a sign to us that the government is taking digital currency seriously enough to be concerned about it.
This is a double edged sword. It's terrible news for people that have been transacting money through their Coinbase account in order to try and avoid paying taxes or keep eyes off of what they are doing. It's great news for people that hold Bitcoin in general, as it inadvertently validates the asset as meaningful. If the government is concerned about it, chances are it is making enough of an impact on them for them to notice.
Forbes recently described the situation,


Coinbase in the past has said it is committed to customer privacy and will oppose the government's efforts to obtain its customer account information. That could mean an appeal of the District Court's order, and more delay. But even if the IRS gets its paws on the user data soon, it may not immediately lead to audits. The information will surely be difficult for the government to sort through. Simply sending or receiving bitcoins does not necessarily mean someone owes additional tax, even if large quantities of bitcoins have changed hands. There are still many dots to connect, and it may take the government time to do so.
We are still not sure how the government would be able to regulate Bitcoin, if they wanted to. This IRS move is certainly a step in that direction, but they are only really tackling one major Bitcoin exchange and program. There are an infinite number of these programs out there, but Coinbase is probably the most primarily used one right now. Just as though the US was going to pass regulation on Bitcoin, this tells us one thing and that is that the government finds Bitcoin serious enough to allocate time and resources on it. To us, this is the first step in a road to validation.
We continue to believe that owning Bitcoin here in a small percentage could be a lucrative investment going forward. Here's how a publicly traded Bitcoin trust (OTCQX:GBTC) has performed over the last couple of years,
GBTC Chart
GBTC data by YCharts
For a long time we have argued that one should have exposure to Bitcoin because we do believe that it is a next generation of asset that people will use to hedge. While in the past people may hold gold or silver, which we certainly still encourage them to do, Bitcoin is just another way to have a decentralized asset with a finite amount of supply that could cause it to go up meaningfully over the course of time.
In fact, our last Bitcoin article was written while Bitcoin was around $600 per coin, and we reiterated our contention that it would soon be moving toward $1000 per coin. This weekend, bitcoin trades at about $760 per coin.
We continue to believe that Bitcoin will appreciate in value meaningfully going forward and we continue to have a small percentage of our portfolio allocated to it. There are doomsday scenarios in which bitcoin could appreciate 100 times going forward from here, but we think likely scenarios show Bitcoin doubling or tripling easily over the next few years. The next stop is eclipsing the $1000 mark.
We always point out, and one has to remember, that Bitcoin is only as good as the infrastructure base which is based upon. Meaning that in a truly catastrophic scenario, if infrastructure is to get wiped out or people lose access to the Internet, Bitcoin might as well have not existed in the first place. So, with new opportunity comes new types of risk.
With this said, we continue to allocate a small portion of our portfolio to Bitcoin, which we plan on holding over the course of the long term. This new move from the IRS may be short-term pain for a lot of Bitcoin users, because it could have tax consequences, but over the course of the long term we think the message is simply going to solidify Bitcoin's place as a legitimate financial asset.

So, as far as I understand it, blocks are limited because of the potential to fill them with spam, and any dynamic block-size allocation will be exploited by spammers to keep blocks filled and fees high.
Is there a way the network could differentiate spam from actual transfers?
It would still process the spam transfers (no discrimination) but those transfers wouldn't trigger the dynamic block size change.
Blocks would stay filled, but (hopefully) only "real" transactions would be counted.
I don't know what qualifiers you could use to know if a transaction is spam.  Maybe low value transfers with zero/low fees?

Buy them at an exchange.
Use a bank account transfer to avoid most fees.  Will probably take a few days for the Bitcoin to arrive.
Or use a debit card, you will just have to pay withdrawal fees.
Most credit cards will treat the purchase as a cash advance and you will have significant fees.
Once you have purchased and received the Bitcoin, move them to your own wallet.  Do not store them at the exchange.

There really wouldn't be a need for anything privately controlled if the technology is capable and the blockchain honest.  Do they even have "control" over their current setup?  Are bank transfer rules privately controlled?

Just to clarify, Coinbase is an exchange where you can wire dollars or use a credit card to purchase bitcoins.
Legally, you own these bitcoins, but the "bank" is holding them.  Because exchanges are new and relatively untested, leaving your Bitcoin in their hands is considered risky by many.
There is also no real need for a bank to hold Bitcoin.  The whole point is that you can be your own bank with a currency that's sovereign unto itself.
Once you transfer the coins to your wallet (mycelium for example), you and you alone control them.

Tx fee is mostly based on the number of inputs you received.
If you have a bunch of small transactions to your wallet, an output your wallet creates will be large and cost you more.
The best analogy I have seen is to imagine your job paid you 0.1BTC a day.  When you go to pay your landlord 1BTC in rent, your transaction is actually 10 small transactions.

I had a idea for using the advertising fund to purchase simple node servers and donate them to high school computer classes around the world.
Each setup would cost about $100.  I think there are around 12 bitcoin in the fund.  That means ~100 servers, maybe more with some volume discounts/donations/etc.
We would need to create a list of teachers that are interested and willing to take this on.  Creating that list, and satisfying the powers that be will probably be the most difficult aspect.
Divvying out he servers is another hurdle.  One server per country?  Or per capita somehow? Factor in geographical, political, and technical details?
But I'm a slacker, so it was just an idea.

Copay is okay, but I would really recommend bread instead.
Gemini (and Coinbase's GDAX) are true exchanges, setup to allow trading as fast as you like.  If you are not familiar with day trading, don't do it.  You will lose money.  That being said, they have the absolute lowest fees (less than 0.5%), but you will need to send them the money first, once they get it THEN it's available for buying BTC.
Coinbase, Abra, and Glidera are essentially BTC stores.  They are not setup for trading and their fees are 1-2% for banks/credit unions.
If you are completely sold on the idea of BTC and want a good entry price, buy on a big dip like we had last weekend - any dip over 10%?  Otherwise I would just buy what you can afford when you can afford it.

If you transferred on a Friday afternoon, it's entirely possible your transfer didn't initiate until the following Monday.  
Next comes the (3 to) 5 day ACH transfer, meaning your money doesn't arrive until Friday.  
Now you just wait until Monday morning for your balance to be posted in the Coinbase system, and a few more hours to get you your BTC.
So, 10 days is entirely possible - and that doesn't include any bank freezes/reporting if you are transferring $2,000 or more....

ACH bank transfers in the US take 3-5 business days on average, often starting the day after you initiate the transfer and not being posted until the day after final confirmation.
The fastest ACH to BTC I have seen is Abra.  If your banks supports same day ACH and you start early in the day, you can have your BTC by the next morning (sometimes even earlier).

Their are plenty of competent phone wallets (if your phone is not rooted/jailbroken).
I’d look into Breadwallet and Samourai (Android only).
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:46:52
I have used Coinbase, Abra, Uphold and Glidera (aka Kraken Direct).  
I'm mostly a holder, so while fast ACH is nice, slow delivery times don't matter to me.
I generally use Glidera because it gets delivered directly to my wallet (Airbitz or bread).  Still, the ACH transfer is slow and the conversion rate is set at the time of purchase (like Coinbase).
Abra is a multicurrency wallet that has fast ACH times but somewhat low limits (they keep raising them though).  Personally, I wouldn't like to keep any sizable amount on Abra.
Uphold is like Abra but with slow ACH transfers. However, they will let you withdraw up to 10K a day, which is a nice exit option if needed.
By the way, for larger purchases that have to complete quickly, check for exchanges that accept wire deposits (GDAX, Gemini, etc).  You will pay ~$50 in wire fees, but the transfer is almost immediate.  This is also a way to avoid paying 1-2% more than the spot rate (by placing a buy order instead of just buying).
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:24:00
The fees are ridiculous precisely because people are 
willing to pay the ridiculous fees.
Complain to Coinbase about how they set their fees.  They are overpaying to ensure that their customers get their coins quickly.  There should be options for custom fees and slower delivery.
But I sent $1,000 last night at the height of mempool craziness and it cost me $6 to get in the first block.
So, Coinbase is just being dumb or they are in cahoots with some miners.

A note about heat in space - cooling electronics is not easy because there is no air to carry the heat away.
They use radiators that reject heat through infrared radiation.  Wikipedia says they radiate between 100-350w of energy per square meter.
An AntminerS9 uses 1350w of power and virtually all of that would become heat. That means each miner would need a 6’x6’ radiator panel to reject the heat.

Ransom is almost always used for situations that involve humans and the term was created to describe these situations.
Both extortion and blackmail (a subset of extortion) deal directly with the theft of material items.  To split hairs over digital copies is irrelevant, the issue is who holds the confidential information, even if it's held in multiple hands.
In blackmail, "the extortionist threatens to reveal information about a victim or their family members that is potentially embarrassing, socially damaging, or incriminating unless a demand for money, property, or services is met."
I think that because the target was a *Hollywood* hotel, the implication is that there will be compromising celebrity information that could be released.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:29:27
Well, they don't list the fees, but you certainly don't get 100% of spot price when you withdraw via BTC.
I.e. the fee is built into the exchange price.
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:23:53
Without using a payment service, your time should be as short as 10 minutes to an hour - with some caveats.
Basically the language of the deal needs to be precise to protect both of your interests.  A common exchange rate should be used.  The time of transaction should be synchronized.
Assuming they need to acquire bitcoin, it may take 3-7 days for them to purchase their BTC (and a X% fee).  At least that's how it is in the US.
So right there is a few days worth of fluctuation in price.  They should probably purchase an excess to be ready if the value went down.  You can't/don't want to hbe responsible for their banking setup or lack thereof.
Next, they need to send you the BTC.  This should take a maximum of 10-20 minutes if the proper fees are paid.  They should pay maximum fees to ensure prompt confirmation.
The BTC is now in your wallet.  You need to send it to an exchange at this point.  Another 10-20 minutes and another exchange fee.
Alternatively, you could send it directly to your exchange address.  This will save you the previous steps time and cost.
Finally, you need to convert your BTC to fiat.  For larger values you should definitely use a low fee trading platform like GDAX or Gemini where the rate will be .15% or less.
This happens instantaneously and the fiat is now yours (snicker).  It may take a few days to transfer to your business account but that would occur in fiat, so no exchange rate exposure.
If you could agree online/phone on an exchange rate, and they have the BTC in their possession, the whole exchange shouldn't take more than an hour or two at worst.
I would contact the exchange and make them aware that you wish to do a large exchange so that you can clear up any discrepancies ahead of time.
If anyone has the price volatility exposure, it's the Chinese guys who have to hold the BTC until the transaction is done.
Also, note the large discrepancy between Chinese exchange prices and US prices.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:40:09
1.  What country are you in?
2.  Will you use cash, a credit card or a bank account to purchase your BTC?
3.  Where will you send/store the bitcoin?
I'd suggest using a bank account to buy your BTC.  It will have the lowest fees.  But it will have the most user verification.  Get ready to give up all your information, just as though you were setting up a new bank account.
Exchange options (at least in the US) include Coinbase, Glidera, Abra, and Uphold (among others).
Let's pretend you buy from Coinbase.  You setup an account with them and probably have to verify your bank account with them.  Once verified, you make your $1,500 BTC purchase.  The price is locked in at the moment you hit "buy". 
The money will quickly leave your bank account and then will be in transfer for 3-5 business days.  When it arrives at Coinbase your **Coinbase Wallet** will show your BTC balance.
But BTC was created so that **YOU** control your wealth.  You don't leave it sitting on Coinbase because you don't control them there.
So, the last step is to send the BTC to your own wallet.
If your phone is not rooted/jailbroken you can add a wallet like "bread" (or Samourai, airbitz, green address) from the app store.  Be sure to check that it's an official and well-known wallet.
You can also print a paper wallet or get a hardware wallet as you get more savvy.
Maybe don't buy all $1500 at once... maybe $500 a week?
Fees are high right now, especially for moving your BTC off an exchange.  Minimize the number of transactions you make.

It's the easiest KYC/AML that I have experienced with a US based fiat exchange using ACH transfers.
@_date: 2017-04-14 06:36:27
What is "incredibly slow"?
ACH bank transfers in the US are notoriously slow (3-5 days) and will get held up for mandatory AML reviews depending on the amount.
Edit:  You don't need to be a teller.
You just need to have a bank account that can link to Abra (many currencies/banks supported).
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:23:18
I have.  Set your Abra wallet to dollars.  Transfer from your bank account to your Abra wallet.  Withdraw from Abra wallet as Bitcoin.
ACH transfer was relatively quick compared to Coinbase/Glidera, about 2-3 days.
Exchange rate seems to be about 1.5% but it's built into the price.  You also pay the BTC transaction fee when you withdraw.

I wouldn't say that CB is unorganized.  They are just a large company in a relatively new market.  All we see on this subreddit are the complaints.  I can't even imagine the "shill" complaints if someone just posted some praise of CB - and my interactions with them were always praiseworthy.
I did see wildly different deposit times with them,  but they were all within normal timeframes.  Same as Circle was.
A 9 day transfer is odd - was it over $2000?  The extra AML checks begin around there.
Kraken I have not tried, and Glidera I am still trying (Kraken Direct, same company now).

Off topic but if you need to just withdraw money from a regular ATM, most will not work.
Only the ATM's at 7-11 worked for me.  Luckily 7-11's are everywhere.  Exchange rate was the international standard.  Your bank fees for international withdrawals will obviously apply, mine was $3.
Forex is a complete ripoff, avoid at all costs.
If you don't have yen when you arrive, the forex is the only place to get money in the subway (that I found), and the subway machines do not accept credit cards.  If needed, change the minimum amount you need to get out of the station.
Also, not sure what your plan for Internet access is while you are there but I found an amazing solution.  I rented a wifi hotspot.  Unlimited 4G data for about $3 a day.

@_date: 2017-04-14 05:33:37
I have used Abra in the US.
You fund the Abra app using ACH transfer (2-3 days).  No fees.  $100 out of your bank account is $100 in your Abra app.
To convert to BTC you "withdraw" from the Abra app using Bitcoin.  You can choose the amount to withdraw and the fee is about 1.5% or so.  You withdraw to your own BTC wallet and the transaction fee is deducted from your BTC total.
**Important** - if you set your Abra wallet currency to "Bitcoin", any funds you transfer to the app will be converted to bitcoin *when they actually transfer to the app*, i.e. you won't be able to precisely choose when that happens.
P.S. - I'd love someone to check my fee estimate.

Imagine universities, banks, internet providers, major corporations, governments, law offices, etc. all running some standard, open-source blockchain software.  Not to mention current servers nodes being repurposed. Tacking on another blockchain project (Bitcoin) would be easy.
Could mining and the blockchain be split?  Mining farms continue mining and just publish to the blockchain?
I bring this up because it seems like either Bitcoins blockchain will become the HTML of distributed ledgers or something else will.
If something else becomes the ubiquitous distributed ledger, I think Bitcoins self-serving node network might be hard to justify.

Literally the only thing that a credit card offers to me over bitcoin (in an online transaction) is the ability to reverse charges on a purchase that did not go as planned.  The miles, insurance, etc. are a pittance, hard to collect on, and generally add very little value in my mind.
Maybe I've just been lucky, but no merchant has *ever* defrauded me.  Like ever.  At all.  Where are people buying from that this an issue?
However, my CC info has been stolen.  Multiple times.  So which do I worry more about?

They are the same thing, you can setup a bank account from your house too.
It's KYC regulations (Know Your Customer). They will want your address and ID at a minimum.
Coinbase does tend to be more strict on KYC/AML than your average bank.
Getting BTC is not always as easy as visiting Coinbase.
I live in Hawaii and Coinbase had to pull out of here because of new regulations.  Those same regulations will probably keep Gemini out indefinitely.  Potential strike one.
Kraken/Glidera was my next option.  Luckily they work with my bank, they have a shortlist of supported banks.  Potential strike two.
Getting approval from them was like pulling teeth.  After sending my info, pics of me holding my info, etc, they claimed my SS# didn't match their records and requested a bank statement and a copy of my SS card.  I'm paperless with my banks.  A utility bill?  I'm paperless with my bills. Sent them a pay stub that I got my work to print out (paperless there too) and they finally approved me.  Apparently their system decided to like my SS# because they never asked for that.
Potential strike three.
And I'm fairly savvy at this shit.  Take a new user through this process and their eyes gloss over and fear sets in.

Where did you get the idea that BTC is against money printing?  The Bitcoin network "prints" new coins every 10 minutes.
Of course the catch is that BTC has a fixed amount of money to print and is controlled by math.
~16 out of 21 Million coins have been mined.  If your coin isn't one of those 16 million, it's not a Bitcoin.
If you create/fork a new coin, it isn't Bitcoin.  A million altcoins could be spun off from Bitcoin and there would still only be one Bitcoin.
Also, a new coin does not create wealth.  Either it will take value from the Bitcoin network or new money will flow into the new coin.  Alternatively a fork may release stored/hidden/repressed value within a coin, allowing the sum value of the two coins to be greater than the original unforked coin.
Edit:  What does my original statement have to do with "money printing"?

Use your US bank account.
ACH transfer from PayPal to your Bank - 5-7 days generally.
Use a service like Coinbase or Glidera.  You will be paying 1.5-2% over the going rate.  Your price will be locked in when you buy.
Or use GDAX.  ACH transfer again, wait another 5-7 days and then exchange at a 0.5% or less fee.‪

You should never keep your BTC on an exchange unless you are planning to exchange them.

I'm in Hawaii and it's not easy to buy with a bank account.  No Coinbase/GDAX, no Gemini.  It's basically Glidera, old-school wire your money to some exchange, or pay crazy high fees via CC/ATM/localbitcoin.
Suppose you find a service that will sell you some BTC.  After figuring out 2FA for the first time, you go through the ridiculous KYC requirements, giving your credentials to a company you have likely never heard of before.
Eventually you get to the point of actually typing in the amount you want to buy.  $5,000.  Nope.  Not enough verification/over your daily buy limit/etc.

Of course I am, that's what I buy.  In any case we are really arguing the definition of efficiency.  You are taking into account an entire system, which holds little bearing on what I spend.  I am taking into account the things I would actually pay for.
I understand their are efficiency losses converting NG to electricity to heat.  High efficiency plants only get about 35-50% efficiency.  Transmission losses average 6.5% in the US.
However, statement is STILL correct.  For every watt you give an electrical water you get nearly 100% of it as heat.  For every joule you give a gas heater you get maybe 90% of it's energy as heat.
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:05:48
He's not wrong though.  Electric space heaters are 100% efficient at generating heat.  Even the light from the LED power light eventually turns into heat.  Inefficiency in a closed-system heating element is a non-issue.  Unless your heater is producing radiant energy that escapes the house (RF, Sound waves, etc.) everything will be turned into heat.
Natural gas is less efficient at heating (you lose heat through the exhaust flue) but is FAR cheaper per BTU.
It has less to do with conversion losses and more to do with conversion costs.
@_date: 2015-04-14 03:14:31
Actually it can be extremely efficient, just costly.
Your average tank based electric water heater is nearly 100% efficient, gas usually maxes out at 88%.  Though, if you count in power plant and transfer losses its probably close to a wash.
None of this changes the fact that a joule of electricity is FAR more expensive than a joule of natural gas.

A very narrow slice Americans were actually exposed too the metric system.
In the late seventies/early eighties there was a push to switch to the metric system in the US.  Packaging received metric labeling and we were taught metric concepts in school as well.
I'm no math or engineering wizard, but I can easily calculate the weight of a given volume of water and how much energy it would take to raise it 1 degree Celsius or lift it 1 meter.
And thats because of the metric system.
I have no idea how volume equates to gallons.  I *do* know roughly how much a gallon of water weighs because of rote memorization.  I have zero idea how many BTU's or horsepower(LOL) it would take to raise a gallon of water 1 degree (C or F).
I would like to note that it's somewhat unfair to hate on "Americans."  I would hesitate to generalize Germans or Italians, much less group them into "Europe" and assume they have one opinion or that the actions of their country accurately reflect the opinions of *all* of their people.  
"America" describes nearly an entire continent. 50 states, many larger than whole European countries. Filled with the most diverse population on earth.  It pains me to think that you believe there is no average person here that would understand you.
I think you may have also missed the opportunity to make this other guy realize he probably already deals with metric and SI units frequently.  Who doesn't know *milli*liters?  C'mon there's like 351(?) in 12 ounces, it's written on every soda can here. Or *mega*bytes? *Kilo*meters?
I will concede that it pains me as well that *every* average person here doesn't understand basic metric concepts.  And on that issue, America as a whole has failed.
But, I am not sure why the US would have a disproportionate influence on Bitcoin naming anyways - isn't a decentralized global currency (or whatever) designed by a Japanese (was he really Japanese?) guy?
But, if bit is here to stay, in my opinion "bit" sounds like the smallest portion of something without dividing further.  Without knowing anything about Bitcoin, I would think a *bit* of one Bitcoin is the the last digit after the decimal point - .00000001.
1 Bitcoin = 100 Megabits (Mbit)
Since data rates are also measured in megabits (Mb), it should be written as Mbit.
I sure hope I did the math right.

State-run lotteries are almost always used to fund social programs.  Sounds great, except the lottery funds are not used as a *bonus* to traditional funding.  Time and time again they become an enabler for *cutting* regular budget appropriations.
Also, lotteries disproportionately affect those with a poor understanding of personal finance and statistics.  The disenfranchised and the gambling addicted, are sold a false story of social benefit.
Lotteries get a bad rap because our government shouldn't be profiting from an addictive game of chance.  Especially when the real outcome is poorly funded social programs paid for by the very people who can least afford the "tax".

You could easily have people send BTC to a Coinbase wallet and immediately send that to a bank account for 1.5%.  Circle is a bit cheaper and you could do it for even less with other methods.
Something to display a QR code and training the payment desk to use it would be your biggest overhead.
Honestly, 5% is far more than average CC fees.  Usually they are 2-3% maximum, but maybe they are experiencing charge-backs or something else.

Theaters are dirty, overpriced, noisy and run on their own schedule.  If they became the only option (no DVDs, no DL's) then piracy would *skyrocket*.
The key to ending piracy is easy, affordable access.  Look at iTunes, which has been a complete success despite piracy.

You may think it's easier, but I have to explain breadwallet and its arbitrary choice of decimals to every person.  Every time.  As in, I don't like to recommend it is as a wallet for this one reason.
The real problem here is not the decimals.  The real issue is your insistence that this is how people want to use Bitcoin.
How hard is it to offer the *option* to use other denominations?  Aren't you tired of defending this (lack of) choice?
As far as I have seen, this one issue is the most often criticized aspect of breadwallet.

I don't know anything about mining but I poked around and came up with $207-$1062.
An Antminer s7 should mine 1BTC worth in a little under 3 months (under the new difficulty).  It consumes 1.2kW of electricity.  Three months is 2,160 hours.
Multiply 2,160 hours times 1.2kW times the cost of electricity in kWh.
Electricity costs vary widely per kilowatt hour.  Country-wide averages are in the range of 8¢ to 41¢, but can be much higher or lower.  For example, my residential rate is 42¢ - no mining for me.
Bear in mind, this is not including the costs of the miner itself ($850), Internet, air conditioning (it's a 1200w heater), your time, etc.

4 Reasons To Buy Bitcoin Now - Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF (Pending:COIN) | Seeking Alpha
Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of bitcoin.
- Reddit definition of bitcoin
For a more comprehensive overview of what bitcoin is, its Wikipedia page is a great resource.
Bitcoin represents a tiny part of my portfolio but I'm intending to build the size of the stake a little bit. In my view, it is a suitable minor component of the left side (safe side) of The Black Swan Portfolio. Please note: Bitcoin is extremely volatile.
There are a few things coming together why I'm writing it up now:
1) We are getting ever closer to a bitcoin ETF
The SEC is gathering input on the Winklevoss Brothers initiative (Pending:COIN) and it looks like some kinks could use working out this appear doable. Even if they fail, I suspect we are going to witness an ETF or fund getting launched at some point. Here's the latest SEC letter.
2) Funds are launching and there is great demand
HK, run by the FRMO Corp. (OTCPK:FRMO) team and a Black Swan Portfolio holding, started a fund for its clients (emphasis mine) and there was a lot of interest:
In 2016, Horizon Kinetics also established a fund that invests in bitcoin. Bitcoin is an example of a cryptocurrency. This asset class will be discussed more fully in the section pertaining to our investment in Digital Currency Group. This asset class did not exist several years ago; it is entirely new. The fund established an investment maximum of $50,000 per client. We are not aware of any other firm that so constrains client contributions. However, we believe it is the easiest and most obvious way to control risk. We simply limit the amount of money that can possibly be lost to an amount that is tolerable. Investment firms often complain about the short-term focus of clients. The short-term focus is more understandable if the investment in failure mode could quite negatively impact their lives. In any case, we rapidly sold essentially every available slot in the fund.
I've learned from the company they have two funds that are open to accredited investors only and limit investments to $50,000 for now.
3) Funds have started buying in
Ark Invest, an investment firm, read their white paper on bitcoins, holds bitcoin through the GBTC trust. It holds GBTC in its Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). Horizon Kinetics also invests in GBTC though its Kinetics Internet Fund No Load (WWWFX), Kinetics Paradigm Fund No Load (WWNPX) and Kinetics Market Opportunities (KMKAX). When fund buying starts ramping up this can have a profound effect on the valuation of bitcoin because 1) On a global basis there's over $100 trillion in assets under management. Imagine only a 1/10th of 1% getting moved into bitcoin. 2) Institutions holding for diversification or long-term investment purposes may have much steadier hands than the current bitcoin traders, which could help stabilize bitcoin's volatility, which would in turn make it more attractive to other investors and retailers.
4) Family offices are buying in
Perhaps by nature more interested in wealth preservation, family offices appear to be acquiring bitcoin. Murray Stahl on the FRMO Corp. Q3 earnings call:
Believe it or not, bitcoin is making progress. There are family offices, quite a few of them actually, that are buying bitcoin. The issues about safe custody and storage are technological problems that are being worked out.
5) Optionality
The downside is admittedly quite large with bitcoin. It is conceivable it becomes worthless and it has been proclaimed dead no less than 112 times. The last time in Newsweek October 12th.
The upside is also large. Bitcoin is already 10x larger than Linden Coin (of the game Second Life) at its peak. What can bitcoin become? Could it become as important as gold? Can it replace all money? I don't know but the visualization made by the money project in 2015 gives an idea of the relative size of the bitcoin "market cap" compared to other assets:
Source: The money project
My allocation is less than 1% and I prefer a basket of cryptocurrencies to any particular cryptocurrency, but I'll talk about those in a future article. The ultimate value of some of these coins is very large and without any cap and therefore I prefer to diversify between them. Read my prior Bitcoin articles: 6 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Invest In Bitcoin and 5 Reasons To Buy Bitcoin.
Good places to acquire Bitcoin and Ethereum are:
Coinbase (U.S.-based, if you use this link and buy $100 worth we both get $10 bitcoin free)
Kraken (U.S.-based, you can use this alternative)
I use the above-mentioned Coinbase for a cryptowallet. It is very user-friendly. No advanced tech knowledge required. In addition, you can also hold Ethereum which I find convenient.

Floppy wasn't obsolete?
It had been obsolete since far before Apple removed them.  Hell, when I was a kid ('88ish), I had games that took nearly 20 floppies to install (nearly my whole HDD).  Everyone knew it was dead, but it was only used it because of a lack of (write-capable) alternatives.  And PC's needed them to boot.
Anyways, thanks for the Apple history lesson?
Again, completely irrelevant to the situation at hand.
Let's review how irrelevant:
1.  Apple removed a choice.  Breadwallet refuses to implement a choice.
2.  One is (and was) a multi-billion dollar company.  One is a non-revenue generating open source project.
3.  Floppies were (or would be) considered obsolete.  BTC is going to be a part of Bitcoin forever, no matter if we use bits or not.
Comparing these two is like comparing a local burger joint to McDonald's.  With the local burger joint refusing to serve a type beef and McDonald's stopping the sale of outrageously hot coffee.
Just two entirely different things.

Community owned things can work just fine.  I've ridden yellow bikes, they were donated and repaired by the community.  I've lived in towns where they had bought agricultural equipment that was available for all to use.
Even in your dystopian nightmare, a refundable deposit to have the device shipped to an event should cover most of the risk.

Depending where you buy and how comfortable you are leaving your Bitcoin on exchange for a few weeks, you could let your $10 purchases stack up until the transaction fee is less significant.

Keeping your coins on Coinbase is somewhat anathema to the Bitcoin purist.
The idea of BTC is peer to peer money.  You don't need Coinbase once you have your Bitcoin, that's the point.
So many people will tell you to put your Bitcoin into a wallet where only you control the keys.
If all you plan to do is long-term store them (6 months+ ?) you could put them on a paper wallet and hide/store/safekeep that paper.
If you want them a little more liquid, you could keep them on a (un-rooted, non-jailbroken, etc) smartphone app.
If you want something more secure than your phone then you can look at a hardware wallet.

Well, what if someone controlled a significant portion of hashrate (alone or miners colluded)?  Say about 33%.
And what if they recover a significant portion of the fees?  Again about 33% of them.
And what if you were paying the lowest accepted fee per transaction? Not 300 sat/byte at all.
I'm thinking that "$200M" gets small real fast, and is more than offset by the increased fees paid by actual users who need timely confirmations.
And their goal wasn't SegWit2X.  It was a power grab for control of the reference client.

You don't need a bitcoin account to receive bitcoin.  You just need a wallet.  The simplest wallets are the ones use your secure smartphone to hold the bitcoin.  Get one of the following apps; airbitz, mycelium or bread.  There are others but any of those should work.
Once you have a wallet you can receive bitcoin by providing your wallets address (your wallet will automatically create a new receive address every time you need one).  If you decide to hold onto some bitcoin, keep some in this wallet.
To turn the (glorious) bitcoin into (evil fiat) cash, you will need to use an online exchange.  Try Coinbase, Circle, or Kraken.  These will require ID/info and your bank account number.  Expect 3-5 business days for the bitcoin to become cash in your bank account.
I suppose you could setup an account at PayPal as your "bank", but there is no real advantage.
An alternative would be to fund a "bitcoin" credit card.  These can have high fees, odd exchange policies, etc.  Read the fine print to make sure it will work for you.

Also, as a US citizen, it would be stupid to trust an exchange in another country.
Kraken isn't available in my state, they serve 37 out 50.
Poloniex sells BTC?  I thought they just did trading/crypto-exchanges.  Didn't they lose 12.5% of their assets to a hack and then passed the costs onto their customers in 2014?

Set up as many different buy accounts as you can?  Multiple exchanges, multiple people?  Like 5 people.
You would need to do everything on credit cards, which generally means anywhere from 3-7% premium.
If you have multiple credit cards on the same name you may be able to buy your daily max of BTC from each one.

They track because they know they are under a microscope.
It's required of all banks.  Any exchange that gets as large as Coinbase will have to comply with the KYC/AML laws for all the countries it operates in.
Add to that, exchanges that don't take information will always be at more risk of legal prosecution from their host countries, which endangers any clients with money in transfer.
Credit/debit card purchases have stupid fees.  Do you expect everyone to use the 1 BTC limit mess that is bitsquare?  Localbitcoins?

I never explained account closers because you never asked me to explain account closure.
First, you said I shouldn't trust Coinbase, I should trust XYZ.  
I asked "Why trust them over Coinbase?" and gave reasons why I don't.
You didn't answer, but deflected to a question of "why not transfer to a private wallet, they're all the same in that case."
I responded how they weren't the same and again gave my reasons.
And again you deflected, this time asking me to explain account closures.
You still have not explained or expounded on your aversion to Coinbase.  We could have discussed that, but instead I got a string of loaded questions from you.  When the answers didn't satisfy you, you went on to another.

Valid point.  And I totally sympathize with the desire to not fund raise any more.
As far as making a tangible difference, maybe we choose smaller charities?  I don't think many would have anything but praise for a ~$1200 donation.
We could think strategically and choose charities that would have a high reciprocal value for advertising Bitcoin.
Instead of fund raising, maybe just donate 1 full Bitcoin to each charity (plus encourage the community to donate).
We (as a community) handle the "press release" aspect.  Twelve quick pre-written articles that outline the year of giving, a highlight on that months charity, and a blurb about how Bitcoin can affect that charity.  They get sent out to all the leading bitcoin rags and web/podcasts.

Just an idea guy.
Whoever collected the BTC should be in charge of this, they obviously have the skills to collect it.
But I suppose we could just start here, at least some framework stuff.
1.  Start Jan 1st, 2017.  Donation match is made on the last day of each month, matching the amount of Bitcoin the charity has received that month.  The amount to be matched is checked at 11:50 GMT.
2.  Maybe this should be in a Google doc.

Maybe I realize the futility of fighting a rational battle against an irrational behemoth?  Maybe in the mean time I would just like to acquire some bitcoin and not fight some pointless battle.


A "normal" transaction between two accounts can still raise flags.  I just transferred $3500 between two bank accounts and they only moved $200, putting $3,300 on hold "for review".

They are essentially required to kiss ass.
Beyond KYC/AML laws they are required to comply with Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).
*-from Wikipedia*


Basically it's up to Coinbase to decide how far they go.  If *you* were acting as a completely legitimate bitcoin exchange, what standards would you follow?  Would you *just barely* comply?  Risk fines and a black clouds over a multi-million dollar enterprise?
No, you would follow the letter of the law to the T and beyond.  Thus the law requires judgment calls that err on the conservative/aggressive side of enforcement.

You still never named an advantage.
Any purchase involves risk.  When I purchase bitcoin, it generally sits on the exchange for short time.  I have exposed my credentials.  I choose to minimize this risk by purchasing from a US-based company who has only the most minor of "scandals" associated with it.
Oh no, Coinbase froze an account! Oh no, I can't trade on GDX due to a minor tech issue!  What other evil things have they done?  Sided with the "wrong" side in the bitcoin battle?  Wrote a stinging letter about bitcoin and Ethereum?
Who cares?  These aren't issues that I have encountered, nor would they concern me should I encounter them.
Purchasing BTC in the US from a US-based business is going to require an ID, address, and contact info.  That's just how it's going to be if they want to be legal for ACH transfers.
And any business complying with KYC/AML is going to watch your transactions as they leave.  They have to do this with certain amounts and destinations.  If not, they can be fined.
To be honest, it's the companies that *don't* require this info that are at the biggest risk of being shutdown or fined.
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:22:15
Depends how you buy on Coinbase.
ACH bank transfer is 1.5%

They are going to charge you more for the Bitcoin when you use a credit card.
Either it will be an additional fee or built into the conversion rate.
It will be about 3-5% depending on the exchange.
You could link a bank account and get a 1.5% rate.  Your purchase price is locked in at the time of purchase, but you have to wait 5 days for the transaction to clear and the BTC to show up in your account.
You could get a 0.15% rate if you use their GDAX trading platform, but you have to wait the 5 days and then do the trade at the then current rate.

\is correct.
I'd like to add that the fee is not based on the amount of bitcoin you are transferring.  It is based on the size of the transaction in bytes.  This has bad implications for very small transfers with many in/out transactions.  Otherwise it's very inexpensive.
Here is a page that details the costs:
With the most relevant point being:


For the median transaction size of 257 bytes, this results in a fee of 15,420 satoshis (0.09$).
A satoshi is one-millionth of a whole bitcoin.  It is the smallest denomination of bitcoin.

That is the question.  All I can say is that it works currently.  Would I keep more than I'm willing to lose on the app?  Nope.

You are right that it is easy to spin up a bunch of nodes.  You can run whatever the hell you want.
You won't be changing anything unless your nodes are "important".  Now that word is in quotations because it's a nebulous concept that includes many aspects of the Bitcoin network, but I would define it broadly as any node involved in significant, widespread economic activities.
You could look at Coinbase and say that's an important node.  Or trading platforms like Poloniex or Bitfinex.  Localbitcoins.  Gambling sites.  Anywhere there is economic activity.
The goal of BIP149 is to get a large portion of these nodes either choose on their own or respond to their users requests to require SegWit formatted blocks.

They do, but Abra's list is growing fast.

It remains stable, not sure exactly how.

In the unlikely event of a hard fork:
Don't move coins until it is clear (to you) that one coin or the other is the "winner". 
Then split your coins (through some currently unspecified manner), and sell the "loser" coins for more winner coins.
Or keep both coins - either by splitting into two wallets or by never moving them post hard fork (until you are ready to split them).

Is that particular transaction in the list of transactions for your wallet?
There should be a button or link that says something like "View this transaction on the blockchain" or "Advanced".
This should take you to a webpage with all the details about your transaction, including the transaction ID.

What values are you using to get those numbers?

No scam on Abra as far as I have seen.  I used to it to convert about $450 to BTC.
The KYC/AML is minimal and the ACH transfers are **very** fast.
Bill Barhydt is the CEO and he responds directly on Twitter.  He even tipped me $5 (using Abra) for a minor bug report.  I doubt he would attach his name to a scam.

GDAX, which is run by Coinbase will give you better rates.

What is this financial privacy you speak of?
I already bank at three traditional banks.  I have my whole adult life.  I don't agree with all the KYC/AML laws, but they are a fact of life.  That BTC is put under the same scrutiny is a testament to its functionality.
I know you like to tout that you are paid in BTC.  Bully for you.  In the rest of the world you get a check or a direct deposit.  If you work at XYZ corporation, that will not change anytime soon.
And as far as I know, a bank to bank transfer in bitsquare will still raise flags.  It would just not be Coinbase's flags, rather your own banks.
So, for the vast majority of us, buying BTC through Coinbase is no different from what we are already required to do.  In addition, as a US citizen I have a little more security knowing which rules of law apply to Coinbase.

Over two years of weekly purchases from them, I have never had an issue.
Always transfer to my own wallet.

Is the person in Nigeria familiar with Bitcoin?  Just send them Bitcoin.
If not, maybe something with this company?
Of course there is always localbitcoins.com
I found two exchanges that work with Nigerian banks - Nairaex and Bitssa.
Also, Bitcoin may or may not be the cheap way to do this.  Do the math and make sure you are paying the lowest fees possible.

Automated weekly buys.

He's spot on.  There are a few new competitors to Bitmain already.  They will grow and multiply.
The next chip revolution will be a move away from silicon after a ~10nm wall.
Or "quantum" computing.

Maybe I should ask them too, lol.
