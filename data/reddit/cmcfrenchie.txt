Well back then without all of the publicity this reddit was populated mainly by people truly invested in bitcoin, now that everyone and their mother knows about it and is scouring the internet for info on it, of course you’re going to attract a less than desirable crowd

Nothing at all, give up now and sell before you lose all of your money!!!!!!!!!!!! Please take your weak hands somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:44:06
That in itself, was a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:15
Too many weak hands like this are the reason for these dips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:56
Maybe this will teach you to not be so irresponsible and throw all of your money into something you clearly know nothing about.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:07:55
Maybe the boss paid for the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:11:07
Because they are so uncommon and not in the mainstream that they can get away with it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:59:36
Best advice is to treat this money as if you’ve already lost it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:25:16
Hey guys! What can we do to convince you to give us all of your bitcoin for nothing in return?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:13:44
Bitcoin is currently down $3000 from its ATH that was set two days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:15:38
I appreciate the large dips because they get rid of weaker branches on the tree, hopefully to provide a stronger foundation for later on. The motto has always been to HODL as it’s always paid out in the end, so can’t say I feel remotely bad for anyone who quits at the first sign of trouble.

Yeah I stupidly used a bitcoin atm once and it said the price was like 45k usd or some crazy amount on my receipt when the price was actually around 10k (even the machine when I was using it had the right price). Not only that but it took a $59 fee too. Another hard lesson learned to avoid those machines
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:03:47
I wish more people would panic and sell, I missed my chance to buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:39:55
The high transaction fees and long wait times with all of these fledgling businesses. 
Also the fact that it’s highly addicting with watching the market, reading all of the news involved, and the fun of dabbling in altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:36:41
Hey man when anything bad happens (like when I decided to buy some litecoin at its ATH and then crashed seconds after) it’s just lessons learned, and now you won’t make that mistake again.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:38:56
Did you even take 30 seconds to look through this place before you posted this?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:29:23
Do your own research on something you want to invest in, only allow yourself to be convinced by your own research not others. STICK with the time proven method of holding, when times get tough like they were just put your phone down and go to bed like I did.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:23:34
It’ll drop down to a negative dollar amount any moment now. Please sell all of your holdings so I in turn can sacrifice and buy it from you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:19:33
They’ve already confirmed that bubble has burst and will never go past 17k, quickly sell your coin and leave this subreddit because bitcoin is dead now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:11:56
If you’ve been in since last month then you’re still in the green, stop letting yourself feel this emotional response to other people’s panic and ride it out, this is absolutely nothing new for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:10:36
How long did it take you to think up this joke omg hahaha so original. 4/7 would read again
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:48
If that’s the case invest a little, when you have earned enough money, withdraw your initial investment and now you’re playing with house money. So no loss!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:06:24
How long have people been saying this now?
