My business does a few hundred thousand per year in visa and our fees are at 1.8%. I wouldn't think amazon would be anywhere near 1%

I looked at the wallet of the guy that sold for two pizzas, and he still had a few hundred he was hodling IIRC. This was back in december, so it could have changed since then.

I agree. I've heard a few stories of guys who did that that ended up killing themselves. Really sad stuff.

Mine, too.
I don't use my account for anything (and haven't logged in since January of 2013) but got these emails this morning.
My account does not have 2FA set up, but I didn't care to because I do not use it. It also has a password that is unique to mtgox.com

I also am an owner of a local business that would like to accept btc for our transactions, but not convert them to usd. Is there a good way of doing this that keeps some sort of accountability? Most of our monthly transactions are automated, and are a subscription to a monthly service/due.
