The dip looks to be starting now...
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:30:21
Ah yes the munchkin button
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:19:28
What is it with the YT links, don't people read anymore?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:05:23
Ah right, didn't think about that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:22:56
So enlighten me? Was it a stupid question, and if so how?
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:49:31
Ah, wondered why that didn't turn up.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:57:02
It's instructive to see some of these words in context, I get what they mean now (hot wallet... of course!). And I saw Charlie Lee's atomic swap tweet the other day. It's all very exciting and I'm sure solutions will emerge.
Since writing I've got a better handle on 2x and it gives me the willies. Not good at all.

I see, didn't know about the spam issue, but can't that still happen with small blocks? I read about proponents of doing the opposite and shrinking block sizes in order that the network could still be used over radio for example. I like this idea .
I don't see the future of bitcoin as a payment system for small transactions, more as a backbone currency or global distributed bank for bulk storage or large transactions. If Alts of some other tech could bridge the gap for micro payments in seconds then might scaling turn out to be a non issue?

As Winston Churchill said, I can learn from my mistakes, but you my dear will always be a dick.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:00:15
Understood. But you can still use crypto for things visa prevents, the circumvention cost is extra transaction time. Everyday transactions where transaction time is crucial, grabbing a coffee on the way to work, fiat/visa still works.
I can imagine a future that is more complex an intermeshed with fiat than the purist fully decentralised one. That said the more dc the better. At minimum I'd be happy to be my own bank, receive work payments and do large financial transaction or things like monthly payments via bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:41:02
Right. In the mean time there's still fiat for your latte.
Which begs the question if a fully decentralised system is necessary. Why not continue to use fiat or a 3rd party like visa for small transactions, paid for monthly in btc for example?
(Edit: googling drivetrain now...)

What's layer 2? Lightning network I've heard about?
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:13:06
Ok so bigger blocks forces more centralisation due to transmission speed, would that also occur if blocks increased at a slow incremental rate? Slower than the rate of growth of global internet capacity?
Not saying I support slowly growing blocks or a jump in size, just curious.
Edit: ta for the link!
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:51:43
So tell me, how do know my kids exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-30 09:07:26
It's incredibly shortsighted to just focus on the rate of increase of the upper bound or even the specifics of chip design. There are a multitude of ways technology grows, just look at smart phones. They're not faster than the fastest desktops, but there's billions of the fuckers. The growth is in breadth not just height. Then there are the sideways movements e.g. The shift from cpu to gpu is a good example. I used to buy a new desktop every year when cpu growth made it a no-brainer. I stopped about 5 years ago and switched my business over to gpu solutions, which are modular and scalable irrespective of die size.

Thanks for the link (text, much better than video)... that's pretty much what I had in mind. I see that it would require a hard fork if such a scheme was implemented in the future. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:21:45
Fully backed up data there and totally not your ego speaking. Got it.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:27:32
Ok. Got a name for any of these that have been proposed, so I can google?
@_date: 2017-09-30 11:03:58
Thank for the link, v useful
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:34:05
I'll have to reread the white paper. I'm curious why the scalability issue wasn't foreseen by sataoshi (or was it? Though if it was he didn't implement a solution)
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:15:40
Pedants who don't realise people understand it's not a true 'law' but an idiom that usefully captures the concept of technical progress in computing for the sake of non-rigorous, friendly discussion can shut the fuck up as well.  
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:25:01
Water off a ducks back. They don't get the irony of their comments, which is mildly amusing.
I've watched a few of Andreas' talks before. But videos are so inefficient.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:58:54
I have alts on GDAX/coinbase. How will the hard fork affect those? Will they only be tradable for 2x coins after the fork? I assume I can still move them to other addresses off gdax if I want to eventually trade for btc?
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:45:13
No it's unchallenged traditions and ideas that hold back human progress.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:45:26
The set of all replies: -1/2
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:16:13
YT links are not really conducive to discussion tho, are they.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:41:02
There like the same idiots who save fiat. Planning for the future...what a bunch of losers!
