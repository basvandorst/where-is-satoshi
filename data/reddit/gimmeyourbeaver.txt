Blockchain or cockring. Most people only care if it's going to go up or go down

@_date: 2018-08-08 07:39:34

I don't see bcash

Sure they won't die but become irrelevant. In theory, anything can be added to btc if there's actual need. CT alone will wreck havoc Monero market cap. Simplicity/rootstock adoption will turn Meth and stupid contract coins upside down. LN adoption means the end of bcash lite and doge. So in the long long run they all gone. altcoins are just for speculation game.

I won't call unless the hotline takes btc thru LN

Everytime I hear a piece of trash becomes a society leader I increase my stash. Trump won, I bot. This scummy little military dude became Thailand dictator, I bot. Trump and Kim shook hands, I was all in.
