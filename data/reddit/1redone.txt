How do we know the private keys of the wallets on that device weren't tracked though :(

Is that a coffee like drink made from a macadamia nut?

Thank you for the link. I thought I was at least familiar with the he concept behind the top 25 coins or so, but I'd not noticed that one before
Their chart tells quite a story.
For the curious, it was a very odd coin in which you would stake a amount of currency for a fixed period of time and they would guarantee returns of around 240%. You could not pull your coins out earlier for they would be used to fund a trading bot which would buy and sell cryptocurrencies to make that guaranteed Roi. Suspiciously no information at all about the training Bots was made available not even a history of past trade or performance.
But wait, there's more! The coin further added a complexity of a tiered referral system just like a multi-level marketing scheme.
*e: added info on what the coin was.

I'll have to set price drop alerts for some huge percentage then :)

Ohhh whats the last one called?  I'm trying to find a way to succinctly write up instructions for my family to use in case I step in front of a bus, but am very paranoid about how to do it securely, and the lifespan of a device like that.
The last one looks very easy to use and understand...but what if it loses charges?  Would I need to store it with diasy chained trickle charge batteries or something?

I'm one of today's 10,000s, what is bitconnect and why is it a scam?

Because he mentioned another currency? Why report him for that? At least he is commenting on the article (which not a lot of folks are doing)

LOL, what is Mitch McConnell doing in this list?

But it settles daily, doesn't it?  Seems like you'd put up $18 k (or 40 % of it since you can use leverage)  and then get some chunk of cash daily.
Of course, you need someone to be willing to bet against you too in order for this to work.

Old Yellers worms came back, he's scooting round the tree on his butt like a Choo Choo. LOL GRANDMASTER FLASH

What do you mean by 'wall'?

You're going to have a hard time being effective changing people's minds with that kind of delivery.

I've got 850 in btc, almost there!

It'd be cool if people paid for access to wifi or to view blogs. Like a small value coin, maybe worth a nickel or something, just to say thanks.
I get thousands of hits a day, but that doesn't amount to much in ad revenue.

I'd love to see the spread of tipping into other aspects of internet culture.
I run a blog for developers and sysadmins. I write meaningful stuff and include copy paste production quality code and walkthroughs. I do it because I like to, but I get 50k hits a month and that only equals like $75 in ad revenue.
If we had an easy mechanism to tip content creators, we might see even more content being created.
I hope this idea spreads. I have a few authors in mind who I'd definitely send $2 or even $20 over to in order to thank them for helping me in my career.
How could this sort of tipping be facilitated elsewhere?

I could write a service / dashboard for you in powershell. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's very similar to Python

What does sat/b mean? Is it related to Satoshis? If so why use that unit instead of milli bitcoin?

I've never heard of fun coin. What do you like about it?
I feel cursed with this need to believe in the white paper and mission behind a currency to be interested in holding it or mining. Like MusicCoin, it's a neat idea... But why would I use it when I have Pandora / Amazon / YouTube music available.
I don't buy the mission so I don't buy it.

How does that work? The atm has a wallet you target for a transfer?
I've mined bitcoin but never spent a penny of it.

This doesn't really have anything to do with IoT devices.

It looks fabulous! You'll have no issue finding a job with this.
If you haven't, make a nice about me page with recruiting info. Then call some IT recruiters in your area and show them this.
If you can't find a recruiter look for some meetups of the tech stacks you wrote this in, then look for their sponsors. Meetups are almost always sponsored by IT recruiting shops.

If you could have paid off your student loans, why not do it when we hit an all time high at 20k?
A priority of investing is profit taking to lock in earnings. If you never sell anything... What's the point?

Talk about a fluff article. I think it would be well served by adding some analysis to each chart.

Tu is actually pretty good

I will definitely buy a full bitcoin if prices drop that low again

Stop checking this every day.  Day traders pretty much always lose money and you can too if you won't just do some research and then **stop fucking with it**

My money is in coinbase. Is it hard to send it to a different wallet?
