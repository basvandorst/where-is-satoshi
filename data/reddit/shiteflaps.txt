Yep. You can send £10k to anyone in minutes every single day and not get charged a penny. 
Or pay for coffee/beer/snacks with a contactless card instantly. 
With the new wave of banks that are focused on apps you don’t even need bank details. Like Monzo/Sterling. 
That’s where the real innovation is.

Well we use a model called ‘free-if-in-credit’. And are one of the only that does this. Which is pretty self-explanatory. Most other countries charge monthly fees. 
They make up the money from things like loans and overdraft charges. If you never use those services, you get baking for free. 
The banks don’t particularly like this model, but they’re stuck with it as Brits expect it this way. If they start charging, people would just move to another bank.

Well I don’t pay anything. That’s a fact. My service is subsidised by people using the banks other services. 
The socialist government comment was the retarded bit.

Clearly if they’re worried enough it’s fraudulent to ask you questions - clearly not. 
They’re not asking these questions for fun are they? Why would they make extra work from themselves? Fraud is a massive problem and they’re obligated to take reasonable steps to reduce or prevent it.

No shit. Banks offer free accounts because their customers are more likely to use their other services. 
I however don’t need credit, loads, overdraft, payment protection insurance. So to me, they’re free.

I don’t need luck. My money is completely safe, spread across a broad range of assets, banks, investments and property in two countries. 
See you in one of the many threads with the title -
“I lost my entire life savings”
“I sent my bitcoins to the wrong address, what can I do?”
“The exchange has held my fiat for 4 months” 
I know you feel like a pioneer fighting against the big bad institutions but you’re really not. Your ability to understand risk is fundamentally broken/non-existent. There’s only one of us that needs luck.

This is brilliant. Could’ve kept it subtle for a bit longer though. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:03:11
I’m gonna make a crypto with only 10 tokens available ever. 
Following this logic they’ll all be worth billions right? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:17:25
so $100k in btc?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:05:07
I bought 110btc back in 2011 on a UK exchange called Intersango. Now i own my house outright. Suck it. 
And yes. It’s absolute fucking garbage. Sorry for your recent losses. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:49:18
No our Government isn’t socialist. They’re right/centre-right and we operate under capitalism. We fucking invented it you melt. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:47:19


Just when I thought this sub couldn’t get any more retarded people like you come along. Possibly one of the stupidest things I’ve ever read on Reddit. Bravo. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:56:30
No I don’t pay anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:15:18
No worries. Fair play to you for not doubling down and claiming that somehow we were still left-wing before pointing to any single government service. It has happened. 
Trust me, the UK is fully capitalist. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:28:07
Stop hogging, gimmie some. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:03:22
This has literally never happened to me across any bank in 20 years. 
Is this sending large amounts in and out of crypto exchanges by any chance?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:16:42


Luckily your opinion doesn’t mean shit in the world of fraud regulations. 
If your payment is legit, it will go through.
Explain how LN is innovate? Because from where I’m looking, it’s looks like a stealing pile of shit that fixes absolutely no problems. 
It’s amusing how much your moaning about being asked a few fraud questions. And then willing to use something as hilariously complicated as bitcoin/lightening for basic payments. Including the risk of losing everything to a hack/fat-finger or bug. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:38:49
I agree with you but unironically. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:28:04
It’s not that I don’t *think* I’m paying. I’m not. Have you heard of the concept of loss-leader products? Banks know that some people will get services for free because there is enough overall profit from other people buying services. 
Do you know literally anything about retail banking in the UK? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:17:33
Jesus Christ. I didn’t claim the banks were doing anything out of the goodness of their heart. I just said, the banking services I’m offered are free to me. Which they are. Because I don’t pay anything for my current account, and I don’t pay anything to move money around. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:30:14
Do you think that bitcoin represents email in this quote? Lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:55:49
This is basically but for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:29:10
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:08:34
$200k at $16k or $16k total?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:33:39
Great! I and the rest of the world are glad that people who think bitcoin is a good idea have *absolutely no say* in financial/fraud regulations. 
We’ll stick with our system. You play with your magic beans. 
You’ll be forced to use regular services anyway. Because nobody with any sense will accept large payments from you this way. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:04:40
I didn’t miss the boat, made shit loads of money and still post there. Because crypto is garbage. What now?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:27:01
I spent £200 as my first investment too bro.
Luckily it was in 2010 and I paid off my house. 
Unlucky!
