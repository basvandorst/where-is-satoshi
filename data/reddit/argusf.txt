Politicians do not care about the long term, they only care right up until they are due to retire. That is why I'm not worried about crypto being legislated out of existence, it will not be a threat to the current establishment. Many of those in power would rather ride the BTC wave themselves. The one thing that will hsppen is stronger tax rules / enforcement, as governments try to grab hold of as much CG tax as possible. BTC overtaking fiat is someone else's issue.
Same thing for banks, most of their money is made from investments in the stock market, which isn't going anywhere. They would rather invest in BTC directly and take a cut of that profit, which is what we are seeing now. The people who run the banks will be retired well before BTC poses a real threat to their existence. And the bankers do not care about the long term performance of the banks - just look at the sub prime mortgage crisis.
The people who are most threatened are the payment processors (Visa, Mastercard etc,.) who have carefully built up the current system and for decades, have been pushing hard to have cash withdrawn. Crypto is a big threat to their market, which is why IMO they have been so keen to invest in the Zuckercoin.

Well, anonymous communication scares the authorities in the same way that anonymous currencies do. So plenty of vested interest in getting it shut down before it got too popular.

A lot of these coins have a face value and are therefore technically legal tender. Although it should be noted that the value of the metals in the coin are usually far greater than the face value.

This would never happen in the west. They would rather let inflation run its course until you need an impractical quantity of the current highest denomination bill (e.g. $100) in order to buy anything. They will then abolish cash and force everyone to use Visa/Mastercard.

Cash works during a power cut or internet outage. BTC is a replacement for electronic fiat money (Visa/MasterCard, Bank accounts) rather than paper money. I predict, even though eventually all fiat based currencies will be obsolete, there still will be paper currency (backed by bitcoin) for this reason.

You get close to being taxed that much if you are a high earner in some countries. Where I live (the UK), if you earn over £50,000, then the effective tax rate is around 50%. Add on to that fuel duty, sales tax (VAT), council tax, duties on alcohol, tobacco, insurance, etc. then you really don't have that much left over.
£50k may sound a lot, but in many parts of the country it really isn't - especially noting house prices in the south east, where you would be lucky to get somewhere you would actually want to live for under £300k.
It's a different story for the actual wealthy who do not need or want income from work. Investment income is taxed in a very different way, and you get to keep a much higher proportion of your income as a result. Plus, you have the resources to be able to take advantage of these tax loopholes that nearly always exist(which only ever seem to be open to the rich and/or politically active).
Most tax seems to be a way of preventing people from joining this "elite" who do not need to work. If you are paying most of your wages in tax then it is much harder to have enough invested to not be reliant on salary for living expenses. Plus, banded income tax ranges is a direct disincentive for people to work towards increasing their income.

That is true, however it really wasn't that long ago when we were on the gold standard, and our currencies were pegged to the value of gold.
Of course, this change isn't going to happen overnight and would likely involve major events (complete collapse of currency, civil war, etc.) before it would happen. But that doesn't mean it is impossible.

A lot of people also do not realise how debit/credit card payments actually work. When you use your card, you are asking your bank permission to make the payment. They are completely within their rights to say no, and there is nothing you can do about it.
This is not good if you were trying to make some non-essential purchase, but becomes a much bigger problem when you are relying on that card to purchase food etc. Imagine if China abolished cash or mandated that all payments must be through the card networks - the government doesn't like what you have said so they remove your ability to pay. Quite a simple way of getting rid of 'inconvenient' people whilst also instilling fear in the general population.
It is no longer your money when you deposit it in a bank.

Lawful citizens are also using them for their cash stashes, which is mainly why the EU is coming down on this now. If you are a law abiding EU citizen, then the only way the government wants you to store moderate amounts of money is in a bank account (at which point it isn't really your money anymore).
It is a different story if you are a successful criminal and have bribed the right people, as can be seen by the billions of dollars of money that has been knowingly laundered by the banks.

It has a lot of uses. However, none of them are for your benefit.
@_date: 2019-04-15 10:43:34
That is a very good point. Card payments online rely on users handing out sensitive information in order to authorise the purchase (full name, cardholder address, date of birth, etc.) - it is not possible to purchase something online without divulging at least some of this information (as well as your card number, which is linked to your real identity). With bitcoin, this is unnecessary and people can make truly anonymous purchases.

The issue is the debt is increasing every year, and borrowing is required just to pay for existing commitments. It would be like saying I earn $50,000 per year, but I need a $30k to $60k loan each year because the car needs repairing, and to cover the interest for the previous loans that have been issued.
Now, for example, if the debt was used to pay for some one-off major infrastructure projects that were designed to last for 10 - 20 years and would be beneficial to the country, and a clear plan for repayment was made, then this would be less of an issue. This would be similar to the house mortgage example you gave. The trouble is that this is not the case.

The authorities will suddenly take a very keen interest in your coin destroying activities if you are someone that is otherwise law abiding but is a threat to the government.
That is the danger of having huge numbers of laws on the books that are never enforced - the government still holds the right to enforce those laws whenever it sees fit.

Sorry to hear this is happening. You have made the right first move by SARing CIFAS. You may also want to check National Hunter, which is another UK Fraud Prevention Agency. I would also SAR Barclays to see what information they have. They probably won't disclose too much, but you never know. Plus the information will be useful if you need to bring a case against them.
I would look into opening a basic bank account with another bank and using that as your main account where your salary etc gets paid in. Preferably use a bank which you have no current history with. It's important that you get the *basic* account, as you will probably be declined if you tried to open an account that can have an overdraft etc.
You have a chance at getting this removed, but it is going to involve a fight. There was a person I heard of a while back who had this exact thing happen (invalid CIFAS registered, unable to get pretty much any financial services) and who had successfully fought to get it removed. I believe his online name was Never in Doubt, and he runs the All About Debt forum online, so it might be worth speaking to him.
My rough legal understanding is that, unless you personally were convicted of fraud in a court of law, CIFAS flags are on shaky legal grounds. But don't take my word for that!
A side note: I personally would never use any of the localbitcoin services where you provide your bank details and third parties will deposit cash over the counter into your account. That is seen as a massive risk indicator by UK banks, and unfortunately, as you found out, the UK banking system is set up in a way that they can completely fuck up your life if they want to. All the more reason to use bitcoin :)

Is that how drug cartels can successfully launder billions of dollars through the legacy banking system, yet normal citizens get treated like a potential criminal for trying to buy under $1000 worth of crypto?
The rules never seem to apply to those at the top, or those who bribe the right people.
