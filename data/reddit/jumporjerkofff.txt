The first time btc hasn't had a potential 50% attack in 6 months and some arrogant bitcoin moron declares it 'the most decentralized cryptocurrency' only comparing to the two most usless POW shit coins out there. Keep up the good work

Living in Australia there's no need to use btc to gamble but I do it anyway because it's just fucking awesome. It's just so fun and convenient. I can transfer btc from one betting account to another in minuets. I can't believe it hasn't got 5% already. What's up with the peoples in this world?

15% btc
