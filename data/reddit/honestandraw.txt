Also, there's Visa/Mastercard, even Apple Pay for that. We don't really need the blockchain in this case. The blockchain should only be used by the Banks as a settlement layer.

If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.

Who do you think your LN node will connect through? xD funny how you say “Banks?” as if they won’t run the main LN nodes, I think you got your answer right there. 
Or you have an argument that proves LN nodes won’t have to be subject to money transmitter laws and won’t be run by the banks?

Talking about PR? The crowd with their "hidden scores" and "CSS-forced-unhiding" of comments are more of a concern to me.
The rest is just the community and bitcoin user base voicing their beliefs. Stop trying to make it seem otherwise.

I agree with you. Too bad the sockpuppets of r/bitcoin are too strong here

There's a debate on how bitcoin should scale, one side proposes an immediate solution and the other a more complex longer term solution.
But the main problem is governance and politics, the bitcoin core team of developers, or "Bitcoin Wizards", is unwilling to cooperate, compromise, or even have a open communication with other teams.
You should read both sides of the story, you wont get any info about other scaling options on this sub because its highly moderated with bias supporting the core team and ignoring any scaling proposals that come from any other place.
And one last thing, its also important to note that a big part of the core team work for a private company called Blockstream and many users think this to be controversial as the bitcoin protocol is supposed to be a public and open source project.
If you want to read about the other side of the story you will have to find other mediums as you wont find any information on this sub.

You on the other hand, choose to be the Government’s puppet. 
There’s nothing wrong with protecting one’s privacy, in fact you sound more ANTIFA than anything. Wasn’t the right the one that protected our privacy???

You just did with that great comment. Maybe level actually 
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:25:41
What a cheap and douchy comment. Are you now saying that being civil and polite is a bad thing? 
I thought that's how intelligent human beings deal with issues, I might be mistaken and this would rather be resolved by a fistfight!
With all due respect, get out of here, go back to your corporate welfare and let us be civil and polite in peace.

You mean Bitcoin Cash?

Hah man, that is exactly what bcore &amp; allies have been doing for the last 4 years, smear campaigns, c e n s o r s h i p , etc, etc, etc, aish it baffles me how one sided this place is, not to mention that it subverts Bitcoin's ideals ENTIRELY. 
Frankly, I'm disgusted.
