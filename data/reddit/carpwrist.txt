This guy...

Did you send them a spreadsheet of all the times they said no? 
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:41:04
It does if you live in a warm climate.

Need a 0 between that decimal and ellipsis. Thought we had a bitcoin  baller in here for a second. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:43:52
Wow, you actually talked to a lady about Bitcoin. Not only did she remain interested, she fucked you. 
You're a hero in my book OP. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:54:39
oh you... 
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:27:20
Soon we'll have pizza crunch suppers. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:54:11
Aw yiss! Just picked up a Crucial M500 240GB SSD for 0.193 magic Internet moneys. Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:08:25
Now I'm not saying I'm a gold digger...
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:11:35
The naysayers of yesterday were shortsighted. Today is no different for them. 
You're on the right path. Stick around while we reach the moon and watch them try to catch up. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:11:54
You can buy Zeevex cards. It's an extra step but it works flawlessly. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:24:48
Don't let him get in his zone. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 01:15:41
A good vanity address opportunity squandered. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:40:39
You should talk to the folks at [CommitChange]( about a possible integration. They don't have a way to take BitCoin, but they a solid network of non-profit clients. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 02:18:01
Are you an Apple employee? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 21:21:37
I'd go with Attenborough. While here in the US, we'll get the Oprah dubbed version. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:48:26
Thanks! Looking forward to trying this out. Some questions: 
Would be willing to post your results of running your bot? 
Have you done the calculations yet on your net growth compared in comparison to the 'buy and hold' strategy? Some of the other trading bot (Gekko) users reported that helper bots provide short-term growth, long-term loss. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:50:26
Every donation counts. I believe our shibe friends proved that recently. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:37:58
Lol it's not really a blender. That thing spins so fast it makes hot soup. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:50:39
I once chatted with a guy at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz about this idea a few years ago. Seemed like a good idea at the time. He later went on to reveal he had smoked crack the day before so I never followed up on it. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:19:11
I've gotten nothing but 502s all weekend from most of the links. At least your WAF is working. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:14:43
Laughing my lungs out? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 03:29:00
I rise. I fall. I rise again. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:30:16
True enough, but I do feel like they run their exchange safer than Karpeles ever intended to run MtGox. 
@_date: 2016-10-30 16:06:44
Wow. When will this shit posting stop? The Pirate Party did gain more seats, but the Independence Party won by a landslide. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:33:29
This captures the feels of me and my coworkers who bought in months ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:56:59
How could they stay away from our brilliant marketing ploy of Magic Internet Money?
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:21:03
I too get the sense that this is unwarranted fear, but to be fair, not every business follows PCI compliance very well (or at all). 
I have some personal anecdotes of large companies that don't.  
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:29:12
That thought occurred to me, so I logged in to coinbase *before* I started drinking. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:58:05
There's a chance that you'll run in to the customer who has not heard of BTC and might be curious about this elusive ฿ character.  You could make the [฿]( a hyperlink to your recommended Bitcoin explanation. 
On another note, are the bed frames pictured available for sale à la carte? If so, are they quiet?

He gets my vote for **Badass of the week**. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:24:50
Lost my phone? Then they could do a lot worse than steal my magic internet money. Just sayin'
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:03:09
Context for those of us who missed it? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:49:49
What shopping cart software are you using? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:04:41
This is more of Moronic Monday-type question, but if I'm using coinbase, what's the best way to pay them in BTC? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:35:38
That site is awesome! Have some magic internet money. 
+2 internets
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:29:47
Would you be able to expand on that? I looked in to getting a Black Arrow mining rig recently, but the profitability drops so fast it's just not worth the effort. I see this being a real problem in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:17:51
Baidu, Lightspeed, and other serious VCs &amp; investors would like a word with you. Also, you recall the Silk Road went down and the BTC in escrow were seized, correct? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:50:58
So... give him $50k and forward this to all my friends?
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:10:29
Tagging you as "I owe this guy a beer".
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:38:53
Yeah, felt like I didn't even have to get up from my table to pay, the hostess could have just held it up from the other side of the bar. I'll try that next time. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:55:35
Confirmed. You win. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:49:45
You shared an unpopular opinion on reddit. That's almost as bad as tipping in dogecoin in this sub. 
At least you stood by it. Have a hug &lt;('_'&lt;) 
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:08:42
No, it's a laminate of a printout of their address. Not sure what service they use, didn't think to ask. Now I feel silly. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:59:00
Welp, thanks for making my holiday shopping easy as bitcoin this year. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:33:32
They have merch, e.g. shirts, prints, books.

**EDIT**: Sorry for the potato-quality pic and it's Madison**'s** Grill.
