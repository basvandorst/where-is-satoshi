How about asking one Bitcoin owner a day to spend some? I accept Bitcoin and I have set it up clients websites too and it's pointless cause nobody buys anything with Bitcoin, as in literally less than 0.01% of the sales, as good as zero.

Like cars, airplanes, trains, motorcycles, power tools...

Nobody is asking you. You have to do it whether you are glad or proud or not. That's the problem.

There are plenty of countries other than Sweden, Norway and Finland that have it and it's terrible. Why always pick those countries? Are they the best comparison to the USA?

Maybe you should change circles? Yes there is a lot of other crap on it but also it's the only channel where libertarian views get something approaching a fair hearing.

Wealth inequality is a natural consequence of liberty. You can pick equality (of wealth, not equality under the law which is a different thing) or liberty, can't have both.

Its to do with consent. The CC companies are pretty paranoid about it. You can't use the word hypnosis for example anywhere on a porn site or they will drop you.

Which makes me wonder are CC companies legally liable if their services are used for illegal activity? Or are they just being pussies and bending over just in case, such as with blocking Wikileaks.

Direct democratic rule = unlimited oppression of 49% by the other 51%. Thank God for the constitution.

Why is bitpay recommended? I tried implementing it on my website and got nothing but hassle and ZERO support. I asked for support, sending a very straightforward test case that doesn't work and this is the reply I got 3 days later:
 "BitPay support offers technical implementation support for overcoming minor issues related directly to the implementation of our plugins, libraries and APIs. Your request for assistance has been forwarded to one of our support partners. If the problem is determined to be a defect within our library or plugin, we will of course continue to work to resolve it at no cost to you. If the issue is determined to be a need for more significant web development assistance, we reserve the right to recommend you contract with a local development partner. Our support partner will contact you within the next business day to determine the nature of your problem and the appropriate course of action."

Don't worry about that. Encourage bitcoin owners to spend some instead of hoard and pretty soon merchants will be happy to accept them. I have setup bitcoin payment for several websites and none of them have even 0.1% of transactions in bitcoin.

Good question. In Silicon Valley a successful small company like this would have instant access to almost unlimited funding, developer talent and infrastructure. Either this is a lot harder in Japan, or you guys are not doing it right.

Don't feel bad, Android isn't any better. And, needless to say, neither is Widows.

Ideally, people should come up with different words for different definitions. Socialism traditionally and per dictionary = state ownership of the industry and central planning of the economy. If you mean [mixed economy]( then call it that, not socialism.

I think the assumption is that since we support a stateless, decentralized currency, we also oppose intellectual property rights?! I don't know why one would assume that. Maybe the thinking is we are all rebels or something and its all kinda related to digital stuff so lets bundle us all together.
