Get your nose out of your ass and start thinking straight. OTC deals more than ever. Just because it doesn't show volume on the exchanges doesn't mean there is no volume.

Doesn't need to become money, it already is. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:22:39
Define money?
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:08:54
Compare it to the volume from 1 year ago, is it decreased? Your talking about bull run momentum volume like that should be the new standard.. Why? 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:09:21
Thanks for your work, this is most important.

How would they ever determine which coins/wallets belong to people that are dead and which don't?

Which tweet do you mean? There are several tweets from Rabobank where they discuss the initiative. 
 (here they are discussing the SSL issue.) 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:08:29
I see, interesting approach. But they are talking about; example every coin that hasnt been touched in 20 years is considered a lost coin. Thats just dev-community consensus. 
Pure technically this wouldnt be possible i guess.

Dutch bank called Rabobank is running a pilot for their own crypto wallet, called rabobit. This is a pilot and it is not known if they will really launch this platform.

You do clearly not understand how the underlying networks work..
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:40:50
This is a kucoin address
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:59:56
Good link is 
EDIT 13:37 
Now they have SSL.. LetsEncrypt. These bastards. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:35:17
Possibly a direct connection to a certain person trough his e-mail adress? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:27:04
This made my day
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:52:40
Nice, will bookmark this
@_date: 2018-03-21 10:38:35
Depends which app
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:48:59
TL;DR They fucked up. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:22:47
I do not think this is possible.
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:45:43
Interesting approach 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:05:48
Sounds Good. Where can i get more info?
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:11:50
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:01:56
And by the time they are finished they have to pay extra because of inflation 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:45:52
i wonder how many wallets and clients of other coins/projects are being exploited in the wild.  Anyone got similair cases?
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:44:28
Does Monese work in EU too? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:27:41
Lot of scam airdrop these days, do you manually check everything?
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:58:52
