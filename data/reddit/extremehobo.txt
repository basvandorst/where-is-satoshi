I have a love/hate with MtGox.  But basically this is done to protect you from their point of view.  After the flash crash caused by the hack forever ago they have taken extra special care to not let BTCs leave in the hands of the wrong person.  Keep in mind that BTCs are anonymous so if some other jerk hacked your account and took them all out, they would be gone forever.

They really need to work on the web design.  I see a cool laser sight on the front page, and I cant figure out any way to purchase it or see its price.  Then, attempting to add another item to my cart I get no price and an error telling me to refresh.  I refreshed and the error was still there.  I then added another item to my cart (2x of the same) and the price was shown in BTCs (finally).  It would be very useful to see both a cash and BTC price on the items im looking at.  On a plus note, the conversion fees arent THAT high but they are still there.

I never had to do the driver license thing that some people had to do to restore their accounts.  When mine was restored I was given several questions to chose from including listing recent transactions and estimating my account size at the time of the crash.  It also helped that my password was semi-complicated.  I pity you for having to give them all the stuff you have.

Interesting idea, like being able to identify blood diamonds or jew gold.
The only problem is that its really hard not to accept money if you need it. Also the headache for employers would be outrageous.  Imagine one guy doesnt want to take money thats passed through the porn industry, another doesnt want BP money, another doesnt want money from Proctor and Gammel for animal testing, and another doesnt want money that supported abortions.

I dont like trusting thousands of dollars to companies that have only been around for a short period.  Any company created by an existing and established company would actually have something to lose, its reputation.

The one counter point to that is that sometimes your buyers would be getting the short end of the stick and thus might not buy your gold.  If BTC gain in value the gold you were selling for effectively $10 could then change to $15 and kill your sales.

Hopefully.  A lot of the questions were pretty subjective sounding though.  One was basically "Try to remember the exact balance of your account" and the other one about the ip address had several levels of how *good* your answer could be.  The Dwolla option said they "may" ask you to make a deposit to mtgox in order to verify you control the account, what determines if they make me do that?

Hrmmm, his conclusion is based on *bitcoins being goods* and I thought that to be a logical leap.  Is that not the proper usage of the phrase?
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:08:08
60,000 accounts, at a minute an account, would take 1000 hours for them to verify.  If they have 50 employees doing pure verification then thats 20 hours per employee. working 8 hours a day you are looking at just under 3 days assuming minimal breaks etc.
If they have something like 10 employees looking at the verifications, then you are looking at 100 hours per employee and thus about 13 days :-/.
This all based on my assumption that these arent automated (which i am led to believe based on the kind of questions asked) and that it takes 1 minute per account.  If its 30 second an account then split those all in half.
@_date: 2011-06-16 19:44:24
they corrected it pretty soon after this was on here.  Not that it would surprise anyone that they have been making massive code changes...

I can say it was hard for me.  IP addresses change so I was afraid of giving them my current IP and there was no way of knowing for sure what IP I was on before the crash.  I was buying and selling at the time they shut off the servers, so how do I know my exact final balance.
And what is 'enough'?  Shouldnt they have said upfront, when you hit submit, that you needed one or two more criteria before you would be accepted?  It said they might ask me to transfer some amount from dwolla to them to prove its my account, they didnt ask for that.  They simply said MORE INFO.
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:06:08

I have said this a few times, but before bitcoin gets mass acceptance its going to need an established company to run an exchange.  There are lots of Forex and stock brokerage companies out there that have experience handling millions of dollars.  When was the last time eTrade had to shutdown because its biggest account got hacked and pushed a stock to near 0?
@_date: 2011-06-29 03:43:34
If you have held stocks for any extended period then you know beating or not making street estimates by 'pennies' can jump a stock substantially.  Not saying that you should buy on the ATI segment alone, but if you think the rest of the company is buyable, then I would be willing to guarantee their ATI segment has crushed their expectations.
@_date: 2011-07-22 13:48:43
Confused, they actually had a really *great* quarter, this is why their stock is up 10% today.  This article doesnt even make sense, they were at a **LOSS** last year for this quarter and **PROFITED** this year.

Until there is major faith in BTC, expect any large volume selling to trigger massive drops as everyone is afraid of the possibility of losing everything.  If the most recent stock market crash taught us anything its that investments can go to 0.
As to what the actual stable price should be, no one knows.  And if they say they know then they are either lying or they think they have super-powers.  The information just isnt out there yet.

Nothing is wrong with short selling as long as it isnt 'naked' shorting.

A total loss is about as probable as getting a "100'0000% return" as he put it.  However I can say that I made well over a 100'0000% return...
Also, everyone really needs to remember that increasing difficulty does not mean LESS supply.  It leads to less NEW supply, which means the supply is still growing so demand has to at least keep up with that to keep price the same.  And dont forget the 1000s of people who mined 1000s of bitcoins a year or two ago and forgot about them.  These people will continue coming into the market and trying to make a quick profit with at least a good portion of their coins.
One more thing to add in relation to this "If you're expecting the miners/bitcoinionaires to suddenly explode with supply at lowering prices, you're most likely mistaken."
Look at the jump in any hard-hit stock during the most recent stock crash...
volume explodes the whole way down

I like that it supports payout through a bank wire without having to use an intermediary.  I could REALLY see that as being a useful feature when you need money fast.

I dont know what point you are making here.  The market keeps falling today, and the volume keeps booming, exactly as I called.  If you dont think there is new supply coming into the market helping to feed that (the oh shit i might lose everything crowd) then I cant refute that because theres no information on either side.
And yes, thats its ruthless was exactly the point i was making the whole time.  YOU CAN LOSE A LOT OF MONEY, which is also what ive been saying.  People should not 'calm down' and take it, they need to be using their stress for good and making hard decisions.

You are going to have to change your price hourly, a good example is the site btcbuy.com that sells amazon cards for BTC, that price changes basically every time you hit refresh.  They pull their price from mtgox.
From the buyers perspective there is no better way of 'descamming' yourself than word of mouth.  Using the above btcbuy again, I only bought from them after reading about several people using them on here.  As long as you can get a few early adopters to come in (either with your old customers or other online friends) you should have no problem getting new users.

There are 687,000,000 shares * $.01 = $6,870,000 if I am not mistaken.  Not a gigantic number.  Also, I am not sure of the profit margin on these things.  Their last operating income was only $182M so if the margin is high on the cards, then they could be looking at much better quarter than last quarter percentage wise.
Still none of this is enough to formulate a buy on their own, but their graphics segment is going to do great if you believe that the rest of it doing well.
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:39:12
"They would have only needed to press "withrdaw 10,000 BTC" from each of the ghost accounts (that purchased the BTC at $0.01 a few seconds ago)."
I doubt the price would have stayed THAT low long enough for them to withdraw funds but they def could have cashed out at some low number.

Disputed $3k in charges when someone stole my card and had a field day.  I guess it depends on your bank too because I had no issues, just had to sign some stuff.

Reminds me of the "predictions" 6 months ago that said it was going up to $150 or $1000.  All of these are just silly.

And its doing it with an outrageously high volume of 21 BTCs at a time.  How can BTC ever survive this carnage?

It's easier to transfer online than any other currency and for lower fees. This is why I use it sometimes over my own country's currency.

Nobody knows how much BTC will be worth then either...

No it isn't

They apparently have the amazing investment philosophy of sell on the dips and buy on the top and are mad that Coinbase has accidently prevented them from doing this.

I was mad and stopped running the BTC client after it killed a stick of RAM in my computer.  If only I had known that a $30 stick of RAM would be pennies in comparison...

That was me!  I do think about it every once and a while but I'm in a good place now and probably wouldn't have met my wife if I had all those Bitcoin bucks earlier...

I wish that I was smart enough to have a savings bucket of some sort.  Instead, I have just lived a little nicer than I would have otherwise over the last few years... and bought a new computer.

I did nearly the same thing.  Deleted the app but luckily not my wallet.  There isnt a chance your wallet is floating on that computer is there?

Already sold most of them all at well below today's prices. It still amazes me to think that my crappy desktop was able to do that.

And they were worth maybe a $1 at the back-then rate. Surreal.
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:26:33
Probably the latter.  I wasnt really paying attention to it back then (well no one was).
