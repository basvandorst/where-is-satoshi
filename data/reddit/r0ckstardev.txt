We need to take a look at stats in the end, but halfway through 36% of donations were LN donations. It's really great seeing that many LN donations.

I've met hodlonaut irl and verified independently that he is directly receiving donations. So, can confirm what starkness is saying.
At this point it's unfortunate situation of "you need to trust me", but if it becomes showstopper we'll see to address it.
EDIT: Tweeted out to verify -&gt;

I wish there are more positive community events in the future. There is so much energy in the Bitcoin ecosystem - that it often ends up being used for conflicts. It's been refreshing seeing all the energy directed into something positive and great.

The core issue with debt is that it's usually crushing those that DON'T have assets. So when you say "who owns receivables on $184 trillion" - it's usually loop that ends with money printers + billionaires... they borrowed at like 1-3% and are giving money downward at increasingly bigger rates... all the way down to credit card APRs that are at 25%+.
