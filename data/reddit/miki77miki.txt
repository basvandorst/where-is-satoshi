But the thing is, Ross really only did run a website, it's just that "website" just happened to be a website where you bought and sold illegal commodities. However, by Ross making this website he allowed  drug violence to be significantly decresed while increasing the safety and quality of product sold on the site. I understand that you were attempting to be satirical in your comment.

Do you have his college paid for? If not then make a college fund and sell 50 bitcoins and put 50 grand in his fund, you can hold onto the rest. You don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. Also maybe try investing a couple btc in different ventures, try buying some hashnest contracts, they will usually return around 4% after a year. If your willing to budge a little more it would be wise to sell some more bitcoin and put the cash into index funds.

Well, it kinda did. If someone placed up a listing for a pistol first of all there would be no category to place it in (again, because these types of sales weren't allowed) and as soon as a weapons listing would be found it would be quickly taken down as soon as moderators got wind of it and the vendor would be banned.

He was making the drug scene safer. Take for example a heroin addict, if you are a heroin addict you usually have no more than a couple dealers that are willing to supply you with what you need to continue living (no exaggeration, withdraws can kill) you are usually at the mercy of those dealers. Which means that they have no accountability, and will likely not care if they sell some product that is laced with fent or carfent. On the other hand, with the silk road there was a rating system which would allow you to rate the quality of the drugs you recieved and this resulted in vendor accountability. Also, there was an abundance of dealers that you could choose from, all of them competing for your business, if one dealer allowed heroin laced with fent or carfent to get out then no one would ever buy from them, after all, why would you buy heroin from someone who was accused of lacing it when you can buy the same product at around the same price point from one of the other dealers. Also, the faceless transactions sharply curbed the amount of violence that results from the drug trade and most definitely took away millions of dollars from gangs that used to hold total monopolies over different areas. While yes, drugs are bad and no one should use them, there will always be people using them, and Ross created a way for people to purchase and use them in a much safer way and undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Debatable, i'm sure the money was a factor but Ross was a massive libertarian that believed that the free-market would help everyone and wanted to spread that through the silk road. Before his arrest he would go on the forum and constantly chat about Anarchism and libertarianism.

The site was regulated, and quite well actually. I'm not sure where you are getting your sources of hitmen from, since hitmen were not allowed and if there was a listing for a hitman it would be immideatly removed by either Ross or one of the numerous moderators. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:56:22

I don't think you understand, the main thing that came from the silk road was vendor accountability and it came out of the reputation system. On the streets, you can get away with screwing over a few customers so long as the rest don't find out. Also, for new buyers it's even worse, since they are either a. Easy targets for dealers to screw over or b. Don't know the scene well enough to know who's reputable/ don't have the time. Where, on the silk road less than 98% perfect reviews could mean that people are going to not purchase from you anymore (due to the abundance of dealers). In-person dealing results in the buyer being scared of the dealer. Online drug marketplaces means the dealer is scared of the buyer.
Also, you're not even factoring in the HUGE amounts of violence that results from selling drugs.

In New York, where Ross was tried, the death penalty had already been gone for 8 years when the trial started, I hope you realize that.

While I don't have hard data to show you, it's quite obvious that the silk road rating system caused vendors to actually give buyers what they wanted. Which was high purity drugs and abundant information. When you bought a pill from the silk road the vendor told you the dosage and everything and would even recommend how much to take and how to take it. This was because if the vendors didn't give the customers a safe, and easy experience a customer would just go to another vendor that was selling the same product. On the other hand on the street, you would likely have a small amount of dealers that had 0 accountability and 0 reputation. I'm sure the silk road also helped lessen the amount of overdoses in the heroin community, because if a silk road vendor was found lacing their heroin with fent or carfent then it was game over for them and no one would ever buy from them again, since there was such an abundance of vendors. While on the streets you may be forced to buy from a certain dealer (that may have impure product) either of gang control or them just being the only dealer around.


Minors can also buy from drug dealers in person, there is no point here.

He was not convicted of hiring a hitman, or attempting to hire a hitman since the evidence wasn't solid at all.

My source is the rules on the silk road that stated you couldn't trade child porn on the silk road(Even you admitted this). I have my proof, i'm waiting for you to show me proof that people over-rid these rules. Which I doubt you will be willing to do since there was no transactions of child porn on the silk road.

Confusion- People don't understand the blockchain, nodes, private keys, and other things very easily
Lack of presence- You can't walk into a lot of brick and mortar stores, and there isn't a majority of online buisnesses  accepting bitcoin.
Fear- People think bitcoin will be hacked eventually or they think it is a huge pyramid scheme.

Odds are they knew because all he was buying was from wishlists, I guess it causes some red flags for some reason.

That's completely false, again, do you have any sources or is this just what you "think"?

There was no guns, and no women and children sold on the silk road ever.

There are 0 accounts of child porn being sold on the silk road, if there was a listing for it then the vendor would be banned, lose their vendor bond and the listing would be removed. Do you have any proof of any child porn being sold on the silk road?

The charge was sent to Maryland but that will never see the light of day because the corruption of Force and Bridges, the two cops involved in the case, was so immense that everything they touched was tainted.

unknown purities and ingredients?
That's exactly what the silk road stopped
When an individual would purchase heroin off the street, there is no ratings for your vendor, there is no vendor accountability, there is no impartial escrow system. When someone buys off the streets they have no idea what they're getting. On the other hand, the silk road allowed people to purchase from reputable, trusted dealers, where they knew the product they were getting was of a high purity and good value.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:05:56
The charges were dropped because there wasn't sufficent evidence and there was a good chance that the FBI agents on the case were falsifying documents. The whole point of the trial was to make an example of Ross, even the judge said it. Why wouldn't they tack on the extra convictions if they could?

? I'm asking you a question. You are you trying to say that Ross was a bad person because he hired a hitman, but I just showed you that that completely false. Can you please elaborate as to why you are claiming that Ross was a bad person?

If he ordered a hit, he would have been charged with a hit.
Even if he attempted to order a hit he would have been charged with it but he wasn't for a reason, there was no solid evidence.

It's because he ran as a Republican and was in the Republican debates. The partisan debates are about a million times easier to get into versus the presidential debates. The presidential debates are also planned to have viewership higher than of the super bowl. For example, Ross Perot was polling at around 8% before the debates and around 35% after the debates.

I sincerely doubt that he will get less than 1% this time around, last time he was in almost no polls, this time around he is in a lot of them. At most he's polling at 13% in some states, country wide I believe he was at around 8%-11%. I believe he will be able to hit the magic 5% this time around.
