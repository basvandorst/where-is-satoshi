With this technique it's also notable that there is no random generator being seeded when the bet is made.
    Resulting Random Number = (Server Random Number + Client Random Number) % (Random Number Max + 1)

Isn't advertising your stuff supposed to be prohibited on r/Bitcoin?

So hot that he's allowed to advertise his stuff on r/Bitcoin when nobody else is.

No, all other sites use a "client seed" to feed a random number generator. Here a client number is given and is combined with a server number that was already available when the game round was initiated.
    Resulting Random Number = (Server Random Number + Client Random Number) % (Random Number Max + 1)

The method I use to send cash to family in third world country: sell BTC on localbitcoins, ask fiat seller to make local bank deposit. They have the money in their account a few hours later instead of going to a Western Union office and expose themselves to the risk of getting robbed, getting dehydrated or getting killed in the lethal traffic.
In these countries when it's a risk just to carry cash or driving to the other side of town, Bitcoin is a godsend.
Now sometimes the banks steal directly from their bank accounts and the local fiat has high inflation but at least it's possible to send and receive money without the worst risks.

The most common chargeback reason is that the customer just don't remember the purchase and reports it as unrecognized. Makes your money disappear and the payment gateway charge you $10+ on top of that every time.

Funny the U.S. and U.K. send so much to Nigeria. Didn't realize the Nigeria spam is that successful.

because 100 x 1 satoshi has two decimal points, just like the other main currencies.

Again, this is advertising and supposedly not allowed according to the rules.

It's not just the Bitcoin debit cards avoiding the U.S. It's also Bitcoin exchanges. In the early 2000's companies had to target the U.S. because that's where customers with habits of paying online were located. Now everyone outside the U.S. are paying online and U.S. law enforcement makes it most comfortable for business to just avoid the U.S. completely. U.S. purchasing power is expected to fall by up to 40% the following years. Falling U.S. purchasing power and forever increasing regulatory burden makes it sound business strategy to avoid the U.S. for now.

It's possible that Circle has a larg pool of bitcoins and sell at market price without buying any coins. So at the same rate someone is buying, more coins are made available  and the price stays the same.
