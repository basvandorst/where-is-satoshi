Is it really worth the effort? Even if it did work flawlessly? The last thing I want to do when traveling is carry around and lump of metal and have a noisy, hot room to sleep in. Bearing in mind it's not running 24\7 either. I really don't see the point.

Thank you, I will look in to it and compare it against any other suggestions that come up.

Thank you. What traditional ones can you recommend? I only put lightening as if I'm doing this I decided I might as well support lightening.

I used jaxx a few years ago on pc and found their fees to be extremely high. I'll assume this isn't the case any more and look back in to them. Thank you.

The answer to your problem is to download the mobile app revolute. This is a very powerful app that lets you transfer money to any currency at the market rate. There are no fees for international payments. I would also recommend getting a card with them as it makes travelling so much more easier. There is a limit of (I think) about 5k a month, however if you are moving that much - paying £7 a month for a premium account is nothing and gets you unlimited with a load of other features. Do your research and check them out!
I assume that they aren't backed by the UK £80k protection scheme, so I don't recommend leaving large amounts on it, but you can 'top up' from your bank, at the press of a button in seconds, so there's no need to have a large amount sitting there.
