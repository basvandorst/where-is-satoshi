But you have to buy Euros if you're going to Europe because that's the only accepted currency. Why would anyone have to buy a bitcoin? Only investors and libertarians currently want to own bitcoins, so this changes nothing for mainstream adoption. Unless there is a mainstream service that *only* accepts bitcoin, most people will prefer to use their native currency. Until now the only such thing are cryptolocking viruses.

Gox is the prime example of why the market doesn't (always) work. The sole reason for their popularity is because they were the first exchange.

If you sell your ships or game currency for USD, then yes you have to pay taxes on it. 
Now, if you sell your ships for a real-life car, you still pay taxes on the value of the car. Otherwise everyone could evade taxes by moving value into an object and paying with that object. As long as it stays within the virtual world (ships, ISK, bitcoins), they don't care. If you exchange it for something that holds real value, you get taxed.

Anarchist vs stastist turns it into a black and white debate. There's a lot of grey inbetween. It's perceived as pejorative because a statist would be someone who LOVES government, while we realists know we need the government to a certain degree.

For a bar or 50p sweets it's not a problem, but from 50-100$ the merchant probably doesn't want to take on the risk of fraud. So they need a third party that will impose another 1% transaction fee.. and we're back at the old system. I don't see anyone waiting 10 minutes (or 30 if you're unlucky) for a confirmation, it's worse than our current payment systems. Bitcoin, in its current form, is not designed for offline sales.

Hoarding is the most logical thing to do when looking at previous returns, and it has the additional effect of making the market move up more easy when the coins aren't up for trade. That greatly inflates the price above its intrinsic/utility value. That's how you get a giant bubble.

For bitcoin to be widely used there has to be a benefit for the consumer. There is none, as far as I can see. At best the merchant might shave off 1% of fees, but meanwhile you as a consumer lose all consumer protection. Why would you want to use it as a payment system?

@_date: 2014-07-18 23:35:35
The reason why the banking system takes 3 days is unrelated to the currency being used. In Europe I can pay an other bank account within the country and it will be credited within a few hours. I can pay a bank account in an other  EU country and it will be credited by the next day (or 12 hours). The US is just lagging behind.
No middle man, sure. But without any middle men it is too dangerous to use for &gt;90% of the population. The middle men argument is useless for most people.
If merchants pass on 1-3% savings to the consumer, there is a very tiny benefit to it. I don't think it's big enough. Furthermore, in many EU countries it is (or will soon be) illegal to pass on payment processor fees to the customer. It's already illegal for brick and mortar shops, it soon will be for online payments. Bitcoin is no improvement here.
Regulations.. I disagree. If bitcoin can not be regulated, they will have to ban it completely. Businesses would stop accepting it immediatly, people still using it can be detected one way or another. Only hardened criminals would keep using it. You're not going to threaten a country's monetary policy.
As for microtransactions, I'll believe it when I see it. Development on the bitcoin protocol has come to a halt, and I have not seen any proposals for changes that could make it process even 10% of the credit card network.

How does Bitcoin save you money? There are fees in exchanges and in bitcoin transactions. Bank transfers are completely free, at least here in the EU. Merchants might shave off 1 percent, but for consumers there is no price difference. They even lose all consumer protection.


There was a thread here this week comparing the total cost for sending money abroad using Western Union and Bitcoin. Bitcoin turned out to be a slightly more expensive. 


Global payments, yes. Although regulation seems likely to kill that quickly, because global access means money laundering and terrorism.

HSBC's money laundering does not mean money laundering should now be allowed from now on. Stop bringing up the case, it's irrelevant. Bitcoin makes laundering easier, and if all restrictions were off there would be a massive increase in laundering.
HSBC wasn't fined for laundering, they simply didn't implement the AML regulations properly and as a result, 600B was laundered unnoticably. Those 600B would be laundered through bitcoin if it had no regulations and a bigger market.

4. Do not post about technical or scalability issues, they will be fixed in two weeks.
5. Do not post economic concerns, people will spend their coins when they're rich!
6. Do not express concerns about the crooks, thieves and unknowns that hold most coins. It's not important.

- The same patterns kept repeating for each of the walls : first several 20 - 40 - 60 btc bids, then ~300, then ~1000. Makes it more likely to be one person.
- It would have been more profitable for a whale to do a market buy if his intentions were to buy cheap coins. He decided to move up his walls to pump the price.

An important point about fees is that Bitcoin makes the consumer pay the fee instead of the merchant - BUT - the merchant fees are already included in the prices, not added on afterwards. So essentially you're paying both fees when you use bitcoin.

So you see bitcoin as an investment, not as a currency.
*Why* would you be happy if you could order food with bitcoin? 
Would you want to buy bitcoins specfically to order food with them? 
Why would other people want to acquire bitcoins to buy stuff with 
them? 
The answer is simple: you own bitcoins as an investment and more places to spend them means the price will go up. *You* aren't going to spend them (or with rebuy), but you hope other people will.
Chip &amp; PIN cards are push, not pull. To authorize a payment on the internet you have to give a code that is generated from your card chip data, pin, payment amount and a one-time code shown on the bank website. It's like signing a message with your bitcoin address.   It can not be abused on a large scale.

USD and EUR are real currencies because they are backed by the economy of the USA / Eurozone. Products are priced in their local currency, not bitcoin. If you buy something with bitcoin you're paying the equivalent amount based on the current btc market price. That's not how a currency works. Eg; You're buying a $1000  laptop and paying 1.46 BTC. You're not buying a 1.46 BTC laptop, because the price has to be adjusted all the time to cover USD production costs and profit.

I don't think you can compare bitcoin to the internet. The possibilities with bitcoin aren't endless - the data space per transaction is limited. It's slow. Plenty of problems that make it impractical for real time usage. 
You're trying to replace one broken system with another.
Maybe a next gen cryptocurrency will be useful, but it will always be far more complicated than the current system. If you want to dumb it down for the average user you end up with the same entities and structures as the current banking system. It's pointless.

I'm pretty sure that's not how it works. 
If I have to pay 10% tax on a 1BTC/$800 transaction, it's going to cost me $80. The tax office isn't going to accept 0.1 BTC several months down the line if 1 BTC is only worth $100 and 0.1 is $10. They want $80. 
Bitcoin isn't legal tender, they can't accept it. They might take it through Bitpay and collect it as USD, but then you're exposed to exchange rates again. You'd be paying 0.8 BTC instead of 0.1 BTC then.

The fee is paid by the person who sends the transaction. It's optional, but without a fee the miners can just choose to ignore your transaction because they wouldn't get any reward. 
The fees end up in an address owned by the miner. That is only allowed by the network when the transaction is mined into a block and the network confirms that your mining was successful.
Basically the miner solves the algorithm for the next block, chooses some transactions to place in that block, and collects the fees on it.

All of those technologies have a use to support its growth. Bitcoin is a payment alternative with 0 advantages for consumers and only advantages for merchants (fee reduction, if the default transaction fee gets fixed). You absolutely can't compare this to objects that have a use in the daily lives of every person. The only use bitcoin has for a consumer is the price growth, which makes it a speculative bubble.

Exactly, we can't have a bitcoin-only economy because at some point the conversion will have to be made to USD/EUR/... 
That conversion rate is fairly stable between regular currencies, but highly volatile in bitcoin. That's why it can't work as a currency until the volatility is gone. On the other hand, the volatily is where bitcoin gets its value. It's great for speculation. If the speculators are gone, what gives bitcoin value?

If the fee reduction gets passed on to the consumer partially then yes there is a small advantage. In my opinion that's just not enough.

I would definitely have a problem with it if this means the US or NSA has satoshi's coins. I don't want a global economy where 5 to 10% of all value is in the hands of a government.

Is there an other method to earn dollars than working or buying them?
You could beg, but nobody likes beggars.

Why do so many people in the bitcoin community beg for tips? I don't go around putting my paypal email in my signature everywhere.

Exchanges don't have one address per user account, they add many users together and just give you coins from one of those pools when you withdraw.

More and more countries are declaring bitcoin a commodity, not a currency. Even the PayPal owner said bitcoin will not be a currency until the volatility goes down. Accepting bitcoin for your work is useless until that changes as you will barely ever get paid in bitcoin. It's not a viable way to get bitcoins in the foreseeable future, so this thread is useless.

I hate subreddit fragmenting. A seperate sub seems unnecessary to me.

That's why you buy back lower. Nobody says you have to stay out permanently if you sell.

Bitcoin isn't anarchy. Regulation is inevitable and might turn out to be positive as it gives legitimacy to bitcoin. Governments need taxes to operate, and as long as the system is what it is, rules and taxes are part of it.

Had some funds in my PayPal account so I'd rather use them up first.

That's not what he's saying. Gold has an intrinsic value because it's mostly used in jewerly, and that will always have a value because it's pretty and shiny.
