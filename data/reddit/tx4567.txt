The moderator thought my previous comment about a bounty on Cryptsy and FatVern was too much - what a bunch of liberal babies moderate these sites.....
Does anyone know how far along they (Crypsty) was with their debit card?  If they filed ANY paperwork with the Feds, they should be seeing serious jail time - lying on federal paperwork is not taken lightly.  Hello Feds - you should be all over this, especially in an election year.  You guys are supposed to put on the theater of the government watching out for its' people.

Reddit and their thought police.  And people wonder why things like this happen because everyone is too worried about censoring speech and not going after thieves like BigVern, Mt. Gox, AIG, JP Morgan, etc. etc. etc.  Keep it up you guys, make the online world save while the real world is turning worse than Brownsville - now catch that reference you erudite tool.

If you do not think BigVern is not in on this, then take a look around.  His LinkedIn profile has mysteriously disappeared and no comments save for his departure to China.  He was in Military Intelligence - enough said.....

Bought one several months ago from Zoomhash.  Initial impression: very quite, runs off a 1200W PSU and hashes at 3.3-3.5 average.  Rumor has it that there is a Version 2 model out there that runs 3.5-4.0, but I cannot confirm it.  I am looking at picking up one or 2 more.

He tried capitalizing by offering a credit/debit card which if done like any other financial institution, then his name is all over a bunch of federal papers.  The feds do not like people perpetrating a fraud and then get into banking (usually the other way around).  The crypto market was maxed in terms of revenue stream and a credit/debit card offer by an exchange was actually quite ingenious - if it played out, he would have made billions.  But as we say, he fell pray to greed and sex (in middle of what will be a nasty divorce).
