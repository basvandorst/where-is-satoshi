There are accelerators you can try, if you have child-pays-for-parent, that will also help.
You can give us the blockchain info to look into it, chances are your fee was very, very low and it got stuck

Lightning is an off-chain way of paying with BTC, essentially. The way it works is quite complicated but could say you create payment channels with other people that you fund beforehand and send BTC back and forth and the only time it needs on-chain confirmation is when one party closes the channel.
(Please correct me if something is wrong, I'm very new to it aswell)
It's meant to circumvent a congested blockchain and the high fees that come with it. Additionally, confirmations take mere seconds, not minutes or hours, so it makes RL payments feasible.
It's still in beta and most wallets (wallet of satoshi, blue wallet, eclair wallet) are custodial, so do not put large amounts of $/BTC into them, but the concept is pretty genius.
Ping ponging is just a fun way of proving the concept and testing the transactions without paying anything.

Then you can buy as many sandwiches as you want! Additionally, if you're not in a hurry to buy a sandwich, just open the channel with like 1-10 sat/b, wait a day and buy it the next day.
Everyone who regularly pays more than a couple cents for fees is either an idiot or very, very impatient.

It is a good thing that transaction fees go up when the blockchain gets congested, otherwise you would have 3rd parties spamming the blockchain with their own confirmations without significant costs to prevent them from doing so. It's still happening to quite some extend right now, but it costs these services quite a bit, so they have to either succeed quickly or die off, and so the rising fees are a natural defense against it.
LN is a very, very young technology, not even two years old, and it's still in beta. UI/accessability is already a priority and solutions will be found to make it exceedingly easy for those businesses to set it up.
Stop being such a debbie-downer, things are going pretty well overall.

Lightning currently costs 1 satoshi. Is that low enough for you?

Someone should make a BTC escrow service for reddit so I could bet you on this.
