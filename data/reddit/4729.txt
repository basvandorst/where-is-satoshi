How do you deal with [Sybil attacks]( against the voting mechanism? What do I need to do to create a node, besides generate a public/private keypair? What stops me from creating a million nodes, all controlled by me?

Have you considered signing up on [LocalBitcoins]( as a seller? That would give people in your area a way to acquire bitcoins, and allow you to make a little extra money. You just need a way to replenish your supply of coins. Are you able to fund your bitcoin exchange account (MtGox or what have you) from your bank account?

I'm mildly worried about Zerocoin once it gets up and running (I'll probably just diversify into it a bit). Other than that, there are no alts thus far that have any real impact on the value of Bitcoin, except to serve as a demonstration of Bitcoin's network effect.
I *do* want to hear about alts that significantly affect Bitcoin. There just aren't any yet.

Try selling on LocalBitcoins. Assuming that you're reliable and your prices are competitive, you can potentially meet lots of people that are interested in Bitcoin.

Take your time.  :)
Once you're ready, it's probably one of the simpler things you can do to increase the availability of bitcoins in Botswana. I've been selling on there for a while now and I'd be happy to share what I've learned about it. Though I'm sure there are plenty of other folks here in who could help you out with it too (probably including Alec).

Build a solid reputation and leverage that. This is *crucial* for makers of security products.
BWallet is not (yet?) a suitable replacement for the Trezor, because the company selling the BWallet has no reputation. We have no reason to trust them.
SatoshiLabs, on the other hand, is quickly destroying the good reputation that they've previously built up.

You can lend them to margin traders on Bitfinex. Interest rates tend to be pretty low, but are a bit higher during a bear market.
[Joinmarket]( is worth keeping an eye on. It's still in early development, so I think it only runs on testnet for now.
Remember that if anyone is offering anything more than a small amount of interest without obvious risks, it's a scam.

While in general that sort of thing isn't a given, in this case there are things in active development that will make Bitcoin usage easier and more streamlined. Payment protocol, hardware wallets, ATMs, etc.

For a merge-mined chain to have the same level of security that Bitcoin does, all of the Bitcoin miners would have to participate in merge-mining the alt chain. That means keeping track of all the transactions and dust that we wanted to remove from the main chain, so we haven't really gained any efficiency.

10 minutes was selected to ensure that newly-found blocks have enough time to propagate across the network. Reducing the time target will result in more orphan blocks and longer chain forks.

ASICMINER has a cheap USB-stick ASIC in the works. Should be cheaper than a 5850, and have similar hash rates. Not to mention much less power consumption and no noise.

Computationally there is no difference. It's like a number in base 10 versus the same number in base 16. It's the same number, just written differently.

Looks like it's centrally-controlled. Zurker (the issuing organization) can inflate the currency, go out of business, or be shut down.
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:21:44
It's both easier and more secure to use a diceware passphrase. Memorize 10 random words, and you have a passphrase with about 128 bits of entropy. Even if an attacker knows you used diceware, they still end up having to find a random 128 bit number by brute force computation.
With the "mangle a memorable phrase" method, you end up having to remember a very complicated process, and you don't even know how much security you're getting out of it. It's likely that there's some attacker out there that will be able to figure out your scheme, now or in the future. With the diceware method, you know exactly how much computational power is required to guess your passphrase.

Why not just use a digital bearer certificate system? I don't see any point to grafting this onto the blockchain. Since you're already trusting a centralized issuer, a centralized certificate system would be much more efficient.

I'd rather have 3600 bitcoins per day.  :)

Change below the threshold is just added to the transaction fee. Since the transaction fees get combined with the block reward, this renders the transaction non-dusty.

This isn't an issue. The value returned by these units is going to tend towards something proportional to whatever their price ends up being in the long run.
The reason that ASICs aren't generally accessible right now is due to the uncertainty involved with purchasing one. If you order one today, you don't know when you're going to get it, and what the ROI rate is going to look like when you do. You could pay more to get it faster, but then you have to deal with the uncertainty of how fast the currently-high ROI rate will drop off.
As production ramps up and existing demand is filled, this uncertainty will gradually disappear. Someone who wants to dabble in mining will be able to buy a cheap USB-stick ASIC, and be reasonably sure that it'll pay for itself in a year.

If blockchain resources were unlimited, I would agree with you that colored coins are superior to centralized digital bearer certificate systems for contracts. Unfortunately they're not, so we have to look at what kind of trade-offs we're making.
Using a blockchain system for currency has large benefits. We're able to eschew centralized issuers entirely, which means that our currency can't be debased and can't be (easily) shut down by the powers that be. It's also highly beneficial to have a global currency that everyone uses, and a blockchain is well-suited for this.
While there are benefits to using a blockchain for transferable contracts, they're not as significant as for currency. We can't really avoid having centralized issuers in this case. The fact that the transaction-clearing mechanism is hard to shut down isn't as significant, because the issuers can be targeted directly. There isn't really any point to having a single global issuer, so we don't need a single global clearing system either (though a standardized protocol would be good).
On the cost side, we're not really dealing with "does scale" or "doesn't scale"; it's more a question of "less centralized" vs "more centralized". Increasing the overall load on the system means that marginal nodes drop out, and the network gets a bit more centralized, and a bit easier to take down.
Ultimately the market will decide if colored coins are a worthwhile idea. In the meantime however, we shouldn't shy away from changes that benefit Bitcoin's use as a currency in order to appease proponents of colored coins.
@_date: 2013-05-06 21:04:11


The issuer of any particular set of colored coins is still centralized. You may as well just use an ordinary digital bearer certificate system (such as OpenTransactions) instead of the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:29:22


This is still a bad idea. Cracking programs are able to deal with permutations. Whatever you come up with probably isn't as clever as you think it is. If you're going to use a brain wallet, the only safe way to do it is to use [diceware]( (or something similar) to create a passphrase with at least 128 bits of entropy.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:12:11
You've got it backwards. Bitcoin mining uses expensive hardware, but not much electricity. Litecoin mining uses cheap hardware, but lots of electricity.

It takes a much higher degree of technical expertise to run a GPU mining rig than an ASIC. Once the mad rush to acquire them subsides somewhat (due to increased supply, decreased ROI, and existing demand being gradually filled), prices for ASIC mining equipment won't be any higher than comparable GPUs were during their heyday. ASICs will be *more* viable for casual miners than GPUs were.

Why would you need to convert your BTC? You use them to buy the stocks directly, which are represented by digital bearer certificates.
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it solves the double-spend problem without relying on a central issuer to clear transactions. Unfortunately it requires a lot of resources to do so. In the case of colored coins however, you're already trusting a central issuer to make good on whatever the colored coins represent. It's a whole lot more efficient to just let them be responsible for clearing the transactions too.
@_date: 2013-05-07 16:00:59




In its most basic form, you have a server that stores all the certificates and a secret key associated with each of them. Whoever has the key for a certificate owns it. In order to transfer it to someone, you give them the key. They give the key to the server, and the server issues them a new secret key for the certificate, invalidating the old one.
If I have a certificate representing 1 share of XYZ Corporation, and you want to buy it from me, you send me your BTC, and I send you the certificate's secret key. You give that key to the issuing server in order to complete the transfer.




It's not entirely clear that Bitcoin will be able to scale to the point where it can be the world reserve currency and still be usable to buy a cheeseburger. Even if it can, that doesn't mean that it will also be able to handle the issuance of all the world's stocks, bonds, deeds, etc. A single company issuing 100 million shares increases the UTXO set size by something like 25 gigabytes.






Timestamped PGP-signed transaction receipts would solve this. Whoever has the most recently-issued receipt can be verified as the owner of the certificate. The issuer could even make a stream of these receipts publicly available so that it can be archived by third parties.




So require the bondholder to sign the transaction in order to transfer the bond the someone else. No signature, no transaction. I haven't looked into it in detail, but I believe this is how OpenTransactions works.




While this is a small benefit to the issuer and the bondholders, it comes at a pretty massive cost to everyone else, in terms of (ironically) more centralized Bitcoin infrastructure and higher transaction costs.

The electrum seed is a 128-bit random number, which isn't feasible to brute force. The passphrase is just an alternate representation of it, which is easier to memorize than the number.

I found this kind of suspicious, but I just did a quick review of the code and didn't find anything obviously malicious. While you still shouldn't assume that it's safe, it's probably worth giving the guy a chance and investigating it further.

Will you be allowing users to lend their funds to margin traders and earn interest (like on Bitfinex)?
