Also Warren Buffett- be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. 
Which scenario do you think we are presently in?

its all over CNBC and other popular media these days.  it has a large negative environmental impact to support use that at present is 99.9% speculation. there are massive regulatory risks.  hardly anyone has paid taxes on their gains which the IRS will come after hard.  the price skyrocketing is benefitting a lot of bad guys likely including north korea. the market cap of cryptocurrency is nearly 1/4 that of estimates of amount of gold held for private investment (not jewelery, central banks).  and bitcoin is still a very poor currency with acceptance by major retailers declining, not rising, and LN won't fix all the problems. 
these are all scary things that warrant being cautious.

you don't think we've gotten to "media attention", "greed" and "new paradigm" yet? I very much disagree...
This is more fun than it is a prediction.  And while I think its hard to argue though that this isn't following the classic pattern of a bubble, you can still reasonably be long on the view that if its not, the upside/downside is very asymmetric.

its not 12 hours, thats the difference between the ticks.  It goes back to mid 2017/$900

all I'm saying is that it objectively bears an uncanny resemblance to a classic speculative bubble.  I'm still long, but I think its something we all should be keeping in mind/managing risk around.
