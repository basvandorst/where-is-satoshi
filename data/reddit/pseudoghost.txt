And this was easier than using a credit card...how?

I’d say &lt;$10k.

It’s going to crash again, but it’ll go higher than last time before that....

If these publicly traded companies colluded together to support the price of Bitcoin, without disclosing those efforts, they would have committed securities fraud. No sane board member would ever sign off on that plan. 
Moreover, if it didn’t work, they could wind up with a huge unexplained hole in their balance sheets. 
Lastly, when such a move eventually became public, which it would, they would bring the holy hell of US federal regulators down on them and possibly Bitcoin. The net result would undoubtedly be worse in the long run than doing nothing.

Mt Gox will reopen,and immediately plummet as you can buy BTC on the other exchanges for less than you can sell on MtGox.  It's over.  BTC is going straight to the bottom.

If you base your investment strategy on chart analysis, you're going to have a bad time...

Market's going to implode tomorrow.

You can price yourself at whatever you believe the long-term exchange rate to be, but you'll just price yourself out of the market if there's any competition.  And besides, no one knows what the long term exchange rate should really be.  That's the more fundamental issue.  No one can reasonably hedge BTC right now because there's too much volatility.

BTC is a pyramid scheme.  If you got in early, then you stand to make lots of money by selling to latecomers who think it's a good speculatory investment, but as we've seen today it's not very useful as a currency; too much volatility.  
Personally, I think $300 is pretty reasonable for the peak.  There's plenty of room for the speculative bubble to grow.   
Once everyone realizes that BTC as a currency is dead, it will collapse in value.

If so, we're in the "return to normal" phase right now...

Irrelevant, because the actual value of even the subdivided pieces still varies wildly from day to day; which makes it unsuitable as a currency, where stability is prized more so than other criteria.

This is not true.  Merchants **will not** accept payment for a tangible good today, only to wake up tomorrow and have the accepted payment effectively worth less than the actual good was worth.  If that's the case, then Bitcoin will not survive as an actual currency.

The real problem is that there are no backstops to prevent the floor from completely falling out from BTC. If the bubble really pops, and panic *really* sets in, then BTC could become essentially worthless over night.

Fundamentally, BitPay is a hedging operation.  In the long run, hedging is a very risky business in a volatile market.  No company can hedge 50% dips very effectively, without charging MASSIVE fees associated with the hedging operation.  If that's the case, then BTC will die as a medium of exchange because the fees will efffectively be larger than already existing options (e.g. credit,debit,checks, etc).

From a purely mathematical approach, it does make sense that demand will exceed supply as more people rush into BTC, the quantity available per capita decreases, thus increasing overall demand.   You are right, there's nothing to prevent the price from rising until the demand curve flattens, which is why BTC is deflationary, and why BTC is doomed as a currency.  
Here's the death cycle: As more people become interested in BTC the value rises (i.e. deflation sets in), individuals with BTC start hoarding expecting the value to increase, new players join the crowd hoping to earn some quick bucks by speculating in BTC, the volume of non-speculatory transactions plummets, liquidity in the BTC market seizes up, eventually all transactions are merely speculatory swaps, some small event triggers panic selling, price collapses, speculators are forced out, volume of non-speculatory transactions increases, etc.
You should know by now, that the market is not rational.
