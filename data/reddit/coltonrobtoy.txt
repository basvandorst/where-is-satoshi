Block rewards already support them.

False, if mining costs rise too much then some miners leave &amp; difficulty decreases to where it is profitable again.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:17:11
You can't hide any coins. The ledger is public. But I'm just messing with you about declaring losses on Fiat...I don't think that would go over well in the US
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:04:42
Bc 3 commas is 1 billi

Never hold your coins on an exchange
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:38:31
U can use a paper wallet via Wallet Generator . Net
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:05:48
If you have to pay taxes on BTC gain, then surely you can write off Fiat losses, right?
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:19:07
Dude I deposited a $15k check over a week ago and they gave me 1/3 two days ago and the rest in 4 days. Had to hold it to make sure the check wasnt 'fraudulent'
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:57:48
You can sell a percentage brother. Dollar cost avg back into Fiat
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:58:27
Dang it
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:04:26
I hope you don't have 5 commas of value locked up....
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:51:42
Coinbase Is the safest because they withdraw and put them in cold storage wallets off of the exchange. My rule is: my money, my control
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:11:38
Having a loss doesn't decrease your tax basis? In US it does
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:18:22
Same. 36 hrs on bittrex
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:48:27
:D heck yeah!
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:47:24
thanks, that's a new exchange I haven't heard of. I would like to set up auto transactions those such as 'buy $50 of BTC every Thursday at 8:00 PM'.....that is what I am looking for (and be able to do that with fees &lt; 0.50%)
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:59:28
I'm on 32 hrs lol. 19/20 confirmations
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:02:21
Probably neo and omg
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:15:47
I was going to guess low $4k as well
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:29:25
What's Fiat?
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:28:24
What's an MSB
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:24:38
I don't think you should worry about it. BTC can increase 15% in 1 day. So after 1 day your net increase is 11%. Then after that u receive the full appreciation value
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:28:28
Fee would be the same if you were sending 1000 BTC
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:51:49
Same as the Bitcoin Bucket above...
 If Nobody wants to buy Bitcoin its 'financial worth' is 0. 
 If Nobody wants to buy Oil or Natural Metals, their 'financial worths' are 0.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:35:26
\&gt;Ok, but to put an income producing asset's demand at zero, you also have to remove it's ability to produce income as that is the only scenario that it could reach zero demand.
If nobody buys it, the Demand is 0.
Cash Flow helps to increase demand, but it does NOT Guarantee it.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:44:23
This is Correct.
@_date: 2019-01-20 16:46:56
If Nobody wants to buy Bitcoin its 'financial worth' is 0.
If Nobody wants to buy an Income-Producing bond or an Equity-Owning Share, their 'financial worths' are NOT 0.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:21:56
To find out if something has 'Non-Zero Financial worth' it Must be Reduced Down to the state where 'Demand = 0'.
Sure, Bitcoin will Always have a Non-Zero **Price** as long as there is *at least* 1 Buy-Order somewhere in the World...aka 'Demand &gt; 0'.
But that says nothing about its 'Financial Worth'...that which can only be Discovered when looking at it in a State where "Demand = 0".
@_date: 2019-01-20 18:05:40
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:08:41
In between the "Financial Worth != 0 when Demand = 0" Bucket and the "Financial Worth = 0 when Demand = 0" Bucket?
I don't believe there is any in-between.
Currencies, CryptoCURRENCIES, Oil, and Natural Metals all fall into the "Financial Worth = 0 when Demand = 0" Bucket.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:20:14
Could I copy Bitcoin's codebase and change the Genesis Block date to Feb 24, 2018, start with a difficulty of 0 on Block 0 and start mining all by myself?
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:15:05
greater than 100 BTC or no?
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:57:53
They said it's not an audit right in the paper
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:23:20
But if it's going up can't they just sell higher?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:34:24

I could've guessed by the non-stressed tone of your post haha
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:42:43
Nope, no solution yet. Has to be done manually
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:04:31
how do u short on Kraken?
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:38:48
Thanks, that makes sense. How would I make sure it's its own 'fake Bitcoin' blockchain starting from block 0? Meaning I don't want it to share any history with the 'real Bitcoin' chain.
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:42:19
They have no reason to, and I have no idea if anyone will. I'd like to do it to make sure Bitcoin's 'digital scarcity' property applies even to direct copies of it with no changes at all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:35:43
What's the difference between full nodes and mining?

University of Mew Nexico?
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:32:24
Does this mean copying the address of my hardware wallet and printing it out?

I'm on GDAX as well. How do we sell BCC there?
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:08:22
agreed. but man, I think it's so much better than the products/services provided by banks right now. The Feds just emptied BTC-e's hot wallet and [transferred $100 million USD almost instantaneously for only 9 cents](
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:24:42
ok, that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:53:29
it's ok, m8

let's goooooooo
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:58:54
why wouldn't every buyer choose this option to avoid fees? im guessing it's because it will take longer to fill the order?
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:07:29
what if i do a post-only limit order at the market price. do I avoid fees since i will always be the maker?
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:15:36
use GDAX. 0.5% fees
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:18:53
lmao that's mining not an exchange
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:50:42
even better! but for limit orders you can still be charged a fee if you're the taker, correct?
