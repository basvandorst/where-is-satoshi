I think it's more a case that litecoiners are more chill than the BTC camps at the moment.
There has been some discussion regarding the 75%, no real objections.

If a trader is short and the position moves against him it's quite normal to dump a position all in one go which would look similar to this.

It's not so much the optimisation, it was agreed amongst Chinese miners not to use the ASICBOOST exploit (optimisation)  but it seems they were doing it covertly and damaging the network by mining empty blocks.

@_date: 2017-04-07 08:34:04
Well in reality the "optimisation" is actually a bug in the code that allows this, and using it damages the network (mining empty blocks) so the miners agreed it would be bad to implement.  But ANTPOOL couldn't keep their fingers out of the cookie jar and implemented a covert version that they thought no one could detect.
If segwit activates the bug is patched and the advantage goes away, now it makes sense why that lot are so anti segwit ;)

Coins are mined as a reward to the miners, the equipment and infrastructure required to process crypto blocks is expensive, who would spend the money for the network infrastructure if there was no financial incentive?
As for fixed value, that's not how free markets work, a coin is worth what someone is willing to pay for it, crypto markets such as exchanges put buyers and sellers together and together they negotiate the price.

1) Two nights ago, "anomolous activity" led staff to believe that an attack similar to the ETC syphon attack after the ETH fork was being prepared for August 1st
2) To isolate these effects of this activity, the btc-e core trade engine and dependent applications have been quarantined
3) Work around code has been completed and tested in a sandbox environment, however:
4) BTCe should be fully functional *only after* August 1st as a contingency

@_date: 2017-06-01 07:25:40


It actually wouldn't.  LTC's codebase is so similar to BTC that the changes to switch or integrate LTC into existing BTC payment channels are minimal.
Ironically LTC's biggest weakness  (just a copy of bitcoin) is now a big advantage.
Recently a BTC dev posted he only changed 2 lines of code to get his app working on LTC!  That is fucking awesome.

I think the point is Bitcoin is being treated as money so no VAT (or GST, Australia equivalent) on purchases.
The UK went through the same thing a few years ago, they were thinking of taxing Bitcoin as a commodity which would incur VAT on purchases effectively making all UK exchanges uncompetitive.  They reversed that decision and now bitcoin is classed as money.

I don't understand your logic.  Satoshi abandoned BTC and look at the shitstorm there, people trying to interpret if the 1Mb blocks were intended as permanent by him, wouldn't it be easier if we could just ask him?
LTC faced similar problems as BTC getting segwit activated, you know who's largely responsible for pushing that through, Charlie Lee .... FOUNDER of Litecoin.
If you think having an absent creator is a good thing maybe you should re-evaluate.
