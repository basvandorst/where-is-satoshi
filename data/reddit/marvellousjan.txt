Isn’t it possible ? I use EUR and if I deposit it via bank transfer I choose when to buy btc.
So you can have a wallet with EUR for longer periods of time.

Maybe another important fact, you have to pay 10 €/$ for the card BUT it looks really nice :)

Such a bad article, of course there’s value behind a coin, or what do miners do for example ?

Nice answer ����

Yes I’ve used it. Very simple and easy

I’m not sure but if you want to buy large amounts of BTC, you have to contact either coinbase or blockchain.info

But it takes a few days to confirm your personal data.

Officially yes, but based on my knowledge how problems are solved there, and generally how people behave there, I’m not sure.

Maybe because they are the biggest exchanges and they don’t have to advertise with low fees ? Or they just don’t care because they are the biggest ones 
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:23:59
No I don’t think so or I don’t remember, only 10€ but one time payment, not every month or year, only ONE TIME. 
And deposit fees but these are really low like a few cents

But maybe bigger countries will follow
