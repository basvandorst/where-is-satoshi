feel bad for those who sold under 7k, and feel good for those who buy under 7k. hopefully before the end of February BTC hits 12k. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:11:23
Interesting read.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:10:45
Even the water flow wasn't able to stop Bitcoin!. Go for $12k before the end of february!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:09:11
I wouldn't have done that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:06:14
No, it's more steady than you think. I'm also still making profit on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:29:07
If it's okay to you. can you give me some source or links their interviews.. thanks :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:55:33
What a pity.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:32:13
Looks great. I'm using Bitfinex, I'm also really fond of them.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:14:01
Sounds wonderful.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:10:17
Lol. I won't stay away. I'm finally making profit on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:22:20
Looks great, but I prefer Bitfinex over this platform.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:06:41
Finally it's official.. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:57:05
Damn. That's insane.
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:51:09
Lovely story. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:33:26
I guess around the 0.4 Lambo.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:48:03
Could be. I just bought some extra BTC on Bitfinex. I really hope they will bring me great fortune again. Moon, here I come. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:05:58
True. But when you bought in the dip, you're gonna make some great profit out of it. I already made a good amount of money on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:35:32
That would be very unprofessional, you should be screaming.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:47:37
Yes! Great to hear that. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:55:15
I don't know. I know what could fix me, a therapist.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:44:39
lift off in 10,9,8,7..
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:32:10
A good investment :) 
@_date: 2018-02-25 09:40:07
This upgrades will benifit the bitcoin traders in different exchanges
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:09:22
To get multimillionaire.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:25:42
Cool stuff, sometimes i will explore more in your shop. and buy some.. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:25:01
That was so COOL!!!
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:19:00
Lol, exactly. History keeps repeating itself.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:42:52
I think if you have the funds to do it. You are in a good shape to hold it for sometime.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:41:39
Probably yes, but I still have some faith.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:53:40
Sounds cool, but is it really that trustable?
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:47:07
Didn't noticed this as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:22:28
Bitcoin is finally increasing in value. I'm finally making profit again on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:46:04
Probably. But it will be alright.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:33:10
Love to hear that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:00:24
I prefer using bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:13:01
I'm finally seeing my charts rise on Bitfinex. I'm looking forward to the future.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:36:02
I think using segwit right now at betfinex is very favorable to the bitcoin traders
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:23:56
That doesn't sound really good. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:14:18
I like this.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:42:31
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:47:33
Oh oh, things are going the wrong way.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:09:24
I get his choice. I also bought some BTC, but on Bitfinex. I'm sure it's value will raise and I will make profit again.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:29:05
that's great. I like the idea.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:16:16
Hmm, can't wait to see it actually happen.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:48:39
Same for me, but since if been using Bitfinex I don't have that problem anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:18:38
Sounds lovely.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:42:06
Of course they're not having a benefits on it.  
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:26:35
Pretty impressive for a 17 yo.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:34:52
That is amazing!!  
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:36:31
Wow, that's great!
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:17:10
watching it with bitfinex
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:30:57
Hard one.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:05:15
No no no my friend.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:13:31
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:36:21
No probably not. I think the cryptocurrency will stand it's ground. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:24:26
Who will be the responsible for this?? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:33:29
woohoo, let's go! Making profit again on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:28:28
Wow . This is so good! 
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:22:19
Finally! Thanks
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:34:25
This upgrades will fasten the transactions especially when segwit will be fully utilize in all platforms
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:32:45
I'm also making profit out of these dips on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:02:51
Very well said... I agree with you. You have a complex idea on how this market works.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:18:52
I don't know either.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:46:04
Hodling will be worth it. You'll see.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:01:57
10K, i'm already stargazing.
@_date: 2018-02-26 04:53:34
i see. we thought he gave direct to pizza shop lol , thanks for the information.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:09:42
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:27:58
Yes , i tested also in bitfinex.. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:04:15
I believe that cryptocurrency will rise again. I just bought a shit load of cryptos on Bitfinex. I hope it will give me some profit in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:26:21
He's right. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:13:39
Did you submit the required documents and undergone their  verification's process?Have you deposited there 10K$ initial deposit requirements?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:41:04
Interesting news.
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:40:33
I agree with you .And I think banking industry look at the crypto market as a competition on their existence
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:11:34
I agree on that.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:45:42
send me your nude, I mean node.
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:30:26
I think this news of bitfinex having ING as their counterpart banking institutions may somewhat provide additional proof on their legitimacy as a strong platforms in the market right now
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:57:28
I'm going to make a lot of profit on Bitfinex in the upcoming period. I'm really happy I've been patient. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:04:38
Great news for them. Can't wait to see it actual happen.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:20:02


i was wondering the same thing .. but there is no public news from him, we don't have any idea what he did.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:12:35
i hope it will push through
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:14:55
True! I agree on that.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:52:19
having a segwit with bitfinex is a great news for bitcoin traders
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:30:51
yes probably i'll do the same thing.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:10:33
That's really fast! If more things could be bought with cryptocurrency, it will probably give an economic boost. Instead of holding cryptocurrency, people will be consuming.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:51:25
That would be awesome, can't wait! I hope they implement this soon.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:21:22
That's a good thing right?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:27:15
Just wait for the next dip. If you're going to buy some crypto, use Bitfinex as your platform. They have really reliable support, most liquid change in the world and fast transactions with low fees.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:27:41
That's a very sensational prediction. But i think it will rebound this coming week.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:02:48
When are you going to post the fourth?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:35:28
Finally making profit again on Bitfinex. I'm curious about it's future. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:59:50
this upgrades will favor bitcoin traders
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:15:23
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:34:38
Nothing is predictable. Let's just hope we're going to make the right choices. I already made a great amount of profit on Bitfinex, I'm really happy already.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:44:26
But spies are cool, right?
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:59:22
Yes i think maybe it is not a big relief but it help to lessen the speculations of some traders. It proves  Bitfinex has a legitimate corporate account although we do not know how much they have...
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:59:00
I think they are trying to discredit the popularity of bitcoin but as of now it was already in a very strong foundation.As far as the government is concern, they shared the same opinions of banking industry where they look bitcoin as a threat on their business.
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:53:19
I agree on your story. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:09:36
See ya! I'll be waiting on the moon. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:11:44
They need tax of course! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:33:01
Segwit inclusions on bitfinex and coinbase will lower their transaction fees and favorable to their bitcoin traders
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:27:55
I love humor.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:17:31
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:45:21
Hype hype hype! I can finally make money again on Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:41:49
thanks my friend.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:41:04
Bitcoin heard my prayers. My chart is rising, I love to see this on Bitfinex.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:04:00
This is another Fud trying to discredit bitfinex. until this point, they are doing well in the market.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:57:27
Very easy to understand if they explain it like this, but people shouldn't underestimate it.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:08:38
I'm becoming a millionaire on Bitfinex. Business all day long.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:43:09
Is this a reliable chart?
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:46:27
you can use bitfinex to sell your bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:08:31
Probably , bitcoin will be more famous from now.. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:26:55
Very well said.. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:42:50
Yeah, you're right.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:36:11
Great to hear.
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:16:17
you said there are groups of people you called pumpers and suckers' where do you belong with the 2? everyone here is investing for profit so it is worth the risk and also everyone here has its own agenda. What's yours for bitfinex?
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:43:22
So true. But I'm glad I made money with bitcoin on Bitfinex last year. I think I will also make profit with some cryptocurrency on Bitfinex this year.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:40:33
Sounds great. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:01:13
Yes, it is. I don't doubt it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:15:34
They'll take the whole hand.
