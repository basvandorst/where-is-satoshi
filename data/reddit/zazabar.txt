I feel the solution to this problem is going to be exactly what Visa is, a 3rd party processor who will hold bitcoins for clients and then when they spend them they can process the transaction internally instantly.  Seems backwards, but without setting up a new coin, I don't see how BTC itself can be changed that much.

That would be the optimum solution.  However, I use this computer for gaming as well, and I like my nVidia card for that purpose, so I really don't want to trade it in.

Actually, GUIMiner uses the RPC client, so its the same thing as what I'm using now.

Just curious, what is the average payment per share at the moment for MtRed?

Mmm... right now, the most that non-tech savvy people can do though is just use the currency.  As the difficulty increases, the type of computer you need to use to make a profit versus power usage is going to change drastically, eventually weeding out most at home miners (unless the price spikes to major levels).

I haven't had a single problem with the site, and I'm based in the US.  For those who are doing wire transfers, are you in the US?  The site clearly states not to deposit fiat to the site if you live in the US.  
As for withdrawal problems, you should only get holds if you are sending or withdrawing with real money.  If you stick to depositing coins and withdrawing coins, you shouldn't be getting any holds.
