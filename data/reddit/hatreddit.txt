(if you don't have  the initial entropy already and only have the first 11 words (or 121 bits) this option below won't work, as the below mentioned hash also uses bits 122 through 128 which are part of the 12th word). To compute the checksum properly, first you need to run all 128 bits of the initial entropy (as bytes) through the sha256 algorithm, and use the first x bits of its hash digest, where x is calculated by dividing the initial entropy by 32. 
So for a 12 word mnemonic, which needs a minimum of 128 bits of initial entropy, 128/32 = 4. So the first 4 bits of the hash digest from that initial entropy is attached to the end of the last group of bits (as the prior 11 groups of 11 bits each are already full - and will map to the first 11 words, while the 12th/last group of 7 bits still needs 4 more to reach 11. 
Bottomline, the checksum value is half of the last word, and the other half is the remainder of the last group (when concatenated equal the index number that corresponds to the last word.) P.S. there are only 16 possible 4-bit checksum values, or 2\*\*4, which could be brute forced easily if you also had the prior 7 bits, that would be easy. But if you don't have those leading 7 bits of the last group/word, brute-forcing seven bits is 2\*\*7  which is only 128 combinations but won't help as you'll have to try each result against every 2\*\*4, resulting in 2\*\*11 overall or all 2048 words.

Such a useful image would be further improved if the binary number corresponding to each index value was shown (instead of the base 10 value currently used), as concatenating the binary values that correspond to each word in a recovery phrase is what produces the initial entropy (i.e. the binary values are really what is most useful/valuable here) that seeds the wallet.

Key takeaway: "the one impacted address that is associated with a Blockchain wallet was imported into that wallet and was not generated by our software." (i.e. Blockchain.info not affected by this researchers findings, as per their statement)

Who agrees that the proper way to capture valuation from the entire family of bitcoin-related offsprings including btc, bch, btg), is to hold a like-minded amount of each, as if you were a long-term investor (or HODLer)who got airdropped an equivalent earlier on? For example, if you were brand new to crypto today and wanted to buy bitcoin, you'd buy 1 btc, 1 bch, and 1 btg. I think this type of approach could help safeguard the family of bitcoin offsprings, despite any inter-family 'flippenings' or shift of hash rates from one to another.
