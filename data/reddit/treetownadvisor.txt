I will address this.  This viewpoint is not a financial one.  *Fraud is a problem, but it is not a big problem.*  Most fraud ranges within the 1-2% range of gross values - pretty good loss levels in *any* application.

There's no such thing as "the legacy financial system."  That itself is a construct of the Bitcoin community, who are deluding themselves into thinking that a concept developed several thousand years ago is somehow new.

Bitcoin is not the answer to 3^rd world stability.  Valuing human rights, freedom to choose (democracy) and a strong legal framework are among the right answers.  
Out of such an arrangement arises a system of currency that a country can back and a people can use.  Not every country's values are equivalent, and thus few countries want to outsource their monetary policy to an outside party.  I'm shocked that even the Euro has made it this far but that system was put into place - literally - by force.  You're hoping that bitcoin voluntarily supplants even that system.

So, you had originally said something along the lines of:
* *"Is the FED (or any central bank) supplying volumes of new money in order to keep prices slightly inflationary to counter that they would be deflationary..."*
I cut off with elipses because I think you should have stopped there - at least, that's where I would have stopped.  If I had to continue, my argument would be with those who state that money supply is manipulated in order to deal with shortfalls in aggregate demand, caused by the natural business cycle (this would be the classic Keynesian argument) coupled with the realities of inelasticity - namely, the price and wage sort.

If you're using Bitcoin just to transfer money, make purchases, etc - your value proposition right now are "low fees."  It isn't quite "easier" - you have to jump through all sorts of hoops to use BTC (I've done it).
If, on the other hand, you're using BTC to circumvent laws, you shouldn't count on it lasting forever.  National governments might move slowly, but they move nonetheless.  You don't need to kill something entirely - you only need to attack certain parts of a system to bring it down.  There are dozens of ways to do this - if you think creatively (and understand how global finance works), you could think of ways to do this to Bitcoin.
I think you are wrong.

What I get is that Bitcoin is money that has a few other neat tricks.  It is not revolutionary.  I hesitate to even call it evolutionary.  It's just another form of something we've figure out long ago.

I'm not certain you are using "store of value" correctly.  A "store of value" does not usually contain within it gut-wrenching, vomit-inducing moves in price.  A good store of value can be used to shuffle around wealth even on a short-term basis with a reasonable expectation of a steady price (which is why you see very stable currency money market funds).

No, there are not.  Ultimately, two people are going to fundamentally disagree (see above), with the only path to resolution being through a party which has the power to enforce the outcome.  
It is clear that you are simply anti-state.  Our eloquent comments to each other aside, I would say that my views have won out over time (that is, been accepted into the mainstream) whereas yours are now considered to be "fringe."

Why would I disagree with that statement?  It's absolutely true.  


You probably need to reconsider your rights as a human being.  My own views started with the writings of Hobbes and Locke - you could start there.  I assure you that in your "natural state" (the state where you have the most rights), you are also the most vulnerable.  




Once in a while, people will use this example.  I have your answer.
Being a technology geek, I have long been part of the "connected crowd."  Back in high school I was working just to cover the cost of a 3rd phone line in my house which I used to connect to various bulletin board sites to get free games and such (back in the 90's).  
Through college and even beyond, I was no stranger to getting free stuff.  Napster, Limewire, etc.  Bittorrents were no different.
However, at some point, things changed.  I had a life; a career, a wife, a home, a child on the way, assets to lose.  Whereas in the past where I would have just downloaded a torrent, I found myself asking "how much is a copy of X-Men:  First Class really worth?  Is it worth a huge fine, a legal penalty, having my name in the public record, etc?"
The end result is that I now pay for music and videos, because I want to be part of the legal mainstream.  Not because I don't like free stuff, *but because I have something to lose.*
That's how the government operates.  They don't need to take away your bitcoin.  They just need to make anything associated with bitcoin so onerous to use that legal-minded individuals won't touch it.  That will force bitcoin into the grey/black market, where it will remain with cocaine, methamphetamines and stolen art.  Not quite a great place to "invest" in, if you ask me.
*Edited to add everything before bittorrent.*
@_date: 2014-05-08 12:23:11
You're crazy.
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:59:04


Why the future?  People use ATM cards and spend what is essentially electronic money, except in doing so they enjoy all of the legal protections of the state (for example, a strong legal framework and contract enforcement).
They can do so with *whatever currency they please.*  Why bitcoin?  When I visit Euroland, Visa ensures that I'm *always* using the local currency, no problem.  Visa covers me if there's fraud, and merchants willingly pay fees for the business.  The fees might be "onerous," but I wouldn't doubt for a moment that if bitcoin ever "takes off," fees will be soon to follow.
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:30:08


There it is.  "Pick a stock."  One asset class of many.  
Of course, only bitcoin is digital money.  Things like options on Treasury futures are...what are they again?  I can send them instantaneously; there's no counterparty risk, and I can trade massive amounts for very little in fees.  
@_date: 2014-05-10 11:22:05
People who put time frames on predictions do themselves no favors.  
It's like people who try and put targets on the stock market.  I have clients who ask all the time, "where will the S&amp;P 500 be in a year?"
How the fuck should I know?  What I do know is that I'm not smart enough to have a handle on the decisionmaking process of a global economy to the point where I can sharpshoot a number for you in a year's time.
What I can tell people are things like "I see stocks as a great place to invest over the next year.  Better than bonds, or (x) commodity, or (y) currency."  How good it gets is beyond me, but I'll make sure to position ourselves so that we're set to take advantage of that trend.
With that in mind, I'm *confident* that bitcoin will not *supplant* anything in the global financial system.  It's just another form of digital money.  A "hobby" might be a better term.  If you don't get that, you just don't get money, finance or economics.  I don't need to make comments like "in a year," or even assign prices.  I simply need to have a good idea of what *won't* happen.

And here it is - the "downstream economic fee" argument which, by the way, is among the more spurious "pro-bitcoin" lines out there.
Implicit in your argument is that the altrusitic bticoin community will remain fee-free in the future (doubtful).  However, what it ignores is exactly what you get for these fees.
I get fraud protection - but I know that the BTC fanboy brigade somehow thinks that using BTC precludes fraud from the transaction (it does not).
More importantly, I get *ease of use*.  Visa takes care of all the currency translations, wherever I use the card.  Visa ensures that vendors all have POS machines that enable me to use my card all over the world.  Visa stands in to back transactions, and if I have a problem, Visa does the dirty work for me.  Visa makes it as simple as pulling out a card.  If I lose my card, Visa takes care of it and doesn't leave me on the hook for anything (compare/contrast to people who have lost hard drives/keys/etc.)
I could go on.  The reality is that credit cards - Visa/MC/Amex - are ubiquitous.  They have an established infrastructure and ecosystem that deals with the entire process, soup-to-nuts, for a paltry fee.  A fee that you'd probably pay, by the way, *even if you didn't use the card.*  In other words, I doubt that a benevolent retailer would give you a 2-3% discount because you're the BTC user as opposed to the Visa user.  Most will just pocket the difference - meaning you'd be paying Visa prices, but getting shitty BTC service.

Again, the technologies behind Bitcoin are likely to find their way into the current global transaction schema.  The legal uses of bitcoin, where no other transaction/banking service currently exists, are really just a subset of the global financial system.
Of those that might find a need - the unbanked - financial assets are small.  [McKinsey estimates that there are 2.2 billion unbanked, and 800 million of those live on less than $5 a day.](  These areas are already being approached by microfinance applications, of which (again) the technology behind bitcoin is likely to help.

Granted, the community might fancy themselves as "smarter than the rest," but that would be a grave error on their part.

Fees in the current financial ecosystem do not exist to support the cost of the ecosystem.  They exist to provide profit to the ecosystem enablers.

If Bitcoin gains greater adoption, you can count on greater fees.

Some people just won't admit when they're wrong.  This hyperinflation scaremongering is just another example.
It's not just that we haven't experienced hyperinflation.  We've barely experienced inflation.  In fact, the most recent concern is one of *deflation.*
This has not dissuaded the Austrians (of which I once counted myself as a member).  "It's only a matter of time" they say now, instead of seriously reconsidering their arguments.
It is because of (among several reasons) the Austrian's refusal to accept prima facie evidence that has relegated them back to the fringes.  The hoarding of gold and - more recently - cryptocurrencies as a libertarian wet dream solution to the "usurpations of the state" have left many "cryptocurrency visionaries" to be viewed mostly as financial and economic crackpots.

I'm deeply interested in the subject of finance.  I follow a lot of markets and instruments in which I don't currently invest - from stocks, to bonds, to derivative products (futures &amp; options), and currencies.  Also, as noted, I'm interested in technology.

Everybody understands what inflation is, and how to deal with it.  Familiar concepts such as "the time value of money" should help you navigate that landscape.


Not true at all.  A significant portion of revenue comes from tax receipts.  Are you aware of that fact?


Not by financial market participants, if interest rates are a good proxy for risk (hint:  they're one of the *best* proxies).  


Who cares? *It's business.*  I don't need somebody to like me in order to buy my products.  That they buy the product is evidence enough.

If the state can control it, then the usefulness of cryptocurrencies within a legal framework don't offer much more - if anything compelling - than traditional currencies and transactional regimes do.
If the state cannot control it, then the state will move to make its use so onerous as to limit the use of cryptocurrencies to black and grey market transactions.

Mistake   It would be wrong of you to think that any entity - centralized, distributed, or otherwise - could "control the economic cycle."  I think that's the dream of many, but it's simply unrealistic.  
Rather, the goal is to help *mitigate the effects of the business cycle.*  Sounds laudable to me.  
Regarding your questions:  If you have the most important one you'd like to ask, I'll give you an answer to it.  However, a realistic response to your list would require an asymmetrical dedication of time on my part, and would lead to excessive sharpshooting regarding this-that-and the other phrasing/wording.  For example, [here is an entire re-hashing of 'the money supply' question]( *from just one source.*  I'm not even going to try and re-explain it.  If there was something *specific* were were trying to get at, for a *specific reason*, then ask it.
*Moreover*, when you ask your most important question, be sure to include your rationale as to why using bitcoin/cryptocurrencies/Austrian theory would be the solution to that problem.

In other words, *totally contrived "facts"*.  **Specifically** the insistence on "finite supply", which is has until now been the realm of the goldbugs and the silver hoarders.
If I removed "cryptocurrency" and substituted "gold" for your entire argument, it would be indistinguishable from the arguments that goldbugs make.  
PS I do not "cling" to any fiat.  I'm paid in fiat; it's a medium through which value is transmitted to me from a counterparty, and it is almost immediately exchanged into something else.  I do not generally hold Dollars, Euros, Pounds, Dinars, Yen, Yuan or anything else.  I put my money into asset classes which have characteristics such as "stores of value," and "produce income."  
Honestly, these goldbug ("cryptocurrency") arguments are so tiring, because they often come from people who know just a little bit more than the average person about money and history, but just don't have the full story.

Here's my bottom line:  While all of this *seems* like a good idea to the few who "get it", it's really only a good idea if it's easily understood and accepted by the masses.  Until that point, intelligent people will recognize that the approach is all wrong and will work to rectify that - we will not get far with the claim that "they just need to work harder to 'get it' like we do."

Some of you people just don't get it.  Many of you won't *ever* get it.
The world didn't come up with "money" and, as part of the whole deal, decided to layer AML/KYC regulations, anti-fraud measures, time delays, etc. on it just for shits and giggles.
These things were layered on *in response to demonstrated behavior on the part of individuals to commit fraud.*
Bitcoin is money, plain and simple.  Given the lack of regulations, it's natural that the unsavory would flock to it.  It is precisely because of this that Bitcoin will not gain widespread adoption - that is, until there are the same sorts of protections available to both users and the governments of the world.  Those protective measures cost money.  Cost = fees &amp; time.  There is just no way around it.
You people who think that Bitcoin will keep its status as an unregulated conduit for money transfer are deluding yourselves.

Are you saying that the concept of interest - "the time value of money" - does not apply to bitcoin? That I can take out interest-free loans from people in bitcoin and owe no money?


For what, engaging in something illegal/fraudulent?  What is the risk there, by the way - that you won't be able to use your card and you'll be left to use hard currency?  Given that most credit accounts carry debit balances, it's not like anybody is keeping money from you.  And if you use BTC, isn't there a risk that "the internet isn't working?"  That's like an account freeze.

Honestly, you need to read up on this stuff.  That is not *at all*, *in any way*, how debt works.  
This is why I weep a little bit for It's full of people who believe the sorts of things that you just described - for example, that the coupon (interest payment) on fixed debt changes over time.
I'm wasting more time on this than I should, but a quick primer:
* Fixed rate debt:  The *coupon payment* ("interest payment") remains constant throughout the life of the loan.
* Floating rate debt:  The *coupon payment* varies throughout the life of the loan.
If the U.S. Treasury releases a 10 year note with a 10% interest rate (face value of $100), then the U.S. Treasury will pay the holder of that debt $10 per year ($5 2x per year) for 9 years; at the end of 10 years the Treasury will pay the holder the final $10 coupon plus $100 in the original principal.
During the *life* of that particular instrument, the *price* will change based on what the market will pay to own the debt (that is, for the right to receive the $10 coupon and final $100 principal payment).  If the price of the debt is $90, **I still get my $10 coupons.**  Because I'm getting a $10 coupon but I only paid $90 for the debt, the *yield* (this is the rate you're confused about) now rises to roughly 11.11% ($10/$90 = 11.11).  If, instead, the price of the debt rises to $110, then the yield will fall to 9.1% ($10/$110). 
Regardless of what the open market price of the 10 year is, or what the 10 year is *currently* yielding, the U.S. Treasury will continue to make the exact same $10 payment to the holder of that debt throughout the life of that security, period.  
Do you follow?  That's all I'm going to say on this subject.  If you're still confused, you need to read up further.

@_date: 2015-08-30 15:13:09
The interest rate doesn't move every day - at least not in the way you're thinking.
The *yield* on 10 year Treasuries changes.  As in, when the price changes and the fixed coupon remains...well, fixed - then the *yield* on that debt changes.
The *prevailing* 10-year rate is set via auction.  When the U.S. Treasury auctions off debt, the final price set at auction determines the fixed rate.  That rate (the coupon) remains fixed even though the *yield* will fluctuate through the life of the bond.
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:15:22
Screeds like this are all over the place.
Nominal rates might be at zero today ("unprecedented"), but real rates of return for longer-dated treasuries (10 years+) [were negative through several multi-year periods within recent history.](  No financial catastrophe then.

Exactly.  The rate is set at auction.  From that moment on, the Treasury will pay that coupon on that security for the remainder of the life of the debt.
