Wow, how many Sagan units is that?

Peet-za? What is this peet-za you speak of? This morning I ate gravel for breakfast.

Can you elaborate?

100 BTC is only $1.5m. That's only upper middle class. Ultra rich is billions.

Thank you for that comprehensive answer.

Nice strawman but this has literally nothing to do with my comment
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:08:21
Still not citizens so your point is moot and your splitting hairs is very autistic. Especially considering I included legal immigrants.

I just can't believe Trump chose Bitcoin as the official currency of Trump North America after the civil war
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:29:38
[Uh no they aren't]( and who even mentioned race? Oh yeah that was you, talking about black stereotypes. African-Americans are not immigrants, legal or otherwise, so that was a ridiculous example to begin with.
And for the record, I'm not even alt right. Or American for that matter.

What currency has coins worth 1/200th and 1/1000th of its base unit?

Maybe nodes could get a tiny fraction of the fees for every transaction they relay.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:33:46
Maybe they didn't, the dollar just increased?

Hahaha, do people really buy TV licenses? I've never had one. Anyway I have to go renew my kitchen knife and pork licenses so I can make a bacon sandwich.

Given the difficulty adjustment is once every two weeks, wouldn't it take that long for the confirmation rate to return to normal?
@_date: 2017-01-29 00:24:20
So is it theoretically possible to cause a "spiral of death" where the difficulty being too high causes the block interval to increase so much that the difficulty adjustment block is never reached? Why isn't the difficulty recomputed every block?
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:12:20
We've broken 3k before and it recently dropped to 1800. You can't really predict. It could be 0 tomorrow. Very unlikely but possible.

Illegal immigrants are not citizens by definition. In fact neither are legal immigrants.

There are a couple of sites where you can buy gift vouchers for sites like Amazon using bitcoin.

I bought a £1000 stake (all I could reasonably afford) and every time the price rises by about 20% I sell off the excess. If the price drops I will buy back in until I have £1000 again. This works for me because I don't have a regular income right now (student). I win whether the price goes up or down, provided it eventually goes back up.

I just want you to know that when I can afford my own wind turbine I'm totally stealing your idea of using renewable, basically-free energy to mine bitcoins

I had an unexpected expenditure and had to sell at 1800 and buy back at 2200 after initially buying in at 2400. But I just graduated CS and should be getting a decent job fairly soon.

Wouldn't the store just charge you based on the most up to date exchange rate? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:56:26
True, but I only just planted my money tree and have to wait for it to bloom.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:18:38
I mean I'm currently keeping the value of my bitcoins at £1000. When they are worth more, I sell. If it drops I buy back. I bought 1.3 BTC for £1000 and I currently have around 0.6 which is still worth about £1000. I've made about £600 or so. It's true that if I held on to it, I would have more, but for a guy with no income, making £600 with zero effort in a few weeks is pretty good. When I graduate and get a job I'll HODL properly.

Ok my bad.

You can't say 'f&gt;g' but you can say 'f(x)&gt;g(x)' for some or all values of x.
@_date: 2016-07-24 15:45:27


Yes you can.
