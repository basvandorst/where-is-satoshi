I remember those days.

I have about 24 of these devices (several different iteration of it) but haven't done anything with them yet, so I'm not too familiar.  Do they have any EEPROM?   Sure, please do upstream the message, that would be cool!  I think collective minds make things better!
I can't wait to build one up tonight.   I'll set one up with a battery, solar panel and charge controller/voltage regulator and mount it on my roof!

Awesome idea!  I have a drawer full of these, I'm going to give this a try tonight.

Well I do!  So if doesn't, I'd be happy to make a trade!

If you think about it, most people have never heard of, or bought BTC.  Many people have heard of it, I suppose, but most people haven't bought into it at all.   As more people buy, the supply will go down and the demand will go up.

I also looked into this... it does seem simple enough.  EEPROMs only have so many writes before they wear out, but I don't think a device like this will be reconfigured too often!  Fun!

If you did build a basic page that lets you configure it, and added a way to reset it (like short a couple pins on start up) you could sell these as stand-alone appliances, for people with no tech skills whatsoever!   Though it complicates things significantly compared to your simple implementation here.

Do you mean you'd pay about 0.00729 for one?

This official statement only further cements my thoughts and position on Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.  He's threatened by it.

That's a great idea too, embed it into a wall socket.  Could also benefit from being in a little case with a USB connector, like a dongle that can be plugged in anywhere.

*That* is where I see the biggest risk.

Yes, thank you!  I modified the readme really quick, and left your bitcoin address in there, gave you credit, acknowleged that I forked it, and mentioned what I changed to make it work for USD.   I also removed the icons (though I like them, I have a desktop environment that I'll monitor this from that uses text only).  I also changed the error message "Hodl on, something's wrong!"  because  I thought that would be fun to reference a BTC meme. 
It might be better if you just added 3x variables to let people choose EUR, USD, or GBP, that will give people universal access to their locale. 
I'll install this tonight!   I'm excited to try it!
