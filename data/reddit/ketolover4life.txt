Well coinbase and blockchain said it was sent, and that's why I paid him via PayPal that moment. I've never had a pending send not confirm.
If I have to dispute the CC / PayPal charge I will, I was hoping to not have to do that though, I'd obviously prefer to own the coin.

I hold bitcoin and was buying a friend's small amount to help him out financially. I keep all of mine on a trezor. If you can't amass more, then this coin is doomed.

I posted the transaction info above - not sure what proof you're asking about. It's a personal friend of mine, Im trying to avoid a credit card charge back on him which would hurt him, that's all.

I felt bad for a friend who needed money, I paid him via PayPal and I'm not even sure he has the wallet on his phone anymore. If I dispute the CC/PayPal - it will devastate him financially. 
I won't give away free money though either -

It is what is - bought in at 4,5,7,9,15, and 18.
I just do buys every time I get paid, kind of like mutual funds. The mutual funds sometimes go down, but they always recover and go higher - have been for many years with me buying them.

Truth to your words. 10 years into my career with 401k matching @ vanguard and I have a nice 180k retirement fund with 20 more years. I start a new position with my company Jan 2nd, 10% increase in salary and have 20 more working years left if I want to retire at 60. I expect the 401k to grow substantially.

Had mine set to 7500 for buying more. I buy some beginning and mid month, not much 50$ each, but it adds up. Saw 7.6k and said fuck it and bought. Happy I did.

Cost averaging... I decided to get in a month or two ago and just buy little bits on pay day. 20$ here, 30$ there. 
Just the amounts I would spend on a shit meal and drink out and about. I'm up to 280$ usd worth so it does add up.
Just bought a trezor last night too. Should be here next week sometime.
