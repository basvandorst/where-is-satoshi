For years and years the local children had talked about the old house on the hill. Its worn exterior and isolated location made the perfect setting for their ghost stories. The old man that inhabitated the house, with his wrinkly appearance and secretive nature, only added fuel to their imagination.
"I heard he is a vampire" said one child. "I heard he is the devil himself" said another.  "Werewolf!" "Serial killer!" And on and on they would speculate amongst themselves about the house and its occupant. There was one boy who knew the truth however.
Dorian wasn't like the other children. He preferred to spend his time reading books or exploring the forest behind his school.  The other kids didn't like him and to be honest he didn't like them either. He had met the man that lived in the old house on the hill and knew he wasn't a vampire or a werewolf or anything else the other children had thought he was.
"I'll give your ball back and answer a couple of questions if you promise to do me a favor kid" the old man had said to Dorian. "Ok" replied Dorian. "I don't want you to tell your friends anything about me. As long as they think I'm a monster or killer or whatever, they'll stay away and I can have my privacy."
Dorian looked at his shoes for a while then returned his gaze to the old man. "Do you have a name sir?" Dorian asked as politely as he could. "Sato....Mr Nakamoto" the old man said furrowing his brow. "Where do you come from Mr Nakamoto?" said Dorian eyes wide in anticipation of the answer.  The man looked Dorian up and down and held the ball out to him with a intense stare across his face. "It does not matter where I am from. What matters is where I am going." Dorian reached out and took the ball and slowing started pacing backwards. When he had gotten some steps back he mustered up the courage to ask one final question. "W..Whe..Where are you going?" 
The old man erupted into a huge belly laugh and lifted his arms to the sky and shouted "To the moon!"
The End

Are the answers normally without spaces?  for example could be: "what is needed is an electronic..." or "whatisneededisanelectronic...". Spaces or no spaces changes the whole scope of the answer and should be disclosed.

This is probably a controversial thing to say, but I think these exchanges getting hacked is a good thing. It adds little marks to Bitcoins history that others can learn from.
