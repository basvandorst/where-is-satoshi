Once again, different implications. Mt.Gox processed almost all Bitcoin liquidity then. If a large exchange went down now it would rock the market, but it woulden’t have the same gravity as Mt.Gox in 2013/14.

There’s probably 50 - 100 projects in total with actual real world potential. The rest are money grabs, scams and knock offs.

Yeah well selling at a loss will do that won’t it. Shouldn’t have sold.

Highly highly doubt we’ll see a 2 year bear. The games changed since 2014, it’s not the same environment, not even remotely.

You think the blockchain revolution will be confined to 8 projects.. across all the industry applications, all the team, talent and capital going to this amounts to 8 winners? If so, geee we gotta a great future to look forwards too, conglomerates being replaced with super conglomerates.

Ummm calling altcoins “worthless” is a gross oversimplification. Your going to have to look a little closer. Vast majority are garbage, but certainly not all of them.

No, it’ll go up again because it has the worlds attention, and is beginning to be taken seriously as an asset class. Think about it this way, your billionaire, you have at your disposal the best technical analysts on Wall Street. Stick with me, now along comes a market that doesn’t fall under a single countries jurisdiction, is open 24/7, is predominantly occupied by retail investors, and has such low liquidity compared to global capital markets that it can be manipulated easily. That’s is literally every market makers wet dream. It’s not a matter of believing bitcoin will “over throw the bankers, or destroy the financial system” if you believe that, then you don’t know anything about economics or finance. It will grow because it can be manipulated, huge financial institutions see the possibility of making large returns, the majority of whom fail to outperform the S&amp;P500 on a regular annual basis. It’s a matter of time and patience for the capital to flow in, and yes, it’ll be manipulated in both directions, the more firms playing the game, larger the volume, the less receptive it becomes to manipulation, the more capital is required, the more it’ll grow.

Now that I agree with, tether being a crux or inter-exchange liquidity is bad. Stable coins (DAI) and DEXs (AirSwap, Kyber, 0x) will no doubt only increase in market significance. It’s the next logical step.

Will probably boost 6-12 months after the halving. Everyone will be in anticipation of the halving so it’s immediate market effect will already be factored.

If a global recession on the scale of the GFC occurs, trust me, speculative assets with little current use will be the last thing you want to hold.

Impossible now, too many massive miners, can’t overpower them all at once now.

I agree, BTC’s trend line is going to take us to 6, we haven’t seen the blood yet

Yeah but disintermediation is the next logical step in improving market efficiency. Assume people renting their places out have the same assurance as AirBnB provides, why wouldn't they opt for a decentralized alternative that provides them with 20-30% more profit simply by cutting out AirBnB?

Important to remember not all Alts are coins, don’t discount everything without due research.
