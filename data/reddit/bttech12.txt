Bro c'mon. I shouldn't even respond, but that post has all the hallmarks of a troll: off topic, nonsensical, and trying to discredit bitcoin. Call me paranoid but I know what goes on in this subreddit. Why can't you post something on-topic? Maybe you should go back to goldman sachs subreddit where they throw some lizard coin your way for being a nuisance?

On the surface the idea sounds crazy, but we are already slaves to human employers if you really think about it. Bots have no emotions and could actually serve to be a better employer than your current one... _Or_ it could be a _really_ bad situation too, I see that yes.  As long as these bots are open source, transparent, and the humans programming them are unscrupulous I see no problem. 
Also if they aren't turing complete the likelihood that they are ever smart enough to do serious damage (like take over the world lol), is extremely unlikely. Yeah I know, crazy stuff. But it warrants investigation, Ai, bots, robots are here to stay my friend.
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:25:30
Actually nvm! this could be validated by an api from a humans smartwatch.
Edit. But why would a bot pay a human to lose weight? Thats a pretty altruistic bot haha.
@_date: 2016-04-18 09:13:10
Dude stop trollin. Personally I'd rather have a bot employer than human employer that gives me sh*t all day. Think outside your little box; Bots, Ai, Robots are the future workforce because they lower cost. Its just cheaper that way, what do you think they will be transacting with? Dollars? No way, hopefully they will be transacting with Bitcoin and not some goldman sachs lizard coin.
*EDIT* this reply came across meaner than intended.

"Noone can take bitocins from you." oh so you really believe that? What if that court held you in contempt for not releasing your private key? If it was serious enough they would hold you indefinitely. Also what is a bitocin?
@_date: 2016-04-18 12:33:48
lol go away troll.
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:23:53
What do you mean by this? Also how would these instances IRL be verifiable online? To prevent fraud.
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:15:25
Interesting idea, prob the most unique so far. What about bots paying other bots to deliver something from point a to point b? Not IRL, but on the internet. I'm not exactly sure what I mean by this, I'm just brainstorming here, but I think the greatest potential for this is bots paying other bots to do work. I should've reworded my title.
So expanding on this a bit, what needs to be delivered from point a to point b that is achieved more efficiently by a bot than a human? Prob. spam for one, but what other legal things could it do?

Mike Hearn talked about this concept he called tradenet (1), it has alot of similarities to what youre talking about.
@_date: 2016-04-18 09:02:02
I've done some thinking about this and came to the conclusion that it would be wayyy too risky. Heres why:
This bank would essentially be open season, not just for hackers but also for intelligence agencies to screw with. If they can't find you then they'll just jack you. 
Also it is unlikely that you would be able to garner enough talent to secure the damn thing.

Also not contracts "on" humans, contracts to humans. You can still not accept them if you want! Lol!

For some reason it just came out that way.

You know what, sometimes I feel the same way. But thats not going to stop the force behind technology. I've came to the conclusion that instead of fighting we need to embrace responsible, open sorce technology thats verifiable. Only then can we be sure that this type of tech doesn't backfire.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:13:24
I like where youre headed and this was the type of ideas--that actually had a business model--that I wanted to talk about. Even though, I don't think ai is anywhere near the ability to judge code integrity, that would be cool nonetheless. I'm sure we will see that happen sometime, and if it does that could fundamentally change computing. Really that topic deserves its own post I think. 3,333 bits @_date: 2016-04-18 17:14:43
no this is totally true. the rest of your post is disgusting tho.
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:49:07
I probably should've reworded my title a bit, the real opportunity here is bots paying other bots to work like you said! What industry needs a bot to pay another bot for work though is my question. Thinking about this a bit, one of the industries that could benefit are crypto currency exchanges. Bots already operate on them, this is a known fact. On the positive side they provide liquidity for the market.
Amazon operates mechanical turks, the humans on there don't even score better than machines according to studies. Thats another industry that could benefit.
@_date: 2016-04-18 12:30:41
Well, Bitcoins blockchain achieved all that and provided a blueprint. I don't see terms, software, timing, costs as a limiting factor at all. If bitcoin can come to consensus between people who don't trust each other, why can't a private consortium?
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:47:32
Good question. Those "electronic" currencies aren't programmable for one, one of the great things about bitcoin are the unique financial instruments that it can offer. _Smart contracts_ for example would allow humans and machines to enter into agreements that could be legally binding without a third party, and funds automatically be released upon completion of a task. This would lower the cost of doing business globally.
@_date: 2016-04-18 17:21:34
Bitcoin is _programmable_ money, thats what really makes it so cool. I believe the industry that will benefit the most are ai/bots. For the first time ever they can participate in the internet economy; for better or worse, you will be assimilated ;)

Hey no prob, pass the good vibes on. 
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:33:09
Also I don't think this is _that_ futuristic. If you didn't hear Microsoft just came out with a bot framework(1) and they're already invested in blockchain tech(2). We could see something like this really soon.

That 21 million can be subdivided into 6 quindecillion bits though without running into trouble. And if thats the case then it will be the most liquid currency on the earth. Not exactly something Id want as a buy and hold investment. 
I think a lot of people when they buy into bitcoin don't realize this. Regardless of that unpleasant fact, Im still bullish because I see Bitcoin/Blockchain as a *platform* not just a currency/public ledger. Platforms tend to reward early adopters, just look at Youtube as a prime example.

So far according to my calculations you would make around $-70.00 each year using an Intel i7 core processor. Sound about right?
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:35:01
Thanks I know, but I'm just doing some research right now do you know where I can find the answer?
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:26:30
You forgot a pretty important one however, trilightzone.org. They're pretty secretive but were mentioned in one of the snowden docs that it gives the NSA trouble. If you're interested in seeing I'll look for the doc.

It would be all too convenient if this WAS a conspiracy. No lets not shy away from facing hard truths: like, Mike is right on a lot of fronts.

This is a pretty awesome track, and I was surprised since I've never heard of these guys. They didn't really go into Bitcoin--or crypto regardless-- though to warrant a track called "Satoshi Nakamoto". Disappointing.

I know this is a very broad question, but what, in your opinion, are the coolest OP codes in the Bitcoin scripting language? Which ones are the most exciting/have the most potential for "cool" implementations?!

Doesn't seem like Satoshi's style to criticize the lead dev's in public. However, the author does have a good point: 2 devs single-handedly forking Bitcoin does seem to violate the spirit of the protocol.

if Bitcoins production is halved every 4 years to compensate for Moore's Law, then if demand stays the same price should rise right?
Would it be fair to assert that the price of Bitcoin is aligned with Moore's Law then? Of course there are going to be a multitude of factors effecting its price but for arguments sake lets just focus on this part.

no doubt about it, I've had some of the worst customer experiences on Coinbase. Not only did it seem like they were treating me like a criminal throughout their lengthy identification process, but they misrepresented how fast buying Bitcoin could be. It took over a month to get a limit increase and by that time any gains in price that could have been locked in were forfeited. 
The ONLY thing Coinbase has got going for them is a superior UI and that it isnt a scam. I only do business with Coinbase because there is NO BETTER OPTION.
