Because difficulty adjusts according to profitability, you must assume that mining is an almost break even activity, and that almost all coins mined are sold.
The exchange volume is just coins trading back and forth between people. The new coins being sold is what drags the price down.
You say that statistic is not very useful, well it was useful for me to stay out of Bitcoin when it literally costed a $billion per year just to maintain the price.
@_date: 2015-06-07 10:05:52
By purchasing Bitcoin you're just hoping that other enough people buy enough bitcoin after you to pay for the costs of mining.

I get what youre saying, but you do agree though dont you that if the community actually agreed to do this, it would probably cause a huge bubble to $2000? Instead we have to wait years and years for the inflation to end whilst Krugman laughs at us.

Youre totally correct. Ive been in fiat since early 2014 and havent regretted it.

Why doesnt he get specific? Of course altcoins with cute dogs on them arent going anywhere, hes not talking about Doge, hes aiming his finger at Ripple obviously.
Ripple has made great strides working with banks giving rise to a very impressive market cap. Why has that happened? Because Bitcoin doesnt serve that need (trading fiat backed IOUs) and its technical design flaws dont allow it to (mining makes it too slow to be a decentralized exchange).
So clearly Ripple "works" and it cant be considered just an altcoin, so he should be more specific about saying what does and doesnt work.
He should stop claiming other people's stuff doesnt work and focus on the reason why Bitcoin isnt working for everybody.
Disclaimer: I dont own any Ripple although I wish I did.

I agree with you but what's the alternative? You probably benefited from state-funded education before you were old enough to get a job. And that education meant you werent limited to working as a barman (Im just guessing here).
Also what about healthcare? The US hasnt exactly demonstrated a good model for how everyone can access healthcare regardless of personal income. Maybe just a bit of state-theft (socialist NHS) is better than people being at the mercy of insurance companies because of a "pre-existing condition".
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:58:43
I dont care what some keynesian economists think is good for "stimulating the economy". Im interested in cryptocurrency because I want a good store of value and conducive to personal freedom. I dont want my savings to be a government lever to manipulate me into spending instead of saving.
Bitcoin is obviously not deflationary enough, which is why it sank over the last 18 months.

Why should we wait till then? There's no technical reason why we cant end the subsidy right now with a hard fork. Mining could still go on with transaction fees, which would become much more valuable if everyone knows that no more coins are being created.
Why should we continue issuing coins for the next 100 years?

@_date: 2014-12-30 20:19:14
Ok I mispoke there is some risk in times of high volatility. But short positions have to post at least 200% collateral. So as long as BitShares does not lose 50% of its value *really* quickly, they will cover their position and buy-back BitUSD. The shorter will face a margin call much sooner than that, i.e. when 66% (IIRC) of his collateral is required to cover.

We could of course start using decentralized exchanges like BitSharesX. It lets you trade pegged derivatives like BitUSD and BitBTC.
It has zero risk of any managers running off with your money because you can trade on the blockchain directly from your own wallet.

@_date: 2014-10-25 00:02:13
Have you tried the client?
I day trade on the value of the shares. A few days ago the price had a little rally so I wanted to lock in my profits so I bought a few thousand BitUSD. Then when the share value corrected itself I sold the BitUSD for a nice little increase in shares.
The whole experience was freaking awesome. It was liberating to actually trade my shares without sending them to Bitstamp or whoever.
BitSharesX is an exchange, and a very trustworthy one because you dont have to trust any operators, just open source code.
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:31:43
If you want to get paid interest from holding Bitcoin, you can hold BitBTC instead.
Its an asset on the BitShares blockchain that is pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin. Users who short BitBTC pay interest to those who buy BitBTC.
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:12:11
BitBTC is exactly what it says it is - its a crypto currency pegged to the value of Bitcoin. The market for BitBTC is a bit thin at the moment so its spread is a bit big, but the peg does work.
BitUSD on the otherhand has very high volume so the spread is tiny.
BitSharesX also allows you to directly trade between the pegged assets, but that market is again a bit thin for the moment.
If you understand that the BitBTC &amp; BitUSD pegs work, then you will get that we finally have trustless BTC/USD trading.
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:07:37
Bitshares is not centralized. There are 101 delegates - way more than there are big mining pools.

BitGold isnt backed by gold, its pegged to gold using a blockchain exchange. When the shorters are matched with the buyers, then a BitUSD is created. The shorter has to buy back BitUSD before 30 days or when he is making a loss, which destroys the bitUSD.
@_date: 2014-09-28 15:24:10
To call Bitcoin a healthy, non-inflating currency is absurd.
Bitcoin is inflationary to the tune of $600 million/year. And miners are forced to sell that new currency to pay for electricity etc.
You want dividends from your crypto-assets, not inflation.
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:06:16
I wonder what Paul Krugman thinks about BitShares X - it gives you the option of BitUSD - a more reliable store of value, as well as not having any mining costs so shareholders get dividends.
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:06:53
If russians want to safely protect their dollar savings, buying BitUSD seems to be a better option, depending on whether you can stomach the volatility or not.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:24:37
With BitShares there is no risk of a Counterparty not paying you the collateral for your BitUSD/BitGold. The peg has been working for months now.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:56:34
This is on the BitShares blockchain.
Before you dismiss it, the point of BitShares is that its meant to replace more of those centralized services that you still rely on with Bitcoin - for example you still have to go into Fiat on a centralized exchange to trade Bitcoin. BitShares gives you BitUSD directly on the blockchain.
This is another example of decentralizing things - identity management.
@_date: 2014-10-25 16:34:39
What makes you think the network is not already strong enough? The bitcoin network is already paying for security to the tune of about $500 million per year.

I already have swapped all my BTC for Bitshares. I want dividends from profitable companies, not inflation. Not regretting it one bit.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:23:30
Your USD that you hold in your bank account is an IOU from the bank saying that they will give you 1 USD worth of value when you ask for it. In reality the bank only has fractional reserves, meaning if all the customers at your bank decided to spend their money at the same time, there would be a run on the bank.
Compare that with BitUSD - its a promise to get 1 USD worth of BitShares. The key difference is that its backed up by 300% collateral - 100% from the buyer and 200% from the shorter of BitUSD. That promise is enforced by the blockchain running on open source code.
So tell me now - which system is the IOU?
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:33:55
My question: how can Counterparty enforce the rules of a contract that affect Bitcoin balances if that contract is just random blockchain data/spam according to the Bitcoin protocol? Isnt this the same fundamental flaw that Mastercoin had?

Hi Gavin. What do you think of BitUSD ?

@_date: 2014-09-22 20:21:25
Great video. I agree it sure would be nice if that $600 million per year went to the existing share holders instead of to electricity companies and asic manufacturers.

The peg is working very well:
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:40:05
What if block producers were elected by the stake holders to sign blocks in a deterministic order? They could then sign the blocks for free. They would still need to be incentivized to not miss blocks (getting fired would do it), but you wouldnt have the same huge costs as with mining.
A set of banks who wanted to create a payment network blockchain could do something like that. They dont strictly need 100% decentralization.

Im guessing he means lending out his Bitcoin with interest to other users on the exchange who want to buy Bitcoin with leverage or short sell it. This is what Bitfinex supports.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:30:15
I meant proportional to your stake. You dont have to use your keys so
cold storage is fine.
Anyway like I said destroying fees is actually better for tax purposes than interest. But mining cant do that, it has to issue new coins instead.
I dont think its a stretch to call bitcoin wasteful - it requires $300 million of new fiat to buy into bitcoin per year just to keep the price stable. Thats why Krugman can safely laugh at it.
DPOS does not suffer from Nothing at Stake.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:51:33
Dude have an open mind. Do you really think there will only ever be 1 blockchain?
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:21:36
So because it doesnt use Bitcoin's massively expensive hashing, that means Ethereum is centralized?
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:39:12
BitShares is decentralized, and uses a median of the price feeds to support the peg.
@_date: 2015-05-15 23:11:22
DPoS definitely is just as secure for a billionth of the cost. It doesnt suffer from the nothing at stake problem.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:47:12
That graph shows it is working. If the peg wasnt holding you would see people dumping their BitBTC for e.g. 50% of the price of BTC. That isnt happening.
The fluctuations you are seeing are caused by low volume. Once that increases, the peg will be tighter.
Do you honestly think a CFD on a blockchain is impossible to do?

"We are still in the early years of Bitcoin, where adoption will outpace the growth in supply"
No you have it the wrong way round - the era when adoption really was outpacing growth in supply was 2009-2013. It's now 2014 and the reverse is true. Adoption increase is now less than $600 million, and therefore the price is plummeting.
The point is that if the block validation was free, the amount of new money needed per year to sustain the price would actually be far less than $600 million - it could be almost zero.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:03:11
DPOS makes use of an existing distribution of stakeholders to form consensus.
It is used to pay delegates as well, if thats what you mean by distribution.
No fiat is involved.
@_date: 2015-05-17 14:05:25
Not if there are more delegates than big mining pools, which there are.
@_date: 2015-05-06 09:13:52
Yes and that includes trusted 3rd parties like Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:11:53
Yes it is. Realistically you would have to scam 100% of all the stake holders to control every single delegate.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:35:46

Bitfinex liquidity providers charge interest to other users wanting to short Bitcoin or buy it with leverage. Is Bitfinex a ponzi?
BitUSD's interest is exactly the same. Shorters compete to offer the highest interest to buyers of BitUSD.

Prove it! In DPOS you vote in the block producers. If they dont do their job they get fired. 101 delegates &gt; 5 mining pools. How is that centralized?

@_date: 2015-05-03 16:20:35

DPOS is not affected by the nothing-at-stake problem.
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:51:25
The order is based on when they were elected (I think), so you can only manipulate the order if you can control 51% of the stake (which no system can tolerate).
Even if you manipulate the order, there are 101 delegates so at least 1 honest one will include transactions that were missed from the last block.
All of the things youre saying have trivial solutions. Delegates can be anonymous for example and dont have to reveal their IP address, so how do they get DDoS'd ?
Ironically the only entity that can get DDoS'd is mining pools because they are centralized points that have to advertise themselves.

But realistically there wont be two chains. These two developers should agree before a fork happens.
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:48:10
Why are you so convinced that Bitcoin will be the only successful blockchain?
FACT: Mining is not required to secure a blockchain.
FACT: DPOS is not affected by the Nothing at Stake problem.
FACT: Bitcoin's expenses are higher than its transaction fees. "Network effect" does not negate the laws of economics.
There will be other equally decentralized blockchains that will have a better ratio of transaction fees (income) to expenses. At that point network effect wont mean squat, Bitcoin will not be the only blockchain worth holding anymore. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 22:30:38
The thing I want to get is whatever decreases in supply. I want a blockchain that is deflationary at 5%/year.
@_date: 2015-05-03 14:46:23
You can compare the two. DPOS is more secure in 1 block than mining is in 6 confirmations.
1 DPOS block cannot be reversed, because 101 delegates have a predetermined order that they are required to sign blocks in. Whereas a bitcoin transaction can theoretically be unspent by a fork from someone with 51% of the hashing power.
Add to that DPOS is basically free, whereas mining's costs is dragging down the price of BTC.

If 10 delegates in a row (they have to be consecutive to delay anything) all collude to miss a transaction, the 11th one will include it - big deal. Collusion just isnt going to work as those 10 delegates will get found out and fired.
Some are anonymous, some have campaigned for a position based on their contribution to developing the system etc.
DPOS proves that you CAN have a secure decentralized blockchain without an expensive token of value. The stake itself doesnt have to have any monetary value.

Efficiency is defined in this case as (Block security / New coins issued).
If a blockchain's protocol uses a concensus mechanism that does not need to issue new coins, you could say it is more efficient than one that needs to issue 25 new coins every 10 minutes, thereby bringing down the price and destroying value for the stakeholders.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:06:46
How often do you actually want to convert to dollars?
Surely you want to stay in crypto for as long as possible. As youre bullish on Bitcoin long term, you mostly only sell into dollars in a bubble in the hope that you can buy back more.
Thats me anyway. BitUSD is perfect for that. Freedom to trade with no counterparty risk.

Individuals can break their promises. The rules of the blockchain ties up collateral from the shorts, and unless the rules change that promise wont be broken.
For the BitBTC peg to shown to work, each BitBTC's value must be equal (or slightly greater) to the value of each BTC, which is the case.
Thank you for that graph, it actually helps my case not yours. It does fluctuate according to the value of the underlying collateral, but that is to be expected and is not an issue.
But yeah don't let the facts get in the way of your personal biases.

Interest is payed by shorters of BitUSD to the holders. Shorters have put up 200% colleteral - hardly fractional.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:18:48
Yes and pay attention to the fact that as BitShares dropped, the blockchain forced margin calls and bought back &amp; destroyed BitUSD. With the result being that even after BitShares dropped, BitUSD is still collateralized at 222%.

No it is just one method of securing a blockchain. Mining was invented in 2008 and there has been lots of research into other ways since then.
For example BitShares has invented the Delegated Proof of Stake system, which actually reduces the share/coin supply instead of increasing it: 
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:26:52
He does make some good points about the costs of mining dragging the price down. If we had a blockchain whose transaction fee income was greater than its confirmation expenses, then more people would take crypto currency seriously.
.i.e Bitcoin is currently like a company that is making a $400 million annual loss (at $300/btc). The only reason to hold it is because you think other people will buy and pay the mining costs.
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:29:34
Im not talking about altcoins and im not selling you anything. Im just saying that you can have secure decentralized blockchains WITHOUT the huge costs of mining.
You said "DPOS directly supports centralization.", which is just a statement without any proof. DPOS just secures a blockchain for free.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:49:22
All collateral provided by shorters is locked away by the blockchain until the short position is closed.
If all BitUSD is collateralized 222%, then by definition there is enough collateral to buy back all BitUSD in existance.

Many years ago Gavin created a faucet and gave away 10000 BTC, IIRC. Is a carefully managed faucet any less fair? What if Satoshi had designed the protocol using DPOS and just gave away all the 21 million coins from a faucet? He could still have given the coins away in stages if he wanted to. The point is that if the coins are issued IPO-style instead of expensively mined, then there is no downward pressure on the price.
Also, the fact that in ~2100 we will reach the limit of 21 million coins is basically irrelevant to the downward pressure on price today.
I do agree with you that the ability to mine coins in 2011 on your CPU was exciting, and kickstarted interest in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:09:04
Your post shows a complete lack of understanding of how Delegated Proof of Stake works. In DPOS a larger stake does NOT affect how your stake grows - it only affects how you can vote for the delegates that sign blocks. In BitShares your stake stays the same till you trade/send it.
And yes, DPOS solves the 'nothing at stake' problem.
It doesnt matter if its "fair" or not - mining is destroying the value of your stake. Thats why I dont want to hold Bitcoin. I want to hold something that decreases in supply not increases.
@_date: 2015-01-25 14:51:33

This post is so dumb. When mining was generating 50 BTC every 10 minutes, (in 2012) the price hadnt even reached $100 yet. So it was much easier for smaller amounts of money to increase the price. The higher the price gets, the more mining drags it down.
Mining is entirely the reason why Bitcoin is not exploding.
@_date: 2015-01-04 20:18:11
It will stop in ~2100 when all coins are mined. Why wait that long? Why dont we send crypto to the moon now? Vote with your wallet for the system that makes the most economic sense. Expecting new money to come in after yours to prop up the price makes no sense for you as a BTC holder.

Here is my prediction: Bitcoin will hover around the $300-400 range because throughout 2015 it will continue to inflate at 10%, all new coins of course given to miners who have to sell to pay their costs as usual.
The block reward creates a ceiling that caps the maximum sustainable price. Bitcoin will not see another huge rally until 2016 when the block reward halves. Until then I will keep my money in "altcoins" that reward me with dividends not inflation.

Very interesting reply I learnt a lot from that.
So the Fed's ability to print money is limited not by their gold supply (which is something fixed) but by their return on bonds and mortgages (which can be unlimited). Isnt that basically just an elaborate scheme designed to give the illusion of "backing"? US economy grows -&gt; more taxes collected -&gt; Treasury can sell more bonds in return for Fed notes -&gt; Fed has more "assets" -&gt; Fed therefore can issue more Fed notes. Its a never ending spiral of increasing numbers.
Its interesting how the Fed holding MBS gives them an incentive to always provide low rates to jack up the housing market.

Merchant receives payment for services, has to pay tax on the profit he made on that service at the time of sale. Bitcoin falls 50%, merchant still has to pay the same amount of tax in a $ cost basis, which could be greater than the value of his BTC.

And thats why until I see evidence to the contrary, I will assume that the number of merchants that choose to take that risk is tiny.

There are other methods - go and find them. Expand your knowledge.

Users pay a fee to become a standby delegate, and then stakeholders vote them in the top 101 active delegate positions. Many of the delegates are voted in to do real work to develop the infrastructure etc (instead of burning electricity).

If there are 100 sidechains with their own rules, doesnt the BTC blockchain have to validate all those other rules? The peg is not going to hold when people successfully get their BTC back plus their sidechain tokens.
Also it seems that the bitcoin script to unlock the spent BTC would have to be controlled by a centralized thirdparty, unless the bitcoin blockchain itself was validating the sidechain like I said.

What "tactics" are you referring to? He wants to use blockchains for more than currency. Why does that make you feel so insecure?
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:23:20
Yeah and thats because Bitcoin itself is not profitable. All the profits are made by supporting infrastructure companies like BitStamp, or miners who try to extract as much $ as they can by burning electricity.
If BitStamp's business model (and thereby profits) were moved onto the blockchain itself, then holding Bitcoin might actually be profitable. 
I might buy Bitcoin again in May 2016 when the block reward halves. Until then Ill wait for more coins to be dumped by miners.
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:53:00


So when you say "mining" are you referring to incentivizing with new coins etc (by whatever method), and not necessarily just the first method of burning electricity to do it. So wouldnt it be more accurate to say "cant have blockchains without incentives", rather than "cant have blockchains without Bitcoin". ?

What dividends does Facecoin give? If its a profitable asset then I might want to own some.
No reason why shares cant be transmittable like currency.
Saying things are "premined" is just another idiot argument to convince people the only crypto they should hold is bitcoin - a loss making network.

Instead of saying "Premined", you could say they gave out their tokens to everyone who invested &amp; built their company. Whats wrong with that?
I have 0 Ripple, but rewarding people for mining is stupid, when burning electricity is not the only way to secure a blockchain.
@_date: 2015-04-22 11:56:29
Is mining the only acceptable way to circulate blockchain tokens?
No, so stop calling it premined. You didnt contribute to Ripple's infrastructure, so you have zero of its shares.

1) Pretty much. Downvote everything thats not The One blockchain.
2) Because it cant - BitShares can only control its own blockchain. If you want the BitShares innovations to go into Bitcoin you need to convince Gavin to accept them. Until then BitShares will innovate on its own blockchain.

You say that as if its clever, but you know what they mean. Its the transparency of the people using it that is lacking, not the technology itself.

If you are lending out BTC, you need to require collateral (e.g. USD) of sufficient amount to cover the loan. That would then be a safe way to make interest.

The intrinsic value of Bitcoin should come from whether it is a profitable asset as opposed to running at a loss, otherwise there will be other blockchains that emerge with better economics.

You can only vote if you have shares. And every vote requires a transaction fee (0.1 BTS). The fee to become a standby delegate (needed to be voted in) is something in the order of 10000 BTS. So Im not sure your attack vector will work.
Btw this is also worth looking at - trading without counterparty risk:

Would it have been fair to say that nuclear fission was a "null hypothosis" in the 1930s when no one had figured out how to make it practical? - Is fusion today a null hypothesis? There is a big difference between things that no one has finished yet and things which are scientifically provable to be impossible like perpetual motion machines. But sure go ahead and generalize everything.
Some banks probably have a prototype blockchain up &amp; running right now - theyve been talking about it for ages. You could also consider Ripple as an example of a private blockchain that banks find useful for financial clearing.
I bet those banks that make $millions in efficiency savings wont care if you approve or not. Of course, you would approve if banks used the Bitcoin blockchain but its way to slow for that.

These delegates are elected to sign blocks:  Its very transparent.

Exactly. The IOU on Ripple is exactly the same as your $ in your Bitstamp account. Bitstamp needed this feature otherwise they wouldnt agree to be a Ripple gateway.

Some people doubted fission could be accomplished until it was.
Ripple can be used as a private blockchain, and banks find it useful (Loads of press on this) which blows out your dogma that private blockchains can never work.
No one in the real financial world cares about Bitcoin. They are just looking to harness the idea behind it, with lots of success. That fact really seems to be really unpalatable.

As I understood the blocklist was a list of addresses that are well-known for various "spammy" activities like gambling. But anyway...
What about the idea that every paid transaction is a form of income for the network, and you should be encouraging as many people as possible to make a transaction, whatever their own use case for it is? Surely you want to maximize the transaction fee revenue collected by the blockchain? What do you think of that?
Btw anyone who maintains any linux distro is awesome :)

Heres an idea: why not pay Gavin for his great work by issuing new coins to him instead of to miners.
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:02:37
The delegate registration fee is burned giving an implicit dividend to everyone else. The paid fee is recorded into the blockchain, allowing everyone else to vote for that new standby delegate.
It would be great if Bitcoin transaction fees were burned as well, unfortunately the mining algorithm is so expensive that even the fees dont cover it, it has to issue new coins instead.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:09:24
"proof is up to the claimants not the skeptics" Yes and you are the one who made the bold claim about private blockchains not working. It just needs one example to show that it can, and all the banks are saying that it will be very useful to them in terms of efficiencies in financial clearing. 
They are not talking about private blockchains because they feel threatened by by some puny $3billion virtual currency. Dont flatter yourself.
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:47:26

Of course they want a fiat peg, thats why this thread started. Its also why people keep BTC on exchanges, they want to quickly be able to go into dollar stability during a bubble and sell dollars for BTC afterwards. Crypto is more convenient than fiat dollars.
Innovation is useless? Just wait till BitShares leaves the startup phase and becomes profitable.

Do you measure it by market cap? Lets say an alternative crypto reaches a market cap of $300 million, then what? The G man comes in an shuts it down how exactly? If that crypto really is deflationary then even arresting all the developers wont stop people using it and wanting to hold it.
