Pretty much. The bitcoin network distributes ALL the data concerning transactions, including yours, across every user, so transactions will be recorded regardless who is online as long as there is *someone* online.

Another theory: If Mark believes they can catch the alleged perpetrators, disclosing what they know could get in the way of whatever steps the police is undertaking, e.g. it could alert them and make them flee to another country, or they could obfuscate whatever they know has been found on the blockchain.

Unless your business has anything to do privacy, anonymity, drugs, or is otherwise something illegal or very techy/nerdy, you will see something between 1% and no volume at all of your sales. Bitcoin is still primarily a speculative asset and its use as a medium of exchange is very low besides certain specific exceptions. 
You don't lose anything by implementing bitcoin as an alternative payment method but don't expect that 9% more to materialize right away.

ATMs usually rely on charging fees per transaction; I think it's a safe assumption that all Bitcoin ATM makers are following this model because I can't picture anything else (pay upfront $20 to use the machine? extremely unlike). Plus you can't charge anything higher than 5% per transaction or people would feel scammed, so that leaves a small fee per transaction. Hence you need volume for it to be viable.


That's the exact same thing. Transaction volume = number of transactions the ATM handles.


Agreed. That doesn't change the fact that for an ATM to be profitable it needs to handle a great amount of transactions if you rely on charging small fees.


In theory. But in practice, if you only have 100 bitcoiners in a large city, a Bitcoin ATM is still going to see a very tiny transaction volume regardless where you put it. 


I'm not judging the *future potential* of a bitcoin ATM, just its viability as a business at the moment, in the present.


Four business in Spain that could be burning investors money without real profits like Neo&amp;Bee did in Cyprus before its CEO run away. There are unfortunately no public numbers to judge whether these are profitable businesses or not.

The court in Japan ordered a bankruptcy trustee to take over the case and exclude Mark Karpeles from it, hence, supposedly the coins are in control of this trustee and his law firm.

Just in case you are not aware, which seems to be the case: Bitcoin is not perfect. It has many still unresolved issues in fact (scalability, speed, 50% attacks by mining pools, etc) that could break it catastrophically in the future even if it's survived so far.
Of course no altcoin that copy-pastes Bitcoin source code is going to have a chance in the "battle" because it's still going to have the same issues, but that doesn't mean that something better can't come along eventually.

I'm not defending him, but I think you are overreacting there. I don't think he is "mentally disturbed" or "challenged" like people love to claim.


Saying that you'd return something isn't an admission that *you* consider it extraordinary, just that it's not always common. It *is* true that certain countries have a more "finders-keepers" attitude at lost property than others.


So he's not good at being a CEO, managing companies or being a business man in general. Nothing pathological there.


Look, I don't know the guy. I lost substantially to MtGox. But given all that has come to light so far the simplest and most likely theory is that he is just a normal guy that fucked up big time, and honestly, all these theories of him being "mentally disturbed" to me sound ridiculous.

@_date: 2014-08-30 22:23:22
The problem is that the bitcoin community, at its core, is circlejerky. It's easy to pass the blame to the moderation, but who are they to say what kind of content should be posted in the sub? Bitcoiners want circlejerkness, that's why this kind of posts always rise to the top, people are voluntarily upvoting. A strict censoring policy would only get you a massive uprise and shitstorm followed by a migration to another sub where they'd go back to post circlejerky things, abandoning the original.
This is what the bitcoin community is, it cannot be changed. Us that complain about circlejerkness are a minority trying to fight the majority.

Which ones? Because to my knowledge you always need to rent the place where the ATM goes. The only difference is whether you can pay for it.


You are talking about revenue/cash volume, not transaction volume, but it doesn't matter either way. Yes, there are multiple ways to word how you charge fees. It doesn't change the fact that you need volume (or ridiculous fees that no one would pay) for it to become profitable.


Sure, provided there's a large enough demand, which so far we have yet to see.


Again, this would only work if the demand existed.


There are two things here. One is the amount of people likely to use a bitcoin ATM today, in a month or 3 months time. The other is the potential for an ATM in the somewhat distant *future*, say, in the next few years. Is it shortsighted to expect a business to be profitable in the first year? Probably yes, but I wasn't talking about that when I said that Bitcoin ATMs in Spain are not a viable business at the moment.


I asked you for a source on this last time and I was pointed to a facebook group and a couple of bitcoin meet ups. Saying "a more likely explanation" doesn't make it more likely; you don't have anything to back up that statement.


Most of what I'm talking about are public things that you can Google, but anyway, all I'm saying is this is what I believe to be the case for what I can observe and if I'm wrong I'm happy to be proven otherwise. You feel comfortable saying I'm wrong without proving that you can have a sustainable business by placing ATMs in Spain today.

Yeah, basically. In practice, breaching the server usually isn't simple, and there are measures MtGox could have taken to minimize the risk if this happened. It still isn't clear what exactly happened and how, but like I was trying to say before, daily limits would not have been enough security.

If these measures are too much just go use btc-e instead, but don't complain when another massive heist happens and your coins can't be recovered because the exchange didn't bother taking all measures it could to prevent it.

One misconception that many large companies have is believing that they only have to integrate bitcoin payments, sit back, and relax. Guys, it's cool that you are doing this, but you have to actively endorse and support bitcoin transactions as well, e.g. by giving discounts. 
Bitcoin is practically unknown to your userbase and will remain so without trying to change that. Even if you are doing this solely for the publicity and the press, you'll get a great deal more of exposure if you come across as not just as a big company that once tested Bitcoin, but one that actively endorses it. Win/win for everybody.
Just don't be that company that tried Bitcoin once and then forgot about it.

Paging since he had a solid theory last time, any ideas? The only thing I can imagine myself is that whoever is doing the splitting decided 50 BTC was too little or would take too long and switched to bigger outputs per address. That, or the thieves are done ~~mixing~~ splitting the coins and are collecting them back, with the MtGox API tracking them for some strange reason.
Edit: Found more addresses with ~2K BTC outputs which would support the theory that this isn't reconsolidation yet but rather a change in the splitting algorithm: 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:43:44

Well it's going to be harder to associate coin movements directly with Gox, but rest assured, if someone was moving 400K BTC out of some ancient addresses overnight the community will take notice eventually. The blockchain is public for everyone, regardless whether we know MtGox addresses or not.




See [here]( just replied you in another thread :)


The article wasn't anything official, just some random lawyers complaining that they believed to have seen 530K BTC on the move (incorrectly).

As for Karpeles: As far as I understand from following this whole fiasco since February, he's given the keys of everything he had to the bankrupcty trustee (basically a lawyer firm), and carries on with his life without much of a care in Tokyo while the trustee is in charge of handling the mess, carrying the investigation, and eventually running the trial when the investigation is over. Since the investigation is reportedly taking a while, the trial may not happen for another year or two. Whether the bitcoins/fiat were really stolen and by who remains unanswered meanwhile.

None of what you originally quoted as source suggests that ATMs at malls are *viable business* in Spain, which is why I asked again. An ATM needs *hundreds*, if not *thousands* of transactions a day just to pay its floor. Those enquiries on a facebook group and bitcoin meet ups are great, but the reality is that they won't amount for more than a twenty transactions in a lucky month.
Show me proof that an ATM in Spain can process hundreds of transactions a day and I'll believe in its viability as a business. So far all I can see is that there's *a little bit* of demand, but not enough to sustain a business.

Most people working for someone else outside of the Silicon Valley *don't* usually get equity, so it's not that rare. It would have been the smart thing to do for a young company like MtGox in order to create a thriving team, but then again Mark wasn't a business man to think on those terms.

It's theoretically possible, but while the "selfish miner" withholds his blocks, he risks someone else solving the same block and broadcasting it, case in which the chain of the selfish miner would become invalid. It would usually be more profitable for the miner to broadcast his solved block asap than to withhold it and risk throwing away the effort of solving it.

He was owed money after a deal between CoinLab and MtGox fell apart. That's it. I really doubt he had anything else to do with Gox.

Notice how in the last transaction of 2014, some of the coins go to the address 1KecDYadohxk8MCDqKF8SBEMhCUNveAsCj. This is the famous 180K BTC address from a few days ago that started splitting, subsequent transactions coming from this address have been spotted in the MtGox API via [CoinSight]( recently.
Either the thief is Mark himself, the thieves are really dumb and decided to send the coins back to MtGox now, or there was no theft and they found out they had the coins after all.

It depends. The larger Bitcoin grows the larger the impact a fundamental change has, *but*, not all features or improvements to the protocol have  to be "painful" so to speak. When a feature or improvement can be added in such a way that the transition is seamless and/or backwards compatible, and thus introducing it wouldn't break existing infrastructure or implementations, bitcoin core devs should definitively be open to the idea. Assuming it can also be properly tested, etc.
For *big* fundamental changes in Bitcoin though, such as tweaking/changing the mining or hashing algorithm, I would agree with Andreas that if Bitcoin is to continue growing there is very little time left to make changes, if any. In practice I don't think the bitcoin core devs will consider these kind of changes anymore there unless they come accross something absolutely stunning and perfect in every way.

@_date: 2014-01-26 22:32:57
Check out: 
Long story short: Withdrawals at Gox aren't working properly. People holding fiat at the exchange are in most of the cases forced to buy BTC back, transfer it to another exchange, and sell it there. This makes Gox prices artificially high (because people are *buying* at Gox, even when they want to sell); and as the situation worsens the gap grows higher compared to other well functioning exchanges.

You can move GoxBTC across Gox addresses just fine, this is what's known as an "internal transfer", which is not relayed on the blockchain.
Some people are interested in buying GoxBTC and some in selling them. Those who buy just provide a Gox account where to receive the coins, and those selling can transfer from Gox account to Gox account just fine and receive their real BTC the ordinary way.

"If a business entity operating centralized and closed creates a competitor to a currency of which its main characteristics include being free, decentralized (i.e. not owned or controlled by a particular entity) and open, will it kill it?"
The answer to this question is always a resounding no, for the same reason that Facebook creating an "internet competitor" and giving it away for free to its user would never work: because people trust decentralized and open much more than closed, and particularly with bitcoin where this is key to its traction.
Edit: Not that Internet is truly, fully decentralized at the moment, but you get my point.

No one would be surprised if they go under and disappear with their customer funds anytime now, and yet, if it does happen, bitcoin's reputation would take another major hit. *That's* why people care, because it's an issue that goes beyond "don't use them if you don't like them"; it's another cataclysm waiting to happen and you can choose to either ignore it and watch the fireworks afterwards, or start demanding that they become more transparent and provide proof that it's properly managed before it's too late.

That is a very short sighted way to see things. Right now, what bitpay needs is, first and foremost, Bitcoin adoption. As long as they are backed by investors, which they are, it's not so important to squeeze profits right away; if they instead focus on **long term growth** eventually they'll be able to reap bigger fruits.

Unlikely because the heartbleed bug would only have allowed a potential exploiter get account logins in the best scenario for them, case in which the bitcoins moving would have been noticed. For the bitcoins to disappear silently, without exchange trace, there had to be some sort of software bug involved, like the transaction malleability issues, except that was obviously not it.

Actually the leaked php snippet from Gox was for the most part fine. Not perfect, but far from having "crappy programming practices" all over the place. In fact, judging by the exploits that btc-e has had over the years (XSS everywhere) I'd say it's more likely btc-e founders are crappier coders than Mark ever was, and they are still around.

Yeah, but only when they started moving on the 7th we saw them in the MtGox API, thereby suggesting there was a good possibility it was MtGox itself moving them. Prior to that, we had found the coins, but we couldn't tell with certainity who was behind them. The community *speculated* that it was Gox's, but it wasn't clear without the API hint.

You talk about "we" and "us" but as somebody with funds lost in the Gox limbo I've had zero involvement in this letter or project and no one asked my opinion.

This can be explained with arbitrage. In a scenario where MtGox manages to succeed in building an artificial bubble like the willy report suggests, folks on every other exchange, including the chinese, would rush to buy what on other exchanges seemed "cheap" bitcoins. Since one couldn't easily (or at all) withdraw fiat from Gox, prices never had a chance to level out, so it kept rising instead. The fact that exchanges like BTCChina or later Huobi had higher peaks could just mean that people were getting overly irrational; happens during what seemed at the time a legit bubble.
The willy report had a pretty solid theory and some damning evidence, the charts you posted not so much.
I'm in this for the long run and I have no interest in seeing prices dropping, but as a community we shouldn't cover our eyes and ears and go "*lalala I can't hear you*" just because it goes against our short term interest.

You are looking at this from the point of view of a digital currency directly competing with Bitcoin, but the thing is, this is not quite what Ethereum is. The 'currency' aspect of it just happens to be there to tie it all together but Ethereum is more like a decentralized computing network than a currency. Think 'Tor for developers' not 'Bitcoin alternative with a pointless Turing complete script language'.
Ethereum could probably have been done without having to position it as a Bitcoin competitor, but alas that's what they founders decided to do, because money.

The "daily limit" is a software thing, not something attached to the real bitcoins they have. Imagine that you have money at home and install a very secure, very hard to break lock at the door, but the robber just breaks a window, takes the money, and leaves through the window: the lock in the door didn't protect anything because the robber didn't use the door.
In the case of MtGox, the house is the server and the door is the software of the exchange. The software could have been secure with the daily limits, but if the hackers broke a window they could still steal the bitcoins.

I'm not sure why people still get excited about these things. Bitcoin is not anymore the obscure piece of open source software that it once was back in 2011-2012, pratically every form of media, local and national, has already covered it at some point. Quite a lot of people in the first world have *heard* about bitcoin by now, bitcoin is most likely not going to be an alien term at all for the tiny percentage of the 'followers' of New Scientist that will see that update.
In my modest opinion, I think that the bitcoin community should move on from getting excited like a child every time someone says bitcoin. If it is because you care about the price, it's not going to move the price or make any meaningful impact because *that already happened*, there's a reason why bitcoins are $230 a pop today and not $10. Just acknowledge the fact that bitcoin is *known* to the world, even if the vast majority only have a very vague idea of what it is, and move on to do other interesting things in the space. People have already heard about bitcoin, now it's time to show them more about what it can do, not just "spread the word".

Because what suits to *our* conversation is perceived as expensive by outsiders. I'm personally fine with full BTC denomination, but then I've heard many times the argument of "I'd like to get into Bitcoin, but it's too expensive now".
We should try, hard, to adopt mBTC, because the current prices are alienating and outsiders don't get that owning/using a fraction of a BTC is fine too.

It's the same for both Kraken and non-Kraken users as far as I can tell. It's the same entity reviewing and approving the claims. The only thing to take into account that is not mentioned in the email is that the trustee has reviewed BTC-only claims so far. So if you claimed e.g. 1000 BTC and $1, your claim most likely has not been reviewed yet.

Not really. Just sit tight and hope they get to you eventually. Supposedly the trustee is still going through all the remaining claims.

They are doing this no doubt because of the high rate of chargebacks and fraud with bitcoin related payments. You would do the same if you ran a PayPal-like service and had to deal with 40-50% of the payments coming back and a shitton of complains.

Technically 402 could have been adopted by services like PayPal. The problem is that hiding online content behind a paywall, which I assume was the original intent behind the status code (much like 401 is a response for content behind an "authorization wall") does not make a great model for the online world we live in today. It makes sense to pay for things, subcriptions, etc, but not to *view* a page that can be freely copied and distributed (as much as online news publications want it otherwise)

As a fellow dev who's been watching bitcoin for years and is thinking about the same thing you do right now, in my modest opinion, if you want to build a startup around bitcoin you need to find something that is appealing to non-bitcoiners. Focus too much on feedback and you'll end up with a product nobody will buy, because the truth is the vast majority of the people here are only interested in speculation (that is, making money), not using the currency. It's a hard nut to crack because getting bitcoiners to pay you is hard, and getting non-bitcoiners interested in bitcoin on the first place is harder. The companies in this space that are cash flow positive can be counted on the fingers of one hand at the moment.
@_date: 2015-02-22 11:47:03
Unless you sell something illegal and/or something people prefer to buy privately/discreetly, you'll most likely see no volume even if you entice your customers with discounts or rebates. This is because bitcoin today is still mostly about speculation, and those invested in it usually want merchant adoption not to spend it, but to get publicity so their investment grows.

They don't "hate bitcoin", many Googlers have been openly involved in BTC, take for example Mike Hearn or Charles Lee. The reason the Google Wallet team does this is probably because they were getting a lot of chargebacks due to fraudsters taking advantage of the irrevocability of bitcoin via Google Wallet, much like what happens with people buying bitcoin via PayPal. Since the number of fraud complains due to bitcoin is likely high, their team has to assume bitcoin related transactions are high risk, and that's the result. For that you have not Google or PayPal to thank, but the asshole fraudsters that are buying bitcoins and then asking for a refund knowing well bitcoins can't be refunded but cash can.

Just for the record, the blockchain and wallets are different things. I guess what you mean is that you are storing your wallet locally, i.e., using a wallet.dat file. If you do, remember to at least encrypt the wallet (bitcoin-qt has an option to do so built in) and backup online somewhere.
As for how safe it is, provided it's encrypted it might be okay for small amounts, but you can certainly do better. See:

* The buyer of bitcoins can always perform a chargeback and there is no way for the seller to contest that
* There are many hacked accounts and when PayPal realizes that such an account has been fraudulently used, they will also perform a chargeback
* PayPal doesn't like bitcoin, as the bitcoin network is in direct competition to it

The thing is, ultimately PayPal can't *expect* to compete with Bitcoin, in the same way they can't expect to compete with the US dollar. Either they get in the fry and start charging transaction fees or they don't and are left out. As much as they'd like it to be otherwise, PayPal is a payment processor, not a currency. 
I mean what could they do? sure they could start their own alternative digital currency, but it's likely they'd fail miserably because they can't replicate the decentralized and unregulated nature of Bitcoin. It's probably on their best interest to just accept what is happening and embrace it.

It was ridiculously risky back then to *buy* Bitcoins. The technology and design behind it was incredible back then as it is now, but it  always takes a bit more than that for something to be adopted and become mainstream.
As far as everyone knew in 2009, it was risky, Bitcoin might not necessarily have managed to come out of obscurity. 
Those who blindly believed on it made it big, yes, but don't beat yourself about it; no matter how impressive something might be it always is hard to blindly believe on anything, specially in technology where things rise and fall overnight. Putting all your savings on Bitcoin in 2009-2011 was just a crazy thing to do for any reasonable person.

Correct, previously it used to be that one could transfer or withdraw small amounts of fiat (up to $1000 or so) without verification, with only greater amounts requiring verification, but it seems this option is being removed today.

Think of email when it was first created. The concept was sound, but it was hard for regular people, you had to set up your own server to send and receive mails. As time went by services were built on top of it and eventually it became ridiculously user friendly to set up and use email. Bitcoin will go through something similar, give it time before spreading it to non tech people.

Perhaps a stupid question, but do you guys *type* Bitcoin addresses? So far I've never needed to do that; I would either copypaste (since addresses are a single "word" you can just double click/tap it to select it) or scan a QR code. Were bitcoin addresses even designed to be typed manually in the first place? It sure doesn't look like so.

It's a silly idea for a decentralized currency to rely on a single, centralized address look up directory, AND it's alright for cryptocurrencies to have hard to remember addresses: you are supposed to use them with a computer, where you can always copy-paste your way.

I would guess it'd be illegal for a bank account to close your account if they can't provide a reason why, e.g. proof of suspected money laundry activity. But of course that doesn't mean they have to tell the public, just the parties involved. We won't know unless the owners of these exchange services decide to talk in detail about it, but if they don't that's probably because the banks had legimitate reasons to close the accounts.

Old world fiat is controlled by the government, which means they may print out more money when they feel like it, devaluing your own, and they may just take a % of what you have in your bank when they feel like it's necessary (e.g. in case of debt, war, etc).
It's too much power over something that's supposed to belong to you and not the state. Replace old world fiat with Bitcoin and all these problems go away.

Sadly none of those companies have the balls to bet on what is usually considered a young and unstable economy yet. I can see them adopting Bitcoin, but only when everyone else and their mother already process Bitcoin payments aswell. Not to worry, Bitcoin can thrive and grow without them.

Inputs and outputs are in fact stored in the blockchain, which is distributed to every client in the network, so no need to collect them, they are all readily available from the very first block ever found. The condition for each new block however relies on data from the immediately previous block found, in such a way that previously used inputs would not be accepted by the network for the next block (both the input and the output are checked before granting a block)
Satoshi clearly spent a great deal of time thinking on these things while designing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-21 01:22:17
Here's what I'd suggest you to do: read more about bitcoin. Read satoshi's original paper, document yourself about how it works, read other people's thoughts about its future, and *then* decide. If after that you yourself come to the conclusion that Bitcoin will be a huge part of society this decade, then you will obviously want to jump in regardless its speculative value now. But just judge by yourself, because no one can predict the future.

Not really. From my experience as a small business owner, this is more of an exception than a rule; taxes are generally more abusive here than in many other countries, and the state favours those who have no interest in work by extending unemployment wages and Hartz IV (which, don't get me wrong, these are great for people who need them, but there's a ridiculously great amount of people with a set mentality of "why should I work when others pay for me" and the state completely ignores this), while at the same time chops benefits and help for legitimate business owners, such as the Gründungszuschuss program for new founders, which was completely cancelled a year ago, but done in such a way that the law would not *seem* like it was canned, so people would not openly complain.
You are entitled to think I'm whining here, but the conclusion I draw from the things I've seen during the past few years is that the state believes word by word the following: "Well, lazy and/or helpless people aren't going to work anyway, so let's keep the money flowing there so that part doesn't collapse. Also fuck business owners, they are smart enough, they'll figure out a way". 
And let's not talk about the fact the law makers had a free pass at formulating a vague and poorly phrased law that could and is interpreted in the benefit and interest of the state.
So, yeah, I don't believe Germany is doing many things right. Then again this is probably not that different from the majority of the countries in the world.

Fun fact: in Soviet Russia, the goverment used to run secret society experiments by isolating cities and sending people there. These cities would be used to test different laws and governing methods among other things, by carefully making sure the people living there would not communicate with other cities or regions. To this day it still remains a mystery what happened with these experiments, even though the outcome is probably documented and lying somewhere in Russia. Many of these cities ended up abandoned.

Right, but pretty rethoric aside, there's no excuse for most of the Bitcoin exchange services right now not to laser focus on scaling and securing their services when they are getting massive influx of users and money. Nobody is asking for perfection, but I'll be damned if they can't do better than they do now. 
It's not asking for much, really. There are lots of small internet startups out there that are much more conscious about security, stability and scalability than all these exchange services.

Disclaimer: I've read and understood the paper.
It's not that easy to digest, people. The paper assumes you understand what cryptographic hashes are, what roles do private and public keys play in cryptographic functions, etc. There is nothing excessively complicated for e.g. a developer in there, but it's definitively not something I'd give average Joe to understand how Bitcoin works.
Yes, people should definitively document themselves and try to understand Bitcoin in detail before having an opinion or writing about Bitcoin. But the paper isn't for everyone either.

Because this is Bitcoin, exchanges are not going to care if the coins are stolen because there's nothing and no one regulating stolen coins. If anything, *some* of the exchanges *may* feel benevolent and block the trading of the stolen coins, but then there's nothing stopping the robber selling these coins in the black markets anyway.

With the queue they have and their track record so far, it's probably reasonable to expect 6 to 10 months if you order now. It's unlikely to be worth it given the how difficulty will skyrocket as BFL fulfills earlier preorders.

There's a longer way than people think from the head of PayPal thinking about it to the company actually executing on it, BUT if it happened, the implications would be such that Bitcoin would turn from a "could be" to a definitive "it is". And PayPal would profit handsomely for being an "early adopter" in terms of payment processors.

Bullshit for you, but certainly not for the game developers and publishers. There's a reason why buying/selling in-game currency is actively punished and labelled as "illegal", and in the vast majority of the cases it's not about covering a money making scheme, but about retaining the game flow and balance that game designers have worked hard to build. You see, if you build a game with content lasting for an average of 5 months, it's a problem if someone can buy his way through the black market and beat all said content in 2 days. It poses a challenge for the game designers and devs who can't anticipate these scenarios and threatens to shorten the game lifespan. It's a very real problem, whether you choose to believe it or not.

This is an advantage to every Bitcoin user as attacks can be tested on networks with a lower total monetary value and spread and Bitcoin devs get to learn from it before it hits BTC. If there were no altcoins, there would no testing field, and new attacks vectors would only be discovered after they took place on the Bitcoin network.

I tried this for over a month. From my experience: it works about 10-20% of the time, that is, when you get lucky; but in the vast majority of the trades you'll walk out with less. Whether you do it with a bot or by hand, I don't recommend it.

@_date: 2013-04-26 00:10:47
I'm sorry but your argument holds no water, there's no risk for the merchant if they implement something like bitpay, and in exchange they get lower fees than with any other payment processor, zero chargebacks, and additional media exposure for the shop. Regardless the problems Bitcoin has at the moment, I would not think it twice if I were the owner.

Strictly speaking, barring issues dealing with banks, cash and whatnot, yes. In practice, you have to get people to use your exchange, it's not just about the platform; drawing people away from Mt. Gox when they have majority market share isn't that easy, even with the reputation they have. Bitstamp is a perfectly fine exchange for instance, and yet they have only managed to get about 15% of the cake for some reason. And then there's BTC-E on the opposite side of the spectrum, which is pretty much shitty, but manages to stay afloat.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:57:55
Great, let's standarize Mt.Gox rates as *the* price for Bitcoin, that's exactly what we need.

It's not gonna be worth it, it'll take you months or perhaps even a year to reach a few cents. Your electricity bill will definitively be higher than anything you can mine out of an old laptop right now, not to mention you risk killing the laptop in the long run (too much heat etc)

Not to be a party pooper but historically, in bitcoin, when bubbles crash, the price never goes back to where it was before the bubble. Never say never but $150 coins might be wishful thinking at this point.

Because it's "cheaper". I've seen this pattern many times: newbies looking to buy BTC notice BTC-e for their seemingly lower prices, ignoring the fact there may be a reason for that, and the ball keeps rolling. Greed has this thing.

Personally I'd like to think of things like bitpay as the "training wheels" of bitcoin, something to use while the coin is developing, but that eventually becomes obsolete as the currency stabilizes.

@_date: 2013-04-10 13:15:26
I don't question the concept of Bitcoin itself, but all these qualities won't mean much if the currency isn't adopted. It might happen Bitcoin goes mainstream, but my point is, it doesn't look like this is gonna happen tomorrow and *yet* people are trading Bitcoins like this was going to happen in the immediate short term future.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I know Bitcoin is and will be valuable, but is it *this* valuable now, with an adoption rate that has yet to catch up?
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:48:27
Don't think so, afaik the bots exploited the fact that trades for ridiculously small amounts were allowed by the API, even though normally one could not do it through the website.

@_date: 2013-06-16 11:15:00
If you are looking to buy, say, 20.000 BTC from an exchange, you most likely won't find a single individual wanting to sell his 20k for the market price at once. Instead, you'll buy your way through small offers (10 BTC + 3 BTC + 123 BTC + 47 BTC + ...) from different sellers until you match your desired 20k. This means that the price can effectively fluctuate until you reach said 20k, because the market doesn't wait until you are done and available offers are constantly changing.
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:32:30

These occasional spikes in buy orders driving the price up seem a bit artificial to me. I think there's a good chance this isn't natural growth, in which case we can expect a little crash eventually.

Well, can't say I'm surprised. No wonder the subreddit has the reputation it has.
@_date: 2013-11-25 12:43:20

Is this the only bank people can use in China?
@_date: 2013-08-11 15:33:33


I suppose so :) It's a good way to learn that: 1) Indicators "predict" the past, not the future and 2) there's no pattern that you can "crack", no analysis can guess the future. It's alright in any case because I'm into Bitcoin for the tech and I was just mostly playing around for fun when I tried.


I'm sure it's possible. It's a little bit like building a bot/machine that can outperform humans at chess; theoretically possible but in practice very hard and very time consuming to engineer one that correctly accounts for every combination of possibilities and circumstances.
@_date: 2013-06-23 13:22:26

It's a special "password" that you can give external applications to do actions on your behalf without actually disclosing the password of your account. For example, a mobile app may request your coinbase API key to fetch how many BTCs you have any time, without the need to know your actual login details.
In practice API keys may sometimes allow to withdraw or do critical operations with your balance; malicious developers may request your API key to do one thing in an app and then secretly do another. That's why one has to be careful on where do you use your API keys and what rights do these grant.

On mtgox.com there's a 2011 wikipedia quote claiming 80% market share of Bitcoin trading, but this is probably outdated; could you give us an up to date estimate of the trading volume going on through mtgox compared to other exchange services?
@_date: 2013-08-11 09:21:52
No such thing as free money. I tested an EMA trading bot for a month; every time the bot lost money, I would check what happened and fine tune the parameters accordingly, only to watch the market do something new and unpredictable with every crossover. I really don't recommend it unless you are willing to do trading 24 hours a day, and if you are then you are probably better off not using a bot anyway.

Assuming you talk about an encrypted wallet, supposedly many, because the algorithm used is AES-256, which is several orders of magnitude more resistant than SHA1 against brute forcing. But then again, AES is common and we don't know whether the NSA has already figured out how to crack it, which is possible.

The point is most of the transactions ocurring in the bitcoin world right now are market trading, as opposed to sending the money from A to B like Western Union is generally used. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:11:04
Bitstamp worked well for me and many others, but that being said it's a young company and definitely not a bank, so don't take 100% reliability for granted. The SEPA transfer took about 48h for me, not very ideal; if you transfer to Bitstamp you have to think about the price of Bitcoin in one or two days, not the price it has now.
I can't talk about Mt.Cox because I never used them.

The point he's suggesting is that there isn't a race against Bitcoin success per se, but against the money laundering that is happening thanks to Bitcoin. It seems very likely, I don't think Bitcoin has reached that point for large, established banks to even notice it yet.

I think this, IMHO, excellent news. It means the mainstream press is not anymore all over Bitcoin, and yet the price has stabilized at +$100, which is much higher than in the "pre-bubble" period. The "bubble" was a success for Bitcoin.

Very. You can't possibly assess whether Bitcoin will be a success or not if you don't understand the technology behind it; if, like many of us, you do your research and come to the conclusion that the design of Bitcoin is a breakthrough that allows something previously thought not possible, you will also believe it will find a way to overcome any obstacle that gets in the way from an economy point of view.

Not true, see:

If only Mt.Gox kept an engineering blog or something with detailed infos on what they are facing and what are they doing to improve it, that could help *a bit* to gain confidence in them. It's disheartening to see them consistently lagging and crashing with no public conversation going on about it at all other than "we small we buy more servers stay tuned".
@_date: 2013-10-24 12:03:18
Damn, that's the end of a legend.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:15:47
This needs to change asap. More and more people are realizing now that DDoSing Mt Gox can drive the prices down, which will lead to more attacks, which in turn would lead to more aggresive price fluctuations and eventually leaving the coin so fragile that it could potentially lose all its value. This is bad, not just for the speculators, but for the future and credibility of Bitcoin as a currency.
The problem is, there isn't anything better to replace Mt. Gox right now. Out of the five or so "reliable" exchange services out there, all of them have scalability issues; it's just that Mt. Gox is the biggest in terms of users and hence takes the bigger hit, but if all these users were to migrate to Bitstamp, to name one, you would see the exact same kind of problems.
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:39:09
I'm sure this is not a technical challenge, but rather a design decision that Satoshi originally opted for and that Bitcoiners support. The thing is, for a chargeback system to work someone has to have the final say and the power decide whether a chargeback is legitimate or fraud; this works well with centralized systems because there is ultimately someone responsible, but Bitcoin is decentralized, you can't possibly have an entity processing chargebacks without breaking its decentralized nature. 
Also keep in mind that even though doing a fork is technically trivial, in order for the network to adopt it at least 51% of the nodes have to vote in favour of it (by using it) due to said decentralization; hence why people here are replying with "no one will use", because this the key factor deciding whether a feature or a fork makes it into the Bitcoin network.
(And yes, the network could potentially rebel against the current Bitcoin devs by not using new updates, handy if they were to fall into the dark side)
@_date: 2013-08-17 13:20:16
Blockchain.info has a ["Number of transactions excluding popular addresses" chart]( and I would think the infamous "correct horse battery staple" bitcoin address is excluded there as well.
@_date: 2013-06-06 16:14:18
It's not a fork of the blockchain, but it *is* a fork of Bitcoin's code strictly speaking.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:37:14
The code is injected into btc-e thanks to a very simple and very stupid XSS attack, and once this is done it can fire requests from within the page simulating clicks on the background, so to speak:
    postData("../ajax/coins.php", "act=withdraw&amp;sum=" + btc_amount + "&amp;address=" + wallet_btc + "&amp;coin_id=1&amp;token=" + token, 3);
Since btc-e hasn't implemented any sort of CSRF tokens this works. 
So essentially: btc-e needs to fix their site, namely against XSS attack vectors and implementing CSRF tokens to avoid automated withdrawals. The attacker didn't use any exploit or zero-day at all, btc-e made it all easy enough.
As for the "jpg" url, a server software like Apache can be easily configured to interpret jpg urls as html with a couple rules.

Success for Bitcoin would be your grandmother being able to do grocery shopping at your nearest store paying with Bitcoins. In other words, mass mainstream adoption by both consumers and merchants.

You are only notified the transaction is safe to accept once it has +1 confirmation at least, being connected to good nodes doesn't remove any risk for 0 confirmation transactions because the good node itself *cannot know* whether the transaction will be accepted by the network or not. Using good nodes only guarantees you won't get invalid transactions in the sense of invalid data, but a double spend of this kind doesn't rely on sending invalid transactions per se, the integrity of the transactions would be fine; it'd be just a matter of which transaction get through and which one doesn't, which neither the merchant not the good node can know in advance with 0 confirmations.

Here's how you can avoid this kind of stuff hit you:
* 1. Always be logged out. Log in only when you need to trade and log out as soon as you are done.
* 2. Don't store your money/coins in an exchange service for longer than it takes to transfer and trade, transfer it out as soon as you can.
* 3. Don't click links on the btc-e trollbox... in fact don't even read the trollbox at all.
Remember that if you get stolen digital currency, it's almost guaranteed gone for good, so take the appropriate measures.

Let's not forget that it doesn't go both ways. Libertarians by definition should like the concept of Bitcoin, but not all Bitcoiners necessarily believe in Libertarianism (even if many do). Bitcoin should ideally be kept neutral when it comes to political ideologies, in my opinion.

Off the top of my head I can't think of something specific, but think of tools or services around Bitcoin that you'd like to have/use but don't exist yet (or the ones that exist are shitty), that's usually a good start imho.

Bitcoin is still ridiculously hard for the average street joe. We need more people working on ideas around making Bitcoin more approachable and easier to use for the masses. I'd say: think of one of the (many) pain points Bitcoin currently has and figure out a solution that can be turned into a business.

Prices plummeted on other exchange services because I suppose Mt. Gox still controls 60-70% of the overall trading volume of Bitcoins. Until this changes, Mt. Gox really is in control of the coin.
Good news for speculators though, because at the moment prices are guaranteed to be down every time Mt.Gox stops or goes down.
@_date: 2013-05-09 14:20:25
Well yes, no one can look into the future. People are just talking based on their prior experiencies with BFL; they have consistently missed all deadlines and have yet to ship to the masses.

It's a matter of psychology, if each "unit" of Bitcoin costs thousands of dollars, it won't be perceived by outsiders as a currency, but purely as an investment vehicle. You can argue that you can pay with 0.0005 BTC no problem and it would be true, but that won't deter people from thinking in round numbers = a lot of money in the case of Bitcoin = it's not something you use to buy things.
This is important because Bitcoin has to be used to succeed, and being perceived as a currency that you can transact with is a good step at getting there.

Sorry, no such thing as free money, and that applies to Bitcoins aswell. If you are prepared to make a moderate (3-4 digit) investment in equipment you could build a mining rig with GPUs while they are still able to mine some, see for more help. Keep in mind though that you won't by any stretch of imagination become rich by mining, even with the aforementioned investment it will take some time to break even.

Litecoin is already pretty much CPU resistant (favoring GPUs instead, despite the fact that wasn't the original plan). Basically, what you'd want for what tastycat suggests is a hash function that is efficient for CPUs (because otherwise there's no point in using every day devices), and at the same time hard enough not to be able to produce buckets of coins with a potato. Programmatically this seems a hard problem; by definition if something is CPU efficient folks will immediately jump in with their GPUs to mine as much as they can.
Crowdsourcing ala mechanical turk is another story, but frankly I don't think that's scalable.

I understand where you are coming from, but, you know, one thing (which I would not support) is denying or hating the ideology of statelessness, the potential Bitcoin has there, and the great deal of support coming from this group, and the other is placing a huge ass banner on the frontpage of forwarding everyone to the latter would be a little bit like forcing or at least suggesting every bitcoin user should support statelessness, and hence my comment against that idea.

Yes, I'm sure a 77 year old former factory worker with a brain damaged son would have nothing better to do than thinking about diversifying, not going all in, etc. 
He made a poor decision, but make no mistake; the bank *is* to blame here as well for tricking someone into investing in something that was clearly risky and that he did not understand. It's *not* okay for banks to persuade elderly people to put their money into high risk assets when the banks themselves know pretty well these people don't have the time or the inclination to learn about it. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:14:29
Don't be scared, it's going to be ok. 
First of, don't tell anyone how much bitcoins you have, either on the internet or in real life (may want to edit the post); second, take no help from a stranger to cash out; take the time to do this process yourself, you don't want to be scammed in the process.
Set up an account at coinbase.com if you are based in the US or bitstamp.com if you are in the EU. Transfer a small amount like 50 BTC and a start a bank withdrawal, you'll need a bank account for this obviously. Wait a couple of days or three and if everything goes well, keep doing this slowly and in small amounts of 2 or 3 BTC digits max. 
If you just remain calm and don't shout about it everything will go smooth. You'll have to decide how much you'll want to keep in BTC just in case it goes up in value in the future; keep at least 20 or 30%, perhaps more if you are not in desperate need of money.
Finally once you have cashed out an amount you are comfortable with: search for a tax consultant. You are going to have to pay taxes for capital gains, so you want to be informed about this.
Good luck!

Why wouldn't it? Paypal owning 30-40% of the coins in circulation would raise serious concerns about the future of the currency as the decentralized nature of the coin is put in jeopardy. People would move on to another cryptocurrency as they realized this is happening.

It definitively doesn't need PayPal, but PayPal supporting it would be a very nice push in terms of awareness — the vast majority of the population still need to *hear* about Bitcoin, and PayPal could help in that front. And more awareness = more adoption = more growth for the Bitcoin economy as a whole.

tl;dr of every advice you'll get here: most people in this subreddit think long term it will be worth several times its value now, but there's nothing guaranteeing that the BTC exchange rate won't crash to $0, hence you should only invest what you can realistically afford to lose (i.e., don't put your life savings into Bitcoin yet)
Additionally what I'd personally suggest: do research before buying. Bitcoin as a technology is open source and widely discussed over the net, it's easy to dive into the details on how (and why) it works, and understanding the technology behind it will allow you to make an informed decision, that is, to decide by yourself whether the tech is valuable enough to get involved and invest.

This always puzzled me. The idea behind Namecoin is great, except for the fact it's a currency as well. I guess the devs felt there had to be some sort of monetary incentive in order to get nodes and miners actively collaborating? No idea. Bitmessage for instance is based on Bitcoin but without the currency aspect of it, so it's clearly feasible.

Credit cards have a system called chargebacks by which consumers can request a refund directly to the credit card operator (Visa, MasterCard, etc) in case they've been subject to fraud and the transmitter flies away with the money.

Visa would effectively take the money back from the party that received it, that's why people like this system, you can force a fraudster to return the money back even if he refuses (provided the credit card operator agrees). They are able to do this because they are in control of their network, but that's not the case with Bitcoin transmitters.

This, they have absolutely no right to demand that information and the fact that they would *ask* would be reason enough for me to switch to another bank, let alone the blackmailing.

The thing I still don't understand is why would a company choose this business model. Why sell super powerful miners if you are able to mass produce them yourself, when you could just hoard them all on your own private bitcoin ”printing” farm? Surely the later is more profitable, given these things pay for themselves quickly.

It's a german web game operated by Kaiser Games, in the spirit of Second Life except purely web based. It's free to play, and like other f2p games it has a premium currency that users might buy for real money, that's what this bank seems to be offering.
The game is not well known so I assume they either approached Fidor Bank or are acquainted with them somehow.

They are lying. The bank itself wants to know, and they figured that maybe perhaps they could get away with it. Withdraw your money, but DON'T reply afterwards. Don't let them manipulate you.

That depends. It's not that terrible to call yourself CEO if your goal is to communicate, what, exactly, you do in the company, even if it's a one-two person company.
It's cringe-inducing if they go around bragging about how they are a "CEO", but merely stating what you do in the company isn't per se bad, and a title usually gets to the point quickly.

They should not be announcing these things until the contract is closed; it's basic negotiating 101, never consider the deal done until it's actually done. Good for them that they are making progress, but don't consider it a sure thing like they claim just yet.

The top voted answer here does a pretty good job at explaining Bitcoin to newcomers IMHO: 
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:03:35
Except it's still somewhat experimental and somewhat unproven which means that it can still can crash to $0 someday, even if it seems unlikely. Bitcoin has risk, a savings account doesn't.
@_date: 2013-08-20 10:22:41
Sounds pretty likely. The advantages of being an early early *early* adopter.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:32:36
Right, by eventually I meant short term here, as in today or in the next few days. And by little crash I meant the price going down in contrast to the somewhat stability the currency has had the past few days.

That's alright, I won't blame you. Hopefully once the code is up on Github folks can review it more easily what it does. I could probably set up a middle man sometime in the future so that the extension doesn't require permission to the exchanges themselves, but to a tiny backend in some random server that takes care of fetching the data and returning it back. I thought about it, but then I'd need to buy a domain and rent hosting for what I intended to be a small extension, which isn't very ideal...
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:45:03
Nope. If you buy from BFL now you won't get one in 6 month at least, if not a year, and by then it will take you months to break even, let alone make profit. Buy Bitcoins instead.

4) Are being realistic.


Sure, you will mine, the question is how much.


Anyone who tells you that you WILL get your order before 6 months is a straight up liar aswell. The facts are: 
* There are people who preordered +1 year ago and still haven't got their order.
* They have yet to prove they can mass produce and mass ship them.
Until the points above change, is there any reason to believe that 6 months isn't in fact a realistic estimate? Are you suggesting that 4 month is unlikely because you want it to be less than 4 months or is there anything to back that up, other than what BFL says, which has been consistently wrong ever since they started talking about shipping a year ago?


Again, the question is how much. No one can see into the future, but it's not unreasonable to expect for instance no more than 0.2 BTC a month, in which case it wouldn't pay for itself in months. Can you prove that this isn't a reasonable expectation at this point?
I don't dislike BFL, I'm sure they will manage to fulfill their orders eventually. But folks should make a unbiased and realistic assessment before preordering from them, and your post above is, IMHO, neither of those things.

Software needs to be *designed* too, it's not all about smashing the keyboard. And in the case of Bitcoin its design (design as in protocol and algorithm design) is way more important than its implementation. Saying developers created it gives the impression it was just a matter of a bunch of guys writing code, but there was work behind Bitcoin that goes beyond the code (see e.g. the paper of Satoshi, which afaik came before a working client). For all we know a mathematician could have been involved aswell, but the terms cryptographer and/or computer scientist are probably the safest assumption.
@_date: 2013-06-16 12:33:28


That's how it usually works. Tell the trading site what you want and it'll work on its own until it fulfills the request completely.


A bit of both, and also because offers move too quickly; if there are thousands of people buying and selling at any given point the trading site can't just sit there and wait for offers, it has to catch them so to speak before someone else does. Even relatively small orders take a few seconds (i.e. are not instantaneous) to complete usually.


This is how the price the falls; if everyone is selling and almost no one buys, you would usually sell below the market rate to increase your chances of fulfilling your order. As everyone tries to increase their chances of selling by lowering their price the overall market price falls, until eventually buyers looking for bargains start to appear and save the day. Usually you would still be able to find buyers by selling a lower rate than the market price though.

I tried before but I never really got a conclusive answer. What usually happens with this kind of threads is they get filled with crap posts by stupid people until the entire thread doesn't make sense any more and then it gets buried.
Sorry for the generalization there, there are lots of very bright people in the community, but since Bitcointalk lacks a voting mechanism this happens.

That's way too fast for a single day, now I would be surprised if it doesn't somehow crash.
@_date: 2013-04-27 12:56:17
It'd probably be all about the difficulty to mine, but if the difficulty is low then people with specialized GPU mining rigs will rush to make as much as they can as fast as they can, so the difficulty wouldn't stay low enough for every day devices for long. 
*Unless* of course we talk about a fork of Bitcoin that changes how this works, which is possible.
