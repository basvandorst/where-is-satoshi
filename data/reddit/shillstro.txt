Uhh right everyone is still paying taxes to the gov and nobody uses decentralized exchanges. Good luck with that.

Uses bitcoin. Complain to banks. Srsly bro use decentralized exchange.

Oh ok. I'm using Electrum 3.0.3 I think it works. I created a new segwit wallet and it generated bech32 (address that start with bc1) addresses to me, so I assume it will work if I send my coin using Electrum to my new Electrum bech32 wallet.

Quick...take  the falling knife with your bare hand
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:45:19
the more it's regulated the more the price will go down.
get used to it, regulation fags
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:48:18
I won't be able to send my coin to most wallets? So when I want to cashout it's possible that an exchange won't accept my bitcoin? I will have to create a new legacy wallet, send to it and only then send to the exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:07:18
Good luck everyone
@_date: 2018-08-26 15:39:48
Paying taxes is a scam
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:18:57
"theft at a gunpoint" = paying taxes lol
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:04:54
Why the merchants need coingate to accept LN? Can't they accept LN directly? And where can I find a list of those 4k merchants? ty
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:03:41
That is why I would sell everything now. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:23:23
ETH volume was much lower than $4 bi
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:07:16
Time to move to decentralized exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:50:01
Why use regulated bitcoin? Better stay with fiat. Regulation is what ruined it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:04:27
If you withdraw your income from paypal in a monthly basis then the fees are huge and bitcoin is much better.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:05:58
You sell your BTC and pay taxes to the government. How is that freeing people from tyranny?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:00:31
Paypal fails at the only thing that a centralized payment service is supposed to be good at. Paypal love scammers and always side with them. Fuck paypal.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:23:03
Don't buy a house.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:41:22
Why sell? Fuck the state and live off BTC
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:35:30
Fuck the government and religion.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:09:27
I don't think so. I think that I saw Ethereum with bigger volume than BTC before.
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:21:58
Idiots. The illuminati already told you that bitcoin will rise from the ashes. Remember the economist cover.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:41:22
Uh oh..
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:50:37
yes SegWit remains.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:53:50
Ban the shill!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:17:55
Why 100k though? Magic number?
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:56:46
No. Trump converted to Anarcho-capitalism after winning the 2020 war. Countries don't exist anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:30:32
Stop crying little children. bitcoin is stronger than it was one year ago. Get real, tards. Price will increase in due time. Fiat money, on the other hand, is on its way to die. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:59:37
Futures market? Expect price under 1k soon
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:31:35
For now, yes. Remember why it was created though. I won't say this again.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:35:31
I'm a time traveler from 2022. Price is $841,331.00. Unfortunately, we haven't reach a million yet. AMA.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:38:31
Remember why bitcoin was created. It could fall to one dollar, it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:05:11
6k is the new dream. How sad lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:46:36
You lose dumb fuck. You're a dumb state lover that threatened me with prison for refusing to get robbed. The state want to point a gun at my head for doing nothing and you're fine with it. You're a horrible shitty person.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:00:10
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:51:32
Hahaha you just lost your argument and made it personal. Congratulations shitty person.

You know it's time to buy when CNN says "Bitcoin is dead"
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:40:01
Best post in a while
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:21:17
I hope you're right!

I'd like to use OB but it takes forever to show a product after I click it.
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:18:10
It's free trade. If you don't want don't buy it. LoL. Pro tip: Read the Anarcho-Capitalism sub that's linked on the right side of this sub .......

@_date: 2017-09-08 16:51:32
I wish all countries banned bitcoin. That way we are free of stupid regulations and the price will skyrocket.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:23:39
bad news, more regulation
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:34:51
regulation = all the way down to 0
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:19:56
We need decentralized exchanges. Maybe create a fundraiser for devs.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:33:03
Prison? I didn't commit any crime. You continue to believe that politicians are on your side you moron.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:13:53
Sometime you will be wrong and either lose everything or become very rich. Probably lose everything with that mentality.
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:30:01
Bitcoin gotta be used as a p2p cash system not only store of value. This is starting to worry me, the fact that ppl want to think that bitcoin is like gold only..
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:06:35
Sounds like bitch cash was made to make miners rich.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:34:12
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:19:49
That was a good reading until you mentioned to contact your politician. You dumb fuck.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:40:36
Lol pussy
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:06:54
All of you 6k guys are full of shit. Nobody knows the price. Now  you can suck my dick
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:31:50
Sue? Fuck the state. Everyone should drop the dollar for once and all and use crypto
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:01:03
Why don't you sell and buy later then? Lol

It's time for you to suck a dick.

What if it is a watch only wallet? That is ok right?
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:39:21
Time to sell, sadly.
