You weren't talking about weed dude. You said "drugs". The number of people that would agree ALL drugs should be legalized is extremely small. And you have to be an idiot to think you don't need mainstream America to get this thing really going. Yeah if you had one out of 100 of every man, woman, and child on the planet using bitcoin that would be 80 Million, but since most of the population of the world doesn't even have access to a computer, that's not realistic is it? Then take people age 0-14 and 65+ out of the equation. You aren't left with a very large pool to attract. You need to try thinking about some basic marketing principals. This thing isn't just going to fulfill it's potential on it's own. We have to steer it the right way. Your vision for bitcoin would give it a value about a 10th of what my vision would put it at. That doesn't mean your vision is wrong, but many would argue it's misguided and has somewhat childish priorities.

I've got issues... Wtf. Apparently Bitcoin has issues, and until the community stands up and distances it's self from people like this, it's going to continue its slow decline. The big investors are going to try their best to rid bitcoin of that element, but we'll see how it works. I'm starting to see why Dogecoin was gravitated to so quickly. You guys are making it the down home family friendly version of bitcoin.

I wish we could all get along. Even better, a Bitcoin/Dogecoin alliance would be nice. So many in both communities only want their coin to win and all others to perish. They're missing a big point though. All good things have competition. If someone markets a new technology to me and they're the only ones doing anything like it, I'm likely to be skeptical and wait. If there are two similar products marketd to me, I'm likely to look at both and choose the one that appeals to me. Having 2-3 main cryptos helps adoption because they can appeal to different groups. Even visa and MasterCard can agree they don't care what a 18 year olds first credit card is as long as they have one.

You people are incredible. You claim you want to legitimize bitcoin, but this is the type of crap you up vote? Bitcoin is a BRAND like any other right now. If you don't protect your brand image, you're gonna be worth about as much as one of those pills pretty soon. This community should be ashamed. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:20:36
In YOUR OPPINION drugs shouldn't be illegal. Every government in the world and 99 people out of 100 would disagree. Unfortunately, bitcoin needs both of these groups to succeed. It most definitely does not need, nor should the community want, the "drugs are cool" crowd to be associated with it. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:01:46
All of those brands are already established household names, not brands still struggling to gain acceptance and shake previous drug connections. The fact is, no matter how much you try to deny it, people will be hyper sensitive to bitcoin/drug connections or references until bitcoin shake that image over time.

You don't know anything about me or my oppinion of drugs. My points are simply bringing a little thought of marketing principles to the discussion.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:58:51
Right, but the community doesn't have to celebrate it by up voting this crap.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:24:01
If this attitude is representative of the community as a whole, then you've been marketing yourselves wrong the whole time. Being used as a currency will keep the price at a steady, but lower and more affordable price. What I'm hearing is, you want people to care about bitcoin and hold it as an investment to spike the price. You can have one or the other, not both. Your poster boys the Wilkelvoss twins are hard at work making their hoarde of bitcoin something to be traded on the stock exchange, while some people still foolishly think it's something to use and spend. 
The currency aspect is all that gives bitcoin a purpose to the average joe. Keep pushing it as something to trade like gold, and you'll lose those average joes. Do you want a $500 bitcoin you can actually spend or a $0 bitcoin because it lost relevance to the masses? 
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:27:21
Realistically? Because the new has worn off and people are more interested in the future of the top alts.

You're right. I forgot LSD Blotter Art is a household name now. What logic. Go ahead and use that line when middle class America starts asking questions. Everyone forgets, the current value of bitcoin is all speculation. It's based on what COULD happen, not what it has accomplished so far. If it fails to resonate with middle America, it's going to be billions down the tube. It won't be the billion and millionaires that get screwed by it. It'll. r people like you that don't realize until their whole investment is worth pennies. 
TL;DR People need to Grow up

You sound like a smart guy, so I'm sure you understand that the majority of people out there would not agree with you right? When you're trying to get your price to rise, you need to be PC, thats all there is to it. If you don't care about the price, then do or push bitcoin for whatever purpose you want.

In case you haven't heard, there is real news in crypto currency today. This place is one winklevoss away from crashing.

The people that take those pills WOULD be the only people to see them... if there weren't over 2,000 up votes pushing this to the front page where over 100,000 subscribers, countless lurkers, the government, and the media see it. 
I have a sense of humor, but not when it comes to stupid shit like this that makes us all look bad.

Bitcoin took YEARS to do what Litecoin and Dogecoin have done in months, and yes, some of that lost market cap could very well have gone to purchases of alts, which explains how many of them are not decreasing in price as they are still mined by the millions every day. You may think "Dogecoiners" are dumb, but "Bitcoiners" are pretentious and arrogant. Arrogance has toppled many market leaders, only to be overtaken by their rivals.

I don't need a history lesson you idiot. My point has never been about the war on drugs or whether or not drugs should be legalized. I can tell this must be a passion of yours though, because you take every opportunity to point out that you don't thing they should be illegal. I don't give a shit. My only concern is the image of this technology. I want to make sure my investment is worth something at all in a few years, and a profit would be nice! All I know is, the demographic we need to take this thing from mediocre to through the roof is your average every day person. Stop saying we don't need them. It makes you sound stupid. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:07:40
The fact that you are putting bitcoin up there with those iconic brands just shows narcissism and how pretentious this community can be. Bitcoin hasn't "made it" yet. There's still a long way to go, and promoting stories like this will not attract the demographic Bitcoin needs to be successful.

That many coins could secretly and anonymously fund black ops for decades once the government enevitably gives bitcoin it's blessing and the price skyrockets. There's a reason we'll never find out when these were sold or to who, because they're probably sitting in a CIA wallet somewhere. Our government may be full of criminals, but they aren't stupid. If there's a way they can use bitcoin to their advantage, they will.

Most immigrants don't have bank accounts, so no way to purchase bitcoin at the moment. Once there are prepaid coinbase giftcards you can buy at walmart or ATMs more places, that could be a major seller.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:46:39
This brand strategy talk is great! ...Meanwhile, the number one topic on the bitcoin sub is a post advertising bitcoin shaped drugs. This community has a serious culture and brand image problem if it wants to be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:12:31
I'm not surprised that someone would do this. I'm surprised the community is celebrating it on the front page. There's a big difference between what is done and what is publicly condoned.
