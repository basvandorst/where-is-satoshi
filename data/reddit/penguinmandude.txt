Don't listen to him Zan.  This is a terribly shitty situation for everyone involved...us as users, for you personally, and Bitfinex as a company.  The communication being as open as possible is 100% better than being left in the dark.  I'd rather it take some time to carefully analyze the situation and come up with a thought out solution than a quick rash announcement that could blow up and make everything worse.  That said, I think we need at least some new information within the next ~12 hours or we as a community will start getting very restless.
Thank you for being so active and patient with us.  I can't begin to imagine the stress that you and the team are under.

Yeah I don't understand this.  What's the point of multisig if they authorize every transaction.

If finex can recover from this, Bfxcoin could actually be a good investment.

Zan is the community manage and head of product (or something like that) at bitfinex.  He used to work at okcoin. IMO he's been doing a great job keeping everyone informed and answering questions.  He's literally made hundreds of comments since this fiasco begun.  There's some info he's not providing (like how the hack happened since there's a current investigation with law enforcement and how they are handling withdraws/losses/etc. since they haven't finalized decision s yet and he doesn't want to make a rash statement) but I think he's providing as much info as he legally can.

Which requires 51% of miners to agree for them not to be confirmed....which would be a 51% attack

Actually...kind of, yeah.  They're stored offline in a secure place and requires people with the right access to grab them and place them in the hot wallet.  That's the point of cold storage....

God it took me forever to find, almost gave up.  Just place a link right below the article title!!

What are you supposed to do?  I gave all information and completed all verifications yet coins bought from my bank account still take several days to arrive.  Now I just buy on circle and transfer to coinbase to be able to sell directly to the USD wallet so I can buy coins instantly there that way.

The software will download the history of every single transaction that has happened from the last time it synced to now to check and verify if you have any.  Gonna be 10s of gb's.

How does a market/exchange actually determine the *price.*  I understand it's about how much people value it, but how do they know how much people value it?

Circle is so much simpler.  The weekly limit is low though
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:49:34
I'm convinced the price will go down right after the halvening as there will be no immediate supply/demand effects; however, in the long run I think it will steadily go up (with increasing demand from china and more investment from companies).

Circle's showing $709.02!  Cheers to a good weekend! Hot Damn.

That sentence would make absolutely no sense a few decades ago.

The current Bitcoin market cap is around $12 billion.  No imagine if big hedge funds and companies get behind it.  The market cap could easily go above $1 trillion which would mean $64 thousand per coin.  In my opinion, it's not if, it's when.  Could be in a year or more likely within the 3-10 year span.

Could you give an example of a digital currency?  Genuinely curious

If there entire Core source code is not in the article, then it is not worth reading.  Get with it journalists!!

Careful.  There will likely be a dump right after or right before with people 'buying the rumour, selling the news.'  The halvening is most likely already completely priced in as people have been expecting it for a long time.
Now the longer term effects of it will probably bring it up to $1,500, but it might take some time for the effects of the supply rate dropping to really be noticed
