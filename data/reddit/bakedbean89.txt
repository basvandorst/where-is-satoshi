Scam people desperate for an answer in this troubled, troubled world?

I consider this a likely scenario as well, barring major news.
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:26:58
Not a claim just a hunch per OP. I think there may be some good and productive regulatory news coming.

r/politics is a toxic cesspool of loony lefty groupthink. Not missing anything.

Agreed, cheers mate!

There will be two runs in 2018. The larger of the two later this year will reach $17k

Just a hunch, no one has any back up for anything. Remember that.

I actually have BloodButt alerts on trading view, signals last night and this morning to buy.

I agree with OP. It seems more and more transactions require a third party application to do anything, weakening the argument for crypto. Looking for increased adoption to kick this venture into gear without this crap.

I don't see how those are conflicting ideas. One is a subreddit, the other a digital currency. It is possible to rationally treat them differently.

Can I get your gasoline dealer's number?
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:30:28
Why? Not that hard. It’s like your social security number or any other passcode.
