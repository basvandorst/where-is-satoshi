just think of it this way: if someone found a way to double their money, of any sort and currency, every day, they would not need you or you money and would certainly not publish the fact that they can do it.

I got mine in small chunks prior to august and I just kept thinking while buying in at this slow pace, why the fuck didn't I buy them 100 when I had the chance back in 2012...
After I have gotten myself a whole Bitcoin, I felt satisfied yet it's still there at the back of my head; I could have bought a house today if only I had the cahunas back then...
Now I just want more and sadly theres a fat chance of that happening since I have much more obligations in life and much less available funds...

The real question is where were all these fucking 'analysts' before the sub prime broke our pensions backs?? where are they now with all the shitload of worse than trash CLO's the banks are selling right now and since the sub prime crisis, as legit obligations???

That’s really cool indeed but If I am not mistaken they have been for some time now.

Im sorry, but was Bitcoin really made to replace all fiat currencies? or provide an alternative eco system that co exists? Asking for real..
