Nice idea. It will work great with some cogeneration power supply. Over-generated electricity will power esp. on standalone systems :)

I totally understand. I just thought about that I need a single access node I have to rely on.

I think so. Just because I see problems beared by €. There allways will be differences between people. 
Cryptos are the best way out. Best way to create their own monetary system and not be a slave of one managed under very different conditions.

There is already quadgeneration (electricity, heat, cold, CO2), it is great for sustainable greenhouses. With mining rig it will generate +heat +BTC.

Thanks for service suggestions. So I need some trusted third party service (it's something like card terminal provider analogy) in every case?

I must have a look. Thx. I am really fan of these multipurpose efficient things and never heard about it (our country is quite far from a sea)

In my opinion there will be thousands of cryptos or much more (based on same state-of-art technology (like cars, planes, phones nowadays)). But it will be very diversified. Why? Because noone wants to bear problems of people with nothing in common. Crypto is very cheap and robust way how to create solid private/community money.
