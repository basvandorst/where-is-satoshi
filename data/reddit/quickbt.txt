Hey there,
Fine by us! We're just doing our job to bring more people into Bitcoin for the last year. While I can't comment on our new competitors too much, we've found higher limits to be unsustainable due to rampant fraud. This is why debit/credit for Bitcoin has always failed in the past.
At this time, we don't support New Zealand yet. I just wanted to add to the discussion in case any Canadians were here.

To clarify, QuickBT does not want to accept money from anyone for mining, we aren't looking for additional revenue from this. This is also not supposed to be about QuickBT - we'd actually like an answer to our question and if there isn't one yet would offer to help create an open source solution.
To answer your question: We are turning a profit on the back of the Bitcoin network and want to help improve the health of the network (since it appears there is an issue). 
How we can improve the health of the network is the topic of the discussion and hopefully some positive ideas can come out of it. 
Disagreeing is cool too though, everyone to their own.

Great! I think there's a three-prong approach with this method:
1) The code that makes it easy for businesses to donate portions of profit
2) A single landing page that explains why businesses should do this and has the link for the code / instructions (github is a good base but average Bitcoin business owners need a clean one pager)
3) A simple "1% for decentralization" badge businesses can display and consumers can look for - indicating that business supports and gives back to the decentralization model
We'd be happy to work on 2 and 3 if you (or anyone) can help make number 1 easy for technical and non-technical Bitcoin businesses.
Still open to hear other methods too but this looks like a good start so far.
Edit: We'd want this concept to be open source and not for profit in any way if QuickBT was to be involved in creating it.

Nope! At one point they determined our withdrawals were "spam" and put our account into spam mode with no warning. We had about 60 withdrawals in queue before we figured out what was happening.
We've had withdrawals queued before for up to 9 hours, when their hot wallet had run out - in fairness it was on one of the crazy days.
They sent us the explanation of why we were flagged and how withdrawals would be processed (they did about 1 every 4 hours) but never responded to our pleas to "just have our Bitcoin in one lump sum withdrawal". We immediately moved all new sales to other exchanges but took about 4 days to get all the BTC out to customers.

Hi there,
Just reading through this thread and thought I could clear something up for you - INTERAC Online actually does not provide the account holders name. Unfortunately, there is no way to know any details about the payment you are receiving other than the amount and status.
In fact, INTERAC E-Transfers are actually more secure due to this - the email the recipient receives does contain the sender's full name as the email "From Name".
Hope this helps,

Hi there,
OP from the other day - this is sweet!!
I've sent in our first 1%, which represents an undisclosed period of time (for obvious reasons):
We'll do this once a week going forward thanks to you!
I had two requests:
1) It seems we can only donate to the third decimal place - is there a technical reason for this?
2) Thinking about outside integrations - is it possible to to respond with a JSON version? Then anyone could integrate by submitting the POST request with JSON=true and receiving back a JSON response with the donation address.
You also made a great landing page which explains everything!
I've whipped up a little graphic we're using as a placeholder at the bottom of our site until we (or anyone in this subreddit :) can make a beauty.
Finally, you've already made a comment about wondering why the P2Pool uptake is so low in general - here's my take: 
It's just harder than the competition. Any tiny barrier to entry or confusion is perpetuated in lower usage. A nice easy process for Joe Six Pack goes quite a long way, and that probably has more of a weight on GHash then we think. My first interaction with P2Pool was a wall of text explaining technical things.. Let's get something more friendly in place! I'm happy to help.
Again, thanks for this. If anyone here thinks this is a good way to make P2Pool more competitive, ask your favourite Bitcoin business to join in.

Hi there,
First off, check out QuickBT.com to buy your first Bitcoin - it's the easiest way to buy Bitcoin Now.
There's really 3 things you'll want to explore:
1) Cold Storage - You've got your blockchain wallet, which gave you your first Bitcoin address. Blockchain keeps a copy of the"Private Key" for that address so you can send/receive Bitcoin once you buy some. Think of the private key like a bearer-bond - effectively that key IS your Bitcoin. When you're using your first Bitcoin address from Blockchain, you don't need to actually see the key.
In contrast, if you want to see and control the key yourself - check out "Cold Storage" and specifically "Paper wallets" - you should practice sending Bitcoin to a paper wallet and redeeming the paper wallet. A paper wallet is just a piece of paper that has a Bitcoin address and it's Private Key written on it. Remember: Bitcoin addresses are semi-disposable, so you can generate an infinite* amount of paper wallets.
2) Mobile App - Get yourself the mobile app for Blockchain. It makes it easy to send/receive Bitcoin on the go. Get a friend setup and practice sending Bitcoin between yourselves.
3) Buy/Donate something small - Either online or in person, use your Blockchain app to buy a product or donate to a great cause. Use coinmap.org to find places in person or bitgivefoundation.org to find a worthy cause.

Customers buy Bitcoin from QuickBT.com 24/7 and we broadcast transactions automatically. In fact, based on our busy volume, our transactions have likely been in almost every block for the last 18 months+
Instead of using a fixed network fee when broadcasting transactions, QuickBT's Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 node uses the txconfirmtarget feature. 
We set txconfirmtarget to 1, and our node estimates the fee needed to get into the next block. 
If you set it to 2 or 3, it will estimate the fee to get into the 2nd or 3rd block from now, respectively.
We also set a maxtxfee and a fallbackfee, just in case.
Our customers enjoy fast confirmation times and can spend their Bitcoin sooner!

Hi there,
Thanks for your interest in QuickBT!
It's true - TD is implementing a new system which limits consumer choice for purchasing online. With this new system, customers can only buy online using the Visa network, not the INTERAC network as INTERAC is rolling out. Offline, the Visa and INTERAC networks compete healthily, but online, Visa is potentially forming a monopoly.
Unfortunately, INTERAC Online purchases are much more secure, meaning we can only accept them as payment. Visa purchases can be easily reversed, and even if we could mitigate the issue, Visa will not allow us to accept their cards.
Few options here. The first is to tell your branch you're not comfortable with your chequing account being Visa enabled. Should a fraudulent charge go through on the Visa part (anywhere in the world), scheduled payments like car/mortgage/rent could bounce before you notice. You are covered for the money, but not for the inconvenience. Personally, this is why I don't have a Visa Debit. I use a Visa Credit, and only risk my available credit. The branch may issue you standard card for this reason.
Second, RBC has a much better solution and many of our customers have opened up RBC accounts not just to use QuickBT but also to avoid any risks of Visa Debit. With RBC, you are always issued a standard client card. You have the option to receive a second, Visa Debit card, which is linked to your chequing account. This means you have access to either online payment network from your chequing account.
Hope this helps and please let me know if we can do anything else,

Effectively, it's plain text to us, and you need to trust our company with your card number. Unlike QuickBT.com (our sister site), where we have no access to decrypt your financial data.
The reason we mention not being able to use "just the card number" is to re-assure customers that we are not doing anything else with the card. It's a valid concern if they're giving us their card number.
Our PCI compliance comment here makes little sense - it's two topics strung into one and clearly shows our rushing to answer this morning. PCI compliance is not a requirement for us, we have no agreement with Visa and our current infrastructure likely meets/exceeds it. I'll admit in previous credit card implementations (before I found Bitcoin a few years ago), I've always used a hosted solution to process, so I haven't needed a detailed knowledge of the PCI compliance documentation. Since fighting Bitcoin fraudsters/hackers for years with QuickBT.com, I suspect we're well equipped to handle anything a Visa card number could throw at us. We'll have an update on this soon since our customers want to see us say "PCI compliant" and we certainly respect that. The second point is us commenting again on value of just card number data, similar to our point above about us not abusing them, but has no bearing on how we store this password-like data.
Hope this helps, thanks for looking out, and we look forward to another round of feedback early next week if you'd give it to us. $5 Jamie

I agree! However whenever we onboard new people into Bitcoin, they also want to know how to sell if there ever wanted to.
Now, they have the comfort of knowing they can sell their Bitcoin directly to their chequing (Visa Debit) or Visa Credit -- even if they never have to!

Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback! Not much sleep last night and reddit don't mix!
We're not storing credit card numbers in plain text, we can access them in plain text so we can make the payment. As opposed to us passing this information on directly and having no visibility (like QuickBT.com). Apologies for the confusion.

Hi there,
Thank you for your repeat business!
I do apologize you feel that way. We do outline our costs right on our homepage.
Our business has aimed to be sustainable from day 1. Many Bitcoin businesses have had to shut their doors because they could not generate the revenue to cover their entire costs. We also only process smaller amounts, so each order only generates cents in profit.
When we opened we charged 16% to make sure we could cover costs and fraud. Now we charge $1.25 + 4.99%, and are still working to get this lower. You can buy as little as $3 worth of Bitcoin in seconds, with minimal verification, so many people find it to be a good value proposition.
Hope to earn your business back in the future as we improve our rates,

None with the API muscle we need. Bitstamp is our number two, but their API is weaker and they don't deal in CAD so more conversion cost. Really looking forward to the VirtEx API.

Hi deweydb,
What issues are you experiencing? Can't seem to replicate any major issue.
We're using godaddy dedicated hosting since we just launched. Very interested in upgrading once we build our business.
Thanks for the feedback,
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:58:20
To give you some insight - if an extra step was REQUIRED unconditionally (user might get to choose what it is), it would break many parts of their API. By allowing their API to automatically make withdrawals, their system can be integrated into others. Include QuickBT's.
@_date: 2013-08-15 18:08:40
Hi bitbea, Due to uptime issues with Mt Gox we are in the process of switching to Bitstamp. Mt Gox will act as a back up. Once the cavirtex API is stable, we'll try and bring those prices to our customers too. Look for updates on Reddit shortly! QuickBT Team
Edit: And thanks for the kind words!
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:11:54
That's why we're asking the public / actual customers to do it for us. Either they'll agree we're an answer, or they won't.
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:52:57
Our target is 4% - makes us extremely competitive and a no-brainer.
It's going to take sales to get there though. During our beta and launch week, we're at 11%. Interac Fees-&gt;Bank Fees-&gt;Mt.Gox Fees included.
Also: we need to feel out the chargeback landscape. Is keeping a low limit going to make us unattractive to thieves? Why steal $40 from a bank account, if you can get hundreds from an ATM? 
Time will tell if it works.
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:13:43
Hi WuCris,
Thank you for your interest in QuickBT!
We support an Interac product called "Interac Online". This is different from Interac E-Transfers (using email). Interac Online is just for paying registered businesses. Because it is newer than E-Transfers, support is limited to a few major banks.

We have an integrated banking network in Canada (Interac) since there's only a few banks, so customers actually log into their online banking as part of the checkout. 0.4BTC/day max, so our fee ends up being a buck or two.

Absolutely correct. We need a physical device (employee terminal + customer screen + receipt printer) like those little credit card terminals today. Employees have limited permissions, and customers will recognize it as a potential payment medium.
Right now most of the merchant options for accepting Bitcoin are clearly designed for sole proprietors.
Side note: Thank you Coinbase for subsidizing Bitcoin's growth with this incentive!!

A) Bitcoin has no single point of failure other than the whole Internet
B) We use a fiat merchant provider, and they are down. Meaning our business has come to a grinding halt because of them.
C) Interac is a MASSIVE banking system in Canada that the debit monopoly - they're probably losing millions of dollars an hour over this

Hi SomeoneOnTheInternet,
Thank for your interest in QuickBT.
Our business model was designed from the chargebacks up. Although our service seems simple, we actually have several layers of chargeback mitigation. From integrating your bank's online banking - to low daily limits - to verifying your non-voip Canadian cell phone. We still do assume some risk, but our business plan allows us to absorb some losses (we've seen zero since launch in August). 
If we can do this right, we can stick around and keep guiding people into the Bitcoin community.
Hopefully this answers your question,

Hi there,
Thank you for your business and patience!
Are you still having trouble? I don't see any outstanding support tickets. It's odd that 48 hours would go by without your ticket being answered, but if there was a problem with your order and we hadn't received a ticket about it until 24-36 hours later, 48 hours could go by. I do apologize for the trouble.
Did you receive the automatic reply letting you know we've created a ticket?

Hi transisto,
Great question, there's a number of reasons:
1) Chargeback immunity - we are able to eat $50 losses, not $2000
2) Money Laundering - Identity controls begin at $3k a month, at $50/day all customers have a grand max of $1500/month
3) Illicit purchases - We want to distance ourselves from illegal activity, and having a small limit makes us deliberately unattractive. 
We do hope to explore ways to raise our limit, as we understand the usefulness if we did. 
Look for updates in the future!

Over our first week we've processed over $900 worth of Bitcoin. We have had no chargebacks or even suspicious charges (yet).
We paid out 1 major vulnerability which was fixed within 12 hours of notification.
We tipped out .7 over 4 minor vulnerabilities.
We've built-in redundancies in case Mt. Gox doesn't respond to some commands.
We've built Bitstamp support! We'll be replacing Mt Gox once Bitstamp adds one tiny feature to their API (which they've promised us).
Thank you Canada! We'll keep you up to date on our progress.

Thank you for your answers! As I outlined elsewhere, we'd love it if you gave your Credit Union a call and politely let them know you'd be interested in "Interac Online". Most Credit Unions already support Email Money Transfers, so they already have a relationship with Interac.

I did this as well - I'm assuming that's what is meant by including the order number in transaction. Honestly if I was using a native or mobile client I wouldn't have been able to do this. OP should give each customer a unique price like 0.0298375, everything past two decimals is the order number :)

@_date: 2013-09-11 23:59:35
We'd make it very obvious. It will be listed at the beginning and simply offered as an additional payment option at the bottom, to the right of the Interac button. We're also adding a description below each button. The first time you try to PAD, it asks for a picture of the cheque and your digital signature on the PAD agreement. Once it's processed, you pick up where you left off, and agree to the purchase from your bank account. We know who you are because you've already verified a PIN at that point.
The flow will be kind of like what Interac is doing for us now, except built all in-house :)

The concept is to let the customer make a payment with their payment processor of choice. Then the payment processing company has to earn relationships with customers, not merchants. The Merchant then doesn't put up with ANY hassles with sign ups, merchant accounts etc.

Hi there,
Thank you for your interest in QuickBT! Just wanted to clarify some of our pricing so you'd understand.
Rather than show a really low sub-total and tack on deposit fees, USD conversion fees, wire transfer fees, trading fees and withdrawal fees, **we simply show the grand total**. Although this bites us when compared directly to the competition's sticker price, we think it's much more fair since what you see is what you pay.
We're working on a little comparison chart so you can see just how competitive QuickBT is compared to other buying services, breaking down the original price, all the fees and the grand total. The best place to get the cheapest price is always a true Bitcoin exchange; however that carries all the additional verification and deposit delays, compared to our instant no-waiting service. We also allow customers to take advantage of price dips without waiting for deposits, 24 hours a day.
Also, QuickBT is very helpful for newcomers to Bitcoin since it breaks the barriers major exchanges create.
Appreciate your feedback and hopefully we can earn your business one day,

Gotcha - we send users a PIN number to verify their unique cell phone, then we request the same PIN on our site - allows us to control who's using the service. 
Doesn't sound like we're susceptible to any major flaws. And before you ask, we do a carrier lookup to block voip forwarding services :)

Check this draft out: 
@_date: 2013-10-27 14:06:08
1) Safely create paper wallets (crucial)
2) Make a transaction from coinjar to that paper wallet address
3) Keep paper wallets safe like cash
4) When ready to spend, you'll spend each paper wallet in it's entirety
1) Visit bitaddress.org and notice the "paper wallet" tab. Bitcoin addresses are very much like gift cards with an account number and secret code on the back. Paper wallets have both these codes printed on them. That's all they are.
You can print right from this page if you want, however it's important to note that the point of paper wallets is to keep the secret code (private key) hidden from anyone including your computer and internet.
Best bet is to save the source code of that page to a USB key, find a fresh computer not on the internet, connect it to an old school printer, and then generate and print your paper wallets. Print a few just in case and spread out your money over them. Or ask someone who understands the above to do it for you.
If you don't generate your paper wallets securely, they could be compromised.
2) Use coinjar to send money to each of the paper wallets. The wallets have a familiar public key on them, so just send money to it like you were sending to a store or friend.
3) Now those Bitcoins are assigned to those pieces of paper. You need the private key printed on the paper to spend them. If you lose the paper, it's gone.
4) When you want to spend, you'll either give the wallets to someone or import the private key into a software wallet. In each case, you are moving the entire denomination on the paper wallet. This is why it's handy to spread out your coins onto multiple wallets.

Hi there,
We are still accepting TD classic Interac cards. It does seem TD is pushing away from them however, so I can't promise that we will forever.
Our bank support is really up to "Interac Online" - which is the checkout product we use.

Hi Ravagedsavage,
At QuickBT we've been working hard to make Bitcoin accessible to everyone. To do this, we've incurred considerable start up and on-going costs. So yes, we charge a small markup to run our business (which is far less than a normal retail markup). In return, we offer convenience, speed and customer service to all.

Hi there,
Thank you for your business!
When the markets are super volatile like they are today, our exchange starts having uptime issues.
Rest assured as long as you received a receipt your Bitcoin has been secured, your price is guaranteed, and as long as your verification is complete your order will be delivered.
PS - Once your verified with us, your orders will be instant as long as the exchanges are up.
Thanks again,

Hi vbuterin,
Our fee certainly isn't comparable to purchasing Bitcoins yourself. So yes, it will be higher. However, the cost of learning about Bitcoin, securing Bitcoin, and risking having your Bitcoins stolen is quite high for the average consumer.
We think our "higher" fee is worth the value.
Our budgeted chargeback expense is 2% of every transaction. Industry considers anything higher than 1 (very high) to be unacceptable. Once we have a good indicator of chargeback rates, we will re-forecast our budget to reflect that.
@_date: 2013-09-12 19:55:16

Hi obi-nine, this is definitely a valid concern, and that's interesting to note for the future. Here's an excerpt from our Business Plan:
Chargebacks have consistently presented a challenge for Bitcoin since Bitcoin is irreversible. QuickBT’s mandate is overcoming these challenges. Here’s our defence:
i)	Small payments only:
Daily person limit poises minimal risk, at less than $50
ii)	Canada only: 
More confirmed identity liability
iii)	Utilize all provided security features:
Interac Checkout, Integrated Bank Security
iv)	Implement next-generation security:
SMS authentication, IP filtering, Captcha, Error Handling
v)	Immediate delivery &amp; usage:
Customer will know if there is any issue right away
vi)	Notes inline on customer’s account records:
“QuickBT Final Sale……….$10.84”
vii)	Budget extra chargebacks:
Business Plan is liberal on chargeback costs

Thanks for your help! I mean you buy something online, it comes right out of your bank account. As opposed to a "credit" transaction which you are billed for at a later date. A debit system piggybacks on bank security, and is considered more "final". Would GiroPay match this description?
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:16:06
No, and I'd be fine with web accounts having forced two-factor something. But when I enable two-factor on my account, my api withdrawal stops working :(

Hi skrazy,
The reason we've used that term is because the legality of bitcoin itself is still without strong precedent. 
While our service has been approved, accepted, and guaranteed by Interac and the Bank of Montreal, we wanted to let customers know that they are also under these various jurisdictions.
As we seek more professional legal advice, our terms will be updated to reflect our precise legal commitments.
Thanks for your point though, maybe a better word should be in it's place.
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:49:27
We would like to add that TD has dropped support for Interac Online (QuickBT's payment processor) - BMO, Scotiabank and RBC would love your business!

Thank you for your non-legal advice suggestion - if we decide to process these types of requests, we will request police reports and file additional ones ourselves.
@_date: 2013-08-18 23:30:11
Is the payment instant? Do German online retailers integrate GiroPay into their checkout? So:
1. Checking out online
2. User redirected to their online banking to pay
3. User redirected back to online store's thank you page
Have you ever done this yourself?
Yes we are looking into it! Very few countries in the world have an integrated banking payment system, which QuickBT requires (as opposed to using a less secure "credit" system).
@_date: 2013-09-11 03:36:14
Hi there,
We're curious: As a customer turned away by bank-incompatibility, would you pay a $2 extra fee to do a pre-authorized debit (PAD, using the numbers on a void cheque)? We're contemplating adding this but it's expensive for customers.
QuickBT Team
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:26:17

Hi there,
One option you do have is to call VanCity and ask them to opt-in to the Interac Online program. Since they already deal with Interac for Email Money Transfers, it's likely easy for them if there's enough customer interest.
We'll reach out to them as well,

We're going to check this out - best kept secret if it's true!
@_date: 2013-08-10 22:53:20
We knew this question would come up so thank you! We are interested in getting the best rates for our customers. A few points for us when selecting a market:
1) API Support:
Mt Gox has a full-featured API. Even BTC-E and Bitstamp's API's are not as powerful (instant withdrawal etc). CaVirtEx has indicated they are near completion of their API, which we'll be following closely.
2) Multi-currency:
Mt Gox supports a variety of currencies which will help with global growth.
3) Future Reliability:
Mt Gox has indicated they are heavily investing into their system and will likely be the most reliable of the exchanges going forward (given their position and accumulated strength).
4) Price: Mt Gox's fees are much better than CaVirtEx. Once the price difference evens out, we think the choice is clear.
That being said - we are very interested in having redundant suppliers throughout our chain - from Interac Acquirers to Bank Accounts to Bitcoin Exchanges - we plan to double/triple up to avoid downtime.
Look for updates on this soon! (We want the best price too)

@_date: 2013-08-23 16:17:10
For the average Joe or Bitcoin owner, yes. However those who have made significant gains on Bitcoin may not want to convert to fiat. Takes time.
When we opened we charged 12% to feel out the market, as time goes on we'll keep reducing our rates (6% now). We're sure CoinFueled will do the same if they feel they need to.

@_date: 2013-09-19 19:02:30
Sweet - what happens if the BTC price fluctuates between the start and end of the wire transfer? I guess the business gets what they get on the day the wire transfer is received?
@_date: 2013-08-27 12:25:32
VISA is certainly trying to take some of Interac's turf - We don't think it's good for Canadians or competition. Our understanding is that card-present transactions still go through the Interac Network.
If you're with CIBC or TD, using debit, on a card-not-present transaction, THEN it goes through the VISA network similar to a credit charge, that comes straight out of your bank account. I guess that appeals to teenagers and those with bad credit - however they could always use prepaid VISAs.
Does anyone else have a better understanding?

Hi nupogodi,
Thank you for your interest in QuickBT.
You raise a valid point - for the initiated, a full-serve option doesn't always make financial sense. However, if you're ever introducing someone to Bitcoin and they want to buy a little to try it out with you over their shoulder, QuickBT is your best risk-free option. Once they are comfortable, we too recommend visiting exchanges or LocalBitcoins.

Hi ChevalNervous,
Thank you for your interest in QuickBT.
Our merchant provider is aware of and has approved our business model. 
Unfortunately, Visa/MasterCard/Paypal/Google Wallet explicitly prohibit currency exchange businesses (fiat or crypto).

We are actively looking to be granted an official exception, but need to tread carefully on behalf of our customers.

Hi poopytoopy681,

Unfortunately, Visa's new deal with TD and CIBC for debit cards means that VISA processes all online transactions for these cards.

We currently support RBC, BMO and Scotiabank. Small Business and legacy TD cards are also accepted.

Hi elan96,
Wallets are generated using a math algorithm. As long as it matches the algorithm, the address/private key is valid. This means we can generate addresses offline and never have the private key see the light of day.
When you load the "offline" address with coin, the transaction will will be online and public on the blockchain. But the blockchain doesn't verify that the address has been "initiated" etc. It just knows it's a valid address created with that algorithm.
And since you'll ask, no, you can't generate the same address twice. The number of possible addresses doesn't have a word.

3) Were you using Interac Email Money Transfer? If so, that's a personal product, not a business product, and the chargeback process is different as we are a registered business.

Any business that accepts plastic (Visa, MasterCard, Debit) does so through a Payment Service Provider. Ours is Admeris. Think of them as the gateway to the big brands. Here's the workflow from our site and back:
2)Admeris Confirmation Page
3)Interac Bank Selection
4)Bank Specific User Experience
5)Clickthrough quickly: Interac, Admeris, QuickBT, (redir for our merchants)

BMO, Scotiabank and RBC customers have already been upgraded to "Interac Online".

Remember: they crux of paper wallets is that the private key printed on them is a total secret to everyone but you. To spend them once, implies using the key in some software to do so, and therefore is no longer 100% secret.
You can, of course, re-load the paper wallets. However the point of them is kind-of ruined at that point since an online computer or phone has seen the goods. It's best to consider them disposable.
EDIT: You can freely load your paper wallets as many times as you want without worry. Just only spend from it once. Eg. you have more coins later and want to paper them, just add them one existing paper wallets.
