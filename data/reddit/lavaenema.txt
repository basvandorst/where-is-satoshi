I was referring to the one with 3.5M BTC received. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:00:07
How do you know that this address belongs to Bitfinex and not the hacker? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:32:37
Move along. Nothing to see here.

Are BTCUSD positions held by those lending out BTC or lending out USD? 
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:58:32
How many and which European authorities? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:00:22
Dang, they mentioned another loss as a dramatic closer, citing $600k in losses. The loss this time around is a full two orders of magnitude more severe. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:36:33
These are not the only two choices with which they are faced, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:07:40
Why would they? According to their own statements, the "customers" suffered losses when funds were removed from  "segregated accounts."
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:24:22
Absolutely no way it stays at or even near $1.

Enter unaffected whales. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:29:27
How big was the loss and what time frame was involved? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:45:42
Yes. God knows what happened to my balance. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:35:48
Hey remember that time you were forced to use dollars to buy yet to be created tokens because some other existing tokens got taken from the guardian of your dollars? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:44:47
Thanks for the info. Is this the reply to which you are referring? If so, I'm afraid that I'm not as optimistic about this as you are. He appears to be guessing. 
BTW what would an IOU look like in this case? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:30:21
It's likely a language thing. A 36% and change loss leaves you with 63% and change balance. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:25:27
Out of curiosity, what do you see as the threshold for acceptable losses? I'm personally in the 15% range, or roughly 1yr of gains from interest. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:09:27
Why do you expect the CSO, for example, to voluntarily contribute to our losses? (his funds on the exchange notwithstanding, but even then, I doubt he'd be sharing in our losses). 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:29:11
Let's go with "least worst"
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:49:24
Would the reverse be true as well? Margin funding (BTC) clients who lent out BTC transferred the liability to the trader shorting Bitcoin, and the original lender will be made whole in USD at $604/BTC? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:04:56
Do we believe that Bitfinex has 340k BTC worth of assets to make such a claim? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:15:59
The alternative may very well be bankruptcy proceedings whereby your dollars and his bitcoins would be treated equally and indiscriminately some five years down the line, and some percentage lower in value after fees have piled up.

In a nanny state, they are entirely culpable. Kind of like McDonald's is liable for us getting fat.

Now, what say you about his mother?

Here, have a snickers. You get feministy when you're hungry. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:55:36
HFCS is in all kinds of foods that we consume, from groceries to canned drinks.. not just fast food. I will agree with your core point that this is one of the driving forces behind obesity, but laying the blame on McDonald's for one's big gut is bullshit. Dietary fat doesn't make you fat; caloric surplus makes you fat. 
Besides, poor people generally don't eat at McDonald's since it's more cost effective to shop at Walmart (or similar) instead. Consider being allotted $100/mo to feed yourself, would you go to McDonald's regularly?

If the mafia had a get together and the boss wanted his nephew  Joey to make a website so they can expand their operations to the "world wide web," then their business model would be indistinguishable from Yelp's.

When it comes to bitcoin, I've heard the "it doesn't happen overnight" argument so many times that I have no choice but to be weary when it's made nowadays. There will be a time, however long in the future, when this will no longer be a valid argument. Its purpose will only be to curb criticism. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:50:24
If a consumer says that, it's ridiculous. If a government says that, it's the norm.

You have been lied to, and what's worse, you believed the lies. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:24:11
It makes more sense where instead of calling them "questions," we refer to them with a more descriptive and correct phrase: field collection of evidence against you. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:05:53
No, the one with your name and private key on it.

I'll hold off until they implement transferable paper wallets. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:54:26
Please edit your original comment if it is misleading. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:41:02
Exactly that. I'll play around with it and post if it looks decent.

Q1 revenues are up as a result of increased sales of drugs. Q1 expenses are also up due to increased buying of drugs.

Is your username on localbitcoins.com directly related to your email address? Is your email listed on any ads, or have you used it to contact other members in such a way that they would be able to harvest it?

I'm seeing a commercial with that idea. Something like Snickers "hungry? why wait?" but with amateur terrorists and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:11:19
It's interesting how you expressed the inevitable value of the dollar as zero dollars. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:08:42
Hmm.. how can bitcoin be used to certify authenticity of an archive like this? Trustless and all that jazz.

The only benefit for the receiver in this case is protections against potential chargebacks (compared to PP). The sender has little incentive.

OP's question serves to lead you into disproving your own argument that the driving force behind the increase in price is rooted in "fundamentals."

Please be advised that this project is not new nor is is the only one. That guy's idea was not exactly original, so you can't say that he has no luck. You can, however, say that he has no timing.

The losses add value to all other coins, but as you mentioned, there may come a time where there isn't any value to add because of those same losses.
@_date: 2015-10-21 04:30:29

It is disingenuous to measure the level of impact in Bitcoin. Measure it him fiat at the time of reward reduction.
