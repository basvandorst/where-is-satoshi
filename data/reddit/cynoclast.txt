The sole criterion for the viability of a currency is wide acceptance. Wether or not a country 'offically' recognizes it actually has surprisingly little importance.
Zimbabwe dollars were official, and worth less than toilet paper.

No I pointed out the sole criterion for the viability of a currency.
I didn't compare a currency to an economy.

Virtual means not real, which is a synonym of fake. Given that stores and businesses across the country accept it, and ATMs dispense it, it's misleading to call it a "virtual" currency. It's just a currency, or if you want to be really technically accurate, a distributed crypto-currency.

Yes, it is. Capitalism is doing anything you can get away with to make more profit. This includes bribery, lying, having laws written to favor your business, avoiding as much tax as possible, lying to the customer as much as you profitably can etc.


You mean like ALEC? Crony capitalism is the part of capitalism you don't want to admit is there, but that changes nothing about the reality of it.

Because it's become a subsystem of the banking and monetary system.
At least in the US. The government lost control of its currency and therefore - literally - its sovereignty just over 100 years ago.

Bitcoin isn't "virtual" anymore than electronic, high frequency trading of USD is. Bitcoin is a distributed cryptocurrency. It's a subtle word game intended to discredit bitcoin.

No, because the the currency is highly trustworthy itself. And to the laymen, trust-less implies they can't trust it. I know what you mean, you don't have to trust the sender, but that's calling it trust-less would do more harm than good, IMHO.

So? They have no authority over it. This is the same government that bailed out too big to fail banks and failed to prosecute anyone responsible for the financial crisis.

By usurping the biased, centralized, debt-with-usury-based banking and monetary system that is the linchpin to controlling the capitalist dystopia that we live in and replacing it with something that treats everyone the same and does not require lopsided indebtedness for the borrower and profit for the lender for economic growth of the system that all benefit from.
I don't know that it would be bitcoin, but distributed cryptocurrencies such as litecoin and dogecoin could very well be the key to economic freedom and equalization.
Remember, the sole criterion for the viability of a currency is acceptance. We don't need approval from banks, investors, the Federal Reserve System, the IMF or any authoritarian system for it to work. Just use it, and accept it. You have both of those powers.

The sole criterion for the viability of a currency is acceptance. Bitcoin is accepted in a fuckton of places now. Banks don't like it when people play monopoly with money they don't control. They stand to lose their primma donna position of being able to make more money and charge interest for the privilege.
@_date: 2016-01-11 02:42:23
Of course not. Bitcoin threatens to usurp their control of the economy. It's not a federal reserve note, and it's not a petrodollar. Yet it has value as a currency.
They're not stupid.

Misdirection, mud slinging, and then you wedge your own theory in? That's not really a cogent argument for anything.
That said I think we agree on getting rid of the fed, if for possibly different reasons. I say possibly because I don't know yours.
Better yet, eliminated a debt-based monetary system that fractional reserve banks profit exclusively powerfully from. They're so powerful they set their own business hours.
That is too much power.

It also ties economic growth to the whims of the central bank, ceding them control of economic growth, which effectively cedes them the government because they can bubble/burst/inflate/deflate the entire economy, and it always results in inflation because the amount of money available is artificially controlled by fallible people who have agendas designed to benefit themselves first and foremost. Not to mention that in a debt-based monetary system, the banks profit from 100% of the country's economic growth first. Then, according to "trickle down economics" they use that money ~~for the good of all~~ to further increase their wealth and power.
The other problem is that it centralizes power, making tyranny for cheaper.

Here's a slightly tangential thought:
Instead of linking "your bank account" create multiple accounts, at multiple credit unions (fuck banks), then link to coinbase an account with limited funds. Alternatively, see if your credit union can create an account   that is separate from your other ones.  It's no different to them than a child or spouse account, really.

Bullshit.  A bank's ability to make money is what allows them to pay interest on deposits. And I don't know if you checked your accounts lately, but the typical interest rate on a retail account is 0.01 - 0.05% APR, which is so far behind inflation as to be an effective LOSS despite the number representing it getting bigger.

It's not a matter of agree/disagree.
They have 1 and loan out 10.
Money they have: 1
Money they loan out: 10
Where did the other 9 come from? The bank does not have it, but they certainly manage to collect interest on this fake money, and the best part is, thanks to compounding usury, not only do you owe them money they created out of thin air to lend to you, but now you owe them more than the original amount!
