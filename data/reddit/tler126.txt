This is a common misconception of America's law system, it's not meant to greatly financially benefit one party or the other -  only determine who is right and wrong. I took a pretty extensive course on it.
The jist of that idea is, if you have to use the court system to solve a dispute and to find who is right, society broke down. Courts should *always* be the last step, because it should be somewhat obvious when someone fucks. We as a society don't want a lot morons suing each other over petty crap, otherwise fewer meaningful cases would be heard. This is how it's supposed to work, and it does pretty well.
Newsweek will probably settle before undertaking this case, so the lawyer is just trying to make money at this point.
Then you get dick-bags like ambulance chasers. In ANY other legal setting you would pay good money just to speak to a lawyer and see if you can/should make a case. Those assholes give you a free consultation to see if they can make money off an incident by squeezing the other party.

Fuck, why didn't he say comparatively low cost and verifiable transactions, he came off as a stupid investor.
EDIT: In regards to the question of, "What Bitcoin offers as an advantage over traditional banking."

I don't care who he picks. This guy has publicly supported a position stating that the IRS needs to be abolished. An idea so stupid it's like saying a flat tax is a good solution to wealth disparity.
Like seriously?! Yeah no one likes taxes, but when a government stops effectively collecting its fair share, they stop being an effective government.

Earlier this year was unemployed for 4 months and down to my last bits of cash.  I sold and made about 4 times my cash  over the two years I held. I'm really considering liquidating my 401k, taking the tax hit, and keeping a positive attitude for another few years. This seems like a price spike, but nothing has convinced me more of the longevity of BTC more than the few months I haven't owned.

I bought 8 of them at $500. Sadly I had to cash out at $2500 when I lost my job earlier this year. I would give pretty much anything to get them back, now that I've downsized and took a cooking job for now.
Hodl FTW folks!

In short, there's a lot of tax disincentive for pulling out of a tax deferred investment.
There is an IRS penalty for withdrawing early (10 or 15 I forget which.) 
Then you also need to report it as income subject to your normal income bracket.
Finally there will be capital gains tax to pay if/when you sell your coins.
