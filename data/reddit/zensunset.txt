Flip a coin.

It's hard for me to determine whether that would work with Big Cartel. Or if there is another method of implementation for his website. I will let him know though. 
Do you know, confidently, that this would work? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:21:46
Humeourous. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:25:58
Why can't we do this in the USA? 
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:54:13
He buys you BTC at market price for a fee. Email him if you have questions. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 08:31:44
Most already know about the Bible. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 09:56:48
On the FAQ, it says he plans on shipping internationally sometime soon. His site just launched last week.

Is there any way to generate addresses with just a few die and some tables?
This would be game-changing.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:31:56
Me too, post details @_date: 2013-12-27 19:12:56
Please post the link here when you do, yea? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:41:29
No. The limit as x goes to infinity of (1/2^x) is 0. The reason the house wins is because they don't let x go to infinity. There is a max bet.

Perhaps the title is a bit misleading, but I put my coins into btc-e using the service. The post is not about btc-e. It's about buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:59:22
Yes please! 
@_date: 2013-12-20 07:19:51
Yup. You're correct. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:33:57
There's no way to own coinbase stock, correct? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:23:10
I deliver. I've been given 2 cents before. If your delivery guy is a dick, then please don't come crying here. 
This would probably brighten up a driver's night. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:18:56
Look what I found! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:33:41
Nope. 
The correct thing for him to do, given that he believed Bitcoin would not succeed, would have been to buy 1 btc on that date. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:26:52
You're probably right. I guess I just figured I'd give it a shot. Bitcoin has been good to me. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:10:22
I just used them today. It was a fantastic experience. Email the owner, Will, at will

@_date: 2013-11-22 03:14:26
The money (usd) that he spends on cat litter could be spent to purchase Bitcoin instead. 
Think of it this way. You've gotta buy goods either way, why not put your money into Bitcoin and let it appreciate while you buy the goods (with btc) you'd usually be buying? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:14:26
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:59:50
Unless that Bible is worth good money, I think that's a bit of a stretch.
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:31:46
Yea. I'd think that the mining thing would be more for fun than anything else, if it ever happened. I certainly would not want it marketed as a way to make money. 
Thanks for the input. :) 
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:09:22
lol, for SR?
EDIT: Sorry if this sounds mean, but I just laughed a little at the thought.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:53:43
Unfortunately, this may be the best solution.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:19:34
I got one of these and I love it. Relevant.
EDIT: Here's the correct link: 
Funny how it was totally irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:40:40
yup yup. Haha, my bad.
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:30:40
I'm 5'10 and 115. I would love to gain some weight. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:20:55
Please post this, I want to hand it out.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:34:57
I think it's still down. The wizard doesnt create a page.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:53:37
Having the machine ready would be a good way to profit if you think regulations will ease up. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:07:23
If you post his address (with proof) I'll send a good amount his way.
@_date: 2013-05-11 08:18:59
If I can help him get it set up, he would probably use something like Bitpay. I introduced him to Bitcoin, but he knows very little other than what I have told him. His site uses something called Big Cartel for all the transactions. Is it possible to get something working on his site? That would be awesome!
If we can do it for him, then we can do it for more small-time business owners like him!
EDIT: Sorry, I realized the title was a bit misleading. I'm asking for help to get something working on the site he owns.
@_date: 2013-07-12 23:32:58
Thanks, these are awesome! 
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:54:57
Anyone heard of Aptera? I was so disappointed. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:16:34
Yea, I came here a bit too late. :/
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:25:58
I have one too. So happy with it! 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:51:57
You're unpleasant. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:27:58
Really? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:03:58
In the US? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:49:46
May I get one as well? The things you're doing look awesome! 
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:10:37
I deliver too, and I would love this! 
@_date: 2013-05-11 07:54:51
Here's the news article: 
Sorry, I assumed it would be on the front page.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:48:12
I trust them more than myself. Haha. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 07:30:55
I love this too! 
@_date: 2013-05-12 08:01:18
Or a pendulum? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:07:13
You don't sound like a n00b to me. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 21:55:19
Email him. Will
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:23:52
Doesn't happen where I work. Have some faith in people. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:21:43
Where do I look?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:19:19
Here's mine if anyone wants to help me get access. :) 
@_date: 2013-05-11 09:39:59
It won't work on his site?
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:09:01
A little about me. I'm a 21 year-old CS Major. I'm a tutor at a local SAT prep business. 
My boss wants me to create a practical course for high school students, which may eventually lead into a course on how to mine bitcoins and other crypto-currencies for those interested. He likes to offer odd classes and keeps those that stick. Knowing that I have some experience with things Bitcoin related, he has asked me to design a course. I may not be the most qualified, but I am in charge of a minor mining operation. Hopefully that is enough information. 
Edit: I have a working draft, but I just want to see what others would do.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:48:00
Holy crap dude! I wanted to buy one of your awesome quilts, but was sad because I have the majority of my funds in Bitcoin (I'm young and I can afford the risk).
So stoked! Wow, what a coincidence!
