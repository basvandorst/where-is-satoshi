You can start by lending them your bitcoins. But be a bro about it, don't intrude on their privacy by asking for ID like some statist stooge, and if they're a little late paying you back, you just let them slide. 
Glad I could help.

Yes, much as it has throughout recorded history. The stock market, otoh, is a market, much like the market where you buy your pork chops. When trust in money goes down, the price of pork (and pork belly futures) goes up. So inverse correlation.

I don't call the police when I use a CC, I call my CC company &amp; get my money back. Just like that. No filing police reports, no waiting for hell to freeze over, no muss, no fuss. Next time you buy something from China with bitcoins, try filing a Chinese police report :D
Clearly you've never used a credit card or dealt with police, which explains pretty much everything.


Either Bitcoin is a real threat to the powers that be, in which case they'll ban it (and your inquiry as to "why would they" is answered), or it's no more of a threat than my vast holdings in Beanie Babies. Either way, you got nothing :)

You mean, I shouldn't use bitcoins as money? I shouldn't trust exchanges, or merchants on the other side of the globe? Makes Bitcoin pretty pointless.
Look, when people send money, be it with a credit card, bitcons, or cash by passenger pigeon, they typically expect something in return -- a laptop, some blow -- "product." For that, they must trust the counterparty --- the h00man on the other end of their "transaction." That's the trust Bitcoin fails to address. And that's why teh *bitcoin space* is overflowing with theft and tears of impotent rage. Like a septic tank :[ 


Lol, if you're talking about credit cards, the money I'm spending isn't mine. It's the money my CC company is trusting me with, a free loan, so no worries there. 
What happens when Chinese government nationalizes all the Bitcoin mines and starts forking your Bitcoin like a read-headed stepchild? Huh? What then? What happens when EU finally drops the ban hammer? :D

Yeah, it does. Give you an example, show you what I mean.
Suppose each block can fit just 1 transaction, and there's an average of 1 transaction every ten minutes, so everything is working fine. Until no blocks are found for 102 minutes, and now teh Guf has a backlog of 10 transactions.
Next block is solved, and now you got a backlog of 9 transactions.
If there was no blocksize limit, you'd have no backlog (because all 10 would be included in that solved block).

When I want to sell stuff, I want it gone and I want to get paid, as quickly and hassle-free as possible. When I'm buying, I want what I want, fast and cheap. 
Now, that p2p thing? You might be overestimating the need. Not once have I said to myself "Trusted third parties are really harshing out my shopping experience, if only there was a way to trade p2p, why, I wouldn't mind paying twice as much for shit I don't want and then having my money stuck in some multisig addy because both seller and ~~trusted third party~~ mediator decided they don't wanna play anymore." 
Don't think I'm unique.

Lol, how did that work out for all the Gox/Cryptsy/BFX victims? The problem isn't the blockchain or CC, it's the fact that there's another human you gotta trust each time you use money (and bitcoins). CC solves this problem of trust with laws and jackboots to enforce them; Bitcoin?

No. With "permissionless and free p2p," you impose the needless, artificial restraints that Rube does by making an alarm clock out of a candle and a half-stick of TNT. 
True, if you need an alarm clock, and all you have is a candle, some fuse, and a half-stick of dynamite, your contraption has a decent chance of serving its purpose. With some perseverance and luck, you might even work out your candle burn rate sufficiently for your gizmo to wake you up (almost) on time; you are, indeed, taking "a proper step in that [perfect dynamite/candle alarm clock] direction."
But what I'm trying to say is your criteria are unique; most people already have sufficiently accurate/loud alarm clocks/don't need one/would rather miss the 8:00 bus than risk waking up dead in a pool of blood. *That's* why your efforts are misdirected.

2. If thing thick, mat and stick thing in shadow box. Don't skimp on glass!
3. For extra beauty and art clout, stop calling thing "that thing." Refer to thing by manufacturer's name, e.g. "Oh, this old thing? That's just my latest de Kooning," or "There is no candy. Only Kialara, a copy of Atlas Shrugged, and this lotion. It rubs the lotion on its skin."
