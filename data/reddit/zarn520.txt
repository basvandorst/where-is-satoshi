I mean, it's not a new concept.  People are treating bitcoin as an investment, so it's being taxed like one.  The good news, you only pay taxes on your gains, so that's less of an issue lately

And all of it into fiat
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:34:01
Me.  I think it's not.  I think that the last bull run was the result of hype, and now that the hype has dropped people are more aware and less willing to risk it.  That and the way bitcoin is largely treated as an asset and not a currency makes it less viable as either.  I think the best thing for bitcoin is if it can manage to stay stable for awhile and provide more utility as an actual currency.  
And I'm aware this will get me downvoted to hell, but that comes with the territory on this sub.  Too many people here want the 10x growth comments out there to try to push new investors so they can get rich quick or make their money back from the last crash.

I'm feeling fine.  I did just get downvoted for poking fun at speculation that bitcoin would take off��
I should have said, to the moon!  Everyone will get a Lambo!

Can someone post current date yearly instead of sticking to august 15th?  
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:10:14
Why not?  I could say $1 or $1,000,000 a bitcoin.  Both are speculative and neither is tied to any type of performance and only based on what people will spend fiat for it.  
I choose to invest a pittance, because I'm not betting heavily on a highly risky asset.  I do believe in the technology, but I think that's applicable regardless of the price, so my estimate is it'll be worth a bagillion dollars per bitcoin. Why?  Because nobody knows and it's just fun to make high priced guesses so people don't think about it as potentially losing fiat in a roller coaster speculative investment:-)

Ahhh.  Then you probably don't want a bull market.  Bitcoin as a currency needs stability.  If that's the case we can hope it stays right where it is for a long time so that it has value as a currency.  No lambos :-(
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:08:32
Yup.  It's more exciting like that.  High risk high reward.  I'd rather the option for the roller coaster that could make me rich. 
 Although, the idea of it not doing that and being an actual currency is tempting......
Nah, gimme the roller coaster to the moon!!!!!
Maybe I'll be in the poor house, maybe if I'm really lucky enough people will buy in and it'll be LAMBO TIME!!!!!
 But I'm with you.  Live a little-buy big,  its high risk, but it's only money.  We could be Lambo buddies!!!!!!

That may be possible as a deflationary currency, but I'd assume a stable  rate of increase would be far below the runs people are expecting.  Maybe 2-3% would be ideal for growth.  And hopefully it would then be treated as less of an asset and more like a currency.  (Such a low rate of increase because at that point we are talking about treating it as a store of value and not an investment).  
Of course looking at it like that, the way crypto is currently treated with taxes (in the US), it would easily take more than 5 years at those rates of deflation to break even when storing value.  And that's if they don't treat it like a foreign currency, and give it the favorable long term asset treatment.  
If the deflationary rate was higher, maybe 6-10%, I could see it being viewed more as an investment than a currency again, which lowers its use as a currency and then we're back to where we are now.  It'll be interesting to see where we land.  I may get that Lambo.   
Or maybe it'll settle in at 4K with a very long slow stable growth of 2% per year.  Then it'll just be about widespread adoption.

I'm putting "blockchain influencer" on my LinkedIn now.  Also, completely agree.  I with the price would drop and stabilize so that it's actually more useful.  (I'd much rather it went to early adoption levels and not the roller coaster). It's less likely to be used when it's an asset to make a quick buck in trading.  The value is only relevant to what it is in FIAT, so let's let the price stabilize and we can actually buy things.  I want the value to barely move year over year so that it's around in 10-20 years.  The value could end up as 100$ per bitcoin for all I care, and it might.  But the real value is when purchases are made and the price barely inches upward as a deflationary currency should

Do you mean a 401k?  Because those are completely different.  Pre tax dollars going to a restricted retirement account that you'll lose the marginal tax rate and penalty on if you withdraw early.  
With bitcoin you lose the capital gains tax on for withdrawing.  
Both are assets, both are taxed. 401k has an additional penalty for early withdrawal.  BUT...it's pretax going in so you accumulate interest on that amount.

Maybe he means that oil is traded in USD.  Which it is, and that actually creates an inverse relationship with the price of oil and the USD.  It's not traded in oil but there's a strong relationship. (His point isn't valid, but the relationship does exist)

Side note, Van Gogh only ever sold one painting in his lifetime.  Maybe there's more to read into that comparison

Couldn't agree more.  It's a new concept, new technology, lacks the regulation of a traditional market.  It's a huge gamble with huge potential rewards or losses.  People who are salty because they lost their entire life gambled with their entire financial life.  They wouldn't be complaining if they made a lot of money.  Only a fool would gamble everything, and only a fool would bet their financial future on a highly speculative asset like bitcoin.  And I don't pity the fool for their own mistakes

That cookie is stale

Everyone that thinks it's going to the moon is just hoping for another hype bubble to happen.  Those that lost fiat bought the hype bubble.  No sympathy.  It's always been a high risk asset with no actual value attached.  Those who don't understand the risk shouldn't be investing.  
Now that said, I want bitcoin to succeed.  I think it's a real product and has a real future as a currency.  That won't happen on a widespread scale until it stops being a volatile asset people are trying to get rich on.  I would like the price to drop and stabilize.  
It's true that it's viable as a deflationary currency.  But then it's value should be far far less than where we are now.  Bitcoins deflation rate should not, cannot, be higher than every other investment.  Holding currency should not be more profitable long term than any other investment.  THAT is why there is massive risk.  THAT is why there was a bubble, and in my opinion, still a bubble.  If it doesn't stabilize and gain widespread usage, it'll continue to drop until it's worthless. 
Just my two cents.  I'm sure it'll gain all the downvotes because I want crypto to succeed and not just make me rich overnight.
