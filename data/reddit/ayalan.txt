Various rumours such as insolvency, and several confirmed incidents like their incompetence ;D make Gox an unpopular choice. People are exiting in any way they can to move their funds, and some people feel that selling their coin for a lower value to get out is still better than being left with nothing. So, coinbase and the other exchanges are carrying on, and Gox is being left behind.

Could be, but there is the possibility that 'kidcratedigger' is also using a compromised wallet. We could assume such, since there are other users who have posted with this same problem on bitcointalk.

In 2008 they were working on an adhoc network. Their about page says:
[...] Back then there was no bitcoin, and the main purpose of this network was to create an uninterruptible text messaging system that works directly between active and present nodes within a radius of 300 meters, via credit card form factor user devices. When Bitcoin was released, the project team realized that it fits perfectly into the project's ideology, and decided to concentrate its efforts on integrating bitcoin into a software-programmable hardware device.

I love that there are panels with speakers talking about digital economy and crypto currency -- but I do wish that they would also include speakers who are focused on academically/critically addressing the pitfalls of these innovations rather than restating all the awesome parts of Bitcoin with a few nods at the problems but not really going deeply into them.
As an aside -- does anyone know if this will be streamed or recorded and later put online? I'd love to watch.
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:28:43
Think of an original name, without bit, coin, crypto, etc in there. Getting a little tired of all those names -- why not develop a brand instead of just putting in related keywords into your site name/domain?

For those who agree to pay taxes this little write up is actually really nice in that it clarifies how we should report gains vs income from bitcoin, in terms that the government agrees with, in our tax filing.

A physical carrier also enables bitcoins to be traded offline; good for places where a solid internet connection is hard to come by or portions of transactions want to remain 'off' the blockchain. Granted we're not quite there yet for the necessity of offline coinage or tokens, but I think it'll be a very important factor in years to come.

I like the design but you'll turn off a Japanese audience using those unit names. Think about if we really started calling these units apples (or appleses) and tigers (tigerses... It's weird to pluralize Japanese words) in English. 
That'll be "50 apples please".
Please don't use foreign words just because you think they sound good, it makes us speakers of that language embarrassed or uncomfortable.

That's just it -- I'm not sure. I'd like to hear someone with critical analysis of bitcoin on an academic level without getting into day-trader investment FUD/circlejerk, and it's been hard to find.

If I will be selling funded coins, of course I do intend to use high quality hologram stickers, not cheap ones that can be tampered with (otherwise they'd be totally useless!). The other option is to sell them unfunded and leaving it up to the buyer to fund it using a tool like the Casascius bitcoin utility. 
As a side note, is there anything in the prototype drawing that indicated an unacceptable type of sticker? I don't want any more people thinking that the hologram stickers could be tampered with.

A designer, ecogex, made an svg package of bitcoin branding parts (which is probably the leading alternative to the B with double vertical lines) and it includes a 'flag' template. 
I'm wondering if it's best to use a simple recognizable image like this rather than a more finely detailed illustration, simply because it'll show up better in article thumbnails and would be easily recognizable as bitcoin rather than artwork? I don't know, what do the rest of you think?
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:22:23
Where do they claim to be the first? I think they are healthy competition.

This would be cruise control to making Japanese speakers think bitcoin is completely retarded. I would be embarrassed to use these terms.

Hi guys,
I've been working on a few ideas for physical bitcoins inspired by nature, and am planning on having these coins made. Before I have them produced, I'd like to check for interest so I can gauge what metals I can afford to use, and if people would be interesting to help fund their production in exchange for free (unfunded) coins.
Thanks, looking forward to hearing your comments and criticisms!

I agree bitcoin needs to invoke creativity and imagination in its users. It's a revolutionary concept and that can already inspire so much. There are places and situations to allow this aspect of bitcoin to shine but I feel this naming scheme is not it.
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:16:31
Totally. I wonder if the 'ideal' infrastructure for those MyCelium smart bitcoin cards would help to enable a solar meshnet like that. Of course, it would require a densely populated area, like you said, but it's a start.

We don't disagree about Apple's marketing prowess.
We don't disagree about bitcoin.
But we disagree that these specific terms are the way to achieve what you're after.
Instead of defending this idea by simply likening it to Apple's branding tactics, why not go back to the drawing board and try something else?

The bill designs are really beautiful, and I'd like to see similar designs used regardless of what the future denominational unit is called. Mills, bits, grains, whatever. Would you consider designing/illustrating an original set without the stock vectors? (The tiger for example is kind of recognizable as stock).
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:35:09
Yeah you have a really good point. I'm making these mostly for myself in that, I find the casascius coins to be a little visually boring and wanted to make something else. But since you generally make several hundreds or thousands of these at a time I figured I'd also sell or give them away if other people found them attractive.
Casascius coins have definitely become the flagship look for a physical representation of bitcoin, there is no denying that and I don't have any problem with it, they are very cool in their own right :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:53:47
I don't need to know how many ventis can fit in a trenta (1.5!), or how many shorts fit into a grande at Starbucks. But with monetary denominations it's necessary to know how many mBTCs, camels, grains, tigers, etc fit into 1 BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:42:36
Ah yeah I see your point. Skimmed over the "until now" bit.
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:38:36
I think that would be pretty hard to pull off with the size of coin I'm planning on creating, but this idea is something I have had in mind for another cold storage related project. Also, coins tend to sit in a case or a pocket all day where they aren't expose to enough light to power an LED. Thanks though, like I said, this is another idea I'm exploring for something else.

Believe me, I wish there were more creative naming ideas like yours. I think what's complicating this, making it harder to really come up with alternatively named units, comes down to:
* the immateriality of Bitcoin. Dimes, nickels, quarters, etc all received their names because they are used to describe a particular physical object. This was a necessary convenience because a $1.00 can be made in so many different ways using different coins, and no one wants to say "0.25 coins only please!". Their names came from their materials, or from the fraction they represent: a dime from disme (0.10 or a tenth), nickel from the material which was originally for 3 cent coins, quarter from obviously 1/4 of a dollar. Apart from using names based on SI like mills, there are few solutions that intuitively and immediately allow a person to recognize the unit we're talking about from name alone, and there are no visual queues for us to work with.
* The already high learning curve for bitcoin as a protocol. A decimal and SI based system is something people are already familiar with and additional terms to learn creates additional barrier for entry.
* The deflationary nature of bitcoin &amp; time -- how often will we need to switch terms? Is it worth having a different name for each decimal place? Bitcoin satisfies just about every aspect except for being 'time tested'. It's still in its infancy and as such it's difficult to predict how rapidly its value will (again, presumably) increase. No one will want to switch the base unit every year. Should we do it every 5 years? 10? 
Granted, there's probably something out there that satisfies what we're after and can overcome the drawbacks of the points above. I hope there are more proposals in the near future so we have a good selection of ideas to choose from. Great design is more than just aesthetics. It's also about usability.
Edit: Here's one! Works on a grains/particles concept. I think it's pretty interesting,
