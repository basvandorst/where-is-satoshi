I appreciate the response. I have a decent amount of capital in Bitcoin and currently use the blockchain.info method with all those security features enabled but I'm starting to get worried it's not enough. 
As far as encrypting the paper wallet, I was thinking use the BIP0038 encryption to encrypt the private keys, save the pdf, then encrypt that pdf using truecrypt. How would you do it?

Yea I was definitely going to keep a hot wallet on blockchain.info with like 0.5-1 BTC but I'm talking more about my long term savings.

Good. I was setting up a dwolla account yesterday but quit when they tried to make me sign on with Facebook

Hope it's a success across the pond and they do one in the US

This is a joke right? There's no way he has over 7,000 BTC. If he does, maybe I need to consider switching to the "taking advantage of dumb people" career line

[No way](

Mine gave me the error message.  What should I do?

Great news but I have been trying daily to verify myself with coin base for instant transfers to no avail for over a week despite knowing the answers. Love coin base besides that but it's getting frustrating
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:54:11
That's the important question
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:29:48
What are you going to use it for?
