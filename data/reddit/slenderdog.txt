Credit will be the undoing of bitcoin.  Secondary instruments and fractional reserve lending will enable the same distortions endemic to conventional currency.  
The discipline imposed by gold only led people (that is, in the first instance, governments) to create other, easier currencies to enable their spending habits.  Should bitcoin impose a similar discipline, creditors will flee in panic, bitcoin banking will be exposed as a perilous enterprise for both banker and client, and any hope of universal acceptance will unravel.  
The only hope for bitcoin is universal acceptance before bitcoin banking faces its first serious crisis, underpinned by sound, uncorrupted regulation (that is, veritable credit rating and insurance).

The author of this article must have little or no business experience.
Day to day business decisions cannot be made by shareholders.  It is a physical impossibility due to the scarcity of a resource known as *time*.   
Even were it possible to submit all decisions, or even "important" decisions (and deciding what is important is a decision in itself), to the shareholders, shareholders would not have sufficient time to acquaint themselves with sufficient detail to make good decisions.  This is particularly true of shareholders who buy and sell shares on an exchange.  
Conventional corporate governance has developed to provide a measure of accountability to public shareholders through the oversight of boards of directors, delegating operations to management, who answer to the board, who in turn answer to the shareholders.  It is entirely possible to corrupt a corporate governance structure, whether the shares are denominated in dollars or in bitcoin.
