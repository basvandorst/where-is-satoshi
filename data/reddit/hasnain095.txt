It’s not a meme. Waqar Zaka is a popular personality/con-man from Pakistan. He’s been trying to sell people over-prices crypto and crypto solutions. The  dim-witted people of my country don’t understand crypto. 
Hence the joke, “Solution installed by Waqar zaka”

I bought my first bitcoins there with a credit card, so no it is not a scam. Bank wires usually take long, around a week, but 14 days is too much. I am sure you'll get your money soon.

Yeah, i'm a newbie. I've been holding BTC for quite some time. Never traded. I'm never trading again.

merged-chain will have the state of both of the coins but that would cause conflict and conflicts can be resolved, either manually or by using an algorithm.
I'm thinking in terms of the forking and merging that is done in coding, e.g. github. I understand that this might be totally nonsense and BS, but my question is only theoretical. 
I think that it cannot be done, as each block in the blockchain is linked by cryptography to the next one. 
Hummm, i think it not possible then.
