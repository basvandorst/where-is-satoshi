Just because it was designed to be limited doesn't make the limited nature of bitcoin any less true.

So you're comparing a descending wedge to a descending triangle. It's not rocket science, it's charting - which may be a bit more complicated than you think it is.

Ahhhhhhh, what's the point of posts like this? If someone listens they're potentially getting fucked over. We should be advocating intelligent investment decisions, not promoting mindless hype.

I still think regardless of what happens, we've still got a big bear on our hands. People's expectations are towards a massive drop, 2-3k range, I don't think the buy volume we need will really kick in till we hit at least mid 3k's. I do think we have the potential again to hit the 9-10k range in the next 5-10 days though, but I think the most likely scenario will be consolidation in the range we're in now followed by another drop off similar to what happened 2 weeks ago.
