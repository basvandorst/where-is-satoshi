The plan is to change the world. 
To do that, I shall build upon and exploit the very foundations of our society. Not maliciously, but by careful investments and donations into organisations that will better the future of mankind; into knowledge, into education and to the sciences. 
People are afraid to take risks, afraid to truly speak out and change things. I am not afraid. I'm simply a child of Earth, not of the system. Our system is fundamentally broken. We see a mass divide of the rich and the poor, the powerful and powerless. 
You cannot be powerful without a powerless person; the majority are powerless to change that.
I want to change that. I want to take power away from the bureaucrats and give it back to the people. I want to better our future as a specie. To explore, to discover, to build and to learn. 
We have the capacity to be so much greater, better. I just think the world needs a little helping hand to evolve into the next stage of humankind.  
This is a revolution.

If you see a charity box on the counter in a shop, is it begging? - No. It's an opportunity.

Take a Leap of Faith. Change the World.
To comply with forum rules, I'm not asking for money. I'm presenting an opportunity. 
I want to change the world, truly. Those foolish enough to even conceive changing the world are usually the ones who do.
I cannot give you a time-frame. Nor can I give you any guarantees. But neither can the day after tomorrow.
