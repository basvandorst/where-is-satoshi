Only the case for crony libtards projecting their broken world view. Bitcoin is about providing the OPTION of individual financial sovereignty as a counterbalance to the status quo. It's a live experiment of applied austrian economics. It won't "kill banks" and it won't "evolve past durr gubrnment". Both those institutions fulfill essential and usefull roles in most civilized countries of this world. 
Those who disagree can join Ver in Liberland where they store explosives in residential areas, ship them in the mail, drive without seatbelts and use bcash micro transactions in the peer-to bitmain to-peer digital electronic cash system to pay for every privately owned sidewalk they walk over.

Doesn't matter what **one** does. It matters what everyone does. And currently what everyone is doing is turning off their nodes and trusting others to run the network for them. 
Without the ability for everyone to run a full node Bitcoin will become the email of crypto currencies. Sure everyone uses it, but it's run by google and hotmail and the barrier to setting up a mailserver you control is insurmountable. 
Increasing the network load before we exhaust virtually **all** other avenues of optimization will be detrimental to Bitcoin. The current wisdom steers us towards creating trustless layers on top of the current blockchain. All of which are not turstless unless we are all able to verify the state of the blockchain via our own full nodes.

No algorithm will ever be asic resistant. One can only increase the barrier to entry like ETH did. Only Nvidia and AMD have the ability to produce competitive asics to mine ETH. 
It's not about finding the perfect algorithm. It's about sending a message that if miners misbehave the network will turn their equipment into space heaters.


That is unfortunate, but the alternative is caving to a 90% miner oligopoly.

Keeping an shitcoin 'alive' for 2 weeks is no challenge. Even Dogecoin is still around. As for keeping a shitcoin *relevant*... well that will be impossible for bcash as the toxic twats working on it made their best effort, to not only make it incompatible with Bitcoin from a consensus standpoint, but also from a development perspective. They tore out large chunks and refactored thousands of lines of **SYNTAX**! Which basically turns merging updates and patches from core into a nightmare for anyone maintaining the bcash repository. In its blind hate for anything "core", bcash has literally pulled a Kim Il-sung and isolated its development entirely. 
They best thing bcash can hope for is eternal stagnation with regards to any development. (Not to much of an issue if you consider that any changes to bcash, aside from blocksize increases, will probably be met with fierce "but ma satoshi's vision!" brigades anyway. After all, that's the entire premise bcash is based on.) Worst case however you'll have incompetent toxic devs like Zander convince the bcash mining oligopoly to force some buggy crap like flextrans onto the network. In that case bcash won't last more than a year or two. 
The sooner bcash starts meddling with consensus relevant parameters the faster it will reveal it's developers incompetence. Hell, even Jeff Garzik had to have core point out to him that his 2x blocksize increase doesn't work. Hell, even UASF (3 lines of code!!!! which many were convinced couldn't be buggy) turned out to be **FUBAR** until Luke jumped in and fixed it.
I'd love to tell Ver that in a field where technical expertise is required you can't perpetually 'fake it until you make it'... but he's to busy selling plebs his get rich quick schemes.

Vaccum is a thermal insulator, we use it in thermos bottles to prevent heat transfer via convection/conduction (Along with a IR reflective surface on the inside to prevent radiation).
Spacecraft such as the ISS require gigantic liquid ammonia cooling systems to keep solar panels within operational temperatures. That is to cope with something along the lines of 1354 W/m^2 of energy that our sun delivers. Antminer S9 consumes 10584 W/m^2 ... The ratio of power consumption, to required radiator surface is 16:1 for your solar panels and 1.6:1 for the miners. 
Needless to say we'll probably need Elon Musk to *improve those ratios by a few orders of magnitude* first before we can start mining for bitcoin in space.

Replay protection is a standard that will be implemented for any **hardfork** core ever releases because it is **good practice**.  


No it doesn't. Altcoins are formed by contentious hardforks without consensus. Which B2X is. Refusing to add replay protection contributes little to make B2X seem like Bitcoin. It just makes it seem like its developers have not the slightest clue of what they are doing.
Fooling SPV users into unknowingly following a hardfork is **not** a desirable feature that justifies btc1's stupidity. It just proves that there is no merit behind the fork. They fear users won't upgrade to it and bet on the apathy of the majority of SPV users.

Bitcoin isn't democracy, Bitcoin isn't capitalism and it isn't socialism. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift and an ideology unto itself. This ideology is rooted in the ideals of the cypherpunk movement. Unlike many ignoramuses have claimed in the past, Bitcoin isn't perfect and it is not resistant to capture.
Patents have no place in Bitcoin. None of the tried and failed concepts of society we have today have a place in Bitcoin. We have to strive to uphold Bitcoins ideology and fix incentives that have misaligned.
The centralization of full nodes and miners as well as the blocking of safe, backwards compatible improvements of the Bitcoin protocol, for capitalist and other reasons, are examples of skewed incentives that need to be **fixed**. 
These fixes might come at a cost. Reduced hashrate, a forked blockchain, etc. but freedom was seldom free.

No because the decrease in hashrate will be insignificant.


No they dont. While some Bitmain asics might contain the hardware for asicboost most customers never had the benefit of using it. Asicboost was hidden from everybody and only accessible to Wu himself.


Wu will most likely not continue using it because the entire community has an insane incentive of disabling this exploit. It will likely be fast-tracked into production. 
Wu is already frantically deleting Tweets and rearranging history because he will have to explain to his investors how he probably just lost their entire margin. Plans for his gigantic mining facility will also have to account for the fact that he will no longer be able to manipulate the markets through asicboost and near monopoly on asic production.

You can run the node exclusively through tor by adding the following parameter to the bitcoin.conf
    onlynet=tor
You can check the status of the different connection types (ipv4, ipv6, onion) by typing 
    getnetworkinfo
into your Bitcoin client's console Help &gt; debug window &gt; console.
According to most guides I have found, the onlynet=tor setting is not recommended. My experience has been that setting my node to **only** accept connections over tor significantly diminishes my node's connectivity. 
Tor does however enable you to accept incoming connections without port forwarding 8333. My connection was DDOSed as I ran one of the first UASF nodes. Tor enables me to signal support for UASF without plastering my IP on all node exploring websites. My node also improves connectivity for Bitcoin users that prefer, or are required to use the onlynet=tor setting.
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:48:16


None that might help you determine anything because we can't tell from the hashrate how many ascis he has in his facilities.
The cruix lies in the obfuscated and hidden functions of the asics that customers didn't understand. You had to know about the asicboost functionality and how to activate it in order to use it. Up until recently people didn't even know it was there. It is therefore highly unlikely anyone but Wu utilized asicboost. It would have been in Wu's interest to not allow anyone else to mine as efficiently as himself.

The new consensus rule will most likely consist of a flag that says after block X reject all blocks that allow for asic boosting.

@_date: 2017-04-06 12:52:03
Nothing is wrong with it. But one miner perpetually building larger and more centralized mining facilities, causing all other miners to drop out of the game because they can not compete with his hidden optimization is not in the interest of the Bitcoin community.
What people are pissed at is that Wu pretended to give a shit about what the community values while all he was doing is fueling the Core/BU conflict to block protocol upgrades that would kill his competitive advantage. 
Remember this tweet? 
Ext. Blocks so far is the only proposal compatible with covert asic boost. It's no surprise he jumped on board the second it was announced through MSM. The fact that it's introduction forcefully circumvented BIP and OSS procedures is just another sign that there was backroom lobbying going on. 
Whether or not you agree with this sentiment doesn't really matter. It is in the financial interest of all miners not named Jihan Wu to remove the PoW exploit. And it is in the interest of the Bitcoin community to not help build a Bitmain [mining monopoly]( Expect the exploit fix to be fast-tracked into production.

I run a full UASF node and I see it as Bitcoin's last chance. Bitcoin as it exists today is far from useful. Privacy, fungibility are seriously lacking and if SW doesn't activate by the end of this signaling period I don't see why it should ever activate. 
It saddens me greatly to see toxic contrarians drive such a wedge into the community. There is a myriad of solutions in the pipe that depend on SW. Bitcoin's future hinges on this one event. Imo failing to activate SW will result in the failure of the entire Bitcoin experiment. There will be no progress. Precedent will have been set. Once a crypto becomes popular differing interests will cause crippling stagnation.
I welcome a fork of the network for the sake of progress. I wouldn't care even if block intervals slowed to 1block per hour. My UASF node will run until midnight November 15th 2017. If SW isn't locked in by then I don't see a reason not to pull a Hearnia and simply not bother anymore. It's not like the infighting will stop. It's hard to see how anything might be achieved past that point.

If SW doesn't receive enough support to activate nothing will and that is perfectly fine because so far all other solutions were only interested in creating new Bitcoin confederacies or benevolent dictators. They ride popular issues such as tx backlong and conf times but offer no technically sound solutions, only political power-grabs.

Increasing resource requirements to do something means less people can do said thing.
That is an **axiomatic truth**. If you don't see it you can not be reasoned with. Now if we somehow manage to both accept this statement we could proceed with a discussion.
Ver's argument is that attracting more people will cause more people to run full nodes. **The burden of proof lies with him (and others parroting the statement) to show that it is true**. Simply assuming that if we increase the user-base by 100x, the absolute number of full nodes will show a correlated increase, is preschool level reasoning. 
The educated participants of the debate see that the demand for block space exceeds what any linear capacity increases could **ever** achieve. Whether we have 1MB, 10MB, or 100MB blocks today. It wouldn't matter one bit. Everything about Bitcoin, market cap, block space, use cases, etc. displays the demand for **exponential growth**. At the same time the tech facilitating the demand is reaching physical limits. Clock speeds will not increase any further because they are limited by the speed of electricity traveling from one end of the die to the other. MOSFETs size can not shrink and further as electromagnetic interference makes them unreliable. You can't simply scale silicon chips due to thermodynamic constraints.
Here's another axiomatic truth: Decentralized networks are inherently less efficient than centralized networks.
Claiming that the trend of tech development in the last 3 decades will facilitate Bitcoins growth for the next 3 decades is comparable to claiming we will reach light speed travel by 2050 because look! Horse -&gt; combustion engine, jet-engine, rocket-engine in 50 years!
Chasing after demand by "simply changing value *x* to value *y* is a simpleton approach. While simpletons elected Trump to be the president of the united states of america, they will be fought tooth and fucking nail by what ever remains of the original Bitcoin community that actually understands what Bitcoin's "Don't trust, verify" mantra means and understands what the **Peer to Peer** aspect of the protocol means for Bitcoin's unique value proposition.

The best way to destroy bitcoin is a P2SH tx where the script simply evaluates to "false" and nothing else. Send bitcoin to the address and publish the script to prove no one will ever be able to redeem the coins because the script will never return "true".

Bitcoin is freedom and using Bitcoin means being free of trusted third parties. Limiting the block size ensures that remains the case. If you are not willing to spend 5USD for an uncensorable, pseudonymous, global and permission-less transaction then it just seems you don't value your freedom much. Either that, or you simply don't need it.
The other day I had to pay a taxi cab and rushed to an ATM. Unfortunately I didn't have an account with the bank I was withdrawing money from and they charged me 5USD for a 30USD withdrawal. That transaction had none of Bitcoins benefits and was a hell of a lot more expensive.

14 Billion USD marketcap. On a premined, centralized scam coin. Ripple is missing part of it's transaction history and the security model is based on trusting 5 master nodes adding the correct tx into a block and not double spending/inflating the supply of XRP. None of which anyone would notice because there is no way to determine what the valid chain is. On top of that only about 33% of the 100billion XRP shitcoins ever made it into circulation. 
12 Billion USD marketcap. Another shitcoin that technically viewed, scales 10x worse than Bitcoin. However, through Buterin, non-existent sharting, PoS and the power of dreams already has achieved infinite scaling, at least with regards to investor stupidity.

To me "Core" refers to the ideological core of Bitcoin. The vision of a **trustless**, distributed and truly **peer to peer** digital form of cash. I value the liberty that fiat cash enables not the coffee payments. I fail to grasp how anyone could see it any different way.

Nope, BCH is the cacophonous crescendo initiated by Hearn and Andresen back in the day when they decided to sidestep the open-source development model.
They overwhelmed rbitcoin with FUD on such a ginormous scale that it triggered the entire "censorship" ordeal. Then they started paying for hundreds of fake XT nodes to appear as though there was support for the movement. After XT had failed and a week after the HKA, Bitmain decided to dredge up the classic turd. Essentially paving the way for the hashrate and corporate interest fueled BU/EC filibuster. 
As we have reached the end of the line and pretty much all options have been exhausted, the last ditch effort is to attempt to hardfork to a new shitcoin  while spamming social media with manipulated futures about how BCH is worth jack shit.

When not posting on rbtc people will expect you to back your claims. It will be though in this case because your claim is rbtc level illiterate and trivially falsifiable. 
An attack on the 30% BIP148 chain with &gt; 30% hashrate could reorg / censor tx in a single block. An attack would be detected and users would just have to adjust their security model to only accept tx that are 2 blocks deep. 
Parallel mining an alternate history will require significantly more than 30% hashrate and **guarantees** that the legacy chain is reorged into BIP148. This would leave the dysfunctional BIP148 blockchain as the **only** existing blockchain. The only result of which would be that the perceived value of Bitcoin would suffer additionally. 
A 30/70 split is a very comfortable situation and at 30% BIP148 would be well on it's way to reorging the legacy chain. 15% is all that is required for UASF to take hold. The only thing the opposition can hope for is that literally no miner decides to mine 148. If a BIP148 blocks are mined past Aug 1st Bitmain might aswell light their server farms on fire. There'd be no stopping or forking anything.

There is no benefit at all in waiting for contrarians to come to their senses. The goal posts of the discussion have been shifted far enough and I am not interested in watching contrarians squirm around speading FUD and stupidity for another 16 months.

What's a "shitload"? every block that you add to 148 is one block less on legacy. Jihan already mines empty blocks so it would be a minor nuisance at the expense of an increased legacy reorg chance.

UASF BIP148 is happening and it will be good for bitcoin as tech improvements can proceed on the SW chain. The rest can keep butting heads with the idiots over on rbtc who don't have the balls to put their money where their stupid mouth is.

I imagine he would be one of those street performers.... yelling at people passing by for having heard a sequence of tunes without putting money in the hat.
No one is entitled to anything. Artists have always had a tough time monetizing the fruits of their labor, but being bitchy whiny cunts asking for institutionalized invasion of privacy, imposing surveillance and control over the consumption of bits and Bytes literally won't get them far. I also just seems so petty and pathetic... much like your parent post's attempt to guilt people into not using adblock.

Activating SW Aug. 1st anything but rushing. As for splitting the network... it's better to get used to that thought earlier rather than later. I don't want to be on the same network as the AXA/Blockstream/Bilderberg/Theymos conspirtards anyway and since they apparently can't shut up about Ether and are not planning to fork to their Jihan EC premined crapcoin anytime soon, it's time to move on without them.
UASF Aug 1. the rest can do what ever they wish.

Unlike many of the plebs over on rbtc, people running BIP148 realize that it doesn't matter what the core devs support and it doesn't matter what Jihad or Ver bitch about all day long.
That's why it's called a **user** activated soft fork. An overwhelming majority of the full nodes runs SW and an overwhelming majority of the businesses are awaiting SW. Come Aug. 1st all these participants will have the option to get what they want. 
The conservative attitude of core devs won't matter, Jihan's asicboost tirade won't matter and Ver's filibuster and clown pit won't matter either.

What makes you think any of them are trustworthy? I assume none of them are. You are throwing dice and hoping one is. If it isn't 100% of the traffic you route through them is compromised.
There is a myriad of *exalted* and *trustworthy* VPN providers out there. Putting trust into one over the other is silly. They are all equally un-/trustworthy. I am trading the relatively insignificant risk of part of my meta data leaking over all of it leaking.

rbtc's favorite two words. It's no surprise they even base their 'mathematical proofs' on "what if".

As a zealous 148 supporter I must knowledge this. If 148 doesn't rapidly gain 13-15% of the hashrate around Aug 1. the effort will have failed. While that would be unfortunate, it would offer a clear indicator of 148's success rate early on.
The Barrycoin effort is attempting to circumvent any and all conventions that define Bitcoin's OS standard protocol upgrades and is DOA. Meanwhile Jihan and Ver are digging their graves deeper by doubling down on the stupid they are spreading. Every forced coup attempt prior to August will further fuel the UASF. Hands are being forced, rbtc is squirming, the crescendo is building and the climax will be magnificent. The last filibuster will die, the clowns will fork or fail(or both fork and fail) and Bitcoin's meritocracy will prevail.

Argumentum ad account age - so convincing. Does it make you feel better to believe my opinions and I will "vanish" once I move on to the next account?

I'd like to live in the world you believe to be living in. There won't be a 2MB HF prior to the activation and thorough observation of SW's impact. 
From a technical perspective the likelihood of a objectively superior proposal to SW to emerge any time soon is basically 0. Even if it did, the conspirtards will just shift their goalposts once more and guarantee there won't be consensus for it.
There will be no reconciliation with illiterate fudsters and deranged corporate interests. If UASF fails the status quo will remain and the only option for change is to move to an altcoin that will inevitably repeat the same process.

Payment channels and LN doesn't work the way you think (or rbtc has told you) it works.

Some people are trolls, some people are circumventing bans but more importantly, others... have simply decided their opsec should include varying/changing pseudonyms. 
I can see how the last one can be hard for some people to grasp in the facebook age of digital stupidity. 
If you don't believe it or don't get it... etc.

If that competing group of miners actually follows through the chain will be split into 3: BIP148, legacy and Bitmaincoin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:29:04
It is impossible to accurately predict the hashrate distribution and it is disingenuous to argue any particular outcome. There **could** be 1 chain, there could be 2 chains and if Bitmain forks there **could** be 3 chains.
I don't care how many chains there will be past Aug 1st because my blockchain will be BIP148. If any chain splits do occur the only relevant issue to me will be how to sell non BIP148 coins.

Am I the only one that switches VPN providers on a 1-3 month basis? I do tend to use some reliable services more often than others, but trusting a single VPN to route all my internet traffic for the next 3 years would make me uncomfortable.
I'm also wondering why a VPN provider needs someone like Ver on their board of advisers...

\&gt; Claims to have MATHEMATICUL proof LN will never be decentralized (spoiler: it's click bait)
\&gt; Lacks the understanding between centralized, decentralized and distributed (despite including a pretty self explanatory image).
\&gt; Dismisses own stupidity and proceeds to "prove" LN will never be.... what was it now? Decentralized or distributed? 
This article is so infuriatingly fucking retarded and the fact that the atrocious napkin math would be considered mathematical proof by anyone here to garner even a single upvote nearly makes me want to off myself. The amount of stupid is suffocating.

You can't imagine how much this was clawing on my insides while I forced myself to read through that article. Logic ocd turned up to 11.

My node runs UASF BIP148 and I am dumping the legacy chain coins come Aug 1st. **No matter the outcome.** 
Let the clowns bitch and whine about Sibil attacks and how you can't measure the economic majority as much as they want.
