Because they outed him. Irresponsible jackasses. Look at what Warren Buffett did when his granddaughter acted as if she was entitled to his money - he disowned her.
Nakamoto should do the exact same thing. They contributed towards the wholesale destruction of his privacy.

I second you.

And you to your horse porn stash, assface.

Your logic is wrong. 
People are trying to help and relocate him only because he's been outed in his alleged capacity as the founder of Bitcoin -- which is not the same as helping 'every person' who was similarly doxed (who are likely not to have such a significant role in a doxing scenario).

No, you idiot, this is not "every person who may or may not be satoshi", this is an old man who has been wrongly outed as being Satoshi by an irresponsible, unethical journalist. And more importantly, an old man who cherishes his privacy and anonymity, but who is deprived of it by the act of the said journalist. We now want to mitigate the damage/injury caused to him mentally/physically, in the interests of helping a fellow human.
If we go by your logic, I hope you get rammed down by a car or get raped or something, then if you ask why we didn't help you, the answer would be, "so every person who may or may not get rammed down by a car/get raped we should put into some hospital?"

Yup. Because if you're going to destroy someone's life, your right to life should be equally destroyed.
Unless you're that silly sort of person who believes that someone who raped your mom should be let off with just a prison sentence because of "human rights" and that you're just *happy* with that.

Bullshit. She should. Let her have a taste of her own medicine.

And I hope his children don't get his money. They outed someone close to them, knowing that he doesn't like to be outed. And more importantly, judging by the way the article is written, his siblings are likely to have no qualms to do whatever's at stake to get his money (which they contributed nothing towards):

I'd prefer that she be doxed. Let her (and hopefully other journalists) learn that they shouldn't blast out others, if they themselves don't want to be put through it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:55:04
And you're an idiot.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:23:40
Very good observation. I need to emphasize the following:




@_date: 2014-03-09 15:57:52
Yup. And you're intentionally avoiding the first part: 'if you're going to destroy someone's life, your right to life should be equally destroyed.'
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:46:20
...Because your views are worthless?
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:56:54
Exactly. You think he wanted it? But that can be justified for him being such a public persona. 
Nakamoto here isn't a public persona. There's no reason to chase him, beyond mere paparazzi journalism.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:21:08


Tell that to Barack Obama. For a man whose position requires him to be public, we still respect his personal privacy.
And yet to a man who does *not* want a public persona, you say we don't need to respect his call for privacy at all.
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:24:15
His family doesn't need protection. He does.

Nope. Her personal information isn't out on the web. Her work-related information is.
