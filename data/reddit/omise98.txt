I used to play a Minecraft server that would let you gamble in game with BTC. It was back in the good ol' days when BTC was sold thousands of coins at a time and the value was different depending on what forum you were buying them from. 
Bring it back and I'll play it again.

I'm a student in the US. Things like this only apply to my savings account, and I get charged a flat fee whenever I initiate a wire transfer.

I would argue that the early crypto spirit doesn't involve moon memes at all. Back in the day none of us ever imagined it would moon, hell we were psyched when it hit $80, member that?

I think fees will be squished to nill if propper POS systems are put in place.

Probably not poor, just not the target audience for this product. I'll happily blow $200 on a nice pair of headphones, but a $100 keyboard or mouse seems crazy to me.

Some folks would like to talk to you about the internet being subsidized by taxes. I know what you're saying is true, but the service and infrastructure they've built does not justify the money handed to them. You probably already know that, but look into it if you don't.

I'd like to buy your passwords for $3. Hmu boys.

These were fees for using my debit card online, they're labeled as international charge and are 3% of each purchase, but they're not actually international purchases. It's weird, but it's interesting to look into if you want.

Can I introduce you to Gdax? Thanks, have a great day. 0 fee backend of Coinbase.

My bank charged me $30 in fees for paying internationally last week. Bitcoin won't have pointless fees like those when it's actually adopted.

Not at this moment, but a few days ago I was paying a $2 tx fee again.

You've become e the very thing you set out to destroy.

I'm not sure I understand you fully, are you saying that because banks won't be able to loan out 10x what they actually own that our lending system will be destroyed?
  
I don't believe that banks need to lend out 10x of what they actually have in cash, that's part of the reason our housing market and education system has become so absurdly expensive. Take a step back, just because our economy is working a certain way doesn't mean it's the best way.
  
If putting an end to our current loan system really spells catastrophe point me in the direction of someone or something that can help me understand that please.

Google owns the .dev domain, they took it private but are now selling .dev domains. It's a flat rate that will gradually decrease as each day passes. Hopefully it was some random that bought the [bitcoin.dev]( domain, lot of damage could be done to the community in the wrong hands.

But then you run into a similar issue, will his funds be held there for being suspicious? Not your keys, not your money.

There are opportunities elsewhere. There are multiple exchange forums where you can buy BTC for PayPal or WU.
