It would depend entirely on how the journalist got the information so I'm purely speculating.

This thread is pure speculation. But one thing that could have happened is that customers started taking more BTC out of gox than they were depositing. Gox went from the only major exchange, to merely the biggest of several. 
Especially since you couldn't cash out BTC for USD on Gox. So if you wanted to sell, you had to take out your BTC and use them elsewhere. 
He could have had 400k bitcoins, but owed customers 1.1M in BTC. Then slowly, over the years, 400k are withdrawn. Leaving gox with  zero coins and 700k in debt. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:08:28
That would really be a libel case, not a privacy case, although you could make an argument it's a false light privacy case. 
In a libel case, Mr. Nakamoto would have the burden of proving the article was defamatory, and IMO that would be hard. Being the creator of Bitcoin isn't a bad thing. 
The burden on who would have to prove the truth of the article is a bit more tricky. For private citizens, usually the burden falls on the defense to prove it is true. However, if the matter is a public concern, the burden falls on the plaintiff to prove it is false. I'm not sure if creation of bitcoin is enough to be a public concern.
However, the big issue, is that to sue for this, Newsweek would get the chance to gain access to any potentially relevant documents, computers, data, etc. that Mr. Nakamoto has. They'd be able to interview him, under oath. 
So if this the real SN, then he'd never, ever sue. Newsweeks lawyers would have a playday with his computers. And they'd be able to ask for encryption keys.

In the US, under Chapter 11 they sure could, depending on the circumstances. As unsecured creditors, you are the bottom of the pile. If there are bondholders or more senior lenders (like banks who loaned Gox money), you might get nothing. 
If Gox's only creditors are the depositors, you'd probably get equity. However, I doubt Gox will reorganize. There is no point, it's a dead exchange.

Buying with Bitpay is silly. You trade cash for bitcoins. Then give bitcoins to bitpay who trades bitcoins for cash and gives the cash to Gyft. 
You are still paying with cash. You are just pointlessly buying and selling bitcoins and introducing risk of price changes, for no benefit. 
Bitpay is great for using bitcoins you already have, but buying coins to use on bitpay doesn't really add to the bit-economy. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:28:34

It really depends on what you mean by failure. 
BTC will never be earth's currency for a billion reasons. But it could stabilize as the default currency of the online black-market and in many ways already has. In that case a fair amount of deflation isn't a huge deal because nobody is conducting investments in it.

Not necessarily deflationary (if it was, you should buy now and hold forever). What you say is true if the demand for BTC stays the same or grows.

@_date: 2013-11-18 23:08:33
1) Even if crypto is disruptive, bitcoin won't be the only game in town once adoption starts in masse. 
2) There is a solid argument bitcoin never gets adopted beyond blackmarkets on the internet. Cash is easier in person, and credit cards offer better protection for buyers for online purchases from legit vendors. 
I think bitcoin will be here to stay, but it's not going to be work 10k a coin or anything like that. At least IMO.  
The current price jump is pure speculation. Don't be surprised when it comes crashing down when people start feeling negative about the price. Maybe the speculation is correct, but it is still speculation.

The bitcoin network is entirely voluntary. People can stop accepting it tomorrow. Especially if a better coin takes over the market share. 


The other difference is that US government forces you by law to use dollars to repay debts and to pay taxes. That is what I mean by orders it to have value. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:10:00
The real question is who will make buying bitcoins easier. Bitpay and coinbase work great for retailers. But their customers still have to go through a long process just to get some coins. 
Bitpay is cheaper than Visa. But the whole process is days longer than charging on a visa card, unless people carry large sums of money in bitcoin. Which right now would be crazy due to volatility.

There won't be an equilibrium point because the size of the bitcoin economy will change, and the money supply will change. When people start loaning bitcoins, that increases money supply.

Bitcoin really isn't either. It's behaving much more like a commodity than a currency. 
Nobody prices their products in BTC. It's priced in local currency and then you can pay with the market rate of BTC to that currency. 
If you got people to stop pegging prices to other currency, it might become a real currency, but people can't do that since prices change wildly.

And I certainly wouldn't do it to save 1-3% on transactions, assuming merchants would even give such a discount. We'd probably see about 1% discounts. Bitpay charges 1%. Visa charges 3%. If merchants split the difference that's about 1%. 
And honestly, you can 1% discounts on Visa from rewards points. 
Upvote for a good debate.

It's pretty obvious the dollar doesn't fluctuate quite drastically. You can compare it with other currencies, other commodities.

The coins are only cheap if it goes back up again. There is nothing that says it would. 
The Bitcoin market is totally unrelated to any real market fundamentals.  It's all just market psychology and feedback loops. The price rises because people think it will rise, which causes the price to rise, etc. etc. But it can also cause the opposite. The prices falls, people sell, causing prices to fall further. 
And unlike stocks or houses, bitcoin has no off market value. Companies make money and own assets, houses can be rented out. Bitcoins can't do anything other than be traded. 
Bitcoin went from 30 to 2 dollars over a long period of time. The same dip could bring it back down to 80 bucks. And this could easily be a worse crash. You might buy a coin at 500 thinking you got a good deal, and 6 months later it's worth 30 bucks.

You can certainly choose to do it, but it's not realistic. 
The price of bitcoin has gone up over 10 times during a period where the number of transactions has double and the amount of coins significantly increased. The price of bitcoin is totally unrelated to any fundamentals. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:06:53
Well, the volatility will destroy a lot of functionality of the currency. Because nobody will accept bitcoins if the value is so volatile. 
Hopefully after a while the price stabilizes enough to remain useful for transactions. But even then, people will just be using bitcoin for the transaction and then selling them again. It'll be like a decentralized paypal. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:42:55
I'd imagine the lowest interest rate would be 0% + risk factor%. Which means we'd see loans at around 1.5-3%. 
A bigger problem would be that even if bitcoins were generally deflationary in M0 terms, over the short term it's M1 might be inflating. And then add in velocity of money and size the economy. 
We don't even get steady deflation, it'll always be volatile. Just look at gold. It's price moves around a lot. 
I don't think bitcoin will ever beat Fiat in terms of price stability.

There is a reason nobody just keeps piles of cash. It's not supposed to function as a longterm store of value. That slow steady line is very useful. You can do a fairly good job at predicting where the dollar will be in the future. 
What will bitcoin be worth tomorrow? 1500 or 500? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:01:46


But that's the problem, acceptance won't grow if it's too volatile. At least if you define acceptance as people using the currency instead of buying and holding, which doesn't increase liquidity at all. 
The inherent problem is that the supply is artificially limited. People know that if bitcoin ever hit critical mass each coin would be worth a ton. So they speculate. But that speculation causes volatility. 
Ideally, people would just use bit coin for their purchases only (and not bitpay, that's basically just buying a coin and selling it on the exchange). The value would correlate with the size of the market of bitcoin, and the price would be fairly stable. 
There will be a coin that solves this problem somehow. Maybe a 100% reserve bank, or even a central bank. Digital currency is the future. But Bitcoin in it's current form isn't. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:12:38
The infinity or 0 thing is a fallacy. Bitcoin could easily just settle down as the default currency for online, blackmarket dealings. That would support some price level, but certainly not 500 dollars a bitcoin. 
Also the supply for crypto currency isn't restrained. I could create bitcoin2.0 tomorrow night, hell people already have. Nothing forces people to only use the first bitcoins. 
But even if true, he's out 50k since he can sell now. 
I agree that you can't measure an investment by the paper value of the past. But you sure as fuck can measure by the paper value right now (assuming it's liquid). 
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:06:22
Most of the acceptance is through bitpay, which shouldn't even count. Its effectively just selling coins on the exchange and sending dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:24:03
The problem with "saving" your wealth in bitcoin is you have no idea what the price will be in 10 years. There is a very real chance it'll be zero. It could also be 10k. That's not storing value, it's speculating with it. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:21:04
The technology behind bitcoin is brilliant. But IMO it's still monopoly money. It's a fiat currency without anyone ordering it to have value.

It introduces other risk. Namely that big banks or the fed introduce competing crypto currency. All bitcoin has going for it is a first mover advantage. Anyone could set up competing currencies.
So even if crypto goes mainstream, there is plenty of reason to think it won't just be bitcoin. You'll probably see bit$, Eurobits, Bityen, etc. etc. Hell you'll probably have JPMorgobits and Citibits too. 
They won't have the decentralized features, but they'll probably be a hell of a lot more stable in price. If bitcoin goes mainstream it'd have to go massive deflation. But that kind of price uncertainly prevents mainstream adoption. 
And that's not even talking about other altcoins which could easily take off just as fast as bitcoin.

Well a currency probably shouldn't increase like that. Ideally it shouldn't ever change. 
Plenty of idiots will say "well why wouldn't you want your currency increasing in value!" 
There are many reason:
You need to have some idea of future valuation for investments and loans. If I wanted to borrow 10 bitcoins from you right now to buy a car, how many bitcoins would your require back over the next 48 months? 
How many bitcoins a month would you sign a lease for a 1 bedroom apartment? Sign for 2 bit/month, and in six months that might be enough to buy the fucking place. 
Bitcoin is so volatile it's not a good measure of value. Which makes it a crappy currency right now. 


And when it starts going up, people will jump in to try to make money off it. Driving the price up quicker than it should, then correcting back down. 
Bitcoin will boom/bust until people stop dreaming that it will take over the world. Just taking over internet transactions with strangers is a huge market, and a huge innovation.

It would benefit you, but not them. If the bidwall was supporting the price, they wouldn't be able to sell. Because the bid wall is their own. They'd be selling to themselves. 
Even if they could successfully hold a bidwall against the entire market, what would that accomplish for them. They still can't sell their other coins. They'd hold paper value at the bidwall price, but they'd be totally illiquid. 
What would likely happen is they'd just letting the masses cash out on their dime before the bidwall totally collapses.

You can't chargeback cash. So I doubt a bitDollar would have a built in chargeback. You'd probably still see systems for chargebacks like ACH, but it wouldn't be officially part of the currency, just like ACH isn't part of the dollar. 


I'd imagine the Central Banks would limit and expand the money supply like they do now. You may have a philosophical problem with it, but for most uses of money, it's fine. The US dollar is much more stable than bitcoin. That's a benefit, not a detriment. 


I don't see any reason why a manipulation is any better for the user than random swings of the market.
And there is good reason to avoid an inherently deflationary currency. It's worse than than the Fed's inherently inflationary currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:43:52
Virtually all theories of economics agree that deflation is bad. 
And credit is the basis of the modern economy. Bitcoin isn't going to be the default currency of anything other than places like Silk Road, where the volatility is worth anonymity. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:33:19


If people hold until it plateaus, the minute they stop hoarding the price will drop like a rock. As long as hoarders are a huge percent of owners of bitcoin the price will never be stable. 


Which causes the velocity of money to grow, causing rapid inflation. 


Bitcoin is a poor storage of value due to volatility. Unlike commodities, it has no use. And unlike fiat, it has no government backing. It's monopoly money really. It's only value is that people think it's worth something. That means volatility. 


It's only value is that people keep thinking that. What happens when they stop? Beanie Babies used to be considered a storage of value.

Of course you can have a bank account of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:18:03
Well as long as your create a term for it, I guess you can just ignore whatever bad information you want, huh?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:56:44
Bitcoin is a fiat currency. Just instead of a government it's an decentralized network. But it's still fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:05:24
Why would you want some currency that nobody is using as currency? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:20:43
Eventually it'll hit zero. Competitor coins will be better. A lot of the "benefits" like being deflationary only benefit people who already have bitcoin. 
When banks create their own altcoins died to deposits, we'll see a huge change. 
Eventually the dollar will be a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:16:50
Congrats dood, you over paid 25 bucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 15:52:54
No. Bitcoins are just the ledger. Someone can, and most likely will, create a cryptocurrency that overtakes bitcoin eventually. 
You could wake up tomorrow and bitcoin could be down 90% because Amazon and NewEgg announced they are choosing to use Litecoin instead of bitcoin. Or more likely, a major bank announces a crypto-bank note that is backed by the bank. That could lock in price parity with the dollar or the euro. 
Bitcoin is experimental. We all use the internet, but we aren't doing it on the BBS system. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:39:25
Nope. Witness is just extra evidence that they indeed did sign it, in case he later turns around and lies about signing it. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:03:19
I think the real problem is getting customers to use it. 
Also, I wonder how BitPay has survived during the long down period of Mt.Gox. IIRC they were using the old pre close exchange rate, but they weren't able to immediately sell it. 
They could have a pretty big loss from that. May have to increase fees.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:38:10
If Bitcoin took off they could rewrite the rules to be more favorable for miners going foward. And they have every reason to do so. Half of all bitcoins forever, have been mined. That gives "old" money a huge advantage, but now "new money" writes the rules. 
I'd do it.

Lol, just like nobody uses the US dollar? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:54:17
And Bank of America's books aren't recognized by the US government as being an actual dollar either. It still increases the money supply. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:15:31

The economics of bitcoin cannot be separated from people choosing to use it. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:09:53


Full faith and credit of the US government. But that doesn't matter, you don't need the FDIC to have fractional reserve banking. It was done for centuries without it. 


For the same reason nobody gives a fuck that Bank of America doesn't actually have your same dollar in a vault. The free market has supported fractional reserve banking for centuries. It's silly to think it won't with bitcoin as the currency. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:50:01
You could create a fractional reserve bank that deals in bitcoin. In fact if bitcoin even went to the moon it would happen. There is nothing magical about that would prevent you from just having bitcoins on a ledger. Many people already do that on coinbase or Mt Gox now. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:22:38
How do you imagine you could do that. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:55:55
Don't be so cocky yet, the market is still in huge flux right now. They might be snickering at you tomorrow calling you a "bag holder."
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:35:55


I see significant risk of the USBitDollar if cryptocurrency takes off. It wouldn't have all the benefits of bitcoin, but it could have many of them. Plus many benefits that traditional fiat currency has, like legal status for debts, taxes, etc. etc. 
It doesn't have to be better than bitcoin, since the US government can just mandate it's use. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:43:07


When you invest your money in something that only has value from an artificially limited supply. Bitcoins value is predicated on the fact that there is only going to be 21 million. 
When people realize the actual amount of cyrptocurrency is unlimited, the value will drop like a rock. 
Cyrptocurrency is the future. But there is no reason to believe the larger economy will choose bitcoin, and only bitcoin, as the currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:21:19
All Bitpay does is take your coin trade it for dolars and then you really buy the laptop in dollars. You could do the exact same thing with corn futures or anything commonly traded. And it'd be a fuckload less risky too. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:00:16
Maybe. Or maybe you are the bagholder. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:48:44


Why would they all bob in the exact same pattern. 








You are basically arguing that volatile assets are really stationary in value and therefore it must be the dollar wildly changing in value. 
Even a tiny bit of analysis on your part would destroy that hypothesis. Gold shot up while houses shot down. Gold shot down when the S&amp;P was relatively flat. If they all moved in unison, you'd have a pretty good argument, but they move virtually unrelated to each other.  At best one can be a steady measure of value. 
The stock market is a function of profits and other things, it's absolutely not a good measure. 
Housing, clearly a bubble popped. I doubt you'd seriously challenge that claim. 
Gold is the only one that anyone could even half way seriously claim was a steady measure of value. 
But even that doesn't hold up to scrutiny. Graph gold against other commodities. It's not stable. Graph it against labor costs, or really anything with intrinsic value. It fluctuates. 
The dollar is the steady value. That doesn't mean it will always be. Most of the stability is because everything is priced in dollars and prices are sticky. Combine that with the Fed manipulating the supply so that the price is stable, and you can see why the price is so stable. 
Those factors might not always be true, people could abandon the dollar for pricing, or the Fed could lose control when all that money they injected finally ends up in the market. 
But right now, it's pretty crazy to claim the dollar is the volatile measure of value.

Deflation is more than just money supply. Since Tuesday the supply of BTC has grown a bit because of mining. Yet we've seen huge inflation.

You don't know bitcoin will gain in value. If you did the market would already price it in. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:01:30
Yea it couldn't be anonymous. But nether are exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:38:44
You don't need to use the same dollar or bitcoin. It would ruin your leverage, but should make some scratch right?
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:53:40
The value of bitcoin as a storage of value is nearly zero. The price is based purely on speculation and it's wild as hell.
If you had to save your kids college fund for 12 months, would you put it on bitcoin. Fuck no. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:42:41
Any savings (1-3%) would be wiped out by volatility and inconvenience. It still takes days to convert dollars to bitcoins and the price wildly fluctuates. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:08:43
The market already is, they are selling.

@_date: 2013-11-16 18:55:48


That's not even close to the worst case. First, you assume demand for bitcoins  will stay steady, but tons of people panic sell during a price crash. A lot of people who are buying bitcoins are buying because they think they'll make a ton of money. When the price craters, they will sell. 
Also the sorry state of the exchanges (at least those who deal in USD) could make it worse. It's hard as hell to move money into exchanges. So those who want to buy because the price is attractive, will have a hard time. 
You could see a VERY sharp crash.
