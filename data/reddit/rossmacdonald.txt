He is pissing around with people and has ass loads of bitcoin. He just wants to tank it for as long as possible. He is probably buying hoards of it weekly like Jack Dorsey.

We keep seeing people around the USA and other countries with print editions in their photos and backdrops for videos. So people must be buying in Canada retail and sending to friends etc.

When you make over $10K in one month on bitcoin and there's cash in hand, you don't worry.

What do you guys think about BCH fork to 32MB? I was thinking today, if we get BTC adopted back to and beyond the volumes in December, we need scaling to be solved. So what do you think will help accomplish that?

Wow. I am so sorry to hear this. I can imagine the gut wrenching feeling you have in your stomach. Hopefully you can shape your mindset to allow some peace of mind. Money can always be made again. But I know that is not much help right now.
My initial thought is that either somebody got access to the private keys in your house or somebody from bitcoinpaperwallet did. The other possibility is that your computer is infected with malware and somebody was able to record your screen during the process and they took a screenshot of your private key. 
We can likely eliminate that someone hacked your private keys. That isn’t possible and they would have gone for a bigger wallet if that was their goal. 
It sounds like we could also eliminate the theft of private keys in your own home, I would guess? 
So now can we question the QR generator on the website or malware from a hacker. 
The older bitcoin gets, the more I see that it will always have some security flaw somewhere that we allow to be exposed by our own choices.

I’m not sure what armoury is. Yes trezor works with Mac. 
I don’t think you can trade BTC for usd on most exchanges. You can trade for stablecoins TUSD (true USD or USDT Tether. 
Typically you can buy and sell bitcoin with a company BTC back into local fiat but not many at coins. Exchanges will have the alt coins but no trading back into fiat. 
Stablecoins are good to use but be careful because USDT made changes to their backed assets which isn’t just USD now. Stablecoins are still an experiment in my opinion. There’s nothing stable about the backed assets yet the coins are relatively stable. Could cause problems in the future but we will see that coming.

There must already be profiling in a database somewhere or multiple databases. Imagine if a database profiling bitcoin wallets and users was stored on a blockchain and enabled governments to pool data. Yikes. 
I don’t think bitcoin users in general are stupid enough to do this with Facebook though. The technical knowledge to make a bitcoin wallet secure would imply some discretion about privacy, especially for wallets over a certain value.
The value of a self generated bitcoin wallet with no public knowledge of the address is huge! But as soon as it links to a deposit, it’s in the mix.

What would happen is that Facebook would create a database of profiles linked to bitcoin addresses.
From there privacy goes down the toilet. So if you want bitcoin to stay relatively private don’t ever connect it to social media.
The FBI already creates profiles on transactions with special software on the bitcoin blockchain. That’s how tracking was confirmed multiple illegal connections from Quadriga CX for example. Third party companies offer this service already to track crypto addresses back to up addresses and users.

Lots to learn about mining before you do it. I have a 6xGTX1060 miner.  It costs $24 per month to run and earns about $50-60 a month. That value will go up. It’s on software that piggybacks onto nicehash, which changes what it’s mining constantly and pays out in BTC. 
Most people don’t know what they are doing with mining, lose money and sell their equipment. It takes time and knowledge. 
But if you have a decent video card and not an onboard video card, download nicehash and try it. Don’t buy any equipment unless you understand it.

Shapeshift is a great platform. Created by Erik Voorhees who is a real pioneer in the blockchain industry.
Watch your trading fees on exodus. If your portfolio grows the fees can be high. There are other options for trading. Just get your crypto on a trezor. It works so well. Get your private keys stored securely and your exodus backup phrase.

Not a bad idea to diversify in crypto, stocks, forex. Watch closely for crypto as the charts for the next few months are looking excellent. Don’t get your crypto stuck in a stablecoin. Balance of October will be good. November will be a down month and December / January could have exponential profits.

No no no. I’m not talking about P2P on an exchange. I’m talking about a broker who sells to a customer. Unless they are buying more than they are selling and at good prices it needs to be balanced. B2C. 
You don’t think that there will be a shortage coming? Limited supply. I personally know the big B2C in my city. In 2018 a customer asked to buy $450K of BTC and they were trying to pool their resources. Normally each of them have $5 Million on hand to sell but it was just one of those days they had sold lots and nobody could fill the request. The buyer walked and couldn’t buy BTC at that time.
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:49:57
Maybe it would be more effective for you to learn how to do this math yourself. Then you can continually run charts and equations as needed. 
Here’s a tip: any price projection that you see with a round number like $10,000 or $50,000. It’s bull crap. A guess. 
Calculate exactly we’re the market will be. Timelines change but it’s all very consistent because everyone uses the same systems for charting and support. Outside of a full economic collapse, bitcoin will always increase in price in general. 
Lots of haters on here that will say “past performance is not an indicator of the future”. Which is true. Bitcoin can go to zero. Bitcoin can go to the moon. A little charting will solidify the high likelihood of an outcome somewhere in between there and you can invest based on your skills in calculating where it’s going.
Be patient.

If BSV is being delisted everywhere, wouldn’t the coins have to be sold to a person? The exchange isn’t buying it. So when it’s delisted, we will see orders of bag holders. It’s great that CW can take his crap coin and piss off, but it’s not great for the people holding the coin. 
I got BSV in the fork and sold right away seeing that is doesn’t hold value. 
BCH is a decent product, but it’s mascot is a jerk, so the value isn’t there. Could be a similar scenario.

Correct. But you have to take risk for reward. I invest in risk all the time. It pays off a lot. If bitcoin drops. Oh well. Onto the next investment. If it pays off. Ok. Onto the next investment.

Then bury your money in a hole in the ground and see where it’s at later. It’s just an option to invest. There are no guarantees in investing. Weigh the risk.

I think the article is designed to drive the price down. From a utility perspective, the comments about buying High and selling low are ridiculous. Don’t give this article any value. It’s basically propaganda. 
The utility of bitcoin will not allow the price to go to $100. And that is with a small small percentage of the world who owns bitcoin. We have survived this many times before. 
The article is smoke and mirrors instead of sharing knowledge and empowerment.

I’d like to think at that point if this is correct, that the value or exchange into fiat would be irrelevant. Holding 5-10 bitcoin would be incredible.

I think if you are going to day trade, you need to be on your game. You can’t be distracted. Can’t be going out and not monitoring what you are doing. Can’t be distracted by family etc. 
If you want to try it, do it on paper and see how you do. If you try it for real, do it one day per week and exit your day trade investments so you can get back to regular life. 
For crypto, learn which days and times of the week are effected by the markets since it trades 24/7/365. For me japan starts trading around 1-2 am and you have to take that into account for example. Expect volatility or exit the trade.

The coins are souvenirs. I have a few. There are different kinds. Very smart of people to sell these. They aren't worth anything and have nothing to do with the value of bitcoin, which is ironic compared to every other coin.

I guess it makes sense for those who have bitcoin to hype it up, so lots buy and value goes up? 
But if people are hesitant, it doesn't seem to matter right now. Fairly consistent climbs in Value. 
If you have bitcoin and you aren't spreading the word, then that would seem counter-productive. Same as guys paid to call around to CEOs and pump stocks.

It’s not Alts. It’s just a few pumps in short time frames. Look at 30 and 15 min intervals. It’s planned pumps. Volume is up. FOMO. Was below 4B yesterday. 
This is where it will dive back down to about $6K or 5K and then we will see the real bull run towards the end of the year. Massive institutional investments, whales and FOMO from the public will drive the bull run August to December.

Wall Street will leverage anything with value. Everything that can be big business either becomes its own stock, mutual fund, bond etc. 
If hockey cards were big enough in value there would be an index for them. This is just checking off credibility for bitcoin as a store of value. 
The people who understand bitcoin will simply buy it, not a promise relating to the value in an index. 
Same applies to stablecoins. Value pegged to value. What the hell is that? Not so stable.

That’s a good point. I think any crypto currency backed by a physical asset that is devaluing makes no sense at all. Even being backed by “assets” in general as Tether has migrated to and Libra plans on doing means that at least some of those assets will fluctuate heavily in value, while the token or coin in theory holds its value. This is a flawed design, especially if the asset is a stock in a company. Real estate probably makes one of the best cases for backing a stable coin as it is relatively immovable, non-liquid and yes those features are both in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:32:52
Nope. The public want to exit the financial system based on the dollar. 
Governments want to exit financial system to avoid their debt. 
It’s just a matter of time. 
Oh yeah. Stable coins are stupid as well. Because they are backed by the US dollar which fluctuates and depreciates so the stable coin wont always be stable.

This thread is broken. I don’t know why people don’t see bitcoin as something similar to any other product in the world. 
If BTC is mined and sold, I can be resold for less or more. Price and value are determined by what people are willing to pay. Scarcity and deflation of it will mean price increase. 
If you don’t value bitcoin. Don’t buy it. If you value it you will have to spend and use it. That’s what it’s for and it’s a glorious way to send money. Eventually we won’t need to evaluate it in FIAT.

More room to grow. It's a younger cryptocurrency. Sure bitcoin can grow exponentually. But if xrp were to grow to $10.00 which is likely in next few years, bitcoin would have to grow to $100,000. Unlikely in my opinion. 
Bitcoin had its boom. I'm hoping xrp will do the same. Lots of ways to look at it.

Keep setting up other crypto accounts. It’s only going to get busier and busier with exchanges. 
Find a bank that likes crypto. The bigger the bank, the harder it is for them to change their risk policies for crypto purchases and their licensing. 
Find local brokers P2P can be good way to get BTC.
