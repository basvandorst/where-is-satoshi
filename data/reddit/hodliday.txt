Just saw a message on the coinbase ios app saying they have a backlog of sent btc that they are clearing up and might take extra time doing that. What BS!?
They need to fucking scale their infrastructure, it’s a billion dollar company for gods sake

F*** coinbase IMO, i wanted to sell my BTC position before this crash, just coincidentally but my txn just went pending for hours, and didn't even get on the n/w. had to open a case and write comments for hours before the txn went through. During this time, btc price went from $18k to ~14k. Went back up temporarily afterwards, but it just sucks balls to have that kinda anxiety.

for sure, this is as healthy as fucking when you're sick. you feel like a stallion afterwards

Still pending...
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:42
In all honesty, I do think it will drop down to 8-9K range before getting back up. And I am totally gonna buy some more when that happens. :)

Fuckin hell, still pending after almost 10 hrs+

why not? CB will do what they think is beneficial for them as a company. 
And regarding BCash being a scam, IDK about that. I don't like the shit show their leadership is putting up, but overall as a currency it's doing ok.
