Ok, thanks I am kinda new to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:22:16
Honestly if you have thousands why haven't you just sold out? Like legit you are set for life.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:22:44
When you are too young to own any bitcoin. :(

I think you could have for seen a correction after a 11 thousand dollar increase..
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:20:38
Good maybe bitcoin will drop hard so I can swoop in and buy all the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:43:25
Ok. So bitcoin isn't really getting rid of the middle man?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:06
lol it's that kind of thinking that led to the dot com crash in 2000
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:30:33
I agree that they aren't exactly covering it in the correct light. They should be covering the headlines with bitcoins price corrected after rising 12000$
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:16:05
I mean if you really wanted to have made a ton of money you should have sold last night when it was at 19000, then bought back in earlier today if you were awake when it bottomed out at 14000.

A correction in economics is considered a 10% dip. So technically it would be considering the price has dropped $2500 USD since its high at low 19000.
edit: Well the market isn't really reevaluating the price so much as there were a couple of scandals or robberies.-something of that sort where a bunch of bitcoins are unaccounted for.

I would name it "that retard from school" you never really know what to expect
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:54:55
Wait... isn't bitcoin anonymous?
