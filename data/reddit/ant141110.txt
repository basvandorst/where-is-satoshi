the miners would be paid in BTC to secure the ledger for private keys of everything else.  No reason for ANY other POW blockchain ever!   
Electricity costs to maintain the network would no longer be called "wasteful" bc IT ALONE takes the place of so many untrustworthy middlemen and institutions who's only profit comes from skimming from assets running through their balance sheets, and are not audit-able. (DTC, cede, ice, custodians, clearing houses, and treasury)     If they are all settled on the BTC blockchain, it would be transparent, cheaper, faster, and more secure!

huge opportunity here to take over the financial world settlement, and do it transparently, cheaply, faster, and more securely. 
sorry to comment so much on my own post.  just want this idea to be shut down for a good reason, or inspire someone to build it. :-) 
We need to take over the FIN world, and destroy the corrupt entrenched entities that are in power now.  V for vendetta !!! 
The people building BTC are much smarter than the ones in power, we need only implementation and education!

Also means no honey pot of assets to hack, bc nobody will know which small BTC address is tied to an asset, and which isn't.  BTC settlement layer only shows value of BTC.

BTW look up Caitlin Long, her videos, and essays.     has caught some of the fraud in our $ system. 
 Fractional reserve securities, and even treasury BONDS that are a 3:1.
