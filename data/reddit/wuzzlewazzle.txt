I'm very familiar with that surreal feeling when it comes to bitcoin. When I first decided to take the leap, I had a very bizarre experience. I was sitting in a restaurant by myself. I'd been looking into bitcoin purely out of curiosity. I thought it was an extremely novel concept, but somehow it didn't occur to me to own it. Then in the restaurant I suddenly thought, "why not get some just for shits." And when I formed that intention in my mind, I had like an out-of-body experience. It was as though something else had made the decision to get bitcoin for me.

Yes, that's true. Politicians do *pressure* the Fed at times, tho. I think Trump also suggested ending the Fed, lol. So we prob shouldn't take too much stock in what he says. 
I'm actually very interested in how the Fed will behave over the next couple of years. They say they're gonna keep hiking rates. It'll be interesting to see how that effects the economy after a decade of very very low rates

when I talk to people who have savings/investments of any kind, I always say they should own a little bit of crypto. Even if it's half a percent or less! but to me, owning no crypto just doesn't make any sense. Even merely from a novelty perspective, why wouldn't you wanna own a completely new form of decentralized money. The idea itself is so damn neat and cool that it's worth having $50 or $100 bucks in it.

in media of all sorts, articles always have a 'cause' for the thing they're writing about. Almost always, the cause is just pure speculation. Nobody would read the articles if they said, for instance, "stock market is up today because it's usually up or down and seldom flat". They have to give a cause, and say, "outlook on trade war is looking better, stocks improve". It's really ridiculous.

I literally remember Trump saying that about printing presses. It was during the campaign. Not hearsay. Maybe other stuff in the book is, idk. But that quote about printing money is significant if the economy collapses on Trump's watch. This may very well happen, since as of right now the US economy is practically the only one doing well in the world, and it's basically reaching the peak of the longest bull market in history. 
Btw, how do you know the book is just hearsay? It came out yesterday. Did you read it already?

yes, and I agree. The people wanted a non-elite so badly that they talked themselves into thinking Trump was just another good old boy like them

While I agree the CIA is evil, for thousands of years any nation or empire with any level of infrastructure has had a network of spies. Intelligence agencies are part of any State. To get rid of them we'd have to get rid of states

Alex Jones is a batshit crazy maniac, and great for a laugh. That said, I'm strongly opposed to what happened to him. We need decentralized platforms for content creators. Companies like YouTube have way too much power

Argentinians, the most obnoxious and arrogant of all the spanish speaking world. God, I almost don't feel bad about what's happening to them

The thing that bothers me most about them is that they almost seem ashamed of being hispanic. They don't even consider themselves hispanic. I live in Miami and we're all one big happy family here. we speak spanish and english interchangeably and mix all our cultures. . .except when it comes to the boludos.

Awesome write up. ty!

well, we don't have to predict when, unless you're actually shorting stocks. I def think the next recession will be way worse than the last one. Now, when that will happen is anyone's guess. The longer it takes to happen the worse it will be.

omg, that looks so dangerous. Why the hell did they have to put the trampoline right next to the tops of those narrow walls! holy shit
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:59:04
It literally looks like it's 2 inches thin, and only covers about 3 1/2 feet of fence. Not to mention the entire cement fence wall on the other side is completely exposed. I mean, holy shit. . .

I've always been confused by this too, until I read that basically it's the present borrowing from the future. Basically, we're seriously screwing over our kids and grandkids

can robin hood be used to cash out bitcoin? Meaning, can I send my personal bitcoin to a robin hood wallet and cash out dollars?

I read about this scam in an awesome book by Taleb called Fooled By Randomness. In the book it was with stocks instead of sports teams. It's a really ingenious scam. then again, most scams tend to be

I would be a lot more skeptical about crypto if people like Charlie and Warren and Dimon treated it with indifference. As in, if they were aware of crypto, but simply didn't care for it. But when I see it get under their skin, then I think there might be something to crypto. To me it just doesn't make sense that they're so hostile towards it, if crypto truly was a nonissue. 
By mentioning Judas, he's making crypto and its community to be some kind of 'traitor' of. . .what exactly? Who are we stabbing in the back, who are we ratting out? 
Crypto is money. That's it. It really is that simple. It's money, folks. Money at amoral. There's no right or wrong in it. And every human should be allowed to use whatever money they want.

this is something that never fails to amaze me. It almost seems like some sort of neurosis. Skepticism towards crypto actually makes sense to me. It's still a very new thing and it's kind of an abstract concept. Hard to wrap one's head around it. But the all out hostility, *that* I just don't get. I've said it before, if they're so hostile towards it, then there's problem something to it.
