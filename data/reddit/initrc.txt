If they controlled the majority of mining power the HF would have already happened. The rest of your argument is pure speculation off this false fact.
However, yes: BU supporters (generally) believe their HF leaves less technical debt in the blockchain when compared to SegWit's SF implementation.

There are some pretty big caveats for bitcoin newcomers to understand.
Users are required to tie up funds into payment channels before their lightning transactions can take place. These funds are only spendable on-chain after at best 1 block, and at worst in 1000 blocks (if the counterparty is uncooperative). Furthermore, the game theory trust model only works if you are constantly monitoring the block chain for transactions.
The only way to achieve a positive onboarding experience is to join a centralized lightning service IMO.

Are you saying *any* change voted for by just the miners is a flawed concept? Does that mean SegWit SF is a flawed concept? Should all protocol updates be done via UASF?
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:23:27
Sure sorry, I thought it was clear.
You claim BU's mantra is that the highest-difficulty chain should always be blindly followed.
Said well, clearly that's not the case because otherwise miners would just make a client that gives them a lot of coin and make that the highest-difficulty chain, and this hasn't happened.
You seem to say something implying that this is why BU will not succeed, because miners don't get to dictate what the network does. But as I understand it, we should also then recognize that SegWit SF is only being voted on by miners, not by users, and so that upgrade mechanism would *also* be unfit by that standard. Since UASF enacts protocol changes via network node consensus (not miners) it seems like you would only be supportive of UASF.

The Unlimited client is not written to accept all blocks so long as PoW passes. Or maybe you're saying it's a slippery-slope until it is implemented in such a way. But that's not how it works right now.


Right, sorry - "vote" is the wrong term here. But my point is that you can't say that BU's problem is hard forking without node consensus while claiming that producing segwit blocks without node consensus (in a SF) is okay. Both mechanisms don't allow any input from nodes before those blocks begin to be produced, they only express consensus in whether the nodes are propagated in the network. And maybe that isn't what you were saying exactly, but that's how I got the impression you'd be anti-SF.

They've been having trouble since the inauguration. Here's a quick [6-month graph](
Edit: still nothing too out of the ordinary, the sky isn't falling yet.
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:25:30
It represents 0.7% of Bitcoin's current coins in circulation, which is actually _huge_ if that were to hit an exchange. That's approximately the volume Bitstamp does in 10-15 days.
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:15:24
We've been using addresses starting with a 3 for a while now, without segwit. Those are [pay-to-script-hash]( addresses, which are used for (among other things) multisig transactions.

Why bother making it op return?
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:41:18
Doubt it. Nobody is going to entrust the cartels to deliver a sum of cash safely to the destination without a strong counterparty overseeing completed delivery. Cartels and gangs have complicated webs of trust and threat to guarantee safe delivery of drugs. José the plumber does not have the same influence.

If the source channel is too new they may want to wait for a few confirmations to avoid a reorg.


Yup, with an unresponsive counterparty it'll take a few days though, longer than traditional chain.


Only a bit less risk, all txns on LN are still non-refundable, although in LN you can't send to a nonexistent recipient, so maybe a bit less risky. Yes, it could likely support instant withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:21:16
Agreed. For reference, this block has 468 transactions. As of this writing, the blockchain tip is block [460580]( which has 2390 transactions. That's a *decrease* of 80%.

With regards to the mainnet, they *did* say that. Do I believe them? Not really. But don't spread lies.

I'm not sure what you mean. You can always encrypt it with gpg using the `--symmetric` option and a strong passphrase.
If you just want a paper wallet with a passphrase-protected private key (_not_ a seed) then  can help you out, they support passphrase-protected private keys.

Probably won't make BTC jump by any more than 10% IMO. This was just a standard hype-based buying frenzy we've seen over and over. Bitcoin's trading volume (in USD) is 11x that of LTC, so it's *much* more insulated.

Because poor people should just get more money, amirite?
[Gallup says the median household income worldwide is about $10,000]( So we (50% of the globe) make about or under $27/day. If the entire household uses Bitcoin and makes _only one_ transaction per day, we may pay (conservatively) $1 in fees. That's 3.7% of our money being paid to some Chinese mining oligarch.
Now let's say we make 5 transactions in a day. That's 18% of our daily income gone.
Bitcoin is fundamentally unusable for the majority of the world if fees stay this high.
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:20:45
That's not necessarily true. They could make a transaction with two inputs, one from the mining payout and one from otherwise obtained Bitcoin, to cover fees. It's just not economical is all.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:30:03
Coinbase, Poloniex, and Kraken all support buying alts directly. Also I don't think buying Bitcoin and dumping immediately for an alt actually increases Bitcoin price significantly.
