Ah I see. 
Edit: no wait. a cash business doesn't need to personally identify their customers. are there special rules for doing business via a machine?

What's the purpose of the phone number verification? 
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:22:09
I thought those were the only things you could buy with it &amp;
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:39:36
Are the tickets actually part of the transaction? Is that even possible? 
If they're just associating bitcoin transactions with a ticket, then I don't see the benefit over anything else.

Couldn't you use the number to generate a magstripe?

Not only that, but nobody has err seen his girlfriend.

I'm in Winnipeg. 
As far as I can tell cavirtex only accepts, payment via online bill payment. If that's what I have to do, I'll do it. But it seems crazy. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:57:32
cool. i'm surprised none else is selling via interact e-mail. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:58:27
Hey, that's not bad. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:01:28
Aren't your units a little fucked? If y = 3 = $1000, then y = 4 = $1333. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:30:30
Ok. This is all starting to make a little more sense. 
So if a large percentage of miners were corrupt, could they not forge transactions? What's stopping all 6 confirms to be from corrupt miners? What if they are not doing the math and just confirming specific transactions? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:06:48
Doesn't work for me.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:26:01
So a pretend space travel company is accepting pretend money? Makes sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:58:23


The exchanges that require ID verification also only seem to accept wire/bill payment transfers. Which would make sense if I wanted to buy hundreds or thousands of dollars worth. 


Yeah, leave the house and get on a plane. 


I'm surprised that more sellers do not accept interact e-mail payments. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:46:29
Works both ways. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:12:20
You're not really describing a problem that's unique to bitcoin. 
What happens if I purchase something with next day shipping and reverse the charge when I receive it? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:55:33
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:21:05
I think I get it... Maybe I should rewatch the video after reading your comments. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:53:02
Now I'm confused again.
My public key is sent along with encrypted data (the transaction?) to prove that I have permission to spend BTC. Correct? Who is actually testing this? Miners? Anyone? The receiver? 


Uh... since all transactions are public, could they not undo **everybody's** transactions? Spending those bitcoins to themselves? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:09:30
I'm sure the Red Cross will promptly invest those in a new hotel. &amp;

Thanks for the reply. 
The bitpay QR code solution seems almost perfect (probably perfect enough). Could you link to some more info about this? 
The digit transposition problem is still a potential issue. Though this solutions moves the responsibility on to the customer  to confirm that they're being charged the right amount. I'd argue that a transposition would still be hard for a customer to identify visually.


This does not seem like a great solution, a private key isn't really private if you're printing it on something. Though, if you're moving small amounts of BTC into separate wallets or automatically creating new wallets on a per transaction basis, I guess it's not *that* bad. 


TMK most western countries other than the US, verify credit card purchases with a PIN stored on the card.

This video did not dumb it down enough for me. I think I have a pretty good understanding of public key encryption and how hashes work but I really do not understand how the block chain verification process works. 
Also, a side question raised by the video, why is it safe to assume that a very significant number (80 or 90%) of computers on the network are *not* malicious? For a system based on trusting no one this seems like a major oversight. 
Edit: typo

my only concern is that they're USD only (right?) and I want to build out other currencies. i suppose i could switch around apis or whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:11:47
It's a good effort, not bashing the video at all. 
For me, it needs to be more technical in some way but also more straightforward. Does that make sense? 
The average person is going to be turned off by all the hash talk. Needs to be much much much simpler for the average person.

OP, Any idea how big a QR code tattoo would have to be for it to high res enough to be scannable?

"You can buy drugs with it anonymously" is an major advertisement.

@_date: 2013-11-28 16:19:02
Possibly, I honestly hadn't looked any anyone else's API. There's looks just as simple.

There were interviews at the time with his neighbours who had never seen her, etc. 
It's probably not important.

Looks like Dvorak was right.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:36:49
Is there a similar way to generate a one-time-use private key for sending transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:37:31
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:20:19
As I said in another comment. This is not a problem that's unique to bitcoin. 
Also, in Canada, we have email money transfers with TMK are irreversible. Seems like a perfect fit for BTC exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:19:51


A little. 
When I perform a transaction and get 6 confirmations, are the physical computers involved in confirming the transaction *mining* computers working on the next block chain? Or are they other random computers on the network (ie. anyone running btc wallet client)?
