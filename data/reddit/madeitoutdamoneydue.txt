Well, considering it’s already very possible to manipulate crypto prices as a retail investor, what makes you think they will not be controlling the float as institutional investors. They will not be strictly trading futures. Now that crypto trading is widely accepted you will see institutions controlling the bitcoin float as well since they will not face legal action; they will not necessarily be limited to futures.

How many times is this question going to be asked? The difference is cash settlement and it’s easier to short it. So probably not good for btc growth (it will slow down)

Considering Wall Street has more money than the bitcoin market cap... easily could manipulate the market as they would want to.

Not sure why you would set a stop loss that close on btc. If you think it could drop sell it.
