I wanted to write "wow. great idea" but stopped myself.  
The thought of seeing both crypto cars crushing the track together gives me goose bumps.

the word "gox" needs to be permanently used as "to screw up beyond previous examples." "A total shit show of incompetence and stupidity."  
  
*It was terrible; he gox the whole presentation.*  
*Someone should have fired her before she gox the whole team.*  
*Your phone is gox.*

It's fun. Don't worry about the cross crypto gang battles though.

For all those with &lt; 1.0 btc on MtGox, be sure to add a "0" before your decimal point on your withdrawal. Omitting the "0" will generate an error of "Provided amount is invalid"

If I had to recommend a US bank (which I'm reluctant to do), I'd recommend Charles Schwab. Unlike other banks, Schwab seems to understand I'm loaning them money, and therefore if anything, they should be paying me... not vice versa. They provide free checking, free checks, free debit card, and ALL atm free reimbursed. That last part was the kicker for me. Bank rocks.

Mass adoptraption of new products and services always encounter this kind of uninformed consumption. Seems to happens in many businesses. Good for expansion but painful to witness.

Does the "reset QS BTC" button on the EclipseMC dashboard just zero out (reset) the confirmed and unconfirmed counter? If so, what happens to the user's unconfirmed BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:14:41
I failed to do the research first. Also duped by MtGox. No verification. No response. No resolution. No way to withdraw. Beware new bitcoin users! It's sketchy at best.
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:14:42
Yes sir. The big wallet shibes support bitcoin 100%. Ying yang.
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:08:43
I'm allowed to talk shit to myself. Every morning I say in the mirror, "you're a dickhead for assigning bitcoin to mtgox." Should have done my research first. Still, I consider the loss an investment in the marketing of bitcoin. Its not going anywhere so even bad news, like Mt Gox, is good news for the long run.

You need to add a 0 before the decimal point amount. Stupid glitch but it's what creating the "Provided amount is invalid" error. Good luck!

Yeah but koolaid works. I think the same about it, but still have a ton of it shelved. The whole circus still cracks me up.
