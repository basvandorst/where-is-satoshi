I would only agree losing % of my BTC if I get 0% fee forever. in other words:
Accounts that BTC were stolen from should have set 0% fee forever. For those that were not affected fee would apply.
what do you think?

Getting less than your bitfinex balance is not a gain, it's a loss. Your solution just makes that loss smaller. Why lose anything when there is maybe a potential for a full recovery?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:48:34
0% fee is one of the options for plankton with low balances (majority I imagine). 
For your situation additional other options could also apply - like gradual refund from future bitfinex fees from other users, maybe company shares?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:04:41
you will gain nothing when they bankrupt.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:33:21

That is not fair and is technically fraud of your customers' balances to cover your liabilities. It looks like: privatize gains, socialize losses.
give us other options like:
1. 0% fee until account balance is fully refunded, then back to normal fees
2. refund others (account balance threshold like ~10BTC) with future fees
3. bitfinex coin?
4. and last resort: company shares

this is why SEC will never approve crypto ETF
@_date: 2018-08-11 23:50:20
ETF will never be accepted because SEC must protect investors or lawsuits will follow in case they lose money. Right now:
1. unregulated exchanges, with no bank accounts, offshore located  - beyond jurisdiction
2. printing tether out of thin air
3. price manipulation by exchanges, miners etc

What risk did early adopters they actually take?
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:56:46
Please back your claim with some facts.
My facts:
1. no proof (audit done by accounting firms)
2. Polish government seized $400mln from bitfinex payment processor - nothing happened according to bitfinex team - nobody lost anything
3. billions worth of tethers in circulation - so.... people wired billions of dollars to a company with no promise to exchange tethers back to USD (and you can't do nothing about it).
Mega billion companies have annual reports, audits, pay severe fines if they can't deliver those reports. That's how real financial world works.

If you think their isn't a psychological effect of $0.618/1mBTC, you're wrong.
Having a conversion factor of $0.00062/1μBTC is a much more reasonable conversion factor. μBTC begins to look like a much more legitimate currency.
Please, those of you with power, contact whoever you may to put this into play.
The only way Bitcoin will see success is through widespread adoption. If people think, "I need to pay $0.618 for one mBitcoin?!", they're not going to want to adopt it! People on the fringe of knowledge about Bitcoin don't even know you can buy it in fractional quantities!
Someone should make a YouTube video interviewing people whether they'd like to buy an μBTC or a mBTC, and see the difference.

Proportions. According to wiki "A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history". Now half of Bitcoins supply is owned by about 1000 individuals. Imagine that 1000 individuals own 87 000 tonnes of gold. How would government react?

Thats what everyone was saying when btc went from $900 to $700.  Cheap coins I mean. Somehow noone was buying those cheap coins. Oh well...
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:24:08
What fortune are you talking about? Early adopters mined their coins or bought them for a fraction of a dollar.
In other words: who is risking more? 
A. early adopter who bought 1000BTC for $1000
B. current adopter who bought 1000BTC for $1000000
It's late adopters who are taking the biggest risk (buying bitcoins worth millions of dollars).
In fact with such a quick btc price rise no billion dollar company is going to invest in BTC, because some early adopter could crash Bitcoin price by just one mouseclick and wipe the companys investment fund.
"The risk that early adopters are taking is growing along with the price of BTC."
I disagree.
Those who bought 1000 BTC for $1000 are risking only $1000 of initial investment even if Bitcoin price would be $10 000/BTC
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:02:43
Ban Bitstamp as they also suspended Bitcoin withdrawals, right? MtGox has got problems, they will fix it, no need to ban anything.

Bitcoin is an experiment. It is meant for determining what features currency of the future needs. Its design is sound enough that so far it withstood attacks on network &amp; crypto algorithms behind it. That said there will arise problems, which future currency will address.
Some of actual problems:
1. Wallet security - lots of coins is being lost.
2. Early adopters - it is not good if few people own 1/3 of currency (What would happen if 100 people owned 1/3 of world gold or oil reserves or simply land?). Maybe inflationary crypto currency will arise, who knows?
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:18:47

On the other hand, people more often lose private keys than money in banks due to government seizure etc. Safety of private keys needs to be addressed for an average Joe to hold their savings in Bitcoin.

1. Bitcoin can be made deflationary by tagging coins mined before. Merchants could value 100 coins mined in 2010 = 0.9 * 100 coins mined in 2013.
2. There won't be another moon until there is big money coming - be it wall st or other investors.
3. Right now merchants are treating Bitcoin as medium to transfer USD and converting bitcons back to fiats.
BTC may fail as a currency but will survive as a protocol. Maybe some banks will adopt it as money transfering medium?

This whole debate is...
Bitcoin should be a network that gives some incentive to its users, not miners. If protocol needs to be developed /changed in order to be more usable - make that happen. Currently Bitcoin (ecosystem and protocol) is a hostage to miners.
Fairy tales that we need miners and miners need us can be flushed down the toilet. There will always be miners. Users need a network that is working. If it is not working - change the protocol. Small blocks (and therefore big fees) are only in the interest of specialized mining farms.

This is not how Satoshi envisioned it and basically this is not how p2p money should work. Rise of ASICS and consequently hashrate basically excluded ordinary users from securing the network.
I (and thousands of users) don't run full node and secure Bitcoin network ina p2p way because it is not profitable. As mentioned, this happened because of ASICS.

@_date: 2017-04-10 00:14:42


No its not. Code / protocol is. If 99% of Bitcoin users agrees on downloading and using changed protocol version (for example SHA256 changed to SHA512) then miners will mine only for themselves.

First of all: Bitfinex does not have fiat accounts. It's cash deposits are _likely_ handled by [Cryptocapital]( 
Is CryptoCapital somehow connected with Crypto Sp. z.o.o in Poland? We don't know, 
Linked article mentions "drug cartel money" and seized amount is HUGE (ie largest polish exchange volume is about $10mln)

As I understand he only needs to NOT signal segwit in 35 out of 1881 blocks in every activation periods. With the hashrate he owns there won't be segwit.

github didn't even exist back then. Read up on MS03-026 propagation.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:56:39
They will not, because they cannot automate it like when Bitcoin network is used.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:11:57


Correct, but since hashing power is largely centralized this could last longer than 14 days, a time when unconfirmed tx is discarded from mempool.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:38:09
Government regulations, bans, censorship will destroy Bitcoin's value sooner.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:04:14


Please provide a link to the news about the attack on such a global scale as this one.


You do realize that ransomware will get better at automating things?
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:02:21
exactly my point of view
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:49:53


-wuftpd 2.6.0
-MS03-026 - totaly with a great potential for massive encryption


I did read it.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:04:33
Correct. Now miners have 2.5 days to upgrade software.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:11:02
In some countries owning money coming from criminal activity may get you in jail. Ransomware authors will eventually spend those bitcoin and someone may unknowingly use them, get tracked and have charges put against him.
Look this is just my attempt to disincentivize use of Bitcoin network for ransomware.
I didn't mention forking so no idea where you get that from.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:41:24
Government will do to Bitcoin what it did to Internet. Massive survaillance, hidden backdoors in CPU, etc.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:08:45


In this case yes it does. Layer-2 will obviously depend on specifics of layer-1. This will hinder development of new features on layer-1 as they will have to be compatible with layer-2. There may arise a conflict of interest between companies invested in layer-2 solutions and protocol change of layer-1.This is exactly the same situation that we are experiencing right now with asicboost vs segwit. 
When protocol is decentralized any influence on development or blocking of new features will not happen.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:45:51
I partially disagree. 
Future ransomware writers knowing that their Bitcoins may become unspendable won't use Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:23:53
You do realize that they will fork it/rewind transactions so that investors don't lose money?
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:55:49


Why would they? Delegalization of exchanges in China will result in price plummet. Instability of prices will result in less and less businesses using this method of payment. Technology will eventually become niche. How about this scenario?
As I said before, this is just my attempt to be one step ahead of government regulation / intervention without changing protocol rules or anything.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:39:45


Government would care. Simple way to cryptocurrency regulations. (Like exchanges already have to obey AML/KYC)
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:00:54


sigh.. I didn't mention protocol changes either.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:09:46
Unconfirmed transaction would live in mempool and then be simply discarded (14 day timeout as I remember correctly). No protocol change is required, just mining centralization.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:07:50
That's a risk, but given recent bad news...
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:26:28


so this is about ideology


Yes, I have even implemented it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:37:14
 &gt;There weren't many easy free exploits on the market
wat? there were always plenty of 0days. Ransomware is relatively a [new]( thing, particularly due to anonymous payments methods like Bitcoin.
Dont be silly, Symantec analysis is soo outdated. Not a single mention of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:00:24
