When was the exact moment you got so jaded with bitcoin that you no longer believe in it as useful?
@_date: 2019-07-12 23:00:04
Again, you are saying nothing and backing up nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:07:09
So you’re salty you missed the 2017 ath? Got it.
Why even surf the sub man. No one needs you.

It would be a forum if you contributed reason behind your statements, but alas, you do not.

Most people diversify and lose money. The trick is to just buy bitcoin and lose money.

Fiat is currency. Bitcoin is money.

Care to explain why it is not the case anymore?
And yes, anything can be traded as money if it has value to people. It’s called trading my dude.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:14:24
Atulya Sarin, Professor of finance and Santa Clara University, a ‘Valuation Expert’....
Again with the Tulips and Beanie Baby comparisons. To him crypto is ‘worthless numbers’ and the only real reason gold has any value is, and I quote “probably due to some historical accident”
What a tool.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:38:40
Bitcoin is better than currency, Bitcoin is MONEY. Currency does not equal money.
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:02:32
I think he’s saying to just remove the circle ‘coin’ from the background of the btc image.
@_date: 2019-05-07 07:09:16
Bad currency drives out good currency. Gold/Bitcoin is money, not currency. It can be used as currency but it is not ONLY currency. I also do not believe that is a true statement to explain why gov de-coupled the currency from money, I think that is a much wilder and speculative conversation that is prone to conspiracy. 
And speaking of conversation, I do not think we are arguing my dude, I think we are both raising  points in our dialogue.
Edit: so we get somewhere in the convo my dude, if you are ultimately right with the statement “bad money drives out good money” I do not believe Bitcoin can be driven out. Bitcoin by nature is the most ‘sound’ money ever conceived, that is the whole point. It takes measurable ‘work’ to create and is in finite supply. Its nature that it does not require a third party guarantees it cannot be co-opted. I believe as a money (store of value) it does not fall into the traditional currency narrative in economics that we have known to date.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:07:26
Why even post
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:38:59
You def got a 16 character code when you signed up for this sort of thing. You either neglected it or there is something here you are not telling us.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:59:25
They basically agree with you then harps on the semantics needlessly and brought up a whole other conversation. They got the point but didn’t want to agree with you lol.
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:04:48
Your not wrong but you are deciding to nit-pik this language instead of focusing on the OP’s message. If you are passive aggressively saying that you do not agree with op and will not be withdrawing with those who still have coins on third party sites, then say so and state why to move the discussion forward. Even though I do not think your comment is moving the discussion, I will still upvote it for the message you are trying to say.

“...High-risk investment like Bitcoin..”
Bitcoin is not an investment, it is money

I love that it has “cash” in grey under the ‘Bitcoin’

Well done, you have successfully contributed to your intellectual ability to max potential
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:41:43
Just a feature. Same thing with fiat when it was tied to gold.
USD was money until it became un-tethered from gold and became fiat currency. 
 
Also, anything is an investment if someone thinks it is under-valued.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:07:52
Welcome and don’t mind the cynics.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:55:26

Shut up cynical voice, you are only supposed to come out when I am trying to sleep.

I unfortunately have no liquid cash after a very smart time-share piece I just went in on. Stupid sucker tried to sell me one and I took him for three.

Oh yeah good point, I forgot Bitcoin will never move up in price and relativity doesn’t exist, thank you for your enlightened comment.
