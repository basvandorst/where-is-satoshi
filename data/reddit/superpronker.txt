Suppose I am some terrorist organization wanting to cause maximal damage to financial markets at minimal cost. Suppose I buy up a ton of server farms and include nothing in the block. Will that mean I can know in advance the next coming block to be hashed and start working on it already now? If it gives me an edge, I could gain dominance. 
Let me elaborate: each 10min, a new block of transactions is added. Based on this, miners add numbers to the end and hash it. If I control who goes into the block, I should be able to forecast what the next block will be and get a head start at hashing (mining). 
Even if this does not work, a hostile takeover and freeze could be made secretive, I could have lots of user names for my different server farms but be solving the problem behind the scenes. 
What is the gain? Well right now there’s arguably a bubble. If nobody can transact, that might lead to panic and cause the market to collapse. If enough people have been lured to the market by the recent year’s growth, this will then cause bankruptcies and have potential for contagion in the financial system. 
Sure, my investment in the server farms would be lost. But at the current market value of bitcoins, the damage could be far greater.

I see. But it just seems to me that the spirit of bitcoin would thrive more without miners getting together in pools. For example, an individual miner would never mine an empty block. But pools do it all the time. It is like firms getting together in a cartel. It can grant them power to do bad stuff.

That’s a good point. Although flight attacks have been rendered largely in feasible.

How is this decided - is there a vote among registered miners? How to ensure that there aren’t fake accounts or the same person controlling many accounts?
