You may be right, but you might be wrong. You can hope for full adoption of bitcoin all you want but at best its very risky to rely on bitcoin to solve all your financial needs.

The way I see it is bitcoin is not a currency for the simple fact that the worst thing you could have ever done with bitcoin since it existed is sell it/use it to buy something. I don't hold onto my dollars because I expect them to be worth more in the future, exactly the opposite, I spend or invest them because I know they will go down in value in the future.

Exactly, if its not a currency what is its value?

I didn't mean literally how much does it cost, I meant value in the sense of what does it provide. If we agree its not a currency, than its essentially a stock backed by literally nothing. You may say the USD is also backed by nothing and I agree but the USD is a currency not a stock. It would be like creating a new company that produces nothing has no capital and start selling stock, if that stock rose 1000% you surely would say its a bubble, yet its monetary value would still be whatever people give you for it.

There wouldn't be a top if people always bought at one and there wouldn't be a bottom if no one sold
