This is actually an amazing idea form of advertising.  Would you pay to have the logo of your company advertised on your competitor's building via projection.  You aren't damaging the building, you aren't vandalizing,  you aren't trespassing...

I think its hilarious how companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, and other mega national conglomerates set their headquarter offices in little countries like Cayman islands, thus avoids paying billions in taxes back to the government.... yet the government is concerned about the $400 you put towards bitcoin.

Wasn't it drivers license and a bill with your home address on it?
Then, to transfer money to them it was from your bank account to theirs.  If those things are tied together, they have access to perhaps enough information to call your bank, pretend to be you (as the bank will ask questions pertaining to the information they have... address...date of birth) and dumb people at the bank will accept it.
I'm trying to contact my bank to figure out how to add additional security to my account... or I close it and go to another bank.  Something like a passphrase at least.

Hate to break it, but the population amount AND relative spending $ was very different back when Airlines and Automobiles became popular (for example).
The thought of travelling long distances wasn't considered necessary for business OR pleasure.  
Electrical grids for electricity, telephone, credit cards, and other electronics took awhile to establish.
And electronic prices have drastically dropped in price over the years, not to mention size (unless you buy an Apple product... then get ready for big $$$ spending).
The best analysis are products created in the last 10 years... counter products that have been created to replace already established ones (online university enrollments for example) or work alongside existing ones (working from home/remote  year over year).
If you want to compare today's technology with other technology's, compare them to other technology's of today, not ones that were created decades ago.

I think you mis-interpreted it all.  You don't see meme's about the DOW or NASDAQ going up or down a few points.  People also may post graphs and calculations of their predicted growth only to see something completely different happen.
The concept of bitcoin and expectation of its performance are very different.  Concept of it becoming a valuable asset OVER TIME is a general agreement.  BUT it's performance is expected to go up to that million dollar mark immediately... which of course won't happen for quite some time.  
I agree with OP, all the graphs and charts and "by this time next year it should be $50k+" is all noise akin to hopes and dreams.
I can see more distribution of bitcoin in the poorer countries, those that are going through turmoil or protests... the richer countries will be slower in adopting because 'hey my cash works fine for me' mentality.

I gave up waiting. Wanted to convert to BTC sooner rather than later before BTC value increases and BCC decreases.
Ended up creating an account on BTC.com with a BBC wallet, transferred everything over.  Then used changelly.com to exchange the BCC back to BTC and deposit back into the blockchain.info account.
I must say, this is the best dividend ever :)

The bubble is related to the cost of houses in general. People are willing to pay much more for house than it is worth... Which increases avg prices drastically. Avg house in Toronto is $1mil. This is because the city is booming population wise (both children of baby boomers now wanting to own, and immigrants coming in... Not to mention the international investors buying property for simply investing). 
Demand is high, supply is low, hence overpaying for housing. 
This bubble won't burst. A $1mil house will not overnight become a $650k house. This bubble will level out and maybe dip slightly as people stop buying houses or more houses come up for sale all of a sudden. 
This does impact mortgage companies as now people are borrowing much much more. But the Canadian mortgage system is not like the states, it has more/different policies that won't cause people to lose their homes. 
Interest rate increasing a percent, this might cause people to default on their payments...

What is bad for currency?
It not being in existence is bad.  Not being talked about... improved upon or even speculated.  That is bad.
Bitcoin is still around since it's birth, and yes it goes up and down, just like the other things that you invest in.
But it's still here.  Email, the concept, went through the same thing until it was generally accepted how many years after the fact?
Heck, the concept of 'typing on a screen' was initially thought dumb until now every phone (almost) has a virtual keyboard.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:13:03
Agreed. I'm not content with the fact that my retirement investments are based on stocks/funds/anything that is EASILY impacted by emotions, bank decisions, government decisions, etc... AND when things go back to normal, it is the very banks that are helped and not the actual customers that invested with them.

Millennials are the ones giving cable companies a run for their money.  Millennials like specific things, and are vocal about what they don't like, especially what they don't trust.  There was a huge sub-reddit on how EA, a video game developer, made some choices that most didn't agree with and therefore created a big backlash.
Broke.. perhaps.  There is a reason and they'll work against those that created a culture of them being broke.  And because they're broke, they have no money to invest, so who will give banks the money they need to survive?  Banks are winning at the moment, but they'll be in trouble soon same with cable companies when easier methods for money transactions appear.  Blockchain will help with this, and cryptocurrencies will eventually become more mainstream like how email did several years ago.

His own source.  This is not only misleading, it kinda show's how some people need something better to focus on.

no need to be insulting... 
simple math would show you that those born in 1982 would be 36 this year.  not 40.
Those born in the late 80's are brushing 30 now.
That being said, when they use the term 'adults', it implies that they are at an age where they can start looking at RRSPs, investments, paying off the mortgage they have, looking for the second car... basically having established themselves to a point where they can finance these additional things.  Today, however, this is not the case as millenials are behind and WILL be behind in this for some time.

The concept of digital didn't exist back then.
Just like the concept of a steam propulsion didn't exist for steam engines.  
Or the concept of capturing and distributing an electrical current via the light bulb.
Or the concept of combustion in a car engine.
These things you see are physical, but the methods that are causing them to do their things you can't really touch.
Radio and tv signals, internet, these 'inventions' are only visible on the end product that you use to interact with.
Bitcoin, blockchain... you'll interact with them on your pc/phone/bank.
Because putting a picture of a gold coin with the bitcoin symbol on it doesn't mean THAT is what all of bitcoin is.

Not yet, nor in the for-see-able future. This thing is still a baby.  And when the value goes down the nay-sayers laugh and when the value goes up the believers laugh.  In the end they both won't be alive to really enjoy and experience what the revolution of digital currency will bring.

The average Joe, back when the light bulb came out, didn't have one/any.  Safe to say back then in the light bulb's infancy, the average Joe didn't know how a light bulb worked either.
