I am giving it a try. [V1](
EDIT: [V2](
Font size changes for more readability. Pro and con use thumbs icon now, maybe not as confusing as dots. Icon using reddit color for easier instant understanding for redditors.

The pro and con section?
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:05:13
The Brown colored entries are cons, I think. Unless they are not really cons. I am not sure.

Thanks for the suggestions. I'll change the scalability titles. They do seem small now.
Is there a reason that cash should not be there? Do most not care for P2P transactions? Like Craigslist, flea market kind of stuff?
I am going to rethink about the pro and con layout to make it more clear. I do run into spacing issue.

Common now! 35GB is like 2 good blu ray rips.

Should also point out that some payment processors do indeed charge $0 fee, such as bitpay.

It is only ridiculous because it took BFL 14 months between payment and refund.

It's like landmine but in the form of a line. I think it's one type of shaped charge.

But what if the banks are the ones manipulated the ~~well designed~~ poorly designed system into place?

Dividing the smallest denomination mostly mean the denomination has too high of a value to be used for small transactions, or that the demand is higher than the current amount can support. The action of dividing itself does not mean much. But having the need means the value is increased which benefits the people who already own some of the currency.

Thank you. I do use screen lock, but I do occasionally hand my phone to friends and families to show kids photos and stuff. I do not want anyone to see the balance if they wander into the app.

For Android version, can you make PIN to be required to open the wallet instead of just send/export?
@_date: 2015-02-14 03:43:08
That's good. That will work for now. I didn't think of that. Thanks.

Thank you.

I think he mean PIN before the app will open so you can't see any info at all without PIN.
