Hmmm.  When I followed the procedures for verification and authentication of a credit card purchase in my business, I did not shoulder the financial burden for fraud.  I only had to worry about chargebacks.

This whole govt induced probe makes no sense.  Why would they freeze  and/or seize only the cold storage?  If they could seize the cold storage, they would have been able to seize everything.  
This has been going on for months ... well past any amount of time needed to get an order to seize assets after the assets have been frozen. If they have seized assets, there is no point to a gag order anymore.

Yet no amount of "learning" will overcome the very practical concerns the OP has.  Unless other protocols are bolted onto Bitcoin (protocols which likely will involve fees) Bitcoin as a practical form of currency is limited.

You make the OP's point.  Without escrow, Bitcoin fails for the average consumer.

I was never chargedback for fraud.  I only received chargebacks when a customer and I couldn't agree on a resolution to our differences...and it was infrequent.  For identity theft, stolen cards, etc. I never shouldered any financial burden.  That was much more common.

addresses connected to Silk Road would not likely be Mt. Gox's cold storage wallets

Why do you say that?  I bought an SSD drive, checked out, went to Coinbase and bought the $100 worth of bitcoin, pasted in the TigerDirect address from my checkout page, and I was done.  Total transaction time about 4 minutes.  The price of Bitcoin is more or less irrelevant if you buy it at the same time you checkout.  And the $20 off more than made up for the small transactional cost at Coinbase.

and then a Japanese court granting him bankruptcy?  due to the loss of his "terrorism associated" coins?  Not likely.

Not to tc but I think I just realized a new use for all those old digital frames I retrieved from relatives and have laying around.

which is unfortunate since I have several hundred trillion Zimbabwean dollars

I have had no problems using USAA to ACH funds to and from Coinbase for several months.
