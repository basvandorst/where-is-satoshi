Uh, no. What's shameful and humiliating is that we Americans have allowed our once free country to become so restrictive with hardly a whimper. American banks and American government are two sides of the same coin. The irony is that all the policies and laws and wars and propaganda that have allowed a greedy and entitled few accumulate the vast majority of wealth at everyone else's expense are exactly the things that are dividing and destroying the nation whose institutions, infrastructure and workers created that wealth to begin with. 
Time to wake the f*&amp;k up and realize that America is no longer the land of the free. We're at the mercy of corporations and their government puppets, and no matter what cable news network you think is the devil, your vote no longer changes anything.

I think mining a bitcoin costs substantially less than $500 for a big operation that makes their own hardware or buys ASICs in bulk. KnC is selling bare 28nm ASICs for $.18/GH/s vs. $1.53/GH/s for a complete miner at retail (November Spondoolies SP35). I expect big mining operations pay even less than the KnC price for bare chips. While custom PCBs and BeagleBones aren't cheap, you can rest assured that big mining operations are paying a small fraction of retail prices for their hashpower. $400 coins could very well be profitable for some miners.

That was the point. A government isn't necessary for businesses to have advantages, but even starting on a hypothetical level playing field, unregulated markets will create monopolies and concentrate wealth until demand collapses and/or the masses rebel. 
Unfortunately I won't have time for awhile to check out the videos, but I'll make it a point to do so along with some reading. Depending on the definition of a "mature and technologically developed society," our views may not differ too dramatically.

That would be true if they'd refund the bitcoins paid, but instead they will only wire $10k + to my bank account. That would have been fine before the IRS decided bitcoins are property and not currency. If I get a refund, I take a 25% hit for 2013 taxes. And since it's a wire of over $10k, it's a guarantee the IRS will be asking about it. Add to that the fact that neither 3TH now, nor 4.5TH or whatever when Neptunes actually ship, will ever return the 12BTC I need to break even. Of course, if KnC hadn't added so much goddamn hashpower to the network, the 3TH now might show a decent return.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:39:24
If you've purchased a Neptune, you can switch to the equivalent hosted hashing at no charge. Or, you can just take your Neptune and mine yourself. Also, KnC has no ASICs for sale at the moment, and they'll never again sell the 28nm ASICs that they are building their data center with. The 20nm ACIC hasn't been taped out yet, so the data center project isn't tying up manufacturing capacity that could otherwise be used to fill existing orders.

Bitcoin negates one of the big advantages that huge corporations have over smaller businesses. They're able to negotiate very low fees with payment processors and credit card companies because of their volume. I think the giants like Amazon and Walmart would prefer Bitcoin never go mainstream and will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into accepting it themselves once (if?) they start losing market share because smaller competitors are able to pass savings to consumers.

Big mining operations are not paying $3/GH/s, or even $.50/GH/s. Bare chips are available to the public for $.20/GH/s, so it stands to reason the cost to a company that designed the chip is much lower than even that. PCBs and power supplies, etc are an additional cost, but for many large mining operations, $380 coins will more than pay the bills.

It's true. I once disabled my antivirus while troubleshooting some issue and forgot to re-enable it. For a year. When I finally noticed, I re-enabled and updated the sigs. Ran a scan, and was clean, so I disabled it again because I had better things to do with the resources. I wouldn't recommend the practice, however. It's best not to go torrenting, for instance, without protection.
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:00:35
This is a great insight. I think the added selling pressure is most directly caused by the transition to large mining corporations who have very big bills to pay, and the ASIC revolution facilitated the dominance of of large companies. A new ASIC requires a much larger investment than most individuals can afford, and naturally, a company large enough to foot the bill will ultimately prefer to mine enough coins to pay off development costs. Hobbyists may still be holding the coins they mine, but for better or worse, they now mine a very very small proportions of coins.

This is a good point, and it's why I think Coinbase should do all it can to encourage merchants to give customers a 1.5% or better discount for using Bitcoin. Seems fair in exchange for saving 3% or more by avoiding credit card transaction fees. Considering how early in the game we are, I imagine most merchants that accept Bitcoin or are planning to believe in its potential and want to see it succeed, it might actually be easy to convince merchants to give customers who pay with Bitcoin a break. Coinbase might also consider a slightly lower fee for Buy Back because it makes spending Bitcoin a little easier, and the easier it is to spend, the more people will spend it. Everyone wins.

You either misread or misunderstood the network protection statement. For one thing, it ends at the end of this month. The 6 or 7 people who've hijacked the KnC thread in bitcointalk and do nothing but spew conjecture and FUD notwithstanding, a lot of people who've given up on that cesspool of a thread actually are very happy with KnC, and see no reason to assume they'll be mining for themselves with all this hardware. Anyway, the realistic way to deal with a couple of giant pools possibly getting too much of the network is to create a few more giants, ensuring that the pie is always divided enough to prevent any players from going above 40% of the network for any significant period of time. KnC won't have 20 PH for a couple more months at least. I don't think we should assume ghash.io or anyone else will stop growing in the meantime. Finally, if you're worried about the network being too centralized, buy your own miners, as I have, and run them yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:27:45
Thanks for the info. And yeah, I'm pretty disappointed in KnC. In retrospect, however, it's always been clear that a company that churns out ASIC miners has much more to gain by keeping them and mining themselves. That I expected a business - even a private one - to take a pass on potential profit so that their hobbyist customers could make a buck was pretty naive. Since I take a tax hit regardless,  I might as well take the refund and a buy BTC with it. The only bright spot in all this is that I'll end up with 20 BTC when I paid just under 12.

@_date: 2014-02-05 04:35:56
It sounds like you're focusing your feelings about the growth of the network on KnC. So, you wanted them to ship a ton more hashpower in December and January because the competition shipped a lot of miners, but you don't want them to add a bunch of hashpower in the future because it'll cut into your returns? People want to buy hashpower, and if they don't get it from KnC, clearly they'll get it elsewhere. I'm fascinated by all the griping about absolutely anything and everything KnC does, as if KnC should run their business based on the expectations of a handful of petulant kids.
@_date: 2014-07-05 15:58:14
I was trying to come up with a commodity or product valued primarily for its utility, where that utility is relatively likely not to change much with technology for the next few decades, that could serve as a better measure of BTC's spending power. I ruled out gold, because while it's certainly useful, its value is based more on its perceived value as an investment. I thought about food commodities like wheat, since those will retain utility, but technology could make it vastly cheaper in the future, or the climate and population growth could make it much more expensive. I decided nickel might be a good candidate, since its utility as a catalyst and in alloys seems likely to remain.
@_date: 2014-02-05 04:27:47
They're selling the hashpower. And they are giving those who ordered Neptunes some assurance that they'll get 3TH before Q2 ends whether Neptune is late or not. How is that bad for the customers? If KnC existed in a vacuum, this could kinda suck, but the network is growing fast whether KnC adds this hashpower and sells it - or mines with it, for that matter - or not.

If your parents aren't able to retrieve your property from the principal, your next stop should be the local paper. Nobody wants to be known as someone who steals from kids. Have a ton of resources lined up to help the journalist do the proper research.

A side benefit is that your community gets to learn something about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:46:17
I'll explain my thinking further. For the sake of argument, let's say that an anarcho-capitalist revolution has so thoroughly destroyed society that there are no businesses, corporations, families, or other organizations that have any advantage to start with. We're starting from scratch, here. People will start to use the environment's limited resources, as they always have, to survive. They will find it advantageous to cooperate and trade, and businesses will form, cities will grow, and some people and businesses will be more successful than others, and will gain advantages as a result. 
Inevitably, peoples' and businesses' property rights will begin to conflict. Economic activity on one person's property will adversely affect the economic activity on or the enjoyment of another person's property. Business A will claim the same resources as Business B, and rightful ownership will need to be established somehow. In the absence of an entity with a monopoly on violence, the stronger of the two parties in the conflict will prevail because there's nothing to stop it fighting for its' "right" to that property more violently than the weaker party. 
So through this process, some businesses or organizations will become enormous. For instance, a retailer might eventually have enough resources to build roads so that it can more efficiently move goods. And since the roads aren't public, the retailer could choose not to allow any competing businesses to use them. Any competitor would have to build its own, making the barrier to entry in that market too high for a startup to overcome. 
In some markets, of course, several competing businesses might become powerful and begin to see how costly all these violent conflicts and competition are becoming. They will instead choose to fix prices and salaries, or make an agreement to become a cartel controlling the supply and therefore price of a resource.
All of these things lead to something similar to our situation today, where a few very powerful conglomerates/corporations/cartels have the power to control what resources and opportunities are available to the masses, and the only thing that will stop it is the same greed that has killed growth in demand in our current economic system. Once the masses have nothing left to spend, the temple built on their backs will collapse.
It's been happening forever, and it's what the Founders were trying to prevent when they gave life to the USA. The ideals were there, but our execution hasn't been so great. Money and greed are more powerful than any system yet tried.
What we really need is a level of technology that provides effectively unlimited energy and gives us such control of matter that our material wants and needs are always satisfied. Only then could Anarchy be viable. Tied to Capitalism, it's nothing more than a fantasy, and our attempts at it have been and will be terrible and destructive.

I guess things like VAT and the exchange rate at purchase make a pretty serious difference in your ROI. Your difficulty projection is pretty similar to mine, as is your start date, but I only laid out 60BTC to begin with. I do find it interesting, however, that your chart shows you breaking even just a couple weeks after the last period there. Factor in the now official hashrate of 550+ GH/s for a Jupiter, and you'd have done pretty well had you decided not to cancel.
@_date: 2013-09-30 13:04:03
My own forecasts, taking the most pessimistic, but reasonable circumstances as given, show me breaking even around the new year. If my Jupiter ends up being delivered this week and difficulty ends up right around 1 Billion on Jan 1, then I'll break even by December. My electricity costs are nil, so unless the miner dies this year, I won't be sorry I ordered.
I use a modified version of a publicly available spreadsheet to forecast difficulty. I plug in numbers based on past rises and anticipated releases of additional hashpower to the network, and for the past two months, my near-term predictions have turned out close to, but worse than the reality that comes to pass. I think difficulty will be just a shade under 1,000,000,000 on Jan 1.

Well, my point is that BTC can't get big enough for universal acceptance without either making some concessions to the current system, or waiting for the current system to go down in flames. The protocol is flexible enough that I think we can make some concessions to allow BTC to grow enough to become a more powerful agent of change, and do things to further protect privacy once its too late for governments to crush it. I think it's a fine line we need to walk if we want BTC to succeed. That said, even if it doesn't succeed because of regulation or privacy being destroyed, the idea is now out there, and something better will take its place. People want the freedom that cryptocurrency can provide, and so they will continue to work toward it. 
I also think we have to allow for a fair and transparent way to provide for funding of the services people actually want from government - education, defense, public infrastructure, and the like. These needs are the reason people create governments, along with the need to have someone enforce the rules that enable us to trust those we do business with to not screw us, and have recourse when they do. I'm not saying our current governments are ideal. They are human creations, after all. But we need to be careful not to make it too easy to cheat whatever system we agree to live within. Again, it's a fine line we must walk, but I think that because most people ultimately want the same things - a balance of freedom and security, some prosperity and some free time - that things will work out eventually. I think the current system is way out of balance and that big change is inevitable. BTC is a tool that can help us build a better system once the current one collapses. 
I agree the current system sucks, and it's craving for more power and control reflects the fact that deep down, those who benefit most from the status quo are well aware of the underlying weakness.

Because of bitcoin's global nature, I don't think laws will be enough to prevent people from using it as they wish. The law would instead weaken the government by encouraging the growth of gray and black markets for even perfectly legal goods and services. Governments grab for power when they lose their strength, and I think the US government has lost its strength, and now grabs for power with laws like the Patriot Act. People tend not accept living for too long in a system where the government's power is pervasive. This is why governments tend not to last more than a century or two, and why dissent can flash over to revolution in a relative blink of an eye. If that day comes for Western "Democracies," having bitcoin will be invaluable. It is an agent of change that can serve to redistribute the power that banks and governments have taken for themselves, and as someone else said in another thread, governments tend not to be able to keep up when they decide to crush a useful technology.

Now I understand you. I'm holding, believe me. And what I want to fix is the economic imbalance caused by a handful of people accumulating 90% of the world's wealth, and at the same time, refusing to invest in the people and infrastructure that created all that wealth to begin with. I don't think Bitcoin can fix that problem, but may be a tool that can help. That said, I think the most likely scenario is that the problem will fix itself, though in a way that's pretty painful for just about everyone. Middle Class pockets are empty, and the institutions that were created to help them grow and prosper are being systematically dismantled, or starved of funding. This lack of investment in society stifles the economy and will bring about a day when the markets suddenly realize that almost every asset is worth far less than it appears, and then the chaos begins. 2008 was nothing. What's coming will be catastrophic.
So perhaps you're right, and Bitcoin is just another of those assets, but the ideals of those that created it are real and could help shape the society that emerges from the ashes.

What if that company has proven themselves trustworthy? Lets say KnC announces their Gen 2 miners after delivering Gen 1 more or less on time. If you've decided you want a Gen 2 miner, which would you prefer: 1) To be able to pre-order the way people do for new video games and hot consumer electronic devices, and then know that you have an early spot reserved in the queue, or 2) Sit for hours hammering F5 along with 20,000 other people as the website struggles and fails? What if when you started your order, you were in the first 100, but due to the site being backed up, you end up having to start over and find yourself number 20,000 instead, and your miner to be delivered 30 days later than if you'd been number 100? 
I don't think anyone wants to deal with the latter situation. No one wants to be ripped off, either. But Bitcoin mining, now that more than a handful of people are aware of it, will never again guarantee large profits. It is a risk, whether you're pre-ordering, or paying the vastly inflated price an in-stock miner commands. See Block Eruptors for an example of what happens when you can order and expect delivery within a few days.

You aren't wrong to distrust the government, and your example of drug criminalization as evidence that at least part, if not all, of the US gov't doesn't care about the greater good or about creating black markets is valid. But if BTC gets a sufficient foothold before the use of non-validated addresses or tainted coins is made illegal - and remember that CoinValidation sounds like it's currently not much more than a big idea with unclear means of implementing it - then the government may find itself in the position of either making a large part of the population's money worthless or making those same people criminals if they try to continue using their money. The government doesn't care about the greater good, but it certainly cares about its continued survival. I'm not sure how things will all work out, but I believe that bitcoin is a sound enough idea that anything but the most draconian laws wouldn't do much to change the way it is used, and I believe that those draconian laws, in combination with other things like the NSA's unwarranted snooping, could bring about a situation where people understand that voting for change is no longer working, and decide collectively to make the changes themselves.

They want to spend their money safely, but they also want to know that no entity can declare their money worthless. People will accept a lot of bullshit from their governments, and they'll pay their taxes and all that, too. But when the government actually tries to destroy peoples' money, that's when the pitchforks come out.

I think that through November or maybe early December, you get a pretty good estimate of difficulty increases. Beyond that, however, assuming a constant % difficulty increase gives you increasingly absurd results. An increase of 30% when difficulty is at 200MM is 60MM in one jump, the equivalent of adding 500TH or to the network. That is a plausible scenario. Consider, however, what happens by December with difficulty at 1B - higher than I'd predict. A 30% jump would be an increase in difficulty of 300MM. You'd have to add nearly 2500TH to the network in 10 days. I suppose it could happen, but if there's 7PH at 1B difficulty already, it means HashFast and Cointerra have already both delivered. Who else will be able to add that much hashpower? And then if you still keep adding 30%, a month later, you have to add 5000TH the next jump. That just can't happen. ASICS just can't get that cheap that fast. So while large amounts of hashpower will continually be added to the network, it will amount to a smaller and smaller percentage of the overall hashrate. Growth will transistion from the current crazy exponential rush to a more pedestrian linear rate.

I was halfway through putting together a very similar reply when I read this. I couldn't agree more. Deflation should be fine so long as the rate is not too volatile, and it is expected and can be accounted for by those making loans or saving for future purchases.

A lot of people in this sub seem to think that the people trading Bitcoin aren't in it for the money, and that we should be able to just close our eyes, ignore fundamentals, and hold the price at its ATH by the sheer force of our belief in Bitcoin. It's a nice thought, but even if every person on refused to ever sell, the market would move without them. You either try to take advantage in order to increase your wealth, or you get angry or sad about it and just take whatever the market dishes out.

I think KnC may be the first ASIC manufacturer to be able to simply take reservations and/or deposits rather than requiring the pre-order to be fully paid. They should have plenty of capital to cover NRE of a Gen 2 ASIC now that they have a working Gen 1 product delivered just hours past their self-imposed target date. I imagine Marcus is fairly deep into the design the Gen 2 already. Here's hoping that with the extra time and capital he is able to do a full custom design.

This is the saddest part. People are going to buy and sell drugs. Eliminating a venue that allows that market to exist with much less violence than on the streets serves only to harm society, not help it. 
That said, did anyone catch the bit about DPR soliciting a hitman to murder someone who threatened to release IRL information about SR dealers and possibly admins? Very sad if those allegations are true, and sadder still if the murder took place.

That sounds like something meant to sound nice, but thousands of years of human history proves it wrong. Avarice is a powerful force, and money is a hell of a drug. Unfortunately, when it comes to business, rules must be clear, and a trusted entity must enforce and arbitrate. Avarice gets at even the arbiter eventually, and that's when you have a revolution.

Personally, if the price is crashing, I don't pick a value to buy back at. I watch for the point where big buy orders - 50+ coins - start executing every few seconds. Once it looks like the big buys are balancing the big sells, I give it a minute to confirm the change in momentum, and then put in a buy order at a couple bucks higher than it would need to be to clear the order book up to a certain price if it executed instantly. Usually, most of the order executes at a lower price. If it doesn't execute completely right away, I let it sit. No need to panic, the price usually flaps around as momentum reverses, and the order completes in a few minutes. I find doing the reverse at the top of a swing much more difficult, so I tend to play it quite conservatively. I've had whales fuck me with a big sell more than once when I've tried to eke out that extra bit of profit.
@_date: 2013-09-11 17:56:32
I'm glad to know it isn't just me. I took advantage of some fairly wild swings in price right before the Bitstamp API started showing signs of issues, and thought maybe Coinbase was sticking me with a low, static sell price as a result.

What exactly do you expect as far as "proof" goes? It isn't exactly difficult to make a video of a box with fans and a screen with CGMiner output and call it "proof". Same goes for a die shot. It wouldn't prove anything if KnC were to release those things. As with any company promising new ASIC miners, you have to pretty much ignore their efforts at marketing and gather enough information on your own to decide whether you trust them. The only real proof comes when the first coins show up in your wallet.
EDIT: grammar

I'm not feeling safe yet at ~$500. I'm playing the volatility, but when in doubt, I'm going fiat until the China situation plays out. Usually, there's plenty of time to buy low after climactic drop like this one appears to be. Much more important to act quickly near the top.

I'm curious what you find so difficult about buying from Coinbase. It's the easiest place I've found to buy them, and I can do so in seconds. The only downside is the limit of 10 instant coins/week.

Say what? It dropped by $200 for just minutes, and then went back up $100. Then it slowly declined for about 3 months, and has been steadily climbing for another 3 - 4 months since. I'm not saying there won't be a major correction, but the DDoS on Gox in April is what triggered the panic that resulted in a crash rather than a correction. In addition, the memory of that crash is fresh, and all those people that lost big because they panic sold last time will be much less likely to do it again.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:54:41
I'm trying to understand where you're coming from here. To me, what you're saying sounds awfully defeatist. Are you saying that there's no hope of changing the current system, so why even bother trying? Or just that Bitcoin is fatally flawed because currently, most people who want coins have to buy them with fiat? Or is it that you see this as a zero sum game, where for the people to win, banks/government/The Man must lose?
Let me ask you this - despite Bitcoin not living up to your personal ideal standard, is the world better off or worse with Bitcoin in its current form? I think you just need to be patient. The power of big finance can't be immediately eliminated, nor can a cryptocurrency be adopted without a period of coexistence with the current paradigm. The Bitcoin experiment isn't done with yet, nor is it the final step in breaking free from the .0001% who have sucked so much wealth from everyone else. But as has happened many times before, they've sown the seeds of their own destruction. There are too many of us and too few of them, and it is we who are the source of their wealth. Bitcoin is a tool - or maybe just the prototype for a tool - that can help us fix this broken system.

Your coins aren't on any red or blacklists yet, though. And really, wouldn't it be a bad thing if these exchanges, who can withdraw directly from your traditional bank account, didn't try to make sure it's really you authorizing them to do so? So long as there's still a need to exchange BTC for fiat, that validation will be necessary to protect your fiat account, even if it allows banks or the government some insight into your dealings. But it certainly isn't the same as some entity declaring some coins are worthless just because someone accepted them as payment for a counterfeit watch on Canal Street three years before they ever circulated their way into your hands.
@_date: 2013-10-01 03:05:39
I don't know about that. With KnC and Bitfury succeeding, the barriers to entry for manufacturers are increasing as well. If HashFast or Cointerra - or both - also do as promised, the ASIC miner business will become an even tougher one to crack. 
And remember those numbers. There is a price floor for ASIC miners, and we're going to find it sooner than later. This growth is unsustainable.

Interesting. The past 24 hours, Gox is back on top by quite a margin over Bitstamp, about 11700. If Bitstamp volume becomes consistently higher than Gox, then people will start using the Bitstamp price by default. Not only that, but the prices will probably be about the same on both exchanges at that point, if not higher on Bitstamp. I suppose then people will start to bitch that everyone is allowing the Bitstamp price to fuel their wildly optimistic speculation.
@_date: 2013-07-17 12:26:43
Assuming you mean "single digits," holding wouldn't send any message at all. Buying all the BTC you can, on the other hand, sends a message of confidence in Bitcoin. Selling at a huge loss, on the other hand, says you think the idea has failed. That, or it says you're out of drugs and need cash NOW.

The Coinbase price followed Bitstamp down to $115, and I happened to catch it and bought in. Earlier today, the Coinbase sell price switched briefly to the Mt. Gox price, and I caught that, too. I made more money today with 4 keystrokes than I did at my job.

Pennies? Maybe for the fab, but you're mostly right about the price of the chips. The rest of the miner doesn't get any cheaper, though. And you're ignoring the sheer size of those numbers. If you believe them, you're saying you believe that by January or early February, we'll be adding 5PH a week to the network, and then 8 or 9PH a week in March. Even at $1/GH, that's $60,000,000 in mining rigs added in two months. Then the month after that, another $80,000,000. It'd be something like $280,000,000 spent to keep up with 30% increases in June. These are rough numbers, but you see where this is going, right? People are not going to spend nearly $1,000,000,000 on mining rigs in the first half of 2014.
If you aren't familiar with the concept of compound interest, you should be. Imagine if you had $100, and invested in something that give you a 30% increase every 10 days or so. After a year, you'd have more than $1.25MM! After two years, $16 Billion. Expecting difficulty to increase for more than a few months at 30% every 10 days is about as likely as you turning a hundred bucks into $16,000,000,000 in a couple of years.

This is much better advice for individuals than it is for governments. It is much easier to balance a government budget simply by wisely choosing policies that encourage long-term growth than it is to slash and burn. Everyone thinks cutting the budget is a great plan until it negatively affects them personally, and the resulting political games tend to have negative results. Sequestration has yet to take full effect, and there isn't much room to argue that less overall spending in an economy is good for growth. All that said, none of this addresses the question posed in the OP...will the inevitable stupid policy set by stupid, shortsighted politicians lead to a rise in the USD value of BTC?
