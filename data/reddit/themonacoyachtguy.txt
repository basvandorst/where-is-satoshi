Send it to me in Monaco and I can change it into GBP  for you... promise I will send it back. ��

Never, EVER, keep cash or crypto on exchanges. MTGox quite adequately demonstrated this...

True but only put cash / crypto in when you want to trade and then pull out as soon as the trades are completed. It’s a pain in the arse but Better to be safe than sorry. ��

True but these are pretty minimal in the grand scheme of things.... although I suppose this is relative to the amount you are dealing with and where you are trading it. Coinbase for example is a farce.

Fair to say you are checking three times, double checking twice and triple checking once.

I’d be happy with 0.1 BTC from you if you are feeling charitable. It’s all relative.

Yes but it doesn’t seem to allow the option.

My company accepts bitcoin for yacht charter (rental)... might be one for the hobby list.

ETH has been a fine horse to back in BTC's place... I'm an ETH believer in the long term.
It is just a shame the price seems to shit itself every time there is a BTC correction!

My thinking is the mega hype we are seeing coupled with some serious whale activity is driving this. This is leading BTC on an ascent which is going to explode at some stage (no idea when of course!). 
My rational is that the ETH Blockchain is so much better designed / equipped to handle transactions than BTC’s going forward and more and more people are going to cotton on to this. 
As it stands I know several people who have chucked in £5k-10k or even more without having a clue what BTC is. This will change as more easily digestible explanations come out and it will follow with them adjusting positions on ETH and BTC.

Not working for me on either... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:56:08
Fair point. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:51
Seems so!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:42
 says it is back up above $11k...

Best company I have come across so far for bulk buying / selling is  
Minimum transaction size is USD 100,000.

My company has been accepting crypto for over a year now for both charter (rental) and sales...

Looks like a member of UKIP (those not from the UK will probably have no idea what that means so apologies)
