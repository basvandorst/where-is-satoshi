here's what mining looks like right now:
Mining at home is a waste of time, energy, and money.
Cloud mining was not designed to make money for those "investing" in mining contracts.

That's one way to get small amounts :)

I placed an order and paid, but didn't get a bitpay invoice.  This concerns me.  Customer support says it takes 24 hours.  Is this true?

Comparing Bitcoin to personal checks is a bit of a stretch...

She just asked what "you guys would do" if banks lower their fees.  What?

Wasn't Neo offering this feature before it folded?  I think it'd be awesome.  I'd feel a lot better showing circle to friends and family.

Anybody seen Friedcat lately?
Here's the big Bitfury mine in Republic of Georgia:  
That video gave me the chills when I first saw it.  Mining BTC is serious business now.

If you underclock it and set the fan speed to auto it will make it much quieter.  Still wouldn't want it in my bedroom, though.

They most definitely care about the blocksize: 
They are on fire this week as well:

Glad to see Dave Carlson still going at it.

Bitfury's Georgian data center is not in the US, fyi.

Why did you not utilize an escrow service?

Looks like it may be the largest difficulty increase since February.

Looks like a scam.

Are you sure?  I have owned bitfury mining equipment in the past.
Also this:

the link is to .co not .com, be wary.

please note that the link in the article is to an imposter website.  This is likely not a real product.

The whole mining community, or what's left of it, would like to know ;)
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:32:05
Are any of your mines using 2016 BW or Bitfury assembled miners, or did the MBP model switch to Bitmain miners only?

There's nothing on bitcointalk about cex.io at all other than a   solid advertising budget:

There should be a flood of ASIC mining units hitting the market over the next few months, then you should decide.  It is very difficult to calculate whether or not your investment will be profitable based on difficulty increases.

make it illegal. shut it down.

Everything was okay until "blah blah volatile blah blah".  It's almost as if they want to discourage viewers from doing their own research.

I made an account and bought 5 gh/s.  If was fine all night, but the last 9 blocks show that I haven't submitted any shares...

They accepted payment with Paypal.  That combined with Amex is reason enough for a lot of buyers to gamble on terrahash.

I wish I could justify the markup and take the plunge on the new silver coins.

If you live in an apartment, contracts make sense, but you pay a premium. 
My new BFL little singles (30gh/s) are quite loud and I'm considering paying someone to house them for me instead of having them in my bedroom.
The USB miners are a cheap and quiet option, but it's hard to guess when the price of them will stop dropping.

Coinbase.com can usually deposit coins in your account after 4 business days.  The catch is you have to link your bank account and the test deposits can take the same time (another 3 business days) to hit your account. 
Try craigslist too, not everyone uses localbitcoins.
If that doesn't work, it's possible there's someone on bitcointalk.org that would be willing to help you out.

CBX sucks so hard today.  That's all.

A change to the GUI is essential for widespread adoption. I LOVE the big icons and simplicity.  I've always imagined my mom trying to use bitcoin, and the qt client is just too complicated.  For technical users it is great, but most people will simply need to send and receive coins, and look up past transactions.  I think mandatory labels for personal addresses is a good idea. Good luck with your efforts!  
It just hit me...new users are not likely to download the qt client due to the blockchain size issue.

Newsflash! Bitcoin magically came into existence just a few years ago.

There is a hologram covering up the private key on the card which enables spending the funds.  If the hologram were removed, it could be assumed that the account has been compromised or is in use.
