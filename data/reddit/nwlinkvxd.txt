In the show Scrubs, the main character's full name is John Dorian.

Their CEO finally responded about this on the thread over at asking mods there to delist Kraken from the header. It's not enough, but it's something.

While reading the server-side stubs where he describes how simplified and abstracted this should be, I had an overwhelming sense of "Holy crap, this is actually happening".
I am now absolutely confident that Bitcoin will succeed.
@_date: 2011-06-06 13:21:39
Sure. Why not?

He wouldn't be able to sell them all, and doing so would drastically move the market downward. You'd see the same effect if Warren Buffet suddenly decided to dump all his stocks to cash.

Not sure what you mean by "ewallet" in this case. If you're looking for a web-based wallet so you don't have to run the client, check out [instawallet](

It's seriously not worth it. Join a small pool like MtRed or something. Diversity keeps the network secure.

If you have the capital to buy and keep such items in stock, you should look into becoming a Bitcoin reseller for people to purchase products from ThinkGeek and Jinx for starters, or maybe even Newegg.

Did you try to make a transaction without paying the 0.01BTC fee?
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:43:02
Use a unique receiving address for each transaction.

Where does one procure beer with bitcoins?

Ben Bernanke?

btw, the beer never arrived

Excellent points. Thanks.

Because the dollar is a fiat currency and thus only backed by the American government, it is effectively only backed by our military firepower, goods/services we are willing to sell for dollars, and the people who are willing to hold it as legal tender. Likewise, Bitcoin is only really backed by its security against fraud and inflation, goods/services we are willing to sell for Bitcoin, and the people who are willing to hold it as legal tender.
You are right to say that Warren Buffet would lose control over any assets he has made public should he decide to sell off his shares for USD. The analogy here certainly isn't perfect, as a closer comparison would be selling off shares of UbiBEX (or whatever that exchange "company" is called), to get Bitcoin. Still, if Warren Buffet were to suddenly exchange all his dollars for Euro or Omani Rial overnight, I bet you'd see the dollar take a pretty big plunge (even with ~14-17 billion in circulation). The fact is that like those super-rich pseudonymous accounts holding tons of Bitcoin: everyone is watching to see what he does.

HELL YES. Thank you! I just bought 6x Affligem Triple for ฿04.02 after tax and shipping.

I appreciate the reminder we are on the internet. Sometimes I forget.

Excellent! Thanks for the reply.

still waiting on Starbucks......
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:05:29
I just had this happen with a blockchain wallet, and after 3 days the transaction disappeared and I got the coins back.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:23:31
I'm definitely interested
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:45:00
I know Gyft supports adding existing Starbucks cards, but you really need to add the ability to buy them with bitcoin as well...
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:08:52
Dodged a bullet, thanks to you.

Bitcoin depends on the internet for its blockchain, but blockchains don't depend on the internet. A well designed occasionally-connected mesh network between offline devices could theoretically utilize a DHT and a blockchain for validating transactions, which (optionally) would be periodically dumped into the main block chain through nodes which do travel into areas with connectivity.

Governments could ban businesses from publicly advertising that they accept Bitcoin, which would restrict the growth of the market. That's about it.
