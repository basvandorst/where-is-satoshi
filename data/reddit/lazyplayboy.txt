How are the users responsible at all?!! Users just want their transactions to go through. They don’t want to be waiting and seeing if may be this time they put up just enough satoshi to get their transaction taken up, and not have their transaction orphaned, and their purchase denied, like last time.
BTC never used to be like this. It’s a shadow of its former-self.
Stop blaming the victims.

Not really, it’s got a lot worse in the last 12 months. It used to be a lot about “the best way to make BTC valuable is to *use it*”. i.e. not only for savings but also for day-to-day purchases wherever possibly.
Now day-to-day purchases aren’t possible, but the newcomers (who by definition of the current price) massively outnumber the old-guard, have to repeat the hodl crap to maintain the emperors new cloths.

Yeah, that's the theory. The wallet.dat should contain a spare 100 unused address. However, there is an example of a guy who lost over 7000 BTC when he assumed a new address was already in the backup copy of wallet.dat. Turns out it wasn't.
@_date: 2011-06-13 19:49:18
It's not at all overkill for 'a few grand'. It only takes a few minutes to look after and it's very unlikely to break. Multiple off site back up is a must, and that demands encryption. I don't understand why you wouldn't.
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:22:20
How does the new address get the bitcoins to donate with? - It's transferred from one of your other address and the transfer is trackable.
Either trade for USD then back again using different bitcoin addresses, or use an online bitcoin laundry service.
@_date: 2011-06-15 11:28:46


I'll add one note - only send BTC to the address already in use on the savings wallet.dat. If you want to use a new address, don't rely on the client having already stored 100 unused on the backed up wallet.dat.
There is an account of someone losing over 7000 BTC because they thought a new address would be already on the backed up wallet.dat.

It wouldn't be encrypted and it'd only be one backup. I don't think that's a sensible way to look after a lot of money.
There is talk soon the client will only store an encrypted version of the wallet, in which case this approach (hard link to dropbox) will work great, so long as you make a redundant backup too.

BTC has been over $500 for the last 12 months. That size of drop would comparable to the Dec 2013 drop, but it's important to note that the price after the 2013 bubble nonetheless remained a good deal higher than that before the bubble.
I think it will continue to bubble further, then drop and 'stagnate' at $1500 for a good while. Too many will be willing to jump in before it drops further than that.
@_date: 2011-05-24 06:06:18
Encrypted off site backups will solve that. This problem is specifically about encrypting the copy of wallet.dat actually used by the client.
@_date: 2011-06-15 11:23:52

Not in the same way. Counterfeiting fiat is common but it does not erode *all* confidence. It erodes confidence in proportion to the magnitude of the counterfeiting. Counterfeiting fiat is becomes increasingly difficult with the scale of the operation.
It's possible that counterfeiting bitcoins (i.e. a &gt;51% attacks) is an all-or-nothing affair. Small entities are entirely powerless to affect the network, so there's no analogy to the small scale back-alley counterfeiting operation. But if a large enough entity takes an interest and succeeds in maintaining &gt;51% then bitcoin *as a whole* falls. How likely is that? I don't know, but (BTC Guild)[ currently has 34% of the network hashing power.

Nothing is stopping you, except any practical difficulty you might have in dealing in Bitcoin. Anyone with a brain remembers that prices can go down as well as up, and don't bet with something you can't afford to lose. After that, go for it.
The only thing causing the increase in Bitcoin price is a increase in public *confidence* in Bitcoin. If, for any reason, that fails in the next couple of weeks you'll lose most of your $1000. Feel lucky? It wouldn't be the first time public confidence failed massively, suddenly and without warning...

I'll assume you were using the standard client, known as bitcoin-qt.
On that old harddrive should be a wallet.dat file - it contains the private keys to the bitcoin addresses you were using at that time. If you can recover that file you can almost certainly recover your coins. The old clients didn't support encryption, so unless you went through an extra step of encrypting the wallet.dat it's probably in plain text.
If you can get the old wallet.dat, and it was the bitcoin-qt client that you were using I'd simply install bitcoin-qt again, then replace the new wallet.dat file with your old one. Installing bitcoin-qt is a bit of a pain because it takes ages to download the blockchain.
There's no activation required at all. The bitcoins are still associated with the original address. If you know the address you can see how many bitcoins it contains using  But you need the private keys in order to move those bitcoins to another address.
One caveat: if you recover the old wallet.dat, then proceed to use it to do transactions (lots of transactions) you may get to the stage where the old wallet.dat file on the old harddrive will not work. This is an edge case because the wallet.dat file in current use would be fine, it's simply the case that old backups of a wallet.dat can become invalid, if another version of that wallet.dat has been in use elsewhere - it's to do with 'change' being sent to a new address on each transaction.

Bullshit. Why would they ship in good time? The temptation to delay shipping as much as possible is far too great for any company to resist. They can behave as badly as they like and they'll still have customers falling over themselves to throw money at them. As far as I can see it, legal action that threatens to ruin them is the only thing that would force them to ship.
No company wants to be the first to ship. They're far better off running the machines themselves for the time being.

I asked the same question a while back, I got this response from *pa2013*:


For what it does, the Appstore Blockchain app is nice. But I think the above points are reasonable criticism.

I didn't sell because 1) it's an interesting experiment 2) I spent a trivial amount initially so it's not an investment and doesn't need to pay for itself 3) I don't need the money, but mostly 4) it's a right PITA to change bitcoin to anything useable in my country.

Bitcoin isn't big enough to interest governments.
If Bitcoin becomes big enough to be useful then it'll be big enough to interest governments. *Then* things will get interesting.

Throughout human history gold has been lost - think of shipwrecks.
I'll concede the analogy breaks down in the modern era because we can pretty much recover anything from the bottom of the ocean if it's worth it, but the precedence is there.

I think you're all being strung a line. I mean, why would they ship as soon as they can? It'd be far too much temptation for any company not to run the miners themselves for as long as they can get away with it.

Poor analogy. Unless you want to tell me how the founder of Napster is spending the rest of his useful life in prison.

Indeed, you're right. You can only enter amounts in BTC, though, which would be a valid and potentially useful function. Although my desktop client is completely ignorant of exchange rates and I can't say I really care.

Edit: It's a nice idea. Just that...
This is redundant. A single character substitution will almost certainly make the address invalid. [This is the blockchain.info link of the first address]( - it's valid. [This is the blockchain.info link of the second address, with a single character substitution]( - it's invalid.
Though I'll try to find out exactly how unlikely it is to accidentally come up with a wrong but valid address.
edit: [The bitcoin wiki]( suggests the chance of accidentally creating a wrong but valid address is 1 in 2^32 (4.29 billion). That's good enough not to worry about single character substitutions. Any two valid addresses will be sufficiently different so that it'd be easy enough to detect a mistake simply by trivially comparing a few characters from the beginning, middle and end of the addresses.
Still, if I were to do a major transfer I'd test the address with a small amount first anyway, to make sure that the intended recipient hadn't accidentally given me a wrong address, but that's a different issue.

Through law. Bitcoin could be made illegal to trade without a licence. Of course that wouldn't kill it, but it'd be a massive problem for day to day use of bitcoin.

You have to trust the JavaScript every time you use your wallet. Which is possible. I think there are browser plugins which will verify the JavaScript each time.
Personally, I prefer Electrum. 12 words and a password kept secret and safe, and I'm set.

But you have to reveal the private key to check it. I thought the idea of these paper bills was that you can keep the private key hidden until you want to spend, but perhaps I'm mistaken or misunderstanding you.

If bitcoin becomes useful, then it's price will be high, very high. I'll guess around $1,000. That's fine, whether or not 'average joes' can afford that is irrelevant, mBTC or smaller will still be useful for day to day usage. There's no minimum 1 BTC buy in.
But, this doesn't mean that it's worth speculating. It will take a very long time before bitcoin is useful enough to command anything like that price. Like a few decades. I don't think most speculators are willing to wait that long?
The trouble is idiots see clever-looking people claiming that, "in the future 1 BTC = $1,000" and believe it, but forget the pre-requisite that bitcoin must actually be useful first. So, everyone piles in, the price goes up, everyone says "this is it, they were right, bitcoin really *is* worth $1,000". And the inevitable happens, a few lucky greedy people manage to pay off their debts whilst the unlucky greedy are left holding the can.
Personally, given how useful Bitcoin is currently, I think 1 BTC is worth about $10-$20, [roughly it's average value over the last 2 years]( I don't see anything to suggest that bitcoin has become any more useful in the last few months.

If Bitcoin relies on philanthropic donation then it's a failure. It's not supposed to be necessary.
A counter argument could be that such donation is okay in the bootstrap phase.
But who knows how long that's supposed to last. I'd argue that the bootstrap phase has long since passed, now that 1 BTC has significant value, and by now the network should be self-supporting.
If I, as a young man, want to prove myself able to support myself, would I really want my parents to keep giving me an allowance payment every month?

Which client are you using? Syncing can take an unreasonable amount of time (days). I suggest using a thin client, such as electrum. Electrum also lets you recreate your wallet much more safely to prevent loss of coins.
There's a steep learning curve in front of you. You need to learn how to keep your wallet safe from loss and secure from theft.

Bitcoin doesn't care what's 'bad' for it. It is a mere *thing* without self-preservation instincts. Isn't Bitcoin a tool for anyone and everyone to use it as they see fit?
Manipulation for profit may well be bad for those who want to see Bitcoin grow as a currency, but if Bitcoin can't ride out that manipulation then it deserves to fail.
