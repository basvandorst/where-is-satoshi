Bitcoin has nurtured a culture as disconnected from reality as the average Trump supporter.  If Bitcoin doesn't get it's fees down and it's speed up it is toast.  Bitcoin is good for nothing but cyber war at this time.  Bitcoin is only good for dodging sanctions and paying high priced hackers.

Time to invest in a more promising (criminal) crypto.

Magic internet money is just a meme.  To believe crypto won't be influenced by supply amd demand is magical thinking.

Looks like Bitcoin is searching for a bottom.  If I was a betting man and I am, I would bet it goes considerably lower.  Bitcoin has been trading in a range and going lower and lower.  A couple days ago I told my buddy I thought bitcoin was gonna hit 6500.  A new 3 month low.  It did.  If on this rebound it exceeds 9000 I do think it will start going higher.  I would bet against it.  I imagine it will cap out a little over 8500.  If on this rebound it doesn't exceed 9000 it will go lower than 6500.
Bitcoin is ahead of it's time and there are only so many uses for it.  It is good for drugs, hackers, and dodging sanctions or war.  Hackers and war are about the same thing.  This means the chances of regulation are high.  Which ever coin can dodge the law is going to win.  I would bet against Bitcoin.  I like Monero myself.  266 billion seems super high to me even though I think demand for a war/crime cryoto is in excess of 2 trillion dollars.  I am not convinced that countries like Russia and North Korea can feel confident enough in Bitcoin to invest heavily enough in it at this time.   Crypto investing is profiteering no matter what you tell yourself.  If you wanna make money follow this trend.

If banks stopped converting crypto to cash wouldn't that destroy it's value?

This market shit is just magical thinking.  Clearly Bitcoin can and is being manipulated.  My name is FUD.

Watch the magical thinking of the Bitcoin community.  Butthurt at any indication of malicious actors and against any regulatory body that could defend them from fuckary.

Meme for good.  The dream has to be a Tesla not a Lambo.

It is just magical thinking to believe we can keep money away from terrorists and child pornographers without government regulation.  It's an inconvenient truth.  Try not to get triggered.

People are threatened by new cryptocurrency because all this hype has lead people to adopt crypto enthusiasm into their identity.  Now people will defend Bitcoin as if it is their Lord and savior.

The demand for crypto currency is driven by a demand for drugs and hacking services.  The demand for drugs and hacking is far greater than the 15 billion or so that crypto currencies are currently worth.  The bubble won't pop until drug and hacking market cap has been reached.

I think there is a cultish following to Bitcoin who have to pretend that demand isn't driven by drugs and hacking.
There is a long history of questionable behavior driving the development of new markets.  VHS was adopted over the superior Beta due to porn.  Internet speeds are being driven by piracy.  Just because the value of something is drive by crime doesn't make it a bad thing.  I think it makes it the best thing.

All praise be to the infinate glory of Bitcoin.
