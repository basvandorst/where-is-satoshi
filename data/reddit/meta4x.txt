It depends, is my house located in your sovereign territory?

Just made my first purchase!  I've been meaning to buy a wall mount for my TV for awhile now, and this seemed like a good time to support OverStock.com!

Already made my first purchase.  It was super simple.  Just choose BitCoin as a payment option during checkout and the site will display a payment address.  Send the appropriate amount to that address and click "Confirm Transaction" on the site a moment later.

Is there a story here?  If so, spill it!

You might want to eliminate the "Find Agent Location" and "Pick Your Wallet" buttons, as they don't serve much purpose on a printed item.  Maybe a URL for a helpful Bitcoin introductory website would be better?

You can buy insurance (title insurance and home owner's insurance) to protect that investment.  Where is my BTC insurance?

I imagine this will just lead to a black(er) market for BitCoin in China.  People will pay local miners under the table to transfer fiat into BTC.

PIA started accepting BitCoin for VPN accounts months ago.
