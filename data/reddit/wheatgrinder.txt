I always thought the blockchain contained all the info for all transactions.  Can you back trace your current coins\address  to the transaction you started with?  
My general experience with taxes is that estimations are just fine for complicated historical stuff.  If you can guess at the dates you were working with and get the average bitcoin price for some range of dates,  you should be able to estimate your earnings.  I think you just need to report the profit on transactions, not on your current holdings. though I'm sure there are some complications around investment type holdings that are beyond me.   If you report ALL income on your taxes you should be ok.

I went though a lot of trouble to setup a paper wallet etc.. but alas, thats $5 likely lost to the ether.  FYI: I loaded the address with $5 before giving it,  so I can see everything working right.  My plan was to give the paper wallet, then show him how easy it was to use my phone to transfer a more appropriate sum ($50)  and then show him how to check the value on blockchain as part of the "gift" .. but recipient not really interested.

I has been fun, and this really inst about convincing YOU as you are clearly in love with your belief system and cannot extract your self from the narrative you created.  Hopefully someone else will read and stop to think about what is really happening to their western civilization and culture.   
Specifics issues with your above rebuttal: 


Leaving the village at 5 or 7 is not the same as growing up in the village.  Your pretty anecdote does not pertain to the example I gave of a formed adult, with his culture fully internalized, both in MIND and BODY, migrating to the western world.  Your subjective experience is not supported by the actual data.  


I think this is a great example of the power of anger and action.  Talk and ideas did not end that conflict.


We Agree, but you only want to look at the science that reinforces your ideals, there is plenty of data showing race is a factor in measured intelligence.  


There is plenty of data that shows diverse societies are higher stress, higher violence and lower trust than homogeneous societies.  
The astute observer can see this is "true" by simple observation of their local, national and global societies.   Compare violent crime rates across the world.  Homogeneous societies are much safer than diverse ones.  
You seem to forget that this "western civilization" you love so much was not created in a melting pot, until less than 80 years ago UK and US were nearly 90% homogenized white folk.  It was these very "un-diverse" societies that gave us the fundamental advancements that allow us to have this conversation.  


I think we probably agree that the singularity has already arrived,  there rate of change in all areas of human understanding is increasing at an exponential rate, the future life of an average human is no longer predictable at birth.  For those following along at home think about it like this: 
Until just one or two generations ago, a person born had a strong likely hood of predicting the course of their entire life based on historic examples.  *My fathers, fathers, father was miller of grain, thus I will be a miller of grain and my sons, sons will be millers.*   :-)   
This is no longer the case, change is the new normal, your being an early adopter of the technological nomadic lifestyle proves this point.   
I hope this continues, that we do arrive at a future of wonders, where creativity is the true currency of value, but that future is just a bunch of ideas in the big brains of skinny little bug men whose necks are falling under the black booted heal of multiculturalism and 17th century third world methods of problem solving.   If we can form a society unified and working together we can get to that glorious future you describe.  History shows that only homogeneous communities can deliver narrative shattering breakthrough innovations needed for the journey.  Once we are "there" we will have the abundance and can solve ALL the problems, for all societies, but, we are never going to get there if the current regressive counter trends continue unabated.   
Following your lead on ending with a quote from fictions of socialism.. 
 *"If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."   George Orwell - "1984"*
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:28:20
FYI:  The Line from Edward James Olmos is from a sci fi TV show.. not the UN.. if he said it in the UN it was written by the battle star galactica writer.  :-) 
I defer to your travel experience, but I will add the american aphorism "No matter where you go, there you are." is in effect.  You are always using the same brain to "see" the world around you. Your prejudices and observations are colored by your own mind.  As you travel you seek out that which you want to see, you are the type to draw to you positive people and experiences. This is an admirable trait and I commend your for it!  A realist will put away feeling an anecdotes of personal experience and look at measurable data.  The data shows that in all living people the heart is full of one thing, blood.  If there is no blood in the heart the person is dead. :-)
As to the mind; it is a result of the processes of the organ encased in yours and mine (oft times too thick) skull. The brain, as a physical object in our universe it is subject to disease and environmental effects like all other organs in our body.  Thus it IS subject to environmental pressure and natural selection.  Claiming that it is somehow "not subject" to differentiation along racial lines is not fact based.  Your mention that female and male brains are virtually identical is subjective.  Chimpanzee and human DNA are 99% similar, but I don't let the local zoo animals decide when I should buy bitcoin! (see what I did there? I brought it back to OP!)  There are many studies that show IQ differences among genotypes.  This discuss could be considered "hate speech"in some localities so I dont feel safe to site.  But ignore that for now.  Just focus on cultural differences, and culture is largely ethnocentric and you know it. It takes a life time of experience and inculcation to build an adult person, that persons culture is as much a part of them as is there DNA.  There are some studies that show that environmental factors, during puberty years, can result in an individuals epigenetic differences being encoded in the DNA.  Thus HOW you are raised CAN impact your DNA for future generations regardless of CULTURAL continuity.   
(  )  
Extrapolate that to a boy living in some far flung village in Africa where his family has lived for several generations.  The boy grows to man hood in that timeless beautiful rural village.  Then the boy migrates to West Berlin. Do you think he will quickly adopt the ideals of modern western civilization that are in STRICT conflict with his tribal upbringing?  Only a fool says "yes" and someone will die for that fool.. the realist see the data.  Sexual Emergencies and cultural enrichment of the vehicular man slaughter variety ensue.   


 *really?*  How far would this little family have gotten without the "rich uncle" paying the bill for all that civilizing?  
As I said, I "want" to believe in a future you describe, I am a post humanists at heart, but we will never get there if we keep pouring blood and money into "uplift" efforts.  We must FIRST secure the existence of the ideas before we can implement them.  The IDEAS are at risk of being lost to time.    
My choice is not only between "lighting a candle" and sitting back and doing nothing.  There is a third way, the way of Anger and Action!  Less than 3% of people living in the American colonies in 1776 were pro revolution.  Once it was over, everyone was on board with the program.  The men with rocks ARE coming, you can pretend they are not there, you can ignore the hammering at the gates, but you saying they are not there does not make it so.  Will you concern your self with the contents of their "hearts and minds" when the blood and brains of your young child are running in the streets?   Or more likely, you will be standing there with a rock in YOUR hand as the blood and brains flows from that racists pig that you just beat to death for not thinking like you.

Gemini not in my state either.. 
I just started playing with GDAX (still coinbase but more fun, limit orders etc.. ) GDAX uses all your coinbase account setup.  Some heart burn from coinbase here... as for some reason I got "restricted" for a few days after updating my verification to allow GDAX... but its fixed now after 5 days.  I can buy on coinbase immediately with linked debit\credit card, no problem.  I can move USD or Coin in and out of GDAX for no fees, instantaneously.  
Also Im trying to get setup on kracken but need "tier 3"  verification to add a USD account which is taking longer to get right..

I think this is why uacomment is not considered a useful metric as it can be easily spoofed\gamed.  Miners will follow the money.  That money is found in the most widely adopted binary.. market consensus achieved?  Ignorant question here: Are there more miners than authentication\full nodes (or are they the same?)

safety of exchange is not related to forks.  
Your ability to access the new coins as the result of the fork is most SAFELY guaranteed by having the coins in your OWN possession.  Not your keys = Not your coins.  
Coinbase is doing right by their customers. Probably motivated by the desire to get some of coin back into their system after the probable mass exodus to private wallets during run up to yesterdays bitcoin gold fork.

EDIT: easy to answer question..  
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:31:40
hmm.. maybe you could just allow vendors to accept bitcoin as payment option rather than provide the "conversion" service.  Converting seems VERY bad idea, particularly with CC chargeback and high volatility of btc.  You could try to simplify the end user experience of buying with bitcoin, you'll need to find a way to deal with the unavoidable btc transaction clearing time and other btc strangeness..  Now, if you really wanted to do this, your really just creating an exchange like coinbase or kraken with a retail store tacked on...  perhaps thinking of it that way will give you some different ideas.. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:11:46
no, there really isnt.. the "hardware" we have been using everyday for 20 years is not truly understood by humans.. nobody can "visualize" and understand 7 trillion transistors and the interconnections... heck, were still fighting over light being a wave or a particle!  Hardware "microchip" design using light based lithography, which uses a "mask" so small that the difference between light being a wave or a particle starts to actuary impact the layout of the mask. Thus a piece of software comes along an redraws the mask so that the fuzzy nature of light can be taken into account.   Hardware design relies on "software" to help manage the design of hardware it what is really an interdependent loop.  As the software tools advance to take over MORE of this hardware work the line will get thinner and thinner.

@_date: 2017-09-20 22:36:37
Im answering not as an expert, but in attempt to increase my own knowledge by having other correct me.. 
I like to think of margins like buying a house with a mortgage loan. 
You get a loan from the bank to buy a $100,000 house.  You have $10,000 for a down payment.  The loan from the bank is $90,000.  Next year you sell the house for $120,000 because real estate prices went up.  Neat, You earned 100% profit!  You "leveraged" the banks money ($90,000) on top of your $10,000 investment to double your $10,000 investment.  The $90,000 + your $10,000 is your total "Position" in this case $100,000.   
If your the bank, meaning your lending the money, you collect interest on the $90,000 you lent out.  
Now imagine you paid $100,000 for the house, full asking price.. you still sold it for $120,000 so you made the same $20,000 profit HOWEVER you only earned 20% return on that investment.  That's a good return, but imagine if you had used that $100,000 to buy a $1,000,000 house and sold it for $1,200,000 (thats 1.2 mil) or $100,000 profit.. now were talking real money.. :-) 
So for btc, you can allow someone to "leverage" your btc to increase their "position"  and buy a bigger chunk of btc then they could on their own.. 
Here is a bit more info on bitcoin margins, but it kinda of assumes you have the idea of margin down already..

Well one of the key concepts of bitcoin is "trust less" transactions.  You can say what ever you want, call your self Santa Clause, and swear on a stack of bibles that you are who you say you are, in the end it doesn't matter, the transaction is verified by the keys or it is not.   I think the entire concept as you laid out is not really doable in a secure way.  Perhaps you could just offer to do one on one training.  Take donations and setup skype sessions with screen sharing and walk individuals through the process.  Maybe when you've established a 1:1 relationship with an individual they could just send you some paypal money or what ever and you could buy bitcoin for them and send it to their address.. 
Really your asking people to trust you to do what conibase does.. and you dont have the infrastructure in place to really support it.  I've turned many noobs onto coinbase, its the easiest point of entry to bitcoin.

Jaxx Wallet Chrome Extension - Extension may have been corrupted error message
A Chrome extension release we pushed (version 1.2.20.1) had some issues on the Chrome webstore after the submission process and would disappear when clicked by the user and would not be usable.
The Chrome extension would have updated automatically to this version without input from the user.
WARNING: PLEASE DO NOT CLICK REPAIR OR TRY TO DELETE OR UNINSTALL/REINSTALL UNLESS YOU HAVE YOUR 12 WORD BACKUP PHRASE. If in doubt please Submit a support request to our support team and also check the notes at the bottom of this article.
Whenever the user would check their extensions list (by typing chrome://extensions in the address bar) the below would show for Jaxx:
We have updated the extension in the Chrome webstore and the update should be pushed to the user's browsers shortly. Once the update is downloaded, the Jaxx Wallet should be functional and previous information restored unless you have Repaired or re-installed the extension in the meantime.
If you are still seeing the above version number and error message in your chrome://extensions page you will need to force an update of the extensions by enabling the Developer Mode and clicking the Update extensions now button. at the top of the page:
If you deleted the extension and re-installed it, the issue experienced would have been the same until the update was pushed by our devs and reached your browser. When deleting an extension, the extension related information is cleared as well so the wallet would need to be paired with the 12 Word Backup Phrase to restore access.
If you clicked on Repair, a re-download process would have happened just as above, and a pair operation of the 12 Word Backup Phrase would be needed to restore access to the wallet.

I get your point about saving fees.. probably best though to just commit to a schedule of weekly buys and stick to it.  After all the users are paying the fees at a fixed rate.  My main concern is that the longer the delay from donating and making the buy the more likely people will get confused as the price of bitcoin can swing widely over a couple weeks..

Something to consider:  When applying for large loans (home mortgage for example) you not only have to provide bank statements, you have to explain where the money in your bank comes from.  Doing this recently I had to explain where a $3000+ deposit came from.  Failing to explain adequately nearly lost me the loan approval.    The gubment doesn't have to "do anything" big, they can just make it painful\harder to use, and sure, you COULD still use bitcoin, but in the face of adversity and added complications.. why would you?

You can get the 2x either way.   If you currently have the keys, and keep them through the x2 fork, then your set regardless of coinbases policy.  If you had them before yesterday, you ALSO currently have the bitcoin gold coins.  Coinbase supporting 2x will just make it easier for you (and me) to exchange your 2x coins for btc.

so strange.. I xfered 0.015 btc to gdax (no fee)
I withdrew 0.01 btc to bitcoin address on a different exchange (no fee)
So far so good, except the transaction hasn't got on the block chain yet (10 mins)
In gdax you dont see much info, some internal transfer id is all you get, and you cant search for that on the blockchain explore sites.. however, I check the coinbase account and I see that when I withdrew from gdax to the bitcoin address, the amount was transferred BACK into coinbase and "sent" from the coinbase account.. here you can get a searchable ID and sure enough the address is correct, still pending though..   So far seems to be NO FEE on this last step, which might explain why the transaction is taking longer than normal to get on the chain.  I wont know for certain until the transaction gets on the chain..

some ideas for your digging.. 
buying bitcoins on localbitcoin with store gift cards you bought for cash IRL
...for using btc anonymously look into "bitcoin tumbling"
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:01:09
no idea.. just checking.. Jaxx has a chrome extension..   you might have had a 12 word phrase.. did you write it down somewhere.. send to your self in email?  You should be able to restore your wallet with the 12 word phrase
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:56:13
I really like this question.. why wouldn't they ban it and why haven't they done so already?    It cant be because of "rational" thought, there is very little of that found in the halls of power??  Maybe its the very corrupt nature of the people in power who need easy method to launder their graft... no one wants to kill the golden goose when everyone is getting the eggs..

I've had carriers do full updates on my old phones when reactivating them after a year or so, but i could be mistaken.  The worry of an old phone is someone forgets that its a bitcoin wallet and then re purposes it, gives it to friend, donates it to women shelter charity or similar.. Dont old iPhones have to be activated in someway to even get at a WIFI only use?

Just for fun mind you.. 
First understand "I WANT TO BELIEVE" but failing to perceive REALITY when trying to improve reality will result in failure.  So lets get real!
 
Your being silly and assuming your world view is shared by EVERYONE in the world.. 


You certainly know SOME things about me.
  
* I can use a computer \ or smart phone
* I write good(ish) English
* I have access to the internet
 *Already that eliminates over 50% of the world population from being "like me"*
 *It is ONLY because we share the above commonalities that you call me "civilized..."* 
* I am somewhat "civilized"  
 *meaning that were having a discussion about an abstract idea using symbolic language based on a common framework of understanding.*  
You are operating on a preconceived notion that everyone regardless of culture shares fundamental wants and wishes... For example.. "everyone wants to be free to chose their marriage partner" .. which is demonstrably NOT true for some cultures.  
The "there is only one race" point is kinda dumb.  Race is NOT part of the scientific taxonomy associated with species and sub species.  Comparing apples and oranges if you will allow. 
Just so were on the same page:


It is irrational to assume that divergent populations, separated by 10,000 years of separate ecological specialization, with distinct DNA showing different evolutionary adaptations, would not have different morphology that you CANT see.. race is DEEPER than skin color.  You don't see many Mestizo Guatemalans in the US National Basketball Association, if everyone was the "same" then you should have a few short south Americans playin pro hoops.  


 *good luck with that.. the future were currently headed for starts with big ideas like were sharing and ends with the last big brain being smashed in with a rock.*  
 *EDITS for formatting..*

yes you can

no difference in storing $1 or $1,000,000.  It all about your desire for safety.    I'm mostly a noob myself, but id say a hardware based system is probably best for you.  You really need to do your own work, alternatively if your just too busy send the all the btc to "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" I think this address is totally legit, safe and secure and you can just send you $1k to that address where it will be kept under lock and key.  (If you don't see what I just did as an attempt to scam you of your BTC then you DEFINITELY need to do your home work, also it is NOT a valid address so even if you tried to send to it, it would fail, I'm not really trying to scam anyone)  
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:27:32
dang it.. I have an open order at about the same price point.. no joy on gdax! :-(  
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:57:57


Yeah, I see it.  So how is this not a loss for them?  Do they have their own mining pool and thus they are paying the fees to themselves? (is that even possible)  
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:22:33
Id worry that if you acidently stuck a sim card in it and\or activted the phone it would get factrory reset
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:08:44
withdraw \ send btc from gdax is free?  I thought it was only free to transfer between gdax and coinbase, not send to an external address.. Ill try this 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:13:13
I think for coinbase transactions its pretty clear, I guess they used to eat the fees for all transactions, but stopped paying for on chain transactions in March of 2017 (site:  )
From what I read, popular opinion is that "eating the fees" for GDAX is to stimulate adoption of the trading platform.  Those who know and use this to move out of coinbase to take advantage of forks might be costing them a pretty penny.  
  
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:18:58
if your stopping loss and really LOST initial investment cant you claim a capital LOSS.  A negative tax event?  
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:46:58
your BTC purchase was probably considered a cash withdraw and not a CC purchase.... different rates apply.  Seems typical cash withdraw rates are at least 2x purchase rates.  A 3x (300%) increase doesn't seem that far out of expectations..  stop paying the bank and become the bank!  
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:21:16
great article.  I'm curious about a couple things.  In the section **Tax advantages of selling specific lots** you mention selling specific "lots" to leverage the cost bias in the best way.  I would guess by a "lot" you mean a specific set of btc addresses??   How do you spend \ sell from a specific "lot" ??
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:59:55
so you have a typical user name that you use on the sites and probably a password system in your head..    have you checked browser history or are do you OPSEC?  (operational security like, incognito browser, tor, etc)
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:48:55
Coinbase is saying they will give you the post fork coins AS IF you had the keys.  You don't have keys for the coins you have on coinbase.  If you have the keys in your own wallet you will be able to access the post fork coins once some software can safely transact them.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:15:55
share with us how you managed.. might help someone else
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:07:35
do you have a backup of your phone data?  Does deleting an app ALSO delete the data files? 
do you have the original bitcoin app login info?
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:46:41
hmm.. interesting idea for sure. 
If your at all handy with a hack saw. you can buy an anodized sheet of aluminum and cut your own.. way cheaper.. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:38:28
I don't agree with this statement "Since it does not exist physically, it can’t be manipulated by anyone or anything"  how do you arrive at this?  Can you give a counter example, such as gold, because its physical, being manipulated by physical means?  To me bitcoin is information and CAN be manipulated in ways that any information can be manipulated.  The battles for fork dominance is a good example of exactly how btc can be manipulated using only information.  FUD etc.. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:53:34
this is a great gift idea.  Set up electrum wallets for your family members and send some bitcoin to it.  Scribe the 12 words on to the metal and wrap it up.  
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:36:57
yup.. hes right.. euros vs usd.. silly me
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:25:24
The price you did NOT sell at has no impact.. only the price you initially paid for it and how much you sold it for matter.   Its called "bias" i think.  The money you earned selling it MINUS the money you paid BUYING it.  With btc transactions the hard part is remembering how much you initially paid for the btc, considering that you may have a thousands addresses that all end up in one sell.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:57:47




ha.. you win the internet.  Everyone else got it wrong! 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:52:00
sometimes it takes a while.. particularly since you used gdax to send with 0 fees.  Doesn't giving 0 for fees sorta of put you at the back of the buss?  No nodes want to pick up your transaction for 0 frees, so you have to wait until somebody picks it up.. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:03:17
is it possible to have a friend in the US buy them and send them to your address?  
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:59:37
Replying to my own comment what a dork.. but.. 
When you send btc to a BTC address from GDAX it first goes back to coinbase. This happens instantly and you will see the "transferred from GDAX" entry in your account log right away.    You will also see  'sent' entry in your log as pending while the transaction is confirmed.   If you open this transaction in the coinbase log you will see 0.00000 fee was paid.  Is there somewhere else to look?   
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:49:22
thats just mean.. but funny
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:48:06
Did this last night.. not a big deal.. 
* Install Electrum
* Setup your wallet in electrum (part of first time install)
* click on the receive tab and copy the address
* login to coinbase, send $1 to the electrum wallet address
* wait a while to see the transaction is verified
* repeat with the rest of your BTC on coinbase
*  -------------  AFTER THE FORK
* Create NEW electrum wallet
* Send all the BTC in your electurm wallet to the new electrum wallet
* Find a BCC wallet
* Export the private keys from the now EMPTY old electrum wallet.
* import all your electrum BTC private keys into the new BCC wallet
* You now have access to your BCC coins
