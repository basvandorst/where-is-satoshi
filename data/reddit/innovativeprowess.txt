This kind of visibility isn't good for bitcoin though. I'm a huge proponent of bitcoin, but to the general public bitcoin will be portrayed in a bad light.

Oh cool. I see just another conspiracy theorist using arguments filled with hasty generalizations.

280 results to 673000 results
Around .04%. I'd say we're still in early adoption.
Edit: The count went up to 280 by the time I finished typing my message.

Trivial? I would use a different word.

More people are using Windows over Mac. 
Also, it doesn't matter if 


of people like it. What matters is who is winning the numbers game. An exception? More like a majority if you check the numbers.
Edit: Fixed the link of the stats to go to 2014.

But negligible is just a synonym. Its not in the context of a small quantity. Its in the context of it being unimportant, in which trivial does not fit well.
It would be like saying it's unimportant or of little importance to get the bitcoin out.

Only the intellectual elite can understand the true essence of the bitcoin.

Effortless or frictionless. Trivial means of little importance or negligible.

These "legitimate" discussions will NEVER occur. People like you are logically incapable of discussion because you have a natural yearning to "uncover" something that isn't hidden. Look at you, going on and on about the secret shadow government. On top of this, you even go as far to claim that the government is manipulating your posts! You think the government cares about the worthless bullshit you post on the internet? I'm sorry but you should really rethink how you view the internet as being so full of government spies.
