No one knows. I hope so though.

I may have to sell some since I'm buying a home later this year. I'd rather hold it though. I feel like real estate is the safest investment in the very long run. Home prices will never drop over a 20 year period so I feel that selling some BTC for land is excusable.

Today is the day. Next week should be interesting come Monday.

Looks like it. Maybe we can hold above 8k now. These dips are getting annoying. Some stability over 8k before a bigger rise would be nice

Cashing it in to buy land or a fucking car man. Shit comes up in the real world.
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:40:23
Everytime I read this shit the price drops haha

There's legitimate reasons out there dummy. Good luck buying a home, paying a big medical bill, or buying a car with BTC. Emergency and big purchases require Fiat and sometimes selling investments is the only way to get enough money to pay. People like you make supporters of Bitcoin seem like idiots.

Hold that shit you dummy

Based on what. I don't see a dip below 7500 but what are you basing your prediction on?

If Bitcoin becomes the preferred currency of the future what can be implemented to protect senior citizens and dumber consumers from being easily scammed. We have credit card charge backs and Banks protect debit cards from fraud. I know BTC gives more freedom but it also exposes those who are more vulnerable to financial fraud from getting back their BTC if it is stolen.

What do they provide as far as protection services?
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:00:39
Is a senile 70 year old a fool or could that be you in a few decades. Banks give charge backs and protect credit cards well. Part of the appeal is protecting the "fools." Arguments like yours bring no solution and will push support away from Bitcoin. A good payment system should be able to protect the vulnerable.

Strong argument. Some people here dismiss the fact that you need Fiat to buy certain foods and if you got too much tied in BTC you need to convert at times. Some users here are disconnected from reality, hence the metaphor.

Bad call imo. It will come back down but not before going up more and once 10k hits a bunch of new people hop in the game because of the news
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:30:52
Oh shit. It's really ��

One challenge for Bitcoin as the future of payments is protection of vulnerable consumers. Banks protect the elderly and other vulnerable parties from being taken advantage of through fraud. Bitcoin gives you more control over your money but losing it only requires a mental slip or good scammer to come along. People here say that if you're too stupid to handle your money then you don't deserve to have it but this won't realistically work. If these issues are being addressed I'd feel more comfortable with the future of BTC.

Why though? To buy something? I think pulling out right now is foolish to be honest. If we hit 10k there's no chance it goes down quickly from there. People will fomo buy like maniacs at that magic number.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:39:43
I fear them going after Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:22:52
End of month and price has shown good support above 7500. I think lots of people will be interested in buying in. Lots of announcements about retailers accepting BTC too and the 60 minutes special. Really just an optimistic guess.
