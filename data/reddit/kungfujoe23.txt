I sold btc at 3300 and eth at 240.  Set limit buys at 3010 and 201.  At rock bottom, my limit buy for btc went through (went as low as 2950)...but the absolute low for eth was 302.25.  I missed it by a buck twenty five.  By the time I woke up and checked, everything was rising back up...I panicked and bought back in at 260.  And now it's settled at 250.  lol...oh well.

Obviously it's relative to how much $125 is worth to you, but for that amount, I would just say to leave it as is...and just buy more.  But, I think it's going to drop further so maybe just keep a close eye on things and make a move when you feel it's gone down far enough.

For BTC and ETH I recommend Gemini. They are typically lower in market price and they allow pre credited USD deposits which allow you to lock in at the current price. You can even trade between BTC and ETH before your deposit clears. Can’t withdraw of course. 
They need to add LTC.

Ah...didn't know Gemini allows you to lock in the price of coin before your funds clear.  I signed up for Gemini so just waiting for verification currently.  
Regarding GDAX, from what I've read, you have to deposit USD into your account using GDAX (or Coinbase and then transferring over to GDAX) and that will take 4-5 business days and only then can you buy coin.  No way to lock in price if you don't already have funds on GDAX.  Is that correct?

Interested in this as well...I traded some eth for iota on bitfinex and noticed I have a tiny amount of eth leftover.

BTC will be shaky for at least a month or two.  Things in China are still uncertain and we don't know what's going to happen with segwit2x...I think there will be many more dips/buying opportunities to come.
