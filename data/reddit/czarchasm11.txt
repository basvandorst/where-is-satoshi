I see.  Then things are worse than I thought...  Oh well at least our BTC appreciated the last couple days. *hi-5*

Is there any way to gauge where I am in the queue?  Estimate how much longer this might take?  All the coins I was going to buy with it are soaring :(

I see, that is sad to hear.  Is there some way I can resend it that cancels the original transaction?  Could swear I remember reading about that.
Wasn't there supposed to be some group of miners that only focused on low satoshi transfers?

Any luck on yours yet?  I'm coming up on 5 days.

If you have full faith in it, I wish you WOULD explain to me why. I am willing to be convinced and would rather use one than a paper wallet for the convenience.  I just need sound logic and reason behind it before I take the leap.

So who is going to watchdog their software?

I ask because I'm a bleeding holder and genuinely want to be convinced TBH.  Thanks for the link, but I think it's missing the point.  Yes OG holders probably aren't going anywhere but you need NEW money pouring in at exponential rates for BTC to go up and the excitement for it out there is dying rapidly.  People are quick to move to whatever the best technology is, and BC has fallen far behind and seems to be continuing to do so.

How do you think I found out about the closed source software if you assume I didn't google anything? I didn't find a single response to it except "NDAs" and "I trust their dev team" and "any other software wallet can install backdoors too."  Clearly none of that is at all reassuring.

Why would they put their money into failing dinosaur crypto BTC when just about every other coin can be transferred faster and cheaper?  How long do you really think name recognition alone can carry something?

Alt-Gold does not exist?  Are you insane?  We put value on a great number of metals and stones.  Some far more than gold.
