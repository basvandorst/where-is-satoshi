Substitute “Brace” for  “Ass Lube” and this meme is equally true

I have no freaking idea man, I was just as shocked as you, my best guess is that the original tweet has some metadata associated with crypto so my bot picked it up and went along but I just made it smarter so it shouldn’t happen again (it also retweeted some suspicious Islamic text which I quickly deleted )
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:57:57
Absolutely, It even  retweeted about how XRP was superior to BTC, had to manually delete that shit quick lol

Actually better than half :)

Bitcoins or shot coins?? It matters :)

Hey what’s up, it builds an xg boost classifier every 10 minutes based on 5 days of tick level data and the creates a leave one out training set and tries to predict the class value (up or down) of the next observation ...it looks at blockchain data as well twitter activity in 10 min blocks (block time of btc)

Spot on , couldn’t have said it better..the goal is to open source it eventually.. I’m using an xgboost classifier with data coming from onchain, orderbooks, twitter activity and exchange trades....the Algo is never stored anywhere, the whole model is trained with the most available data every 10 minutes to predict the next observation... it’s not the most efficient approach but I’m storing the accuracy in table each time the approach changes..it’s just a fun project :)

Will build into it by the end of the week, the bot went haywire and started retweeting porn lol

It works better than random surprisingly, I’m the new Jerome Powell ????

So yea, my Algo can take more than the expected time, so if my, I rebuild the classifier every 10 minutes and it is never stored anywhere to make the incorporate the most recent available data in my training set  so it’s if the training takes longer than 2 minutes then it won’t post because the first 2 minutes is the max amount of time of a ten minute candle that I have to make a prediction...I’m working on the vis to improve, stay tuned

Gotcha, will do this weekend and update ya
