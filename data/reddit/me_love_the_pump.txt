Very weird. If i try to sell 3.2 bitcoin, i get the prompt to verify my information. but if i sell 3.18 bitcoin, it lets me?

So it's just helping the network stabilize and grow without reaping any net profits ?

Makes sense. What are the differences ? What is a node doing that makes people want one ?

Thank you for informing a fellow noob and not being the typical aggressive/mean redditor!

Saved me too. I wanted out so bad but I couldn't sell. I just had to say "fuck it. Let's ride it out"

Noob here. Don't flame me. What's the benefit of running on a pi3? Wouldn't something like a ant miner provide more bitcoin?

Just did a few minutes ago! looking forward to hearing back.

For something so prominent in this forum, i just figured it would be better. Sorry if i hurt someones feelings. Do you need to be hodled? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:51:28
So, I should buy more ?
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:51:03
Not new.. kinda... but I need it to go up lol
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:48:23
that's it? I'm not even impressed. I figured it was someones last name who invested something within the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:46:08

@_date: 2017-03-03 03:07:56
