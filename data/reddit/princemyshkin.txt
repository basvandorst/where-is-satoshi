That's my understanding. You control 2/3, coinbase has only one and an encrypted version of the 2nd. Any hacker would not be able to unencrypt that 2nd key so funds are safe.

What about a 0-day exploit in ECDSA? How would you mitigate against that?

I gotta pick on this as it's pretty egregious. The only actual scaling parameter we can adjust right now is the block size. Virtually all parties are agree 4mb blocks today would pose no technical issue and 8mb is very likely to be just as fine. So no, Bitcoin Cash would handle scaling in the short term much much much better than bitcoin. 
That's not what people are arguing, all parties agree. The debate is around long-term centralization effects of larger blocks.

Every exchange has gone down periodically. It doesn't mean they're nefarious, the best explanation is simply that they are struggling under the load of new users. 
Gemini went down a week ago for a bit, Coinbase has historically had issues periodically, Kraken is a complete shitshow, but I believe they've all publicly said it's due to intense traffic. That makes sense to me.

Price moved is a pretty meaningless statistic since all blockchains don't have fees that scale by value transferred. 
Agreed on batching though, except that Ethereum can also do batching but it's a little more convoluted and would require a contract. Also batching transactions in bitcoin will dramatically raise the fee and take more space in the block (tx size is much larger).
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:53:01
They're not on the same development roadmap as bitcoin. They have plans to move to proof of Stake and adopt sharding, which (if it works) means a node doesn't have to store the entire state, only a small piece. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:27:27

@_date: 2017-12-13 10:12:11
It's pretty clear what's going on. Some crypto service leaked their usernames, passwords, and the attackers are enumerating the data on other exchanges to see if they can get access.

If there are different recipients and amounts then it is not the transaction malleability issue. In that case, coinbase is doing something strange.

Mining is simply how bitcoins are introduced into the economy. It is akin to the federal reserve printing US dollars, which make their way into your wallet. If you are to then burn your wallet in a fiery death, what happens to the money? It is lost. Except in this case, the federal reserve cannot re-print it.

You need to understand that its got to be very difficult to be the interchange between reversible payment sources and irreversible payment sources, because a **single fraudulent order** would wipe out profits from *hundreds* of legitimate orders. There's significant risk there, and I think that shows in how conservative coinbase is in protecting against fraud. If they didn't have this stuff in place, I question if they'd be able to profitably do business. And this high risk anti-fraud stuff has to be in place 100% of the time, regardless of what the price does. 
And don't point to circle yet, we don't know how they plan to handle this issue, but their current solution seems to be to pre-vet accounts while they keep things in closed beta. I bet we'll see very similar stuff from them when they come out of closed beta.
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:02:47

Whatever fee circle wishes to implement is just rolled on top of their price algorithm. Petty slimy of them to turn around and claim they have "no fee" IMO. And in the past coinbase and circle have average out to the same price. Sometimes circle is a few cents cheaper, sometimes coinbase is. Competition here is good.

Your answer: Tin-foil hat denials of Andrea's credibility and demands for a full transparent accounting.

It's good on paper, but POS is largely untested to the magnitude that a multi million dollar company would be comfortable with.

Again, if you're not satisfied, ***don't use their service!*** It is really that hard of a concept? And FWIW, I don't keep my coins online at all, they are all safely kept in cold storage. But I don't have any qualms about using coinbase to purchase BTC, or blockchain.info as a hot wallet. Their security protocol seems acceptable to me.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:19:47
What are these superior options?

It's an option on most days, go to their webpage and you'll see it pop up.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:46:42


Yeah, that's where I take issue. I think Andrea's word means a bit more than just some random guy's claims. Coinbase demonstrated that have access to their cold wallets, and that the cold wallets currently contain 98.8% of coinbase funds. 
But this is all besides the point. If you're not happy with the options available to you, then **don't use them!** It's that simple. Keep your money on paper wallets, nobody cares what you do with your BTC. That's the beauty of it. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:57:52

If you know anything about quantum mechanics, then you know that *everything* can be expressed in terms of probability, since quantum mechanics is driven by it. In fact, it's "possible" to teleport. It doesn't violate any laws of physics. It's just exceedingly improbable. But just because something is "possible" on a probability scale does not make it realistically possible. The sort of orders of magnitude bitcoin addresses deal with are in the same realm as teleportation. So the true "possibility" of finding the private key to that vanity address is effectively 0. The odds are just too small.

Unfortunately 2^256 isn't the relevant number here. To crack ECDSA you only need one priv key to unlock an address, of which there are 2^156. Still astronomically large, but not at the extremes portrayed in your example.

They don't obfuscate it, take a look yourself. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:58:13
I think you're missing how this works. You buy coins on Coinbase --&gt; Sell on LBTC --&gt; do it enough times, and you have a high enough volume to be classified as an unregistered MSB. Coinbase would probably get in a hell of a lot of trouble if the government found out they were facilitating unregistered MSBs, so they have to restrict his account. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 23:43:27
What are you studying?

Why don't you use their multi-sig wallet? They can't lock those funds. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 00:49:32
Coinbase also has arguably the easiest to use multi-sig wallet out there. No KYC / AML fears there, considering you own the keys to withdrawal them at any time too. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:31:48
This is true. Case in point: everyone running around claiming circle is free.

That's ridiculous. Circle needs to get their shit together.
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:39:33
Yes, in fact you won't have access to your private keys at all. 
The solution is to use their multi-sig wallet. They can't steal your funds or seize your account. Best of both worlds!

Well, that escalated quickly.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:36:16
I believe there can be solutions. Obviously wire transfers or some other function of transmitting fiat will exist, but it's a big stretch to say it's impossible, especially since the bitcoin protocol natively allows multi-sig escrow transactions.

Agreed, I assumed this was the malleability issue since that is a know phenomenon today. But in this specific case, coinbase is doing something strange. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:33:12
I think we're going to see their price slightly rise, and you'll probably hear about cancelled transactions fairly frequently like with coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:15:05

I think that background check is required by FINCEN as part of any MSBs anti money-laundering and know your customer regulations. In other words, the US govt requires them to get that data. You'll have the same experience with circle or any other site. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:12:36
You'd have to be set up to sell quickly, so establish accounts at sung exchanges and be familiar with the fees, confirmation times, how long deposits take, and how trustworthy they are. 
For most people, grabbing a coinbase account easy and convenient, and well worth the 1% spread.

You are so wrong on this. A separate blockchain would be extremely susceptible to 51% attack, and would require a constant battle to keep it secure. There's ZERO chance any blockchain other than bitcoin will be used for distributing shares of a multi million dollar company. Instead, they will use something like counterparty that is secure by the bitcoin blockchain but does not use the same token (ie, bitcoins).

That's a bit of a misnomer, the wallets don't encrypt the keys themselves, they encrypt access to the keys. BIP 0038 encrypts the key itself, allowing the encrypted form to be publicly shared.

Just a quick clarification. A "big" computer isn't necessary here, and in fact these verification steps are performed by every node on the network when they first recieve the transaction. It's inherent to the protocol and performed by everyone.

2 of 3 ptsh address, and both parties pay into the address more than is required. They receive their extra money back if the transaction is successful. If not, an arbiter steps in for a fee.

You're close, but wrong. There are a few orders of magnitude more atoms than bitcoin addresses. But your overall point remains.
EDIT: I just crunched some numbers. There are 2^160 bitcoin addresses, which is around 10^48. By some estimates, the number of atoms on earth is on the order of 10^50, so it's a roughly comprable amount of bitcoin addresses. But the point remains, the number is so large that birthday collisions are near impossible.

The problem is that you would require earth to wait 30 min before officially accepting any transactions, unless you want to hold earth above mars and automatically cede priority to earth-based double spends. But this would greatly inconvenience Mars transactions, since you would effectively require every transaction to wait 30 min before confirming.

It's because of regulations. The stuff FINCEN imposes on MSBs is pretty ridiculous. I don't think coinbase cares at all if it's going to circle or wherever, but FINCEN does so their hands are tied.

It's not going to nothing. That's some hell of a knee-jerk drug talking right there. This issue doesn't even have anything to do with the bitcoin protocol or impact any of the previously known benefits bitcoin brings.

And as it turns out, the Electrum dictionary contains 1626 words. Choosing 12 words at random calculates out to be ~2^128 bits of entropy. 
To put this in perspective, that means there are 2^128 possible seeds for a deterministic wallet in Electrum. For comparison, the total number of bitcoin addresses is 2^160, and the number of atoms in the universe is 2^166 (~10^80). So there exists one bitcoin address per 64 atoms in the universe, and there exists one seed of Electrum wallets per 4.3 Billion bitcoin addresses.

"Mining" is simply the word we use for the process of gathering unconfirmed transactions and submitting them onto the official public ledger (the blockchain). We call it "mining" because in the process, 25 new bitcoins are rewarded to whoever finds a solution to a math problem (and is thus allowed to gather the transactions into a "block" and submit it onto the public record). This reward will decline by half until there are no more new bitcoins. From then out, the only reward miners will recieve will be the transaction fees from all the transactions he gathers into the new block.

Yermak's position is interesting, but I'm surprised to hear his criticisms. Those are well-known criticisms to be fair, but there are also good solutions to them.

@_date: 2014-02-26 08:09:09
Transaction not found just means the blockchain nodes have not received it or there is something internally wrong with their reporting. Turns out your transaction was safely waiting for confirmation all along. Nothing to be worried about. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:41:17
Public addresses are all that matter, there's no such thing as a private address. It just means multiple priv keys will map to the same address. So the number of priv keys is irrelevant, it's the number of addresses that matters. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:36:08
I'm very sorry to hear that, this is a bad situation for all involved. I think in the end, it will further emphasize the need to remind people of the first rule of bitcoin:
**If you are not the ONLY one with access to the private keys, you DO NOT own any bitcoin.** 
It's an expensive lesson today, for sure, and my heart goes out to you. Keep your head up, and if you do get back into the game, for the love of God heed the warnings and don't store your fortune on any exchanges.

"one of these things is not like the other"....

@_date: 2014-09-17 13:31:50

1) No, but it really doesn't matter. The attack itself has been blow SO FAR out of proportion over here it's boarderline fanatical. 
(i) If bitcoin ever gets that large, no bank or country would ever be able to amass the resources to obtain 51%. Period. 
(ii) Again, with what hashing power? You have to realize that obtaining 51% hashing power is an incredibly large financial investment that will only grow larger as bitcoin grows. Who's going to invest $1B in hashing power to undermine bitcoin and devalue it? Nobody.

But this is a red herring. The point is that, even if there were trillions, or even a trillion-trillion different potential vanity addresses, the overall privkey search space is still too large. It would still be realistically impossible to stumble onto one of them. Yes, there are *that many* possible privkeys.

It's a negligible difference if anything, and probably less reliable at this point too.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:56:24
The difference between the key and the bitcoins themselves are trivial. I'm not sure why you're missing my point on this, do you not see the circular self-affirmation here? You claim there is no risk of theft until something is stolen. This is true by its logical form, but says nothing of significance. My car also has no risk of being stolen until my car is stolen.

* Compromised Email (device verification)
* Another 2FA token (vault withdrawal)

* Avoiding cancellation during the withdrawal delay as texts and emails are sent to the account owner
What sort of credible scenario could result in all this?

I can't speak for why they handle cancelations the way they do, but I'll bet there's a reason that's not scummy. You think they want this sort of bad user experience? 
Look, it's got to be very difficult to be the interchange between reversible payment sources and irreversible payment sources, because a **single fraudulent order** would wipe out profits from *hundreds* of legitimate orders. There's significant risk there, and I think that shows in how conservative coinbase is in protecting against fraud. If they didn't have this stuff in place, I question if they'd be able to profitably do business. And this is high risk anti-fraud stuff has to be in place 100% of the time, regardless of what the price does. 
And don't point to circle yet, we don't know how they plan to handle this issue, but their current solution seems to be to pre-vet accounts while they keep things in closed beta. I'll bet we'll see very similar stuff from them when they come out of closed beta.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:06:51
I think most people are emotionally invested in seeing it fail primarily because they missed the boat on cheap BTC and are subconsciously trying to validate their earlier decisions.

Yes this it true, but it's a one-time shot for an attacker -- your device would need to be compromised when you're setting up the vault.

@_date: 2014-03-06 00:26:19
There needs to be an incentive for people to waste electricity and hardware on bitcoin mining. This incentive right now is the 25 bitcoins that are awarded with each new block, but when the reward goes to zero, the only incentive left for miners will be to collect the transaction fees. The free market will determine a fair price for the transaction fees. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:01:42
Coinbase has essentially [done just that](
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:03:58
There's no way they would publish that kind of data.
@_date: 2014-08-22 13:22:23
It looks like they're doing just fine even with the regulations. What possible reason would they have to shut down? Can you imagine that conversation? "OK, guys. We've built this great platform in this emerging space and secure 30M in VC funding, but these regulations are just killing my buzz, man. So I'm just going to close up shop. We gotta keep bitcoin free from those shit-eating regulators, man!" 
Yeah, right...
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:22:56


I really doubt they're doing this. There's a lot of hyperbole going on right now, and that sort of speculation is just that -- speculation. I'm sure there are some proprietary streams of information or something else they're doing that ends up linking an account to LBTC sales, or something else. They're smart enough to realize that after one or two addresses, you can't be sure the original person still controls the coins. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 13:30:43
Every wallet should have this functionality. And in fact it's very rare to see a 1-1 transaction. Most transactions have the change returned to a new address your wallet controls, or back to the sending address.
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:47:32
Either the original or the modified one will confirm. Which one confirms comes down to luck.

If you don't like it,  don't use coinbase.  But don't act like they're doing a huge disservice to anyone.  If coinbase went down, bitcoin would be in real trouble.  We need services that act as the intersection between fiat and btc, and that inherently means complying with AML / KYC.

Maybe they do? Or maybe there's legitimate reasons why they don't.
Either way, however they handle it, this anti-fraud stuff needs to be in place. They only make 1% on buys and sells, so any fraudulent order wipes out 99 other legit orders. Can you see how that might result in some false-positives, and (gasp) cancelations when the price rises?

Malicious nodes who are exploiting the transaction malleability issue are attempting to deny service by changing the transaction ID.

I think a lot of the rabble about Coinbase right now is speculation and hyperbole. We don't really know what they're doing, but some of the stuff people are claiming (like tracking your coins a few hops through the chain) just seem somewhat ridiculous to me. If you're actually concerned about Coinbase locking your account or losing your funds, you can use their multi-sig wallet and there's nothing they can do. 
That said, I personally like Electrum.

@_date: 2014-02-25 08:05:31
The "answer" miners solve is only related to publishing a block, which rewards them with 25 new coins. Miners then spend the coins, which make their way to your wallet. Once they are in the economy, it does not matter how they got there, and there is no way to recover or "re-mine" those coins. 
Think of it this way: The coins in your lost hard drive are not really lost. In the bitcoin economy, they are happily residing at your address. But in reality, since your hard drive was the only space that held the private keys, we know that those coins will never be spent again. Hence the term "lost."
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:18:08

@_date: 2014-03-01 02:42:19
Interesting idea, but it still doesn't work this way. First, the miner's don't see the "chain" of transactions where 1a-&gt;1b-&gt;1d would be more profitable. They only see 1b-&gt;1d, and 1a-&gt;1b. 
But even if I'm mistaken on that, miners cannot act in the manner you have described. This is because miners *do not forward double-spend transactions.* So really, there would be no way of propogating your 1b-&gt;1d transaction across the network, since 1a-&gt;1c already exists. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:09:24
I'm sorry you're having problems with GOX, but these issues have been well documented and are a big reason why the exchange rate is higher on mtgox.

Look at the definition of a [fallacy]( In this case, just because A (gov't endorsement of a currency) tends to lead to B (acceptance of currency), does not mean that the absence of A denies B. Bitcoin is on uncharted territory, there has been nothing like it before, and as a consequence it will not follow typical adoption patterns.

No, they really are separate products. The only thing in common is that both allow you to exchange fiat for bitcoin, but Coinbase is a [brokerage]( while GDAX / Gemini are [exchanges]( 
Exchanges offer lower fees across the board because they simply match makers to takers and are designed to facilitate professional trading. Brokerages on the other hand are aimed as causal investment or simple acquisition, and a commission is charged for the broker procuring the bitcoin. These differences can be seen through the simpler user interface Coinbase offers (aimed at easy UX), the ability to instantly buy via Credit Card, ACH purchases that are "locked in", more consumer friendly products like multi-sig and vault storage, and most importantly, an exchange rate that *is determined by Coinbase itself*, not by specific demand from other traders. 
So in my mind it's not a fair comparison between Coinbase and Gemini. Why not compare Coinbase's exchange product (GDAX) to Gemini so we're actually comparing apples to apples? 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:18:56
That's why coinbase exists, it's much easier. FWIW Gemini would be equally confusing then, it's the same as GDAX. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:25:17
That's clear confirmation bias. If a user's purchase gets canceled but it saves them money, they're less likely to complain. If the price goes up, then suddenly it's a huge injustice and there's claims about coinbase stealing money, blah blah blah. 
Look, it's got to be very difficult to be the interchange between reversible payment sources and irreversible payment sources, because a **single fraudulent order** would wipe out profits from *hundreds* of legitimate orders. There's significant risk there, and I think that shows in how conservative coinbase is in protecting against fraud. If they didn't have this stuff in place, I question if they'd be able to profitably do business. And this is high risk anti-fraud stuff has to be in place 100% of the time, regardless of what the price does.

So, is the government going to forbid all wire transfers just to stop bitcoin? What's to stop two people from sending a wire transfer for btc under the auspices of something else?

It's funny people keep making a comparison between Coinbase and Gemini. They are entirely separate products. 
Coinbase operates GDAX which is an exchange and has a largely identical fee structure to Gemini, so comparing Gemini and GDAX is much more appropriate.

Not necessarily. We just move to a quantum resistant cryptographic protocol. Just make sure you don't spend your coins before the switch is made. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:36:56
Well this pretty much shows that Coinbase isn't trying to screw anyone over. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:49:18
To compare apples to apples, GDAX and Gemini have the same fees. GDAX is a coinbase product, so your coinbase login will work there as well. 
Coinbase is a brokerage, GDAX and Gemini are exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:43:28
Yeah. Downside to exchanges is that you need to load USD first which means waiting for an ACH to clear (4-5 days). This is where Coinbase is convenient. You can get you bitcoin immediately with a Credit Card or buy with a bank account and lock in your price and the coins will be delivered when the ACH clears.
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:04:18
Agreed. Additionally, even if a party obtains more hashing capacity than all other miners combined, there's no chance they will risk their economic profit by degrading the foundation (and confidence) of bitcoin by messing with a few small transactions. No chance. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:37:14

Don't mind u/BTC_Forever (now Bitcoin-Yoda). He's a well known troll with some good intentions but unfortunately very misguided perception of reality. 
I think Coinbase multi-sig is actually the best option out there. Coinbase does not have control of your coins, but you still get the convenience of their wallet. It's also harder to completely lose access as you just need one of two things (encrypted key or vault password). Meanwhile obtaining access to one of those two things for an attacker is orders of magnitude higher than other options.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:50:30

Good point. Another reason why some sort of scaling solution needs to exist to avoid excessively large mem pools and long delays. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 07:50:54
I think your points are well intentioned, but also have some common misconceptions. 
1) Simpler user interface: It actually _is_ an entirely different type of product. One of the fundamental elements of an exchange is that you _can't_ know for _sure_ what price you will receive when you place a market order because the order books are updated very quickly and it will depend on the depth of the market at the exact moment you execute your order. This means they fundamentally _cannot_ tell you the exact price you will receive for an order, only an estimate. While this might seem like splitting hairs, it betrays the true difference between an exchange and a brokerage: One is intended for professional traders and the other is designed for casual investors. 
Simply put, a brokerage product can provide a better UI due to the fundamental difference between what it offers vs an exchange. I would challenge you to find a single exchange that offers the same easy UI as coinbase or (formerly) Circle. It's not because exchanges don't care about it (they clearly do), it's just that it's at odds with the fundamental element of their product. 
2) Instant buys are tangentially related to the differences between brokerages and exchanges. While exchanges can offer "instant funding", few do. And the target demographic for exchanges is not the same group of people looking to buy via credit card. Hence why Coinbase offers it, but Coinbase's exchange GDAX does not. 
4) As explained above, an exchange rate determined by the brokerage is not just an extra fee, it's a fundamental element to what a brokerage can offer. But yes, most of the difference in price is often a fee, but it's an appropriate fee for the service they provide. Circle had a similar fee, just baked entirely into their quoted price. 
5) Storage options are another product that is tangential to the differences between exchanges and brokerages. Exchanges are designed for trading, so it is assumed the user will be actively using and maintaining their funds, not locking them up for days in strong security offerings (which would defeat the ability to trade quickly when markets move in your advantage). 
In sum, they really are _fundamentally_ different products. People should compare Gemini to GDAX if they want cheaper prices. Coinbase is (unfortunately) the only major brokerage remaining so it really does not have a proper comparison anymore.

True, but Bitcoin also has a high risk of *catastrophic* theft, especially when you consider the use case for uneducated and unsophisticated users.

Remember with large balances you also need to trust the establishment and anyone at the company who may be able to gain access to funds.

There's just so much easy plausible deniability.

Yes, I think they should periodically provide pre-announced blockchain transactions on certain wallets that show they cover all account holdings. And I think that will come in time, to prove they are not running any fractional reserves. 
One company that is already doing that is Coinkite. And their security seems tin-foil hat, over the top, crazy secure. Although they also charge a per-month fee to hold your coins. 
In all honesty, the next and most logical step is to introduce some sort of insured bitcoin wallet service. People can feel comfortable using a service like that as a hot wallet, and continue to store the bulk of their coins in cold storage.

Why? If the price rose you would be demanding the coins at the rate when you bought. Now that the price is falling you want the opposite. You can't have it both ways, Coinbase is only giving you what you asked for initially.

@_date: 2017-01-31 05:21:09
On mobile so I can't give this a thorough response, but you have it part right, it's brute forcing a hash to find one that matches a set of restrictions. So in reality the actual computation is not hard at all, it's just a simple hash function. The hard part is finding one with a sufficiently small value. 
A hash function essentially turns data into a random strings. These random strings can be represented as hex values so you can perform comparisons on these values. The current requirement is akin to rolling a dice some absurdly large amount of times and getting a string of 100 sixes to start. Rolling a dice isn't hard. Getting a really unique string is. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:43:37

A few things on this debate. I've been in the crypto world for a long time and have quite a bit of experience with people losing their money due to hacks or lost private keys, etc. and I think a lot of people are missing the a key point. 
Frankly, unless you know exactly what you're doing AND you're aware of several possible physical attack vectors, the truth is most people are probably more likely to lose their money due to losing their private keys or their physical device (or other acts of God or theft) then they are to lose their funds due to their online account being hacked PROVIDED they know what they're doing. Let me explain.
The advantage to secure online platforms is that handling of the actual keys is kept to institutions who are very experienced in securely storing them. Yes, exchanges have been hacked, but for my money I do trust Coinbase. Their security team has been [far more open and transparent than others]( they've never been hacked AFAIK, and if they suffer a hack it's vastly far more likely to be from their hot wallet than their cold wallet, and their hot wallet is insured. 
This means the only aspect left to manage is access to your Coinbase account, but they have a Vault which securely locks your funds and cannot be moved without multiple levels of authentication and a 2-day wait while they spam you with details of the pending withdrawal.
So, for me, the question comes down to whether I think I'm more likely to mis-manage my physical keys, or have them stolen / lost due to acts of God or death or what have you, VS having my Coinbase account catastrophically hacked for 2+ days without me knowing about it, or Coinbase itself being compromised. 
To be honest, for $100k it's still a sort of tough call. But at this point, I would trust Coinbase and I think the rhetoric here against them is pretty much ridiculous. Perhaps look into diversifying how your funds are held to spread out the risk. 
Happy to talk more about this in detail if you'd like via PM. 
**EDIT:** Forgot to mention the best feature. Coinbase also developed a multi-sig Vault where you control 2 of the 3 keys. It's still easy enough to access them via your Coinbase account, but the key difference is that Coinbase actually does _not_ have access to your funds because you hold 2 of the 3 keys. So if they're hacked, your funds are still safe. [Read more about it here.](

If you have a coinbase account, try GDAX. You just log in with your coinbase info and it's possible to get Bitcoin at exactly the market rate by placing a limit order and waiting for it to get filled. 
Alternatively, you can skip the waiting and the hassle and place a market order but you'll pay 0.25℅ in fees. Which is roughly $2 on 1 BTC.

83 comments and nobody has mentioned the actual truth here. 
You likely received laundered money from some kind of illicit activity. A big part of money laundering is transferring dirty fiat money into BTC. These actors love decentralized P2P exchanges because everyone is clueless; they can't use centralized exchanges because those exchanges actually monitor for money laundering and illicit activity. 
It shocks me that everyone is screaming at the bank, they're actually the responsible actors here. If you're selling BTC far above market price on a P2P exchange, this is what you risk. Is it worth it?
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:53:12
Honestly there's probably a lot to lose. Accepting Bitcoin can be a real customer UX nightmare and there are non-negligible costs associated with support, education, and technical maintenance. As much as it sucks, the market right now probably can't overcome those costs. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:53:28
If coinbase cares this much about r/bitcoin, they would probably do a lot of things differently. Your theory doesn't hold a lot of water, isn't easier just to take them at face value that they're doing maintenance on the blog?

Yes, but this isn't the main reason. As soon as a new block is broadcast and it's verified by the master node, a new block header will be broadcast to miners that includes transactions. Empty blocks would only be from blocks that are concurrently mined within ~20 sec. 
Another reason is that empty blocks propagate through the network slightly faster, so your chance of an orphan goes down ever so slightly. In the end, that strategic decision might be EV+ because mining fees are still a small % of overall block reward.

@_date: 2017-11-18 05:39:17
Most of the negativity on here is only because people remember bad things but don't praise good things. 
Case in point, coinbase used to crash everytime the prices spiked (and I assume they received a ton of traffic in a small amount of time). That hasn't happened in a long time, something got better, but nobody is pointing that out. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:01:37
A lot of it is completely irrational and more of an emotional reaction than anything else. Bitcoin Cash is literally identical to Bitcoin, just with a higher block size limit to allow for increased on-chain scaling, and no segwit support.
If we want to get technical they also have a different mining difficulty adjustment algorithm (a good thing), and their development roadmap reflects a plan to allow for on-chain scaling as the network needs it. And contrary to what you may hear from here, it's not a giant conspiracy and they have talented developers who can build their vision.

The third condition is the most interesting. I can see a scenario where the price is lower after a hard fork confirms (several independent variables could affect price), whereas the economic incentives for miners to switch to the longest chain is more certain. 
is the third point meant to suggest that a mass exodus of people leaving bitcoin will not happen as a result of a "contentious" hard fork? It seems price could be one of the more sensible ways to measure this. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:57:34
Then the answer to his question is that there is none. 
And lol at "criminal fees". Coinbase offers a convenient product with instant CC purchases and easier UI. That's certainly worth some extra fee. You really can't call it criminal when they also offer GDAX for customers who want lower fees.

It's not that the wallet won't accept it, it's that the actual network won't accept it. It's literally impossible to send Bitcoin to invalid addresses, and it's exceedingly unlikely that any typos will result in a valid address.

Coinbase is fine. They're the largest exchange by far so you'll also hear the most complaints. As you've noticed, every exchange has complaints, and if they were as big as Coinbase they'd have the same reputation. 
Coinbase is heavily regulated and isn't shady at all, I'd feel perfectly fine staying with them. However Gemini is also a nice alternative but a little more complicated and verification takes awhile.

FUD. Coinbase said they're going to [give access to coins on both chains.](
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:41:52
And yet they're providing access to both chains and have not committed to any specific naming convention for each chain. Hard to see how they're being evil here. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:52:44
Except that they could take your (now orphaned) transaction and replay it on the new chain. That transaction is still valid. 
This is why only the attacker can make out with stolen funds, you need to double-spend the UTXOs inside the attacking chain. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:38:42
Be careful though, it's far easier to mismanage your own keys and lose all your money accidentally than it is for your coinbase account or coinbase itself to get hacked (provided you use a strong password and 2FA).
Honestly, I'd keep it in Coinbase unless you're 110% sure you know exactly what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:47:43


Coinbase has mentioned they will support both coins. Ergo they will provide access to them. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:19:22
You'd have to be watching very closely. All the orphaned transactions would probably go back in the mem pool of the large mining pools.
You would also have to continually be depositing and withdrawing from exchanges in perpetuity. That's a lot in tx fees.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:14:31
They specified you can [buy or sell both coins within 24 hours]( 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:56:02
Tx fees to miners would cost a lot, especially when everyone tries to taint their coins at the same time.

You'd have way more than $700k in eth. $1k would've bought you ~5000 eth, or ~$2m today.

You can wire money in and out, that's usually completed same day
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:58:26
And somehow the rise from $1k in January to $6k today is a "steady" price? Exchanges match sellers to buyers. If new coinbase users are buying, it will just be reflected in the demand on exchanges and the price will go up... Which is exactly what we've seen happen....

Good points, I think it's very important for an exchange to have a very paranoid security team and constantly be evaluating all possible attack surfaces. 
That said, there are also "black swan" events when you hold your own private keys. There is no magic security bullet, period.

Well you're always encouraged to maintain an encrypted backup of your keys, but you're still vulnerable to forgetting your password, losing your hard drive, or situations where they become unavailable. 
Overall I think storing in an exchange is least risk for most people unless you know damn well what you're doing. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:37:31
I disagree, there is not _every reason_ not to store funds on an exchange. The fact of the matter is, most people are more liable to lose their bitcoin from forgetting their password or their private keys than they are to lose them from an exchange being hacked.

Check out [Etherisc]( It's flight insurance on the ethereum blockchain through a smart contract. Because the smart contract will know what flights end up delayed, it will pay out immediately. 
It's the sort of thing decentralized smart contracts are going to initially disrupt. The upshot is that the margins can be incredibly thin because there are no barriers to entry, no friction with overhead or regulatory issues, and thus offers a competitive advantage to traditional insurance. It's also more user friendly, as payouts happen essentially immediately.

Easy to claim anyone has been hacked and covered it up, but Coinbase is one of the few ultra regulated exchanges, I highly doubt that could be covered up. No evidence of any hacks in 7 years of operation, that's a track record very few can claim.

Looks like it takes a few days to verify your bank account information. So this option doesn't work if I want coins *today*.

So you're worried someone might create a key pair that just happens to been identical to yours. Valid thought, that's entirely possible. Then again, it's also possible for your bank to be robbed and lose all your gold in the safe deposit box.
So what's really being asked here is, what's an acceptable level of risk? Nothing will ever be *perfect*. With respect to bitcoin, the number of possible key pairs is so astronomically high as to make it incredibly unlikely for your proposed scenario to happen. But before going further, I would challenge you to think of how many possible key pairs you think should exist in order to make the risk your talking about acceptable. Then we'll compare that number to how many actually could exist.

Has nobody heard of Augur or Gnosis in here? Is the censorship that prevalent?

If they can steal anyone's bitcoins, they will steal *everyone's* bitcoins. And they will do it all at once. It's already happened more times than I'd like to admit to various other online wallets. It is a real threat, and it's why people push so hard to encourage offline / cold storage. But hey, they're your coins, do as you wish. I took mine off blockchain as soon as possible, although I do keep a small amount on as a hot wallet.

You're still flat wrong and misguided about chess and computers. Cheese has not been solved and very likely never will.

They have an algorithm that determines risk on a case by case basis. Remember, coinbase does put themselves at risk anytime they sell BTC, so mechanisms that reduce that risk are necessary. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:29:52
There is no good comparison. All other currencies were backed by something tangible. Either the power of a government or gold traditionally. Bitcoin is in completely new territory, nothing ever like it before.

You own one key outright *and* the encrypted 2nd key, to which only you hold the password. Coinbase holds the 3rd key and the encrypted 2nd key, but they do not have your password to decrypt that 2nd key.

Is this a new thing? Just post your address?? This type of spam does not reflect well on bitcoin
@_date: 2013-10-21 01:45:38
Yeah I think your right, but semantics aside, even when you clarified your thoughts you were far off base. Care to clarify exactly what you meant with your comments again?
@_date: 2013-08-31 17:12:55
Thanks for the help everyone. I went with btcquick.com and payed some extra $$ in fees for the convenience of using Google wallet. Next week coinbase should verify my account and I'll switch to them. Pretty exciting to finally be vested in bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:24:10
Eek. Contact from coinbase ASAP. I hope you didn't get screwed. 
First of all, click on advanced details and see if you can find the transaction on the blockchain. If you can, then the coins were definitely sent to the address provided in blockchain. If you can't find it, then it's a glitch. 
My suspicion is that it is indeed a glitch of some sort, since the second transaction does not display the address the coins were sent to. I think Coinbase uses multiple address in some sort of rotation (hence why it important not to just send coins to one of the addresses "on file" at Coinbase), so perhaps the coins were sent to some in-house address for some reason. At least I hope so. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:00:56
However, even in this situation, wouldn't your client warn you if a detected double spend attack? Some nodes would receive both transactions and issue the warning. That would likely take &lt;1 min
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:12:59
You're at risk because the private keys are not stored locally. Rogue blockchain employees and skilled hackers create the possibility of obtaining your private keys without requiring your password or 2FA.

Whoa! Really??

It looks like there are not a lot of open trades at the moment. I think I'm going to stick with a more reputable source for now. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:51:01
You missed the point. If the employees were in on the scam, they have direct access to their infrastructure and could easily take the keys without any action from you or dealing with your passwords/encryption whatsoever. The private keys are not stored locally on your machine. They on blockchain's servers. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:23:16
If it ever competes on that level, it will force economies to evolve. And they will, that's not a bad thing. Change and evolution is inevitable.

Show them the two transactions in the blockchain. That's all the proof in the world right there. If they still won't acquiesce, then you know you're doing business with some lying douchebags. And if it's true that both transactions are recorded in the blockchain and the second was sent without any approval or consent from you, then I think Coinbase is liable and should refund the coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:31:34
Hi, welcome! Congrats on getting some BTC early in the game. You'll find a lot of great resources in the sidebar, which you should really read, as they contain answers to all your questions. 
The bitcoinity.org website defaults to the mtgox.com exchange rate, which is artifically high due to their limitations on withdrawing USD. The coinbase buy/sell price is set by their own algorithm, and is a more realistic value of what you can sell your btc for. Coinbase is great for buying / selling. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:04:07
Could you explain exactly why you should use a new address for each transaction? Where, exactly, is the risk in using one address for all transactions? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:41:55
I have a quick question for you that I didn't find in your FAQ. From what I understand about your services, you keep any private keys on a secure physical computer shielded from the internet and with various security measures to protect the integrity of the private key. In fact, you charge 1BTC for your customers to even obtain the actual private key storing their funds. 
This would cause a bit of unease for me. My chief concern would be the inability to take personal action to move my stash at a moments notice - I would have to rely on coinkite's action to move my funds. And this would cause a problem if, somehow or in some way, the physical computer storing these private keys is physically stolen. In that situation, the computer itself is gone, and coinkite would have no way of recovering the private keys, and thus clients are shit out of luck. Even if the thieves fail in obtaining the private keys for themselves, coinkite would also have no way of retrieving them and all my BTC would be effectively lost. 
Could you comment on this? Do I misunderstand something somewhere? Thanks.

Use localbitcoins or coinbase to buy some. Or offer a service in exchange for them. Or some benevolent stranger might help you out. +u/bitcontip 1 internet verify

I tried, but it takes a couple business days to verify your bank account. They deposit a few pennies and then withdraw it and such. Unfortunately, that can't be completed until after labor day, but oh well. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:51:14
Check the advanced details tab and see if you can find the transaction on the blockchain. That will give you definitive proof of whether or not the coins were actually spent.

No just requiring them to create their own wallet and transfer them there

You are correct, add long as you are defining difficulty as"length" or "number of blocks" in the blockchain.

It will be spendable after 1 confirmation
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:18:40
Ok, that makes sense. Unspent coins generated as rewards for mining a new block contain no signature, and are vulnerable to attack (sort of like re-mining the block, thus overwriting the old coinbase, and substituting the new one with a smaller reward to yourself). Thus, any miners who have not spent their rewards are at risk. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:00:55
Wait, they are random characters (generated from your head) and not English words? If so, that's damn near impossible to crack. Surely not worth $5.

Interesting. Could you explain this:

Faster block times are inherently more vulnerable to a 51% attack, and thus less secure. A 10 min average block time is a good trade-off between speed and security.
