They are delisting because they have literally no volume, everything's on CME futures. IMHO their futures don't affect prices, BitMEX futures does. Also, the current futures will stay up until their expiry --&gt; June 28th, 2019. By then, they will open BTC-backed futures.  
By looking at volume profiles, the 4k-to-5k range is empty (hear it: there is 0 resistance in case we surge there). My guess is that the recovery to 6k will be as violent as the November crash, if not even more violent. This is the perfect set-up for a world-class *squeeze*, baby

MimbleWimble, friend ! It's still at its infancy, but already useable on Mainnet. This allows you to remove the current Lightning channel hard limit, thus allowing you to open a channel of any size. Also, it's just a matter of protocol, but you could reload your channel in one go by sending your bitcoins to someone with a bigger channel, and that guys will send you the corresponding coins thereafter.  
It'd need some implementation and careful crafting with the existing BIPs, but nothing too complicated.  
By any means, Loop In is neither far-fetched nor impossible, given the right developers. :)

So to you, a \*private\* bank that runs a fractional reserve, effectively giving loans with money they don't have, don't print money ?   
Here's how it goes: the FED sets an arbitrary inflation %, which will be the inflation rate that countries tries to achieve. This inflation is there so that, over time, money looses purchasing power, thus creating an incentive to invest it instead of letting it sit on a banking account. This props up the economy *artificially* (even though it's not that bad to have a flourishing economy; never said so).  
Furthermore, this inflation rate is as low as possible, so that long-term investment is still profitable in some way. You see, if the inflation rate is very high, so does *loaning* rates, since the loaners don't want to loose purchasing power in the process.  
In order to do so, the States issues *states bonds.* They are basically promises that, if you give money to the issuer right now, they will give you everything back in a few years, plus dividends. Theses bonds are essentially a way for States to :   
1. cover their short-term deficits  
2. achieve the given inflation rate by issuing them in a certain amount.  
The Central bank of a given country thus has to liquidate a certain amount of theses bonds each year, so that they reach the inflation rate set by the IMF. However, since it's a hard task to find a buyer for each and every bond, the central bank *usually sells them to private banks,* who then sells it to you, the people. 
Well, not everyone, though. If you think about this, it means that the inflation rate only goes to the ones who have enough money to buy theses bonds. Bank job is mostly about buying theses bonds with the money in your bank account, and giving you the dividends years after years through fixed rates. The differentia is usually used to pay for services costs (the bankers, their offices and so on).  
Why don't we just buy theses bonds ourselves then? I don't know. Probably because the system enforces us to use banks and their credit cards, idk.  
In the end, almost every bonds are either bought up by very rich people and the banks.   
and we didn't even talked about the **fact** that theses banks use their then-acquired reputation to make it into a fractional reserve, by loaning the money that couldn't be used to buy bonds, to you, me, us, at **higher** rates than theses very State bonds because they have to at least cover up the Defaulting rate **and** their operational costs **and** purchasing-power-eroding inflation.  
To that, add also the "For-profit" narrative of *private* banks, and you end up with higher interest rates, because, y'know, profits.  
TL:DR: fuck yes they print money. A fuck-load.

QE *started* 10 years ago. And it's still ongoing. So, they have 4.5 trillion $ , and they use that to buyback their own bonds and toxic stocks.On the other side, the amount of hard cash circulating in people's hands is about 50 billion $.
So, basically, in 2008, when banks fucked up big time by trapping everyone in their mortgage spiral, instead of going bankrupt they basically said "fuck you, give us your money anyway, but since we already reaped everything from you we're going to dilute the remaining bucks in your wallet by 95%. (Fuck you)\^2".The only reason you didn't feel any inflation is because they actually keep this money out of circulation, and only use it as a Joker when gambling on stocks market. Stock goes down? Boom, stock goes up.
This system won't even let toxic companies sink by themselves, because "muh economy". Facebook won't sink, Youtube won't sink, Coca-cola won't sink because their bankster friends won't let this happen.  
Youtubers are being demonetized, Facebook sells your private datas, and at the same time they take days to delete the New-Zealand terror videos from their platform, let the Livestreams on. **and you get to watch ads for it**.

I really don't understand why all the fuzz about blocksize.   
For real: each and every year, memory storage price goes down about 20-30%. What *looks* like over-sized today will look like a joke in a decade. Just as a friendly reminder, in 66', a 30MB storage costed around 30k$ ==&gt; 1'000$/MB  
Fast-forward 50 years, we're down at 3 *cents* per *GB*.   
Yes, current blockchain is quite heavy for *today's* memory storage. By 2025, even if we increased blocksize ten-fold, it would *still* be 30% cheaper by then; we're talking about 50ish GB per year, you will never need a datacenter to store your node because computing storage will scale.  
Same goes for computing power, thus verifying transactions will take less and less time. This is a fight over linear scaling vs. exponential data &amp; computational processing, and the ones advocating for dampening the linear scaling are just ignorant IMHO

You're better off tossing a coin.
Kindly,a quant  
EDIT: Actually, let me give you a small insight.  
If you look at historical daily price returns, 80% of all the upside movement is concentrated in only 20% of daily returns (the top-20% of all daily gains). Furthermore, if you look inside each and every days inside that margin, 4 times out of 5 it doesn't retrace more than 20%.  
Basically, when you see anything over +6% withing a day, it's most likely here to stay. Conversely, selling there is usually the right play... Of course, it doesn't tell you anything about tomorrow.  
Not really something you can trade on, but something fun to know anyway
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:32:11
Technically...  
\*If\* you find a broker that allows you to short sell government bonds... then yes.  
Bonds are denominated in fixed amounts of currencies: you buy a 1, 2, 5, 10k$ bond, which is worth exactly that at expiry. Dividends, or "Yield" as they call it, is the continuous compounded return, annualized, of the discount you get;  
in other words, when you hear "10-years bond have a yield of 1%", it means that you can buy a redeem ticket for 10k$ at \~9053$.  
On the other way around, current negative yields means that you should be able to sell 10'000$ for more than that; -1% translates to 11'046$ at market price.  
You know it will always be worth 10k precisely in 10 years, so, as long as you can maintain a short sell until expiry, it works the same.... But here's the trick. If bond market "collapse", it doesn't mean bonds will be worthless; it will actually be the exact opposite.  
Right before ceasing to exist, bonds will be sold at market price for millions. It can only collapse upwards, as in "no one would buy that shit even for a million dollars".  
This is quite scary, because it that thing happens, all the short sellers will be pushed out of the market, forced to buy into it. In that regard, one would argue that you actually need to hoard as many bonds as possible, and dump it on the faces of squeezed pension funds and such.  
That's why capital risk managements are still buying theses bonds, even though they actually pay dividends for it.  
The dividend they are paying right now, in the form of negative yields, is actually the exact price point at which billionaires value their first-row seats to watch the economy explode upwards. Needless to say the next move they will do with all that squeeze money, is to "Spend that money well", as Donald Trump puts it.

As some people mentioned it, the problem is all about the implementation.   
In day-to-day life, your identity is merely a social construct: people recognize you as their friend, their family member, the guy that goes to a specific table in a bar; your name and surname, your ID number, they're all exogenous parameters, they actually don't define who you are; not really.  
Identity should have as many facets as there are people you interact with. Actually, you don't define your own identity, the people you interact with defines it. This is extremely challenging to build a system that can encompass all theses little details that, once added up, represents oneself. More recently, some researchers have been studying the concept of "Identity consensus through social interactions" and it is far from a stupid idea; the only challenge is that there is currently no viable way to implement it, let alone build a critical mass of users for it to work. And I'm not even talking about the fact that there's simply no ledger to built that; you either end up with some sort of sybil attack vulnerability and/or data tampering through double-spend kind of attacks, and/or outright censorship.  
We're decades away from such a system, and we've yet to see a ledger (which is privacy-friendly of course) that has enough throughput to do that, let alone the challenges of building it in a zero-knowledge-proof fashion.  
TL;DR: Your identity is defined by others, as there are no tamper-proof way to demonstrate by yourself who you are. Until now, we asked for Governments to pledge  our identities, but IMHO if there is a technology that can encompass all our social interactions, in order to come up with an "Identity consensus", it's Data Ledger Technology (a.k.a. "Blockchain")

Never go net* short;
Best strategy is to rebalance BTCs with fiats, with around 40% of the total value you’re willing to sink into it.
That way, you always have some funds to buy with when prices dips, and would always take some profits as prices rises.
I did some backtests starting to Q2 2016 up to right now (parameters: 60%BTC; 40% fiat; daily rebalancing if ratios deviate more than 61/39. Or 59/41; accounting for 0.1% taker fees; no more than 1 rebalance per day).
That portfolio resulted in 80ish% of an all-in BTC at ATH.
However, your maximum loss would’ve been -40% from ATH

What if I told you, you can always buy low sell high if you know how to invest. its called "rebalancing a portfolio"  
Let's say you have X $ to invest in crypto. Use only 50% of that to buy crypto; so you're with X/2 $'s worth of BTC and X/2 dollars. Some time passes; BTC went up (or down, we don't care) and you no longer have a 50/50 allocation of your funds.   
Simple example: you had 1 BTC worth 10k $ and 10k $ ; a few days later, BTC went to 8k $, and so your current allocation of funds is 44/56 %. You want it to get back to 50/50, so, you buy 1k$ of bitcoins and end up with 9k $ and 9k $'s worth of BTC, so, 1.125 BTC.  
BTC then goes back to 10k $ ; your 1.125 BTCs are now worth 11'250$ and you still have 9k$ on the side.  
Bring that back to 50/50 --&gt; 1.0125 BTC and 10125$ .   
Congratulations, you made 1.25% effortlessly without ever giving it a second thought.  
But it doesn't stop here: on most derivatives exchanges, funding rates are generally positive; which means you get fundings for selling. also, you have negative rebates for making orders. What I mean is that, by doing this thing on a crypto-derivative exchange, you can just place your orders (sells on the upside, buy on the downside, laddered at each %-move to keep your BTC/fiat ratio  get the negative fees AND get fundings.   
Fundings usually adds up over 100% interest rates per annum (the market is completely nuts), that'll make your fiat-part grow exponentially faster since you're effectively compounding all your gains.  
In a bull-run, you might end up with less BTC than you started with, but in a sideways/declining market, holy jeez that does the trick like a charm.   
If you're wondering what is the optimal % move after which you should "rebalance", it's tied to volatility; gains are exponentially smaller when you lower the %-move after which you rebalance, so you want to get the biggest possible moves before locking in profits. On the other side, tiny fluctuations greatly outnumber large ones (5 $ swings happens all the time, 50$ wicks, not so much). also, you get 0.075% of everything you trade back in your pocket (fee rebates), which is nice.  
I won't enter into the details but aiming for 0.2 - 0.5% moves works quite well, you see 10-$ moves every day, every minute and when prices starts jumping there can be 10's of swings in a single minute.  
You want a bot to do that for you. It's just posting make-orders so there's no risk doing it yourself, however you'll have a hard time catching everything.

Well, technically, considering your average sh1t weights around 1 courics (\~1.1kg based South Park's ep.9 s.11) and can be used as a fertilizer, we can approximate the price of a sh1t on a stick.  
Currently, a pound of urea-based fertilizer is around 0.40$, which means 1.1kg would cost around 1$.  
All in all, I'd buy a sh1t on a stick for a dollar.
