What I am referring to, is people investing money in what they do not understand. I may be wrong here, but before I do any type of investment I do some research on the company/stock/crypto/whatever it is you are investing in. 
The halving of every four years you have correct, this will happen every four years until 2140 when all of the 21m bitcoins are mined. All of these things are in the Bitcoin White Paper and more detailed info is widely available on the internet.  
I understand that not everyone is a tech nerd, but understanding the fundamentals of what you're investing in seems like a pretty good idea.
Study study study study study study.....

I gots to get in on this!!!! XD

I may be confused and correct me if Im wrong....Segwit(Segregated Witness) has nothing to do with the blocksize increase, that was the 2x part of SegWit2x.
Segwit makes each tx smaller by removing the public key from the tx after it has been confirmed, making the transaction smaller so more tx's could fit on the same 1mb block. 
The proposition was that SegWit gets implemented and after that the blocksize increase to 2mb.
Again....Please correct me if Im wrong?
Edit : Signed petition even though I don't use gdax or coinbase.

Thanks!! Seems I need to do some more learning!! Always keen for that!
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:21:31
Correct me if Im wrong, but a Segwit transaction can only be initiated from a segwit address(starting with 3). If you send btc from a non-segwit address the transaction will not be a segwit transaction.

The comment was meant to provoke, not even gonna deny that. A couple of my friends got pretty hurt during this correction, because they do not understand the basics of these things. Now Im not saying Im a know-it-all when it comes to these things, but education in this field is key BEFORE you make a move.
Everyone is making money in this space, that doesn't mean you should just blindly throw money at it. 
Yes....My portfolio is tiny, Im just a small time miner.

This is very interesting!!! I have a HAM license, but only for disaster scenarios. My dad is also VERY big into HAM radio, going to see them this weekend...will have a chat with him about this...

I just ordered 10 pi's...What do I do????
@_date: 2017-06-26 07:27:07
Well, they have softwares and stuff that runs on HAM radio signals, but it's not for financial gains....Like some people has mentioned, it's frowned upon by the community. But when shit hits the fan, it is possible to do it...illegally, but possible.
