A little clarification about the India situation is necessary here - they're not banning accounts, and certainly not individuals' accounts. They've started seeing major activity happening in the current accounts held by the exchanges (used for day-to-day trading) which is beginning to look "suspect" so they've asked for more collateral and scrutiny. Yes, it is a crackdown of sorts, and things don't bode well for the Indian bitcoin market (what a surprise - a socialist country trying to regulate a libertarian currency), but for the moment it isn't at the China / South Korea level. You're still free to trade at the exchanges. Naturally, there will be some individual accounts under scrutiny by tax officials, but that's just obvious when you see large amounts of money coming and going out of accounts of taxpayers that have otherwise declared a lower annual income.

What kind of FUD is this? 
There are 8 different BTC exchanges in India, and you can add money to your account through netbanking - no bank can stop that. 
If your bank doesn't allow that - it is seriously time to change your bank. 
And if you exchange doesn't allow you to transfer your BTC to an address of your choice - you're not using an exchange - you're being scammed.

India?? What crisis are they going through at the moment?

This is FUD. The claim is that the software patch would enable a new Aadhaar ID to be generated by bypassing the Agent's ID and biometric. Even if that were true, it would be pointless from a hacking point of view. 
You gain nothing by creating a new Aadhaar ID. Aadhaar holders aren't verified by the police. It's just a tagging number, like your SSN. 
Scenario 1: Someone applies this patch and generates a new Aadhaar number for themselves - they still need to add in their biometrics. Once they do - not sure what the point is. They're in a central database now with their biometrics. Further, authentication requires either your biometrics or an Indian mobile number. So... what exactly is the point of adding to the database?
FUD FUD FUD.

I find it highly unlikely that there was any manipulation. Doesn't make any sense. Let's assume that large exchange was manipulating the price with "fake" orders it would draw in real sellers. If those real sellers don't get an order match they will have to mark prices down. And if the orders are fake, it means real buyers aren't buying. So even if the price was high \- it wouldn't really impact anyone in any real way. Would it?
Sure there may some people that bought in at that price to be part of the bull run \- but how many, really? And they wouldn't be able to afford much since the price has been propped up \- they would have bought more if the price had only been "slightly" inflated. So it seems like propping the price up is self\-defeating. But happy to be corrected on this?

My absolutely non knowledgeable and talking through my hat take:
Theoretically, yes it can? But at SOME point \- it would have to sync with the wider network. If you had a big enough private network, you could probably get some transactions through.

no, not really. These Unocoin guys aren't the smartest tools in the shed. They advertised their machine as an ATM - which in India has specific legal meaning and associated regulation. So not only did they steal the credit for being the first (they were not the first - the first bitcoin machine was launched in Delhi back in April - as reported here on Reddit) but they also managed to become the first morons to get arrested for their machine as well. 
They thought they were being ultra clever by launching their machine with a public media blitz and claiming the credit for being the first. But Indian mainstream media is leftist, predatory and extortionist - and reported on the machine from that slant. Well the results are here to see. And thanks to their idiotic stunt, the machine in Delhi has shut down as well as collateral damage. Even though the machine in Delhi was under no threat (it was marketed as a bitcoin vending machine), it has now also disappeared, putting all of us HODLers in North India in a quandary. We were quietly going about our business, without making too much noise about it. 
One has to wonder how these Unocoin nitwits managed to get this far in business with such utter lack of awareness and sense.

You can verify that these documents are real at the relevant government website. That being said - still doesn't mean he's dead until you've seen DNA evidence.

I had the same shitty problem as well and went through the same process. At one point, somewhere - they ask you to verify your ID by uploading it (passport / DL, something like that. It was only after I did that that customer service finally got into gear and reset my account. 
Note to self - do not ever lose the goddam secret seed.

Not doing Proof of Key because my bitcoins are in the Coinbase Vault meaning will take a day for them to transfer and I only found out about proof of Keys today - the 3rd of Jan. So afraid not.

Well 2 private parties can do so - it would be considered "barter" which is not illegal, naturally. 
But to be used as form of _legal tender_ - i.e. that someone must accept payment in bitcoin by law - and that the government can use as a form of money - won't be allowed - and probably never will. The ability to print &amp; regulate currency is one of the reasons we have a government. Do you see any government relinquishing that control?

Send me your private key, and I'll show you. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:26:55
No there won't be. If you do exchange something for a cryptocurrency it will be considered barter as a cryptocurrency is not legal tender. So it's not a ban at all. Just a reiteration of their previous stance.
