I don't quite understand the comparision between market cap of bitcoin and Whatsapp. One is a company, the other is a currency.

I think we might be below $700 for awhile. I am skeptical of this sudden rise in price after being stagnant at $450 for so long.

To be fair, Mt.Gox may still be trying to get all the cash deposits figured out.  But I agree, the disappearing money can't be a good thing for Bitcoin or the foundation.

I guess if I was going to buy porn I wouldn't want it on my credit card statement either...

I would exercise caution before giving away your bitcoins to this company.  They might use your money for prototyping, and never make it to a final product.  There is a reason Kickstarter requires a working prototype before you can ask for money.

If I give you some gold I bought several years ago for a car, do I pay capital gains on that?

People tend to sell on bad news and buy on good news.  It works the same on with all securities generally.

Please don't link to Zeitgeist.  Even if their facts on this are correct, they are wrong a lot of the time.

While I am definitely a bitcoin fan, I don't know if investments into bitcoin are exactly safe.  I think maybe you could put a good amount into bitcoin, but remember, you should only put 10% maximum of your investments into one security (it seems thats how your viewing bitcoin).  For a 5% return, you can certainly find safer investments (ETFs and bonds often guarantee returns around there).

I am fairly sure the new rulings are just to assert that capital gains must be paid on bitcoin earnings, when converted back to USD, the same way selling another security works.  If you spend bitcoin for goods, I don't know if you have to pay capital gains taxes on it.

I think the primary currency used (American dollars right now) will always be the primary currency used for money laundering.  Using btc is inconvenient, and will be until bitcoin is the primary currency.  Also, the blockchain makes bitcoin even less anonymous than cash.

If a large stock trading company went under, would that be good news or bad news?  Only this has a larger effect because bitcoin has a small market cap.

Sure, bitcoin has the potential to go up a lot in value.  However, companies are valued by their ability to produce income and currency is valued by how many people accept it.  Therefore, comparing their value is difficult and misleading.

I think the more vendors start accepting bitcoin, more people will realize the advantage of bitcoin (especially with no fees).  So, short term, the price might go up.  However, where it gets interesting is long term.
When the currency you are using is increasing in value, you will spend less.  People do not want to spend a currency that is increasing in value.  Let's say bitcoin becomes the primary currency for most people.  Loans will be harder to come by, with higher interest rates, much like during the gold standard.  Innovation and large expenditures will be more difficult to finance because holding bitcoin is the lowest risk investment possible.  The inflation programmed into bitcoin might be insufficient, which could result in what you describe as deflationary currency.  So, the value of bitcoin might continue to go up, but with bad effects on the world economy.
Hopefully someone can tell me why I am wrong about the long term implications of widespread bitcoin adoption.

For 1 bitcoin, you will let me keep 9? I might be willing to help you.

Maybe put money in a safer long term investment, like some of the less volatile IRAs.  If he doesn't want to invest in bitcoin at $600, I wouldn't blame him.  Even people on this board are pretty bearish on bitcoin at its current price.

I apologize, what I meant was a prototype of the production model, which is what Kickstarter requires.  Either way, it looks like it could be really cool product if the execution is good.

Yeah, since they operated only on commission, they were always looking at slim margins, even without the problems that came up.

The same tax laws they would be subject to if they were using USD, in the United States.

If it wasn't, we would all be millionaires.
