Lawrence, came here to say what bitskeptic said. The UI is (at least in Android) very unresponsive and I really expect tip top quality when it comes to a wallet app. Otherwise, love where this is going. I'd also like to be able to create a transaction on my computer and sign it using my phone. Cheers!

Your sentiment is not completely unjustified, considering the IPO goals and perhaps the complexity. However, unfortunately you fail to understand or see the potential of a turing complete blockchain, and that there is alot of very real work going into this.

Its not often mentioned, but p2pool itself is susceptible to a 51% attack. If any one client of the pool controls more than 50% of the hashpower, they can control the rewards. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:02:53
Well, the logical next step is decentralised exchanges. Until then, you're going to have to trust centralised exchanges to hold your fiat and coins until you manually withdraw.

@_date: 2014-06-14 03:22:47
Don't have one, but if you read about how p2pool works, you'll see that it uses a Bitcoin (sort of) compatible blockchain with a 30 second interval to allow miners to accumulate shares. This blockchain is susceptible to 51% attacks just like the main one.
@_date: 2014-03-22 23:02:05
Right. Irreversible hash outputs are supposed to be indistinguishable from random numbers. So you should get the same result using any decent hash function.
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:23:13
Unfortunately it doesn't really help, as even if the asic were free, running a node still has an associated cost, and miners need the reward for that cost to be predictable, hence the existence of mining pools. Remove the need for (centralised) mining pools and you're getting somewhere. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:58:49
Maybe, it depends if and how the users take advantage of it. If they secure their withdrawal wallet separately from their login details, and it never becomes compromised, great. But over time there is a higher probability that their withdrawal address will become compromised, without them knowing, and thus there are other opportunities for theft that the user may not have been exposed to before.

Does this suggest that ghash/cex is experiencing some kind of boom/bust scenario?
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:01:18
Right, a "reputation farm". Google has the same problems with PageRank, and I'd wager that many of the methods it employs to detect blackhat SEO could also be used here. I suppose it should be the job of the client to calculate a reputation score based on feedback and graph analysis. Feels like such a system might be quite a ways off though.

This is an extremely dangerous situation. It removes the "trustless" aspect from Bitcoin entirely, without which it is no longer p2p at all.
* There would be no profit motive for anyone else to hold a copy of the blockchain or participate in mining
* Over time the hashpower of the rest of the network would diminish to the point of insignificance
* The BMM would then be able to rewrite the entire blockchain as he saw fit.
* Or, eventually hashpower would diminish to a point that a competitor threatened to tip the balance, and the BMM would be forced to corrupt the protocol to maintain control.
Power corrupts. The BMM would eventually be corrupted when something threatened his monopoly. Or indeed, he could be bribed or threatened by a government or industry. A BMM would eventually have the power to change the protocol of Bitcoin so that he could rewrite the balances, yes, even steal money, bypassing cryptographic ownership altogether.

I think that people mistakenly assume that bitcoin will make banks obsolete... It won't, banks will coexist. And the potential for bitcoin to change politics is so far off they don't even see it right now.

Very nice post. I've done the same thing sending money to Argentina, where you can sell bitcoin for the free market dollar rate, rather than the government dollar rate which sucks. But your post enlightened me to the possibility that bitcoin remittences may be further fuelled by demand for bitcoin in developing nations with weak local currencies (where demand for bitcoin is higher; the remitter would be simultaneously taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity).
@_date: 2014-06-21 02:52:47
Would also give them the power to perform a 51% attack on p2pool. But of course nobody cares about that, they're on our side ;). 
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:10:10
What do you think of the tree chains idea? It looks like it has potential to mitigate the need for mining pools.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:54:50
Good point 
@_date: 2014-06-13 12:05:48
Well put.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:49:35
I didn't know about checkpointing, good to know. So you're right, they wouldn't be able to rewrite the blockchain. I know that Gavin blogged about a possible 51% mitigation that entailed prioritising blocks with the most BDD, which sounds quite sensible. I don't know what other protections the official client might have in place. But, the attack I have in mind is something like the following:
Once a BMM has established him/herself as the only significant mining force on the network, they can take siege of the network by forcing the users to accept a protocol update, perhaps under the guise of introducing a greenlisted network, to prevent terrorism or whatever. If users refuse, they don't get their transactions included. Yes, there are rules that other clients can put in place to try to mitigate central control (like Gavin's idea), but you can't ever kick them off the network, so it amounts to a game of cat and mouse. Stupid example, a bad actor with a huge majority hashpower could withhold transactions incrementally, until all or most transactions have to wait 3 blocks for inclusion. Each time the protocol undergoes an update to mitigate their attack strategy, they drop it and prepare another attack. Would anyone do this? I don't know... Under certain circumstances they might try something.
_Any_ organisation that has a resource that the users can't do without (lets imagine a fictional company that controls all the water) can force such a change. Majority hashpower is such a resource.
@_date: 2014-06-04 11:19:59
1) how does the current method handle it? 2) why weaker? There may be a mathematical answer but I don't get it. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:39:02
You're assuming that all actors are perfectly rational and prepared, that transaction fees will eventually be enough to secure the network (different issue I guess but still), and that the algorithm must surely work as long as it's open for everyone to read. None of which are necessarily the case.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:23:35
So he decided that block reward halving was the lesser of the 2 evils. Easily my favourite answer. Even if it's not the whole picture, it appeals to me as a programmer, because I know that sometimes you have to make tough decisions for simplicity's sake.
Additionally, if this is the reason that the block reward doesn't decrease gradually, it might indicate the presence of an interesting mathematical problem, ie, how to find a nice logarithmic curve that always yields integers and doesn't require any FP operations.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:25:31
I think people are just frustrated at not having more sources of information with which to make a decision.

2) Still applies

Any reference showing that banks take part in annual war games?
There's a chance that if this happened they'd try to blame it on the Indians again, which might work once or twice. But once that excuse wore thin they'd be in serious shit, as it would be much harder to convince everyone that'd they'd recovered from a malicious attack than a software bug.

@_date: 2014-05-24 12:13:26
That would be an extremely fun outcome. But bitcoin runs on self interest. Its every bit as likely that satoshi created bitcoin because he knew that the early mining opportunity would make him considerable wealth, and that he's not spending it now because he doesn't need to. If I were satoshi, I'd be thinking primarily of my family's future... What happens when the earth runs out of food / water etc. Charity war chest for protecting bitcoin is fine as long as it makes financial sense, ie, it becomes more personally expensive to do nothing.

The whole point of bitcoin re timestamping appears to fly completely over his head:


For solutions which would prevent various bitcoin web servers from manip- ulating these time stamps we will need to propose additional mechanisms, such as secure bitstamps or additional distributed consensus mechanisms. We will develop these questions in another paper.

In the same way as blockchain.info is a closed source service which allows users to participate in an open source and publicly accessible network.
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:20:38
The algorithms don't have to be / shouldn't be open. The network can have clients that service thousands of users ala blockchain.info. They should be in a position to charge commission fees. It's better than eBay since no-one owns the network. The network needs to implement the market and feedback database. Reputation scoring is complex work which should be constantly iterated upon, and will be an endless game of cat and mouse, as is PageRank.

@_date: 2014-06-09 19:56:19
Oh, you mean why is this not going to happen. Well, there are some ideas about mitigating large mining pools, but basically I don't know. Hashpower is hashpower, there's no reason to have multiple giants around like there is in say mobile phones or clothing manufacturers. These companies are limited by the complexity of what they're trying to do and also consumer preference. I fear that hashpower is essentially not as difficult to scale.
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:11:00
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:48:03
You think so? Probably some banks have good procedures in place and would be able to recover quickly from a malicious alteration of the ledger, but I bet that many more have much less well tested recovery procedures and confidence in those banks would be enormously hurt by a large scale attack.

We hope it will. We've got 1/10th of an exa hash that depend on 25btc every block. Who knows what'll happen in 2016? Predictable or not, not every miner will be prepared and some previously profitable hardware will no longer be profitable. A sudden change could leave the network vulnerable.

Right, reward halving is fixed and independent of difficulty. As the reward goes down so does the supply, so in theory it may increase the price of bitcoin because miners are selling less, but i doubt it'll increase by a factor of 2. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 16:30:50
Right, essentially, I'd like to have a bitcoin:// link handler on my desktop, and it'd be nice to be able to receive payments and integrate with Facebook and all that nice stuff, but I don't really want to authenticate my desktop at any point, because:
* One trusted device is enough
* Phone has better security due to application sandboxing
* Phone goes wherever I go, desktop doesn't
This is assuming that I need the desktop software at all - I'll continue to use my phone for the security reasons mentioned above but I don't know what kinds of integrations Bitcoin wallet software will make in the future.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:19:39

Probably because they realise they can't kill it. And it represents significant business interests. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:34:58
This is good speculation. But what about the fact that they never actually mentioned Bitcoin at all? They don't even utter the words "cryptocurrency". Just something vague about an approved virtual currencies list, no indication of what might be on it or why or when.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:06:33
My math isn't great... I see the fractions are involved in decrementing the binary numbers but I don't see the significance of the fractions or how it results in a curve.
Another way occurred to me, which is to take a starting reward n and yield it (n-i) times, ie, starting at 5:
This gives a pretty nice curve I think. Could be tweaked a bit perhaps.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:13:03
Doesn't mean that the next one will. And if it doesn't, it's going to leave alot of unprofitable hardware in the network.

And how do you propose that the Bitcoin protocol achieve this? By introducing logic to favour some distinct political ideals? Bitcoin is a ledger, the protocol itself is apolitical. That's the whole point. The political take is the _current_ system. Where accounts can be blacklisted and everyone is forced to provide visibility of their transactions, or even simply denied the freedom to convert their money. You must choose between politics and financial privacy.
