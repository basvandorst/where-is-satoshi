A couple months before my grandfather died which was recent I think about a year now. He was asking me if I ever heard about bitcoin, he was fascinated about it. 
Anyways a tip of mine is if you discover gold, and can make more gold. Are you going to tell more people about your gold? Let friends and family discover Bitcoin and you not look stupid if something happens.

Wow, lol any tech company is eventually due to get hacked. Nothing in life is guaranteed - if someone says that, RUN.

Localbitcoins is one of the only sites that hasn't screwed over the community. They can run for president and I'll vote for them at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:35:19
Why is it every time we seem to hit a peak in Bitcoin price there is some sort of hack or stolen bitcoins?

I would never tell my family or friends to invest. Been in the game since ‘11-‘12. Last thing I need is a crash caused by hackers involving exchanges (the higher the price the more attractive bitcoin looks). Then having friends and family members hate me . That’s just my opinion though. If it hits 20k I think he should cash out and wait a month or two.

How do you know OP device was hacked? Speculation? 
I mean there is no way there could be a vulnerability on localbitcoins... Right...
Everything here is speculation but what is the truth is either OP phone tokens were hacked and there was enough info to bypass 2fa and the hacker had OP email access ... Or localbitcoins has a vulnerability ... Which seems more likely?
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:38:30
Dip in progress 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:32:59
Yes me to, I seem to be the only guy in my group to think this also 
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:41:52
What should they do? Lol they should do something. LocalBitcoins says that 2fa and login guard protects you 99% of the time. 
If they are willing to dish out stats like that they should be willing to insure your bitcoins will be safe on their server. 
Explain to me how they will allow an IP address from across the globe access to withdraw funds. 
Would a centralized bank allow this?
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:21:33
LocalBitcoins support is a joke
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:45:19
I think so
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:22:13
I'm a pro trader on there. And OP is a real life friend of mine. I am telling you it's localbitcoins... 
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:13:40
I don't want to have this argument on my iPhone. OP and I have used the same computer and wifi.

Open an account with them and make a buy for 1 btc you will see the true mark up. The live orders is deceiving 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:18:10
Lol you don't use bitcoin more than oil. I bet 90% of what you do on a daily basis involves some sort of function regarding oil.

Popcorn is out
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:27:03
So risky why wouldn't you just buy 50k in oil? Something physical seems safer. Don't get me wrong keep buying bitcoin I'm a activist of the technology.
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:56:03
I am not saying anything bad about bitcoin , but come on when someone says something about oil not being apart of their lives ... Now that's just naive.

I'm a trader also and I don't agree. Losing 10-15% over night affects my margin of sales (5%) above spot.

I like copay for hot wallets. Also I think local bitcoins is the best bet for secure services and fast bitcoin releases. They have an escrow system and you can buy online or through a local trader in your area that you can meet at a Starbucks etc

Lol I graduated college in 2012 I was supposed to go to pharmacy school. I told my parents I wanted to pursue bitcoin. I created an otc desk, then led to bitcoin atms. I was the black sheep in my family from 2012 to 2016, now I’m not.

Bitcoin is a community, personally I like meeting someone to buy coins usually at about market price maybe +1% . It's less expensive and you get the coins then. You can even do a cash deposit trade online that is secured with escrow so buyer and seller are protected.
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:45:37
No this is an indication it will drop lol

I’ve been on lbtc for almost 6 years. The past 3 years on my ad I just have my cell listed and that’s how I buy and sell crypto. Meet at a bank 90% of the time. Bank knows my business model, and everything works perfectly. I have even created content for first time buyers to read before a meet up. Also I do agree somewhat with only one person not two. However I understand bringing a friend will make them “feel” better and that’s just fine. 
I’ve never been robbed while at a bank . I used to do cafes but I learned being at a bank the customer almost never asks any questions and it’s a pretty fast process. My big flag would be, the phone number reverse check and also I put their names through ofac or a kyc pre screen. All I need is their cell phone and first name to do my checks. 
I’ve been doing this for years, it’s how I make a living. On my taxes I report it as capital gains so I pay small fees compared to other people, less than 20% and I’m ok with it. I could write a fucking book on this stuff lol

*let me correct; " prevents the possibly of customers having to be worried about their bitcoins being associated with black mart or illegal history of the coins.

UTXO.us 
Sells mined Bitcoin that has no Bitcoin address associated to other than the companies wallet. So it prevents the possibility of being worried about their coins being tied to bad Bitcoin address that may have been used in black market type sites.

That's the biggest reason, also since price has gone up substantially. New investors have come to me and I help them secure a good hot wallet and consul them on cold wallets. Also give them a little insight on future possibilities that will affect price like the segwit activation in the coming weeks. They really enjoy speaking to me over coffee, I'm their "bitcoin guy" that's literally what they call me. I love my job. It's been paying my bills for 7 years including my recent wedding. :)

Um no I actually own a OTC bitcoin trading company. I've been doing OTC trading for going on 7 years now. My clients are well established . I only sell 10k plus and registered on FinCen as a money transmitter. I charge 3.5% mark up from GDAX price and clients get their coin instantly. 
Everyone I deal with I run KYC on them so I know exactly who they are. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:37:28
Name of the POS system?
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:51:54
I'm registered with FinCen , I have to file CTRs on all transactions above 10k. They go through me because they have had trouble going through exchanges and sending domestic wires to exchanges and their accounts being shut down because of buying bitcoin. Also when they send money to coinbase for example they have to wait a day or two to get the money, and the volatility could affect them negatively . 
People just prefer face to face transactions with no wait time. I suppose there is a convinces for the small fee.
