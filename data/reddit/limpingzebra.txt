Thank you! ��

There are numerous systems that allow you to transfer funds into BtC from credit cards or other means. Check out Payeer.com for example. 
If nothing of the sort works, you will have to resort to visiting LocalBitcoins.com or even Ebay.com - if you input « bitcoin » into the search it will give you a list of sellers but the prices aren’t that great since it’s not in Sync with the exchanges..

It’s in a way a mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy, in a similar way that ICO’s are. Who will come up with new black chain technologies if not passionate people who got billions of dollars thrown at them by investors? Sure, many of them will fail, but the sheer amount of money around in the crypto space is what drives its evolution. 
The pants that get watered are the ones that grow, so if you have a lot of funding being pumped into any given field of work, a lot of talented and able people start to gravitate towards the sector, helping solve problems and find improvements. 
If you go back and read articles from 2012-2015 you will see a lot of the same type of skepticism you are exhibiting right now, and whereas you may be partially correct in your thought process, your fears will eased the more you learn about the inner workings of the technology itself. 
All speculation aside, Bitcoin also happens to be one of the biggest brands in the world, and had it been proprietary it would cost billions just for the name and logo alone, so even if some black swan event was to wipe out the current coin, the community and core would figure out a way to bring it back and not allow for the termination of the chain to occur.. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:07:16
It’s funny how people talk about death spirals when barely 3 months ago you could buy BTC between 2 and 3k usd. If it’s worth that much in the state that it’s in, any improvements by the Core will only drive the price up again...
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:29:25
Thank you for your reply. It is nevertheless surprising that such a colossal volume of BTC that is willing and available to trade is now sitting on the sidelines. Makes you think what would happen in 1% of it decided to trade again...
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:31:15
Read up about the difficulty adjustments, they will take care of it. The only thing that could threaten it is if the price drops significantly, at which point miners will be forced to partially move to other coins, but I am sure between the people who are committed having purchased Asic miners, enthusiasts who will want to support the network, and those who will continue mining even if it is not profitable because they believe price will increase in the future, BTC will never be abandoned by miners, unless it is a coordinated move with the Core dev team, ie suicide  
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:07:19
Very nice! I don’t see the code though...
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:51:25
Haha yes I supposed I could. If you would like to see more check out r/immersion_cooling
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:11:42
Correct, the setup runs at 40 degrees. The liquid we use serves as a lubricant so the fans are good for now, but we tried to preserve the miners in stick form. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:15
Haha yes I saw it was very flattering ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:52:51
Yes, the PSU is also submerged next to the miners 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:47:04
I will post more video/ and FAQ as people have a lot of questions ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:33:35
We can partner up if you have some radically new ideas on how to improve hardware performance ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:33:45
Yes, these are the gurus of immersion, we look up to their work very much. However they use two-phase 3M liquids that are vastly more expensive, and they do no make their products available to the public, nor are they compatible with standard Antminers. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:09:03
It’s not that much more expensive than a quality air cooled set up for 36 Antminers, when you factor in the fact that you are using 10 times less space, providing free heating, generating almost no noise or heat and can overclock the machines, it makes for a good value proposition. As a bonus it looks cooler than a conventional Miner-on-shelf  setup 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:46:36
The water doesn’t need to boil, we are able to
Use 50c water for heating and showers etc 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:40:03
Thank you for the motivation ��
We are working on a 2.0 version will have a lot of the elements you describe incorporate into it. 
Cooling it without running the tap water is what we just finished doing, we cycled the water through a cooling tower thereby minimizing waster by 99.99% 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:13
Thank you! It’s a proprietary fluid, by mineral
Oil can be used as a substitute. total power consumption is 50kw out of which only 500w is the vat, rest is the machines inside it. I am looking into putting together an FAQ ����
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:24
Come join r/immersion_cooling if you want to keep up on the progress ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:20
Thank you for your feedback! Out setup helps decrease Capex, not install permanent ventilation system into the building, need a lot less space to deploy, allows for stable 10% overclocking and is able to provide heating and hot water for multiple houses. 
And you do get the cool looks as a bonus ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:13:36
Yes there is just a humming sound form the pump. The noise in the video is from a server running next to it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:54:54
Yes, all you hear is the noise from the pump, but it is very quiet in comparison 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:43:25
Around 20k 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:56:26
We don’t have a pool unfortunately, but if we did we would definitely do it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:49:12
Thanks! Get it? As in..?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:24:49
So far we use it to heat the surrounding building 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:31:56
Haha thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:49:30
Working on it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:23:36
Today is not the bet day to do ROI calculations but we are aiming for 1 year 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:45:31
Right now they are mining some hardcore shitcoins ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:44:50
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:00
The power input is 50kw so they should be about equal 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:35:45
It a hybrid we have made using some additives but basically yes 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:41:54
It ended up being a little expensive because we were learning in the process, however considering it holds in itself the Ethernet hub, full switch box, pilots and monitoring system, you would hardly be able to bring the costs under 10k without mass producing it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:42:57
Thank you! I will post some more soon! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:05:02
The vat comes with a heat exchanger and all
The electrics as well as the Ethernet hub for all 36 miners and all wiring. Working temp on an S9 is between 40-50c depending how much water you run through the heat exchanger 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:58:09
That’s is true, however these are all
Issues that can be tackled and resolved. It took us a long time to find the best suited liquid, and we are still looking for that ultimate price/quality ratio. The deposits/dust get filtered out by a filter placed before the pump intake, and the miners have been immersed since last summer and show no signs of having any issues 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:29:09
Well, that is just for the vat, not including the miners themselves..
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:46:08
Good question - we have struggled with that issue for a while, and needed up finding the right spec that evaporates so slowly that it would virtually take forever for it to be noticeable, and it does not absorb moisture so conductivity will not be a problem in the next few years. It becomes cheaper the more you scale it, as of 3 units the math becomes very attractive 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:28:37
A bit of both, we also mine some random coins like Magnet and other obscure stuff. Always experimenting 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:34:12
That is a philosophical question at this point, I am doing it because I like it and believe in the digital economy 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:04
Thank you for your feedback! With our liquid there is no worry of metallic leaching as it was tailored for this specific task. We had some miners running since last summer and have had no issues. I am sure the volume of liquid has something to do with it, however it is mostly its innate properties that allow this to function the way it does. I couldn’t make a public post revealing the details on the liquid but you can achieve similar results using mineral oil 
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:04:38
You are right, however we are using different number you and I. Your mate ordered it in the summer when the pre-order price for a Bitmain S9 was around 1200$, whereas now they are about 3k with a PSU and shipping/customs costs, so getting the miners alone for a 40ft model would cost $1.3m
I believe it is more fair to compare the cost of the installation alone, and not mix it with the costs of miners, as it varies greatly depending on BTC price and availability.
 1 40ft = 432 S9 that’s exactly 12 vats of 36 Units each. 
Cost of 40ft GR Cooling container: $570,000 
Cost of 12 vats: (20 x 12) $240,000
Then you have shipping and installation costs, which will probably be comparable. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:14:47
Haha thank you it gives me a nice feeling looking at it as well. It is less captivating on video, when you see it live it looks like a Stargate. 
I am down for an AMA anytime. 
It is not our first project, we started with GPU’s and moved on to asics and now are doing a bit of both. It is a side project that became a business as we are now working on 2 other products using immersion cooling that a much more sophisticated than what you see here. 
Planning and production took around 3 months, but that is largely due to the fact that we were doing for the first time and there was a lot to learn. It went smoothly overall, we obviously ran into some issues on the way but they were all solvable and the end result is working great. 
I am a big proponent of immersion cooling technologies and believe people should experiment with it to unlock unlock the full potential of this technology, and i hope my sharing this will motivate some people to buy a fish tank and dunk an ASIC or a GPU in there and start learning new ways of optimizing our machines 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:18:16
We installed all that ourselves, it is not that uncommon in industrial areas 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:20:06
Yes the fans are still on and we are tricking them as well to think they are spinning at 5k + Rpm. If you could find the guys you are describing I would be very interested in having a chat with them. We are almost done with a 2.0 version 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:18:18
Hey thank you! Yes, the fans are spinning, but in the other direction, thereby drawing the liquid form the bottom and helping convection. The liquid is cooled via a plated heat exchanger with water running through it form a garden hose �� 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:32:11
We are using a proprietary solution but similar results can be achieved using mineral oil or other dielectric fluids 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:57:20
If this type of thing interests you you should absolutely go for it. You can start with a fish tank and 1 Miner. It’s not all that difficult if you are already comfortable with operating the miners. A few hurdles on the way but definitely doable 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:02:29
The installation consumes 50kw, our bill comes in a little over 2k.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:25:38
Thank you! It is not noisy at all, the noise you hear in the video is mostly coming from an nearby machine. The coolant does not need to be changed as it does not absorb moisture or evaporate, however it needs to be filtered to not allow dust and Other particles to accumulate in it over time 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:49:06
They they are, making the installation fully silent (the noise you hear in the video is from a server standing near by) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:43:08
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:59:43
I don’t see why not. Will need some time though ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:28:51
Yes there is a transparent cover that goes over it to prevent particles from entering the vat, as well as a filter before the pump 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:53:54
We are using a plate heat exchanger designed for 70kw, it is roughly the size of a computer box. The container was designed and custom made by us for this project, it was not very complicated  to make. The pump is a 180. The failsafe is in the after market software on the miners that turns them off at Temps above 60c 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:54
We have had a few fans fail out of the 36, but then again some also failed in the air cooled set-ups as well, so I cannot be sure it is due to the liquid or simply poor built quality 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:26:52
Correct, ultimately this was done with the aim of overclocking the machines 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:12:20
Agree ���� will post some now 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:57:36
Yes 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:36:31
Thank you for your input and questions. Currently this setup consumes 50kw, the coolant is pumped through a 70kw heat exchanger which is connected to a regular tap. It is extremely viable to scale as the costs decrease dramatically when going beyond 10 vats in one space. The 10% increase reflects as roughly an extra 0.15BTC a month, which is enough to justify the extra costs. When you factor in all the details such as fire safely and density it becomes a very viable solution. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:51:45
Correct! We are heating the surrounding building with it now ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:33
That’s is exactly what we are doing ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:35:09
Thank you for the feedback! Those are some very good questions - ideally the water would cycle through the property or be drained back into the source (if you are in close proximity of a large body of water). In a household setting it would run up a 200$ water bill every month, which pales in comparison to a 2000$+ electricity bill for running 50kw of miners. On the upside you get around 1.5 BTC/Month 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:33:50
It’s a blend we made for this specific use, but mineral oil can work as a substitute 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:34:55
Working on it, but to reach economies  of scale we need a lot of working capital.. hoping BTC picks back up soon 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:31:23
In theory yes, for now we use it for heating this winter therefore saving on electricity costs 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:42:53
So far so good, some of them are running for 6 months now 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:02
You should read about immersion cooling it’s very cool stuff 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:04:42
Thank you! The break even on this installation is around a year in the current climate, and only a few months when BTC is closer to 20k. The rig should last a few years, depending on your electricity price, it might not be profitable to mine after a couple of years on an S9, but then you can replace it with newer versions 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:36:10
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:17:09
Part of the reason is they aid convection 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:30:40
It can be done but all we did is increase it because we are overclocking the miners. The savings come from the fact that the vat itself consumes under 500w 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:02:34
Thank you! Some answers:
1. Thé liquid is being pumped in a plate heat exchanger, the second contour of which has water running through it through a household tap. 
2. They are set up at our warehouses/basements and can be accommodated anywhere with access With enough electricity and running water. The by product being hot water, right now use it for heating. Not really worried about the cops, they will like what they see if they come looking. 
3. Thé installation consumes 50kw in total with 36 S9 units, and averages out around 1.5BTC a month, maybe a little less now.. 
4. It is always on, there is a filter before the pump that is changed once a month , but even that is not needed if you don’t open the lid too often( we open it all the time). 
5. I believe mining to be the entry point to the building of a decentralized neural network that will use its « hashpower » to process useful data, and that computational power which can be monetized by dedicating it to certain tasks will evolve in its complexity, and I see Bitcoin mining as a stage in that development process. 
I am very curious about the potential applications of AI chips such as the Sophon from Bitmain 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:31:42
I wish I was, but some people in team are very gifted 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:01:15
True, however in this case they aid convection because they are reversed from stock position, thus facilitating the flow of the cooler liquid form the bottom of the vat 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:02:55
Around 20k 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:11:32
Haha I think we are working towards that future 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:54:35
The best would be to cycle it on the property, heating the building 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:50:50
Guilty as charged 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:26:37
Around 0.08$/kw, which is bearable 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:44:08
I wish it was x36 ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:55:38
It’s around 20k, which bring its to under 20% of the cost of the miners, which by today’s prices will cost over 100k with PSU and Delivery. The good news is once you got it installed it consumes only water and 350w for the circulation pump, whereas an air cooled set up would be drawing at least 10 times that.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:12:50
Haha I am going to post more in a few Minutes 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:25:58
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:08:18
It is a mixture we have engineered for this purpose, but you could achieve a similar effect with mineral oils .. the price is in the 15$ range 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:09:38
Hey thank you I sent you a PM
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:45:59
Yes, but given the apocalypse happening on the markets right now it’s tough times 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:22:44
Our liquid is a lot more stable and does not deteriorate or absorb humidity, it is also completely harmless to your health so digging inside the vat is not a risk 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:38:22
I see what you mean, unfortunately I do not have such documents available for release however i am open to sharing what I know with the community here and walk you through the basics to avoid some mistakes we made when building this thing �� you better start soon so you can finish by summer! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:50:28
On average about 1.5 BTC 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:48:04
Thank you! The ones in the videos here are D3, the reason being at the time we had the pilot ready they were the most expandable in terms of costs, and since we needed to test them and overclock them to their limits, we figured using S9 would simply be too expensive. At this point we have built multiple vats, most of the them running S9. And yes, we have all the equipment at our locations. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:57:58
We are working on something like that ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:43:08
Smells like money 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:31:43
On thé whole i agree, and love GPU mining because of its versatility. FPGA are also a good middle ground. Having said that ASICs also offer opportunities for securing the network and providing more stability for certain fundamental coins. I think there is a place for all
Of them in the crypto space, and the market forces will decide who lives on. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:50:12
Yes, we work with a research lab to balance the liquid components in order to tailor its properties to our needs 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:42:32
We are already heating the building with it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:52:23
It started as a curiosity project and ended up exceeding our expectations. The density, quasi absconse of noise and heat, as well as low power consumption (under 500w) makes it a great setup for basements or industrial spaces where you cannot install a ventilation system 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:28:04
Thank you! Yes when I am able to answer questions I always try to help 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:05:26
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:01:52
Haha you can pm about your share �� 
I will be releasing detailed information to the community soon as we have been hard at work on a 2.0 version. As for optimization, we are currently using the water that comes out of it for heating, and there are countless ways having free hot water can benefit in many industrial and  farming businesses. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:55:34
No, novec is a two-phase liquid, this setup is single phase 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:21:05
Around 20k 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:47:41
Hey thank you! Yes, you got it spot on. The vat holds the Ethernet, power box, pilots, and monitoring system. The PSU and Miner are submerged and fans are reversed to aid convection 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:50:07
50 kw and tap water 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:55:20
Yes and they seem to love it ������
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:22:05
Haha yeah I hear Marc Cuban is Mining, he might go for it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:03:18
Yes that’s the ideal spot actually. Or a lake. Or à sea. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:32:57
Around 20k for the vat and 100+k for the 36 miners.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:24:03
About half..
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:45:44
Yes it is almost silent, the noise you hear in the other video is from a server standing next to it
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:38:47
Conservatively I would say 10% is your limit for stable operation. You can go beyond that buy energy consumption grows significantly and the system becomes unstable and requires constant monitoring. That 10% just barely manages to make the investment worth it, all things being equal. There is also the factor of convenience, density and noise. Using the vat you are able to host 36 miners in a room the size of the average bathroom  
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:42:30
I am thinking about making one since a lot of people are asking, in the meantime I can try to answer questions you might have 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:54:17
It a joint effort of us as a small team, we are full
Time miners so were able to commit to this project a little more than the average hobbyist 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:09:16
Congrats! That is one way of doing it and it works quite well! Yes I am aware there are several options available, to each his own version I guess �� It would be great to get updates on your set up, come join r/immersion_cooling for discussions on the topic
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:42:57
You can see all my posts on my account, i will be putting up more in the days to come 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:30:08
Haha come join r/immersion_cooling
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:10:33
Right not the entire vat consumes 50kw, you can squeeze more but need after market firmware as the default one will give out too many HW errors and increase power consumption beyond 10% overclocking 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:59:01
Vat alone around 20k+ , then it’s whatever you decide to put inside, an S9 is 2750$ these days on pre order, so count another 100k or so for 36 of them, a little more if you count the PSU.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:08
They really holding since summer ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:17:38
No, it is another liquid we have perfected specifically for this purpose 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:00:29
Thank you! Give it some time the markets will find and equilibrium for us all! 
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:45:51
Correct. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:09:51
Maybe vat without the miners is around 20k, with an ROI it around a year right now if buying S9 for 3k+ but that is temporary, it will get better once BTC price picks up. I like to aim for 1 year. Anything quicker I consider a present 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:28:47
Just submerge it, overclock it, and it will give you a few more years

Hey yes there are multiple failsafe mechanisms in place both on the miners (chip temp) ,In and outtake of the heat exchanger, as well as ambient temp sensor inside the vat which cuts the power above a certain temperature. We aim for it to be as fool-proof as possible 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:06:45
It costs around 20k, and allows for overclocking so it pays for the difference 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:36:40
Yeah not the best; we are working on a cleaner look for version 2.0
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:23:45
Not a necessity but we wanted to preserve the stock form factor and aid convection 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:28:12
Thank you for sharing, I am with you 100%!

All of them good questions, the liquid is a proprietary fluid that contains multiple additives, but similar results can be achieved using almost any dielectric. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:26:53
It will buy very slowly. It would take years to be affected by any contamination or evaporate 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:33:11
That too deep of a question for the comments section, but a reasonable way to look at it would be as a 1 year ROI 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:55:12
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:05:52
Yes all the fans are running and have been reversed to help convection 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:43:53
Around 1.5 BTC/Month on S9’s.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:20:56
There is a pump creating a jet from below; so the fans really help keep the hot hotter  liquid from going back into the unit 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:44:34
I am looking into making something of the sort 
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:34:15
Hey Kisuke, yes for this particular set-up it did come out to around 550$/unit, counting all the electrics, piping and Ethernet switch, as well as a monitoring system. The heat is removed via a heat exchanger with running water, which is then used for heating. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:26:09
Yes I know these guys, they make containers , 20ft and 40ft, but it costs an arm and a leg.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:24:23
What would that imply? ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:13:52
Yes that is one way of doing it, but it needs to work in the summer too �� and that would require building quite a maze. The best would be running through an existing heating system that would then pass through an outside maze, but would only work in countries when it’s cold year round 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:34:59
Correct; thank you. 
We try to aim for half the maximum temp as our benchmark. It can go a little warmer when overclocked, but in stock mode it remains within the 40-50c range

Hey yes I will be sharing the blueprints for the vat in r/immersioncooling very soon so you can visit it to find more info 
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:04:57
For now this is as small as it gets, as this technology makes increasingly more economic sense when scaled up, a 3 miner one would not be very viable in terms of ROI
@_date: 2018-04-11 09:00:29
It does get hot very quickly, so It is circulated via a heat exchanger 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:12:43
Thanks, you can PM me for the details :-)
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:54:32
Haha yes it is you can PM me for details
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:12:15
Hey! The coolant circulates through the heat exchanger at roughly 1m3, as for the details of the vat I will be sharing the blueprints for in on r/immersioncooling very soon so you can find the answers to most of your questions regarding dimensions in there. As for the size of the heat exchanger it is a model that is able to dissipate up to 70kw of heat 
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:09:31
They are mounted next to each other in 1 row; they are mounted on the inner structure of the custom made vat, I will share the blueprints to it soon on r/immersioncooling if you are interested in giving it a try
