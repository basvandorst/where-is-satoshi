Fellow young bro, if you value your money a lot, you should be in BTC. As we speak, the Federal Reserve is lowering rates, our fiat money will be less valuable in the coming years. Whereas BTC is deflationary...all in

In my mid 20s and have all my net worth in BTC. If it goes bust, good, more time to grind.

I’d like to add to my previous comment. As a mid-20 something guy with 100% of net worth and savings in BTC, my philosophy right now is as follows: don’t spend money on stupid stuff, stack sats, don’t hold fiat beyond what is necessary, stack sats, eat clean and train hard, stack sats, work hard at day job and work on side hustles, stack more sats, DON’T CHECK THE PRICE TOO OFTEN, stack sats :) More importantly, educating myself on macroeconomics. BTC has made me curious about the history of finance. Understand how money works, how central banks work, etc. What makes hard, sound money? 
Hit 30 in the mid 2020s and see what happens.

Feels like a coiled spring these days, explosion imminent and prophecy unfolding.

Boys, you've been here before, you know what to do. Buy the goddamn dip and do your future self a favor. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, continue being a savage. No fear!
