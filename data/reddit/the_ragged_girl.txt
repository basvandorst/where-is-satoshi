2,100,000,000,000,000  (satoshi) divided by 8,000,000,000 (approximate world population) equals 262,500 sats per person. Assume 20% of bitcoins are/will be lost forever still leaves sufficient sats for ~ 200,000 sats per person. This leaves a lot of room for any perceived necessity of inflationary/deflationary forces (according to “basic economics”?) to be proven mute. In other words there could be scope for new economic “rules” to be explored.

The last 3 days’ average volume is 25% lower compared to the previous 2 weeks’ average (~$18,000,000,000 compared to ~ $24,000,000,000) according to Coinmarketcap.com. This seems like a huge difference in actual $ terms. Does anyone have an explanation for this?

Everyone holding BTC today is an expert trader who is destined to have all the monies and the moons and all those that hold none are weak heretic whores who deserve all the scorn and derision the expert traders can pile on. 
And the expert traders will pile on with laughter and glee and they will wallow in their satisfaction from their basement palaces on their vinyl thrones and when they arise they will walk tall and proud and knowingly deserving. 
And many of the noble experts will generously offer very sincere condolences to those less fortunate in this thread.

What makes this particular fist a communist fist? I recognise the clenched fist symbol as the anti-fascist symbol of the Left, popularised during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930’s. It was a protest symbol against a harsh regime. It has since also been used to represent the Black Power movement and other protests/uprisings by various persecuted minorities so to me its appearance on a poster symbolising Bitcoin seems to represent a stance against a perceived unfairness of current financial inequalities rather than having anything to do with supporting communism. 
Had the poster included the hammer and sickle symbols then fair enough, but on its’ own the raised fist has represented many struggles over the last 100 years that were unrelated to communism. Also, I’ve never seen a communist flag using red and white together. Communist flags are usually all red, or red/black diagonal halves.

He who paid 10% in fees to the ATM operator for his BTC yesterday has more bitcoin today than his clever brother who will pay much less in fees but whose purchase will be delayed 2 days while he does the bank transfer and KYC hoola hoopla nervous jumping dance.

Could you help me understand how humans liking round numbers actually keeps the market closer to these round numbers? Is this an aesthetic preference?
If so then humans would need to collectively sell at (say) 8188 in order to keep bitcoin trending toward their preferred number of 8000. This seems counterintuitive to me in a financial market where it is assumed most people are interested in the price trending one way or the other for reasons separate from aesthetics. Also, how is the selling coordinated? Is this a similar phenomenon to a flock of birds flying in formation?
Also, what forces are pushing bitcoin away from the preferred round numbers? Do these forces dislike humans and are these forces motivated to keep the price away from round numbers  by their dislike of humans or do they have more selfish motivations, such as an aesthetic dislike of round numbers? 
Are there particular round numbers that humans prefer over other round numbers? Is 10000 preferred over 11000? Is 100000 preferred over 90000? 
Also, I don’t recognise any preference for round numbers over non round numbers in myself, but I do identify as a human. Are there other humans who, like me, are indifferent to the roundness of numbers for the sake of roundness itself? If so, do these humans have any effect on the market?

Maybe they have come knocking. The site could be a honeypot for all the ignoranmi know.
