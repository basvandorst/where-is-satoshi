Thank you so much.

I get amazed by people who waste their time with such comments.

Right now coinatmradar updated their map. When I checked their maps couple of weeks ago they ATMs operated by PYC (pycbitcoin.com). Their website is down now and ATMs not available as I mentioned in my post.

My complain is not about providing information. What I am trying to say is that many people speak of bitcoins as anonymous currency. Well, buying bitcoins is definitely not anonymous.

Look, I just described the difficulty of buying btc. I didn't say anything negative about bitcoin itself. I love the whole technology behind it and I enjoy the way you transact using bitcoins. However, acquiring btc is unnecessarily complex. One should be able to buy btc with three-four clicks. That's all I am trying to say.

I will closely follow the regulatory framework and its influence on bitcoin adoption.

I think everyone sees what they want in my post. I raised several important points including: limits, instant purchases, vendor trust, AML/KYC, availability of certain services, regulations...
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:49:25
Could you please describe how exactly you buy bitcoins? Thank you
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:51:24
Ok, but before doing my transaction in bitcoin I need to get some. My salary is paid in fiat unfortunately. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:50:35
Yes, I didn't mention cash deposit. Still, it is not an instant solution.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:13:18
I'd be grateful if you could point out other mistakes. I never claimed to be absolutely right with all my points. I shared my experience and asked to correct me if I was wrong. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:42:02
Thanks everyone for the advice. I will check it out. I don't want the whole salary to be paid in btc, but some portion of it absolutely. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:05:37
I think it is an exaggeration to say that there is a high demand for bitcoin. And supply mechanism is imperfect as described in the post. Therefore, people HAVE TO pay high premium to buy btc. Supply is restricted. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:09:48
I didn't say anywhere that btc sucks. There is a reason why buying cars take time. There is no reason why buying btc should take 4/5 days and require so much efforts.
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:11:51
If you assume so then you are more than welcome to check them out. I didn't check out Sonny's Groceries. My mistake here and thanks for pointing out.

I hate all these comparisons with the Internet. Look, we live in the 21st century. You can simply use your debit card to buy btc. Again, it's just three four simple clicks. We have the technology. What we don't have is proper regulation and trust. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:50:32
Ok. Thank you.
What I wrote was that there was no anonymity in buying btc through Coinbase. You can buy for cash and etc. but I am talking about legit methods whereas you have to record your transaction, maybe pay taxes. Most Americans won't buy bitcoins from localbitcoins.com. If you buy btc in the right way, then there is no anonymity. After you start doing transactions all the records of how you spend your btc are stored in blockchain. Most Americans won't use "bitcoin fog" and other illegal services to keep their privacy. So btc is not anonymous when purchased and used legally.
Coinbase offers 1000/week limit when you link your credit card. You still have to wait 4/5 days for btc to arrive to your account. If there are other brokers offering instant purchases, please share their names. Thank you.

If it is easier to buy btc then more people will buy it. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:47:50
Good point, but I am not complaining about price fluctuations. In my view it is very natural that the price of btc fluctuates. What I am complaining about is that during these 4/5 days I was like a spectator in theater watching the price going down without an ability to react. If the purchase was instant then I wouldn't have had such problem. I would have done something with btc I hold. Convert to fiat or transfer to bitreserve.org, for example.
@_date: 2015-04-09 15:56:34
Anything less than 1000/week is instant. 
There was no exaggeration with %. I also complained about providing a lot of personal information to the company that I do not know exactly how stores my personal information. When I provide information to Citi I know that I provide to the company with reputation and history that is also properly regulated by the government. Why should I trust coinbase ?
