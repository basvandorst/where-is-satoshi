You sure like to make irrelevant arguments.

I don't claim to know everything. I also don't claim economists know what will become of bitcoin. But bitcoin is currently following a pattern that we've seen before, maybe in different magnitudes. Where it goes from here is anyone's guess.

I'm not going to dignify that statement.

Dude, season 4 is the best one.

Really? Because I graduated with an Econ degree and bitcoin is doing exactly what I'd expect any commodity to do when there is speculation.

The book we used in Money and Banking was: Money, Banking, and the Financial System by Hubbard, R. Glenn and Anthony Patrick O’Brien. 
Economic history was a long time ago, so I'm not sure of the book we used but the current syllabus says: History of the American Economy by Gary M. Walton. 
However, these are both textbooks and probably expensive. If you are interested in an economic podcast, [Planet Money]( is my favorite, and a great place to start interesting you in economic discussion.

It's meant to be used as a type of currency, and is definitely indicative of what technology can do. But for all intents and purposes, it's not being treated like a currency, and it doesn't (currently) have the stability that a currency needs to work.

Whether it rises drastically or fails miserably is outside of any of my presumptions. Economists know these things are unpredictable. There's actually a pretty good [Planet Money]( podcast about it. They were talking about how great a phenomenon Bitcoin was and how interesting it would be to see what happens. The next day was the crash.

I guess you could say the intrinsic value lies in the prospect that bitcoin has been more profitable than gold in the last two years.

Not specifically. But Econ history very much touches on the variety of currencies in different time periods and how one currency can drastically inflate/deflate compared to another. It's very much why people invest in international currencies when there is a disaster in that country; because there is speculation as to the increased value of that currency (in a developed country) once the country gets back on its feet. This speculation then drives the value of the currency up as well. It's not a perfect comparison, but a pretty analogous situation.

Well, you are in You'll find that if you ask people outside of here, including other subs, like that people are much more skeptical.
