I agree with your take on the bitcoin thing, but I disagree with your edit. If you think that the amount people tip doesn't effect how much the restaurant pays you, you don't understand the economics of the situation.
If people stopped tipping or tipped less, restaurants would be forced to pay you more. The people who currently stiff you are causing the restaurant to have to pay you what little they do. If everyone started tipping more, the restaurant would pay you less. If everyone started tipping less, the restaurant would pay you more.
The reason wait staff's hourly wages haven't gone up in step with other jobs is because wait staff have convinced people that they need to tip more (expected tip has gone from 10% to 20% since I can remember). If you all hadn't done that, restaurants would now be paying you more. At best it's done nothing for you, but more likely it's just shooting yourselves in the foot.
"Stiffing your waiter" does and is effecting the system.
Edit: Rewording for clarity.

I've used BitInstant before and had no problems, but I tried to use it again and screwed it up. It was totally my fault and I apologize to you for the inconvenience, but I hope I can get some customer service here. I typed in the wrong BitStamp account ID and now I don't know where my money is. My order ID is: 20a19fe7-1131-430e-9a6c-a9a66483fae2 Thank you.
Edit: I've just found the order status page. It says the order is completed, but seeing as how the BitStamp account ID I typed is a word, and BitStamp account IDs use numbers, I'm wondering where the money went.
