I mean, it at least let's you see a 24h change especially if they also present a daily graph of how these 24 hours went?
After all, same can be said for any price there, they may not change fast as bitcoin but they still change after that paper is printed.

God that is a visual out of a cyberpunk movie.

I once bought around $15 worth of Bitcoin like 2 years ago. Sold it after like 3 days because I needed my money for something else and it felt pointless (also Bitcoin had a major dip then raised back)
I know it isn't much but seeing all the "BITCOIN IS AT A MILLION DOLLARS" stuff make me think... should I really get into it?

I don't think I will, I also think I will because it is really unstable compared to those other options. So it doesn't matter what I think, really.


Except it is not consistent.


You are right, which is why Bitcoin isn't for me. It is not consistent.

What if it is actually lost and some clueless intern found it and reformatted it to use it himself?

With the current rates, it doesn't seem to be useful as an investment tool anymore, at least for a student like me. I can invest let's say 300 bucks, I get 400 bucks in return. If I bought when it was low and held onto it for YEARS which I doubt most people did, only then would I get any significant profit.
So I guess no, it isn't useful (for me).

Yep, it seems that at this point, to earn millions from bitcoin, you need to already have millions. And if you don't have reserves, you don't get much. I have 300 bucks at the bank, if I invested all into Bitcoin I would just get 30 bucks back.

As wrong place, do you mean or Reddit?
Because latter sounds more likely...
