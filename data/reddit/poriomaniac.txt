There's no greater myth in trading than that christmas crashes occur for the specific purpose of spending money.

This is garbage. Not the same as the earlier planned s2x at all.
A shitcoin by any other name...

You're saying this is back on?

Why would you want to have *less* copies for yourself??

I don't see that kind of delay in a bitcoin transaction as something to smile about.

While I agree with most of what you said, you calling everybody 'my guy' is probably the most obnoxious thing in this very ugly thread!

In terms of dollar spread we must be in the tallest 1 hour candle in history.

How did that one look?

I wonder if I can check my bitcoin-24, havelockinvestments (how's my AsicMiner and NEOBEE stocks doing these days? Well, I hope!), campbx, btc-e and btct.co accounts?
hmm, pretty sure I left some coins of Silk Road and Mt Gox as well!

For some reason I can't reach DPR, let me know if you hear of his whereabouts!
(but seriously OP,  this is good advice. I did the same and ended up with a nice bit of extra btc that I thought I'd lost)

The thing is, with cocaine and hookers, you can choose when you get your rushes. Bitcoin has the extra element of surprise.

That's not true though. His job is to produce for the creditors a preareanged 2014 equiv fiat valuation for the btc - which he has now acheived. The current value doesn't mean anything to him or, in theory, to his creditors (mt gox victims that elected to receive the money in fiat).

Holy moses, I refuse to believe that the fucking CFO of Visa is this ignorant!
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:10:18
Everybody keeps saying that he could have sold smarter and made more money, ostensibly to benefit the creditors. But he made exactly as much money as he needed to to fulfill what was owed to the creditors. How would getting a better deal magically mean the creditors receive any more than the prearranged amount owed?

Well, how about instead of being pretentious douchebags you guys add something of substance?
This kind of obnoxious commentary is a lot more annoying than any of the hopium posts.

Wait, Moolah's in prison? What was Karpeles sentence? Didn't Shavers get a prison sentence? I feel like I've missed so much.. Your links are useless.
