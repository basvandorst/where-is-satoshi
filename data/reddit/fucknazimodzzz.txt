All bubbles occur when a commodities value is artificially inflated to unsustainable levels. Which is exactly what we're seeing here. 
And I have no idea what you're talking about, I've only starred warning people in the last year because that's when it became abundantly clear that the bubble was going to pop in the near future 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:02:06

Because it is going to crash. Bitcoin is in a bubble same as the housing market crash in 08. And guess what experts warned of the housing market crash years before it happened and all the morons enjoying the temporary benefits said the exact same thing you're saying now. 
Bitcoin is going down. It's just a matter of time. Many will make bank but I think many more will lose. Don't say I didn't warn you.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:55:05
Keep dreaming.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:53:41
I do have an idea of what's going to happen. Because I went to school for this. You think this is the first time a market blew up with people seemingly making money hand over fist out of nowhere? Fucking lol. Ever heard of the Great Depression? The 08 housing crash? It's the same principle here.
Congratulations you've pumped up the value of your Monopoly money to far above any honest analysis. A bubble I dare say. I might sound bitter but I don't want people to lose their money. That's why I'm here warning against it. 
Bitcoin is going to take the final plunge. It's going to happen. Anyone who knows anything about finance and economics can see this. There will be winners but there will be far more losers, and the later you buy in the more likely you are to be a loser. Good luck.

As a young person who understands technology and is about to graduate with a degree in economics, bitcoin is a pretty stupid investment.
It does fit the definition of a Ponzi scheme but since I'm in this subreddit I won't call it that. It is however, an extremely volatile and unbacked currency. It's not a question of if bitcoin will crash, but when. I'm sure some of you who were lucky enough to get in on this early made some money, but it's just not a good idea from a financial standpoint to buy bitcoin today. Would appreciate it if you guys stopped encouraging people to make bad financial decisions.

It is true that the difference between currency and Ponzi scheme is not as big as people think, however currencies like the US dollar are backed by globally recognized governments with triple A credit ratings.
Bitcoin behaves more like a commodity than a currency, which is why it's dangerous and misleading to refer to bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:40
Clearly. Cryptocurrency is shady as fuck and people legitimately think it's the next big thing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:07:59
It really scares me how many of you guys are clueless about economics.
You can't replace an economy. Are you talking about replacing the US dollar? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:27:22
For the people coming from r/all , here's a handy guide on the different types of users found in r/bitcoin:
The OG: this guy got on the train and left the station before most others even had a destination. He bought in so early that the risks are almost zero and the potential gains are huge. Here we have an example right in front of us. This cat bought in at 300 so he's most likely going to make a tidy profit. The OG can be recognized by a carefree attitude as they sit back with a bowl of popcorn, content to watch the filthy masses struggle as they bask in the knowledge that they're going to come out ahead in virtually every scenario short of a Chernobyl level disaster. 
The Gambler: Probably the most intelligent, or at least the most honest kind of user found here. The Gambler is well aware of the dangers and pitfalls of bitcoin and attempts to skillfully avoid them. He plays it fast and loose, buying and selling in the short term in response to fluctuations in value. The Gambler will usually let you know straight up that what they're doing is essentially gambling and shouldn't be attempted by new players. 
The Snake ��: the most dangerous and second most common user you'll find here. If the OG was the first to leave the station, the snake is the one who jumped at the last second and just barely made it onto the caboose. The snake usually has substantial stake in bitcoin, and stands to either lose big or win big. They will do what little they can to influence this result by encouraging others to make poor and hasty decisions for the snake's benefit. You can almost always recognize the snake by quotes such as "why are people panicking? They're just shaking out the weak hands. HODL" or "looks like bitcoin took a dip today, time to buy ��." The calm and collected facade they put up is a deception to mask the fact that their buttox are clenched hard enough to crack a walnut and their blood pressure spikes in response to every tiny dip. The snake wants to get as many people to buy bitcoin as possible to drive up the value of their own investment. It doesn't matter if you're struggling to pay rent, or down to your last dollar for that matter. If you ask The Snake if you should buy bitcoin, the answer will always be yes. Beware the snake.
The Sheep: The newbies. They just showed up at the station and are wondering where the train went. They probably heard about bitcoin from a friend or from an article they just read. They don't know anything about what they're getting into besides the fact that they're supposed to make easy money here. They could have sunk a couple thousand or a quarter million into this market depending on how much they have. There are go getters and there are those who get got. The sheep has been got. If you heard about bitcoin on CNN or bought in in the last 1-2 months, sorry, you're a sheep.
The True Believer: The rarest type of user, perhaps making up only 2-3% of the population. You'll know the true believer when you encounter him. He won't stop talking about how blockchain technology is the future and how it's going to revolutionize finance as we know it (Spiel may contain elements of anarcho-capitalism ideology). The True Believer genuinely believes that blockchain is the future, and who are we to say he's wrong? The True Believer often seems to hold the money making aspect as a secondary concern, and will sometimes make a Buddha-like comment about how "Bitcoin may die, but blockchain will live on."
The Doomsayer: Abandon hope all ye who enter here. The Doomsayer knows the bridge that spans the next valley is fatally flawed. He attempts to yell to the passing train to turn back, for the passengers to jump off, but his warnings are dismissed as the ravings of a bitter old man. The Doomsayer knows bitcoin is in a bubble that is bound to burst. It should happen this month...or the next...or sometime next year. One thing is certain, the end is near. 
Hope this handy guide helps you on your travels. Happy hunting.

For the love of god stop him. Or at least make sure he's aware that bitcoin is one part gambling and one part greater fool scheme. If he's aware of this and knows what he's doing he should proceed with caution. If he's not aware, definitely don't let him do that.
I have no sympathy for redditors who cry about losing money because I know they've seen countless warnings like mine and elected to ignore them. However I feel terrible for the people who have just learned about bitcoin from mainstream sources and get duped into this shady business.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:35:00

It sounds like he probably knows what he's getting into. While I usually don't tell people to buy bitcoin there is room for profit for people who really know what they're doing. 
Just as long as he doesn't go in with the mentality that he can make easy money buy just holding bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:15:11

Yes. GDP is a measure of the purchasing power of the average person. You can't simultaneously reduce GDP growth AND produce stuff people want at an affordable cost. That's not how it works. If that does happen it's a sign that something has gone horribly wrong in that country, basically it means that an upper class is hoarding all the wealth 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:34:13
You just said that you lost a couple thousand?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:16:21
That's not how it works at all. The rise of bitcoin is highly due to outside circumstances such as publicity and media attention as well as just general awareness of the product. These are things you can't really predict by looking at graphs and financial data. 
However., The rapid inflation of bitcoin is something that everyone who's taken an Econ class should be familiar with. It's called a bubble. You can look at the graphs and the data and compare it with past events to predict where it's going in the future. That is essentially what the study of economics is: looking at data from past events and comparing it to current events to predict future occurrences. 
It's not a 100% science but It's abundantly clear that nothing good comes from artificial bubbles like the one bitcoin is in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:58

Not true. The people who take the big losses have almost always been duped by more savvy parties, whether that be bankers or real estate agents or in the case, the people with a big stake in bitcoin. 
Also, stop talking about the technology. It's totally irrelevant to the value of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:54:37
The bubble hasn't popped yet. this kind of volatility is expected and anyone you see referring to these recessions as "minibubbles" or "microbubbles" doesn't have a clue what they're talking about. 
Believe me when the bubble bursts you will have zero doubt that the bubble has just burst 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:03:16
It checks all the boxes.
Cult like following that don't think for themselves? ✅
The promise of easy money from the magic money tree if you just buy what they're selling ✅
Guys at the top of the chain stand to make the most money with little risk, while the newer guys have much more risk. ✅
"Revolutionary" technology that few know about and even fewer actually understand that's totally going to change the world ✅
The technology in question has been in beta for nearly a decade with no significant progress being made. ✅
Oh you will see me in a few years. Can't wait tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:08:15
Anyone who sells in a recession is doing the right thing. You have to cut your losses somewhere. 
Maybe they scorn "weak hands" because the value of bitcoin literally depends on demand exceeding supply. Once supply exceeds demand it's gonna get real bad.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:09:30
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:51:24
No. It's not. 
In fact good advice is far and in between in this sub. It feels more like a blackjack table than a financial circle. Probably because bitcoin is gambling at best and a greater fool scheme at worst 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:55:49
Sorry you felt it was condescending, I was just stating my qualifications. I have a degree in economics. 
Once again economics is not an exact science. I can't tell you with certainty where bitcoin is going to peak and when the bubble is going to burst because that's not something I can predict. It's almost totally dependent on the whales and since I can't read their minds I don't know when they will sell. 
What I can tell you with certainty is that the value of bitcoin is artificially inflated by sudden and intense demand, and the value of bitcoin is ONLY due to this high demand. Yeah there's some new tech rolled into it but that's largely irrelevant since 99% of people are in it for money. So basically, bitcoin is in a bubble and due to crash hard and we know this because this exact scenario has played out in different markets several times before I don't know what else you want from me. If you want hard data go do a little research on Black Tuesday.
As for you asking me to give you specific price points and time frames, hang on lemme just roll my crystal ball. You're either A. Asking me for things you know I can't come up with, no economist could come up with what you're asking with anything other than their best guess, or B. Totally ignorant of what you're actually asking for. 
Forgive me but *you* actually don't seem to be adding anything here other than vaguely passive aggressive skepticism. Do you not think bitcoin is in a bubble or are you just arguing for arguments sake?
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:43:47
1. Are you going to pretend that you guys don't act like buying bitcoin will result in guaranteed profit? Because that's what I see happening a over Reddit.  And furthermore Ponzi schemes don't always promise a profit, but make it seem as if the chance of financial gain is so great that it would be stupid to pass up. And this most definitely applicable to bitcoin 
2. Bitcoin has absolutely skyrocketed on the last few years. In which time period has bitcoin stagnated for years on end?
3. Ponzi schemes as we knew them before the internet were centralized. This is new territory.

No, bitcoins insane volatility is because of the fact that it's essentially a Ponzi scheme combined with gambling. At least some of the people here are smart enough to acknowledge it although far too many are in denial.
