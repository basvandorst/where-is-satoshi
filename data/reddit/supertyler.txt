If everyone did this perhaps we could get Mark back into a job

More supply =&gt; lower prices =&gt; more new buyers =&gt; wider adoption =&gt; more demand =&gt; higher long term value/price.
It's win win, the US govt offloads bitcoins it does not need (at around 400% profit), the ecosystem gets a publicity boost, and the futures market can stop worrying about the threat of a flooded market.

Mike is a seriously Switched on dude.  Great to see this project get the recognition it deserves. Not sure if you influenced Mike into releasing opensource early, but if so well done!

Someone is sweeping up the coins sent to this address [1Mf4...]( once or twice an hour (so no rush - wierdly), and consolidating then into the main 'hack' recipient address.
Looking the history on this particular source address (it's been in use since mid 2013), there was an unusual tx to another address for just over 1000 BTC shortly before the first tx to the alleged 'hack' address (3200 BTC), so, to speculate wildly, if someone was holding a private key they were not supposed to have and waiting for the right time to unload the bitstamp coffers, i guess this could have spurred them into action...
Also - There was a [transaction]( from this address to at least one known address (Bitcoin exchange Bitmarket.lt) in the past few days, so they may be in a position to shed light on the source

it means "we're not allowed to say bitcoin, but, you know, bitcoin"
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:19:40
Still happening?  Tx for .79 btc (with 0.1 btc tx fee) less than an hour ago

Well, it shares at least one source address with many of the other transactions (1Mf478S7eWk7SmjJ7XmUX1c65mWFCqCkFK, which appears in 42 transactions to the same destination).
I did some basic analysis on the addresses involved, many of them appear multiple times, here are the top 10.
If not involved - it would be useful for Bitstamp to confirm.
(note - since previous post another 2 tx's have been confirmed, 0.68 with a fee of 0.2 BTC and 0.71 with a fee of 0.15 btc)

Q1. Would this model require X confirmations before delivery of mail?  If so, that's a pretty big usability flaw.
Q2. As several folks have suggested the intention here is to target spam only.  Perhaps with some refinement this could be achieved.  How about constructing a multisig transaction which incorporates the following logic:
Alice submits message to Bob and passes initial fee to "god"
"god" constructs a multisig transaction to Bob which also requires Bobs signature to become valid, and which expires after X days, at which point unclaimed fees are automatically returned back to Alice.
I think "god" in this scenario may be something similar to the NoRiskWallet described [here]( which come to think of it might also offer a way solve the zero confirmation problem.
This would allow bob to penalise spam, and would not penalise regular correspondence beyond perhaps a small 'float' needed for high volume senders.

if you would, good sir

Read the post to make sure this was top of the list - only to find it wasn't even included. Immediately head to comments to make sure someone had set the record straight. Balance restored... and all thanks to the lord of la mancha

what did you end up with? I'm doing a similar thing... 
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:39:40
Ledger have recently presented a number of alleged Trezor vulnerabilities, including some which permit key recovery (for balance - I believe Trezor have largely refuted the scope of vulnerability). Methods are highly specialised and require custom kit but if the value is substantial enough it might be worth reaching out to Charles at Ledger. One more thing - avoid updating firmware until you know more, I’m unsure how Trezor updates are applied so this might not be possible anyway, but in this case older might be better.
