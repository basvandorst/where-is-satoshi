I take your point about music, but perhaps in future an mp3 will be the 'sweat shop' version of a song while the 'block-chain-provided song' could be the 'fair trade' version.

De Nederlandse 'chief economist' by Citigroup, Willem Buiter, heeft het bij het verkeerde eind als hij over  zegt: "Anything that can be programmed can be hacked". Het unieke van bitcoin is dat het tot nu toe niet gehackt is hoewel daar miljoenen mee te verdienen zouden zijn. Bitcoin is een doorbraak in computer science.
Deze verwarring komt wellicht omdat Willem een econoom is en niet een computer scientist. Hij praat dus over iets waarvoor hij niet gestudeerd heeft. Het zou goed zijn als Willem eens een dagje vrij nam om zich een beetje beter in bitcoin te verdiepen voordat hij hier uitspraken over doet in het openbaar.
