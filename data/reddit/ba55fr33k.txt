look at trade volumes..

because people keep treating it like a commodity
if it was treated like currency then it would just increase proportional with adoption
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:54:03
huh, i should print those.. then when you load em up I'll already know your private key

satoshi ain't the only one out there with megga stashed, sharp drops in price cause by big sell offs prompt others to do so as well
so long as there are people with thousands of coins they paid pennies for there will be volatility, once it is actually used as currency by people who buy it as currency instead of commodity then it will be relatively stable like any other currency
most bitcoins are still owned by a handful of people

price stability will only happen once all zombies are dead

the more people use local trading the less corporate and controlled it will all become
paranoia will result in regulation and the end of privacy

bitcoin mines drive off-grid power generation industry?

how about $250 for 100,000,000Satoshi?
seems like an early adopter bargain to me

anyone who lost money on bitcoin thinking it would be a great investment deserved it. bitcoin is currency not stocks, hang on to a $1000 bill til 50 years from now and see what it buys you
all those people hoping to cash in by jumping on the bandwagon made the price go up too fast &amp; are now crying in their beers while it corrects for realistic market capitalization
