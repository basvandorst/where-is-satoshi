Is it stupid when when Jewish people say they're "ethnically Jewish" too? The anti christian bigotry rising in this country is fascist. You are a fuxking bigot. 
And Christianity is the biggest religion in the world yet you are only attributing it to white counties like the racist you are.

Since yiure liberal, would you support code that would be added to bitcoin that would slowly remove coins from high balance wallets and distribute them to low balance and minority wallets? Historically, black people have had to deal with slavery and don't have nearly as many coins as white people so it's important to resdiatribute in your eyes right? Is bitcoin a human right like healthcare and college?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:05:22


No they don't. You can get a DNA test right now and find out what percentage French/German/Italian you are in the same way you can determine "Jewishness" (which is just another way of saying "semitic"). Who ever decided what amount of "purity" counts as ethnicity?
My genes can be shown to be European in the same way a Jew's genes can be shown to be Semitic. How come Semitic genes count for something but European genes do not? 


If Americans lived separately from Europeans long enough that clear differences could be found in the genetics between the two groups, why couldn't we say that I'm "Ethnically American"? Or "Ethnically European"? I don't understand why you are giving Jews some special monopoly on the idea of them being "ethnic" that no other race/religion/nationality can achieve...
I consider my ethnicity to be White/Arab American Christian (Im half Lebanese but I look white). If that's not my ethnicity, then what is? 


So why can't this be the same for Christians?


You just said that Jews can have the same religion but not have the same ethnicity. Now you're using that very fact in the Christian context to disprove the fact that there is such thing as Christian ethnicity? 
The double standard here boggles my mind.

The whole argument for NN is that it "keeps isps from making 'fast lanes' and tiering the internet!" If we don't have NN, the isps can tier our service and create unfair fast lanes and slow lanes right?
But NN has been law since 2015, and Verizon removed unlimited data plans and tiered the new plans. All ISPs still have tiered "business" plans vs lower prices/lower bandwidth "retail" plans. All isps still offer "family plans" that give you different data and price rates than individual plans. These are all instances of "injustice and unfairness" that NN was supposed to get rid of....... but didn't.
So since NN doesn't do what people says it does, can you explain to me what it actually does?

Google is censoring information and websites, fb censors everything, twitter will kick you off their platform if you say that men have penises and can't have vaginas.

I still think equality should be programmed into bitcoin. The early adopters DID NOT build bitcoin, everybody built bitcoin by paying their taxes. Satoshi didn't build that, we all did. So higher balances of coin in addresses should slowly be distributed to lower balance addresses until there's an equal amount of coin in all active wallets.
Further, it's only a matter of time before coins have to start taking justice and fairness serious so we should start figuring out to work affirmative action into bitcoin. I thought that if miners were able to identify their race, then minority miners could have a better chance at solving blocks. And Asians should have a harder time solving blocks (same rules we use for the SAT). This would ensue racial fairness in bitcoin because right now it's so WHITE and that's the real problem.
I've sent a thousand emails to blockstream about all this. I'm thinking about starting a protest if anyone wants to help coordinate. If we don't make headway with bitcoin, I wrote up a whitepaper for a completely fair new coin that embraces justice and equal rights, I call it BernieCoin and if anyone can help me program it, we could go moon together. 
TL;DR Bitcoin is a HUMAN RIGHT and the fact that one race of people has a majority of the coin is problematic. DONATE YOUR COIN TO A MINORITY TODAY

If fiat dollars crash, bitcoin will become insanely valuable. Why do you think it's being sold for 35k in Zimbabwe right now? Bitcoin was LITERALLY created as a hedge against the inflationary nature of fiat. Are you aware that the genesis block of bitcoin has a message written into that explicitly states that the 2008 bailouts are the reason Satoshi created bitcoin in the first place?
Check out the "Book of Satoshi". It's a compilation of his forum communications with the other "cypherpunks".

This is the whole point of crypto currencies dude

As long as the gold is in assay and stamped with a credible gov or corp logo, how is the person you sell it going to know if it's counterfeit or not? There's also electronics that measure the volume/weight displacement to verify it's real gold:

If the global economy collapses, there will be two kinds of people: Those with coins and those without. Check out the movie "Banking on Bitcoin" if you have Netflix. If you don't have Netflix, check out Mike Maloneys piece on bitcoin that is available for free on YouTube.
Here's a tip: Ripple (xrp) is currently 1.41 dollars. By this time next year it will be $10 at least. You can thank me later for that one

But you shouldn't. The $10 will be crushed by fees and you will turn off newcomers.

You are a bigot dude. You are a fascist. You make"pure blood" arguments like a psycho and then you will call Christians Nazis and for saying "merry Christmas"
Since you've pointed out that Jews have "pure blood" because they don't marry other races, doesn't that make them racist by your standards? Imagine if I said that Mexican people couldn't be Americans because traditionally America has "white genes"? Would that be racist? 
It's just so shocking to me how we've reached a point where it's open season to rip apart Christians for ANYTHING yet the slightest criticism of Muslims or Jews will get you fired from your job. 
The left has ushered in fascism to America

On top of the the fees on your exchange it costs about $15-20 every time you make a transaction with BTC. This is because the mempool is incredibly backed up and confirmations will take a long time. Try making a transaction from the exchange you got BTC on to your wallet. Observe how much it costs. You cannot use BTC to buy a coffee for $5 if it's gonna cost you $15 just to confirm the transaction.
Gotta study up on this kind of thing before you make rash decisions bud. With btc, your gold crumbles away as you send it around.

Get the fuck out of here with threats you communist piece of shit. In a free society no has to give a shit what a communist thinks about them. ANYONE has the opportunity to buy coin right now, ANYONE. 


Then the Coin Wars will commence. And you keep using the term "You". Do you not hold coin as well? Are you here just to fucking lecture everyone about the what the poor are gonna do to them when Coin becomes the world reserve? Fuck off and die.

Each persons wallet is connected directly to their social security number and that one wallet is all that anyone is allowed to use. If there is social security # fraud, then we start doing facial recognition and other biometrics in order to authenticate. Eventually we will all just have secure elements chips (nano s chip) in our arms and our own DNA will Authenticate transactions.
I really do have a BernieCoin white paper on all this if you are interested in doing an ICO

Ahhhhh the "pure blood" argument. Seems about right for you to only base the idea of "ethnicity" solely on race and genes and not on the larger culture, customs and traditions. Exactly what is expected from a racist tho. Jews have pure blood so they get special privileges. Absolutely psychotic

I hate the kkk and never would associate with anything they are a part of. I am defending Christianity from a bigoted attack and you make me out to be kkk for it? That's where we are at as a country, isn't it? The racism from you fascists is absolutely astonishing

I don't think communists support bitcoin because it goes against their principles. Shouldn't communists want bitcoin to be programmed to slowly make all balances the same? For instance, communists support the idea of "equity", that everyone should have roughly the same amount of material wealth. It would be quite easy for blockstream to program bitcoin to slowly take coins from high balance wallets and distribute those coins to low balance wallets (second layer payment channel). Do you think communist coin hodlers would support this communist change to the code of bitcoin? Why or why not?
