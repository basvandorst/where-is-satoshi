Hi Reddit! Here's why i made this app:
 
I was very much fascinated by cryptocurrency and started investing. First week was fine as i was new to everything then i started to realize there are so many problems and it's not easy to do trading or hodling cryptocurrency. I will summarize the problems
 
*  For everything i need to use different sites and every site does not support all fiat currencies
* I use mobile a lot and this watching the charts by zooming with my fingers was a big pain.
* I had to visit different newsites for the latest news.
* I wanted to add alerts on these websites but none supported. Then i checked some apps which lacked functionality but supported alerts.
* I found that there are lot of opportunities for arbitrage but no single website or app shows this in a easy understanding manner.
* I want to maintain my portfolio along with all these things which again was not possible.
 
So I took the matter into my own hands and decided to build an all-in-one app for myself. Along the way i realized that i was not the only person who has been facing such problems and decided to publish it on playstore.
Introducing ACrypto - Cryptocurrency tracker app which has
 
* Basic Price and Volume Charts with more than 20 fiat currencies and 40 exchanges
* Top list of coins in different fiat currencies where you can search and sort and view the details and exchanges
* Cryptocurrency news from different newsites like bitcoinist, 8btc, coindesk, new.bitcoin
* Arbitrage opportunities for top cryptocurrencies in different fiat currencies and where you can buy and sell
* Alerts for Price change and Arbitrage change for all your cryptocurrencies
* Maintain all of your portfolio in a single place
* Advanced Charts with MACD, RSI and other indicators
The app is free to download and will serve all beginners. If you are pro trader then you can subscribe to pro features. This is available for both android and iOS.
 
I'm an Indie developer who is just coded this from my laptop at home. It's only been a very short period, so expect some bugs.  Let me know how I can improve it and would love to take suggestion and feature request from all you guys.
 
Thanks! Hari ([

Crypto Pro is a decent app and ACrypto serves the same need. Few differentiators i would like to point.
* Price Comparison across exchanges
* Arbitrage opportunities
* Alerts for not just price but arbitrage aswell
* Personalised watchlist
We are just getting started. Expect a lot more in the future.

Yes this is in my plan. I'm new to iOS platform, so it will take some time.

I will take this a feature request and will build it in the next version of app. Thanks Mate!

I think i was in a hurry. Will fix it. Thanks Mate!

Thanks man. The biggest differences are are coins List, Arbitrage and arbitrage alerts. Also this is very n00b friendly and easy to use design.

I'm happy that my app has been useful to you. I hope it reaches more and more people and becomes useful to them aswell.

* Not sure how much useful it will be to everyone, filter by volume and price doest the work most of the time. But will try it.
* Yes its tricky, i cant fix it or else where the cents more than 6 decimals will shown as 0.00 or if i fix it 6 decimals then everywhere else it will show 555.600000 which is again very bad. So i will leave it there which works in all cases.
* This is expected behaviour, as volume can be in the coin or in the currency it is traded. In Coins view list you would have chosen USD currency, so thats why you are seeing it in USD. If you have chosen BTC , you would see in BTC.
* Yes got few more feedback on this. Will try to fix this.
Thanks you so much for the feedback. Really appreciate it.
