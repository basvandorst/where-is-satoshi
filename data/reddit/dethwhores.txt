It is an investment. The Libra Investment Token is a Token with voting powers and I believe will be used for staking. Additionally Libra coin will be traded on exchanges. It is not marketed as a stable coin

But bitcoin can be split to the satoshi level. So sure ppl are selling BTC but they can just sell a fraction. So before when 21M BTC had a fiat value of 150B USD now that same 21M BTC has a value of say 1.5T USD. Logically it seems as though Bitcoin just will continue to absorb the value of printed bull shit fiat. I'm struggling to understand what that means. As long as BTC is traded on open market seems like bitcoin just acts as a 'sponge' absorbing up shit fiat. Where does that leave us.

Kinda makes me wonder what properties make an asset a store of value. Obviously something that will at least maintain its value lol. Anything that people believe there will be a market for in the future. Things like artwork or classic cars makes sense to me...but why gold?  I've read analyses that it's around speculation that we will eventually default to gold as a method of payment transactions via tying fiat to gold (i.e. Gold standard) after a global economic collapse. Which it seems people have the same beliefs around bitcoin. So that's the mindset where my op came from.
