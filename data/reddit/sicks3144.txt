I switched from an iPhone 5S to a Nexus 5 a couple of weeks ago and while it wasn't entirely down to the wallet situation, that was a significant factor.
The iPhones are beautifully made; to the extent that - in terms of how the thing feels and looks in your hand - no Android phone really competes. The hardware is exceedingly strong. iOS 7 is, for me, inferior to Kitkat but not by an extent to which it becomes an issue. Both are good, intuitive mobile operating systems.
The App Store is, in many ways, better than the Play Store. The tight moderation which taketh away so readily also giveth a much more refined list of apps. You'd be hard pushed to find the dozens of knock-off apps that plague the Play Store. Of course, the flip side of that coin is that Apple occasionally start moderating the App Store based on practices that aren't really anything to do with their own rules. Jobs decided, seemingly on a whim, that he didn't want "adult themed" apps in there. Apple have somewhat casually but always firmly rejected Bitcoin wallets, often without really specifying why.
Apple do this relying on their brand and very highly thought of product's position. For now, they're safe in doing so; how many iPhone users will follow me in ditching their iPhone for an Android in the wake of this news?

Being brutally honest, isn't that the same logic that certain people use to validate homophobia via the bible? "I feel it's obvious that it's implied" and such?

Your assumption that, because it fails on your box, the build script is "broken" (it's obviously not, since there are plenty of OSX users) shows why the beta is not for you. Don't take that personally, it's just a demonstration of your non-appreciation for the purpose of the beta. That's fine; hopefully you'll do better with the finished product which should require little to no technical knowledge.
If you do decide to investigate further, read through configure.sh (which is the installation "wizard" you speak of), understand what it does - it's surprisingly not complex, to be honest - and figure out what went wrong. Even if it fails, it's not hard to see what it's trying to do.

Again, you're over simplifying to absurd levels.

I hope to god you don't ever declare Linux distros to be different to one another with that mindset, because they're sure as hell more similar than OSX and BSD are today.
As for Windows, obviously that's a distinct product that has no common ancestry with the other major operating systems of today, so I can't even begin to wonder where you'll argue there. It has a GUI, it has filesystems, it has device drivers, TLDR it's indistinguishable from OS/2 other than "branding".

Without wanting to trot out increasingly childish labels, I'm guessing it's borne of the fact that lots of people trumpeted Bitcoin's unregulated existence, then shouted for Karpales and co to be dealt with by regulators as soon as they lost some money.
Even if you despise regulation, you can't deny it has its benefits, just as the regulation lovers can't deny that an unregulated existence has its plusses too.

Don't be silly; GMail doesn't hold my money. Losing access to e-mail is inconvenient, but doesn't stop you paying your bills. Money is **too important** to lose access to in anything less than your nuclear holocaust. Big picture, and all that.


Wut? I didn't criticise piuk at all. Blockchain.info is a great site and he deserves a ton of credit for everything it does, I just think this is an example of why online wallets are - at the most basic level - a flawed idea. One of the _best_ parts of Bitcoin is that finally, you control your own money. Not any centralising body: you. Having an online wallet that can, as Blockchain.info has shown today and yesterday, quickly part you with access to that money. You don't control it any more. What happens when the site is spontaneously bought by Wells Fargo? Best hope you have a recent backup, eh?


Except banks, GMail etc don't have big .. er, big money? coming after them in the coming years. If Megaupload can be taken down by the high cost lawyers, Blockchain.info sure as hell can.
Again, this is not a rant against the Blockchain.info developers or any other e-wallet staff, not in the slightest. I'm just more and more concerned, especially by this proof of vulnerability, that the more online wallets are relied upon, the weaker Bitcoin becomes.

From my own experience, BitPak is fucking terrible (and possibly abandoned). For reasons I've never seen explained (despite frequent asking), the first transaction takes several days - 11 in my case - to show up in the wallet, despite the blockchain being downloaded previously. Closed source + decidedly odd behaviour + a developer unwilling to explain = get the hell out of my money.

Maybe I'm just old fashioned.

I think the fact that Bitcoin theft is _enormously_ difficult if you follow a few basic rules (note that every single major theft made public has the victim wringing their hands and admitting their wallet wasn't encrypted, etc etc) is considerably better for anti-theft purposes than giving that kind of authority to anything.

I've long felt concerned about online wallets, due to the centralisation they bring to a supposedly decentralised currency.

To my (limited) knowledge, Bitcoin is vulnerable once more than 50% of the mining team is under the sway of a single entity. While this entity wouldn't then be able to steal your moneys, they _could_ prevent transactions from being confirmed, which would obviously be a rather big deal. I've probably got the details wrong here, so I'm very much up for being corrected.

2. Follow instructions there for depositing GBP into your account there. Don't be alarmed if your money doesn't instantly appear, they're pulling data from the bank manually at the moment, I gather.
3. Place a buy order (still on Intersango) for Bitcoins. You can see what people are selling at and either meet their price, or set your own and wait for a seller to meet it.
4. When your Bitcoins are purchased, withdraw them to an address of your choice.

My "reaction" (reaction to what?) is to live in the real world, not a twee little fantasy where everyone behaves responsibly and rationally. When you're in a position to inform the public that a nuclear bomb is being aimed at the US, _you_ let us know how much good the ensuing panic did for the people you told.
There's a big, giant, neon-lit reason such things aren't done, and it's not because everyone in a position of power is Dr Evil. It's incredibly naive to think that all information open to the government being in the hands of the public would be a productive move.

Er, no. I'm simply concerned at the prospect of it becoming slightly harder to purchase BTC (second largest exchange disappearing) has caused a noticeable drop in demand for bitcoins, which would imply adoption is slowing. Don't assume.


What on earth is leading besides the implication that the price drop has concerned _me_? Wrong or right, I'm allowed my own views and opinions.


If the second largest exchange is meaningless then I guess we all need another chat about decentralisation.


This and further snippets seem to suggest you've decided that I have invested/lost a large sum of money in Bitcoin. I haven't; **I have spent maybe $30 on Bitcoins**, in an effort to experiment and play with it rather than make money from it. How much have I lost? _Maybe_ the price of a ticket to the movies.
Is this just a case of hitting out at somebody speaking heresy, or did you just make a wild assumption and forgot you had nothing to base it on? You could have, with far less effort than you've already spent, simply said "No, because xyz" and that'd be that. View expressed.

This, surely, is the fundamental flaw with e-wallets. However great the administrators' intentions, however feature-filled they may be, one trip over a cable renders a _lot_ of people temporarily without their coins.
Can you imagine the uproar if a major bank said "No, sorry, we're having some IT problems, so you'll have to wait until later to access the money you trusted us to manage"?
I've been sceptical of online wallets for this and other reasons since first hearing about Bitcoin (why invest in a decentralised currency only to promptly centralise your share?), and this has sadly confirmed my fears mere days after I thought I'd check one out :&lt; Sigh, glad I suggested blockchain's wallet to try and convince a friend to check Bitcoin out.

To avoid starting another topic, if you could kindly indulge me when you (or any other reader) has a moment - explain like I'm 5 ..
* Transaction fees. I gather they're essentially a bribe for miners to process the transaction sooner - is the fee paid by the sender (added onto the amount sent) or the receiver (taken from it)? How does one calculate an "appropriate" transaction fee?
* On a similar note, why would payments have different sizes in terms of kb?
* Confirmations. I have an incoming payment showing up with 1/6 confirmations. What exactly is being confirmed 6 times, practically speaking? Do I "own" the incoming coins at this point, or only after the 6th confirmation?
* Is a block essentially a group of transactions waiting to be added to the blockchain?
* If, say, I sold an item on ebay and was awaiting a BTC payment from the buyer, at what point would I sensibly (i.e. safely without overkill) consider payment received?
Thanks for any guidance offered, I'm fascinated by it all but meandering between excellent and absent documentation.

As I tried to imply, I'm not a statist. I don't, at all, think the state is a one-stop answer for all of society's needs and ills, but I _do_ think that it's a comparatively efficient provider compared to asking today's average Joe to do the same job. It's not the perfect solution (which is something Reddit always wants in any debate, it seems) but it's not useless either. Again: shades of grey.

I'd agree with your first point. In a perfect, probably impractical world, I'd love to be taxed according to what I wanted - cherry-picking as if from a menu.
I'd certainly be happier calling it extortion than slavery. I'm not sure what the alternatives would be, though. For instance, let's say you stop paying the tax that covers street-sweeping. Is it fair that you walk on roads that are only tidy because of others' paying for it? Can you only walk on streets that your private alternative swept? Obviously impractical, so I suspect we'd end up defaulting back to "fuck it, everyone wants this, just centralise it and be done with it" before long.

Few seem to realise that they don't _have_ to kill Bitcoin - they just have to make it enough of a pain to use (e.g. shutting down exchanges, as you said) so as to make sure few enough people can be bothered.

Aren't you doing the same? I live in London, England. Show me a fire service I can employ that at least rivals the state-provided alternative in terms of results and cost. Or a health service. Or a school. Street cleaners? Refuse collection? Any of them will be fine. I understand if it'll take a while, but I'm hoping you can prove your point regarding the options available. Support _your_ assumptions.


Experience. For example, I have _every_ doubt about your success regarding the above. I'll get a kick about of being wrong here, though, for sure.


Let's be honest; you aren't exactly supporting your own arguments here, but happily tell me to do so. Given that my claim is largely based on the **absence** of private, well resourced alternatives to many (no, not all) public services, the burden of proof is on you.

From their Twitter feed, it looks as if it's "undecided" as to whether they'll open the code up. I agree, though, it's dead in the water (for me, at least) until they do so.

Can anyone (authoritatively) comment on the security of Coinbase? Is it on par with blockchain.info?

No, I've tried multiple times and the app refuses to pair with my wallet. The QR code (and yes, I've tried both available QRs) scans and then ... nothing - just a "no data" error (don't you dare ask if I have a data connection). Tried multiple phones, even created a new wallet just in case. Seen several people complain of the same problem.
Edit: What the fuck, Blockchain. I just added a vanity address that I totally don't need and, lo and behold, my wallet will now sync with my mobile app. This has been screwing me about for _months_. Oh well, I guess that's the solution .. somehow.

Yeah, suggesting taxation can have benefits makes evil a perfectly precise concept.
I can't work out if this is worth continuing out of curiosity for your attempts at misinterpretation or not.

It's **comparatively** stable now, but as soon as the next Bitcoin-using company turns out to have never heard of SQL injection, we all know it'll dive again.

I suppose it depends on your definition of abuse, but I would say funds generated from taxation being used for things that a majority of the taxpayers disagree with, or at least consider unnecessary, is such an example.
For example, I expect most people don't have a problem with their taxes paying for waste collection, but are less happy with (random example) a purchase of a £1000 coffee machine for some obscure civil servant's office.
I'd love to see an itemised bill for taxation, so I can see (with as much detail as is feasible) where my money went.

Oh I expect there are ways it can be done, as you say, just that Apple would proactively break it on sight. They don't _want_ such apps and will adjust in order to prevent them. That's the central and, for the foreseeable future, insurmountable problem with wallet apps and iOS for me.

100% genuine, non-snarky question for you: what drives you to post this way? Is it something of a high to hang around in a subreddit you clearly dislike, informing everyone of how much you dislike it?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:14:12


That's remarkably arrogant - should I be surprised? - for a suffix to a comment that looks entirely ignorant of its parent.
Of course there are alternatives. As I said and can only assume you neglected to read, I do not consider the state a one-stop solution. That means, if English is not your first language (fair enough, if so), that I do not consider it the only solution.
I don't consider a state-funded fire truck the only method of putting out fire. I consider it, all things considered, the best way at present. If a private company dedicated to such a task with similar resources and manpower appeared, I'd be more than happy to weigh them up against the existing service, but that's not happened yet.
I'll say it yet another time - you're condescendingly pigeon-holing me as a "statist" because I dare to consider a state-sponsored solution to be a good one, while offering no argument against that point. If you honestly cannot see the difference between my posts and those of someone who thinks the state is the be all and end all, then I really don't know where we go from here.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:01:01
No idea if its popular opinion or not, but I'd get into the habit of including a QR code if you're providing the payment address on paper (as opposed to a copy/paste-able electronic method).
Asking someone to type it out is just asking for trouble via frustration or a typo.
@_date: 2013-03-21 10:44:02
Even if the government operated as a charity with mandatory donations (I know full well this is an oxymoron, jeez) to cover the cost of public services (and no more), certain people would still bitch about being stolen from because, let's be honest, those people don't like paying for things.
Tax in itself isn't a bad thing. The taxation system being abused is, but that's a shade of grey too indistinct for many here.

I've always used Google's:
The chs variable is the size of the resulting image, and chl is the data you want encoded in the QR.
To pay 1BTC to 19w9WxuXA4MVEhzE2pkGVAxgUpGhPfK8tj (and feel free to do so!), you would set chl to (html safe):

I dislike this on principle rather than the practical consequences.
It may or may not be necessary - I'm no expert - but this takes Bitcoin across the "here's something you may not do with your own money" line.

blockchain.info for my "live" wallet (I think of it as the wallet I take on a night out - it has enough to get me through the day, but if it's lost/stolen then it's not too huge a deal) and an encrypted, routinely backed up Bitcoin-QT wallet with the rest.

I'm not saying a sub of nothing but memes is good, but is it really all that great now?
90% of this sub can be summed up as
* Articles that are essentially reposts, perhaps by a different site but saying the same thing/s.
* Questions that have been asked a thousand times ("What do you buy with your bitcoin?")
* Something that amounts to "omg buy buy buy/sell sell sell", usually without base
* The occasional newbie question, which is usually responded to with all the social ability of a portable toilet.
Hardly the shining beacon of content that must be protected at all costs from the evil meme beast.
