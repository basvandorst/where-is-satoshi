I am paid in bitcoin based on dollar based transactions. The dollar amount of the transactions I deal with is a constant; thus the net amount of bitcoin that I am paid each day is higher than it would be if the the price of bitcoin was higher.
I just hope that bitcoin stays below $1000 for at least six more months, though realistically I imagine it will break above that point again before the end of the year.
