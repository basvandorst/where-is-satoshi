Step back and see the big picture.  You're a communist dictator who is using hyperinflation to tax the people.  Do you really think that you are going to allow other people to use a currency that you don't control?  Not likely.
In this case, yes the dictator is allowing other people to use another currency, but he is only allowing it now, when things have gotten so bad.

ah yes, there is a name for that:

Inflation is the theft.  If you have a dollar and it loses value, where did that value go?  It went to the inflators; they stole the value.  The created new money out of the value that they stole from you.  They only steal a little bit at a time from you, just a few percent per year, so people don't really mind too much.

Wallet isn't too bad of a choice.
The real problem is that people use the word to describe multiple things: a wallet file (example: wallet.dat) containing multiple keys, a software program (example: electrum) that manages wallet files, and a single key (example: a paper wallet).

This implies that the actions of miners can affect how many bitcoins exist at any particular time.  The supply at any given particular time is (roughly) fixed by the algorithm.

I'm going to stick to the ideas that turned me into a millionaire.  You can stick to your ideas that kept you a wage slave.

Yes it was.  This is a matter of historical record.  In the genesis block (the very first bitcoin block) Satoshi included the text: 


Note that his pre-implentation of the idea was called "Bitgold", not "Bitdollar".

No.  I could create a bitcoin wallet using dice, pencil, and paper.  I would just need to roll the dice (many, many times) to generate a random number, then use the right math to turn it into a key, and then more math to turn that key into an address.  I could give that address to someone and he could send me money.


Yes.  Transactions can be created offline, but in order to settle they need to be included in the block chain.  The sender publishes the transaction to the network and then miners will include it in a block if the fee is sufficient.

My answer had nothing to do with trading.
But yes, you guessed right; I don't trade.  People who try to time the market are gamblers.  I do not gamble, because the house always wins.  I buy and hold.

This study is nonsense.  Good wallet software sends the change to a new address.  All of my bitcoin is currently in about a dozen addresses, none of which have ever sent an outgoing transaction.

Maybe that should make you rethink *your* views.

Is the borrower claiming that he went to a bank to get a mortgage and the bank just handed him a USB stick with bitcoin?  I'm pretty sure that banks don't do that.
If I understand correctly, you are taking over the borrower's interest in the house, which means that now your bank would have to pay the first bank's mortgage?
Has the borrower been paying the first bank?  Surely there should be documentation.  Is this some sort of mortgage where an individual is taking the role of the bank?
Ok, as for the transfer.  If we are talking about a large amount of money (750 BTC is a lot of money now, it wasn't 8 years ago), then the recipient of the bitcoins would have wanted to keep them safe.
If I hand you a USB wallet I'm also going to have a copy somewhere on my computer until I delete it.  The wallet contains keys which allow bitcoins to be spent.  The bitcoins aren't in the wallet, they are everywhere on the internet.  The keys allow you to spend them.  So when you copy a wallet and give it to someone it is now jointly controllable.  In such a situation it would be foolish for the borrower to not move the coins to a wallet that only he controls.
So, if this is real, here is what I could expect to see on the bitcoin block chain:
1) One (or maybe a few) transactions moving the coins to an address.  This address's key would be in the wallet.  This event would probably happen shortly before the mortgage transaction.  There is a small chance that it could be months or years earlier though, because maybe that's how many bitcoins the guy had lying around and he gave them all to the borrower.
2) One physical transaction in which the usb stick is handed over.
3) One bitcoin transaction moving the coins from that address to another address (or maybe a few).  The new address(es) would be under the complete control of the borrower.  This event would happen shortly after the mortgage transaction, ideally the day of the transaction or later.
4) perhaps additional bitcoin transactions if the coins are spent or sold
Bitcoin transactions are all recorded in the block chain, which is public.  Physical transactions are not, unless someone has a video camera record it.  Moving exactly 750 coins at once is pretty rare and would probably be pretty easy to find in the block chain, especially if you know the date.

The r/btc moderators are blaming their split on our subreddit and our moderator "theymos".
They also claim that they may need to move to another platform in order to be able to censor dissenters.  Why not just ban people from their subreddit?  That would go against their subreddit's self-imposed policy of non-censorship.  So rather than change the policy, they want to fork off to a new platform where they will set a new policy.

What if the US government introduced a coin called the "mill" that was one tenth of a cent?  Would that cause the value of a dollar to suddenly collapse?  No, nothing would change.
