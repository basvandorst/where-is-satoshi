great! You'll have to wait for the blockchain to completely download, but as long as you have a backup of the old wallet.dat, you are safe.

ok, this means there's still hope! I think the problem is we downloaded a different version of pywallet! You need to replace the pywallet.py we put in c:\pywallet\ last time, with the one contained in this other [.zip file](
Now you can run the same command as before, this time it should work. At this point you can import the output to [blockchain.info]( as explained before.
....let me know:)

ok...assuming you correctly installed python in the default directory, try to use this command in ms-dos prompt: "c:\Python27\python c:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfolder\ --dumpwallet"

Wow, you are the 3rd person suggesting me meditation in last month. At this point I really have to give it a try.

Try to use your old backup from march as your wallet.dat. If it doesn't work, try the following:
1) take a deep breath
2) Install Python 2.7 from [here](
3) Install [Twisted for Py2.7]( then Zope.Interface for Py2.7 [here](
4)make a BACKUP copy of your wallet.1387207244.bak corrupted file, rename it as wallet.dat and place it in, let's say, C:\yourbkpfolder\
5) download this [.zip]( and copy pywallet.py in C:\pywallet\
6) Start&gt;Run&gt; type "cmd", OK
7) you shoul see an msdos prompt now. Type the following: "python C:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfolder\ --dumpwallet"
8) You should have another wallet file in C:\pywallet\ now (or maybe in C:\users\your_username\). Copy that to bitcoin client installation directory and cross fingers;)

I discovered bitcoins in november 2011. My biggest regret is that I took the advice not to invest in them from my dad and older people. I linstened to them *just because they were older*. But even back in 2011 I already had all the necessary knoweledge in crypto and p2p to understand the paper and invest in BTC *all by myself*. I didn't, because 1) I lacked in economics experience and 2) I was lazy.
Hope the future me will remember this lesson.
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:16:23
I really hope so. At the moment, here in Italy, my generation is mostly jealous of the previous one. Hope we can fix this world before giving it to my future kids;)

@_date: 2013-03-25 20:53:05
ok. I think that the easiest thing that you can try to do now is this: go to [blockchain.info]( -&gt; cklick "wallet" -&gt; "start a new wallet". Once you created a wallet, go to "Import / Export", select "import wallet" from the left menu, and paste in the provided text area that "long stream of text" you get from executing that command we tried before. Click "import wallet". If everything goes right, you'll se your wallet amount in your browser. That means your wallet is recovered and you can easily send all your btc to a local wallet or do wathever you want. Let me know if it works.
@_date: 2013-03-26 09:18:41
ok this seems to be serius...are you sure you didn't encrypt you wallet.dat with a password? in that case the right command is "c:\Python27\python c:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfolder\ --dumpwallet --password=yourPassword"
another possible thing you can try: Start&gt;run&gt; type "cmd"&gt; type this: "explorer %APPDATA%\Bitcoin"
a directory will open. Replace the wallet.dat you see there with your corrupted wallet.dat, then restart the bitcoin application. 
If it still doesn't work, you can now try start&gt;run&gt;"C:\Program Files\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe" -salvagewallet
Let me know!

Is it just me or the addon disappeared from Mozilla.org? The litecoin one is still there though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:52:09
Grazie a te!;)
@_date: 2013-03-29 10:02:46
Most likely your password is wrong. If you know that part of the password is right but can't remember the whole string, you can try to bruteforce it, but it isn't an easy thing to do, you may have to ask someone you trust for help. Just remember that anyone who sees your private key has total control of your wallet, so take care.

I'd keep the english version because that's what WIF stands for. Anyway a shorter italian version would be "Formato import portafogli".
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:33:54
perfect! Hope it will help spreading the word about bitcoins in italy...

assuming you use windows:
 
1) Install Python 2.7 from [here](
2) Install [Twisted for Py2.7]( then Zope.Interface for Py2.7 [here](
3)make a BACKUP copy of your wallet.dat corrupted file and place it in, let's say, C:\yourbkpfolder\

Here's Italian (native Italian speaker here):
    1)INDIRIZZO PUBBLICO
    2)DEPOSITA / VERIFICA
    3)CHIAVE PRIVATA / PRELEVA
    4)WIF - WALLET IMPORT FORMAT (Formato per l'importazione dei portafogli) 
    5)PORTAFOGLIO CARTACEO
    6)Per depositare altri fondi su questo portafoglio cartaceo, invia bitcoins al suo indirizzo pubblico, in qualsiasi momento.
    7)Puoi verificare il saldo cercando l'indirizzo pubblico su un servizio tipo blockchain.info.
    8)NON ESPORRE LA CHIAVE PRIVATA se non per importare immediatamente il contenuto del portafoglio su un client bitcoin, un exchange o un portafoglio online.
    9)Se prelevi i fondi depositati su questo portafoglio, ti consigliamo di prelevare l'INTERO IMPORTO depositato. Se cerchi di spendere i fondi solo in parte, probabilmente perderai i bitcoins residui.
    10)Domande? Visita bitcoinpaperwallet.com
    11)Importo depositato
    12)Note
    13)Data
Let me know if you need more!

Speaking about your first question, I think [this thread]( is a good place to get started.
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:56:08
Your private key with all the coins you mined is in that wallet.dat file. Backup that on a usb stick before doing anything else.
You need to reinstall your bitcoin client, and then put the old wallet.dat in your bitcoin data directory, (C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin)
Then run the bitcoin client with the -rescan option.
Good luck!

A Raspberry Pi is $35. It's 2013 and people *remotely* tip other people for the equivalent of a *desktop pc*, using a *decentralized digital currency*. Wow.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:48:16
if you already replaced pywallet.py with the new one, here's the procedure:
1) Start&gt;run&gt; type "cmd"&gt; type "c:\Python27\python c:\pywallet\pywallet.py --datadir=C:\yourbkpfolder\ --dumpwallet --password=
2) now go to [blockchain.info]( -&gt; click "wallet" -&gt; "start a new wallet". Once you created a wallet, go to "Import / Export", select "import wallet" from the left menu, and paste in the provided text area that "stream of text" you get from executing the command before in the dos prompt. Click "import wallet". If everything goes right, you'll se your wallet amount in your browser. That means your wallet is recovered and you can easily send all your btc to a local wallet or do wathever you want.
Sorry for the delay with answers, I'm in Italy:)

Your private key with all the coins you mined is in that wallet.dat file. Backup that on a usb stick before doing anything else.
The you need to reinstall your bitcoin client, and put the old wallet.dat in your bitcoin data directory, the default for Windows is:
C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application data\Bitcoin (XP)
C:\Users\YourUserName\Appdata\Roaming\Bitcoin (Vista and 7)
Then run the bitcoin client with the -rescan option.
Good luck!
