You don't need to tell any technical stuff. Tell how does it look like to the user. 
  - There are coins that can't be copied, there is limited number of bitcoin slowly distributed to 'miners'.
  - Anybody can create bitcoin address.
  - Anybody can send coins to that address.
  - There are no 'cashbacks' in simple transfer (although a third party could provide such functionality).
  - Only person that can send coins from address is address' creator. This is enforced through private key file and password.
  - All this is enforced by mathematics and cryptography, not by trust to some central entity like bank.
Bitcoin value:
  - Its usefulness is that (even international) transfers are done within minutes without significant fees and any third party.
  - Limited number of coins promises that there will never be a hyper-inflation (no third party printing more money).
  - Like gold, the value is determined by supply and demand.
  - Currently large scale trading on exchanges determines monetary value.
 - Semi-anonymity of transfers.
 - Transparency of transfers.
Semi-anonymity vs transparency:
 - Anybody can create an address anonymously .
 - All transfers are public.
 - It is not possible 'silently' transfer bitcoins if we know to whom the addresses belong.
  - Bitcoin seller or buyer transfer respectively bitcoins or  currency to an exchange account similar to Forex or Bank.
  - Exchange matches BUY/SELL offers exactly the same as stock market of currency exchange.
  - Exchange takes commission.
  - If hacker can obtain both private key file and password, he can control the address (move bitcoin to his own address).
  - Hacker might steal exchange's private keys / password.
  - Hacker might trick exchange automated software transferring bitcoins to him. (e.g. MtGox).
Disruptiveness / summary:
 -   It is disruptive system because it competes with bank transfers, PayPal-like payment systems and credit union on probably very valuable market of money transfer.  
 - It also competes with gold, normal currency, bank saving accounts on valuable market of store value.

Split your key using 'secret sharing' and store in n independant locations (deposit boxes).
Even if you lose (n-k) of them you can reconstruct the key.

If there is enough incentive for somebody *and* it is possible then it might happen, yes.  
I asking in this post whether it is possible and why not. Given that I'm investing in the system I believe it is a legitimate question to ask.


By formally verified I've mean specification and proof in proof assistant like [Isabelle]( or [Coq](

The high prize does not mean you can sell a large amount of bitcoins that expensive. For instance now selling 6k bitcoins that were bought at 150$ wall breaking would drop the price to 145$. It's possible that it would be loss even though the price is high now.  
This is what means that market is shallow.

This can mean several things. It could be a buyer that wanted to buy a large amount of bitcoins at low (in his opinion) price (good) at last moment. It could also be someone who does not care that much about 1M$ but cares about future of bitcoin (very good).   
But it could be a speculant who is doing it for few months already, planning to sell it enmasse soon with profit.  
You never know.

Now dump of 20k BTC would cause instant drop by 10$ , the resulting panic would make it bigger.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:00:47
Somebody (maybe several people) just bought 6k bitcoins in 20 minutes just to break the 149$ and 150$ walls. That's unnatural.   
Such a purchase now would send the prices to 170$ (instead of 2$).
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:11:50
Would such cashout of 10k BTC be able to drop the price so much ?
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:02:52
Note the huge purchases designed to buy out the 149$ and 150$ walls within 20 minuts.
