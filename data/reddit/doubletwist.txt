Or if you want a real one.

I would tell you, "Cool. Me too."

I was going to say, for him it's basically the same as the $40/month I've been buying for the last couple years.

Maybe think if it as the date of conception vs the date of birth.

I'm looking to trade US dollars. I'm looking for a place I can buy some at a 10-25% reduction in price...

My Prediction: Bitcoin will be $874.56 in 2017!

Will you be horribly upset if someone in Antarctica starts mining?

I only did $0.75/day ($20 on the 1st &amp; 15th). I I'll be honest, I haven't calculated out the results.

True. But if that's enough to stop people from spending Bitcoin, then the IRS (in the US at least) has effectively killed Bitcoin as a currency unless we can get that rule changed.

Really the community needs to stop using "hodl" and start using "spend and replace" or something more reflective of what needs to happen for Bitcoin to succeed in the long term. 
If people new to the community keep seeing everyone talking about holding, then that's what the new people are going to do, and in that situation, best case Bitcoin becomes just a mindless holder of value (like gold) and worst case (and maybe more likely) has a short rise based on "irrational exuberance" of people thinking it's just a way to make money when they cash in, in which case it will eventually reach a point of saturation and will fail exactly like a pyramid scheme. NOTE: I'm not calling Bitcoin a pyramid scheme but if we aren't careful it could have the same end as one. 
I think for Bitcoin to succeed as a currency, the community needs to be serious about emphasising that aspect of it.

Um. The people who are writing and/or using ransomware are, by definition, terrorists.

And it's great for coinstar, because they can double dip on fees.

Oh,I see. I must have forgotten to carry the one... ��

This was my first time seeing your summary and I found it very useful as is.

I didn't trust it either and planned on waiting until it showed up in the play store. Even though I only keep about $50 worth on my mobile wallet, I'd rather not lose even that to a shady looking upgrade.

This right here. I think my last two purchased have been Humble bundles. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:56:19
Thank you. That was my first thought too. "Wouldn't it be nicer to ask them to consider it?"
@_date: 2015-10-10 15:25:58
No actually, I didn't even think about that until I saw your post.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:13:44
I've used it to buy Soylent and to pay for Humble Bundles.
