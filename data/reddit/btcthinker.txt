The most frequent error tech people (software engineers) tend to make, when it comes to working on something Bitcoin-related, is to think that Bitcoin is just like any other technology. That sets off a chain of very painful experiences for anybody that wants to "dabble" in a Bitcoin-related venture. The main reason is that any Bitcoin-related venture is not merely a technology venture (which is difficult on its own), but it's also a Fin Tech venture. Why does this matter? Well, anything to do with money is heavily regulated in just about every country which you'd want to deploy your product in.
Therein lies the entire problem for software engineers who want to "build something to help Bitcoin." Unwittingly, they stray into Fin Tech, completely unprepared for the reality of it. There are very few projects related to Bitcoin which are purely tech, so when you're looking to dive into anything of the sort, the first thing you want to do is to **very carefully** consider what you're getting yourself into. If you don't have experience in Fin Tech, then make sure that you start making friends in that space, otherwise you're simply not going to have a good time.

There will always be bitcoins to transact with. If the Winklevoss brothers want to actually live, they'd have to buy food, water, electricity, internet service, phone service, gas for their cars, jet fuel for their Lear jets and uranium for nuclear plant powering their aircraft carrier. All of that means that they will be spending bitcoins and you'll have the ability to earn bitcoins by either running a business which provides those services to the Winklevoss brothers or working for people that run those businesses. You, in turn, will either pay your employees in bitcoins or you will be getting paid in bitcoins. Everybody that owns a bitcoin is thus a part of the bitcoin economy and they'd acquire and spend their bitcoins as anybody normally would.

That's not why gold is obsolete. The governments may have moved away from the use of gold, but if it was really superior to cash it would have replaced cash over time. Gold, as a means of exchange, is not outlawed for people. Gold is obsolete because our economy is a lot more global these days and it's simply not as efficient to use gold as a means of exchange. This is particularly evident with the current information technology age: paying Amazon or eBay auctions with gold is hardly a reasonable thing to look forward to.

This idea simply won't work without driving the price up. Miners and mining pools are a major supplier on the market: if you take them out by directly buying from them, then the market demand will go up. Selling "some" on the market will not offset the shortage due to the BTC which were purchased from the miners and the price will remain high. The miners and mining pool operators will not sell to the government at less than market price.
Early adopters are holding long term and if somebody gets in touch with them to sell, then the offer will have to be substantially above the market price. Again, not going to work without affecting the market price.

The consumer certainly wins:
1. They don't have to send their financial information to Overstock.com just to purchase a set of pillows, that's a win ANY day!
2. They don't have to worry about ID theft or fraudulent charges due to Overstock's incompetence (if there is any).
3. They can pay for the item as anonymously as they want to.
4. They can pay from any country in the world with an internet connection, regardless if they're a part of the banking system or not.
Overstock saves on transaction fees, chargebacks, money spent on securing financial data and complying with laws about storage of financial data. This gets passed onto the consumer as well.
Win all around!

It's not anonymous because you connect directly to the end node. 
Venus Fly Trap:
If you're in a shitty country where watching dirty movies is illegal and you're buying a movie, then you can easily get caught if the cops setup a Venus Fly Trap. In other words, they run the end node and they're advertising that they're selling the dirty movie. You connect to them, they get your IP, you place the order and next thing you know, you're sitting in jail because you wanted to watch a dirty movie.
Punctuation is important, e.g.: 
"what you mean you were raped as a child"  
"what you mean? you were raped as a child?"  
"what? you mean you were raped as a child?"  
"what you mean: you were raped as a child"  
"what you mean, you were raped as a child."

Initially I thought that OpenBazaar uses the block-chain to publish the sale of an item, but [after reading up on it]( it's just a distributed network of nodes. This is a reason for concerned now: it seems that whenever you want to have a transaction with somebody, you issue a command to find the node and conduct the transaction directly. This is not very good, because if you're trying to avoid a draconian authority, then you're SOL. For example, the some gestapo-type-of government organization could be running a "Venus Fly Trap" on the other end you'll be communicating directly with them. That means that they'll know your identity right off the bat. Ideally they should route the encrypted traffic to the destination node, therefore protecting the identity of the source node.
Of course if you want to provide anonymity, you can always fork the code, implement encrypted traffic routing (or any other anonymity solution) and now you'll have a distributed anonymous market. WIN!
Conclusion: it's just like a Torrent, you do connect to the peer node directly, you just find it indirectly :).

This is the part where I disagree. I saw that MtGox was an exchange that couldn't service my needs and I moved to one that could (BitStamp). However, many family and friends of mine, who bought some Bitcoins and left them on the exchange, really didn't see the need to move. After all, they were in it for the long run, they aren't particularly technical and leaving the BTC at the exchange was the easiest solution for them.
Frankly, ALL of the major exchanges were hit with DDOS attacks last year. ALL of the exchanges were affected by the malleability issue. The difference was that MtGox was simply more incompetent in every step of the way than all of the other exchanges, but they always managed to squeeze by. This would have been obvious to anybody who was following the news closely, but to others who simply bought some BTC and left them in MtGox for the long run, this wasn't particularly obvious.
All those people do have a functional cognitive apparatus, but they simply aren't involved in the community as much as others.

It's all about SUPPLY and DEMAND. People that have bitcoin have to eat food, drink water, wear clothes, put a roof over their head, talk on the phone, connect to the internet, drive a car, go on vacation, etc. That means that they will WILLINGLY spend their bitcoins and that gives you an opportunity to acquire it from them. The people who own a business which accepts bitcoins will be RELATIVELY rich too, the people that work for them and get paid in bitcoin will get a chance to live a middle-class lifestyle.
Supply and demand will continue to allow people to earn bitcoins and a reasonable exchange rate. So if a bitcoin costs a 100K, then a 50k car costs 1/2 a BTC, a 1k laptop costs 0.01 BTC and a $5 lunch costs 0.00005 BTC. So why would you need to acquire a single bitcoin worth the same as your house if you can cover your monthly expenses with 0.05 BTC? All you need to do is work or provide enough services to earn 0.05 BTC per month.

What could motivate the currently rich people to lose their money? Lack of foresight. Frankly, we can't really say if they deserve to lose it or if they will lose it at all, but it's certain that if they stay on the fiat system they will lose a substantial amount of their buying power. However, they're not stupid so they will start accepting Bitcoin and they'll continue to make money off whatever they're doing. The oil rich Arab countries will still be rich even if they're getting paid with Bitcoin.


First and foremost, your assumption is that people HAVE to trade their cash for Bitcoins. They can simply get a salary in Bitcoin, their business can earn income in Bitcoin or they can provide some services for Bitcoin. In any case, once they own some Bitcoins (or fractions of a Bitcoin) there are many benefits to them:
1. They become a part of a financial system that encourages saving, not borrowing.
2. They have as much privacy with regards to their transactions as they want.
3. People become independent of their government's monetary policy.
4. They have the freedom to transact with anybody in the world without any limits.
5. The value of their net worth will generally go up over time.
6. People become more educated about financial freedom and independence, which is a paradigm shift.
There are many more benefits to Bitcoin, one can hardly enumerate them all here.

Yah, so there is a major bug in the ATM: if you're buying BTC, there is a super simple way to make the ATM eat your money.
The ATM simply has to have a low BTC balance. When the user attempts to buy more BTC than what's currently available, the ATM asks for the user to display the QR code where the BTC should be sent. When you show the QR code, the ATM says there is an error and that you should scan your QR code again... you can keep scanning all day long, but it will keep coming back with the same error. Eventually the transaction will time out and it will tell you that it will print a receipt (and a paper wallet), but it doesn't. I'm talking to the support people.
The way this should be fixed is that the bill recycler should reject the bill if the inserted amount exceeds the BTC balance of the ATM.

It's simple market phenomenon: as the liquidity increases, the volatility decreases. Furthermore, when something is widely accepted, there are a huger number of people who have a stake in its success, thus it tends to become more stable rather than to destabilize. There are about 5 million people using Bitcoin, 30k merchants, thousands of miners, and several thousand companies building infrastructure in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Thus there are A LOT of people with an interest in Bitcoin's success.

1. Bitcoin may be volatile, but as liquidity increases the volatility will decrease. Furthermore, the consumer can hold it as long as they feel comfortable with it (1 hour, 1 day, 1 year, 10 years...).  
2. Bitcoins are a lot less likely to be stolen from the consumer's computer than they are from a 3rd party which holds a lot of BTC. The point of Bitcoin is that people shouldn't need a 3rd party to hold their BTC.  
3. Plausible deniability- anybody can ship something to your house.  
4. Oh... wait... [yes, you can]( )!
The consumer can purchase BTC for as low as 0.5%. Consumers can hold the BTC and watch the value increases 10 to 100 fold (it's happened in the past)! Bitcoin's price trend is quite positive, it's outperformed just about every financial asset out there in the last 4 years and in the last 1 year. For the last 2 months it hasn't had a price drop at all, as a matter of fact it has been pretty stable around 450. For the other 90% of the time Bitcoin has been in existence, the price has been going up! See how easy it is?

Well, if the US bankers did what was done in Bulgaria, then they would have gone to jail *for a really long time*. They had to make the scheme very complicated, because the US is a lot more market oriented and there are a lot of competing interests. When there are competing interests, then it's harder to get away with simple schemes.
The benefit in Bulgaria is that the system is *infinitely* more corrupt, so much less intelligent people can get away with plain theft just by coughing up enough money to the government officials.
Let's put it this way: Bulgaria is the Illinois of Europe (roughly in size, population and relative corruption). The difference is that 4 of the last 7 Illinois Governors have gone to prison, but none of the Bulgarian politicians have gone to prison.

They saw how sub-prime mortgages were used to steal money in 2008 and they wanted in on the action, but they're clearly not as smart as the US bankers. Instead of giving out real loans and having some complex financial products to cover their tracks, they just gave out fake ones and pocketed the money.

There has been an [on-going debate about the terminology]( associated with bitcoin. Mining is a bit of a misnomer, it's more like bookkeeping. So "mining" is just the process of verifying bitcoin transactions for which the "miner" gets rewarded some bitcoins. Without "miners," bitcoin will not be able to operate because there will be nobody verifying and adding transactions to the public ledger. It's like pulling the plug on the bank and trying to send wire transfers.
@_date: 2012-12-25 13:07:46
Yah, it's somewhat pointless to use MtGox via Tor. I don't know what you gain from hiding your identity from MtGox, since once you've purchased your bitcoins (which is very difficult to do anonymously if you start with fiat $) you can easily anonymize them by running them through several bitcoin wallets or a mixing service. After that you're going to be on the dark side and nobody can track you, unless you do something to expose yourself. Good luck!
@_date: 2012-12-24 02:57:35


 
-- OK, so let me step back a bit and clarify. Bitcoin is a protocol which requires people to "mine" (verify transactions) in order for other people to be able to send bitcoins. The protocol states that there will be a maximum of about 21 million bitcoins released in the process of verifying transactions (mining) with the goal of:
1. Creating the initial supply of bitcoins. &lt;-- **this is a major point and it's the reason why bitcoins are "created out of thin air"**
2. Allowing people to transfer value via bitcoins. &lt;-- we need  to do  (no poop jokes plz)
Note that the miners don't give the bitcoin to themselves, the bitcoin release "mechanism" is built into the protocol. And it's a distributed protocol, so it's the community (i.e. people currently using bitcoin) that actually awards the miners with bitcoins out of "thin air". The miners don't have any control of the bitcoin release process, all they can do is just mine (verify transactions) as fast as they can and hope that they get the reward (usually the person with the fastest computer will get the most rewards). This reward gets cut in half periodically, so it initially started with 50 bitcoins, now it's 25, next cycle it will be 12.5 and so on until the reward approaches zero. Then you might wonder "why would anybody continue mining when the reward approaches 0?"... well, read on:
Making bitcoin transactions is fairly fast and it's free, but it can still take about an hour to verify your transaction. If you want to expedite your transaction, you can pay a small fee and your transaction will get a higher priority for verification. The miner that verifies your transaction will get the fee.
Now, the assumption is that when the reward is reaching 0, the value of each bitcoin will be so large that even the small transaction fees would be valuable enough to merit the continued mining. It's a gradual and predictable process, so that allows the community to develop.
So at the end of the day the only job miners will have, when the 21 million is reached, is to verify transactions and collect transaction fees. Note that the idea will be that the bitcoin community will become very large, there will be a lot of transactions coming through and people will want to send their money faster, so there will be a natural tendency for them to pay a little extra for their transaction to be processed faster. In essence, you can think of it as a distributed wire-transfer service.
@_date: 2012-12-24 10:34:41


On a fundamental level, the point of solving the mathematical puzzle is to verify transactions. The details behind it, some of which you've mentioned, are merely describe the technical process involved in the verification.


Despite the fact that at some point the 21 million bitcoins will be "mined," the need for miners will continue to exist because users can expedite transactions with a small transaction fee. If miners don't exist, then there is nobody to verify transactions and the bitcoin network grinds down to a complete halt because the transactions cannot be processed.

If bitcoin becomes large enough, then the function of the banks will start to diminish significantly, IMHO. What would the banks be doing with bitcoin at that point? If people are receiving their salaries in bitcoins, then why would anyone need a bank to run their bitcoin transaction? 
Furthermore, I think that people will develop banking-type services which are built around bitcoin way before the banks get a chance to adapt. The result will be similar to what happened with the smartphones and RIM: people will eventually just switch over to the new technology (bitcoin) and forget about the old (banks) as if it never existed.
Lastly, the point of bitcoin is that people will be able to exchange money without the banks and this will be a key feature for a large online retailer like Amazon. They will certainly be threatened by change requests that could compromise their business, so they're likely to oppose them quite vigorously.

The founding of bitcoin is anything but anonymous. There was [Satoshi's white paper]( of course Satoshi is anonymous, but everything else that followed after that is not. People looked at the white paper, liked what they saw and implemented the protocol as an open-source project. Mostly everybody involved with the project is publicly accessible. However, our culture has a tendency to idolize people who have good ideas, so they keep trying to figure out who to idolize for this great invention... don't bother!


Another irrelevant point: the availability of exchanges has very little to do with whether or not bitcoin is a good medium of exchange. For that we need to look at the [number of bitcoin transactions which occur daily]( as of today it's about 32k transactions and the transaction volume amounts to about 370,943 BTC or $5,044,824. This means that people exchange $5 million worth of goods/services/currency for bitcoin every day, which wouldn't be occurring if it wasn't a good medium of exchange.


I'd chuck that into the not so obvious frictions bucket. If you want to do bitcoin arbitrage you have to look at many things:
* Transaction costs: not just of transferring bitcoins, but transferring the money needed to begin arbitrage. 
* Trade volume of the exchanges where you want to do arbitrage: if the exchange has low trading volume, then why even bother trying to do arbitrage there? Of course, if you look for arbitrage opportunities between high volume exchanges, you will find very few (if any).
* Bid/Ask spread: if you look at the last closing price you might think there is an arbitrage opportunity, but the bid/ask spread on both exchanges may not provide an arbitrage opportunity.
* Finally: if you see an arbitrage opportunity, then take it instead of talking about it :)... it's free money!


A bit of a redundancy, no? Bitcoin's success in the face of improbability is an amazing story, after all, nobody is amazed in with the success of things that are highly probable. Or perhaps the OP is amazed every time an apple falls to the ground due to gravity (the highly probably event).

If some person does gain a significant amount of authority or corrupts a person with a significant amount of authority, then it's still going to be difficult to introduce backdoor code. The primary reason is that the code is open sourced, so it's going to be difficult to get such code in without somebody noticing and raising the alarm. Furthermore, the only thing that can get compromised is the actual client; however, there are plenty of other clients that will continue to operate according to the protocol. The result is that there may be an issue for the users of the particular client, but the network will continue to operate.
Introducing a fault within the protocol is another way, but this is going to be even more difficult because people do take notice of the changes in the protocol and they will only abide by them if they make sense. For example: if there is a fault in the protocol, but the developers of the clients notice the issue, then they're probably not going to implement support for the faulty protocol. Most client developers are very unlikely to introduce patches to support protocol changes which could compromise the network.

I don't think anybody did a real ELI5 here:
~~Replace-by-fire makes double-spending a 0-conf transaction, with the intent of theft, completely pointless. A thief tries to double-spend a 0-conf transaction, the merchant sees that and issues a transaction with a higher fee. The thief sees this and decides to double-spend again, but he'd have to issue a transaction with a higher fee than the merchant's. The merchant and the thief keep doing this until the fee consumes the entire transaction. The merchant gets nothing, miner gets the full transaction amount as a fee, the thief still gets the product, but the thief doesn't get his money back. So the thief has absolutely nothing to gain in that situation: he still ends up paying the same amount.~~

The safety testing is mandated so users can make informed decisions about the risks associated with each vehicle. If you want to buy a shoddy car, you can still do it. However, if you want to spend $100K on a Tesla with a 5-star rating, then you can too.


I'm saying that without proper regulation, the companies will focus on the lowest denominator with disregard for bigger issues (such as the air we breathe). If you want to see what the world would look like without stricter regulation on car manufacturers, then go to China and look at the smog cities. Again, simple observation can tell you that it's not economically sound to allow cars manufacturers to sell cars which pollute the air... because polluted air leads to some really expensive health issues :). This would raise the cost of health care for everybody, even if they chose to drive a safer car. Then we are back to the original problem of health care.


Because you don't live in a silo. Tomorrow it can be you or your child that's got the shitty genetics, and you might not even realize it today. When that happens, you'd be in quite a bit of trouble if you can't afford the health care. At that stage you're either going to ask society to help you, or suffer the deadly consequences. We, as intelligent beings, can assess the risk and the cost of offsetting the risk (through health insurance). The risk is sufficiently high and the cost is sufficiently low for each person that it makes sense to participate in an insurance pool where the cost is distributed. With health care being so expensive, the person refusing to participate in the insurance pool is necessarily harming those around him/her.

RBF actually makes double-spending attempts completely pointless. Here is /user/KayRice and /user/luke-jr's combined TLDR:


Since the miner gets the payment, the fraudster does not get it back. **Therefore, the fraudster has no reason to ever attempt the double spend.**~~  
Please ignore: luke-jr's CPFP (child pays for parent) will not be included in this Bitcoin Core, so the comment above is inaccurate.
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:23:51


On what grounds? According to you, everybody has the right to freedom of association and you've agreed to associate with a car manufacturer which does not do safety testing. And if we had your system in place, then no government body is requiring safety testing, so it's your fault for choosing a shitty car.  


Not really... it's not their fault you chose a shitty car. They're quite clear about the fact that they don't do safety testing. You still chose to use their product.  


I think we all know that the exact opposite is true, given the recent VW fiasco. 
But back on topic: the fact is that genetics have a massive influence on health and society realizes that nobody is exempt, thus the logical conclusion for "distribution of risk".

I was with you half way in there, and then towards the end you totally lost me. Health insurance companies were not denying people coverage, because they lied about their preexisting conditions- they were denying people simply for having a preexisting condition. Even if you told the insurance about the preexisting condition, they would still deny you. Of course, covering preexisting conditions is more expensive and it cuts into their profits, so if another insurance company was not providing coverage for preexisting conditions, then it was easy to say that it would hurt your business. The regulation leveled the playing field and it guaranteed that all health insurance providers had to eat up the cost. Frankly, there wasn't much to eat up, since the law also got a lot more healthy people to pay for insurance. If they want to lower the cost of health care, then they should invest in preventative care: encouraging exercising, promoting healthy foods, and preventative medical screenings.

Instead of allowing its people to take advantage of the innovative technology and encourage growth, the corrupt state system is only interested in preserving the oligarchy.

I don't think he explained it well. There are 3 parties involved:
1. The victim.  
2. The trader.  
3. The scammer.  
The trader usually sells BTC and she gets paid via a bank deposit. She places her BTC into an escrow service, somebody deposits the funds into her bank account, the trader confirms the deposit, and the funds are released from escrow. This is a really safe way to sell BTC.  
Here is what the victim is doing: he sees a really good deal online and he's hooked in somehow. Once the victim is on the hook, he's given payment instructions to a bank account, which is not the scammer's bank account. But wait... **somebody else's bank account**? How does the scammer get the money then?  
Simple: once the victim is ready to make a deposit, the scammer opens a trade with the trader. In some cases, they might open the trade with a good markup on the BTC, so they're sure they'll find a trader. When the trader gives them the deposit instructions, they simply forward the information to the victim. The victim deposits the funds into the trader's account, the trader gives the BTC to the scammer and the scammer disappears.  
The net result: the trader is holding stolen property, the victim has not received the product and the scammer has washed their stolen money.  
In this case, the plaintiff on Judge Judy is the victim and the defendant is the trader. Unfortunately, the trader didn't clearly explain the situation and it subsequently resulted in him looking like a fool. He's still in possession of stolen property, but he really had no way of knowing that. Of course, if he knew about it, then he might be criminally liable.

The problem is that human health is heavily influenced by genetics. What you're essentially saying is that everybody is responsible for their own genetics, and they should live with the economic consequences. Of course, we know that genetics are a very complex and are easily outside of the individual's control. Therefore, it's everybody's best interest to spread the cost of such risk among everybody. So there is nothing illegal about requiring health insurance companies to account for such risk. 
And this is not the only sector of society where we mandate certain things of corporations. If that was not the case, then drug companies would be free to associate only with customers who don't want FDA approved drugs, and car companies would be free to associate only with customers who don't want their cars to pass minimum safety tests. Sure, if you chose the shitty car with the explosive gas tank, then it's your fault... but did you really think that the gas tank was explosive, given that the car wasn't properly tested and nobody knew about it until your family had burned to death?

That's wholly different. If I launch the gold into outer space or if I dump it in a nuclear reactor, you will NEVER get access to it again. If you lose your private key, then you will never get access to your Bitcoins. So yah, there are some conditions under which you can lose access, but ultimately as long as the Internet exists and there is a copy of the ledger somewhere out there, then the Bitcoins still exits.

The usefulness of speculators without the ability to short Bitcoin is diminished quite a bit. Everybody knows that right now Bitcoin is overpriced, eventually there will be a correction (nobody knows how big), but Bitcoin will recover from it just fine.
BTW, I know that some exchanges allow shorting, but not the major ones like MtGox and Bitstamp. The major exchanges need to start allowing margin trading so people can short Bitcoin in order to have better price discovery. Simply having it on a few small volume exchanges is not enough.

It all depends on the merchant: if the merchant can handle the volatility, then yay for no transaction fees. However, if a merchant doesn't like the Bitcoin volatility, then they can mitigate the risk by using a payment processor. What's wrong with having choices? That's the ultimate benefit: **freedom to choose**.

Remember, PayPal is a payment processor just like BitPay: they take BTC and they give USD. PayPal does not pay the sellers in BTC, so they can still perform a charge-back: PayPal receives a Bitcoin transaction (which can't be charged-back), converts the BTC to USD and inserts it into the merchant's account. If the merchant is fraudulent, PayPal can still perform a charge-back on their bank account and that's how consumer protection happens. PayPal already works this way, but they're just exposed to the risk of the consumer performing a charge-back on them, now they eliminate that risk and they can still provide consumer with the ability to perform a charge-back on the seller.


That's somewhat irrelevant, because PayPal will provide the QR code, they will accept the BTC and they'll give the seller USD. All of this works the same way in BitPay right now. PayPal has the proof of payment and the seller doesn't care about how they got their USD as long as they got it.


The seller doesn't care if the buyer is paying with a credit card, bank transfer or Bitcoin, all they care about is that they get their money. Paying for an eBay auction with Bitcoin is completely transparent to the seller and it requires absolutely no change in eBay's/PayPal's charge-back rules. They can always perform the charge-back on the seller. So eBay certainly has an incentive to provide better Bitcoin integration: they don't ever have to deal with charge-backs from the buyers (as long as the buyers are paying with Bitcoin, of course).

1. I highly doubt that Bitcoin will completely replace local currencies, however, it has a very good chance to be the go-to medium of exchange for a significant portion of the Internet transactions. The talk about Bitcoin becoming the currency for countries like Cyprus is just some wishful thinking, IMHO, and I'm a **big proponent** of Bitcoin.
2. A sudden collapse of the banks will indeed be detrimental to society and it may pose risks for Bitcoin. However, the major thing to notice here is that merely having a decentralized currency competing on a large scale against the centralized ones will have a positive impact on the system.
E-mail didn't kill USPS and neither did UPS/Fedex, but they've been gradually phasing USPS out. Would there have been a dramatic negative impact if USPS went belly up 50 years ago? Yes. Would society have any kind of serious negative impact if USPS went belly up today? No. There might be a minor inconvenience to people, the unfortunate USPS employees will lose their jobs, but the overall impact on society will be minimal. 
If people start using Bitcoin en masse, then their risk exposure to centralized banks will be reduced greatly and the centralized banks will slowly start to get phased out of business. As the economy develops around Bitcoin it makes people less reliant on the banks, which minimizes the social impact if (and when) the central banks collapse. The people with more rich imaginations tend to have a more [dramatic and exaggerated idea of how the banks will collapse]( it's [still going to be marvelous]( but not quite as dramatic.

The way I see it, you're taking a calculated risk: you take out a loan for $30K and you risk your credit history on the upshot that you can earn a good profit on that money. The worst thing that can happen is that Bitcoin crashes, you lose the money, you will file for bankruptcy and ruin your credit history (I assume that you don't own anything significant that they can go after). Of course, in about 7 years your credit history will probably recover and you'll be fine.
For me, it was a no-brainer: I took a loan for $25K and invested it in Bitcoin when it was around $12. I've been selling $700 worth of bitcoins a month in order to make the loan payments. Let's look at the moral landscape we live in and who we're competing against: the big banks have been doing this for years and they were not doing anything which actually supports the average person. When you get a loan to buy Bitcoin, you support the entire Bitcoin community and that helps the average person WAAAAY more than the banks ever did!

They're still going to buy/accept Bitcoin for whatever reasons they have, but now they'll have an opportunity to spend them not just hoard them or speculate on the price. PayPal isn't there to give them reasons to buy/accept Bitcoins, it's there to give them reasons to spend them, which is what you want to be able to do with a currency! 
And is consumer protection is not enough of a reason? If people can get consumer protection for their Bitcoin purchases, then it might give them an incentive to start accepting Bitcoin. All of this increases Bitcoin exposure and allows people to decide whether they'd want to use Bitcoin or PayPal depending on their privacy/protection requirements: if they want more privacy, then they go directly with Bitcoin; if they want more consumer protection, then they go with PayPal.


Right, that's 193 countries in which you can pay using PayPal, which allows anybody who has Bitcoin to spend it in any of those countries **even if the merchant doesn't accept Bitcoins due to their volatility risk!** If people have no way to spend it, then why would they care to either buy them or accept them?
Furthermore, there is a difference between the number of countries that PayPal is accepted and the number of countries where consumers can fund their accounts from. [There are numerous countries]( where you can open a PayPal account, but you can't fund it from a bank/source in your country.

Well, I'll give you my 2 cents about the problems I see with the current bitcoin lending solutions.
1. The borrower tends to say how much interest they want to pay, a lender is not obligated to accept the terms but that still doesn't provide realistic interest rates.  
2. There is no reliable ways provided for determining the correct interest rate for a particular borrower.  
If you can figure out the interest rate issue, then you might be on a good path. I am exploring a couple of ideas, but it's a tough problem ;).

I'm sure that HSBC is advertising everywhere, but like I said: there are only a handful of international banks that have that kind of presence. Furthermore, HSBC is not advertising their ATM presence at the airport, they're more likely advertising their international banking services. I'm sure that non HSBC customers can use the HSBC ATM, but with a Bitcoin ATM your customer base is **a lot** bigger so your ROI is going to be considerably larger. This makes the Bitcoin ATM operator a lot more competitive for an ATM spot at the airport.
I think the bigger issue is whether the airport will be willing to allow a startup company with a high risk of failure to place their ATMs there. At the very minimum, it would be a huge hassle for the airport to deal with the whole process of authorizing the small company, giving security clearance to whoever is going to be maintaining it (cash flow, etc) **and** in case the company goes belly up, then cleaning up after them.

You *seriously underestimate* ignorant people's ability to get into high position in their respective fields. The bias of the media is toward sensationalism, not towards accurate reporting.

We've created a system that rewards "popularity" and "low effort sensationalism." The sad part is that it works on both ends: the media is too ignorant to get factual statements and the public knows that they're getting fed stupid reporting, but they're still screaming "propaganda" without even bothering to investigate if it's really truly propaganda or not.

I don't see that happening. There are two ways that the price can be pushed up/down and I see both of them as being good:
1. Making massive bids: that would be good, because it will drive the price of bitcoin up. It could be paramount to a pump and dump, but a pump and dump only works if the commodity they're pumping up is inherently worthless. Bitcoin is inherently useful so they're risking A LOT by trying to pump up something that people will actually want.  
2. Shorting Bitcoin: that could drive the price down, but it will only work if they can borrow the Bitcoins. In that case, they'll have to pay interest at the market rate (there is no Fed to give them low interest Bitcoin loans), so the lender will make money. Assuming that the Bitcoin community is lending (perhaps a shameless plug here might be useful, but I'm coming out with a [beta lending service soon]( or if you PM me I can send you a link to the functional private alpha), then it's a win for the community again, because the price will eventually recover. Naked shorts are the only really troublesome ones, but that would have to be something that the exchange allows and it's **extremely** risky, for both the exchange and the trader.


Then they're doing everybody a favor :).  They'll be running the Bitcoin validation, but that's assuming that they think Bitcoin mining is more profitable than what they're doing now and I'll wager that it's not :)&gt;. Well, I actually know it's not more profitable, because of how Bitcoin works: when more miners come into town, then the Bitcoin mining difficulty increases and their $30k ASIC miners, regardless of how many they have, are not going to be able to pay for themselves. About the only thing they can do is buy up enough hashing power to shut down the network... frankly, I don't even think they can do that, because the demand for mining hardware will become so great that it would be financially inefficient for them to try it. BFL can't even fulfill the orders of their current customers, let alone do something for wall street. It's feasible that if they could short Bitcoin and buy enough hashing power to shutdown Bitcoin, then they could make a lot of money, but again: highly unlikely given that they're making a LOT more than $500 million right now.

Either you're confused about what the Just-World theory is or I am. As far as I understand it, it relates to the cognitive bias that human actions yield just results: i.e. people that do good tend to be rewarded and people that do bad tent to get punished. You quoted me saying that law abiding citizens tend not to get in trouble and that's got nothing to do with a cognitive bias towards justice, it's just the reality of how our justice system works. The justice system has tons of cases which to go after, so they're not very willing to spend a lot of resources on innocent Joe-schmoe. Not that it doesn't happen, but DAs are very unlikely to spend resources and prosecute people like that.

It is true that a lot of the bitcoins are hoarded, perhaps for speculation purposes. I know several people that hold over 3k bitcoins as an investment and they're not miners.
Since we were addressing GPU miners originally, I am a bit doubtful that GPU miners are hoarding a significant number of bitcoins given that the mining is not very profitable at the moment and they have to recover at least some of their investments:

In a bond hearing the prosecution has the right to request more information about the source of the bond and if they can prove that the bond came from illegal activities, then the bond can be denied. Frankly, after the bond has been approved, the bondsmen simply does not care where the money came from: they accept either cash or secured checks (money order, etc) and they don't even care who posts it, regardless of the fact that a particular person was identified as the source during the bond hearing. From what I understand they get the order from court that the inmate can post bond and that's it.

Frankly, I'm OK with running the risk of having government legislation interfere with Bitcoin. I think it's very unlikely to actually happen and the benefit of lower transaction fees, lower transfer fees and support for large investors is totally worth it, IMHO. Furthermore, foreign Bitcoin exchanges, like BitStamp, will still continue to operate so if things go sour in the US, we can still use the foreign exchanges to continue operations.
I would also welcome the influx of cash into the Bitcoin economy, that would just make it grow much faster and it will also bring in a lot more certainty to the market. In addition, it will also help Bitcoin shed a lot of the negative connotations by having large investors in the market.
When it comes to High Frequency Trading, I would wager that it increases efficiency. HFTs tend to increase the transaction volume, but long term investors (generally) still maintain the majority ownership of the securities involved. There is not a whole lot an HFT can do when a long term investor tries to get in or out of the market. Unless you're thinking about day-trading, I wouldn't worry about HFTs.


The main problem is that the "robber barons" actually have legislative control over the monetary policy, lending practices, interest rates and that gives them the ability to devalue the dollar. However, they can't have such control over Bitcoin: the Bitcoin supply is fixed, the lending practices which are emerging are P2P based, the Fed can't control the interest rates of a currency which they can't print, etc. They'll be forced to play by the same rules as everybody else, thus leveling the playing field.

Your first argument is that bitcoin was designed with illegal transactions in mind and that the majority of bitcoin transactions are of illegal nature. I refuted those arguments and you cited Paul Krugman saying that *"as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items."*
I pointed out that Krugman has been wrong before, so his authority does not make him correct. I cited a rebuttal to his arguments and I've pointed out statistics which contradict his claim. After that you shifted the goal post and suggested that I refute ALL of Krugman's arguments, a classic logical fallacy.
You also made a bunch of claims about bitcoin which were completely wrong and I refuted those as well. You have dropped all of your points, you have repeatedly used logical fallacies and you have shown a complete failure in understanding bitcoin.


Now you continue with ad hominem attacks.


Maybe you should read your own posts and try not to use so many logical fallacies. You're boring me now, good bye!

A lot of people are really missing the *big picture* here! If PayPal accepts Bitcoin as a funding instrument, it will open up the flood gates for spending Bitcoin and it will have numerous other benefits:
* **You will be able to spend your bitcoins on eBay!!!**
* **People from all those countries currently not supported by PayPal can now fund their PayPal accounts with Bitcoin!**
* PayPal provides consumer protection!
* Merchants will get Bitcoin payment processing directly from PayPal!
* They may even be a sort of proxy exchange where the average Joe can buy Bitcoins with money from their credit card or bank account.

I'm not sure what you mean when you say that they would "deleverage from the bitcoin market"... do you mean that they would sell the bitcoins they have? 
If that's the case, then there are two assumptions that you're making:
1. GPU mines have earned enough money to cover their costs and earn extra bitcoins which they haven't sold yet.
2. GPU miners will have some kind of group incentive to massively sell their bitcoins despite the rising price of bitcoin.
In the first case: I would think that the number of outstanding bitcoins they have is fairly small, simply because mining is a break-even game most of the time. So even if they decided to sell, there wouldn't be a great impact.
In the second case: it's highly unlikely that all of the GPU miners will suddenly decide to sell their outstanding bitcoins, namely because they've been holding them for so long and it's clear that bitcoin is going up. They stand to gain a lot more if they hold on to their bitcoins rather than selling them.
In short: I don't see a particular reason why the scenario you describe is viable.

**The information is public**, I'm out here saying exactly how I invested in Bitcoin and you're still holding? But I suppose you're not a hypocrite for it :).


I don't think I ever said that the OP shouldn't pay it back... I said that the **worst** thing that could happen is the Bitcoin crashes, OP loses all his money, then files for bankruptcy and ruin his credit history. Of course, in bankruptcy court you will have to prove that you can't pay your loan and the only way that can happen is if you either lost your job or the bank lent you more money than they should have. I don't see either of those as being true and if they are, then somebody made a bad risk calculation. Bad risk calculations are part of capitalism, but expecting a bailout for a bad risk calculation is not. I'm taking a perfectly calculated risk and the bank is too, but if they rig the game so they offload the risk to the public then that's when I call bullshit.


So can the bank when they lend me the money: that's their investment!

I don't often have to do this and I have transferred large amounts of money before. I have no problem with using other exchanges, nor is my foresight insufficient enough to not prepare for a situation like this. As a matter of fact, I had the funds available to transfer to another exchange and complete the transaction there, but MtGox has been giving me the run around for two weeks. Every day they were telling me that the transaction is about to go through.
Is it my fault that I trusted them to tell me the truth? Yes!  
Is it their fault that they lied to me (or "omitted" to inform me) about the actual status of the transaction? Yes!  
I started my transfer on June 5th and they've been telling me that it's about to go through any day now. The money is already on the way through BitStamp and I expect to get it in a couple of days, however, I'm still pissed off that MtGox wasted my time!

There is a way to reduce the risk: 
1. Buy BTC in the US airport and wait for enough confirmations (1 hr).  
2. Go to the **website** of the German ATM and withdraw in EUR.  
3. The German ATM will give you a confirmation code.  
4. When you land in Germany, you go to the first ATM and withdraw with that confirmation code.  
Note: you can even send the BTC directly to the German ATM in step 1, rather than sending it to yourself and then to the German ATM. If you use green addresses, then the whole thing could probably even be done in less than an hour.

HFT's are really good at exploiting market inefficiencies, which is good for the market in general, because it makes the market more efficient. However, HFT's can't operate in an environment like Bitcoin (for the moment), because they rely on extremely fast order execution and high volumes in order to "work their magic." None of the exchanges can support the type of traffic and latency we normally associate with HFT's.
Indeed, market inefficiencies do benefit those who seek to profit for them, but they are called **inefficiencies** for a reason. HFT is a competitive game and this competition is what makes things fair: on the short term HFT's eliminate inefficiencies and in on the long term they provide liquidity for long-term investors to enter/exit their positions without causing dramatic drops in prices (like we've seen with Bitcoins recently). HFT's and long term traders are not in competition with each other, it's more of a symbiotic relationship. The only people affected by HFT's are day traders and pure speculators.

You'd have to lose your job and assets too, because if you go to bankruptcy court they'll first try to garnish your wages then seize your assets.

Your best bet is to keep your job, get a loan, buy bitcoins and sell a few bitcoins a month to cover your loan's payment and bank on the profits. That way you keep your assets, you keep your job and you don't ruin your credit score. While your advice is entertaining, it's also quite dangerous! :)

Which is exactly what I said and that's exactly what you're doing: you started making personal attacks against me! You cite Krugman's background as if it automatically makes all of his arguments right and I have rightfully pointed out that arguing from authority is false, because he has been wrong on several occasions. I'm not using Krugman's history to refute his argument, I'm using Krugman's history to show that his position of authority does not automatically mean that he's right, thus refuting your argument from authority. You were clearly throwing around his Noble Prize in an attempt to make an argument from authority. In my previous comments I also provided you a link with a detailed rebuttal of Krugman's argument.


See the [Bitcoin protocol specifications]( for your reference. You appear to have very little knowledge on what it means for something to be a [computer protocol](


That sentence doesn't even make sense, you're just throwing around terminology without even knowing what it means. The trade of bitcoin has nothing to do with its cryptographic features. The cryptographic features only secure the *transactions* of bitcoin, not the *trade* of bitcoin. The trade of bitcoin occurs in exchanges or over the counter and the cryptographic nature of bitcoin has no impact on the security of its trade. This is evident from the fact that the bitcoin protocol only addresses the transactions of bitcoins, not the trade of bitcons.


Bitcoins transactions occur in accordance to the Bitcoin protocol, so you're confused about two things here: the (bitcoin) transaction unit and the (bitcoin) transaction protocol. 


Wrong again! Please read the bitcoin protocol and stop wasting my time. How on earth could you make distributed network give a particular person a reward in USD, GBP or EUR (aka fiat) over the internet without incurring a transaction cost? How would you possibly make the fiat reward anonymous? And finally, how would you manage the distribution of fiat currency without a central authority?  


My entire point was to rebut your claim that bitcoin was designed specifically to allow illicit activities and that its primary use is for illicit activities. I have provided statistics to demonstrate that both claims are wrong. For a rebuttal of Krugman's other arguments you can take a look at the link I provided earlier.


Again, you fail to understand what an ad hominem attack is. I'm not bringing up Krugman's past failed predictions to prove that he's wrong, I'm bringing them up to demonstrate that his credentials do not guarantee that he's right, so your argument from authority is negated. The rest is just you trying to squirm away from that fact.


I have refuted your initial argument that bitcoin is designed with illicit activities in mind and that it's primary use is for illicit activities. As we've seen, you've pretty much dropped that argument altogether. When it comes to understanding bitcoin, you have completely failed to show knowledge on the topic. You don't know the difference between trades and transactions, you don't know what a protocol is, you clearly have no clue why a fiat reward would not work in a decentralized system and you have shown complete failure to understand what bitcoin is in general. After refuting **all of your arguments** you are now shifting the goal post (yet another logical fallacy) and you are expecting me to refute Krugman's argument as well (for which I have referenced a rebuttal). So let's count the logical fallacies you've used so far:
1. Ad hominem attacks.  
2. Argument from authority.  
3. Non sequitur arguments.  
4. Shifting the goal post.  
You just can't stay away from logical fallacies, can you?

And what's the biggest barriers to people using Bitcoin? There are a couple:  
1. Not enough places to spend it.
2. No big companies are really expressing confidence in it (except Wordpress). 
Two birds with one stone. 


Several reasons for the buyers:
* Consume protection: they want to be protected from fraudulent sellers.
* Lives in a country which isn't supported by PayPal. 
There are a couple more which are less important, but still apply for a buyer that:  
* Is an early Bitcoin investor that wants to spend some Bitcoins now.
* Wants to make a (pseudo) anonymous transaction and is willing to forgo the consumer protection.  
Finally, **depending on how PayPal sets it up**, if they immediately convert the BTC to USD when the account is funded and they allow you to deposit the USD into your bank account, then there are two more possibilities:
* The merchant wants to use PayPal as a volatility protection. 
* People want to sell their Bitcoins without going to an actual exchange. 
In the first case the merchant can get reduce their risk of exposure to Bitcoin volatility even if they directly accept Bitcoins on their website (i.e. without the buyer actually having a PayPal account). The seller would receive Bitcoins, then immediately transfer the Bitcoins into their PayPal account by using the funding option. They get the USD immediately and they don't have to worry about 
In the second case a person can do the same thing that a merchant does, but simply utilize the funding option as a way to sell their bitcoins without going to an actual exchange (i.e. PayPal does all the work for them). I suspect that PayPal will not be allowing this type of thing to occur, but if they do it's an interesting possibility.

If you're paying for groceries or coffee, it's usually quite safe to accept the bitcoin transaction with 0 confirmations. You get the transaction notification pretty much instantly, so the chance of a double-spend with 0 confirmations is [between 9%]( and [50% depending on the type of double-spend attack]( And even at 50% chance of a successful attack, it's still a bit of a gamble despite the fact that their potential for loss is very small. However, the point of sale retailers can require that you place a small transaction fee with your transaction, which further reduces your chances of a double-spend. This way they can accept the 0 confirmation transaction and reduce the risk to about 9% for successful double-spend. Given that the amounts they're accepting are generally relatively small, it's usually OK to do that.

I don't have dependents and the expense is unplanned. I'm actually helping a friend.

That's fine, but they can give me back my money, I can buy BTC and go to another exchange that can wire the money. However, MtGox won't even do that... am I asking for too much?

This is too easy... so why would you quote him and cite his Noble Prize *"Ah I see. You understand this better than a Nobel prize winner?" 
If you didn't think that his arguments were true or that his credentials give more weight to his argument, then why would you even mention it?

Nope, it's not their "primary use case" either. The "primary use case" is to serve as a currency. Any other use cases, even illegal ones, occur organically in the same way that they do on the internet. Bitcoin, TCP, IP, etc. they're all just protocols, and just because people find it easy to use them for illegal purposes, does **not** mean that the protocols were specifically designed with those purposes in mind.

Again: solve the volatility reason and I'm with you. Until the volatility reason is solved, the merchants have a huge barrier to accept bitcoin. If PayPal becomes a player, then it will increase the transaction volume for Bitcoin and exchanges will be built to cater to market makers like PayPal (and other large players that follow suit). That will reduce the volatility, which will increase the incentive for merchants to accept Bitcoin.

If they accept credit cards, then they have the infrastructure for internet connectivity. At the POS they don't need to have a full client, they can get by with a hosted wallet and they can even require that people use green wallets.
The best case scenario is that they can execute a double-spend with a 50% probability of success, but the odds are greatly reduced if the merchant requires that a transaction fee be sent as well. In reality it's closer to 9%.


Yes, the two transactions can be seen in a matter of seconds. A merchant can also opt out to use green addresses only and they will know the name of the customer (in case it is in fact a double-spend). It would be easy to prosecute that person, much like they prosecute thefts.

I wouldn't call them scapegoats, they're just criminals and they're a serious problem... especially the ones that involve violent crime. They were a serious problem when the Internet was coming up too, but they weren't a show stopper. Here is how I see the list:
1. Child pornographers.  
2. Gun smugglers.  
3. Terrorists.  
I wouldn't put drug trafficking in the list, because if drugs are decriminalized then the violence around it will decrease drastically. It's a prohibition issue, not a violent crime issue.

The incompetence of your customer service is beyond belief! If you can't process the wires, then **DON'T HOLD UP MY FUNDS!!!** Put the money back in my account, let me buy my BTC and go to another exchange that **can process the wires.** I have $25K being held up for 2 weeks and there go at least another 2 weeks before I can even think about accessing the money!!! **People's well-being is dependent on the money and there are plenty of other exchanges that can handle the transfers!**
The response from your customer service has been pathetic! 
Statements from MtGox customer service (in order):  
Me: My wire is late.  
MtGox: Please check with your bank.  
Me: The bank said that the sender should initiate a wire trace.  
MtGox: We are really sorry, you should receive the money within 3 days.  
Me: The 3 days have passed and I still have nothing in my account.   
MtGox: The funds are delayed, our top management team is working on resolving the issue.  
Me: is my withdrawal, which was initiated on June 5th, also suspended or is that just withdrawals going forward. (Once the statement came out on June 20 that the US withdrawals are being suspended.)  
MtGox: Yes, your withdrawal is also suspended.  
Me: OK, then can I get the money back in my account? I don't want to hold USD when I don't have to. I'll just buy BTC.   
MtGox: The status of transfer is "processed," we can't put the money back in your account.  
Me: If the status is "processed," then why don't I see the money in my bank account? Apparently the transfer isn't processed and you just told me in the previous message that the transfer is on hold. If you have the money, then you can clearly send it back into my account, just cancel the transfer.  
MtGox: Gives me the generic statement they gave all customers on June 20 and does **nothing** to fix the situation.  
I'm fucking tired of these chumps! I will complete my transaction on BitStamp &amp; CampBX and as soon as they give me my money back I will stop using MtGox **period**! I have to wait over a month on a time critical transfer! **If you can't provide a reliable service, then let me go to someone who can!**

Apparently you don't understand what's an ad hominem attack and you don't understand that bitcoin is a computer protocol. That's **technology**-related quite a bit and citing historic incorrectness is a valid rebuttal: Kruger has historically made wrong claims of epic proportions about the economic future of technology. If you're asked to evaluate the advice of somebody, then you'd have to look at how sound their advice has been in the past to determine how much you should trust their advice for the future. The more consistently accurate they've been, more you would trust them and vice versa. So Krugman has shown to be quite inconsistent, therefore I will put very little (if any) trust in his opinion, but a broken clock is right twice a day so feel free to accept them.  It would be an ad hominem attack if I called Kruger a name or I attacked him personally, which I didn't. And don't forget that I also cited a rebuttal to Krugman's arguments, so by all accounts your claims are just plain false.


Since you've dropped nearly all of your arguments, it appears that your claim that I'm wrong is simply false. Furthermore, even if I did have a mental handicap or I lacked cognitive capacity of some sort it wouldn't be relevant to the arguments I'm making: the arguments I'm making stand on their own merits and you'd have do demonstrate that they're wrong. That's an attack on a personal level, rather than on my actual arguments, so it's an ad hominem attack. You can either demonstrate a logical fallacy within my arguments or you can't and so far you haven't been able to, so you've resorted to slinging mud and hoping that it sticks. **Just face it: you have failed to produce a sound argument, now be gone!**

They're already charging fees, so is BitPay, but merchants still prefer to use them in order to mitigate the risk of fluctuating bitcoin prices. Fees are not the killer of Bitcoin and just take a moment to understand how it opens up the Bitcoin market! You would sentimentally be able to fund your account with Bitcoin and purchase anything you want anywhere PayPal is accepted, which is just about everywhere! Furthermore, PayPal can prompt eBay to make it MUCH easier to integrate Bitcoin payments directly into eBay auctions!

There is a pretty [thorough rebuttal]( of Krugman's arguments.
Furthermore, pointing out his historically bad predictions in the technology sector is quite relevant when you attempt to cite him on another technology related topic. What's particularly concerning there is the magnitude of his failure: he predicted that the Internet will have no bigger impact than the fax machine, which is a blunder of cosmic proportions. The Internet has turned out the be one of the most important technological advancements in humanity and it has resulted in one of the biggest economic forces in the world. You cite him as if he's an infallible authority on the topic and history has shown quite the contrary!

How many bitcoins could they possibly buy up? Even if they do buy up a bunch, then losing them will have little effect on the market since bitcoins are nearly infinitely divisible.

You're missing the point: if eBay has interest in allowing PayPal to accept Bitcoin, then they would have an interest in integrating Bitcoin payments directly. Suppose that a merchant is using PayPal as a payment processor and PayPal accepts Bitcoins, now eBay can put a QR code directly on the auction and the payment gets processed by PayPal. This benefits the merchant because they don't have any BTC volatility risk AND it makes eBay/PayPal's "lives" a lot easier.

How about you just buy $800 worth of bitcoins? That would be about 47 BTC. The gains have been pretty solid so far, I bought in at $6.50 and $12-ish. I don't mine and I'm pretty happy with the returns on my investment so far.
Note that since mining tends to be a break-even venture (at best), you are probably going to buy more bitcoins with the $800 than if you actually tried to mine. In other words: more bitcoin for your buck if you just buy them!
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:09:13
Apparently you don't have $25K being held up by MtGox for what looks like it will be a month! I need them for a time critical issue and people's well-being is dependent on the transfer!!! They can't handle the business and they won't let me buy BTC with **my money** (which they're holding) so I can take my money to someone who can handle the business and service their customers in a timely fashion. I've already started making the transfers with BitStamp and CampBX, but as soon as I get all of my money back from MtGox, I'm going to stop using MtGox **period!** I've made over $1 million worth of transactions (buy/sell/wire), I'm sure they'll be happy to lose my business!

Every person trading bitcoins knows that there are risks involved with buying bitcoin and people were expecting a correction in the prices sooner or later. However, the failure of MtGox to maintain operations has resulted in enormous loss of confidence in bitcoin and many people holding bitcoins have suffered very big losses. In your defense, the same thing happened when Facebook had their IPO, [NASDAQ crashed and it caused more than $1 trillion in equity was "temporarily" wiped out in minutes](

That's actually bad for the average person that wants to spend their Bitcoins. Have you tried convincing the store-owner down the street to accept Bitcoin? It's quite hard, because they don't know anything about Bitcoin **and** they're not willing to get exposed to **volatility risk**. About the only way they're going to be willing to accept a Bitcoin payment is if they are not exposed to volatility risk, which is why BitPay has seen such a rapid rise in popularity.

Sure you can send BTC directly, but if the merchant does not accept BTC (and 99.99% of them don't), then you're stuck! PayPal can do the same thing that BitPay does, but on a MUCH LARGER scale! Their customer base is enormous, so if you think that BitPay is good for Bitcoin, then I don't see why you're against PayPal doing the same thing that BitPay does.

You're still missing the part that they're converting BTC into USD **at the market price**. If you're familiar with supply and demand economics: the lower the supply, the higher the demand which means the higher the price. So every Bitcoin they hold decreases the supply and increases the demand, so now every BTC they try to convert into USD will cost them more and more money! That would mean that people would use smaller and smaller fractions of BTC, so it will become exponentially harder for PayPal to get more BTC. If all of that money is coming out of PayPal's own pockets, then they're operating at a loss and I doubt any corporation would like to operate at a loss.

In this case it is... bitcoin is just another computer protocol. If you have a better idea I'd love to hear it, but so far you haven't actually offered a better idea. Correction, you haven't offered **any idea at all**.


And I defer you back to Krugman's prophetic comments from 1998:




Wait, doesn't he have a neck beard? [Ah, yes he does!]( So let's see your awesome arguments so far:
* Ad hominem attacks: check!

That was how I described it, because I'm using it as an investment account: I put money in, I buy Bitcoins and I declare capital gains.

That's partial regulation of Bitcoin, it's mostly miners and exchanges that are affected. Bitcoin transactions are still unregulated, so that's what I was considering non-regulated when we I was asked. And after being on the stand for about 30 minutes you just kinda wanna get this done and move on- it seems like quite a long time when you're up there, so I just gave him the short answer which wasn't that far from reality.

For some reason I have the feeling that too much misfortune simply doesn't befall a law-abiding citizen, usually you have to do some pretty serious stuff before s**t hits the fan. Most of the time criminals have a really canny ability to shift the blame, to victimize themselves and to manipulate people for their own gain. I hope that this provides some insight into my skepticism.
**Now, I'll grant you that in the history of mankind there have been plenty of genuinely unfortunate people, so let's just assume you're really one of them...** and even if you weren't: if you want to keep Big Brother out of your pocket book, then stick to [buying bitcoin locally]( with cash, look for cash-based work opportunities and if you have some technical skills then offer them up for bitcoins. The bitcoin economy is developing at a steady rate, so there will be **plenty** of business opportunities around it as well.

He may have some extreme political ideas, but he's spot on with his defense and explanation of bitcoin. I watched some of his other interviews where he does indeed talk about the demise of the world as we know it, but I can't say that I agree with him. He uses some solid reasoning to point out why our monetary system is in shambles; however, he does make a fairly big leap to the conclusion that it will end up in some kind of dystopian state with the US being ground zero. If that's really the case then it undermines not only bitcoin, but all of the precious metals as well. If the world economy is in ruins, then people are hardly going to be worried about how much gold they have- they'd be more worried about how many bullets do they have and how to feed/protect their families.
With regards to the Bitcoin ATM project: he did his part, they weren't seeing eye to eye and he got booted off. Maybe there was a good reason, maybe there wasn't, but I don't care much about that.

I don't edit the wiki and I don't think it's censorship to have an open debate about what's an intellectually honest claim and what's not.
Your entire objection against Litecoin is due to some inherent disadvantages it has compared to Bitcoin. An objective statement about Litecoin would be to point out those flaws, but the step you go into which is **not** objective is to claim that they're a Ponzi Scheme, Pyramid Scheme or Pump and Dump Scheme. We've already established that it's neither a Ponzi nor a Pyramid scheme and I've demonstrated that pump and dump can be done on any security.
I understand that your technical evaluation is that Bitcoin is superior to Litecoin, but you then make specific predictions about the longevity of Litecoin and that seems pretty subjective. That's the only problem I have there... nothing more, so I don't see how pointing that out is akin to censorship.

The statistics don't corroborate your claims and I've already given you the example of e-mail where 58% of e-mails are spam, that does **not** mean that that e-mail was designed with spam in mind and it would be pretty stupid to argue that reading e-mails directly enables spammers to spam you, therefore you should stop reading e-mails period.  
Again, your arguments simply don't hold up to scrutiny.

If you truly think that Bitcoin is a currency, then I see no problem in PayPal using it as another funding source. When large companies like PayPal start accepting Bitcoin it does several things for Bitcoin:
1. It makes it more widely adopted.  
2. It increases it legitimacy.  
3. It makes it an integral and indispensable part of the financial system.  
4. It provides more options for people willing to transact.  
Finally, we want PayPal to use Bitcoin as a funding instrument for the same reason we want BitPay to use Bitcoin as a funding instrument: **it eliminates the volatility risk for merchants.** If you're a merchant, you want to have stability when you're transacting so PayPal and BitPay take care of that risk.

Destroying their bitcoins will not crash the market, no more than sending 1/2 of the world's gold supply to the sun and burning it up. The only way they could negatively affect the price of BTC is that they buy a substantial portion of BTC, the process of which requires them to expend **a lot** of money... that will cause the price of BTC to skyrocket. The next step is for them to do a massive sell-off, and arguably the price will fall to about the same price that they started buying at (which will have a net effect of 0). Of course, their loss in the process will be enormous, so it's kind of a pointless exercise. Furthermore, the bigger the market gets, the harder it gets to even try and make such market swings.

People give them BTC and PayPal has to shell out USD to whoever BTC is being given to. They have to get the USD from somewhere and that can only happen if they sell the BTC. If they hoard the BTC, then they'll have to reach into their own pockets and shell out the USD. That's equivalent to buying up BTC at market value and the less BTC are available in the market, the higher the price per BTC the more USD PayPal will have to shell out for each new BTC that people try to spend. In other words, they can't realistically afford to hoard that many BTC without driving up the price of Bitcon.

Yah, they're not allowing me to. First I asked them if the wire transfer is being held like all the other ones and they said yes. Then I asked if I can cancel the transfer and they said no, because my transfer status is already "processed." Totally outrageous! When I pointed out that they're telling me two different things, they just gave me a link to the general statement from June 20 and that's it! They have my money and they won't let me cancel the wire transfer. Instead, they'll make me wait another 2 weeks and maybe then they'll try to wire the money. After that I have wire the money to an exchange again, just to get that floating money back into BTC. Ridiculous!

DDoS attack stands for **D**istributed **D**enial **o**f **S**ervice attack. The attacker either has control of a large number of computers (referred to as a botnet) or has paid somebody with access to a lot of computers: the computers are ordered to make simultaneous requests to the victim website. In effect, this results in substantially higher than normal traffic to the website to the point that they're no longer able to handle the incoming requests and their ability to service regular users diminishes so much that they're either servicing requests extremely slowly (lag) or practically out of service (completely shut down).
When somebody executes a DDoS attack on MtGox, it prevents people from accessing their accounts, that causes uncertainty, concern, a sell of and a dramatic fall in prices. Since the attacker knows when the DDoS attack will start, all they have to do is sell before it starts then buy when the attack is over. BOOM, they just made a bunch of money, because people eventually calm down and the price recovers.

You're discussing a totally different case. Of course, if the last price was $14.95 and the high is $15.00, then it obviously doesn't make sense for the last price to be the highest.  
However, the situation is different given what was observed here: the last price is $14.27 and the high is $14.00, so there is a glitch of some sort. The high price is, by definition, the highest for the specified period, which should be 14.27 since the last price is included in the period.

How can they prevent a bubble? It's not their job to provide a fair valuation of Bitcoin, however, it is their job to keep the exchange up and running so others can. There is no artificial limit that should be placed, because even if they did shut down the exchange after a 20% drop (which would be extremely unwise, to put it lightly), the price would continue to fall as soon as they open up. The whole point of an exchange is to facilitate trades and they are failing at doing that.

No more than we see in the USD economy, so my point is that Bitcoin makes it no more designed for illegal activities than the USD. Take another example: [e-mail is more than 58% spam]( so does that mean that e-mail was specifically designed to spam people? No, it just means that spammers find it useful for that purpose. You can actually say that spam is the primary use case for e-mail, since more than 50% of all e-mails are spam. Does that mean that e-mail is worthless, bad, or inherently designed to enable spamming? No!


First and foremost, people speculating on the market value of bitcoin does **not** add stability, if anything it adds more instability and uncertainty. Furthermore, refusing to read e-mails removes the ability of spammers to reach out people for illicit activities, should we stop reading e-mails?


You either have freedom or you don't. E-mail gives people freedom to communicate via the internet and it also gives spammers the freedom to attempt to scam people. Would you therefore say that e-mail is not a good alternative to regular regular mail? No, you wouldn't.

It seems like it's just a nice property to have as money, you would want your currency to last a long time. Bitcoin can certainly last a long time, or at least as long as the Internet lasts. Does that give Bitcoin an intrinsic value too?

In this case you're speculating that the price of Bitcoin will go up, but you also want to spend your Bitcoins. So you made a profit AND you're able to spend your profits **anywhere that PayPal is accepted** (and there are a TON of places where it is accepted).
Furthermore, if you live in a country which PayPal doesn't currently support funding from, then this may be about your only option to fund your PayPal account.


If you're in a country that already supports Bank account (Fiat) --&gt; PayPal account, then there may not necessarily be a benefit. However, for every one of those countries that are not, there will be a benefit.
Furthermore, if you're an early investor in Bitcoins, you'd LOVE to spend some of your Bitcoins, but there are just not that many places where you can spend them. The markets accessible by PayPal are just *leaps and bounds* beyond anything you can access now with BTC alone or with BitPay!

So, after all, it appears that some shits are given about bitcoin!


And whoever values those traits can still utilize them, but that "if need be" part is where BitPay and PayPal come in. It appears that there is a need for them to mitigate the volatility risk for merchants.


**People can already use PayPal instead of Bitcoin**, but that doesn't stop them from wanting to use Bitcoin. When merchants accept Bitcoin it just gives the people that want to use Bitcoin more places to use them. Without BitPay (and hopefully now PayPal) those merchants would have never started to accept Bitcoin and there would be even less people willing to buy them because there is no place to spend them. Do you think that WordPress would have started accepting Bitcoin if it couldn't mitigate the volatility risk? Do you think that people care that BitPay is managing that risk for WordPress? No, all they care about is the fact that they can spend their Bitcoins.


Another reason Bitcoin is there in the first place is so that it gives power to the free market for **any** business that wishes to provide **any** service around Bitcoin. If people don't find PayPal's service to be useful, then they wouldn't use it and if they find it to be useful then they would use it. I say let business ideas do or die on their own merits. So stop worrying about which business is providing which service and let the free market do its thing.
P.S. I just noticed that you're being down-voted and I just want to let you know that it's not me.

"For a bout a year i was living it up..."
-- Yah, what you did was not a very well calculated risk :), it's a COMPLETELY different situation. It's difficult not to be judgmental or even offensive when commenting about the risk you took. I'll refrain tho, you seemed to have learned your lesson :).
I'm not saying that everybody should take out credit and risk whatever they want, but given that he's investing the money in a security which seems to be increasing in value at a higher rate than the maximum interest rate of his credit card, then I'd say it's a risk worth taking.

Except they're not :), you were claiming that USD black market economy is only 0.2% of USD transactions and by all other estimates it's closer to 22%.


And by not buying bitcoin you're enabling the bankers to swindle trillions of dollars from hundreds of millions of people. The horrible economic conditions resulting from the actions of these criminals is driving people to crimes related to drugs, which should be decriminalized in the first place. People like you are feeding the black market a lot more than people who buy bitcoins. It's absolutely vile and disgusting that your type of mentality is even remotely accepted in society: instead of attempting to fix the problem, you spit at the only free market solution which empowers people instead of bankers.


You need to update **a lot more** than just your numbers!

Actually it would! PayPal is a payment processor, if I understand it: they accept BTC and give the merchant USD. That allows them to do a charge-back on the merchant if the consumer complains **and** it protects PayPal from consumer charge-backs.
Furthermore it gives the buyer the ability to spend their BTC everywhere that PayPal is accepted and there are *a ton* of places that accept PayPal.

Which is how the money was stolen. He saw a transaction which he didn't make (i.e. bitcoins were **sent**), but that's not possible without the password. Maybe the OP had a crazy night with a lot of scantly clad ladies and a lot of recreational medications, he decided to make a baller move and gambled it all on satoshi dice only to wake up in the morning with no recollection of the events from that night! 
Who knows, but whatever the case is, it doesn't seem plausible that somebody would steal his/her bitcoins without the password for the wallet. *Something else must be going on here.*

But if Bitcoin doesn't crash, then you would have no problems with taking the gains you made due to the douche bag behavior of people like me? I suppose that's not hypocritical...
Furthermore, you have no problem with the fact that if Bitcoin does in fact become big, then it may cause the crash of the dollar and it could potentially cause another bailout of the banks which we all have to pay for? Somebody will lose money, everybody takes a calculated risk and they eat it if they get it wrong, aka capitalism.
I didn't get the good credit that I have by not repaying my loans or making bad decisions, so the risk that the bank has taken when lending me the money was properly evaluated by them. They would not approve me for such a loan if my income wasn't high enough to cover the loan (and it is). The only reason I would have to file for bankruptcy is if I can't actually repay my loan (i.e. lost my job), but they can always garnish my wages as long as I have a job if I refuse to pay. As a matter of fact, I'm making my monthly payments and the bank is receiving interest. I think you may be over-reacting to the risks involved here: I'm pretty confident that every party has accounted for the risk they've taken and they're getting compensated properly.

That's up to the brokers, they have to manage their customers and they have to know how to operate efficiently. If a broker goes down, the exchange doesn't go down and everybody else can still trade. Furthermore, it opens up opportunities for brokerage services (think of eTrade, ShareBuilder, etc).
Think of it as separation of concerns: the **one thing** that we're going to try and provide is a **stable, secure, high performance exchange capable of sustaining the Bitcoin economy.**
Since it's limited seats, we only have to deal with a small set of individuals who are professional, they know how to operate in this kind of environment and they understand how to provide their customers with brokerage services. All of the major exchanges work in this manner and they're doing great, I don't see why it should be different with Bitcoin.

Sorry, I didn't mean to be too critical, I've just been tired of the scammy stuff associated with Bitcoin. There is a reason to give out free Bitcoins and that reason is so people can play around with them. Make it clear for everybody. Have a big title in the middle and 3 bullet points so people can understand what they're looking at within 7 seconds of landing on your page. Again, I like your idea and I'm just suggesting those things so people don't run away (like I did) after going there and not knowing exactly what they're looking at.

Their strategy maybe "if you can't beat them, join them." Pretty smart if you ask me!
Is it a bad thing? Certainly not: any acceptance by major company like that is going to send Bitcoin into the stratosphere! What they're saying is that they don't see Bitcoin as competition, rather it's a complimentary funding instrument. It could be an awesome symbiotic relationship because of the consumer protection that they provide, which is something completely lacking in Bitcoin right now. Some people want the consumer protection, so having an establish payment processor provide them with that protection is absolutely **awesome** (for a lack of better terminology)!

Here is your story:
* The wallet was encrypted.  
* You didn't type the password after the moment you suspect the hack occurred.  
* The transaction occurred.
* You have a strong password.    
Then I don't see how it's possible for you to get hacked. Something happened here without your knowledge and it can be any one of these:
1. You weren't hacked at the time that you thought you got hacked.  
2. Your password is not as strong as you think.  
3. You typed the password after you got hacked (maybe with combination of  .  
Otherwise your story doesn't really make sense, I don't see how you can definitively know exactly when you got hacked.

Read the next response... his ex g/f got caught with a big bag of coke, he supposedly saved her from sex slavery, he might have been in porn and proclaims himself to be "a normally law-abiding citizen who happens to be extraordinarily capable of organising illegal shit."

The transaction has a timestamp on when it happened, so he/she can easily check that and confirm if the money was in fact sent when he/she claims it was sent.

[You're not even close to an early adopter, you would be an innovator]( Innovators are those who adopt the technology up until it has about about 10% market share. The people who join after about 10% market share are considered early adopters, so we're not even close of getting out of the innovators stage, let alone the early adoption stage!
Edit: fixed the market share %.

And you keep making stuff up.


By purchasing and using bitcoins I increase the ratio of legal to illegal transactions. Every moment you hold a USD, you're partaking in the biggest fraud in the history of mankind: the bankers are pillaging the people and causing far more damage than what illegal transactions could ever do, and you are a perfectly willing participant in that system. Now you have an option not to participate, but you're still not taking it and I can't even think of a proper epithet to describe your actions, sad comes to mind...


Currently the USD volume of bitcoin transactions per day is [$21 million]( That's $630 million per month, so SilkRoad barely accounts for 0.2% of the Bitcoin transactions. Freakonomics estimates that [the underground economy is closer to 22%]( and [model-based research seconds these statistics](

Sure we can decide what's fair: the free market tells you what's fair all the time. 
* Today it's fair to pay around $145 per BTC and back in 2012 it was fair to pay around $12 BTC, the price of bitcoin is determined by the free market. Seems fair.     
* The system has a very predictable bitcoin generation rate, so that's fair.  
* Every person that's willing to mine and has to know-how to do it can mine, so that's fair.  
* Every person that doesn't have to know-how can get it by reading books, educating themselves or going to school, so that's fair.  
There group of people is no more arbitrary than any other group of people who see value in something, back it up, invest in it, risk their own money and profit. That's pretty fair ;).
What do you think is unfair?

Well, the airports usually have international terminals. Let's say you're in Chicago O'Hare Airport and you're flying to London Heathrow Airport. Suppose those are the only two airports you're servicing right now: there are 5 terminals in O'Hare, but international flights are always from terminal 5 so you've just narrowed down where you'll place your ATM. There is no reason for you to try and cover the other terminals since all of them are for domestic flights.
Exactly where would you put the ATM in terminal 5? Well, there are 2 security check-points at Departures and 2 exits at Arrivals, so if you want to cover all of them you can go all out and install 4 ATMs: 1 by each security check-point and 1 by each exit. In reality you can cover both Arrives and Departures with only 2 ATMs: 1 between the check-points in Departures and 1 between the exits on Arrivals (both are easily visible). With 2 ATMs alone you can cover **all** international flights from/to Chicago.
Heathrow is a bit more complicated: there are 5 terminals and the international flights are not restricted to a particular terminal. I don't know the exact layout there, but I know they generally have two security check-points on each terminal for Departures (some might have less or more) and let's assume 2 exits for Arrivals per terminal. At worst you'll need 20 ATMs (4 per terminal), but I think it can also be done with 10 ATMs. So with a total of 12 well placed ATMs you cover all international in and out of Chicago and in and out of London. That's not bad :).
Furthermore, only a handful of banks have the international presence to warrant them to put ATMs at airports, so the competition from bank ATMs is not all that high.
