Where’s 123abctard’s FUD comments predicting 1k?
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:21:24
Why buy low when you can wait and FOMO at a much higher price, right?
Once we break 10k is when FOMO will really kick into high gear.

When you’re day trading with small amounts, it may work. When dealing with larger amounts it’s better to hold long term. I’m sure you’re also trading with your coin and not on leverage. Correct me if I’m wrong.

All the negative prophecy is making so bullish right now. I’m almost turned on.

Chances of u/rims_real_big buying or shorting BTC is slim to non. Just types bearish shit for whatever reason.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:22:04
Because it’s not about GS

“Cashed out”
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:39:32
\*lookin' at you sexy fudsters/bears/bcash lovers - we missed you ;) 
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:08:11
So you have a life besides bashing hodlers? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:29:47
i mean as sure as you sound you must have shorted - right? Rollin’ in profits I’m sure 
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:08:11
As if it isn’t already
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:09:41
Right there with you

Tell me more

Knowing as much as you do you’d be stupid to not short. I know you didn’t though. I like your username.

How’s your vertcoin bag holding up?

You can only make money if you actually had it to invest or short.
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:10:05
The haters only waste their time coming in here because they either lost money, don’t have any money or were aware of bitcoin for many years and never paid attention.
Continue to buy at your discretion.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:37:53
You’re only doing it right if you would have sold at $5,900

I can smell the FUD off you
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:08:38
Should have been limit.
Also, post only
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:35:18
That's where it's headed

"two months"
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:40:33
I’m a hodler. I’ve been buying the last two years. I’m very quiet in the subs but today I woke up asking myself the following question - where are the bears now? Hibernating? Please, continue to talk shit. I’ve held through the last six months and will continue to do so till I can buy my toilet paper on Amazon with bitcoin.
Buy some coin and STFU.

Shit posters have been silent lately but slowly gaining strength as the market corrects.
Come out, don’t be shy. Muah.
