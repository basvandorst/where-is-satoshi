Run a node. It contributes to BTC's security and helps keep it "healthy" (but requires full download of blockchain)

It feels like everyone knows by now, but in reality I won't be surprised if over 80% of the world is still in the dark. Even with mainstream news coverage, I believe the majority of people don't know the word "Bitcoin" even exists.

I don't think the community does, McAfee's just part of the package

not scared about the dip, scared that I became so immune to it that I find myself being a risk-junkie

The first quote sounds smart, like it's coming from a wise person, until you hear his stance on Bitcoin... or is he FUDing on purpose?

No, I'm saying the man can't be right 100% of the time. I believe he is exceptionally smart with investments, not downplaying his abilities. But you clearly miscalculated how much info you'd have to read to get a "thorough understanding" of Bitcoin, it certainly shows that you yourself don't know much since you so ignorantly state that, to paraphrase it, "it has failed miserably with catastrophic yearly crashes, it's useless as a store of value". I see your point, but I also highly doubt you're a visionnaire since you don't even see its immense potential. On the other hand, some banks and some companies definitely see crypto as a possible threat. Not bitcoin, but crypto as a whole. I don't think Bitcoin has spooked anyone enough 'today', but it will 'tomorrow'.
P.S.: Stop riding Buffett's dick, I was merely stating an opinion: the specific quote from above can't be taken seriously, not the man... I've read the same investment books he did, Benjamin Graham included, which doesn't mean I can't question his rationale once in a hundred years.

Do you believe that? Warren is certainly smart, but not about everything. You could argue that he knows the world of investing very well and his gut tells "this is a fad", but he also said that he doesn't even know how Bitcoin works. I'm exploring a different idea: it helps him if Bitcoin is considered "a dangerous fad, a mirage", it's in his interest to diminish its power, maybe it even puts the old system that helps him retain power at risk. At this point, I don't think the quote can be taken seriously.

You're clearly having trouble investing and understanding the concept of crypto in the first place. Sell it and you won't have any problems anymore. This just isn't for everyone.

I'm pretty sure the game has been on for quite a while. I'm stretching a little, but joining the game at this time almost feels like being late to a Monopoly game... still worth doing it, but I guess what the man meant is - there's a long way to go, crypto is still in its infancy.

I'd hold my horses on those topics... Oh wait we can't even afford horses yet.
