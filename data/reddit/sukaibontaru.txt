Remember there is no Bitcoin in that sentence.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin because it isn’t traditional and is fully trustless. If it resembles a banking system, there is XRP. You can do better than this.
I am missing something because I really don’t understand the vast acceptance of LN. It’s a glorified checking account. Just a complex shitcoin by then.

It’s a checking account basically. Where KYC, AML etc can be applied for starters. And why people are not questioning this more eludes me.

Why do I feel  like Lightning Network won’t need Bitcoin anymore if it’s successful and everyone is using it.

because it’s a ‘market maker’, not an exchange (probably)

So LBTC is not a shitcoin I suppose? What do you think?
Missed the boat on bitcoin. Should I convert some of my alts to it?

I most probably don’t have an idea other than some grocer-producer analogy.
And the fact that I bought my first (portion of) bitcoin through CoinJar (a market maker, before they became an actual exchange) then discovered Binance.
So I gather I need to have a degree in economics/finance to be in this sub eh?

Well enlighten us then.

You clearly don’t dip. Not buy a dip. Buy ‘the’ dip.
And that is gherkin.
