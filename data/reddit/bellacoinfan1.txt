I got coins they are so much faster than putting money in the bank then transfering it to paypal, pay lots of fees wait like 2 weeks to get my money and spend it. its atrocious, crypto is way faster and cleaner

I think now is the time to buy Dogecoin. I have Dogecoin swipe game and doge clicker on my phone. Kids like it. Great brand recognition. sent the Jamaicans bobsledding lols. Nothing wrong with doge coin just have to buy at the bottom and you probably should have shorted when Bitcoin started goin up from 400 to 600 because all alts suffered. at least you didn't have max or ltc right. personally I have just a small amount of doge. zero ltc. Lots of Bitcoin Because Bitcoin is King. Also I like NXT and Ripple. All Alts are reallly Dicey; Granted. With that Said Doge doesn't compete based off of "new features" that go out of style quickly. it is about having fun. It has a Top Feel good Meme. It makes me feel good when I see it. it has some inflation making it spendable. Kids like it and Kids are the future.  I think I will buy more. not much Just a little. Didn't somebody say that when you feel like crap is the time to buy and when you really Love something is the time to sell. It can be true. why not. Remember when the top post on r/bitcoin was a suicide hotline and Dogecoin Was the safe haven for everyone. I remember. Dogecoin never forget

Also The Governments Know what cryptographic E money is. it has been in development since the 80's and it clearly has significant benefits. Thats why we are all here after all. I personally believe that the Governments are in on it to begin with. The police want it to happen, It would make there jobs alot easier with permanent records and alibi's all over the place. its borderless and a truly world wide currency. World policy is easier with World money. Yes i'm into conspiracies but Whatever. I mean Do we really believe that "the gumment didn't see internet money coming from a mile away. Al gore himself Invented the internet, Check out the Dollar collapse video's, (just for fun and entertainment folks, Don't freak out. I think the government's being so well thought out Want this to happen. I mean who do you think owns the 1 million Bitcoins, Some anonomous asshole. I don't thnink so. (we are much more likely to grasp something that we thought was invented by a caring individual but really it was the government and they can use that 1 million bitcoins to "Regulate the market all they want")

People Like bitcoin for good reason. If they loose money it is because they bought it at a relatively high price which isn't Bitcoins Fault. People recognize this. Even if every country makes bitcoin illegal, Can you really blame Bitcoin. No It just Do what it Dud
