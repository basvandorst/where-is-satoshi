Well say for example you took a loan of 15.000usd and bought 1.0 bitcoin.
How much would it have to go up in order for you to gain a profit? 
That means you need to gain enough to cancel out the interest on the loan, so that's 12% and also think of the taxes when taking an profit.
To make any sort of money you'd need it to go up atleast 50%
Then it'll be over 20k.
Amazing right? Could happen within a month. But what if it starts dropping on the 18th december when futures kick in. 
What if it drops 60-80% of current value, would you survive? What if it stays low for 2 years before starting an insane bull run again, would you survive?
Would you sell if it drops too much and stays low?
Would you sell the moment it hits 20k? Or would you keep holding in hopes of it going higher?
What if it goes to 30k
Then crashes for a few months down to 6k?
All in all, if you think you can comfortably pay it off in due time and you're still young and doesn't have a family to provise for i'd say go for it.
Cliche i know but you only live once and an agressive risk might very well be worth it in the long run.
Just do know, it is a BIG risk.

You're all probably right. 
It just sucks to have to watch it all from the sidelines not being able to get in on the rise. I believe it has the potential to reach 10.000 by febuary. 
But like my father always said, don't spend money you don't have. 
Thanks for your replies. I guess i'll just have to wait and start investing when i actually have the money.

It's not that i want to get rich quick.
I can invest like 500eu per month and still save enough to take vacations and what not.
I'm seeing my future in 2035 - 2055 and being able to retire from hodling. I never intend to sell in many many years because i actually believe in this system.
And even though that's how i feel i still feel the need to buy more and more. It sorta feels like i'll never have time to get enough before it rockets.
And yeah, i should just chill and take it easy, i'm still way ahead of other people who don't like bitcoins or people who hasn't even heard of it, that doesn't make it any easier though.
And it's easy to say "Just don't look at the prices" or whatever, "Just don't think about it"
 But that's a lot harder to actually do than say for some reason, shits messed up, don't even know where this 'addiction' came from, never really been addicted to anything but this, this i can't stop thinking about.
Not gonna take any more loans just gonna wait out salary after salary. Was just interested in hearing other peoples view on this since well, i never experienced such a 'need' before.
Thanks for all the replies! I guess i'll just try to calm down or something.

Here's some more info. I know it's risky but hey, even if it goes to shit i can probably deal with it, and if it doesn't then well, yay?
I earn around 3000 usd after taxes each month
I can safely save 1000 usd and still live comfortably, not cheaping out on stuff.
I have a stable job
I live in sweden
If i were to lose my job i'd get 80% of my salary for 6 months or until i find another job.
So even if it goes to shit i should still be fine.
Does this change anyones opinion on wheter or not i should take out a loan?
