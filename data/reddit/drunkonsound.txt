We are considering doing but I want to make it clear it is not meaningless to share the addresses.
Users can still verify their funds are under our control with the current system. We have been drafting up something similar to your suggestion where we show our users accounts masked, but there are still flaws even with that system. You have to assume all the masked accounts are real and show correct balances since there is no third party verification. We are working on a solution that tries to solve the described issue too.

You analogy is flawed. In this system decentralization is important and specialization provides no benefits, if anything it hurts decentralization.

Game theory doesn't ever attempt to account for unknown factors. It applies to a lot of things badly. And if you get all your knowledge about it from wikipedia, maybe you should take some time to educate yourself before getting into debates about it.

The peg is maintained by the NuCommunity using a decentralized autonomous corporations. It is hard to summarize your answer without having knowledge about the project, it

This is a very good suggestion, I like the idea of using the most recent block hash to verify current ownership. We will be working to add this update to our reserves system and should have it released soon.

You can read more about our choices of coins and what we consider innovative here:  
We are using the profits for this to develop a geo-local cryptocurrency wallet that will work with any Bitcoin based coin. Read more about it here:

Andreas is your typical short sighted self interested mainstream libertarian,  hes bad for the community.

Sounds like a move to guarantee plutocrats position in this new economy
@_date: 2014-06-15 10:54:00
Again proof game theory is flawedcand self regulating doesnt work. We need an engineering solution and not rely on people to check their own greed.

You mean the theory that even John Nash now says is stupid and sociopathic. No, I would rather it be developed using better methods of modeling human interaction.

You are ignoring that an Exchange could add in additional accounts that don't belong to users to inflate the user balance. 
I believe the best solution must involve verifiable cryptographic proof and not rely on the the exchange providing reliable data. We really like the nonce solution proposed here:  
We have begun drafting a solution like the above implementation, we are dedicated to continue to improving transparency and our proof of reserve system.

Because we can plan to add NuBits. Nubits is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the USD in a decentralized way. It lets us essentially have USD markets while letting users collect their USD and store them on their own computer.

Or niether of those options. ASIC minerscare specialized and expensive,  the original design was to have a network ran by each user not specialized mining farms ran by a small group of rich people.
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:37:09
Bitcoin was made to tell rich people who have power and prefer it to be centralised to fuck off, so I don't see how this is a down side.

The plutocrats wont let this happen unless they can secure a large stake

This is exactly why game theory and libertarianism is short sighted. We need to eng ineer a better system not rely on people to not be greedy.

In this reply a condescending asshole pretends he knows a lot instead of making a useful post explaining the answer to a question.
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:57:26
Perhaps you should make a post with a list then?
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:54:08
Well he did pretend to apply game theory, which is notoriously bad at modelling reality.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:01:23
Andreas doesnt care about the community or logic just growing the value of the he coins he holds.

I appreciate the discussion, it has given me a lot to think about when working on improvements for the system.

We are working on a patch to implement add Greg Maxwell's Merkle approach to prove cryptocoin liabilities and it should be ready soon. We are committed to continually improving and updating our proof-of-reserves system. We do not believe it is either lazy or erroneous to try to provide information and soon cryptographic proof to make our system transparent as possible. While admittedly it is not perfect, that does not mean it is not useful. 
To be clear, we would be willing to open our books to a third party accountant we are committed to transparency. Right now our holdings are very small compared to larger exchanges and we feel our continuous proof of reserves system provides some value to our members.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:47:09
Excoin is ran by a team so there is not a single person behind it. The proof of reserves is still valuable even if our funds are primarily in hot storage. Our balances are very small compared to large exchanges and we do not want our users to have problems withdrawing their money instantly. We will be turning on our cold wallet storage system as our userbase , balances scale up and most importantly there is appropriate distribution of coins across accounts.

The financial institutions are are talking about do not exclusively hold cryptographic assets, so making the claim that because they do not have cryptographic proof of holdings and therefore that should be the standard for an entirely different system is incorrect. We are actually at an advantage because unlike the older institutions you are talking about we can use cryptography to help prove our liabilities. 
If you think what is on the page is simply counters you have woefully misunderstood what is being presented. 
To be fair, I will concede the point that uneducated people could be putting more faith in the current version than it merits, however this is solved by education, improvements and better cryptographic evidence ( This is not something we finished, its an ongoing project to try to refine and improve our proof of liabilities. 


You are discounting your own argument by listing abbreviations to make yourself seem like an authority and following it up with personal attacks. You are clearly trying to attack us and not actually help us provide a more transparent service to the community.
We have only been operating a short time, we are still building and have only recently started seeing substantial deposits in the past few days. Doing an audit before now would have been a practically useless request since our average daily volume was valued around 300 USD for most of our operation.


You just stated that it against the interest of our members without actually stating why.
How is it selectively releasing financial information? What is provided is full accounting of all of our cryptographic assets. It is disheartening that you have taken such a negative position without clearly learning much about our system or our company. You make it hard to have a dialogue when you continue make assumptions and claims without actually stating the reasoning behind them. 
Also if you feel that cryptographic proof of liabilities is bad, you might want to make the argument to Peter Todd since he has more sway in the community. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:44:44
It does not expose wallets of users because most transactions on an exchange happen in our internal accounting system and not on the blockchain. We will also likely be stacking the coins onto fewer addresses in the near future.
We go out of our way to protect our users privacy (not using twitter plugins, google analytics, google fonts) while trying to maintain as much transparency as possible.

@_date: 2015-01-06 13:55:29
Most exchanges do not provide you with real privacy unless you are using methods to specifically allow you to browse the internet anonymously. Practically every exchange uses google analytics/fonts, twitter widgets and other tools which assist in tracking internet usage.
Exco.in and all services provided by Blackwave Labs avoid all such tracking by not using those tools/widgets/services.

You should learn about the situation before offering you opinion (again would make the level of discourse go up), there was no court order. That was exactly the problem, it was simply a phone call from a congressman with no actual judicial pressure.
Also "the best technology providers of the century" is laughable. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:14:43
In the current system you are correct but there are yet undiscovered or under discussed engineering solutions to this problem.

Seems everyone is so quick to forget how AWS took down being wikileaks after the request was made by a US politician. That alone should be reason enough not to give amazon money.
Also AWS is the internet being slowly centralized, goes against the whole "decentralize everything" aesthetic. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:50:52
Our cold wallet addresses are registered but we have not yet moved funds into them yet because we do not want to affect the ability of users to instantly withdraw their funds. While the balances on our site may seem like a lot to the average user, our balances are very small compared to large exchanges. 
Excoin's accounting system will move funds into cold storage once there is a large enough balance with an appropriate distribution of coins.
@_date: 2015-01-11 06:11:28
The sentence "That alone should be reason enough not to give amazon money." implies I'm suggesting because of their actions with wikileaks that they are not worthy of giving money too. I'm not suggesting there would be a fear of AWS would be shutting them down. You should slowly read before replying, then the level of discourse would go up :)
