The [source for the article]( matches your claim. It looks like the author just decided to make a bunch of stuff up

Couldn't he just have mailed cash too?

He actually admitted to structuring. It doesn't seem like it's a crime until they can prove he did it to evade reporting.

Totally legit bro. Do you really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies? Especially when they could benefit financially from such lies.

You're missing the point, along with the other hypocrites in this thread.

I found the place. It was called 'Aperitivo' but it looks like it was shutdown/acquired.

No. You will probably end up losing money. Wait until it goes down and then starts to rise again.

No he didn't. He read bitcoin.pdf and moved on.

Since he's new to Bitcoin, make sure you give him an overview of the process so he doesn't get scammed via social-engineering. Someone could convince him that they need to use the tablet/POS device to "login into their wallet" or to "Sync their private key with the blockchain via Peer 2 Peer Satoshi protocol so that The Gibson miner can process his transaction". They could then install malware to display addresses they own and display fake successful bitpay messages.

If you were the victim of a random burglary, they would steal the computer because it looks valuable.

I wonder who that *someone* is
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:52:27
You're not the noob, OP is. He's the kind of person who would say "aw, so close" when losing a scratch off lotto card (where there is no such thing as being "close").


People say the same thing when they lose money on an investment. This whole post is pointless.

It's not just excitement, there's also a profit motive.

They probably dismissed you as some random stoner and gave you the go-to canned response.
*When will White Castle accept wampum as a payment method?*
*You guys should build moats around your restaurants and use catapults to fling burgers at people*

It would even be cool if they unofficially supported Bitcoin by creating easier ways to buy and trade [Steam Wallet gift cards]( They could create digital gift cards that are steam inventory items so you can actually verify that someone has one to trade.
Here's a reason they should support Bitcoin

Yet he suggested the dodgy place?
