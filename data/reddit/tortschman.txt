Bitcoin is backed by the energy output of almost three Chernobyl reactors to secure the network. It is counterfeit proof, divisible, scarce, easily portable, fungible and based on pure math. That's a lot more of what gold or Fiat can offer

I wanna/gonna load up there as well. But these BOT trading's are very likely to get ditched with a giant green candle

Constant fighting with the 50EMA until Q2 2019. Some major up ticks, some down ticks. Good time to accumulate. Confirmation (7Week) uptrend in Q3 2019 with final golden cross of 50Ema over 200ema. This will be the bull run kick start confirmation.

A colleague of mine who mined BTC in the early days, has lost his hard drive with 10,000 BTC. Not the guy from UK, searching for his HDD on a junkyard. 
But a rather similar story though. He bought a new HDD and can't find the old one with the wallets files anymore ��
