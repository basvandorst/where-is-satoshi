If bitcoin ever takes off as a popular way or international remittance I would be surprised. It seems very appropriate but that's only because western union etc charge a fortune for what could be done by any bank for a tiny fee. I'm surprised its still so difficult to move money internationally.

Yeah I guess it just baffles me that people don't set up bank accounts, they are basically free and you can withdraw money in the local currency anywhere there is an ATM for a much smaller fee than WU.

When one major exchange is down 66K bitcoin can do a lot of manipulating in the rest of the market. I wouldn't be surprised if this is just a whale taking advantage of the situation.
