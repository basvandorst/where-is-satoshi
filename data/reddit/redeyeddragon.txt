I am a bitcoin fan IF anything. Well more the technology behind CryptoCurrency. So sorry for not staying in all day.
Dont even get how you could think i was a dogecoin fanboy.
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:51:29
Wrong :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:37:47
Wow much hate
No but seriously... dogecoin will never replace bitcoins in society but it will help make all cryptocurrencies to grow. All publicity is good.  Especially now when dogecoin raised so much money for the sledteam.
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:53:37
Ofcourse dogecoin will soon be gone. But let them bring some publicity to cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:03:21
There is a lot of serious talk in And even more if you join ircs about dogecoin...
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:52:45
Okay you lost me somewhere there.
+20 doge
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:30:30
Cause ya know.. There is a meme here?
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:58:02
I might have missed all the great stuff we did but what was donated with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-10 18:09:53
Ive been with both communities since they started. Sure dogecoin copied bitcoin in technology. But the stuff around the technology is completely different. Also the dogecoin community has done more public good things.
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:38:40
Lol people are accually doing that? :O wtf... that is wrong.
Also wrong on you for talking shit about coins. why do you want any coin to fail?
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:23:28
You need to understand that there is a difference between a scamcoin and a copycoin. Shibecoin are trying to say they did most Of the things that dogecoin did. It also has been premined for like 20%. Id call it a scam before a copy.
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:01:46
the favicon? No it is not for me :(
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:33:44
Shibecoin is a scam. Why would anyone embrase it.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:11:10
Yes very unlikely:P
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:14:57
Doge will grow but one dogecoin will never be one BTC :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:41:21
Yea i dont like all Of the stuff dogecoin are now...
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:00:27
Dogecoin is as real and serious as btc :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:02:31
Cryptocurrencies are the future and not only one coin. Dogecoin is one among many. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:46:50
How about the fact that alot more people know about cryptocurrencies now?
I were mining bitcoins back in the day and have been with cryptocurrencies since then. I like all coins(almost) because i see a future with not only one coin but many.
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:51:08
No. Not nice sub. I thougt we were against hate.
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:00:46
He could probably already be that man.
Edit: such wow. Evil people. Downvote shibe :(
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:20:04
Since we still dont know who made bitcoin it could be bill gates or some other rich and powerfull dude!
@_date: 2014-01-07 11:18:20
That is a very nicely done phishing...
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:58:21
Why do you dislike dogecoin? 
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:40:18
Yes it does.
Why do you not like the joke? Its funny, its special, and awesome in all way. We already have mr super serious bitcoin :P
@_date: 2014-05-10 15:48:31
It is premined and trying to take cred for what the dogecoin community did.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:23:07
How is dogecoin worse?
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:04:22
Do you know how old the meme is? The meme is dead but the coin isnt. :) i dont see dogecoin as a meme...
@_date: 2014-04-27 14:59:47
This is very interesting!
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:25:30
You need to understand the difference between a scam and a copy. Shibecoin is effectivly scamming people.
Dogecoin is not a copy. the community and the value Of one coin is much better.
Also. Saying that dogecoin is a copy is like saying dollar is a copy Of pounds.

@_date: 2014-05-10 09:39:57
I'm extremely sorry that you have been treated like this! Hopefully it was only the minority treating you like that. +250 doge verify
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:26:22
Yes heavily. Like 20%
@_date: 2014-01-07 10:49:55
The world would have ended 50 times or something... maybe this time they are right...
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:40:41
It kinda is tho :/
@_date: 2014-05-10 14:02:29
In what way is dogecoin a scam?
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:03:51
Where there ever anything on it? it was gone before i got there.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:17:58

@_date: 2013-11-13 15:42:47

@_date: 2013-11-13 15:13:53

@_date: 2013-11-13 15:30:26

@_date: 2013-11-13 12:24:48
