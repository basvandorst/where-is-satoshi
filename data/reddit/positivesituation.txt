Um yes, TRX is already within 1.08 million wallets. Can you say the same about this garbage coin? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:27:36
Lol, no. There’s 100% no chance of this coin catching on globally. The greatest benefit comes from living in New York and that place is a shithole and is already highly overcrowded. This coin will die with 99% of the others.

I promise to spend it in the most wasteful way possible, and when I pay it forward, I will require the same out of whom I bestow it.
Also, would be fun to keep record so that I could see how far paying it forward repeats.

How do these posts even make it through? Anyone who things that there will only be 1 crypto that will drive all the others into extinction is a complete moron. That’s like saying that there will only be 1 True website on the internet and all of the other websites will disappear. While 90% of altcoins will disappear in 10 years, there will never be only 1 crypto.

Your English is obviously not very good. But from what I can make out of what you said I’m sensing a lot of tin hat scare scenario preaching. They can try and suppress the exchange in Japan, but due to the literal ubiquitous nature of the internet, there is always a way around it. Plus, their guidelines are completely ridiculous, they cannot require the largest exchange on earth to roll out KYC to customers just because they want to feel high and mighty and regulate crypto in their own way, especially when they are not even based in Japan. They have no power.

@_date: 2018-03-23 21:39:20
It’s not a problem, Japanese customers aren’t restricted to only using exchanges that are in japan. So when Binance moves to Malta, Japanese regulation does not apply to the exchange, which means there isn’t a problem, and Japanese customers can still use the exchange.

Of course, but if the other wallets only have the capability to store 1/3 of my coins then for me at least that is a huge deal.

Thats like saying in 1775, we don’t need a “new gold and silver”backed currency, because we *Have* continental currency. When the entire purpose of this new currency arising was due to the incredible depreciation continental currency had due to overproduction. The U.S. dollar now has the buying power of roughly 3.8c (in 2012) compared to its purchasing power in 1913, because for the most part it’s backed by nothing, we used to have a gold and silver backing for it but overproduction of the U.S. dollar has dwindled its purchasing power to nearly nil because it’s backed by the hope that the government provides value. Continental currency flew the same coop with its value eventually being exchanged at 1% of its intended value and look what happened, we made a new currency and its worked for nearly 250 years, well now this new currency is following the same path. It’s time to move on to the encrypted decentralized digital age of currency.

The point still stands that citizens can pay their taxes with cryptocurrency. It’s only converted to fiat because  state and federal institution still conform to the main mode of monetary exchange. Which at the moment is fiat. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:55:02
This man’s point is in saying that Cryptocurrencies serve no purpose. Which is 100% inaccurate.

So that there is one ledger of all patient records. As of now every hospital or hospital system (banner, etc.) keep their own records of each patient, which means if a patient goes to one hospital then later goes to another hospital the records from the first hospital do not travel with them and the new hospital has to try and patch together past medical history, allergies, etc. from asking the patient or family if the patient is incapacitated, or requesting the records from the other hospital which brings about it’s own issues. With a medical system ledger in place, all patient records would be accessible at every hospital on earth and the record could and would show all patient information cumulative from every hospital they have ever been to. Which means that there would be no loss of info between institutions. There is also a physician system for tracking pain pill/medication distribution called  “prescription drug monitoring programs”and some states are requiring physicians to use them to cut back on over-prescribing, but hardly any physicians actually use this system. With a distributed ledger, medication distribution per patient can also be tracked and there would be fewer drug/drug interactions as well as fewer over-prescription issues which contributes to limiting the “opioid crisis” that the U.S. has been going through. Also, an immutable ledger would contribute to record keeping if a patient feels that they should sue the hospital or nurse/physician responsible for their care. All details would be right there and accessible for the case and cannot be changed once made, thus if the nurse or doctor did their job correctly or incorrectly it will reflect in the records. Honestly there are several reasons to why a blockchain system would be beneficial in this field.

Click the “Exchange” button at the bottom of the app, and click bitcoin. Then convert the currency to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:34:19
The withdrawal button appears after you have converted your USD to BTC or any other crypto. First, you have to click the “exchange” button, choose BTC, then type the amount you want to exchange. Then after roughly an hour it will have finished the exchange and you can withdraw to an outside wallet.

@_date: 2018-04-22 17:47:29
Hey! I’m also a nurse, what do you think of medibloc or medicalchain? Really solves a lot of the endless charting if there is one centralized system for patient records.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:28:02
So you’ve already converted your USD to BTC? Then there should be a withdrawal button. If you haven’t converted it yet then you shouldn’t have to do anything with an address yet.
