Here's my theory- with the stuff that's coming out in the areas of smartlaw(proof of existence) &amp; smart contracts (ie ethereum), it's going to shift things in a large way - especially once these things are adopted or widely recognized by the bitcoin protocol/community. 
And when you consider that a business is nothing more than a bunch of contracts and transactions (high level here), we've opened up the door to wild new business models we have never seen before. 
my prediction? self-governing, decentralized, autonomous organizations are coming in the not-too-distant future.

yeah.  I agree. seems like a fruitless effort for this person.  Don't waste your time teaching old dogs new tricks.  Worry about housebreaking the puppies.
IMHO I think Bitcoin is already an "i told you so" kinda thing.  Why do I say that?  Because I was buying in @ under $100 (pre-Cyprus collapse).  I havent sent many "i told you so" emails.. they've been very rude "FUCK YOU, asshole.  I told you so.  You called me stupid.  I think you're just ignorant and lazy."
The only people I bother 'engaging' anymore are the people who have been outwardly combantant towards me over the sheer mention of Bitcoin (ie "where did you get this?" - "Oh I bought it online with Bitcoin" - "phhhht. what a fucking idiot!").  And again... I just reply that i'm up over 1000% in my portfolio and challenge them to outperform me with GICs or their "tax free savings account"

pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:57:53
could it be that maybe - because of the nature of this man's work that he's paranoid a bit.  sounds like he might have worked on some risky projects and some high-level security clearances?  could it be that he just had an unfortunate last name?
EDIT: I was born in Vancouver. Only born there, really. I lived in Ontario my whole life.  Never been back to Vancouver since I was a baby. I try crossing the Niagara Falls border into the US, and they pull me aside because a man with my name is wanted for break and enters in Vancouver.  2 hours later, they're able to verify that the guy is like 15 years older than me with teeth missing.

ahhh dogecoin - always riding coattails of others and trying to claim originality.  They're the apple fans of the cryptoworld.
