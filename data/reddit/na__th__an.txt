I would love to get a percentage of my paycheck in btc. The company o work for already supports putting a certain percentage of your check in a certain account so for many I think this would be easy to implement, especially if bitpay completes their payroll system.

Have you ever seen some people do AMA's? It's amazing how some people find ways to use technology incorrectly.

He also seemed to immediately understand the reddit interface and replied to comments, which few people do.

Nah you'd have spent your BTC on drugs.

Or just uninstall it completely from your computer. I did a while ago and really haven't missed it.

Seems the minimum bet is .01BTC, a bit high. I like playing at bitzino occasionally. They don't have nearly as many games but the minimum bet is 1 uBTC.

If it goes down to $2/BTC I know I'm buying a bunch no matter what.

He could be getting something less addicting like psychedelics, but still, OP should not be ordering drugs to his parents house.

Been using Dvorak layout for four years. So glad I switched. It keeps people off my computer and is much easier on my hands. I've had no wrist pain at all since switching, and I can still use QWERTY without any problems at all. Probably one of the most useful things I've ever bothered to learn.

I love the way the people of downvote a question without giving any information in a topic asking people to spread information about bitcoin.

Can you explain? I'm more of a bit coin lurker than anything else (although I have high hopes for its future), but I've only hears of the 3rd party escrow possibilities.

What does and doesn't constitute as fraud would be called regulations, would they not?
EDIT: People have been upvoting and downvoting this comment for 8 hours, but nobody decides to actually explain the difference. I see crap like that on this subreddit all the time. Mob mentality of "you're wrong" with no actual education or discussion.

I don't think SC2's popularity has peaked. The SC2 esports seen is still pretty big.

Ulbricht was living under a fake name and his roommates say he was pretty vague about what he did for a living. The roommates' descriptions definitely add up.

I've never used it myself but I've heard nothing but good things about cashintocoins.

There are rules, actually. Nothing is put on the road with the purpose of harming others, such as poisons, assassins, and weapons.
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:09:35
I wouldn't, just to be safe.

If they're willing to stop their cash flow completely, what they're doing will hopefully be worth it in the end and their service can start gaining some credibility. I've never had any problems using them, but they sure don't have a good reputation around here.

But, if I ever got bitcoins and wanted to use them as a currency, being able to buy things on Amazon would be great. 
I once gambled away .6 btc because I simply couldn't find a way to spend it (although I started with 2mbtc so I didn't feel bad).
