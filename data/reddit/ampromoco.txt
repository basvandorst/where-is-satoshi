It's not trustless at all. If a transaction is close to, equal to or lower than the cost to publish that transaction to the blockchain (i.e. the miner's fee) then that transaction is a 100% trust based transaction.

I find it hilarious that this thread is referencing two guys who control 50% of the hashing power and saying that BIP101 will somehow make this worse. Yeh I don't think you can get much worse other than by having 1 person control 50% of the hashing power. BIP101 has essentially no effect in comparison to 50% already being controlled by 2 people.

If this was true, we wouldn't be seeing the crappy propagation times that we have to day. I'm going to read more into the relay network but it seems to me that it only provides a boost for a small section of the propagation required to reach &gt;50% of the nodes.
This is from the official webpage of the relay network:


public Bitcoin P2P network. It is NOT any kind of attempt at
centralization, and I still encourage interested parties to establish
their own private peering agreements with large miners as needed.
Also to note is this:


order to keep relay fast, they do not fully verify the data they are
relaying, thus YOU SHOULD NEVER mine a block building on top of a
relayed block without fully checking it with your own bitcoin validator
(as you would any other block relayed from the P2P network).
Also important is this:


and may fail to relay some transactions/blocks. The relay nodes are NOT a
replacement for having peers on the standard P2P network, nor should you
rely on it as your only fast block relay method.
It seems to me the relay network is an excellent backbone to the bitcoin network but that it is that and that only.

This is a logical fallacy. Just because you cannot use bitcoin for every possible conceivable transaction does not mean it should be kept as small as possible. It should be allowed to grow as big as possible.
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:33:31
You're purposely taking what I said out of context and then are arguing some completely different point. 
The bitcoin subsidy is completely disconnected from btc-&gt;usd value. Btc to usd value increases significantly over time, much more than the btc denominated subsidy decreases, i.e. the effective subsidy has averagely always increased significantly over time. If bitcoin is successful then this will continue to be true for quite some time and therefore transaction fees will continue to be negligible for quite some time. The only way you can reconcile this issue is by believing bitcoin will not gain any more traction than it has now, or you believe transaction fees will become enormous.

Well if he really is Satoshi, it seems from what he was talking about during that bitcoin scaling conference talk, he's not too happy about people trying to change bitcoin into something else, nor is he happy that people aren't seeing the bigger picture with bitcoin and it's potential uses.
There are quite a few members of the technical community that are trying to veer bitcoin off into a very different path from Satoshi's vision and it is very possible he thinks it is now time to come back and try and correct it back onto the original path.

LN is bitcoin in the same way that Bitstamp's backend system is bitcoin. Both use the bitcoin network as a settlement layer and both handle transactions between two parties off-chain in a way than is more efficient than could be achieved directly through bitcoin. The main difference though is that LN does it in a way that forces a transaction/set of transactions to be published on the blockchain whereas bitstamp's backend system offers no guarantee of this.
This makes LN extremely useful for low value payments (microtransactions), trust-based payments or payments of significantly higher value than the miner fee required to publish it to the blockchain, but poor for payments close to, equal to or less than the cost to publish it to the blockchain.
I personally think LN will be great but I find it highly disingenuous to try and sell as a solution to everything, especially by saying LN = Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:09:50
Also, connecting to social networks is considerably easier because of all the simple APIs they use using standard protocols. No one even knows how a wallet will work with LN. It is all completely theoretical right now.

@_date: 2015-12-01 13:59:22
See this thread [HERE](
At 8GB blocks, without efficiency improvements, bitcoin will be able to handle 57,344tps. Current average non-cash tps globally is 12,357tps. Average non-cash transactions increase by around 7% per year. This would mean that by year 2040 it would be 67,067tps. That means that Bitcoin would be able to handle over 85% of ALL non-cash transactions globally. Add sidechains, altcoins, offchain and second layer networks like LN and you have more then enough capacity for every transaction on the planet and more.
VISA currently only averages around 2000tps.

Wow, thank you. That's very kind of you.


Well the real worst case value (if bandwidth and storage cost predictions are both completely wrong) comes in at about 18 days (in 25 years). This is quite a while to wait, I understand, but I offered a potential solution if this really happens. Retailers/bitcoin service providers could sell pre-bootstrapped storage that a user could plug in to their computer so that they don't need to bootstrap the blockchain themselves. They'd still need to verify the blockchain though for full security.


The proposal comes in under this limit anyway. Pruned node storage is obviously a function of non-pruned node storage which is the real bottleneck anyway.


Validation is taken into account. Thin/weak blocks and libsek speed up validation significantly. This is how such high speeds are reached.


Decreased full nodes by number would be negative, but decreased full nodes by percentage with roughly the same amount of full nodes by number should not be a problem for network health.


The schedule is tight because the reality is we are up against the limit of bitcoin's hardcoded throughput capability. User experience is going to degrade very quickly in the next 6 months and even more so after if nothing is done to implement a solution. The longer it takes to find a real way forward, the more likely it is that bitcoin will simply fail (imagine rearranging chairs on the Titanic as it sinks). This is the very reason people have been urging the community to find a solution for the past years, so that this situation did not occur. Yet here we are.


The first hardfork is the easy hardfork as it already seems to have community wide support. This is an excellent chance to use it as a kind of rehearsal for the major hardfork which will bring bitcoin out of beta and set it up for the future. The whole of 2016 would be used to work towards these two targets.


Serialised broadcast speeds up propagation through the network. Here is an explanation I gave to someone else.


If instead you broadcast a block to each peer one at a time, then the first peer will receive the block in roughly 1/8th the amount of it would have taken to receive it using parallel transmission. This peer can then start forwarding it to it's connected peers. This then continues with the second, third, fourth etc. peers. By the time the 8th peer has been broadcast to, all previous peers have already broadcast the block to many more peers.
Ordering these peers by available bandwidth and validations speeds, accelerates this even further.


I'm not sure what you are referring to here.

LN makes no sense for transactions that are close to, equal to or lower than the cost of putting a transaction onto the blockchain (i.e. the miner fees) unless you fully trust the other party. It says that if there is a problem with the transaction (fraud or whatever) then the transaction is sent to the blockchain, but if this transaction is close to, equal to or lower than the cost to add it to the blockchain, then the transaction has no security at all.
I.e. the more expensive it becomes to transact directly on the blockchain, the less utility LN has outside of fully trust based transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:44:10


Yes, because there are currently are large number of unstated conflicts of interest right now.


You conflating "interest" with "conflict of interest". Everyone has an interest/bias. Not everyone has a conflict of interest. You are specifically saying "Do X to help bitcoin" or "Don't do X to help bitcoin" while simultaneously being able to profit from bitcoin's failure (or degree of failure). That is very specifically a conflict of interest. Within essentially all academic practices it is a (moral and/or legal) requirement to state you have a conflict of interest. The fact that you refuse to state this outright I find extremely immoral.

Pruning is implemented but is rarely used. As far as I am aware, there is no UI interface for turning it on or controlling it.

8MB blocks means 28 transactions per second, 2,419,200 transactions per day, 883,008,000 transactions per year. If you split this between 70,000,000 users it means that each user get 12.6 transactions per year on the blockchain, or about one per month.
How can LN or bitcoin work if it takes a month to get a transaction published to the blockchain? How does this have any security? How is this user orientated? How big would the LN channels/hubs need to be to allow a user only 12 transactions on the blockchain per year (opening and closing 6 channels per year)?

It seems to me there are currently three main groups of data that need to be uploaded/downloaded.
A. Transactions downloaded from peers.
B. Transactions uploaded to your peers.
C. Blocks.
Currently the ratio of these is something like this on average A:B:C = 1:4:8 if you are connected to 8 peers. What this means is that you download all transactions once initially. You then upload all transactions on average 4 times to your peers (obviously not more than once to the same peer). Then when a block is found you then have to upload the whole block to all 8 peers. This block also contains all transactions for that block.
i.e. block upload is not 50% of your bandwidth because it is not a simple 50:50 ratio. It depends on how many peers you have.

Which is exactly what I predicted and explained in the proposal. The proposal allows for being off by more than 30% *every single year* of the scaling and still does not get worse than today. If the prediction is wrong by even more than 30% *consistently* then the proposal still gives many years for the code to be adjusted as a last resort.


This is very interesting. I have read about a number of non-silicon technologies recently that could take us into the teraherz computing speeds in the next decade. This isn't something we can rely on though of course.


Even if CPU throughput doesn't increase it should be possible for current CPUs to handle the max transaction throughput with 8GB blocks today in under one second using libsecp256k1. Propagation time would increase beyond the predicted levels but it would not exceed the limits I set.
For the other two possible bottlenecks (bandwidth and storage cost) there is a clear technological path forward to what is required. I think it's likely the VR industry is going to be one of the major influences on pushing these technologies forward due to it's data intensive nature.


Sure, nobody knows the future for sure, but I took this issue into account in the proposal.

My post was almost entirely about the problem though. The suggested solution is actually very simple.
Maybe you mean you want to know about the debate itself? This is much more difficult to describe, as it becomes very muddy. I believe it mostly comes from an ideology difference.

This would be a very similar situation to what we are in today (1MB blocks, half filled on average). Blocks currently contain on average 40btc of fees per day. So at 20MB block size limite and roughly the same around of pressure we could expect roughly 800btc in fees (by todays btc-&gt;USD price).

If the transaction amount is close to, equal to or below the cost of publishing the transaction to the blockchain then the transaction only makes sense if it is a trust based transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-14 12:19:57
After thinking about it a little more, if the value has one days worth of resolution (i.e. the value is only updated once per day) then the fees in dollar value will be over/underpriced by how much the exchange rate between each time the minimum fee is updated.
I don't see this as being a particular problem if the fees are low as bitcoin generally doesn't move more than 10-15% in value in a day and at most 50% in the most extreme and rare cases.
If say the minimum fee is $0.05 and the price of a bitcoin went from $200 - $400 then the max it would be wrong would be $0.05 (i.e. the fee would go from $0.05 to $0.10), which is not the end of the world. This is dependent on the miners adjusting the minimum fee value quickly though of course.
@_date: 2015-12-13 16:06:28

That would be true if the network was perfectly efficient and there were no leeches in the network, but it's not. As fas as I am aware peers can sometimes send transaction to their peers who already have them. Also I believe some peers leech off the network and don't forward the transaction.

How would this not be directly proportional to the size of the hub though? (i.e. hub twice as big = capital requirements twice as big)
@_date: 2015-12-13 15:22:50
Yes, the relay network makes it much more difficult to model this stuff without simply running a test net with lots of nodes across the world. Thin blocks will still have a huge impact even with the relay network as the first few hops are by far the most important in propagating a block.
On a kind-of side note, It is important to note the distinction between bandwidth required to propagate blocks quickly and the bandwidth required to propagate transactions. The bandwidth required to simply propagate transactions is still low today. It seems that if thin blocks were implemented right now it would get that upload bandwidth down to less than 2% of the total bandwidth available (When averaged across 10 minutes of course) of the average home broadband connection.

What? Bitcoin isn't an "unreleased hypothetical panacea" though.
@_date: 2015-12-28 10:04:54


I'm not sure what you mean.


Two reasons. Firstly, it seems many people agree that implementing Seg Wit via a hardfork is much more effective and safer. Secondly, it will act as a way of safely unfreezing the current attitude of 'no hardfork ever for any reason' with a hardfork that has no contention at all.


There's 2 different views on this: scale it like the internet, so scale fast, make trade-offs and try to disrupt it in 30 years. Or "lets not make the same mistakes as we did with the internet".
This is a strawman I am afraid. You asked 'What if all governments ban bitcoin?". I said bitcoin would already be a failure. Nowhere do I say anything about giving in to governments. The proposal specifically keeps bitcoin as government resistant as it is right now at a minimum.


I was also talking about full nodes (and pruned nodes since the data usage is the same). Monthly data for full nodes would not exceed 300GB until the year 2027.


My vision does not include this. *As a limit* I was willing to say the percentage of non-pruned full nodes could go down by some amount as the only service non-pruned full nodes are providing to the network above what pruned full nodes are providing to the network, is distributing the full backup of the blockchain. Even at a **maximum** cost of $600 when the network has hundreds of millions of users, there will be thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of entities with an incentive to store the full blockchain.

@_date: 2015-12-14 11:08:35


It's impossible to determine perfectly, yes. But it is reasonable to assume that it has arrived some time not long after it has finished uploading your end.
We don't need to have perfect information for when to start sending to the next peer. The more you separate the uploading to each peer the better (in this context) because the quicker a peer has the block the quicker it can forward it on.


This is certainly an interesting attack vector. This is only really applicable to the miner who actually finds the block though since this attack doesn't make much sense against the other nodes in the network.
In terms of the miner who finds the block, this attack vector could be solved by the following ways;
- Miner only sends to fast trusted peers first (relay network would fall under this category).
-  Miner uses some amount of parallel propagation for extra redundancy against the attack. (all other nodes use serial propagation though)


This solution doesn't tell you anything about how quickly the peer will be able to validate and then propagate the block though.
@_date: 2015-12-09 23:54:41

Right, but do you not think that it's reasonable to think there will be at least 6000 entities world wide willing to spend 16 days downloading to be able to run a full node, when the bitcoin transaction volume is 50% of the total global non-cash transaction volume?


I highly recommend looking into some of the thin/weak block proposals. My favourite so far is [subchains]( is technically a very beautiful proposal IMO. Also Libsek offers a significant validation speed increase.


The hardfork is not on a tight schedule because of the rehearsal. It's on a tight schedule because of reality. Blocks are full right now and the problem will only be worse in 6 months.


0.5 comes from using a simple scenario to compare parallel vs serial propagation. If you take the example of every peer connected to 8 other peers and every peer having the same bandwidth (obviously not a perfect representation of the real network). If you use the example of it taking 8 seconds to send a block to all 8 peers in parallel it means it should take around 1 second to send to each peer in serial.
If you assume roughly the same upload bandwidth is assigned to each peer, in the parallel propgation example the number of peers reached should be something like this;
- 8 seconds = 8 peers reached
- 16 seconds = 64 peers reached
- 24 seconds = 512 peers reached
- 32 seconds = 4096 peers reached
In the serial propagation example the number of peers reached should be something like this;
- 1 second = 2 peers reached
- 2 second = 4 peers reached
- 3 second = 8 peers reached
- 4 second = 16 peers reached
- 5 second = 32 peers reached
- 6 second = 64 peers reached
- 7 second = 128 peers reached
- 8 second = 256 peers reached
- 9 second = 512 peers reached
- 10 second = 1024 peers reached
- 11 second = 2048 peers reached
- 12 second = 4096 peers reached
As you can see, propagation time is actually more like 3 times faster using serial rather than parallel, but since it is just in an early concept stage I wanted to rather be conservative.
The 0.75 of ordered serialised broadcast is more of an educated guess if I am honest. I did some pen and paper simulations of the early stages of propagation to get a feel for the speed difference and it seemed to me to indicate a roughly 25% speed increase. Really to make an accurate estimate though, you need good data on what hardware the network is running on and what bandwidth is available to each node, and then you need to put this data into a simulation. I haven't had time to get to this point yet though.


No, bitcoin would not survive, not in any real sense other than for use in the black markets. If this is taken into account then we would simply be planning for bitcoin's failure, which has no point as scaling would be the least of bitcoin's worries.


This is another useful metric I agree. In this proposal monthly data usage for a node would not exceed 300GB until 2027. I think even Comcast should be able to keep up with that.


I have read some stuff about things like this but it seems these are such complex technologies, it's not worth building a plan around them as we do not know enough about them.

Lets take the example of 8 connected peers. If you broadcast to all 8 peer simultaneously (parallel) you will be sending to them, each using about 1/8th your available bandwidth. If you assume all peers take roughly the same amount of time to receive the full block (which they generally should since the bottleneck is likely to be your upload bandwidth rather than the peer's download bandwidth) then no peer can start forwarding the block until **roughly** all the other peers have also started forwarding the blocks.
If instead you broadcast a block to each peer one at a time, then the first peer will receive the block in roughly 1/8th the amount of it would have taken to receive it using parallel transmission. This peer can then start forwarding it to it's connected peers. This then continues with the second, third, fourth etc. peers. By the time the 8th peer has been broadcast to, all previous peers have already broadcast the block to many more peers.
Ordering these peers by available bandwidth and validations speeds, accelerates this even further.

@_date: 2015-12-13 16:01:31


I kind of understand. It seems there is a problem with that though. Let's say your connected to the relay network and you find out about a new found block and you stop mining the previous block and then start mining on top of this new found block. The relay network only propagated the block to the miners (connected to the relay network) quickly. If another miner who is not connected to the relay network found a block, and that block reaches more than 50% of the nodes in the network then all those miners connected to the relay network started mining on top of an orphaned block.
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:36:35
It seems you are mostly correct, although it depends on the number of peers you have I think. If you connect to 8 peers you will need to upload the block to 8 peers. Thin blocks reduces the amount of data having to be uploaded to each peer when a block is found. The ratio of data is something like this when you have 8 peers. **transactions_download** : **transactions_upload** : **block_propagate** = 1:4:8
This is using the assumption that you will averagely need to upload/forward transactions to half of your peers (4 in this scenario). As far as I am aware, thin blocks decrease the amount of data that needs to be sent when a block is found by between 10 and 16 fold. So that ratio goes to 1:4:0.5-0.8 which would mean it is a factor of 0.42-0.45. When connected to 16 peers it would mean a factor of 0.4-0.42.

Because someone somewhere has to pay for those transactions. The more non-fee paying transactions that go into the blockchain, the less fee paying transactions that can go into the blockchain.

It's a very interesting scenario. It seems to me that he may have now want to have been found. Why else would you stick yourself in front of a big bitcoin scaling conference, one that the whole community would watch. Why also would you leave all these clues everywhere.
Really IMO that leaves two options; It is Satoshi and he kind of wants to be found OR it's not but the guy is trying to pretend to be him.
The media are going to hound and hound him until he at least gives some response. If he is Satoshi and he wants to be found then he will come out and say he is. People then ask him to prove it which he then should be able to do. If he is not Satoshi but wants to pretend to be, then he will also come out and say he is. The difference though will be he should not be able to prove it.
Either way, It's going to be an interesting week for bitcoin.
I personally think it is him. It just fits to well and evidence is just too substantial. Also, from watching him talk at the conference, I actually want it to be him.

If you were a trader you would know that there are very noticeable patterns based on human nature. For example during a long-term/mid-term rally (especially when new ATHs are being made) when a psychologically important number is broken (100, 200, 500 etc.) it is proceeded by a small rally.
This is less true nowadays though as China is a significant driver of the market, which means the significant numbers based in CNY have more significance.

Multisig is part of the bitcoin protocol, so yes, it is bitcoin.


This is not a bitcoin transaction, no. I would not be able to ascertain whether you still have a copy of the private key or not therefore the transaction cannot be trustless.
Edit: For the people downvoting me, could you please provide me with information with how I was wrong in this post?

You understand you are holding two completely opposing opinions right? You are simultaneously saying that "bitcoin is a excellent store or value" while also saying "bitcoin is a shit store of value which is why no one is using it".
Stores of value can only exist if they have utility and are scare. If you remove bitcoin's utility as a payment system bitcoin simply becomes scare but has no utility. You can't claim a store of value will be supported when it's utility is "store of value". It's circularly logic. Gold will always have value outside of the "store of value" utility because it has a huge number of uses (malleable, non-reactive, highly conductive etc.) and is scarce.
I believe one of the reasons bitcoin's price is as high as it is already in this early stage, is because of a large amount of speculation on future utility. If we cast doubt on, or simply destroy, bitcoin's future potential as an effective payment system, I expect this the speculation on bitcoin's future value will disappear and so will it's "store of value" value.

Yes, you can buy on bitstamp. If you only intend to sell 30% of them then it is worth creating a wallet or paper wallet to store the other 70%.
I recommend you read the links on the side of this sub for information on how to make a wallet to send the bitcoins to. I recommend trying everything with low quantities of bitcoin first to make sure you know what you are doing.
If you have any further questions during the process, come back here and ask.

These guys have a current mining turnover between them of;
- 3240btc per day
- 97,200btc per month
- $1,279,800 (at current prices)
- $38,394,000 per month (at current prices)
This doesn't include income from fees or contracts.
Obviously their profit margins are just a percentage of this,  but even so, can someone please answer me this question;
In a worst case scenario, how could a marginal increase in internet cost due to BIP101 (even though it is designed so that there is *no* increase in cost) have any effect at all on the kind of centralisation we already have?
@_date: 2015-12-06 10:32:52
It also makes it MUCH more difficult to start using. Most of the people I introduced it to learnt about it by moving around small amounts of btc between addresses and wallets and stuff. No one's going to do that at a cost of $1 per transaction.

[Lightfield tech](
This is going to absolutely huge but it is going to need MUCH more bandwidth for users to access it. Lightfield cameras sense not only the colour and intensity of light, but also the direction. When used with a VR headset this allows you to construct a video that you can actually interact with as if it is really happening. The uses for this are truly mindblowing.
Imagine being able to pay $10 and go to any concert in the world that has ever happened (since lightfield tech was invented) and be able to experience it like you were actually there. This is an enormous value proposition for a consumer. This is also an enormous value proposition for a content maker as they can sell a concert/sports game to a much much larger audience.
Imagine when the cost of a high quality 360 degree lightfield video camera comes down to consumer prices and every household could have one. A video call using a VR headset could allow you to experience being in the room with people on the other side of the world. Even stranger is being able to view older videos. People in the future will be able to put on a VR headset and watch a lightfield video of them selves as a child or people who are no longer alive, all as if the experience is really happening.
The market is going to force ISPs to offer much much higher bandwidths than we see now to facilitate this.

By this logic moore's law was always dead before it even started. It's not being predicted by some crystal ball. It's being predicted by an intel engineer. There are literally no better people in the world at knowing what future tech developments will be made to achieve smaller transistor sizes.

There is an enormous difference between 7nm and 14nm. That's not a doubling of density either. That's a quadrupling. Also, it ignores changes transistor technology beyond just transistor size.

The diameter of a silicon atom is 0.1nm that means at 14nm you could fit 140 atoms of silicon across and 19,600 atoms in the area of the transistor (likely much more in the volume). Unless you consider 140 or 19,600 "several", you are wrong.
