EXCEPT, proof of work is unsustainable long term.

Bitcoin mining rewards halve every 220,000 blocks. 
This next one happening in 2020 from about 12 bitcoins a block to 6.
According to economist.com:
Alex de Vries, a bitcoin specialist at PwC, estimates that the current global power consumption for the servers that run bitcoin's software is a minimum of 2.55 gigawatts (GW), which amounts to energy consumption of 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year—almost the same as Ireland.
So apparently the current power being used to mine bitcoins at the current rate is about the same as the energy consumption of Ireland. What do you think is gonna happen when the reward halves?
More mining power will be needed to generate the same number of coins, aka more electricity. Not to mention if bitcoin does go up in price this only further drives demand for mining as people will seek to make profits that way only again furthering the amount of electricity needed to mine 1 bitcoin. 
As you can tell, with very little world adoption bitcoin is already using a nation's worth of electricity. Unless the world drastically improves on the energy consumption front(possible but if bitcoin is relying on this for future success then good luck with that, expecting 2 revolutions in industry for support) proof of work is not a sustainable long term mechanism for mining and therefore minting new bitcoins. 
I am not an expert this is just my 2 cents, and before anyone wants to jump down my throat because I disagree with consensus on this subreddit, I welcome healthy conversation

And so it begins....

All right. However is bitcoin energy consumption going to increase or decrease or stabilize going forward? That is the main issue. If bitcoin consumption now is the same as Ireland, then would it not be exponentially more in the future if bitcoin grows exponentially in adoption and price? And is this sustainable? Without a energy revolution?

The irony in your statement is that bitcoin itself is not decentralized either...... the top 113 addresses hold 20% of all bitcoins.......the top 1,600 addresses hold 40% of all bitcoins. And yes a few of the top addresses are exchanges, but that is still GLARINGLY centralized.
Another way to look at it is the majority 89.03% of bitcoin addresses hold ONLY .86% OF THE TOTAL BITCOINS AVAILABLE. Ya lets continue pretending bitcoin isnt centralized either.

90 percent of us only own less than 1% of all bitcoins! What the heck?!? Can someone help me understand how this isnt bad?
