Of all the things you could do with your money, invest in Netflix, amazon etc,  start a small business, start a hotdog stand or single room rental buisness with little money and grow it. or do all those things and build your empire.  but what do these guys do? send their paychecks to internet virtual gambling.  and that's what it is, gambling not investing.     Investing is giving capital to a CEO who you have decided knows how to make it grow.   Crypto is more like telling everyone on your block to put their money into a virtual pot, then there all going to take out more than they started with somehow.  there's no product here to make money it means someone else had to lose money. I just dont understand why they can't see this.
my microsoft stock not only keep going up because they uses that capital to make products, it pays me a big fat dividend cheque every quarter ontop of that.   Don't get me wrong the vast majority of people I know, know how to invest, only a few got caught in the crypto, but it's still frustrating to watch

God you guys are morons. I mean seriously fucking retarded.

I’m a computer engineer by trait and education, even though I don’t do it much anymore. Yes I was around when btc was first coming out and I know quite a bit of the technicals.  Again you guys are personifying what everyone says, You have no in hearing anything but positive words, that’s not a good way to invest.

your point is moot because anything can be manuipilated, just because crypto is manipulated in a different way doesn’t mean it’s different.  Btc is too small for most Wall Street guys to care about but if they wanted to manipulate it they could just like any other
Invest in real estate if you are genuinely worried about market manipulation.

I don't have a stake in BT, the fact that you vehemently argue against discussion shows your not very secure, and yes you talk logically like a moron, sorry that's the facts. I don't care what you do, and if anything you are furthering this not me, I deleted the post 5 minutes after I made it cause you all act like a bunch of toddlers. leave.

Follow a lot of alex jones do you?
Again without knowing your situation, I guess my point is moot too, but I'm looking at buying a small 12 suite apartment complex, I'm finding it almost impossible to lose money on that deal but potential pay off for the rest of my life, whats btc going to give you? possible upside possible loss of all money? mind as well go to Vegas.

You know guys I’m just speechless. If I went on any other financial forum people want to talk about the positives and negatives of any  market. But you guys instantly attack anything negative, and not only that but with ad hominems. You personify exactly what people say about you. 
Stopped? I got my degree in 2001, since then I have changed careers.  Anyway yeah you guys are brainwashed. I suggest mortgaging your house an putting it all into crypto. Have a great day

This isnt really how it worked.  Microsoft could easily (and has) made a linux version and made money off it, RedHat alone had 3 Billion dollars revenue last year.   Ballmer poopoo'd linux cause it's a direct competitor, just like pepsi has poopoo'd  coke-a-cola, are you really surprised by this?
We also don't reeeeally use Linux on our phones, we use an operating system Google paid a billion dollars to have developed which uses a modified linux kernel.
I'm also not sure why you think this is sociopathic, you know a CEO can be held legally responsible if he's shown to make decisions that don't' make as much money as possible for the shareholders, he's not there to bake cookies.
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:15:49
well ballmer is ballmer, a big sweaty guy who "also own'd a suit". I'm not saying he doesn't get excessive, but I also don't want to live in a world where we penalize people for who they are, it's worked for him.

I couldn’t have said it better myself. You guys are all brainwashed. I don’t say that to be mean I say that to stop you guys from sending your savinging away. 
When your front man is guys like mcafee, one of the most crooked scammers ever to exist on this earth (his entire life is one scam to the next). And other scammers that have gone legit like Jordan are telling you to stop, it should at least make you think.  
A friend of mine has got his entire family (wife, young daughters) to give their money up to bitcoin, that’s the kind of thing you never see in real investing. You do however hear it at the start of pyramid scam documentaries.

Pretty much? Are you sociopathic? I make a healthy amount off investing each year enough to buy me luxury suvs and have a happy life, so I like the market to work and reward diligence, I don’t like the market sucking people in and taking their savings. It’s not healthy. I’ll admit BTC is a fart in the financial world, It’s entirety isn’t even worthy a single wallstreet fund, but nonetheless it’s not good for the market as a whole. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 18:40:50
you honestly talk like a moron, I mean I just don't even know what to say to you anymore.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:29:40
I said guys like mcafee, and He is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most publicized and outspoken figures in the crypto world.
Yeah I TOTALLY AGREE the problem is it’s a lot of people’s stupid mistake.  
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:17:30
This is exactly what I mean, when people give there honest thought on bitcoin that arnt positive, what happens? it gets down voted. 
Any other investments I have I always watch for the good and the bad so I can make an informed decision to buy or short, but all you btc guys seem to want to hear is up up up. Since btc has no product you can’t all ‘make’ money all it can do is shift money so for you to get rich someone else has to get poor. That’s just the way it works folks. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:09:54
Yeah I agree, but with markets it’s it’s typically informed and linear.  Also markets have a product and inject capital into the ecenomy as a whole, you are trying to ride that wave.  Currencies ideally would never move they are just an intermediat Where as btc is neither. 
Also did they actually lose? Or do you just mean the dip? Cause the market came back pretty quick, I remember not being worried. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:39:40
Wow. You guys are fucked.
