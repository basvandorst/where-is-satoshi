beware the spec of monarch you saw on the website may not be the performance of the monarch you get, neither the hash power nor the power consumption. If you get your monarch on time in march 2014, ok maybe in march 2015 (lol, you still have a chance to receive a miner which doesn't works as estimated. So why not  just buy some btc and hold it, in which way stands low risk, the exchange rate is there.

Moreover, I would like to add some information. CT told us they'll give us 2 TH/s each miner and now it's 1.675 TH/s. And most of all ,the power consumption, which is 0.6 Watt/GH, now it's 1.2 Watt/GH. (They said the total power consumption is between 1900W and 2100W, so I just take average and devided by 1.675 TH/s)
In fact, when we ordered this rig in September, the power consumption of Terraminer IV was 1200W. But now they change the spec from 1200W to 1650W. Do I miss something? And how dare Cointerra claimed that it's typically 20% higher than our anticipated target of 1650W. It was 1200W, dude. And it's now typically doubled the Watt/GH !
Less Hashing power, more power consumption, and the worst of all, LATE DELIVERY. Cointerra has not ship anything yet. They told they will do it next week but honestly I don't know.
So far their 1.2 Watt/GH Terraminer is not better than KNC Mercury or Saturn. I really don't know why CT spent so much time and still cannot design a miner better than KNC did.

Yes. Yes. And that is to say customers should not buy any pre-sell miners. Only buy those already in stock and will ship immediately. Otherwise there will be scams everywhere. 
Don't trust in those Pre-sell companies, most of them are liars.

really disappointing. For new comer who wants to get their first miner, DO NOT BUY FROM COINTERRA, or you will be as regret as me.

I'm a Taiwanese and a bitcoiner. Serious I don't think Wayi will success in this field. First of all we don't have a convenient platform to trade bitcoin in Taiwan. Once people in Taiwan buy some bitcoins, it's hard to exchange to NTD$ again. So the only way is to spend it. However, the second point comes, Wayi's online shopping mall, which is called Wmall, nothing good stuff in there. If you don't believe me, just look around [Wmall]( . Very bad revenue before. I don't think chinese people will spend their bitcoin in Wmall...they'd rather hold their coins. The only way that will change my opinion is that Wayi decides to make a full function bitcoin exchange platform like Mt.gox. And if wayi do like this,,, I'll thumb up for that!

So now we have BFL and Hashfast. Which next?

just checked Wmall today, really inventory increased. I bought two 21oz raw Sirloin for 0.0282BTC, lol.

that's probably not gonna happen. Bitcoin is designed to attach other currency, it cannot live alone because its slow trading speed. People still need a currency which can be used under daily instant trading occasions. But if US dollar crashed, and the global economy is still fine, that means US is not so powerful as now or you can say US is crashed, but the rest of the world are ok, then we can go to the conclusion that people of United State want to put their money to other asset and bitcoin is just one of their choices. People can still choose RMB or other country's currency or stock as their asset. So there would be a price rising in bitcoin also the other currency, that dilutes the price rising in bitcoin.
