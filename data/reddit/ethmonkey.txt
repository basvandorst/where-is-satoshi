If anyone has a 6-7 figure account etc  a 36% Loss is disastrous, the tokens should be at least given in larger quantity s to people who will obviously not be made whole for years etc... 
Either that or use bfx money for the bailout, using customer funds means the biggest losers won't be made whole for years and like any loan, the longer the terms the higher  the  interest rate would be...... Providing people don't get impatient and start their own legal proceedings...

Any liquidation would tie up all asset classes for about 5 years..... But 36% is a bit steep.... They should dig deeper if they wish to avoid lawsuits, even if it means taking a loan or leaning on bitgo for help in this colossal fuck up that bitgo countersigned
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:09:12
there is only 1 thing that can happen ,the site is either insolvent or it isnt .....in which case not a penny can leave until ALL assets are divided ,regardless of their sub class ..........
some wallets get a refund and some dont is simply not the way this works ...........
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:09:53
if anyone else has had enough of the bfx scam .....there are other options 
bitfinex has assets such as shapeshift etc that could be liquidated to pay us ......the lawyer will tell you the details ..
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:46:17
No, your not the only one
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:52:39
no way will i settle for anything less than 100%.......63% haircut and some shitcoins is not going to cut it ...........
they can either pay or they cant ......i will join any legal action that removes control of bfx assets if they think they can refund some customers but not others .........
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:06:14
its already going to happen .......its inevitable so you may as well put your name on the list 
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:26:59
If you are willing to accept the scraps being offered that's up to you, I will not be accepting less than 100% and if they don't have it the creditors will divide ALL assets  to distribute them, unfortunately that may include more people but it's how liquidation works...
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:50:04
which ones ?
@_date: 2016-08-14 12:21:47
He thinks bfx wouldn't cook their books..... How cute...
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:24:27
No, not really 
Zane said they have NOT lost all the bitcoins 
So the remaining btc +usd+eth+ltc+etc  and some money from the companys pockets  might bring everyone up near 100%...
Maybe they could get bitgo to chip in as they're supposed to be involved for their "expert security in the industry".... 
If it's an inside job which it kinda would be hard to be anything else some people should be looking to avoid prison at the moment....

date only makes the sync faster ,if your wallet is only say ...6 months old ,then it would use the date stamp to sync from 6 months ago 
if you dont have the date stamp ,it will still work fine but sync from the genesis block so it might take 20 min instead of 2-3 etc

I would recommend Watch a YouTube video of how to make a secure paper wallet, buy from reputable companies  and transfer to the paper wallet...... And then relax and read about bitcoin at your leisure 
I've been reading since 2011 and there's still a lot I don't know because things are constantly evolving ...... 
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:23:05
But they already have done  so..... 
They could make it illegal to have exchanges in the USA if they wanted to.... 
Ban American customers from sending money to international exchanges simply by closing their accounts... 
It wouldn't kill bitcoin but it would put the USA at a considerable  disadvantage when China, Russia and Europe are ballzdeep in gold 2.0

Btc is much  less risky than it was before, in the early days people thought I was nuts putting my savings into btc when it was $3 - $10range 
 While they bought traditionally "safe"  investments like property and gold.... And many ended in tears when the property crashed hard etc.... 
Goldbuyers faired slightly better but I think this is the best opportunity for the remaining sceptics to get on the train before prices go to $2-5k and after that it's moontime so whole  bitcoins will only be available to the rich and wealthy 
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:12:34

there is also electrum cold storage ,install on a cold/air gapped  machine and sign txs on that ,copy to usb stick and broadcast from a "watch only"  electrum wallet ..........
a bit more hassle but your private keys are not exposed to  the internet machine and you get your 12 word seed to  recreate in the event of hardware failures or theft etc 
there is also the option to use multisig  and 2FA by TrustedCoin built in  ,depends how much convenience youre willing to  sacrifice for security and obviously the amount of btc at risk ......

and i thought i had lost it all ,i was in shock but after a couple of stressful days of  heavy drinking and popping valium to calm down  and trying numerous backups i finally  found one i could unlock with a password that worked ........i think i may have been using the corect phrase but possibly that particular  wallet file corrupted

I think coins in properly generated (offline etc) cold storage with encryption are about as secure as it gets... 
I would not keep hundreds or thousands of btc in a hardware wallet either as the firmware is another attack vector and you should never trust the code 100% unless you have examined it yourself

It's a  win/win deal for Elon because he gets to offload the cars to a new community and he's wealthy enough to hodl the btc until the price moons if he wants to, it would also be great publicity for both tesla and bitcoin when the media covers it...... Just need to get his attention! ��

I buy more weekly since 2011,regardless of price, in 2020,2024,2028 the cash i spent will have lost most of its purchasing power and the btc i have will be going in the opposite direction driven by scarcity so it's an easy choice for me

Overstock ceo Patrick Byrne, virgin galactic boss Richard Brandston etc have been willing to accept btc since 2014  but they're so loaded they can afford to gamble , i have spoken to local merchants in my area about it and they think btc volatility is  too risky and not enough people will use it to make it worthwhile etc...

Not really, the difficulty in a couple of years will have risen significantly and the reward halfening is next year so it's probably safer to buy the best ASICS now and reap as much as you can before the block rewards gets cut in half than wait 2 years if history is anything to go by

to combat this ,i normally send $10 to a new wallet 
and try to send $5 back out to ensure it works 
providing that goes ok ,then i attempt to restore the wallet on a new machine from one of the  backups ,if it restores and i can see and spend my wallet on the restored version then and only then do i send the bulk of my cold storage ....
i dont need or want a trezor because im a long term hodler since 2011/12 and dont intend to sell anytime soon
