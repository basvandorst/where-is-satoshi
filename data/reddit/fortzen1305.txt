So when you talk about encrypting Electrum, do you mean putting it on an encrypted container or the entire drive that it is on? This was one of the things I have been confused about because on a dualboot system, it's not as simple as doing FDE in truecrypt.

Hey, thanks. I appreciate your quick reply.

Thank you for this reply. I understand that I cannot have my private key on any of my partitions, which, I guess, is why I created this post. Some of the forums I went to said to use FDE on the system running the wallet. That simply isn't an option for my machine nor is downloading the entire blockchain. I still want to explore bitcoin because I believe in it and want to use it to pay for VPN's. I just don't want to have my BTC ripped off, as I'm sure you understand and want to know the best way to keep my wallet safe and secure.

Awesome! Thank you for your quick reply. Much appreciated

Awesome. This helped so much. I'm not looking to very have much in BTC, just small amounts for online purchases.

Hey man, thanks for the help. I certainly missed out on making money hand over fist. Wasn't sure about BTC in the beginning and I was dead wrong and I've been apprehensive to get into it because I don't want my taxes to turn into a complete clusterfuck. Your post has helped me tremendously in answering those questions. 
On an aside, I told my Dad not to long ago about how long I've been watching BTC and that I really screwed up by not buying a bunch at the time when I was considering buying. He said he had the same feelings about buying stock in Walmart. Now our family doesn't shop at wallyworld, but he really regrets not buying that stock. We had a good laugh about it.

Maybe 'monitoring' is a more appropriate word. Haha

It's not that I don't want to pay the taxes, it's that from what I've read every transaction has to be taken into account as to the value of the BTC at the time and how much the person paid for the BTC. If someone does a lot of transactions, that really seems like a nightmare to track the value of it at each transaction, if what I've researched is true. So it's not that I am not wanting to pay, it's that I don't understand how to accurately report it on my taxes. In a few years I'll be not only making a considerable amount of more money, but I'm also going to be opening a business so my taxes are going to be scrutinized more than they are currently and I can't seem to wrap my head around this tax issue. Maybe you can clarify if I have misread about that?

Hey I appreciate your reply. That's a fantastic idea. I never thought about that but I'm certainly going to do that. Thanks a bunch!

It's more that I've read that each transaction has to be reported with how much the BTC was worth at the time of the transaction and how much I bought it for. If someone does lots of transactions, that seems like a tedious thing to do.

Yea I mean it's only a few dollars now but I am planning to start buying more BTC as I can afford it. Of course I'll probably put a bunch in cold storage but just thought I should figure this out before I start really buying more. Thanks for your reply.

This is what I ended up doing. I figure I'll just keep a few dollars in coins on mycelium and have my Electrum be my main wallet. Thanks for the help. It's very much appreciated.
