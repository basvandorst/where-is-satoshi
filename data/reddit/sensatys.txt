Don't be too harsh to the guy. In any case he admitted being a criminal, so it's up to you to decide whether to give him a downvote or a donation.

A friend from Germany wrote me that they are developing some kind of a machine for deciphering and encrypting messages. What an interesting idea! I can only imagine that some time in the future it can become a network for encrypted communication or even something better, like money. Alas, one can only dream!

It's because they issue gov money aka dollars, euros etc. They need to know how hungry you are for the paper money. They want to own you.

There is abundance of everything on this planet for every person to survive and live a normal life. Our needs can be satisfied.
The key word in this quote must be "want". Our wants are made up, inflated by advertisements, and this economy on drugs.

Chart showing Bitcoin as a bubble does not make sense. First of all, Bitcoin is a technology, an exponential one, which is being adopted, like internet, radio. Only then comes speculation and price.
