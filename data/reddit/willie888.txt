Go to [CoinATMRadar]( and find an ATM near you. Deposit cash, have your wallet QR code ready on phone, and check that it went through. Easy.

Don't have a word missing.... substitute a word in seed for a meaningless word then nobody could tell.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:56:00
Meaningless could be from the list.

Quite a remarkable dropping of the curtain moment.

They aren't less interested, it's just *different* interested. Less bragging. More about the human relationship side of things, like it's use in commerce.

I've never heard of those three experts

Varies. Check with specific provider.

Here's a [good website for paper wallet.](

Years of fiat brainwashing perhaps.

You have to be 18 to invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:30:48
The whole point of bitcoin is remove middlemen.

Find a crypto ATM nearby and off you go -

BitRocket ATM $10,000 daily limit.

Who cares? I think OP is focusing on the gesture rather than the value. I would create a cold wallet and transfer funds. Then hand them the paper wallet (maybe even inside a new leather wallet).

There are a few options:  
* [Local Coins]( - but be careful!
* [Bitcoin ATM]( - check they do sells, many do buys only

Local Bitcoins is your only option until ATMs will buy as well as sell.

Might I remind you that Vietnam is a communist country.

+1 for BitRocket ATMs in Sydney and Melbourne and a couple other spots. Look them up!

VPN does not encrypt data. It just obfuscates your location.

More important chart would show crypto as % of total investments.

Dude anyone can own bitcoin, even a mendicant monk in the hills of Thailand.

I don't know but Marty McFly bought some Ethereum in the 80's, or so the rumour goes.

I don't know enough to answer this, and if I had a Satoshi for every other person who should say that but still offer an opinion then I'd be a rich mofo. 
That leaves the answer in the hands of the one person I trust the most from the Bitcoin community .... Erik Voorhees. And his opinion can be found on his blog.

Blockchain is a non-custodial wallet so there is no entity that can lock you out of your wallet. If you follow their suggested practices you should be fine keeping BTC in the wallet. 
Have you backed up your Blockchain wallet yet? If you did then you will have a 12 word phrase that allows you to recover your funds in the case of any issues. It should be written down and kept somewhere safe. This is the 'recovery seed' that allows you to generate private keys when you need to.

You are correct. For some reason I thought VPN only masked IP. It encrypts before it gets sent from computer and right after it is received. That's a cool feature :-)

My dog could even buy some dogecoin!

Bitcoin. Sketchy. Nah really?

Sure why not. If you predict growth then that strategy works fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:30:05
Yeah u make a good point: especially when you hear everyone at work talking about it. I reckon 5% own right now. Plenty of room for uptake growth. And supply is limited so there is a simple formula for price over time.
