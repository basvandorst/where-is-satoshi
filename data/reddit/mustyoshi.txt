I don't see why all banks couldn't create a blockchain to handle their interbank movements.
But I can think of reasons they wouldn't want just anybody able to "mine" on their chain.

Most people only need like ~~4-5 GB~~ 1.4GB as of block 427111 of it (the utxo set).
You only need utxos to spend, everything else is just for historical purposes.

So 12.5k bitcoins so far this year in btc fees. Assuming traders have it set to take fees in btc (you can choose). At that rate, you're looking at 5+ years to get the 120k back. And that's not taking into account ltc or eth, but also expenses.

Dual Xeons L5520, 2.27ghz 16 threads. 24gb of ram.
Pulled the 0.13 branch about 8 hours ago.
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:30:58
Imo the market cap should really only include coins that are actively participating in the market. So it would have dropped by like 120k*600 following the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:47:27
I believe in crypto, I'm not sure Bitcoin is going to be the only kid on the block forever though. Until altcoins turn into sidechains, I'm reserved to thinking something better may come along.
@_date: 2016-08-14 00:12:36
The whitepaper also explains how easy it would be to mitigate the mining portion of the coin if you fell victim to it.
Sidechains are going to have very interesting proof of works, this is just the beginning
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:57:56
That's implying that the victims held all their coins in one basket.
I only lost less than 5% of my worth. Down to like 2% after the haircut.

Huh, yeahhhh, I was pulling like 220mbit/s.

Or use electrum, I'm almost certain you can import a bitcoin-qt wallet into electrum.

I foolishly didn't setup 2fa because of my bot at the time. But something tells me even if I had 2fa (it was only for logging in) that I probably still would have lost money.
@_date: 2016-08-21 11:55:42
120k Bitcoins is about 1% of the current supply (an even larger percentage if you're only counting for "active/incirculation") So you're not really comparing apples to apples.
When a bank gets robbed, it's a literally negligible amount of money compared to all the money in existence, any single branch of a bank probably has less than .01% of their total deposits in physical cash (let alone what the robber or robbers are able to carry away). And that's not even to say how small a percentage of the total supply of USD is.
That's why it's a big deal, it's a huge uncertainty, and the price right now isn't driven by average users, it's driven by traders.

Pretty soon the distinction between a full node and an archive node will be important. I run an archive node fwiw.

In that case I'd say that the fee is your cost for convenience. :/
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:59:42
Ah yes, a trustless p2p network that has to rely on the goodness of miners when mistakes happen.
Even more ironic since if the mining scene was more decentralized it'd be very difficult to reach out (or publicy shame) the miner in question into returning the fee.

I always use custom UA, usually referencing my username on the site or otherwise when I scrape.

@_date: 2016-04-16 03:17:08
Don't like it? Don't do business with them.
They are a US based company and therefore have to follow US regulations. Bitcoin is full of some of the most privacy endorsing people ever. Coinbase would not be doing this if they didn't have to.
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:16:49
One way would be to give your descendants private keys, or in some way derive private keys from shared knowledge that will be given to them at some point.
And create a timelocked transaction (set to a future, but not too far) that will spend your cold storage to those addresses, include it in your will (via hex printout) or have it already broadcasted, and just move your coins periodically and update the transaction.
@_date: 2016-04-26 20:38:43

Aren't debit cards us holding our money electronically? 
@_date: 2016-04-27 06:27:23
No, I just think it's funny that the only reason we can reverse these mistake fee payments wouldn't be possible if mining was as decentralized as everyone wants.
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:17:34
Centralized mining farms are more efficient than decentralized mining.
The lower latency means less wasted hashes for that farm, and a marginal increase in profitability dependent on their percentage of network power.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:19:04
Oh wow. So probably not that economical to have a bleeding heart anymore.
@_date: 2016-04-18 10:46:30
Arbitrage between what?
Edit: What's to stop people from setting up an amazon seller, wishlisting your own item for a 10-20% discount, then just releasing the funds? Since you're basically selling to yourself there's no need to even ship anything? That's an instant 10-20% (minus amazon fees) premium way of selling BTC.
Edit2: Dang Amazon takes a ton of fees. You'd need to pretend you were selling personal computers for the low 6% fee. 8% for consumer electronics.

Let's not blow over the fact that so long as your channel is open you need an oracle (yourself or somebody you pay) to watch for misbehavior in relation to your channel.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:19:25
Only gains in USD are taxable.
Buy 1 BTC for 1000 USD, buy 10 ETH for .1 BTC each.
So you've got 10 ETH worth 1000 USD, when BTC drops to 900,  but ETH stays 100 USD, you buy back into BTC for 1.1 BTC worth 1000. So you've gained 10% in BTC, but if you timed it right, you had little or no realized USD gain.
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:59:25

@_date: 2018-01-19 01:34:08

@_date: 2018-01-14 18:04:16
It can only grow 8x as fast, so the Bitcoin chain would have to be at least 8x as small.

Fees will be driven to zero anyways.
@_date: 2016-04-11 23:18:37
Competition drives prices down and innovation up.
So it depends what you think Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:07:53
Yeah, so you make trades that result in no gain of USD, but result in gains of BTC. It's pretty easy in this sideway market.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:11:48
It's the one where you try to use your copy of the transaction that gives you more of the coins.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:13:45
It may also hit 5k
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:21:02
BTC is their biggest volume. Let's just assume the over pairs/margin funding come out to another 12.5k, that's still 2-3 years of *revenue*, which says nothing about expenses.

@_date: 2018-01-19 02:01:31
I wonder if we'll get to the point where it's too expensive to close a channel?
Or too expensive to move bitcoins off the exchange you purchase them on? At 50k per Bitcoin, even at 10 sats per byte, it will cost over 2 dollars to open a payment channel.
It just goes up from there, it will become too expensive to move bitcoins to a private address for most people.
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:20:44
How do you figure segwit doesn't break the chain of signatures?

@_date: 2018-01-26 23:07:00
~~Has anybody executed a channel closing attack yet?~~
EDIT: I think I was mistaken about the technical details of the payment channels. I thought both parties had a full refund transaction signed and ready in case the other actor misbehaves.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:59:12
Too bad the only metric regular people care about is Fee/kB.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:22:00
You only pay taxes when you realize a gain.
Just use fancy crypto-crypto trades to increase your BTC holdings while realizing minimal gains or even losses in fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:24:29
Daily reminder that even if fees are 10sat per byte, it will cost 2 dollars to open a channel for every 50k usd that Bitcoin is worth. For small purchases it will still be uneconomical to use Bitcoin for small amounts.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:57:53
Now is the time to start reducing the utxo set
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:41:14
That's a lower bound with a very conservative price growth.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:22:18
And yet the costs are still cheaper than a traditional broker. Try making money on a balance of 100$ at etrade.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:41:00
Segwit decoupled signatures from blocks. An attacker could use a varient of selfish mining to make it expensive to verify segwit data.
Thus making it possible to spend segwit without signatures.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:14:48
Hmm I wonder how hard it'd be to parse the chainstate folder. I ended up running a pruned full node, it's currently on block 355k.

Only 85? Those are rookie numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:28:50
I guess I had some panic back in the day and make market orders. Thankfully only about .1 BTC total.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:42:16
Oh sure, you lost a million dollars, but the 2 million you have left is still a significant amount.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:15:22
I'm sorry, but Lightning alone is not the solution.
Lightning can do absolute wonders between big wallets that do lots of transactions between eachother (exchanges mostly, but that may require privacy implications to be addressed). But it still requires you putting up the entirety of the channel's value. And if you don't make more than 4 tx with the channel, your overall fees will have been more (on a sat per kb ratio).
Not to mention lightning will only be economical in a hub and spoke model, not a true decentralized model. (privacy implications again).
I love Bitcoin, but it does not have to be a currency to be useful. It can be a store of value only.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:15:52
The higher the price goes, the more things where the fee to spend is more than the product itself.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:11:43
And then eventually the dust limit becomes a problem.

Sounds infeasible with 2.4MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:54
I've heard that miners could collude to steal funds if they all decided to stop verifying witness data, because the signatures are no longer in the block, so it's not enforced.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:57:12
Ha, as if we would be able to get consensus to make more hard forks. I honestly believe we have the ability to make 1-2 more hard forks tops. The more users of the network, the harder it will be to please everybody, and if decentralizers had their way we would have even worse a time getting consensus, at least with pools it's only a handful of people that need to be convinced. The only good solution is a small increase in maxblocksize every block, that way it is predictable for the rest of eternity.
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:14:46
A broken clock is right twice a day.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:18:16
@_date: 2015-12-17 13:57:36
In that picture the horse is blockchain technology. Bitcoin can barely get consensus on 7 tps, compared to VISA alone doing in the thousands.
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:48:18
Like kind exchanges merely defer taxes, you still have to pay. Luckily with Bitcoin it's super possible to realize losses in USD, but gains in BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:51:09

Granted it is a co-location gig, but the hardware is mine. But I can't stop somebody from potentially tampering with it. Not that running it at your home would be *much* higher security. If somebody wanted to tamper with your hardware, they would find a way.


That's basically saying we should be able to run a full node on a phone? Because there are no outliers, everybody must be able to have a full node.
Are you really saying it would cost 30k for you to run a node if the blocksize was bigger than 1mb? I honestly don't think that Bitcoin's future should be held back just so that you personally can run a full node.
@_date: 2015-12-04 21:09:53
The same reason that Bitcoin is the main cryptocurrency. The network effect. Banks already have their customers, Bitcoin is the one that has to disrupt. If you honestly can't see that, then I recommend you lay off the hopeium.

Unfortunately China has a significant investment in Bitcoin and mining.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:28:01
You realize the time is because the current code verifies each block no matter how old it is, right? The time it takes tk download the chain is nothing compared to the verification time. If it only verified the last couple thousand it would be much faster.

If they are so new, how do you know they even have any customers funds to short with?
So what if they use this test to manipulate the market, if a company can spend 4 grand to potentially make millions simply because the community is split on blocksize, I'm just sorry I didn't think of it first.
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:41:38
Credit isn't bad. It's people who spend more than they will be able to repay that are bad.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:30:10
Your purchase would get more expensive because the seller is gonna wait for confirmations, but the price is going up, but you already broadcast your transaction.

Simple as that.

@_date: 2015-06-16 06:36:26
Now that's what I call irony. But yeah, banks have the most potential to gain from BTC. And it would cause great upward pressure on the price. Even if banks used colored coins, they would still need many to pay the tx fees.

@_date: 2015-06-17 00:25:47
Unlimited block sizes isn't bad. Nor can they happen. If the blocks become too large for the network, miners will have to limit their size to keep the network and their bitcoin income flowing.

The Bitcoin market used to be just Satoshi.
But in reality, any colored coin implementation will probably be backed by a corporation or something. In the case of the stock example, probably backed, and bootstrapped by the NYSE or some other stock exchange company.

Where do you live that it costs that much.
I pay 40$ a month (in BTC) for a 1 gbit line with 10tb bandwidth. My own hardware though, but adding a 1tb of storage a year isn't gonna cost me much.
My home gets 20Mbit upload (from Comcast no less), so I can feasible still host a full node with up to 10mb blocks (constantly full). If I so chose too.
Just because it is obscenely expensive for you, does not mean it is for everybody else. You are in this case most certainly an outlier.

Are you trying to run your full node on a ssd raid 10 configuration? How would 20mb blocks bring you up to 30k in what time period? It's 20mb per 10 minutes, which means if you can sustain 9 KB/s you will not fall behind. You can tether your phone for that kind of net.
It's a max of 1 tb per year in growth, I don't know where you're getting this 30k number from.
As for not running a full node, I do not see a reason for having a copy of the blockchain in my posession. I use web wallets.
@_date: 2015-06-04 00:17:39
I agree with this sentiment. Consumers are not the ones that need or even should be running full nodes. Consumers should run SPV nodes.

Assigning value to specific satoshis (in reality, it's a special way of crafting txouts). There are a few competing protocols for doing it.
Basically, it is possible to say that such and such Bitcoin in such and such txout is actually 100M units of something else. Or something another. One possible use is to use it to replace stock shares. A single Bitcoin can represent 100M common shares of a company.

Get off your high horses preaching about "social contracts".

Miners can still bloat blocks with this proposal though. But I think this is better than adding extra information to blocks, it is much simpler to implement and leads less options to mess up.
Transactions don't have to be "real", a miner can do transactions that shuffle their coins around and include them with no fee because they are the ones who mined the block.
I think that 2x is the way to go instead of 3x, because it will limit the growth better. And once we leave single digits, 3x would be a huge potential growth for a malicious miner to exploit.

@_date: 2014-03-13 20:11:06
It comes down to convenience, it's easier to keep the money in an exchange than wait for the concrete block times to pass, especially if you want to capitalize on a swing. Even so, as long as the deposits and withdrawls more or less equalize there is no real need to keep more in the hot wallet.
Users' balances could rotate on the exchange over a period of a week where everybody withdraws and deposits periodically, but not all at once, and the exchange could still keep most of it in the cold wallet.

The part where having a longterm understanding of the success of the *technology* doesn't mean you should buy Bitcoin, because the technology is the protocol, which exists in many alternate coins.

But, the exchange and all the alts I had been holding and trading in and out of have since gone down hill, so my 1% a day would have turned into like -3-4% shortly thereafter (due to my philosophy of not selling for a loss, I'd still be holding the alts).

@_date: 2014-03-05 16:37:12
As somebody else pointed out, if you only broadcast it to mining nodes, you shouldn't have to worry about the merchant hearing about it, because mining nodes actually have a negative incentive to forward a tx.
And then when the merchant tries to forward the tx that pays them, the miners will view IT as the doublespend and ignore it, even in the system I am describing, as long as it has a smaller fee, it would still be a double spend, which is why you should wait for a block to confirm a tx before acting on it.
Being able to override an unconfirmed transaction has benefits, such as being able to rectify an incorrect destination address, helping the miners by having a higher fee than the original transaction.

I don't think you understand how a deflationary model works.
There's really only two ways to work with a BTC wage:
1. You get an amount of BTC which is pegged against some other value, I'll use USD as the example, but really it could be any sort of "price index". Your wage is 65000 USD per year, you get paid biweekly (52/2 = 26) you get paid 26 times a year, and your payment is 2500 (65000/26) each time. So you get paid 2500 USD worth of BTC. If one BTC was 1250 USD at the time, you'd get exactly 2 BTC. Flash forward two weeks, and BTC is now 2000 USD each, you get 1.25 BTC for the next paycheck.
2. You just get a set percentage of the companies income (and if the buying power of BTC goes up, then this will be a smaller BTC amount each time, but it will represent roughly the same buying power).
My point is, you're getting the same amount of "value" each time, you're just getting less of the units of currency. 
EDIT2: If the employee doesn't understand this, then why would they even want to get paid in BTC instead of USD (or loaves of bread).
EDIT: Hell, instead of USD, just imagine I had said the price index was loaves of bread.

A small exchange lost upwards of 2k because they accidentally reset their AWS instance.
Like 1k or so were burned for counterparty.
I don't feel like parsing the blockchain to see some real numbers on the amount of bitcoins that have never moved (yeah yeah I know it doesn't for sure mean they can't be accessed, but eh). But I'm guessing that it's upwards of 5-6 million.

Since the sharechain is based on how many blocks you have mined, as long as your reorganized chain is the one being used, without doing any math, I'd expect the number of shares you have relative to everybody else to remain the same or go up.

That's how cryptocurrencies work, you only own the coins that you control. If you put 3 btc on an exvhange, you own 3 less btc, but you now also have a promise (that may or may not be fuffilled) that 3 btc will be sent to an address you specify.

The protocol merely defines a set of standards that pertain to the blockchain itself, the actual communication of transactions isn't set in stone, so long as they are valid transactions.

Well, I guess it depends what you are viewing profit relative to.
If he sold 1 BTC, he had 1000 USD, then if be only bought 1 BTC at 550$, he has 450 USD and 1 BTC. So he'd be neutral in BTC, but at a profit of 450 USD. If he went all in with USD at 550, he'd have 1.81 BTC, so he'd be  up in BTC by .81 BTC and 0 with USD.

You have to figure, not only are you downloading the blockchain, but you're also re transmitting it to all of your peers. So default is 16x (8 peers, each transaction, and the block containing them all again) the size of each block. At 500kb per block, and 144 blocks per day, you're gonna get about ~30 GB per month, but that's for only 8 peers, a good full node should have more than 8 connection, dozens even.
EDIT: I completely forgot about when you help new nodes build their blockchain. Those extra gigs come from when you send huge chunks of the blockchain to new nodes.

Depending on the verification level, you are reading once for every transaction that you get. On it's own, it isn't going to do much to the lifetime of your storage device, but it does shorten it by a non trivial amount, as with everything else you do on your computer. Except the other things you're doing of your own accord and not just donating to a distributed network.

Just associate an address with the account, and sign a server generated challenge when making the account. Server can both verify the knowledge of the private key for the address, and monitor when the balance falls below the threshold.
Or if you must keep their balance in a 2 of 3 address. Use time lock transactions, and you move the bitcoins every 24 hours(to invalidate, and then reissue the "refund" tx) so that in case the site goes offline, all the bitcoins will already have transactions floating that can return them to their rightful owners.
I'll write the code for you for 2 BTC.

Not with 100% certainty. Even still, making a bunch of small transactions to give it to multiple pools is better than completely destroying them.
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:37:37
Np, of course since I'm only like a 9/10ths node, I rely on additional blocks being mined before I deem a transaction confirmed, as my node does not posses the capabilities to verify a tx sent to me that my node didn't send itself (It uses inputs that I do not have saved).

SHA256d is useless outside of cryptocurrencies that use it. They can't even be used to crack password hashes, since nobody uses SHA256(SHA256(password)) as their hash. It's always some form of SHA256(SHA256(password)+salt).
If the ASICs were purely SHA256 devices they would be useful for other things, but AFAIK all the block header stuff is all hardware.

@_date: 2014-04-03 22:54:36
I assume you are asking how transactions work.
Bitcoin works on a model which saves transaction outputs instead of account balances. 
I assume this is the tx in question [f8cdbf...]( we can see ten inputs, which mean ten outputs are being used to fund this tx, there are three outputs from it, the biggest being 35. The 9.xxx BTC output was added to the nine other outputs and then split into three outputs.
Bitcoins are fungible which is to say that each satoshi is equal to every other satoshi (*in the eyes of the blockchain; barring colored coins, etc).
So to answer your question, the nine BTC have been sent to three new addresses. If you intended to keep following the money, I'd follow the two bigger outputs. As the last one has a USD value of only 11$, and since it was the last output, is most likely the "change" portion of the address (if not both of them).

There's nothing wrong with an anonymous exchange.
When it comes down to it, the only benefit you get is that you actually have somebody that you can follow to the ends of the Earth, there is no guarantee you'll get your money back. Just look at Gox, we know full well the name of everybody running that show, and it looks like it's users are only gonna get 1/4 of their balance back.
Anonymity on the other hand can also protect the exchange owner from offline influences.
Just because they are anonymous does not mean they will run off with your coin.
@_date: 2014-07-30 11:46:53

Banks can absorb the fees because they make money in other places, much the same way that Youtube in isolation is probably the most costly thing Google has. But the ad revenue and data mining they can do with it outweighs the shear bandwidth/storage costs.

Banks are a privilege, not a right.
You don't need credit cards to live. If you don't want somebody asking questions about the money you deposit into their care, don't give them money.
Every time I see a post where somebody was asked questions about their money they put into their bank account, I can't help but feel they are overly entitled. Unlike "Bank of Mattress", real banks have to report stuff to the government that commissions the production of the trade facilitator (cash) they control and watch over. Especially FDIC insured banks, which the government protects up to a certain amount of your money, they have to know for FRAUD PROTECTION purposes among other things.

Technically the filler data could not be hashed, and so long as the block itself was the right size that would work.
But I don't see the point in forcing miners to include transactions, that goes against the freedoms. Unconfirmed transactions with a fee will be less of an issue at the next reward halving.

I'm not saying Bitcoin will be completely replaced, but that expecting a future where there is only one cryptocoin being used exclusively is very short sighted.

If you know the person IRL, just give them 4 100$ bills.
That's really the easiest way.
If you both have Chase accounts, use Chase quickpay.
If you have a checking account and they have a branch of your bank in their area, write them a check.
Those all have zero fees, and the check and quickpay ways only take 1-2 days to clear, unless you have to mail them the check. Then the fee is 1 stamp.
If you're going back to fiat, Bitcoin probably isn't the best intermediary atm.

Using Bitcoinwisdom...
Bitstamp has enough for 2.5m, and that's with a high price of 673$
Average at my time of calculating was 662.44$, slippage of 1.92%
BTC-e has enough for 1.4m high: 660$, average 650.454 =  2.11%
Bitfinix has a much larger available order book, so I limited it to 3m and got an average of 672 which is 3.87% for that one.
If you buy on a single exchange, of course your slippage will be greater.
Edit: So for about 6m, your total slippage, if you buy with the numbers I used on each exchange it would have been 3.3%.

You still need to have them available to check, it's true that you would be able to "discard" the blockchain up until the release of this protocol, but after that you'd still have to be saving those transactions even as a lightweight node, unless you wanted to rely on other full nodes.

Bitcoin is open source. They could easily create an altcoin where each bank is given a set amount of the currency to transact with, reduce the mining reward to zero, and then just have each bank run a node, with such a small community of "miners" any attempts to defraud the other members would be easily discovered.
This may actually be something they do, because of how simple and beneficial it would be to them.
EDIT: Since this would be replacing the ACH, they wouldn't have to have the amount of currency equal to their actual deposits, so long as the average movement between the banks was roughly equal, which it should be, what they would probably see is a proportional distribution relative to the actual "market share" of each bank. And if all else fails the banks could easily give units to the other banks when they need it, as they aren't using it as a currency, but as a way of settling balances between them. Each unit of currency could even mean different amounts when sent to different addresses. The possibilities of a cryptocurrency being used in such a small community really opens up a lot of doors that can't be opened when the community is as large as Bitcoin's.
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:19:39
Well, if there are only 100TB (300TB, but 3x redundency) available to be used, and there is demand for 200TB of storage, then suddenly the value of each coin will have to double. Or more storage will have to be added.
I can tell you right now, I haven't tried to trade altcoins in months, but this coin will probably bring out the sleeping beast in me.
EDIT: Maybe even if the app allows you to set your own price, or just default to the network's suggested price.

Most business that "accept" Bitcoin don't even have to worry since they use Bitpay or some other payment processor, they don't even touch Bitcoins.
If the business just paid the Bitcoins directly to their employees, by my understanding that would not require them to pay additional taxes on it, and the employee would get it taxed as their income. Basically, if it's treated as a currency it will be taxed once, but if you treat it as an investment it's gonna get taxed a few times.

All the IO operations it does. Every time it receives a transaction it has to check to confirm it, and every time it receives a block, it has to once again check each transaction.
Not to mention every time the node is started it goes through this process for the last thousand or so blocks.

The only reason Bitcoin exists at all is because people are willing to use their computers to further the blockchain. Sure there are people who do it because they believe in the technology, but the vast majority are in it for the money. And it's that vast majority that have been steadily increasing the network hashrate (and the cost of attacking the network through mining related attacks). So don't be so quick to bash profit driven actors.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:55:00
Volume, market depth, speed.
All the important things to traders who actually make their livings off the tiny price movements.
A decentralized exchange is at its core limited by the bandwidth of the peer network. Imagine if Bitstamp, or MtGox at it's height was boiled down to a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:29:09
Given your public key, you can sign something, and the network can verify you know the private key to that public key.
But the network has no concept of "ownership" of a private key. If you know the private key, you control the bitcoins that have been made redeemable by that key. It's a very important concept to understand, nobody owns any Bitcoins, they merely know the keys required to spend them.
And anybody who knows the keys can also spend them.

As cool as this is, I can see a malicious actor putting up their own broadcast around a target area, ramping up the power and feeding fake data to target devices.
EDIT: Even disrupting a device for one block is enough to fork it from the network. Because I assume that each block will only be sent once by this broadcast, so if you don't pick it up on the first run, your blockchain will never be in sync until it is manually fixed.

It is possible that such a standard could be created, it'd be replace by fee, where you send a second tx using any or all of the inputs in the tx, but with a bigger fee. Miners would accept the higher fee tx and not the lower fee one.

You seem to have misunderstood my post, I am saying that the current system where you give your money to a bank to hold for you is *not* a bad thing. 
With the reasoning that Bitcoin gives you complete responsibility over your money, and there is no safety net if you should fail.
With banks there are a lot of checks to stop you from doing stupid things/losing it all, and fraud protection, etc.

I'm not even arguing that volatility is decreasing, of course it is, as the market cap goes up, it's harder to move the price, that is common sense.

Replace by fee is this idea that completely and permanently breaks zero confirmation security. It would allow for a transaction that spends the same inputs as one that is already in the network (a double spend essentially) so long as the fee is higher, miners would include the higher fee one because it is more profit. But this also means that transactions would officially be considered unsafe until they are confirmed.
Currently the network has rules in place where they don't aren't supposed to relay any type of doublespend.

From a security standpoint, yes, once you sign a tx, the public key is known, and advances in quantum computing may make it easier to derive the private key.
That's why it is recommended to never use an address twice. Once the coins are spent from an address, that address is magnitudes less secure from quantum computing.

Technically they are correct.

I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with asking people to declare how much physical untraceable money they are taking with them when they leave or enter your country. Especially when it is your property, that you printed off.
Imagine if a 78 year old woman was caught hiding almost 10 diamond rings on her person as she was leaving a jeweler's shop. It's almost the same idea, except with rings instead of money.

Your argument is that they don't have a big enough mining community, comparing them to a coin which is over five years old, when they are less than 3 (LTC being the oldest).
While it's true this is possible, it is a natural side effect of mining technology already being established at their conception. Bitcoin didn't have this problem because it was the first of it's kind.
There are some altcoins which have real potential to become as big as Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-06 17:38:48
I don't think you should view it as propagating double spends, but rather, if two transactions have the same inputs but different outputs, the one with the higher fee should be propagated, because that is the one that can be most expected to be included in a block.
But yes, in a nutshell, double spends should be propagated, either to break trust in 0 conf, or to warn the network.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:30:19
Actually, if your recipient wanted fiat, it would probably cost more once you add all the fees up...
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:54:47
Oh wow, you're right. So mining nodes have no incentive to forward tx, so a merchant shouldn't even rely on being connected to them to detect a doublespend.
If the doublespender sends the bad tx to the miners first, there is no guarantee they will relay it. Then he sends a tx to the merchant, who relays it thinking there is no doublespend occurring.

The block reward is the block subsidy(currently 25 btc) plus transaction fees.
The subsidy is not an amount that should be used when thinking about costs per transaction. The "true" cost per transaction would be the electricity cost associated with generating the block, divided by the number of transactions in that block.

@_date: 2014-06-13 01:04:11
I don't really get how this solves anything, if you don't return the work in a fast enough time (probably quick enough that this attack will do nothing) it will put that particular work back into the queue, and somebody else will get it and return the block...
At most all you're doing is wasting your own hashing power. And pools will just shift to a thing where you only get paid if a block is found during a round that you helped on. And nobody will argue because everybody will know that malicious actors are out there causing them not to get payouts.
Good work, you just hostilized the mining community even more.
EDIT: This attack can also be used against P2Pool, both through nodes, and directly as a node. Where you simply discard your winning block and pick back up on the chain when the next shareblock is produced by somebody else.

Because having 51% of the power instantly means they will execute a double spend.
And on that matter, you don't actually need 51% to pull the attack off, just to pull it off reliably.

Interesting write up.
Just remember that a block witholding attack against a pool can also be used to execute a double spend attack using your own pool.
EDIT: Who is to say that a pool operator couldn't divert some of their hashing power into another pool, and fool the entire network into thinking they aren't actually comprised of such a large portion of the network?
If they wanted to, at that point they could easily pull (and ever redirect their stealth hashing power back to their own pool and pull off any neferious attack they wanted to).

The price tanked because people got emotional, there was no technical reasoning behind the price tank, it was pure emotion.

At the point where I am using this card, there are no privacy advantages over using a credit card, this card is completely useless in any regard, you might as well just sell your Bitcoins on Coinbase and use them to pay off your credit cards.

They can put a doublespend in the blockchain as long as a conflicting tx hasn't already been put in the blockchain.

Even if they didn't use a scheme where sending to different addresses gives the coins different values, being such a small and specialized use of the blockchain, a central authority able to "create" units of the currency is completely acceptable.

Even if the price per Bitcoin were to shoot up, when the reward halves, miners are going to have issues, either they can lose 1/2(tx fees are nowhere near half the reward) their income, or only 1/3(tx fees are near half the reward) their income over the course of a single block.
The price per bitcoin will respond better to only a 33% decrease in mining income than a 50% income reduction.

...I've edited the default node to only store tx that are directly related to my addresses (and coinbase tx, but that's because I deem them worthy of my harddrive space).

@_date: 2014-10-26 05:22:02
Moving BTC from holders to active users(somebody has to buy it) would probably increase the transaction rate, so that would be good for miners, even in the event of lower tx fees...
We probably don't have to worry about this until at least 2021 (2nd halving from now). But the closer we get to that halving, we will probably hear more(even more so than in the next 2 years) noise from the miners who wish to have a constant subsidy.

They would have to fake or block without causing alarm any way for those node operators to notice their blockchain differs from the "real" one (blockchain.info, any other public blockexplorer), the only way to do that would to keep the block time pretty on point, and at that point they would be better off just mining.
These types of attacks that rely on the actors wanting to damage Bitcoin more than gaining profit are all the same, and they are all equally destructive, but they are also very unlikely now. And they become harder and harder as the difficulty increases.

Inflation is bad if you want your money to naturally gain buying power on it's own.
But it's good if you want a stable value, even with a growing economy.
Deflation is good if you want your money to naturally gain more buying power as the economy grows because there is only so much of the unit of exchange to facilitate a dynamic amount of trade.
There's a reason we don't back the USD with gold anymore.

Since the amount of nodes would probably be less than 1000 (if even 100, how many major banks are there even?), and given the central authority they wouldn't really even need a "mining reward". They wouldn't even need a very large "hashrate", so long as they all in agreement on how the blocks are produced, and what the starting balances are. Their benefit is an almost instant settling of balances between eachother.

Actually, a bigger pool is more efficient. When GHash gets a block, all of it's miners immediately get to start mining for the next round, but other pools have to wait for the network propagation which can take a few seconds, and the network speed is on the order of Peta hashes per second, so that's petahashes being wasted every second until the other pools are notified of the new block.

How is it insecure? It could be a private blockchain not accessible or even usable by somebody outside of the network it is intended for. I'm not saying it's the best idea, but just that it is possible.
A blockchain in this context is a distributed record of history, nothing more, nothing less. Bitcoin uses it to keep track of transactions, but IBM could use it to keep track of serial numbers, user settings, or other things without the need for a central server.
EDIT: Damn right trolls like me would attack it for the lulz, I would have attacked Bitcoin for the lulz if I had heard about it back when I still had the capabilities to attack it. What's your point? Security can only be improved when people find and exploit faults.

Until a tx is signed, all you know is the hash of the public key. From the ECDSA you get the public and the private key, in order to prove that you own an address you have to sign a transaction that includes your public key, the public key can be used to prove that you know the private key if your signature was correct.

Except everytime we play, the amount you will give me is reduced. That is a more complete example.
With P2P you have a smaller and smaller chance to take a smaller share of the reward if the other miners in your pool are adding hashrate. With mining, the sooner you get the reward the better.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:28:04
Then there would be no argument, because people would deem 0 conf transactions unsafe and wait for block confirmations when dealing with onchain transactions, which isn't to say you have to wait for the next block.
Offchain transactions via payment processors acting like modern day credit/debit card companies are what save us from waiting for the next block.

Because of the nature of how Bitcoins are "stored" in the blockchain. When you send a tx, you send all the inputs that you use, if what you're sending is less than the total sum of the inputs you used, the remaining part gets sent to a new address you (usually) control as "change", to be used as an input in another transaction.

Is that really a bad thing? The price per coin shouldn't take a 10x hit, because we are already aware of the total amount. Obviously supply will increase, but it shouldn't be a factor of 10 drop in price.

That's true, I haven't tackled writing a coin management system, but I have given thought to how it would work: Only keeping portions of the blockchain directly relevant to the exchange itself, having a tiered distribution of output sizes for withdrawls (No actual cold/hot wallet design), a system to produce transactions which empty all user balances to their desired addresses at a moments notice in a worst case scenario.

@_date: 2015-05-11 10:56:18
That is a common misconception. As long as nobody controls more than 51% of the hashrate, reducing the block interval does not make it easier to reorganize the blockchain.
An attacker with 25% of the hashrate has a 1/8th(.25*.25) chance of reorganizing a chain 2 blocks deep, no matter what the block interval is.
There are small tidbits due to latency between nodes, but until you have 45-50% of the hashrate they are inconsequental.

Because even at just 1 tx per person per day, that's over 7 billion transactions per day. I don't think it's actually feasible to store that level of information in the fashion that Bitcoin does currently. Even if only 1% of tx were done by Bitcoin, that's 70 million tx per day. 
Do you really think the blockchain needs to be used a minimum of 70 million times per day? And needs to be saved permanently?

With no block size limit, we will likely see small blocks, miners have ever incentive to limit block size so that fees will go up.
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:53:38

@_date: 2014-12-12 12:26:50
To expand on that, you can think of the difference between the "true" cost (the electricty centered one) and the transaction fees per block, as the network deficit. Blockchain.info used to have a graph that showed this, but as it became more complex to accurately estimate the electricity cost of the network as a whole they removed it.
But when the next reward halving happens, the network deficit will play a role in shaping the market, the price per coin *and* the average transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:26:32
Yes but if all the miners agreed to mine small blocks, the average fee would have to go up. Even greedy miners would have to understand that if they colluded they would make more money.

I'm going by an assumption that these trades will take place on the current broker's sheets still. And probably not denominated in BTC. So each broker would only need to do on chain transactions when the investor wanted to go to another broker. Given that you can trade hundreds of times a second, putting everything on the chain will be impossible.
Everybody in r/bitcoin seems to hate the idea of offchain transactions, but they really are something that if done right are way better than putting everything on the chain.

That is an interesting idea. But I feel like something like Storj which *has* to be trustless, wouldn't be the ideal thing to use in such a scenario. Since you basically would own the hardware in the situation you outlined, I don't think certain portions such as the encryption and other "proof" parts of the Storj protocol would be required. And the overhead they induce would also be avoided by rolling a system specifically for what you said. And to the point of your OP, the overhead associated with "proving" CPU and RAM availability/usage would probably outweigh any gains if the system had to be trustless. But for an in house use to turn workstations into a server of sorts, it might still be possible and very useful.

I've never heard of such a gross waste of computing power. And electricity. It would be better to have these devices donate cpu to folding rather than maybe a few million hashes a second. By time the first gen hits the fab center they will already be 10-20% below initial expectations (as a function of relative hashing power) two weeks later another 10%. Bitcoin's network won't notice the loss of the devices when they finally stop. Mining should really only be done by large conglomerates. Who can actually make a noticeable difference in the network hashrate. The devices contributions could be brushed off as varience.

@_date: 2015-01-07 16:27:01
I don't think you understand what I was asking.
Miners can choose to try to remine blocks to change the blockchain, but they avoid doing so because that means they would lose out on potential profit from mining the current longest chain.
But Bitstamp could have paid them 1k Bitcoins to attempt to remine the blocks to move from their hot wallet before the initial hack happened.
Of course, they would have to pay them from a tx that hasn't moved since before the blocks they want to remine, so that there can be no shenanigans...
I guess this would only work for a large miner, or if several colluded.

And with Bitcoin you have value manipulation by whales, and malicious entities. Counterfeiting in the traditional sense is impossible with Bitcoin, but you can achieve a similar effect by hacking any service which has stores of Bitcoins.

I've never used Armory, but from google it looks like Armory still utilitizes the full blockchain, where Electrum offloads that to about 60 servers (one run by me), so there are obviously some privacy implications. You can ofcourse run your own server and exclusively connect to it.
Electrum uses deterministic key generation so recovery can be done from a seed (idk if Armory does this).

Technically you only need to guess a much smaller portion of them to have a 50% chance at any one address. Thanks to the birthday problem. And at that, you might as well dedicate all extra power to bruteforcing keys, because the reward is infinite and the risk is 0, and the cost is negligible.

This is already possible, and well within the protocol.
I'm just wondering if miners will create official channels for it to be done.
It isn't a dangerous precedent, given that you have to offer a miner at the *very* least ((block subsidy)x((blocks you want to remine) + 1))/(their share of the hashrate as a decimal) for it to even be profitable for them to do so. And even then it only has a (their share of the hashrate) chance of succeeding.
(Yes I am aware that they would actually have a slightly higher than their hashrate chance, because they are no longer "contributing" to the main chain, so the main chain's hashrate decreases accordingly)
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:33:19

Here's a few thoughts. Bitcoin is not for everyone. Computer security needs to be improved so that lil ol grandma doesn't wake up one morning to find her entire live savings gone. (Because if you hate banksters you will advocate against webwallets).
Not everyone is ready to "be their own bank". It's a lot of responsibility to be 100% in charge of your money with no recourse. In a time where people are still accidentally losing the "change" portion of their physical wallets.
You need to change the Bitcoin ecosystem to be more user friendly if you ever want to "defeat the banksters".

@_date: 2017-02-06 08:27:17
Why do you believe that nobodies need to run full archival nodes? As opposed to running an Electrum client, offloading the heavy lifting to operators like myself who can afford it?
I honestly don't understand the ideology behind it, if the userbase of Bitcoin expanded by a power of 10, even if we kept the blocksize the same, that's 10x as many transaction that require verification as they enter node mempools, 10x (realistically more) bandwidth usage.
It doesn't make sense to try and limit something to the lowest common denominator of a home PC and at the same time shoot for global levels of usage. Not when you're dealing with a permenant ledger and transaction network.
The node count will not decrease, businesses will have financial incentive to run their own node. Power users like myself will have incentives.
Idk. I'm a proponent of bigger blocks and offchain scalability, but both, not one or the other.

There's absolutely no way to prevent this.
The movement towards centralization is directly proportional to the profitability. Nothing can ever be ASIC proof, at a certain point when it becomes profitable enough to warrant the research into ASICs for a specific PoW algorithm, they will be made. No amount of memory heavy, CPU heavy, storage heavy, network heavy features will prevent a high market cap coin from being centralized. Centralization is simply just more marginally efficient because of block propagation.

The only "good" a fixed supply does is provide assured long term deflation and increase in price compared to inflationary currencies.
The bad that does is eventually cause the 8 decimal places to be insufficient to transact a minimum value.
Edit: causing either hardfork or offchain solutions to ve needed to expand the divisiblity.

It really depends how the 100k they owe themselves was accounted, if it was accounted in accounts on the exchange itself, then it'll be easier for them to get it.
Except with Bitcoin there's not really a way for the court to force you to give up control of your Bitcoins.

EDIT: But on that note, why are we trying to restrict resource usage if resources are getting cheaper every year?
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:15:14
When Lightning first came out, they said we'd need 100mb+ blocks to support any real level of adoption. Every user still needs to push a tx to get started. And if they ever wanted to redeem some of their Bitcoins they'd have to close their payment channel.
Lightning still requires onchain tx.

My my, how quickly we forget the past. There was originally a 32mb limit, but it was changed so that the blockchain would not get bogged before the network had a chance to bootstrap. I think it has bootstrapped enough.

@_date: 2016-06-14 21:50:00
They would only need to move BTC when they needed to get a different currency. I'm not aware of how Western Union works, but unless they are independent franchises. They can just keep a tally of all the balances of every currency they have outstanding, then when they need to, they can sell into a currency and move physical notes to the needed location. That's assuming they currently move money around with international transfers.
@_date: 2016-06-09 20:57:35
So you do do some verification of the blocks. From the FAQ I was given the impression you did none.
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:00:00
Talk about moore's law, with every block you'd have to go and calculate all the percentiles and see which block the last transaction was in, for every address (Bitcoin doesn't store balances currently, so it would require either A, keeping balances, or iterating all tx every time). That's going to add a huge amount of IO operations, not to mention unneeded complexity.

How do you peg to an exchange rate, in the protocol? 
The amount of tx data which a node must have readily available is *just* the utxo set(and block headers), which iirc is still under 2GB. We all knew what we signed up for when we decided to become full nodes. Even if blocks were 32mb (constantly full),  you're only looking at 1.6tb per year if you decided to keep the entire history, much less if you ran a pruned node. I just bought a 4tb drive for 100$ for my desktop. That'd be like 50$ a year. And it's only gonna go down.
Expiry dates in a deflationary currency make no sense.

That's like saying education is amazing, while discounting the fact that you live in a nation that has very good higher education, and ignoring all the nations that do not have access to such amenities.
Paper money and gold require no infrastructure to be used as payment for stuff. Even when a business loses power they could still accept cash or gold, not true with Bitcoin. Even if your cell phone still had power and internet, if the business did not, it could not be used.
Bitcoin is amazing, but we can't just ignore the obvious drawbacks. The McDonalds around my area are cash only every night at like 3 in the morning for a while as they restart their systems. That means no digital cash (credit/debit cards) and only paper money works as payment. If they accepted Bitcoin, it would also not be usable during that time.

@_date: 2017-01-20 06:15:28
My thoughts are basically... the government could enforce these rules since the blockchain is public. And your acceptance of Bitcoin would also be public.

You assume the only motive would be to steal the Bitcoins. To quote the Joker; some men just want to watch the world burn.

I could give you thousands of predictions that did not turn out. He got lucky
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:01:12
Probably something like 30-40% of coins are lost.

You pick it up and do a quick take to see if anybody saw you.
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:43:48
How is that possible though, 10 million exchanged hands tp pay for the loss.
@_date: 2017-01-29 23:27:05
Immediately. 
My thousand dollar hardware (cira 2007) and my 40 dollar monthly collocation fee. Are ready to handle 8mb full blocks. In addition to running a few other services for the community.

But how much of that CC fraud were you liable for?  I was liable for 100% of my bitcoins.

That's why you split it equally among exchanges to reduce risk.

Yes exactly! Nobody wants the rejecte at the end of the alphabet.
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:22:11
Reducing the amount of UTXOs primarily benefit mining nodes. Non mining nodes have 10 minutes to verify blocks in their entirety. Therefore they don't need to keep the UTXO set in RAM, at most a time based subset.

@_date: 2016-12-08 05:57:13
I mean, if 15m people each wanted a single Bitcoin... let alone all the lost, and people with more than one. 2k bitcoins taken out of circulation everyday is all it'd take to push the price up.
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:24:55
Bitcoin was a frowny face for a bit, then it was a slanty face, and now it's a happy face. This cycle has occurred quite a few times. So investment wise, buy now, sell in a little while then wait for the cycle to happen again.

Weird, I got .1btc the other day.

This is honesly the biggest circlejerk you've ever been a part of. Just wait till we go above the natural growth price, hit the new top, then drop to growth levels. It gets better.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:37:37
Actually, I'd say you fall outside of the lowest common denominator for hosting a full node.
In my eyes, those who earn with Bitcoin (businesses) should be able to subsidize a full node. Regular users who don't require the trustless property on a daily basis (how often do you actually spend or receive btc) don't need a fullnode.
You can bring up poor countries as much as you want, but when the fee market causes them to have to pay a lot of money just to (open or close lightning channels which require a full node) make a tx. The economics don't make sense for the current use case at these fees. If people can't afford a full node right now, they're already priced out of utilizing the main off chain scaling (in a trustless manner, but otherwise why are we even arguing about trustless if you're willing to forgo it for a certain use case).
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:47:49
Imagine the price pressure that would cause. Time to set up those sells.

@_date: 2017-01-29 13:42:14
Can somebody save and hash this in the blockchain for proof?
@_date: 2016-11-17 18:18:25
Yeah seqwit will increase capacity as long as people use it.
It's a pretty weak solution to the blocksize limit in my opinion. Even if we get lightning network deployed, we will still need to increase the blocksize eventually.

8k btc would be a much smaller percentage, based on dividing the bitcoins equally among the entire population of Earth.

Oh wow, I guess I severely overestimated my class. I also fall into the 1.04%, but this is sort of misleading as they are counting addresses, not owning entities. My coins are over at least 100 different addresses.

Centralized mining is more profitable due to latency.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:21:45
Allowing everyone to run a node is meaningless if they're priced out of using the network. Lightning requires a full node, and at least two tx.
@_date: 2016-12-03 16:03:17
Every data leak will make it that much easier to track. You think it's bad now when a password you use gets leaked? Wait until somebody you've done business with has part of their tx history leaked. You don't even have to be the primary victim for it to affect you greatly anymore.
Bitcoin is *not* anonymous.

Lol okay. I'm sure you believe that. Enjoy never using your btc for anything that can be tied to your identity  (no in person tx at any business, no mail purchases shipped to your house or anything in your name, no digital purchases associated with your name).
If the government can tie any of it to you, they can tax you on it. Of course taxes are "optional".
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:03:22
Timelocked transaction paying out to an address they control, you update it and create a new one every now and then.
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:55:41
Bitcoin can't even decide to raise the blocksize limit(which was originally intended to be a spam stopper to prevent the network from being attacked while it was still new, the real original limit being 32MB), and decides to build things on top of it that will just serve to fill the blocks even more.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:53:06
To be clear, by on off ramps I didn't just mean btc -&gt; usd, I mean merchants as well as the btc &lt;-&gt; usd exchanges.

Miners can do what they wish. They have the hashpower.
@_date: 2016-11-04 15:54:48
Explain what you mean by 51% attack.
The only real attack they could run would be not mining any tx. Meaning the fees to be gained by overcoming their hashrate would incentivize other miners.

I don't think you understand what volume means, especially on 0 fee exchanges.
If I sell you 100 btc, and you sell them to your mom, that's 200 in volume even though only 100 "individual" coins were involved.
@_date: 2016-11-05 20:35:57
This would be better if it was a real time graph, not plotted as their age, so we can see them growing and dying compared to bitcoin's prices instead of their age.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:47:51
Not yet to my knowledge, but it wouldn't be too hard to implement.
It wouldn't be free though, to invalidate the previous payout, you'd have to move the coins, incurring a tx fee. Unless I suppose you included a second timelock portion to pay out to yourself? But that would be risky if a malicious actor got ahold of the tx they could effectively burn the coins (after you passed ofc, when alive you could just spend them yourself).

The bitcoin community has a real problem accepting the current laws and system. You wouldn't expect a bank to relinquish funds that are under investigation, so why coinbase? No, it's not fair, but it's how the system works. Because as much as everyone wants to avoid it, bitcoin is amazing at enabling illicit activities.

Just because their success won't contribute directly to your finances doesn't mean the blockchain technology isn't what they need. Besides, we don't need all these extra things being pushed into the blockchain when the developers can't even achieve consensus to raise the block limit.
That very reason is probably why they developed it off the Bitcoin blockchain to begin with. The amount of volume they might end up adding would bring us well above the 1mb limit.

The value of Bitcoin won't drop because a single person decides to decrease their horde. Satoshi can't crash the market, because even if 1 million coins were dumped, the price would rebound eventually. Overall volume would increase on the exchanges, because of the coins that were just added to the hands of people who are actively on exchanges.

Most of them would be sold to people for pennies. I think the problem is that people are imaging his horde as supply being added to a rational market. But that supply can only be added via exchanges filled with irrationally greedy players. Dumping on all the exchanges at the same time would obviously bottom out the price... until they were all bought up. And then I believe we'd see the biggest price rise, because suddenly the uncertainty of those million coins would be gone.

You send your Bitcoins to an address you control, with unspendable till X enabled, and then craft a transaction using that output to their address, give them that transaction, but just before X, you repeat the process (by resending the coins to yourself, you invalidate the previous transaction you gave them), set it out a month or so, so when you die, they wait a month before the unspendable till X expires, and they can broadcast the transaction.
You can even do it in an automated fashion to email them the transaction every month.
EDIT: A month should be enough time for even small amounts to get enough priority to be sent without fees.

I'm sorry, but the very idea of this is insane, and an utter waste of electricity.
Even if they had a meaningful impact on the hashrate when they were introduced, 2-6 weeks after the generation is released, they would already be obsolete and contributing a negligible amount of hashrate.
Network security is important, but wasting electricity for the sake of "decentralization" (in which these ASICs won't even be contributing to the network anyways) is just plain ignorant.

It's competition to the price of Bitcoin.

It isn't necessary for them to mine profitably, but it is necessary for them to contribute a non negligible amount of hashrate.
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:38:20
You're right, the blockchain is too tall.
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:34:28


That makes very little sense, because no matter the hashrate, the same amount of BTC are mined every 10 minutes
And it's not really decentralizing the network. If 21 is actually able to pull this off, they will effectively push centralized miners out of the mining business. 21 is basically going to be deploying a mining network that runs "at a loss", but that they control.
I'd rather we have centralized miners that are directly dependent on their mines, than decentralized miners that do not rely on profitable mining, because they are less inclined to do what is right for the network, because the network's health mean's nothing to them financially, at least compared to miners who rely on being profitable.

I could handle a 50x increase in traffic on my node.
@_date: 2015-07-23 18:27:42
Yeah, but the problem with anything related to mining, is that mining is a race to the bottom.
As soon as it becomes profitable, people will immediately jump on until it is just marginally profitable again, no matter the price point.
That's the reason I just can't see something like this working, and the same reason I see mining as being centralized in the future.

I don't think this should be called an attack on the PoW protocol, it's no more an attack than the shift from GPU to ASICs was an attack.
Somebody found a way to calculate blockhashes faster, that's the natural evolution of mining. Sure, they're using their increased hashing power to block something that breaks their advantage, but that's not really an attack, it's just business.

Centralizing miners gives an efficiency bonus related to the hashrate and latency involved.

@_date: 2017-04-23 04:08:52
This adds unneeded complexity, for what gain? A user is not gonna decide to you your site if they aren't already just because you allow them to put money in, and get btc out (at a terrible exchange rate, this is why it wouldnt improve user onboarding, anyone who would do it knows how to get btc at a better rate and would likely be okay waitthe time to do so).
To reduce exposure to volatility, someone will have to lock up a margin of fiat to exchange for btc. Either the sitr or the processor will have to eat that opportunity cost.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:15:16
Wrong. It entirely depends on how much hashrate is added between now and then.

ASICBOOST itself is not bad. It's more that the miners using it don't want to activate segwit because it ruins their advantage.
But everyone is spinning it as an attack on Bitcoin to try to push segwit by forking asicboost into defunctness (ironic since most of the community lamanted ETH for forking during THE DAO hack).

As long as storage prices keep falling, and Bitcoin's growth is not too extreme( even given a larger blocksize) it should be possible to store the full blockchain on a single drive. Imagine newegg selling a blockchain drive that comes preimaged with the full blockchain in the most universal filesystem format.

Because pools smooth out your reward. You're not going to spend all the capital on mining equipment just to hope you find a block, when you can help a pool find a block and get reliable income per your hashrate.
Pools are really the only way more than some small number of entities can mine at high difficulty.

Of course Satoshi wouldn't, that would force them to give up their identity.
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:52:03
Yeah, it boosts tx fees proportionally to how much hash power is using the optimization. To a maximum amount dependent on the block reward compared to the tx fees. When the tx fees equal 30% more than the block subsidy, then it becomes economical to include fees instead of using the optimization. This problem will resolve itself in a little under 4 years.
@_date: 2017-04-14 03:33:26
How would it be not easy?
Force businesses to pay taxes in Bitcoin, then force them to explain where those coins came from, any unexplainable transactions would result in fines.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:23:28
I'm sorry, but you can't ignore reality (costs) when you look at this. We're talking about non negligible costs. Gone are the days when you could hope to earn with your GPU. In order to have a chance at any income  (sans pools) you'd have to control a non negligible percentage of the hashpower. The higher the difficulty goes, the more it costs to keep your percentage up. High difficulty is important for network security, we have to accept the consequences of higher network security.

Unfortunately there will always be costs associated with running a full node l,I'm just trying to point out that those costs are being greatly exaggerated.
It's true that I could not run this node at my home, but that is due to the lack of competition among ISPs, not because of Bitcoin being extremely resource intensive. Dedicating a single hard drive to the blockchain is probably the only solution in the long run, but that's the way it has to be if we want everything to be onchain and trustless.

Then a 51% attack happens...
@_date: 2017-04-12 03:50:22
How is it impossible?
The government might not be able to force citizens to abide, but they can force companies to abide.
If you force taxes to be paid in Bitcoin it becomes even easier, as you have a clear record of where the money is coming from, and you can force them to tell you what every tx in the chain leading up to the payment to the government means, and who paid for it.
You're honestly naive or stupid if you think governments can't utilize an immutable public ledger to track the flow of money among at the very least corporations.
EDIT: When I say force, for Russia it implies probable physical violence, for most other countries just jail time/fines.
@_date: 2017-04-19 04:09:40
It creates 20% more blocks with the same power. So if the power usage stayed the same, the network hashrate would grow by 20%. The work done(block candidates hashed) has gone up. Which increases the difficulty during the next adjustment which increases the network security.
 Just because you don't agree with the ideals behind the people using it doesn't make it less of an efficiency gain.
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:19:35

@_date: 2016-09-11 02:33:52
The only part of the blockchain that most people need is the UTXO set(1.5gb or so right now), and probably a few hundred full copies of blocks. Unfortunately there isn't a trustless way to obtain the utxo set, because it isn't recorded in every block. If perhaps the merkle root of the utxo set was included in the blockheader you could trustlessly obtain it from peers.
Otherwise you have to run through all 82gb of history.

The rate at which they can be validated can never be higher than the protocol limited rate at which they can be created.

I would consider miners to be a separate category from users. But still... I forgot the mining process required you to have *every* block (it doesn't), miners also only need the utxo set and the previous block in order to create a valid next block.
@_date: 2016-09-05 19:33:55
But it's quicker to reach a point where a reorganization is unlikely. In ethereum, a single block isn't secure, but you get a secure transaction much quicker than 10 minutes.

What an ambiguous statement... There are plenty of coins that do certain things "better than Bitcoin". Any privacy oriented coin will have better anonymous transactions than Bitcoin. Any quicker blocktime coin will have quicker to confirm transactions. Ethereum opened up an interesting platform of distributed "computing".
Other than the most mining power and being first, what does Bitcoin have that makes it worth the price people pay?
I'm not saying Bitcoin doesn't have it's place at the top *right now*. But there's no reason to assume it will always be king. Bitcoin's slowness to change will most likely be the eventual downfall of it.

I think it'd be trivial for an attacker who wanted to break segwit to get 5% of the hashpower. The more successful your withholding attack, the better your pool looks compared to others. Individual miners are profit driven, so they'd migrate to your pool.

I think to successfully execute a withholding attack you can have less than 50%.
Rewriting the blockchain is the holy grail of attacks, but there's ones that do relatively large amounts of economic problems with less hashpower.

That's because it verifies it in it's entirety as it downloads it.
It does not take the same amount of time to DL 40GB as it does to verify the blockchain. If you just download the blockchain and then start bitcoind it would be a lot faster.

Okay, you buy something from amazon for .54 btc. You now have a channel of state 0:0.54  (.54 for amazon, 0 for you).
Amazon does not need to "take" your payment immediately, so they do not close the channel (allowing them to spend the .54 btc).
Your friend  (whom has a channel open with you for 0.8:0.2) asks amazon for a refund, or something, anything really. Bottom line, Amazon is sending them money. (This example makes no sense since why not just use their existing channel, maybe it was closed already) Amazon routes .3 btc through you. To your friend.
States before routing:
Friend - 0.8:0.2
Amazon - 0:0.54
States after payment is routed:
Friend - 0.5:0.5
Amazon - 0.3:0.24
Does that make sense? Lightning needs open channels to route through. Even a full payment tx can be used to route with.
Edit: my example implies no fee for routing.
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:17:59
The way I thought it was going to work was, all tx become channel tx, they would start off as 0:1 channels, then if the person you sent to decided to route something through you, it would become a x:(1-x) channel, etc. They could choose to close immediately and take your payment or keep open and route through you.
Or .9:.1 channels for subscription based things. The point being that many channels are opened initally, then they become utilized afterwards.

All of them. It's usually not even a problem with the wallet/service itself, but fault on the users' end.

Hardly, I see a world where banks use Bitcoin to settle between themselves. I honestly can't see people "being their own bank" at least not this current generation. Bitcoin requires a very high level of responsibility and technical knowledge to use correctly and safely.

Well that's the part about not immediately closing the channel, you pay someone, you now have a channel until they close it with no changes on your end.
Between you and your friends, so long as the recipient doesn't immediately close the channel, and "repayment" would be off chain and instant. 
In reality though, Amazon will have many many channels open, so opening a channel with them does make sense, they will likely have a 1 or 3 hop route(amazon &gt;person &gt; business) many other businesses, simply because of the volume of their business.
It makes more sense the longer you hold off closing channels.

@_date: 2016-10-05 19:49:54
Because it would be cryptographically provable, you have the previous utxo set state from the previous block, all transactions, and a new utxo set state in the new block. Trivial to confirm the changes? You'd have to trust the initial utxo set state that you start at is valid ofc. But this is a better way to avoid downloading the entire blockchain to confirm it.
EDIT: If we went with the "checkpoint" system where we pushed the utxo set, that would be the furthest back you'd have to download.

Everytime somebody says useful features will be merged with Bitcoin... we've been trying to implement a scaling fix for almost four years. Now an Altcoin that is pretty much just a few magic numbers away from Bitcoin (meaning it is easy to swap in every well written Bitcoin app) implemented the fix in under 6 months.
Sidechains are the only solution to that, and at this rate Trump's second term will be done before we get anything changed in Bitcoins codebase.

People seem to be under the impression that a global distributed ledger that keeps every transaction, and is used by hundreds of thousands of people daily should be able to run on a home computer. And that's just naive.

I suppose you'd rather everyone posted every day about every little grievance? Blaming everyone else for everything, especially when they put themselves in a position where they could overdraft.
You are complaining about overdrafting, but then saying anybody who keeps a buffer in their account so that doesn't happen  (debit card gets stolen, business uses a foreign card processor, etc) is dumb. Get off your horse and take some personal responsibility for your actions, you put yourself in a situation where another charge to your account would result in overdraft/nsf, and paid the price.

Technically it follows a poisson distribution, but we would probably expect the next block to be 18 minutes away, or more, or less.
There have been instances of hours without blocks, and hours with many many more than 6 blocks. But on average the network operates at about 1 every 9 or 10 minutes depending on hashpower growth.
Edit: I could be wrong, but I believe the code will queue blocks to verify.

That 8mbps is only for receiving, consider that a node wants a ninimum of 8 connections, you actually get 8*8mbps, because either you forward the tx to another node, or all your peers send you it because they think you don't have it.

Base size is the block size in bytes with the original transaction serialization without any witness-related data, as seen by a non-upgraded node.
Total size is the block size in bytes with transactions serialized as described in BIP144, including base data and witness data.
The new rule is block weight ≤ 4,000,000.
A 1MB block of normal transactions would have a base size*3 of 3M, wouldn't it? And Total Size would add another 1M of blockweight? Thus meaning 1M of normal tx equals 4M of blockweight?
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:43:20
It hasn't ever really been the hardware requirements though. I think most people don't see any reason, it's not an actual requirement to use Bitcoin. And there's no tangible reward. I run a full node because I run a Joinmarket maker bot so I actually profit slightly.

Lightning still needs bigger blocks though. A lightning tx is larger than a normal tx. Fees for onchain tx will not drop without a huge capacity increase. And remember that lightning locks up your bitcoins.
Gambling? You expect to win more than you put in right? 
Trading? You expect to gain right?
Buying coffee? How many coffees do you really want to prepay for?
Tranafering with friends? How often are you going back and forth?
Where lightning really makes sense is between big services that naturally have a lot of transfer, but unfortunately these are probably the ones who will take the longest to enact it.
Even with hub and spoke, how often are you going to be receiving bitcoins after spending them? Remember that these transactions require 24/7 blockchain monitoring and you probably wouldn't lock them up for a long period of time in any given instance.

7 sends, 1 recv = 8
The absolute minimum would be 7.8mbps, but your node wouldn't be contributing anything to the network if you only ever received and never sent to any peers.


It was my understanding that when a node received a new block or tx it would automatically forward it to all it's peers. Perhaps this has changed since I last messed around with bitcoin-core.

Well, I think I figured out the method he's using to pixelate them, using my own private key QR code, I've managed to get something that resembles the image in question (in the corners where it matters). So now all that's left is to run this php script a billion times until it gets the qr code. Using the current image, the "cell size" is 15 pixels, my test qr code has a "cell size" of 8 pixels. So it's about 2^4 possibilities for each of the obscured cells. If my math is right... It might be 4^2. Either way, it's not too bad for this sort of thing.

"Register your payment addresses with us or we will shut down your business and lock you up."
I don't think you understand how easy it would be for them to do this.
They don't even have to do it directly on the merchants themselves, the payment processors, because let's be honest, every merchant is not going to code their own Bitcoin system. They are going to pick an off the shelf one or choose a payment processor to handle all the details for them (coinbase, bitpay, circle, etc).
Or even banks "I'm sorry, but blockchain analysis shows that you did not vet the incoming coins, therefore this entire tx is considered dirty, we must seize all these coins. You will be getting a call from the BPB (Bitcoin Protection Bureau) to answer a few questions."
Bitcoin does not make you immune to an entity imposing their rules. Especially not when every transaction is clearly visible.
EDIT: For clarification, I absolutely love what Bitcoin can do for merchants and consumers, but to ignore how much easier regulation can be (if they truly wanted to) is just stupid. Bitcoin will always be *pseudo*anonymous.

How do you expect a currency to be used by everyone and still be runnable on consumer hardware? Even Satoshi forsaw this happening. There will always be enough people like yourself who want to run a full node even though they don't need to. Even with things like the lightning network, mass adoption stil brings a higher cost to run a full node. You can't have mass adoption with consumer grade hardware unless the majority of tx happen offchain (even more than just lightning, iirc they called for 130mb blocks).

If a trader refuses to trade on an exchange because of their "political" ideals, then that's their loss. I'd argue that most traders who are trading for profit do not care what the exchange is doing, as long as the fee structure is favorable and the exchange is reputable in terms of cashing out. For regular idealistic users Coinbase may have just become less favorable, but for traders who simply want to play the market, nothing has changed, except there are more currency pairs to try and profit from.

You'll need a fullnode, and an electrum server. There are I believe two main servers, jElectrum and electrum-server (the python version). If you're running a private electrum server you won't need as beefy a machine, but I'd urge you to run a public one. There's less than 50 public servers, so it's not very decentralized.
You can look at the github pages for instructions on how to install them.

One of my personal criticisms is that it only makes an effective tx capacity increase if you utilize the segwit tx format. And additionally, it was a very complex solution to a simple problem.

I don't see how PoW is any less vulnerable to "the rich getting richer".

If you don't run your own full node, you have to accept that there will be costs associated with it. You'd have to have lookups from separate nodes. There's nothing to prevent a node from giving you a list of all but a single transaction on your list of keys, you'd have to get the list from other sources to make sure that nobody is cheating you.
But that falls into the same problems as the current network with sybil attacks. If you don't run a full node you have to trust that not everybody is going to try to cheat you, or you have to run a full node.
What are the problems with Electrum? I run a node on my server because my laptop can't bear to run Bitcoin, I understand the privacy implications, but security and decentralization? The only problem I see with bundling Electrum with Core would be the increased space requirements. My server is currently at 86G for Bitcoin and 43G for Electrum(10k history).

@_date: 2017-05-14 00:38:48
The fact that you have to say effective means it isn't really a size increase. It's only double if every tx is segwit. 
Even with "2-4" mb blocks we'd be hardpressed to scale very much. Or even bring tx fees down from pricing out small transactions, if the fee is more than 3%, merchants should just stick with credit cards, and yes merchants are probably more susceptible to fees because they are more likely to have a bunch of small inputs they need to move.

Not if they collude.

Your formula obviously doesn't take into account media read/write speed, or verification speed. Both of which are important. What is the use of downloading the blockchain if you aren't storing it. And how can you ensure you have the correct chain if you do not verify it.

You give us the encrypted private key, but you don't give us the address it is to.

But if it's never been used before, we can't know if we've found your password, because it will still give us an address, but not yours.

As far as I can tell, segwit as proposed only discounts the witness data, it'd probably save maybe 20-50% in practice. But fees will continue to go up on a per byte basis. This sort of problem will be less pronounced going forward, but these current utxos are pretty much lost.

Password hashing is a very un asic able field, because apart from the fact that there are so many ways to hash a password (mind you this is algorithm independent ways, ie just how the method makes use of the salt, and everything, iterations of the function, etc etc). Then there are having to deal with the fact that you can use more than one algorithm at a time, hell, even in non predetermined ways (make the "hash chain" dependent on the outcome of each function.)
You'd basically have to build a software scriptable piece of hardware with all the different hash functions in the hardware. It would be probably the most beautiful piece of hardware ever created if you managed it.

I believe Primecoin is the best so far (RE: It's still pretty flawed, but they are the same flaws as with every other crypto coin), because it's PoW is not as completely useless as all the hash based PoWs. Even if XPM does not become a currency, it certainly has a niche market to continue being used even as other alts fail, because prime numbers are actually quite popular, the primecoin miner could replace prime 95 or other burnin software for CPU stress testing.
And because of the built in inflation. Which is why I believe that Bitcoin is destine to become an investment/store of value, because it is hard coded to be deflationary, the economy will continue growing while the supply of currency actually dwindles(lost coins, etc).

You have to look at asics as longterm investments. The BFL 5Gh seems to operate at 50 watts. That's 100MH/Joule, which is upwards of 50 times more efficient than GPU mining. Which means you'll still profit up to 50 times as much because you're paying a smaller electricity bill. Longterm: gpu mining will die due to being too inefficient compared to asic. If you buy an asic, odds are you will still have profit even if the difficulty shoots up. At 300M difficulty which would require 2+petahashes per second, the efficiency required to break even (.15 per kwh) at 100$ per coin is only ~22 Mh/joule, well below the efficiency of the bfl asic.

The market would adjust by the creation of payment processors...
Payment processors don't just solve transaction fees, but also add instant confirmation instead of waiting for a block to be absolutely sure you can't double spend.
0-confs are an issue because there are people who want to make it possible to redirect a transaction with the introduction of a higher fee, as a standard, and not just a byproduct of miners maximizing fees.
I actually can't see a world where Bitcoin is used as a currency, and there *aren't* payment processors.

The difficulty is adjusted every block, presumably it is possible that eventually due to the distribution of primes that we might not be able to get chains longer than a certain length, but then again due to the nature of how the origin number is chosen, it's also very likely that the nonce of each attempt would prevent the network from stalling.

The 7/8 fork fix is different from excluding an "attacker", the 7/8 fork was caused by a lack of forethought in the upgrading of the protocol. To actively decide to revoke the legitimacy of a miner's blocks would be... much different and more likely to reduce the trust of the network.

By eat up bitcoins, I mean make them unspendable, I understand the need for a fee, but if it works by sending coins to a public hash that is actually the hash of the data instead of a known private key pair, then it effectively has thrown those coins away, deflating the currency.

The mining arms race will quickly evolve into power efficiency. Those with the highest GHash/watt will become the favored ones. After all, once the block reward becomes smaller than the transaction fees, most solo miners will drop out, and the pools will also lose many of their miners.
Most people will move to litecoin after that.

To my knowledge, just P2Pool does. I had this weird idea to try and start a p2p pool with regional subpools, and 10% of the reward would be split to the other regions in the main pool. Regional pools would needed because p2p pools need low latency to work effectively.

We aren't even sure just what portion of bitcoins are still accessable, we only know which ones have been moved *on the blockchain* which isn't even to say the ones that have been on exchanges one transaction after they were mined.
And there's no telling which addresses represent any sort of drug trade or anything. We only have information after the fact that is publicized.
So any math will be flawed.

Bitcoin is pretty inefficient when it comes down to it, huge amounts of resources are being spent on calculating inputs which produce lower and lower SHA256d outputs (which have no use outside of SHA256d cryptocurrencies, how's that for energy multiuse?).

There's the problem, what is considered hostile? Would it be considered hostile if they still mined transactions, but they only mined their own blocks?

Well the IP is actually the first IP that relayed the transaction to them, but if somebody had access to a bunch of nodes, they could effectively with high accuracy determine the origin of transactions, and at the same time refuse to relay, thus weakening the network slightly (by taking up one of the 8 default connections on the qt wallet).

I personally believe that deflation is bad for a medium of exchange.
The blocksize limitations are actually quite an interesting thing, because on the one hand increasing it allows more transactions = more fees, but decreasing it forces people to use higher fees to get into it.

Well, the point is, that unless you work for that mixer service, you *shouldn't* know which addresses belong to them.
TDoie sends 200BTC to Address A.
Bob, Frank, Alice, Bernake, and Tim all send 75 BTC to Addresses B, C, D, E, and F respectively.
TDoie says to the mixer service that he wants 100 coins back. So the mixer service decides (it's a program, not a person) to send 50 coins each from B and E.
So if anybody looks at the transaction history, they will see that TDoie sent 200 coins to an address, then sometime later he received 100 coins from 2 addresses, the point is that the original coins can no longer be traced when he sells them, because the link was broken at the mixing service.
Of course, if you deposited all the coins, then withdrew them all, I'm sure common sense would allow somebody to realize you used a mixing service, but automated methods probably can't track you that way yet.
Hope that cleared it up.

I'm gonna get downvoted, but there is more backing the value of the USD than BTC.
An entity with a huge amount of real and physical power ("immoral" or otherwise, it is still power) backs the albeit ever decreasing value of the US Dollar.
The only thing backing Bitcoin is speculation right now, it's usefulness as a currency is nowhere near it's usefulness as an investment tool at this point. And I'd argue that until the volatility decreases, it will only be a speculative tool. No entity backs Bitcoin, and the only thing keeping Bitcoin from being replaced by any of the alt coins is the fact that a lot of power backed currency has been spent on the Bitcoin network, mainly in the form of mining equipment. Huge amounts have been invested in creating silicon that can perform SHA256d as efficiently as possible.

Lmao. The elitism coming from your post is simply amazing.
Litecoin offers a second kind of PoW, faster block times for quicker confirmations which is what irl transactions need.
Even if cryptocurrencies took over, it will always be plural, a single currency doesn't make sense. Hell, right now we have cash or credit, think of Bitcoin as 10 minute credit, and Litecoin as cash.
Having multiple cryptocurrencies is NOT a bad thing, it just means the eventual market cap (read: your worth) will be split among multiple coins, which is NOT a bad thing if you aren't in it strictly for the money.

Yes. Once we hit the blocksize limit, which I believe will be influeneced by internet speeds. Since blocks need to propagate across the network quickly. Miners will start prioritizing transactions with higher fees. Meaning cheaper tranactions will have to wait in a queue.
EDIT: This also maximizes their profits which will start to be directly related to transaction fees next time the reward halves.

Mining will still produce transaction fees, and by time we are using Bitcoin as a single world wide currency, imagine 10k+ on-chain transactions a day, those transactions will still have to pay transaction fees to be included in the chain.

Well, there are fundamental flaws in the current design, the most obvious one is blockchain size growth.
But the one that originally got me thinking that Bitcoin is designed to fail, is the fact that it uses 32 bit timestamps in the block headers. They are unsigned 32 bits, so they last longer than 2038(one of the overflows of unix timestamps), but they will still overflow in 2106, which is 34 years before (2140) bitcoin is *designed* to stop minting coins (I say designed because at the current rate, it will probably be like 2130 due to hashrate increasing during the 2016 block cycles. Why would Satoshi (group or indiv.) in all their intelligence of designing bitcoin overlook one of the most common bugs (overflow) in programming? I could understand if Bitcoin was a short term project, but by it's very nature it was designed to run for at least 130 years. It's minimum expiration date is after the overflow will occur. It just seems obvious that they left that in as a subtle reminder that Bitcoin is merely a stepping stone to something greater.

You generate an address for somebody to send their coins into your pool.
Then when they need to take them out, you send them coins that OTHER people sent into the pool. You keep track of who sent to which address(and their actual balances) so they don't get sent coins from the address they deposited into.
It really only works if there is always enough in the pool to cover what just got added by another person. IE. Somebody can't deposit then withdrawl more than half your total pool or else you can't fill their order without giving them their original coins back.

Interesting idea, but...
This is asking for a collision.
1 die will result in 6 possible addresses.
2 dice 36 addresses
3 dice 216 addresses
etc, 6^nDice , blockchain.info reports around 70k unique addresses used each day. If we go ahead and assume each one is a new address (that's how bitcoin is supposed to be used to preserve anonymity) you'd need to roll 7 dice to generate that many unique addresses. And that number is per day, so after one day using your method, your address space would be exhausted(it's actually about 4 days since 6^7 is ~280k). But that's meaningless, since keys can be produced exceedingly fast, upwards of 22MKey/s (based on numbers for the vanitygen program) on the same GPUs that miners currently use. It would take 10 dice to produce an address space that would take a GPU a single second to bruteforce. It would take 19 dice before it takes that same GPU almost a year to brute force (18 dice results in about 2 months). And that's for a single card setup. In reality you would probably want at least 22 dice to be used.
Just some friendly numbers :) It is an interesting idea to use real world methods of randomness. Just make sure your address space can't be easily bruteforced.
EDIT: Whoa, I didn't click the link for your image that shows your method, my numbers assume you do something with the rolls that means each permutation (order matters) produces a separate address.

@_date: 2013-06-11 17:53:46
I actually had 35 inputs, I just checked.
Confirmations simply mean that the transactions are included in a block and can't be changed without a LOT of effort on somebody's part. You can build off transactions that aren't included yet, the only limitation is that you *might* only be able to use transactions that are already in the miner's txpool, but don't quote me on that.
EDIT: And most people won't/shouldn't accept that a transaction is legitimate until it is included in a block. Zero confirmation transactions are risky, for the same reason that this works, if you build a transaction with a higher priority you *could* get your coins back instead of them going to their intended destination.

It's already impractical to download the blockchain on a mobile device.
It will eventually become impractical to download the blockchain from the genesis block, instead relying on nodes that respond to address queries to get your balance. I guesstimate after 30GB people will stop being full nodes unless they have a real interest in the entire blockchain, like myself who sees this as a very likely outcome. I think a cool .00001 btc a month would give you unlimited queries.

As long as you're making more money than you're spending to power the thing, you're profiting in the long run. People have to stop thinking of bitcoin as being a short term thing, although your hardware break even has to account for the reward halving in 2016, though by then transaction fees might soften the blow.

Because it takes the average time for the entire 2016 block cycle. If you look closely, it ALMOST reaches the 14 day estimate, which probably takes most of the 2016 cycle into account.
The other two estimates are from smaller windows (when the hash power was already high), as opposed to in the beginning of the 2016 cycle, the hash power was exactly (ish) matched to the difficulty.

Litecoin is just over 2 years old, if we compare the cost of attacking the Bitcoin network at 2 years, we'd probably come to similar conclusions. We're basically watching Bitcoin grow up at a slightly accelerated pace.
As Litecoin matures and it's market cap increases (which it will, it's pegged to Bitcoin's), the cost of attack will go up, probably faster than Bitcoin's did, not only due to the PoW algorithm, but also the fact that Litecoin isn't the first cryptocurrency, and people will already be willing to mine it.

That's not how supply chain works. When I buy a Big Mac, the store doesn't instantly order two more patties, a bun, a shot of BM sauce, etc ,etc.
In the time it takes for them to order their next batch, the price (notice how I said price, instead of exchange rate as people do with currencies) of bitcoins could halve, or it could double.
The point is that it's too volatile to pay dues up the supply chain.
And why does the fiat price of the transaction matter if Bitcoin itself is a currency? Even subconciously you view Bitcoin in terms of fiat, you don't even believe it's a currency yourself.

As the difficulty increases, the profit margin shrinks, and those who can not keep up will stop mining (dropping the difficulty).

You're misunderstanding, by time Bitcoin becomes a major currency, the shear volume of commerce done with it will *force* off chain transactions to become the norm. Credit cards of today are basically "off chain" fiat transactions.

You trick it by putting the large transaction in the first one, it's priority is going to be lower because it is larger.
But then you do the second transaction which takes the single output you just made and only uses 250 bytes I believe? So it's priority will be higher and therefore will be allowed to be free. Also you have to have a minimum of .01btc.
The larger transaction then gets put into the block aswell, because it is a prereq for the smaller transaction.
At least that's my belief of why it works. I haven't looked at the source code to make sure my theory checks out, but I can assure you it works, I did it to one of my addresses and turned like 30 outputs into a single output.
Edit: What's stopping people from doing it is that it's time consuming for transactions and I had to do it by hand using brainwallet and blockchain.info/pushtx. But if everybody did this, then miners would probably change their rules and disallow this kind of trickery.

without 51% of miners' participation
The truth of the matter is, that if 51% of the hashing power decided on a new set of rules, their chain would grow faster than the older ruled chain.

I'd argue that storing them and being in circulation to be mutually exclusive.
And that's nearly 2% of "active" bitcoins in this hypothesis that were being held on an exchange for the purpose of buying drugs and other illicit things.
Supposedly 6% of all transactions on the network were from Bitpay on Black Friday, let's triple that number to maybe account for all active bitcoins used in sales, 2/18 = 11% 
Is 11% of all active bitcoins a large amount?

Except we will always have pools. Thus centralization.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:44:04
But how can you tell who specifically mined a block in a pool?

Imagine all the jobs that will be lost thanks to Satoshi..... And the shear lack of jobs that will be created thanks to it. Bitcoin basically distributes an entire sector to the entire population but doesn't pay anybody except for miners which is barely a profitable venture.

ASICMiner only has like half of their "shares" sold. They keep a good portion of their mining revenue. On top of their hardware sales that is.

Primecoin searches for prime* number chains.
While I doubt it is a perfect solution, it is at the very least a better PoW than SHA256d.
I imagine that once Bitcoin becomes big, great minds will find a way to produce distributed problem solving networks for the PoW.

I'd argue it's better as an investment. There are altcoins that make better currencies imo.

What I mean is, when you view the page, a script starts that takes the addresses it produced, and your computer initiates requests to get the balance from blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-07-01 19:07:30
I would personally say that the rapid increase in the exchange rate of Bitcoin (and then the subsequent decrease) goes to show how volatile it still is.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:51

@_date: 2013-10-04 21:33:35
Would they? At the point at which a government decides it's economically viable for them to do so, wouldn't the amount of money "in" the blockchain kind of make it impossible to leave?

That goes completely against the anonymous nature of Bitcoin.

I only turn my node on every few days for a few hours to update my copy of the blockchain.

I could argue that Bitcoin is a gamble. 
Stop talking like we are all investment bankers who care about percentages, I only care about the nunerical amount of profir/loss. So yeah, it does matter.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:21:27
The benefits of Bitcoin?
When Bitcoin finally becomes mainstream, it's value in USD will be so high, that any consumer purchase would be a mBTC or less, meaning the transaction fees will yet again be a large part of the cost.
And guess what? That means payment processors(AKA, credit cards) will become a thing again, which means giving control of your Bitcoins to somebody else so that transaction fees are less of an issue. Meaning that they will get hacked and stolen just like we see today with bitcoin sites all the time.
tl;dr: Offchain transactions will be the same as having a credit card that can be stolen.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:42:34
What ever is more profitable will occur.
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:43:19
But the hardware is useless without the software to use it.
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm trying to say, the economy and the network are symbiotic, and both required, one can't exist without the other.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:44:40
Look at the coinbase for the blocks in that list, most of them don't include the mined by ASICMiner that friedcat said would be made by their solomine.
@_date: 2013-06-16 15:06:47
Except there are very few companies with the capital to front the cost, and are willing to take risks with that money.

They have a little over 1% in a single address, yes.
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:34:17
Yeah, it is my opinion, but it makes more sense to me than the idea that some things are known throughout the universe as "evil".

The ingredients don't justify the higher price..
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:40:20
I thought that the limit was removed?
And regardless of the *current* limit, 1MB is maybe 5.2k transactions if each one was 200 bytes.
That's 8 transactions a second(if a block was generated every 10 minutes exactly, and all the transactions could be included in the very next block), my town probably has more than that. The limit would have to be raised.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:49:06
Well I mean if you do that, then it'd be fin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:21:59

Oh, then I guess the second transaction is actually not needed and does nothing. My bad.

Without miners there are no blocks.
If the community sees that the mining algorithm can change every time some joe thinks that mining has gotten too centralized, where is the incentive to invest in creating more efficient miners?
There goes the network security.

When ASICs come out, the electricity cost will be much lower so they can survive on lower transaction fees.
If you bought an ASIC, you're going to keep it running as long as it pays for its own electricity since it can't do anything else.

I think alt coins are easier to predict.
@_date: 2013-05-01 00:21:59
Each GPU gets like 1GH/s max and the ones that get that high a hash rate are very expensive.
And that is at very bad power efficiencies compared to ASIC, which have more GH/s at lower GH/watt costs.
Unless you're getting free electricity, or you live in an area where your mining rig can replace your space heater, GPU mining is quickly going to lose it's already thin profit margin.

Except not all of us object to them.
It's their ecosystem, they can do with it as they please. Who are we to regulate them into doing something against their will simply because it will benefit us?
What gives us the right to force our ideology onto them? Isn't that why we are in Bitcoin? Because we don't want to be forced into things?

Google could bump the hashrate really high then stop mining and screw the network.

So they're spending tens of millions of dollars to develop a technology that reduces the milliwatts per GH by maybe 10-15 milliwatts?
Bitcoin and ASICs are a joke.
They're spending money to make more money, which is what everybody is doing.

Even 400TH/s would still net you a profit at 120$ a bitcoin.

Well, if I could buy 50% less of a house, then that would make sense. But since 50% less of a house is actually not a whole house, it does make a difference.
50% more spending power is a difference. Things aren't priced in percentages.

Are you saying that the people who were able to mine on their CPU have not been rewarded more than the people who are throwing their money into ASIC scam after scam?
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:59:48
Until you take a leap of faith and actually put down the capital to start mining, your, and my opinion of their rationale for joining larger pools are pretty invalid.
If you want to decentralize mining power, then you can start mining and even it out. Or you can start mining and join the biggest pool.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:41
Right now?
Because there isn't that much in the way of buying goods and services (aside from illegal stuff), so it's only use is for illegal activities and speculation.

I'm personally looking at about 100M difficulty at the end of the year, but I just want to know what others think will happen. The formula I came up with gives the minimum hashing efficiency of the network to remain profitable at given prices. I'm just wondering what people believe will be happening at the end of the year, it's interesting, the two answers given so far result in about 3MH/J, and 15MH/J, both of those indicate that GPU mining will be a fringe, if existent at all. The current min-efficiency I estimate (for comparison) is .5MH/J.

Parse the blockchain for unspent coins.

Not for long. At this point even a GPU is unprofitable.

I said I would be disappointed if terrorists weren't using Bitcoin to anonymously transfer money (which by the way is the selling point I was talking about).
You can replace "terrorists" with any person or group and my statement would still be the same. Like it or not, with an unregulated thing like Bitcoin, you have to take the bad with the good.

What most of the people on this subreddit don't get about investors is that they don't all view Bitcoin as a viable currency, and view it solely as an investment.

21% of all Bitcoins is 21% of the market cap, it's a significant number.

It may only be useful in the world of mathematics for proving or disproving conjectures, perhaps even offering new insight into how prime numbers work.
But, you can't deny that even that is more useful than finding an input that produces a double SHA256 hash with a number of leading zeros.
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:24:50
Do you really think the hashrate will hit over 200TH/s over the next year?
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:15:03
I usually make 1-10% per trade, and my trades usually take about an hour to complete (back and forth), so it sounds reasonable for me.
@_date: 2013-09-18 14:00:50
Bitcoin is so expensive because of how hard it is to get one.
My 50 mBtc is from a joke that I made a while ago, its pretty damn hard to get set up on an exchange if I don't want to give away my bank information, or my identify information.
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:11:37
Except mining on free electricity IS economically driven. They want the best possible profit margins.
@_date: 2013-05-13 04:49:16
You're missing my point. ~~Why would~~How could they overlook such a trivial and common bug?
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:37:52
At 10% hashrate, they can mine upwards of 360 BTC a day, that's around 41kUSD per day. 
They can most certainly use 41k per day to bring more hardware online to keep their percentage of the network hashrate stable.
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:59:48
Perhaps they wish to remain only 20% of the network?

The way you phrased it, I've seen people throw the word hand around to describe market manipulation before.

@_date: 2013-05-14 21:22:56
Does it actually though? Along the journey to Bitcoin becoming valuable, it will cost more and more fiat to buy into it. That sounds more like inflation than valuation.
