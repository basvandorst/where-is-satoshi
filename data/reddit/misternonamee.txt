it's slowly happening, for example alt coins are usually measured by satoshi's. I think the community really needs to start using satoshi's. I just recently realized how much easier it is when I was practicing on some trades. The trades were usually happening for around the price of 0.00065300 BTC. I quickly learned it's so much easier to just look it as 65,300 satoshi's. I think when this starts becoming more normal for people that's when the price of bitcoin will be easier to understand.

That's not okay to be so acceptable of those type of actions. That's not what bitcoin represents and you are encouraging that. Those are the type of actions that will make goverments regulate bitcoin as much as they can so I disagree with you. What coinbase did was corrupt and greedy, defending them by saying it's an unregulated market doesn't justify it. That doesn't make it 'okay' especially to goverments. If that shit keeps happening you best believe goverments will start banning exchanges left and right so we can't be so acceptable of that because it will backfire. And it's just wrong in general, it just shows that they're only here for greed, again why support a company that doesn't actually care?
To me it doesn't matter how fast we hit 20k. I think It's great that we are speaking against coinbase because guess what? Now we can have competition that will offer more support and help us climb even faster. The more competition the better for bitcoin. Coinbase had a chance to prove themselves but they proved they don't really care about bitcoin so we should let someone else take the throne who actually cares. That's better for bitcoins health. 
Anyways thank you as well, I respect your point of view as well! and I don't mean to be so negative. I do appreciate coinbase helping bitcoin get trendy, I just wish coinbase stayed on the right route but in my perception they took another route. 
My main point though, if we show support to other exchanges who care more, this will bring competition and competition always brings more uses to the table
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:56:51
I think you are looking at this totally wrong. First of all we never needed coinbase. This technology has been progressing regardless, all coinbase did is hedgefund the shit out of it. Coinbase has proven it's self to be one of the biggest enemies to Bitcoin so I can't believe your showing support. Have you missed all the spam/congestion they have caused spiking up fees and even publicly speaking against bitcoin? For a company making so much money and they never even implemented segwit, one of the biggest upgrades to bitcoins protocol currently. Have you missed the pump of their inside trading with bcash? 
Fuck coinbase. They're not with us and you should not be supporting them. They act like a bank and they will work with centralized banks anyday over supporting our decentralized beliefs. 
Coinbase does not deserve all this attention. 
If you want to spread the right message than you shouldn't be supporting a company who's against bitcoin and only uses it for profits...
They opened the door for a lot of noobs to come into the market but they also fucked up the hinges on the door when they opened it. If coinbase was truly a bitcoin supporter, trust me, this entire community would make it obvious and we would praise them like gods but that's definitely not the case.

What are you talking about? SegWit DOES come with BIGGER BLOCKS. Perhaps you should actually learn about it before talking shit.  You're obviously a shill who has no real knowledge. Increasing the blocksize already is in segwit but segwit is so much MORE than just that. Bcash ONLY increased blocksize, which doesn't actually solve shit and doesn't give it a promising future. Segwit is a nice upgrade that leads to many other upgrades such as LN which will be based off Segwit. But please educate yourself because segwit DOES increase the blocksize. You're just being lied to. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:43:03
perhaps not intentionally spamming but a big part of the spamming was coming from them and a company making those kind of profits they should have optimized a lot faster but I don't think it was in their interest since they were making shit load of profit regardless. Which is why I'm against them because i feel like they're the typical bank-like corperation that represents greed.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:28:14

That's a great point you made about robinhood. People think they are going to be great but all I see is more power of control. Especially that robinhood is highly connected with the IRS, I wouldn't be surprised if every single person is being tracked and traced who signs up with Robinhood. And asking for those credit reports is way to much, I never experienced that from any exchange. In fact the exchange I use only required me to sign up with an email and no ID! Which is how it should be at least with a trading limit, ID required only if you are moving big money.  We need this type of freedom.  Robinhood looks like the opposite of freedom and sadly they appear to have good marketing schemes especially because these new crypto people are pretty young, they are attracted to things like coinbase and robinhood which don't actually care about crypto revolution.

money doesn't have to be paper bills, in fact money can be anything me and you agree upon trading such as pokemon cards. I have pokemon cards that I can sell for a lot of USD cash or I can trade it for something else.  The reason crypto is worth a lot more than paper bills is because of what it has to offer us meanwhile paper bills don't have anything to offer us. Like I said to the other guy if you think the internet is apart of our future than crypto currencies are our future, this is envitable.  
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:01:21
bitcoin is still up over 100% since last year. Stock investors envy people in the crypto space. Stocks barely make you shit as a trader. Crypto is where the real money is at when it comes to trading. The crypto space will continue to be dominant and MANY people from stocks will gradually switch over to crypto, eventually crypto will overtake the stock market as these platforms start implynig themselves to businesses, this is envitable if you believe the internet is apart of our future.

anything can happen, I think whales will wait a little longer,perhaps to see if the support level drops. When they see a support level holding strong they will probably sky rocket the price. So far the 8k support level is strong, if it can hold for a week than I think we will see a nice bounce

them cashing in is not a bad thing at all, that means whales are exiting and those coins can go back into circulation, that's actually a great thing. but that's probably not what's happening anyway.

@_date: 2018-02-01 10:41:06
sounds like your head is just stuck in the system. Which makes a lot of sense because decentralisation is to get out of the enslaved system which is why the average person doesn't understand bitcoin because the average person is brainwashed by the society they grew up in. I realized the people who actually seek intelligence on their own and gain wisdom are the ones who begin to side with decentralisation. That being said, you should seek more insight because just doubting it doesn't come with any intelligence. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:16:27
EXACTLY. These are the same kids all over the sub cryptocurrency who try to be funny all the time making fun of each other and hating on BTC meanwhile they're the ones who are truly hurting and are deep down salty as fuck so they come to BTC to let out some steam, this is what reassures me we will bounce back up hopefully sooner than later.

currency is one of it's best uses. I think your only thinking about the nation you live in which probably has a stable currency. Bitcoin isn't going  to take over the USD in our generation. I'm sure another currency will in the future though. But the point of it is to be a decentralised trust-less peer to peer currency. Why should I pay a bank to hold my money and charge me interest when I can hold my own money with no cost at all? banks can also freeze funds from legitmate people because of system errors and what not. Bitcoin has no borders and doesn't care about race. Sadly banks only care about making a profit, banks do not reach out to people who actually need them in probably most of the world. Bitcoin will reach out to anyone in the world. Look at venezuela, their currency has went to shit. Bitcoin will save people from goverments like that. 
This isn't the best answer but like I said I can refer you to some youtube videos from a security expert

I don't understand what solution your providing here? Blockchain comes with a ton of innovation. What you suggests is the opposite of that (just accepting what we already have..) Blockchain comes with some of the smartest people in the world, coders. Look at Vechain for example and what it's blockchain/platform has to offer stopping counterfieting in the biggest industries in the world. Blockchain is bringing a new generation of people and ideas to help make the world a better place. Banks are not doing this at all, in fact banks have been holding us back for many years, they are so outdated it's a fucking joke. Anyways I'll still give you some videos to check out from a security expert/coder himself. If you can argue his points than maybe you have something going, I'm not no expert so I can't defend the blockchain in a technical matter like the person I will suggest can. But I don't know if you actually have any interest in learning about it.

The way I rose my value in BTC was just buying the dip, I would never sell and after every big drop I would just buy more.  Obviously you only want to buy what you can afford to lose but that's what worked for me since the price was at 2k. I remember when it first hit 5k and dropped to 2.8k, I was a noob and wanted to panic sell so bad but I ended up buying more nd I'm glad I did. It looks like crypto's in general are being attacked with FUD over the last 4 weeks and still on going. I suspect big pumps to start happening by march 1st.

Actually BTC has almost 10 years of history which is why people do trust it because of all the attacks it's prevailed while continuing to upgrade it's protocol.

larger dolphins are apex predators, meaning they are on top of the foodchain (;

If you only bought bitcoin from an exchange you had to verify your identity with but moved it to numerous wallets such as mobile wallet and hardware wallet and then used it to buy alt coins on an exchange you didn't need to get verified with, is there a way they can track all of these movements/trades ? I feel like there's many trades I don't remember or have forgotten.

Orcas actually belong to the dolphin family despite being called "killer whales" those are kinda the larger dolphins I was reffering to ;D

definitely look into learning more about it first, this is an advanced technology and you should understand it a little first before buying.  Also I would stay on the side lines for a few days, if the price doesn't drop more I would probably buy some.

prices will probably start bouncing back by march 1st. whales are also waiting to see when is a good time to get back in. Lots of support at 8.4k so chances are it will bounce up if it gets there

why did you not acknowledge the entire message retard?

if that's your logic than you are way to deep in your own head. 90% of actual hodlers constantly make new accounts. I try and make a new account every few weeks as well. Actual hodlers are actual hodlers who are pretty high when it comes to their holdings so they don't like to risk themselves getting exposed. A hacker can go through your entire post history and learn a lot about you.... which is why you shouldn't use your main account for crypto.

been here before 3k, definitely not getting out, this is super exciting

This isn't really a lesson for many of us. This is only a lesson to the noobs/newcomers who only came here from around October.

when salty fudders like you appear that makes hodlers even stronger...your taste buds are gonna go numb from all this salt mate

I made my post because most of this FUD is not well-reasoned. It's random accounts constantly copy/pasting something that they didn't back up with any reason and like I said most of these accounts are not replying to any of the people calling them out so it's no where near "well-reasoned" I am open to talk to any well-reasoned fudder because that's fair.  I've been here before the crypto hype train so I'm not under any spell mate. The spells started coming in when the hype started coming.

to many teenagers here. I'm actually very glad this dip is happening to shake them off, hopefully they leave for good, your 100$ didn't mean anything anyway lol.

I don't think that's very realistic, this market is to risky for them since it doesn't make much sense to them, they have no idea who's on the other side of this market. Also they would be at risk since exchanges can easily screw them
