Is that your argument to support the b2x attack? You haven't answered OP's question, he asked you to be precise and you avoided answering it. Answer please: Why do you support the attack if it is not for DCG's money?
Also, to use reddit gold to give the appearance of support for your comment is exactly the strategy that DCG is using at a larger scale: Using their money to buy "supporters" for their dangerous attack on bitcoin.

Let me see if I got this right: Are you asking the Mods to censor a user exposing the truth because he is posting from a one month old account? You came out openly supporting bx2 knowing very well that is an attack and attempt to centralise bitcoin and not an "upgrade", and you have tight financial ties with DCG, can you square that for us?

Do you? Why is that relevant?
What we know for sure is who owns both r/btc and bitcoin.com    ...that's right,  the same scammer that is profiting from promoting his scam site against Reddit rules and profiting from innocent bcash buyers. How much have you lost by now for holding bcash instead of Bitcoin?

I checked your post history and you are an r/btc troll. You are implying, like everybody there, that Blockstream controls Core, and Core controls Bitcoin. That has been debunked many times, Blockstream is a private company doing good things for Bitcoin an employs just a tiny fraction of the developers related to Core. Core is an open source and decentralized  project maintained by many developers (most of them have nothing to do with Blockstream), it is a transparent project without any sworn loyalties to Companies or individuals, unlike the centralized, buggy and shady S2X and Bcash altcoin projects, with well-known scammers as their leaders (Barry, Roger, Wright, Jihan).

10/10 statement! Right in the face of corrupted companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, Xapo, ShapeShift, BTCC, Gemini, OpenBazzar, Breadwallet, who came out in the open in support of the corrupted and centralized miners.

Thank you Bitrefill, you are among my favorite bitcoin companies.

Did you read OP's linked post? Do you seriously think that NYA is not an attack against bitcoin?

Your post history shows you are an r/btc troll and bcash lover, what are you doing here?
