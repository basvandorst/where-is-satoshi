I'm on voip.ms and they've been dragging their feet on SMS.  Do you support it?

Good point.  Did the coinbase marketing dept not realize this?  Is it just free marketing since they know they wont need to fund any discount?
edit: apparently some people can use ACH still: "It's not impossible, though. The exchange Bitcoin.de said some Greeks are managing to get bitcoins, because they still get access to online banking." (

but you'll never leave bc the hot robot will kill his master, lock you in a room and escape to a crowded intersection.

can i buy woth bitcoin in the US?
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:58:36
this is very real concern of mine.  and for those outside the US, think about leverage the US govt has outside of the country due to trade, defense and other favorable deals.  An example of this is the extension of the US copyright law to other countries.

Does step 2 enable step 3 or is there something else involved? 
What exactly happens to my account at settlement when the 10 contracts expire (assume btc spot static @ 400)?
1.  Use your $1000 to buy 2.5 bitcoin on OKCoin spot.
2.  Move your 2.5 BTC instantly from OKCoin Spot -&gt; Futures
3.  Sell 10 Contracts ($1000) short at $405 on Weeklies

I'm not a big fan of banks, but to be fair, in both of the cases, the people were breaking the law.  Lyndon's neice was structuring the liquor store revenue deposits to the bank.  Supposedly the bank teller told her to do it so she didnt have to do paperwork...right.  And the other guy was carong over $10k in cash over state lines.  It's very easy for a citizen in the US to get a free checking account in 24 hours and it's insured up to 250k.

compliance to FDA regulations is not the jurisdiction of the payment processor.

lack of fraud and fees save merchants money.  If they dont want to share those savings w me then I dont buy w bitcoin and make them pay more, otherwise I hold...its their money to lose

NOTHING,  in aml/kyc, fincen, etc says they cannot tell you why your acct was cancelled.  and dont give me "blah blah filters, fraud, whine whine".  They can give you a broad category without compromising their fraud filters.  This is coinbase failing.

lies, no reason not to categorize the denial for the user other than your fraud architecture designer is a moron with a god complex

ya, you're full of shit.  Even with free electricity,  you're losing $1/mo.
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:36:16
none of those options are any good.  you have a right to know why they cancelled your account.

One of the large btc escrow companies was contracted by the gov't to handle the xfer and sale of the coins.

ask to prepay for the year (or 6 mos) w/ btc, at the cred card price.
