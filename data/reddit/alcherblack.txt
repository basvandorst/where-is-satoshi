As an Android developer I must say that that is completely false, sadly. NEVER trust your phones with anything sensitive and always assume that their security is compromised. Have a look at this, for example: 
Basically, at this point of time, all mobile platforms are low hanging fruit for  criminals. Do not store any significant amount of BTC on your devices. There haven't been any (well-known) cases of theft for now, but there will be, trust me.

Also, do you know what fee does it charge for buying BTC?
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:43:48
I must note that while this is all well and good there is currenly no exchange operating in Japan. I lived there this summer and found no option available for bying Bitcoins for JPY (or any other currency) without it being prohibitively expensive. Even bying BTC from ANX in Hong Kong is cheaper even with the international banking transfer fees than using the bitcoin ATMs in Tokyo (they charge about 10-15%) or bying from bitflyer (currenly sells 1 BTC for 453 USD + fees while Bitstamp price is 427).

I must say that I am in love with the technology and the new possibilities bitcoin and the blockchain opens for a lot of old problems, but, the main issue I have is SECURITY.
There is just no freaking way a normal person can be expected to use bitcoin in more or less a secure fashion. Hell, even having some technical skill (namely, knowing about tails, tor, 2FA, etc) is not enough to protect you, as numerous people's stories about having their btc stolen will tell you. There is an incredible amount of angles of attack and ridiculous amount of measures you need to take not to be constantly scared about the security of your money. You need to know exactly what you're doing in order not to lose your money. Hell, even if there is no malicious entity acting against you, you can just make a mistake yourself. I often explain bitcoin to other people, and I get really excited and talk about the low fees, the instant global transfers, the movement from people-based technologies to algorithm-based technologies, etc., but then they ask me - "so how do I actually use it"? And unless they're talking about, like, 10$ worth of BTC in a blockchain wallet on their phones, I have to go on and start talking about Trezor, or multisig's, or signing transactions on a offline PC, or paper wallets printed on a offline PC booted from an optic disc with a non-networked printer... Yeah, good luck with widespread adoption.
And if we wait for services built on top of bitcoin that are insured, well, they will have to have about the same fees and problems as regular payment companies.
I still have a somewhat significant amount of my savings in Bitcoin, but that comes from living in a place where it actually makes sense and from vague thoughts about how it can be very useful in a corporate and small business setting, where there is huge risk for fraud and no free bank insurance (think 5 in 7 multisig wallets for company funds).
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:51:19
I would also like to know why that happened.
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:08:14
Then there should be no problem whatsoever. It costs almost nothing to add bitcoin as a payment option to the website, and it is indeed free press and drastically lowered transaction costs. Since you probably need to provide some document to prove you bought the ticket and board the bus compliance to laws also shouldn't be an issue.

@_date: 2015-01-20 13:24:50
An interesting question to ask would be this: where do the savings actually come from here? It's not like it's simply a bitcoin transfer, it involves an exchange in Korea and Circle in the US, both of which are companies that have to pay their employees, rent, taxes, etc.
I'd argue that the savings come from the fact that forex through Bitcoin is unregulated (yet), and this will change in the future, bringing the price closer to what international wire transfers and companies such as Western Union offer. I might be wrong, though. Any other ideas?

Thank you for the link. A great read, and illuminating.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:38:39
That's exactly what would happen. The problem, though, is that miners have all this expensive equipment and data-centers just sitting there...

I'm sorry, but this is just wrong. Russia has a (relatively) large deficit of the government budget. It also has a rather large amount of foreign debt compared to GDP. A bit lower than the U.S., but close.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:28:03
Yes, well, buy WHY is the price so high in banks? Competition should be driving it down. It's not like there is a monopoly in either the Korean or US banking sectors.

As a Russian, I sure hope he doesn't win. Probably won't need the bitcoin if I'm a draftee in the army taking over the Baltic states and Poland. Putin likes Trump for a reason, you know, he looooves his "We're not going to defend NATO countries", it's all over our TV.

Just think in terms of buying fractions if absolute values scare you (e.g. 10000 Satoshi = 1USD right now). It's the same thing with gold - 1 kg of gold is ~30k USD, but nobody thinks in those terms when buying gold.
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:50:28
Yeah, you just forgot to mention that you need millions of dollars of upfront investment into hardware.
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:37:31
Yup. The way this specifically works is: imagine those 1M coins aren't lost. Each time the price reaches a new high level, some percentage of people who own these coins decide to sell, which brings the price down or prevents it from increasing as fast. However, since these coins are in fact lost, these people can't sell, so the total pool of "sellers" is smaller.

I've been using QUOINEX, and they weren't asking for proof of residence when I registered, just the gaijin card. Another exchange (don't remember which) mailed a postcard to my address and then asked me for the code on it.

It works about the same way as [gold]( getting more valuable over time (from 400USD/oz in 2003 up to 1700USD/oz in 2012).

1. Possible, but unlikely, since as time goes on, better and safer technologies for managing your keys are being developed. A lot of people lost coins when their HDDs failed - today all major wallets offer some form of backup.
2. You can print multiple copies of your private keys. Not only that, you can use multi-signature paper wallets - so, say, you can create a 2-out-of-3 wallet and can store one piece at a vault in your bank, one piece on your person, one piece at home.
3. Shouldn't be a problem - the network evolves by consensus, and it's unlikely that a fork that isn't backwards-compatible will ever gain traction. I don't think there is a realistic chance of old private keys ever being invalidated in any way. Maybe you won't be able to claim some of the value of bitcoin forks - either due to no value being left (e.g. Bitcoin Cash going to &lt;1USD/BCH) or due to smaller forks changing the rules of the protocol in a way that would burn older coins in some way (e.g. by introducing inflation).
4. Smaller blocks are unlikely, since bitcoin is potentially infinitely divisible - so if the value and adoption continues to grow, the number of transactions shouldn't ever fall all esle being equal. It's just that a single average trade will be nominally smaller, but the value will still be the same.
@_date: 2015-09-06 11:37:52
It's not tiny for all other crypto apart from Bitcoin, because scrypt.

The coins are lost, but the value isn't - it's just evenly distributed across everyone who hasn't lost their coins.

$100 becoming $75M is impossible - that would imply a 60 quadrillion USD market cap for bitcoin.
What could (but is unlikely to) happen is another 10-100x increase, e.g. if Bitcoin supplants gold (500 billion to 10 trillion market cap) as the world's reserve asset.

Pravda was one of the main (if not THE main) newspapers in the Soviet Union. "Pravda" literally translates to "Truth", which is supremely ironic since it was (as all Soviet newspapers were) full of propaganda of various degrees of blatancy. It's no longer a major newspaper in Russia today.

Indeed! And for many countries, interest is negative (meaning that creditors are paying countries to hold their debt). I sometimes feel that would be better if government debt was called something else, because it is utterly misleading to talk about it in the same terms as, say, consumer loans...
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:42:42
No, actually, it's very possible (and companies are selling this service, or at least claiming to be selling it) to determine who controls the private keys of an address since you can just see where the transactions come from, right until you get to a known source (e.g. exchange). Mixers help, but technology to de-obfuscate mixing also exists.

Er, if you start a company, you own 100% of it. All the shares. You don't "get" anything from anybody, it's just yours. If you have a cofounder, then it's usually 50-50 or 40-60. If there are external investors coming in, then the situation changes a bit, so in the end usually founders end up don't owning that much. Google's founders, I think, own only about 3-4 percent of the company each. I'd say it reflects the evolution of the company and their contribution quite nicely.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:08:46
Just a side note: it's I feel it's a bit misleading to say that bitcoin is anonymous. Or, rather, it is anonymous, but it's perfectly traceable - I think it's an important caveat that a lot of people are missing.
Bitcoin is anonymous in the same way as pre-paid Visa cards are - they are not linked to your identity until someone decides to look, and then they can, e.g., go to the shop that sold you the card and ask for the video footage. Same with bitcoin - except that's it's arguably much easier since all transactions are public on the blockchain and all major exchanges require extensive identification. 
Cryptocurrencies that are anonymous in the way that people are thinking (with untraceable transactions) do exist, but Bitcoin is explicitly NOT that.

Hearing on cryptocurrency in Congress: 
Relevant quite:


Hypothetical scenario: Imagine you visit a country, and exchange currency at a bank. They take a copy of your passport. You then go into the street a buy, say, ice-cream from a vendor on the street. He then puts on a mask and goes and uses that money to buy something illegal, say, a [full-flush]( toilet in Massachusetts. Law enforcement busts the seller and seizes the money. They can look at the serial numbers and look up which bank these specific notes were delivered to. They then can ask the bank - hey, who did you give the money to? They give law enforcement your information, law enforcement comes to you, and ask you who did you give the money to. That is how the seller can be identified. He can then try to lie about it, saying he bought something else - but he's already attracted the attention of law enforcement, and that's usually enough. Here's an example from 1930 of a faily wide-scale effort (serial numbers in a paper): [link](
What I'm saying is what you described above about the 20$ is actually pretty much exactly how it works - you won't be in trouble, but you might have to say who you have the 20$ to.
Bitcoin makes the above scenario even easier since all of the intermediate transactions are entirely visible to anyone and recorded forever (by design!). What you are describing above (shuffling bitcoin between addresses) would help about the same as shuffling a stack of cash before buying whatever you want to buy. Unless you are willing to convincingly lie about who owns the addresses you've been selling to, you might be in trouble (depending on what the bitcoins were used for).
Edit: [another]( cash example: a dude kidnapped a businessman, got ransom, used to money to pay for groceries in a supermarket, government database detected that the note was flagged when the supermarket brought the money to a commercial bank, law enforcement talked to the supermarket, they got the guy.

Also: [EU Commits €5 Million to Fund Blockchain Surveillance Research](
I'd advise you to look into private cryptocurrency (e.g. XMR) if you actually want privacy. However, right now actually using any of the private coins might attract even more attention, since any usage outside of trading is low.
