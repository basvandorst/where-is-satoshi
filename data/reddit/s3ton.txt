Try bluewallet : it’s a very easy to use Lightning and btc wallet

Btc is the only crypto not controlled by a single entity.
All the other coins have someone that created them with some agenda that have an enormous influence over it.
Meanwhile Satoshi Nakamoto is not around anymore and some of the big companies that tried to change the bitcoin protocol couldn’t do it 2 years ago when their proposed hard fork did not happen.
Transaction fees can already be lowered if you use the Lightning network. Try eclair wallet for example or bluewallet.
At some point the exchanges will start using Lightning as well

It is stated many times in the guide that LN is still in development.
This guide is for hobbyists, not for businesses
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:08:23
There are already solutions to this
Non all the wallets implement them

Read: bitcoin.org/en/faq
After reading that, if you still think it is a good idea buy some BTC, don’t go all in at first.

Just go to lnbig.com and request a channel to your wallet.
As soon as the channel is active you will be able to receive without having spent any money

I’d suggest just using numbers from 1 to 10.000 and pick the closest guess if no one guesses right.

Don't spread lies or propaganda.
Lightning **is** trustless

For btc to not fall below 500k a coin you will have to wait more than 10 years
@_date: 2018-06-28 07:44:32
Many people will not even want to use bitcoin until many years in the future.
in 10 years you have potentially 1 billion people using LN which would turn Bitcoin into one of the most used currencies in the world.

Try Greenaddress.  
It was one of the first to implement segwit upgrade and is updated and maintained for many years now.  
You can also set the fees manually which is very important.  
Make sure to avoid bitcoin.com

The best thing is to use nice hash,
you don't mine bitcoin directly but instead you mine the most profitable coin and are payed in bitcoin by them.

Definitely 2014 Mt.Gox crash.  
My first crash, you never forget your first 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:31:22
Make sure to mine using Slush Pool instead of the default

if you liked my answer make sure to upvote it (like I did with yours) so other people can find it easily

No it's not.
You do a transaction on the blockchain only when you move money from exchange into your wallet
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:44:39
Most of those transactions are going to be cleared during the weekend.  
difficulty doesn't matter much. if it's going up it means we produced 2016 blocks in less than 2 weeks.  
keep in mind that price is surging to new highs so we will get more hashing power because bitcoin is more profitable.

my short answers:  
1) bitcoin is not intended to replace all the money like USD or Euro. it is intended for store of value like gold but much easier to trade. so in the best case scenario it will be like gold reserves for major countries.  
2) Debts and taxes are very likely to be denominated in fiat money imho.  
3) Decentralization is important because it means that nobody can shut it down. no bad government or mafia....
it is important for the world, especially for countries that have bad governments like china, Venezuela, North Korea to have a way to store money without fear of it being stolen

Blockstream green wallet.
It’s open source.
It’s for iOS and android and its very safe because to spend the bitcoin you can use a second factor like google Authenticator.
That means no one can spend the btc but you.

No one running a full node (you can easily do it by downloading Bitcoin core) would accept invalid blocks eventually leading to that miner to lose the reward in favor of honest miner that will keep mining on the valid chain
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:05:44
Wish it was my mom
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:43:14
Yes but then you don’t help the network because you are unable to serve old blocks
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:14:49
As soon as we switch to satoshi being the unit this will sort by itself

In my opinion LN could work like this:
Step 1
A company, that we will call lightningPay, installs a LN pos in a business, for example a pizza restaurant. 
The restaurant has an account with lightiningPay and can decide each month if they want to receive money in bitcoin or fiat or 50% each.
This wallet has a channel open with an exchange funded with 50$ worth of bitcoin (either lightningPay money or restaurant money, depends on their agreements)
Step 2
Customers pay 5$ worth of btc to the restaurant via lightning network for a pizza.
Step 3
The restaurant pos sends 5$ worth of btc to the exchange over LN.
Step 4
The exchange sells 5$ worth of bitcoin received in the channel on the market (they sell other bitcoins, from people that have deposited the btc on the exchange for example just like a bank).
Step 5
Every time the channel is full (meaning that the total amount of the channel which was 50$ worth of btc is all sent to the exchange) the restaurant can close the channel and open a new one called channel 2.
The exchange will start to receive more bitcoin from the new channel 2 and can now sell the bitcoins that were locked in the channel 1 on the market.
People that deposit their btc on the exchange will provide the liquidity necessary to the system to keep going.
People will have an option on the exchange: keep funds on wallet A for trading (earn 0% interest) or keep funds on wallet B for deposit (earn 1% interest for example).
In this way you avoid any bank run or fractional reserve risk

It is possible today to setup a multisig 2-2 that can be spent either with both signatures or with 1 signature after x amount of time.
You keep both keys for yourself and you go to your family and give the copy of 1 key and you tell them that if something happens to you they will be able to swipe the Bitcoin after say 5 years from now.
Then if you are still alive and well after 5 years you move the funds from that address into another one with the same mechanism for another 5 years.
No need to trust your family
