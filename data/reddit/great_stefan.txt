I was using getgems from the beginning, I was excited to have a messenger with wallet functions.  
But I saw that every update was worse then previous version and they wasn't focus on how to make the wallet to work better.  
I hoped that this app will rise but I think is losing from now. Be careful transferring BTC with that wallet. Is confusing with fees and change addresses or sidechains.  
Sometimes the fee is normal but sometimes is much bigger with no explanation.  
So I suggest precaution until they will have a real wallet. Otherwise yes is just another messenger...
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:20:15
So now getgems every major update will change the wallet? Not trusted anymore. I moved my satoshis from that wallet long time ago when I saw that the fees are 8000 bits just to send 100 bits through getgems.... No other wallet will do that or at least will give me an alert or something.  
I think getgems lost a good start... Sad but true.
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:29:51
So why when I sent through getgems 0.0002 the fee was 0.008? And I'm not the only one, also a friend that have the same or even much expensive.  
I repeated the same transaction through electrum and the fee was 1k satoshi.  
If there is such a case of high fee, the user should be informed in getgems.

Holly crap you still use libero.it email sever?! And you expect to have your bitcoins safe? That email server is full of spammers and usually gets hacked.  
Why people don't use a personal email domain in a secured hosted server? Or even you can setup your own at home.

The Gates move towards cryptocurrencies is fishy.

You get the point. Exactly this I want to say and all guys here start labelling me like sexist. I just want to see more girls into bitcoin. I want to hear their opinion.  
But seems that on this reddit most of users are missing the point (the message) and start labelling first the messenger. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:32:53
I think Coinbase just got a Trojan horse inside   
Being in bed with banks will not end too good or will be good only for the banks. And Bitcoin doesn't need "scenarios" like these.  
As far I know BBVA is not a "good bank" (if I can say like that).

+1 for good initiative, but is useless to put time and effort in this when they will die anyway soon. Fight for bitcoin adoption, ask your employer to pay you in btc and in that way you kill paypal without any effort.
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:47:48
I'm not trying that. Bitcoin need to be spent in mass in order to be largely adopted. So let the women spend it, you take care of obtain it...
@_date: 2015-01-23 09:31:10
You do not need to spend $200 to buy a whole bitcoin. You can easily purchase as little as $1 worth, or one milli-bitcoin. Not expensive.

Get out of Whatsapp spyware! Take GetGems app   
You can access your wallet on your getgems account and/or Counterwallet.io with your 12 words generated wallet.  
You can send gems or bitcoins to your contacts or through counterwallet.io to any other wallet.  
I was using Telegram but now I use only GetGems (have the same contacts and based on same open source platform).  
I think is the best mobile chat app/btc wallet combination!  
But I actually have one question to developers: how will be sent BTC if I am in a group chat in GetGems ? Split the total amount between participants or like in ChangeTip using the user name and the amount?

@_date: 2015-01-22 09:09:22
Good point.  
Banks NEVER "invest" in something that doesn't have immediate/sure/big profit or will do it to destroy that business.  
You will never see a bank funding to build a hospital/school/water purification system. Take the example of JP Morgan that was financing N. Tesla to build his tower and his other inventions and once he was almost done and JP Morgan realized that will be free energy, he cut the funds and destroy the tower, hiding the plans... History is repeating over and over again.

Are you willing to accept an IOU piece of paper saying I will give you some day 1 BTC? I don't think so.

You still consider this fair?
@_date: 2015-08-31 12:40:33
Yep, with bitcoin you can do it even further: smart contracts, you win the lottery then automatically have the coins.
@_date: 2015-08-31 08:13:32
People don't get it wrong and read the again the article. 
Barclays is TAKING your coins in form of donations, NOT accepting it like a form of payment! This is not "embracing the bitcoin" moment... this is just another shity paid news by the bank to attract new fool clients. THEY ARE DESPERATE because are losing clients....  
NEVER trust a bank! They will do whatever is possible to take your money not giving you more.  
When I will see the title: "Barclays bank start paying their employees ONLY in BTC" then I will consider a great news... otherwise is just a joke.
@_date: 2015-08-31 08:03:40
I don't see it like a great news for bitcoin...  
This is just another paid news by the bank to wash their image in order to attract more not well informed people.  
A great news will be Barclays bank start paying in BTC all their employees. Then the revolution start over.  
People should understand that a paying in BTC is the "killer app" not only accepting.  
We should be more "vigilant" with these kind of news about banks and bitcoin. A bank will NEVER do something good for people, but just for their ass...

As I said, don't thinking in fiat conversion of those fees. let's pretend for a moment that fiat doesn't exist. So we have fees of 10k satoshis for a simple transaction to pay let's say a parking lot for 1h. For a decentralized network, with no evil banks and other intermediaries, we should have way more cheaper fees. I mine too and I don't expect to earn lots of coins with that, I'm doing it more to keep the network up and running. Actually I'm mining just to be able to pay the fees for my regular payments in BTC...
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:05:36
yep true, why he insist so much with these stupid "donations"? What is the link with the "refugees"? A real help will be to take some of them at his home not donating to an obscure ONG in BTC, or even giving directly to some refugees some coins, but I'm 100% that none of them heard about BTC.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:15:34
yeah yeah so what's the point donating to a group of gamers so they will raise some money so they can donate them to charity... instead of just donating the money directly to those in need?  
This is like a banking game, intermediaries for charities...  
BTW the AbleGamers are quite obscure organization with a PO Box for registrant of the domain ...
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:36:59
The whole "refugee crisis" is a hoax created by ISIS (CIA).  
Instead of giving to syrian people help to re-build their country, US&amp;EU govs are bombing them more. All those money for bombs and arms can build from scratch not only Syria but also another countries.  
Why I don't see Obama and his fascist corporations to donate for those "refugees" or start sending to Syria companies to rebuild the infrastructure and economy, but instead they send planes and troops to bomb and kill more innocent people. They do nothing against ISIS because THEY are the ones that created that monster.  
So you now begging to give money to those "refugees" will not solve anything.  
More details here, Is not the place on this sub to debate with you a lost cause...   
So please stop this BS begging for "refugees" here... Bitcoin is not for beggars or at least put those "refugees" to play some faucets... so they can earn they own satoshis not begging.

My mom (68) is playing faucets all day. She have lot of time now. She watched all Andreas videos and she follow all the news related.  
In 2013 when I tried to explain her for 1st time about bitcoin, she was quite skeptical. But she didn't forget my words. She start reading more and then came back to me asking me to help her to setup her first wallet. She wanted to try. Then I explained her about faucets, that are good to try to see how is to earn, receive, make transfers etc.  
She have now quite a good stash from faucets. She's a HODL-er! She really believe that some day bitcoin will thrive.  
Few weeks ago she send me an email asking from where to buy some coins from her pension. I told her to keep the money because I will send her some coins instead. She insist that she want to learn how to buy BTC from an exchange. So I visit her and show how to make an account and buy some coins, then withdraw them into her Mycelium wallet.  
The whole thing with the old generation is to have patience and explain them like for a 5 year kid. If they have few basics in using a computer, they will do it! Even the security measures they understand (she have a backup keys on an encrypted  USB stick!).  
She told me that now she have own bank always with her...
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:17:59
That's not cheap, and I'm not thinking in $ but in satoshis. So for 1 cup of coffee I will pay 1/10 of fee. How we gonna promote bitcoin with cheap or no fee to new adopters if we already charge this huge fees ? Soon will become like visa fees so people will start thinking that worth using BTC.  
Seriously what options we have for lower fees?

In few years USD and all other fiat will be history. So is useless thinking how much shit will worth your BTC in few years. Be happy you have those BTC. Do you really you will sell when the fiat you get for it will worth nothing?  
What makes you think that what you are buying now with $100 in 5 years will buy with $100000...
@_date: 2015-09-27 10:14:56
Central banks wasted more energy and trees to print those paper money. Can you imagine how many trees they cut to make 1 trillion USD (only) ? And how many CO2 was created just to manufacture the paper, the ink, the printing machines, how many times the workers fart?  
Mining bitcoins is not cutting trees so you should be happy because if 1 tree remain alive will absorb more CO2 that you (only) can generate in your life.
@_date: 2015-11-19 19:48:55
Hahaha actually this question is really cool. We should save it in a internet archive or something and see in few years again the answer.

So at the end this guy was right in his assumptions, 2 months ago: 
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:51:11
Not everything needs to be converted in fiat money and in special in USD... We are more and more people that really not think anymore in fiat.  
Even so, if every month we will increase the fee with 5k satoshis in 1-2 years you will not say that 5000 satoshis are nothing.  
Increasing exponentially the fees for BTC txs will push away all new users/adopters because they will see that VISA tx will be less and less expensive.
@_date: 2015-10-11 10:04:22
I wasn't thinking about this kind of extreme measure. But drastic laws/licenses/regulations can be implied on other non-directly things but related to bitcoin. Let's say a regulation imposed by ISP on the traffic on port 8333 or on all ports. So the users with nodes will be affected and also the rest of bitcoin users.
@_date: 2015-10-10 09:20:22
Behind 21 Inc are many forces that want to see bitcoin dead. They saw that can't fight directly with bitcoin, so they bring up these strange company 21 Inc. with huge resources. Will make it to be "loved" by new bitcoiners and used by already bitcoiners until their loved devices will do the dirty work for them - spy on you. Now they are accumulating users and data. Then will start to analyze it and find a solution to control all of this. They know that bitcoin cannot be crushed but they think can be a way to control it.

I am true about the high price: I bought 0.08BTC paying 19.94€, that means an exchange rate of 248€/BTC. At that time the rate on bitcoin.de was 225 and average rate in mycelium of 228. That means BitBoat was at the highest peak in that day.  
You know I can prove that so don't make me liar again. Being sincere is better than making me a liar. At the end I'm not the one that is managing BitBoat so I don't have nothing to lose. In exchange you have a lot to lose...

Any ATM if is NOT accepting coins means will never give coins... because they don't have them. Those people that was using your services, I'm sure they go inside the bank and they make the deposit to the cashier not to the ATM.  
Sorry if you missunderstand me, I have nothing against your services (I really appreciate it) but you should be more transparent and detailed in how to use those services.  
I am a very informed person, but just think about a new person that want to buy some bitcoins using ATMs so they have no idea about all of these details. If you start with missing information all the users will go away and also not only that will not trust your services but will think that bitcoin is a scam...
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:52:40
Why not? Bitcoin is not a viable solution? In your opinion we should go back to VISA expensive txs?
@_date: 2015-10-20 10:52:25
I don't want a new web page with integrated payment system and I don't want to change anything. I just want to be able to offer to clients a bitcoin payment. After they drink their beer or eat their meal, instead of paying with credit card or cash, just an option (whatever it is) to pay with bitcoins the amount of the ticket already printed in eur.
@_date: 2015-11-21 16:37:54
Wrong title. Is not a bitcoin debit card. Is a fiat debit card. VISA is not working with bitcoin transaction, is a bank tx. So people are misleading totally the whole concept of these cards.

First of all the majority of people still don't know what are the money.  
Maybe 50% of those that doesn't know when they will watch Andreas speech (this one for example  will have a spark in their mind and start thinking.  
From those 50% that wakes up a bit, will be like another 50% that will really understand from where the money comes and will start using bitcoin. Half of these will still have diffculties to use it because they don't really understand how to use it.  
I think we want too much from a population that is not well educated.  
Can you explain why in schools they don't teach about money? When they teach kids about 1+1 I think that is the moment when they should start learning about money, basic things and later more and more. But you will not see this in schools. NEVER. Because they don't want you to be smart and know too much things. So from there is coming this "apathy" you are talking about new things...

What do you expect from banksters? This is a clear message that they are so afraid of bitcoin that are desperate to slow down the adoption, until they will come up with a shity solution but presented to large masses like the best solution.

Mark my words, this will gonna happen... if we don't "retaliate".

Gmail has to do with all phishing emails because not only YOU are the one that is reading your emails.  
You never ask yourself why you receive those email, how did they know that address to send you a phishing email.  
Because gmail is selling all your info to 3rd parties and you end up in a scamming list.  
Stop hosting your email on gmail, Hotmail, yahoo etc big data centers. Make your own domain, your hosting even.

you should change a bit the way users can put the amount in EUR. I see that only the btc field can be adjusted. How do you want me to send 47,57 eur in ATM? Leave the option to users to put for example 50 eur and the btc amount to be automatically adjusted. Now can't be edited and for that many users will not buy because they can't put in atm machine fractions of eur.

You catch the point but I think is at reverse. Who will invest in companies that are creating innovations based on bitcoin blockchain (not banks blockchain) will be richer than those who now are holding bitcoins and thinking that in near future the price in fiat of those bitcoins will be much higher. No sense in being rich in a fiat that nobody will use it anymore.  
Bitcoins are limited, blockchain innovation is unlimited.

You could simply encrypt your phone if you are afraid of losing it. I mean real encrypting not just putting a password to open the slide screen.  
  
I really NOT recommend to put any personal info on dropbox or other like services.  
If you really want that you father to have a copy of your wallet (just in case), you can install the same Mycelium on his phone and restore your wallet with the same key into his phone.  
Same wallet you can have it restored into Electrum and that Electrum wallet file you can keep it on an encrypted USB drive using Bitlocker

My mom is retired and she like to play some. She's doing quite good job also.  
epay.info rotator is giving good reward at the end of the week  
bitcoinaliens and weekendbitcoin are good and serious too  
For those who have a xapo account play the fieldbitcoins,  moonbitcoin and bitcoin zebra. These are paying instant to your xapo account. Others that says are paying to xapo actually are just grabbing your email used with xapo and give nothing.  
You have to be careful, out there there are a lot of scams.

How many days you lived in communism? I bet none. And what you know about communism is from history books. You know nothing.  
In communism the whole economy is programmed by central, nothing you can sell/buy, establish a price without a central approval. also the profits are programmable. If you didn't hear yet, there are "plans" for each 5 years, where everything is programmable.  
The "programmable economy" is a fashioned way to say the same thing.
