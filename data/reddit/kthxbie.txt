deposit your funds from coin base into GDAX (same login details - they are both owned by the same company) and then withdraw BTC from GDAX (for free) into another wallet of your choice.
or you can send from GDAX to another exchange instead and sell from there.

A friend of mine runs a (very) small business that rents out bee hives to people in the city. The work is done outside his normal working hours as it's not very profitable (I believe it just covers costs). 
Perhaps not the kind of charitable cause your looking for but bees need all the help they can get! Especially our native guys... 
Checking the Site it looks like the news section could use an update, but he now has 2 very young children so I'm sure he's a bit short on time.

I am doing the same thing this year.
Planning to use tails to make a wallet with electrum, write down the seed and print off a copy the qr codes using an off-line version of bitaddress.org I'll also include a little about section that details what version of software was used incase of issues in the future.
This slip of paper will be laminated, and I'll use a permanent marker to cover the private key and qr code. This can be removed at a later date with a whiteboard marker or other solvent to show what's underneath.

What's the solution to selling from coin base? Can you just transfer out into a wallet and then use another exchange to sell?

How do you know when the price has finally landed? I'm just watching it go up and down and have no idea what's coming next!

Thanks for the info!
Not looking to become a day trader, just interested in how other people do things.

Care to elaborate?

This is what I thought when it was at 3k... Ended up buying at 12k. No way to know what will happen, but if you make sure that you can afford to lose whatever your investing then it's always a good time to buy. I believe that regardless of any slump in the coming days, it will eventually bounce back as adoption increases. HODL!
