This guy still acting the bully at 70 years of age.
Insecurity written all over him.

Thought this one looked interesting. Donating to archive.org, wikileaks, bitcointalk, Snowden defence etc all in one.
Anyone know how someone can include payments to many addresses in the one transaction?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:12:58
97% of transactions have been China. We're just a tiny fraction and there's not much we can do really.

One simple way is to look at the left-hand axis on bitcoinity. That shows the volume.
For example if I set it to 30 days, on CNY BTCC exchange I see the axis runs up to 6 million. But then if I look at USD Bitfinex, it only goes up to 60k.
I know it's not totally accurate, and you might say I should look at all exchanges, but I've read analyses back from June saying it's about 80% China and rising, and a more recent one saying it was now up to 97%. Sorry I don't have those reference here.

You mean third chance.

First time I've heard the term "bankchain".
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:40:07
Wow you were right with the prediction (when there was a break upwards at ~934) and right again when you said there'd be a bounce off 950 (an upwards one :D )
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:08:45
Good prediction!

It seems clear already that it's not going to be the Bitcoin blockchain that banks use, but it would still be great to see blockchain technology used more behind the scenes in banks.

Thanks. That Water Project seems cool.
They show a map where they've installed water wells and you can see functionality data on each one and how many people each one serves. There's much more of them than I thought.

I hadn't seen this before: 
I suppose it shows the main activity is Chinese buying and the reason is that their own currency is being devalued?

Your post was quoted by Yahoo News here: 
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:27:38
Absolutely. 
And another thing new users who weren't around in 2013 need to know: The price *will* crash. It might happen at 1.2k, it might be at 5k, it might be at 10k. No-one knows where. But what no-one can deny is that it _will_ happen. The price will plummet. For hours, maybe even days on end. At speeds as fast as it's rising now. Falling by 2, 5, 10% a day and with no end in sight.
New users should be prepared for that, I certainly wasn't ready for that feeling in 2013, panic as you watch your money drain away. Make a decision now on what to do now when it happens and stick to it. Any decisions you make in panic will most likely not be sound.

Another interesting graph would be one which shows a moving average. Seeing as we've never been above $600 for this long before, I'd imagine a moving average with a window size of about 90 days or so could show us at an all time high now. It would certainly smooth out that peak in late 2013.

Move the 1 and 3 close together. What do you get? B. What does B stand for? Billion. Bitcoin. Billcoin.

not guaranteed by any means, it would be great to see it top $1,000 absolutely, but I wonder what would happen if it falls off, and if we've already seen the peak of this latest rally.

did I calculate the days wrong?
me too by the way. $10 times :D 
@_date: 2016-11-23 19:05:18
This is great, thanks a lot!

This is what apophenia looks like.
@_date: 2016-12-22 00:00:01
Yeah I don't think there are too many newcomers if any. Just talking to ourselves mostly.

Hold on to your gentlemen

I don't think anyone ever suggested you could earn more from bitcoin faucets than from having an actual job.

They were silently buying cheap, now they wanna sell for profit so they publish this.
