Did any of you read the entire article? It’s incredibly positive toward bitcoin If you don’t take the introduction out of context like the OP.  
Article tldr- bitcoin is better than gold or commodities in many respects, and is likely to gain legitimacy as an asset in the future.

New to bitcoin but after a little research, here is a metaphor I used to try and explain it to my friends. Please let me know where I could refine it for future use.
 
I kinda think bitcoin forms like ice.  
People who bought long ago are like vast permafrost ice sheets that haven’t melted in years, weathering any storm, maybe even willing to hold to 0 purely on cypherpunk principles rather than economic sense.  
Then you get a layer beginning from 2017, new ice but solid, been through some heavy storms but still forming at the top and willing to sell at some point, although if some didn’t at 3k, I don’t know what will make them sell.  
Then you have these new buys at at skyrocketing prices looking for continual gains, fresh snow and ice shards. Some will melt away, but a new layer of ice will surely form from the remains of every melt.  
The layers keep building, and Bitcoinberg keeps growing.   
Banks are the Titanic.
