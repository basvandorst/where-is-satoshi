Will full nodes have to have all UTXO's in memory when Bitcoin becomes widely adopted? If the average UTXO has 1 mBTC then how much memory will it take to support the whole network?? At first I thought UTXO's will become smaller with time but I suppose you can recombine them into larger denominations. Is there a number on (let's say if some countries with cumulative population 200 million) adopt BTC, what the equilibrium average memory required / UTXO amount be?

But isn't the signature only required to validate that Alice is spending from a UTXO that gave her the BTC? From what I know a txn looks like this:
    # (X -&gt; A)
    signed by Alice
    19.5 BTC
    "You can use this as a UTXO if you have Bob's address"
Where X is the person who gave Alice her BTC, and  -&gt; A) is the txid of Alice getting that BTC.
So it looks like Charlie doesn't need to know Alice's private key to change the destination of the transaction Alice wrote.

It seems that according to here (in the part before P2PKH Validation section) the person composing the txn (in our case Alice/Charlie, and in the guide's case, Bob) is signing just scriptPubKey from the txn where they got the money...

(I believe this is a pre-segwit question but) in the signature script part of a txn input, does the person writing the txn "sign" the fact that they HAVE the utxo?

Another thing I'd like to ask:
Let's say Alice made a txn to Bob. She gives Bob 19.5 BTC and 0.5 BTC of fees). Say Charlie sees this txn and changes it so that Alice is sending Charlie 19 BTC with 1 BTC of fees. Isn't it a security concern since miners might want to take Charlie's transaction first and then reject Alice's intended transaction?

Hmm... On the surface I don't think every person will only have one UTXO. But I bet wallets already regulary converge them into one to save space on the network. Still though, that's... a lot of RAM.

To prove that you didn't already spend a UTXO, do miners have to look through the blockchain ensure there is no transaction that already spends the UTXO?

Thanks, I understand now.
