Bitcoin is trustless. I don't believe in bigger blocks because Satoshi believed in it. I don't believe in bigger blocks because Gavin believes in it.
Seems like a reasonable change while we look for other options. So sure, I'd download and run a wallet/node that had the larger block size change in it but not because either of those people say so...
As a side note, it would have taken Satoshi about the same amount of time to add the missing if statement as it did to write the the post saying it was temporary....so...there's that..

You can't store documents themselves in the blockchain (thank goodness) - can you imagine the bloat?
You can do something like you suggested where you keep a file someplace and store a hash of it in the blockchain which secures both its date and contents pretty well.
You mention you are familiar with proofofexistence. They seem to be doing it in a pretty reasonable way.
Their technical summary of their approach seems pretty clear  and so I see no compelling reason to do something different. If you want to do it yourself in a complex way vs. relying on a service that could go away, then take a look at  or

A potential hard fork is a 'big deal' but I think most people agree we should do something. The question is can we build consensus for a few otherwise forking proposals and cut them in at the same time. For example, we could cut the average difficulty calculation and block rewards in half maintaining the same average coin creation rate and and also increasing theoretical TPS.

This is not dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging would buy a fixed dollar amount of bitcoin so if the price were low you'd automatically buy more coins and if high you'd buy less. This results in your average cost per coin being less than the average price per coin which is the theoretical advantage to dollar cost averaging.
You've selected periodic regular purchases which is not a terrible idea but not the same thing.

Whether your wallet is online or offline, there is no difference in risk. Nothing about having your wallet 'online' will prevent duplicate addresses.
As for the 'however unlikely it may be'. If you risk tolerance is really actually 0, then bitcoin, dollar, gold, and life in general are not for you. I know that sounds a bit snarky (it probably is) but the risk is essentially zero.

The short answer is - no. Or at least said another way, he was never even charged with this. In the days after Ross was arrested the crypto-community was starting to rally behind him. Within days, the NY prosecution publicly raised the idea that there was evidence of a murder for hire. This caused support to drop since of course we all know that you can always trust an agent of the state to be truthful.  Even looked at with the most charitable view of events one certainly can't make this claim very strong since as I said not only was this not proven in a court of law, formal charges were not even brought so the argument surrounding this assertion were never heard. So sure we can probably say "I don't know" here just as we can say "I don't know" if you perhaps killed someone.  
There are some things that we do know.  
1. We know charges of murder for hire were never formally brought forward ([
2. We know that the agents that were investigating silk road had full admin rights to the servers for a long time and could plant any evidence they wanted but more importantly, we know that the agents were criminals who stole large quantities of bitcoin during the investigation, were charged for this and were sent to to jail [ and we know that the jury was not allowed to know that the evidence against Ross was generated by these criminal agents.
3.  We know the person Ross was asserted to have tried to have killed when asked if he feared for his life if Ross was released said no but when asked the same question about the federal agents serving time for their involvement in the case, he said yes.
Any time someone is charged and goes to jail there is always a parent or friend or group of people that make the case that the person does not belong there. Sometimes they are correct. Sometimes they are misguided. Having looked at this, I think there was a huge miscarriage of justice and that even if he is guilty of everything he was charged with that the sentence is insane and it was clearly driven by politics - even the judge during her sentencing indicated that part her reasoning was because of his philosophy.
I recommend watching [  . Certainly it is fair to be concerned that it has a pro-Ross biased perspective given the source but much of what is presented seems not only plausible but backed up by hard facts.

Actually, according to the US government, bitcoin is whatever it needs to be in order to maximize apply existing and future laws over the populace. For purposes of taxes, it is a commodity so we get to pay capital gains (see IRS). For purposes of money laundering, it is money (see silk road).
The whole capital gains thing is a giant pain. For a case when I liquidated an amount to spend it, I reported it but for small purchases, I just always make sure to buy new bitcoin at the same time I am spending my other coins in an attempt to create a 'wash sale' so that I don't have to think about the capital gains for now.
Having said that, there is certainly some concern that another interpretation will decide that the wash sale approach is not valid because  it will be interpreted as something else. This does not mean that I am clamoring for more laws for the gov to actually formally decide how they will treat it but it does mean I can partially understand why some in the business world would wrongly choose to do so.

The tumber/mixer does not change anything with respect to your responsibility to report capital gains.
Yes. after you buy goods with btc profit you need to pay tax on the gain.
Capital gains tax rate is not 50% (assuming you are in the US). 
Ordinary dividend and short-term capital gain: Tax rate is same as ordinary income tax rate.

silly. besides, even if this were possible it is pretty clear you'd need to take the double SHA-256 hash for this theory to carry any weight.

How unexpected.  is censorship resistance while is censorship promotion. Really quite Zen.

*** Please Read Carefully***
Since electrum added trezor support I've seen a few posts like this. Lots of smart people provide pretty good answers but most don't realize what the person asking the question is really about to do.
DO NOT import your current trezor wallet into Electrum. The moment you do that, you've lost all of the benefits of having a trezor to start with. Your private keys (which up until that point had been safely inside your trezor only and therefore effectively immune to keyloggers, PC malware, etc) will immediately be just as vulnerable as if you had never had a trezor to start with.
Certainly doing an import like that is a (potentially) reasonable thing to do if you've lost your trezor or it has failed but it is not what the electrum people are talking about when they say they've added Trezor support. What is 'new' is that with the newest version of electrum and the appropriate plug ins, electrum can communicate with the trezor device directly (assuming you've configured it correctly and have the right plugins setup) without the need for the mytrezor website. So, when you want to make a transaction, you'd still use electrum but you'd always plug in your trezor when you wanted to send bitcoin.
So why is the community (generally) happy about electrum trezor support? - Well, before the feature was added, if the trezor company went away and mytrezor went away, you'd have no way to spend coin (sign transactions) in your wallet stored in the trezor without first importing that private key into a wallet on your computer (sort of like what it looks like you are getting ready to do). Not ideal, particularly if one has a very very large number of coins. The new feature means that loss of mytrezor does not force one to lose the security of the trezor device to access they wallet.

How about The Free State Project -

TL;DR - Yes. Close enough.
Software programs are made up of many individual files that describe how the program will work. Given the complexity of keeping track of all of these files, and bugs and mapping them to version numbers, any moderately complex program uses software to help keep track of the state of the project. 
While each of the programs used to keep track of software is somewhat different, most offer the idea of 'tagging' a set of files with a name, number or other label so that you can from that point forward refer to that particular collection of files as a consistent set. When getting ready to release a new version, one of the first steps would be to 'tag' a set of files that you intend to become the release. After this, one would generally then build the software and do some final testing of that configuration of files before considering the released finalized.

Its even worse. The bank lends out that $90 to someone else, that person buys something with the money. The person they buy it from deposits the $90, so now the bank lends out 81 additional dollars - this continues on eventually multiplying the initial deposit substantially.

Most of these people are going $100k into debt to get a degree in art history....so there is that.

It already did.  If you've been following since before it achieved dollar parity, I'd say we mooned a while ago. The question now is when will it Mars.
