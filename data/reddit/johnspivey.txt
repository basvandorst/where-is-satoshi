I normally do too, but it was early in the morning, I hadn't had my coffee and I just had a lapse in judgement.  It's unfortunate that my lapse in judgement cost me dearly.

Not that I am aware of and I don't have any of these programs installed currently.
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:42:14
I agree. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:42:34
Thanks.  I believe the Coinbase will reimburse me, but really appreciate the kindness.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:43:42
Sorry to hear.  I know how you feel.

I don't believe so, but I've never sent bitcoin before.  I literally just had an account opened not too long ago and bought some coins over the last year.

The link and explanation is at the top of the thread.  Additionally, I am in contact with Coinbase and they are on top of it.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:45:49
Many thanks.

So I believe the link re-routed me directly to Coinbase, but installed an API inside coinbase when I logged in that allowed them access and then they transferred the BTC immediately.  The only thing shady was the email, but when I clicked on the link, it took me to Coinbase.com so I thought nothing of it.  I looked at the address bar in the browser to confirm and it looked legit so I followed through.

Never invest more than you can lose is something I would be comfortable with if Bitcoin went to zero.  Having my property stolen from me is something totally separate.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:16:45
This is exactly what happened.

Also, somewhere, there is an Italian scammer reading this thread and laughing.  If you are reading this, I hope you ride your Vespa off a cliff you Italian fuckstick.  Nothing against Italians, just this one in particular.

If anyone is curious what the email looks like, I have taken a screen shot and uploaded to Imgur.
I don't know what to do?
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:16:02
I've tried every way possible to get in touch with Coinbase and they have not responded.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:44:49
Putting it behind me is definitely the toughest part.  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:57:11
This isn't helpful at all dude.  I only use coinbase, I'm obviously not the most sophisticated bitcoin investor and I'm looking for some assistance.  Since it still says the transfer is pending, I was hoping there would be a way to halt the transfer.  Thanks and keep it relevant or go away.

Man, I am such a bonehead.  This is the first time I've fallen for something like this.  I am usually very vigilant.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:10:50
So it looks like I did have 2 step verification enabled for anything over $500 in BTC and I don't remember verifying to have that transaction go forward?
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:56:56
What do you use for this?
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:19:46
This is smart.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:21:28
Losing 6 BTC isn't the end of the world, but it does suck.  Its basically $3-4k that I've invested over the last year and the fact that I can be scammed out of my property with no remedies is why I've been skeptical about BTC to begin with.  I understand the value to the anonymity, but security needs to be easier to understand and not so complex for the layperson.  
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:06:55
I've done this in every way possible and they have not responded.  There is no easy way to contact them.  I've emailed them twice, I've posted to their twitter, and I've sent in a form through their website.  Nothing in response yet.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:29:39
What information do you require Mick?
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:00:41
Yes.  This is exactly what happened.  I followed the link and looked at the address bar and it was coinbase.com.  That's why I thought nothing of it.  I entered in my login/password and then I received a phone SMS code.  When I entered that to login, the first thing I saw was that my BTC was in the process of being transferred.  I disabled the Coinbase Cloud application immediately, but it was too late.

That is where the link leads.

Thank you very much.  I will.
