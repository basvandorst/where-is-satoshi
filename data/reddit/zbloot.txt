This is the boat I have been in. I have been attempting non-stop as their SMS pin seems to be really hit or miss and will only send the key if I try 5-6 times. I know it's not getting backed up, though, as once I receive the PIN I never receive any more. I shot them an e-mail 8 hours ago and have yet to receive a response.. Pretty aggravating.

Not necessarily. I plan to have enough rules in place to keep this from turning into spam. In addition to this I am not certain we would be able to fund the bot enough to spam anything.
EDIT: Imagine that the bot can only perform 10 bitcoin tips / day and each tip MUST be performed in a sub-reddit or post that has not already been tipped in that day. That alone would inhibit spam.

Fair enough. While I don't agree I do understand where you are coming from. Thanks for your input.

Okay. So in no way am I trying to argue with you, but would you consider typical tipping to be spam then? If so then understood.. If not then what would make this bot any different than a "man-backed-bot" making a call to the bitcointip bot?
EDIT: And by this I mean typical bitcointip tipping in a non-bitcoin subreddit

Yep. This wasn't my plan. I want to have certain conditions in place that a user must meet before they could receive a tip. Basically what I would be looking for from the top would be a variety of things that allow us to know that the user actually contributes to reddit.. So: 
1. Account age
2. Karma / amount of posts 
3. Frequented sub-reddits ( looking for someone a LITTLE more techy so that they will understand what to do once receiving the tip. ) 
4. etc. 
The idea just came to me this morning so of course I have some more planning to do.. But I do think that this would be really fun and would help spread the word. Also, just to make it clear I would be utilizing the bitcointip bot to handle the tips.
