Increasing the capacity is becoming more urgent by the day.  
SW can be done with a soft fork, although it would be much cleaner with a hard fork. It is not a contentious hard fork, so there should be no reason not to do it that way. 
We may experience rapid growth and then be forced to react which could actually introduce more risk, then if planned ahead by creating excess capacity before it is needed.

Chinese miners have an unfair advantage of virtually free power to mine that no one seems to mention. Some international miners have figured out a way to remain competitive against the Chinese, although it is not easy. This is supported by the amount of hashing power we currently have in China. 
Keeping the blocksize low will encourage more mining centralization and it will be specific to one country.
What would be interesting is comparing avg. global bandwidth speeds with local energy costs by country.

So basically Greg does not support a hard fork blocksize increase in the short-term (approx. next 12 months) of any size.
Jeff's proposal of a once off conservative increase of 2mb in the next 6 months whilst doing everything else Greg proposes makes more sense to me. Not increasing the block size at all sends the wrong message to the market. Also, there is a lot that can be learned from doing the hardfork.

Planning capacity using averages is a setup for disaster. Proper planning ensures we have the ability to handle peaks in volume without adversely impacting experience. I.e., call centers staff up during peak times to ensure the wait time doesn't get out of control.
Ideally we should come up with a target what is the max acceptable time to wait for a transaction to be accepted into a block and plan against that.
I would argue we are at capacity now.

OB won't charged commission for merchants to sell goods on the platform which will lead to lower prices. eBay charges sellers 10% of the sale price. A merchant could sell a product 5% less on OB than on eBay and have 5% higher margins. Margins are very small in retail, so this is huge. The incentive for the consumer will be lower priced goods than on other market places.

The product prices will be cheaper on OpenBazaar compared to eBay. eBay charges their sellers a basic fee of 10% of sales at a minimum. Even if OB1 charged 2% of sales for their services, that is 8% margin for the seller to play with - most of it will be passed on to the consumer. The VCs are interested in the service fees that most sellers legitimate sellers will op-it for. Lets not forget sellers will have zero payment acceptance cost since the platform is based on bitcoin payments. 
eBay could try to defend by selling similar services as OB1 on the OpenBazaar platform. 
This could be the first killer app for Bitcoin.

"TL;DR:  I propose we work immediately towards the segwit 4MB block
soft-fork which increases capacity and scalability, and recent speedups
and incoming relay improvements make segwit a reasonable risk. BIP9
and segwit will also make further improvements easier and faster to
deploy. We’ll continue to set the stage for non-bandwidth-increase-based
scaling, while building additional tools that would make bandwidth
increases safer long term. Further work will prepare Bitcoin for further
increases, which will become possible when justified, while also providing
the groundwork to make them justifiable."

TPS is okay as a capacity measure for the system, but it does not take into account the user experience.  Tradeblock figures provide some insight, however it assumes a steady demand of transactions over a given time period. Transactions aren't FIFO, so you can't calculate expected wait time using TPS during high volume periods. 
The flaw comes back to peak demands on the system where averages for the month no longer matter. Avg. performance may look good for the month, however there may be instances during the month where transactions peak and the wait time is hours/days. We need to plan for peak demands, so the system can handle it. 
Ideally, we all should agree on a SLA and put a target against it. Something like: X% of transaction are confirmed in Y minutes or less
I.e., 98% of transactions are confirmed 15 minutes or less. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:02:22
Only transactions with the highest fees get through and the rest of transactions are just sidelined until the congestion clears. This doesn't increase the capacity of the network and just encourages people to outbid each other to get processed. 
What are you going to tell the average consumer who tried to pay a merchant, but didn't pay a high enough fee during congestion to get the payment processed? Sorry, you should of paid a higher fee?
@_date: 2015-12-08 01:22:00


Yes, his whole post.
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase)."
So, how long will it take to build and implement the features Greg mentions to reduce the "controversy" of moderate blocksize increases?

no µ just use the simple word bit.
For those recommending anything else you are not thinking about the people who make up the total potential bitcoin market. In emerging markets some people just make over a dollar a day to survive. Telling them 1 bitcoin costs over a year's salary simply will put them off right away. Even if you explain to them they can buy smaller portion of it. 
Second, the education level and intelligence of people vary. We can't expect everyone to understand what .000123 represents. If a poll was conducted with people off the street and you asked them to name the places after the decimal, i.e. one-hundredth - the results would be shocking. Putting a funny symbol µ isn't going to make it any better. Just call it a bit.
We need to make bitcoin future proof and also make it SIMPLE! When a business designs a product/service they design it to the needs and expectations of their target consumers/segments. Who do we want the users of bitcoins to be in the future? If we expect users to be the profile on Reddit, then decimals or µbit is fine. For mass world adoption bitcoin needs to be designed for ease of use that a child can understand and use it.
