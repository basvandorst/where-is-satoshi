Rat Poison is an anticoagulant (aka warfarin). This causes the Rat to become severely anemic and they end up dying through internal hemorrhage. 
You're thinking of insecticide.

It's still funny every time

I see you too have been on twitter

Bitcoin is still over it's mean though. If you look at the big picture, it's been following the same mean average for the past few months and it had that huge spike in between. 
That green line on the bottom is the trend BTC has been following and it hasn't broke it. If we kept going on slow and steady growth, we'd be at the same exact price we are at now.

That's pretty nuts bro
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:16:06
That's exactly what I'm planning to do. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:42:19
I haven't used it yet. Still waiting on verification from them but I'm reading some scary reviews. Do you trade with big amounts? And how is the withdrawal service, that's what I'm worried about.
I don't want to use crypto capital because I hear bad things about it.

Planning on transferring from gdax to cex. Then selling and withdrawing from there. Repeat several times in a month.

Nah I think fiat can't be sent anywhere just the coins
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:02:37
This sub is ridiculous. Every single coin has it's benefits and downsides... like BTC is too fuckin expensive to trade and is too fuckin slow to transfer.
Invest your money in what you believe will do well. And NEVER take advice from this sub about alt coins. I go on several different subs related to cryptocurrency is this is by far the only one that hates on every other altcoin. 
I'm invested in several coins including BTC, ETH, Stratis, LTC, etc. And almost all of them have given me a good profit. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:42:46
Yeah but the price for all the individual ones add up to 1 BTC when you buy or sell
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:04:06
Also cheaper to trade

Which other exchanges would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:03:42
if you want to learn about LTC, go to or this sub sucks for information about other coins

Can you ask them why their response time sucks?
I would ask them myself but I'd end up getting an automated reply after a month and never hear from them again. Maybe you can be their voice for the people of reddit!

I did a lot of research mate! Some end up being scam-like so I like to get the consensus of the users here on what works for them.

How are ETH smart contracts shitty?
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:06:03
You're absolutely wrong about ETH.
dogecoin was made as a meme, ETH is backed by hundreds of companies around the world and has a pretty good development team. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:40:15
The value is in the technology, not the amount of coins available.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:59:02
Do you have an example of such altcoins (serious, would love to study what went wrong with them).
Most altcoins I'm invested in have been here for at least a year and seem to be doing well.
