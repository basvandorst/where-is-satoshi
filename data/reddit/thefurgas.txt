a) easier to aquire but not easier to exchange for giftcard
b) I think that PurseIO is used by buyers mainly because of discounts, not because you pay with bitcoin

Bump. You're right. The [~] was dismissed by my mind, also lack of comma so I guess I treated hours as points. Lol.

I didn't know what are you people talking about until I checked reddit on browser. Points are still visible in 'reddit for fun' Android app.

Maybe they lost the private key and realized that recently...

At the same time Bitpay sells bitcoins someone buys them to use it later. Even counting early adopters IMHO it should be pretty balanced in the long run.
Later we will all be paid in Bitcoins and Bitpay will be obsolete :-)

It is not trustless. What prevents people running the election to use what's left of stockpile at the end of voting?

I was thinking/asking of such thing:
So, it's not currently possible. How difficult would it be to add such "lock time" variant into bitcoin core?
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:51:28
Thanks for explanation. So generally such transactions are generated offline and handed out to someone else for future redeeming. 
I wonder, is there a way to create a transaction that, when included in blockchain, will not let to spend its outputs before certain point in time? Let's say I want to keep certain amount my bitcoins for a year, no matter what.

So, basically it's smartcard and USB smartcard reader combined into one dongle and all processing is done by some applet on smartcard? Will it be possible to make this applet work on JavaCard 2.1.1 smartcards?
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:03:32
Where should we report bugs for this version?
I've noticed:
- "Add New Account" dialog: "Avanced" instead of "Advanced" on the button
- I've made backup of my Master Seed, then reinstalled the app and tried to import it. The import fails with "Unrecognized format" message.

I'm pretty sure Satoshi is no longer alive - accidents and fatal health issues can happen to anyone.
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:40:13


So, what is the purpose to use such transactions? If you have to broadcast it after nlocktime has passed to have it included in blockchain, you can also broadcast it as standard transaction (without nlocktime).
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:47:17
Thanks! I was asking, because the student card personalization center I work for is looking for new use-cases for these smartcards (350 000 issued so far, 40 000 per year). What exactly blocks it from using on Java Card?

Ok, you're right.

Let's assume that I accept Bitcoin at local store without waiting for confirmation (small amounts) and a customer pays by sending transaction without fee. Should I accept that payment?
In other words, will feeless transaction be confirmed eventually or is there a risk that it won't be confirmed? 
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:57:20
But why are they not displayed on "View profile" page? It's only in JSON/XML/etc.
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:38:43
Is there any work in progress on precising 402 Payment Required HTTP status code, like some RFC?
Example flow:  
1. Browser requests the resource.  
2. Server responds with 402 status code, payment options and per-option details.  
3. Browser lets the user choose payment option. Then fires up configured extension/program for payment processing. It returns payment details (bitcoin transaction hash for example).  
4. Browser remembers the pair "resource URI-payment details".  
5. Browser repeats the request for the resource, this time with payment details.  
6. Server validates payment using payment details and return the resource. It can remember payment details and its validation result.  
7. Next time browser requests the resource it can attach remembered payment details.

They don't get it. Bitcoin is anti-government, at least in the current form of government, in which the most basic requirement is money control. Any idea of "govcoin" based on open decentralized blockchain (like bitcoin) is just stupid - it would inevitably lead to centrally controlled electronic money, which we already have.
Global adaptation of bitcoin in its current form would mean total redefinition of government and state. I would like to see an experiment of one global state and government as major initiator and governor of crowdfunded projects where you pledge your support (with bitcoin) for things that you want - all open, accessible and verifiable in global ledger.
That's why governments will do anything to fight bitcoin or at least contain it by controlling its exchange to and from fiat money. That's also why paper money must disappear, because it can't be controlled as easy as electronic money.
Interesting times ahead of us...

Since "JoinDiaspora.com Registrations are closed", how can I follow  on joindiaspora.com from another pod? [This open issue]( suggests that such elementary feature is missing.

The size of the rest of the Fiat Beast is left to your imagination. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:33:47
I really can't understand this block size limit nonsense. The hard limit should be dropped completely. I'm sure that the system will self-balance. It will always be a "fight" between users (number of transactions, fees) and miners (soft limits, hardware investments - including storage and bandwidth and software limitation). 
@_date: 2015-08-07 08:09:19
It wouldn't. Just do it already and see it tune by itself.

I think  should be updated with visually checking (roughly  not exactly) that pasted address is the same as that displayed on backpage, because a malware can replace the pasted address.

The main problem is that Mycelium tells you that there's a new version, and Google Play doesn't have it yet. I also ended up ignoring this update in Mycelium - Google Play will tell me when the update is ready.
I think that this screen/process needs a redesign - either disable the screen altogether if Mycelium is installed from Google Play, or show it only when the update is available in Google Play. If neither is possible, there should be only some notification "current version - newest version" and some explaining regarding Google Play version difference.

I've created a wallet (started on Android, then Chrome). Works great. I've also tested ninki-recover and was able to claim the funds.
I was somewhat surprised when Chrome wanted me to provide the GUID which wasn't even mentioned in Android app, but fortunately I was able to have it sent to my e-mail.
Also, what is this "Validation phrase" thing?
It would be cool if I could add contact by providing e-mail address, and when it's not found, some invitation message is sent to this person with instructions on how to start.
Also, some FAQ would be nice.
How can I contribute a translation?
What are your plans in the long run? Do you have any TODO list?
