Ah that is good to know. Is it due to the anti-bitcoin sentiments with UK banks? 
I was wondering this too. SEPA seems cheaper but I thought that a SWIFT from GBP to EU before wiring it to Kraken (in Luxembourg) would be cheaper. 
I'll find out if I am wrong soon.

Would the fiat be able to be thieved as well, like btcs on my account? 
Whats the difference between keeping fiat vs. btcs on exchanges in terms of risk?
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:07:12
yeah its a pretty slow market over here. Whats up with that?
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:07:00
I definitely didnt do it right the last time but now i know! Thanks for your help

Hello there,
Thanks for all your help.
Its 936739 (Coinbase) and 941801 (GDAX).

Thanks for your reply
I'll definitely reach out to Kraken to see what they say.

I sent you guys an email today. 
Thanks for getting back to me,

If I deposit my coins to GDAX, how do I sell them into fiat? My coinbase account does not have a bank associated with it, so where does the money go?
@_date: 2016-06-03 12:18:15
Wait, so Coinbase wont let you send your coins to another exchange (like Kraken)?
Why is that? Seems... unfair
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:14:12
love the approach -- if all else fails i'll do this. 
with infrastructure come limitations.

Good to hear this is how you think
@_date: 2016-06-03 12:07:40
Hi Rosie,
I'm getting an error that says 'GDAX is not yet available. Please contact GDAX support.'
What should I do?
@_date: 2016-05-29 11:08:50
I have already done so. Thought someone here may have a better solution
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:22:58
Thank you for your reply and please excuse me for my ignorance -- I'm completely unread on how it works in the UK.
 
If I send my coins to Kraken, does that mean that Kraken has a wallet or a temporary holding spot for the coins? 
@_date: 2016-05-29 11:09:27
I havent but I dont think it'll let me move coins to an UK exchange without my account being 'complete'
Either way, would you recommend any good exchanges? I'm thinking about using Kraken

I guess I was surprised to find that Coinbase needed my country of residency... What happens to travelers and people who move a lot who want to sell their coins using coinbase?
