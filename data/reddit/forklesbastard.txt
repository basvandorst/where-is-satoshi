With 6% of all coins you can do serious market manipulation. It takes ~20000 out of that 850,000 BTC to make the market on Bitstamp to make a 33% move (~$200) down.
I feel a little sick thinking about all the thefts to date and how much BTC they have. We don't know how much is on exchanges manipulating price but perhaps this is a factor adding to volatility.
The anonymity of bitcoin can let the computer savy ASPD/psychopaths in. These thefts are only the most rational thing to do if you are ignorant to the enormity of harm they cause people and ecosystems.

An analogy isn't an argument. Remember the big picture outside the price.
Bitcoin is a hedge against corrupt systems and politicians. Folk in Venezuela who bought into Bitcoin saved their wealth from extreme devaluation and confiscation.
Bitcoin is many things, but don't mistake higher-order behaviors like buying coffee on the lightning net as the important thing; Bitcoin is the first and largest trusted trustless-token having the ability to compete with a government's ability to issue tokens such as fiat money and transfers of title.
