@_date: 2016-04-23 18:49:02
But look at number 65 dude! He falls in love with him :) he's a bitcoiner.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:24:34
Lets not do that because new people will continue to use/sign up to coinbase. Nice try coinbase! Get your shit together! Hows the internal investigation going?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:02:20
Futures contracts expire tomorrow. So short 5 btc from $20k and you've made over $10,000,000
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:42:56
I'm about to say "China bans bitcoin". Bitcoin is still technically in a downtrend if you look at the 4h and 6h chart.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:50:11
There was a thread yesterday on where people were going nuts over Raiblock transaction fees/time, it was full of new people seeing how quick the transactions and how low the fees were. But they were comparing it to bitcoin today with 10000x more transaction and users.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:16:15
When will we hear whats happening next? Theres no audit now?...Is tether still being printed?
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:08:50
Yep, I agree. OP what does your history url look like?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:52:49
He related it to bitcoin dominance, which makes no sense. Bitcoin can have a dominance of 1% and still have the largest market cap. Competition is good!  
Edit* competition from competent coin devs is good. Not shit coins.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:05:38
Bitstamp is decent for withdrawing large amounts
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:56:32
THE BATH!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:01:17
Bitcoin is in an uptrend though. These articles are just out to scare my mum.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:24:22
Fucking tether, I blame the exchanges who knew the risks and didn’t listen.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:09:20
It was closer to zero when I was worth $0.1, $1, $100, $1000, $10,000. People who randomly spat a zero valuation clearly know nothing about it. When I told my parents I had invested, they would call it a ponzi, say it would drop to zero etc, but they hadn’t read the white paper, hadn’t looked at the code, nothing. This must just be a default reaction to new tech for naive people. Now they talk about a bit more positively. Also $14k might seem expensive for most of us, but it’s not for some of us.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:57:51
STOP TEMPTING ME! 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:11:07
Use segwit!
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:03:55
I too would be wishing for bitcoin to collapse so I could buy more for what I have, had I not already invested.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:16:50
This is the personification of bitcoin day traders mind. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:51:42
We’re like 17% of the way.

Your dingle.

Thats selling power not exactly a wall, it may well be a wall but thats not what that graph shows.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:51:08
Ahh that's an odd bug, that it continues to be invalid.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:41:33
Wouldnt people buy bitcoin if tether was to crash?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:47:36
because they boast fast and cheap transactions and nothing else, thats all they have over bitcoin and its only because of the low amount of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:45:35
Just missed that dip!!
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:09:03
He made a point that he didnt like Trump...thats a good thing!
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:56:00
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:12:10
Its at an uptrend now...
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:29:15
I sold
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:45:45
Why wouldn't they short again? genuine question.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:17:07
Well technically I bought low and sold high...it just went way higher.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:23:11
Its not dropped that hard!
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:52:03
I'm hoping for it to be the default payment method, it makes sense to do it that way with the option of direct to blockchain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:41:52
But no one will be willing to swap bitcoin for tether. If you have tether and shit hits the fan, say goodbye to it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:56:18
Let me guess, you can though.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:58:33
Well both of it’s going mtGox way.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:43:08
If you're interested in buying this, perhaps I can interest you in some BitConnect coins?
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:42:20
Fuck you NEOBEE
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:57:52
So if I sell it goes up and if I hold it goes down. Fuck, I wish I slept through this one. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:55:13
1/10 people you know, you suspect own bitcoin? You must be a programmer? or network tech?
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:30:33
is leaking
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:23:59
All priced in satoshi which is priced in fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:37:55
I'd use coinomi and import empty private keys
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:50:13
All alts are valued in bitcoin, if you invest in alts and bitcoin goes down in price, so do the alts. 80% of alts are being made redundant thanks to LN anyway, so its very risky.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:17:04
Wall street because of the organisation and manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:57:46
Will LN payments be the default payment method in core?
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:48:49
But you can hold it safely via cold storage or hardware wallet. Banks are hacked all the time and much much more money is stolen from people bank accounts whether it be via the government, hacker or card thief. Heck someone could hack my Paypal and have access to my bank. Bitcoin is great because if you're smart, it's not hackable and 100% safe, but yes I do agree more default security types should be in place such and 2FA!
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:48:43
$8 via segwit or around $20 if not. Pretty good!
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:36:29
Well they're still involved, they will pump it and make money doing it again and again, until its regulated.
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:14:03
Also bitcoin has never been hacked, people have been reckless and have compromised themselves and others but the code or blockchain has never been compromised which we can’t say for banks. I can steal someone’s wallet right now and go on a spending and get some personal info as well.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:59:17
You need to re-read my comment.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:08:54
I see a frog and a cock n balls
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:49:10
I sold at 10450.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:53:53
Segwit is amazing for trading, I hear some new that is going to cause a drop, I deposit via segwit and get my coins on the exchange in 15min at the most, sell then rebut the dip.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:33:06
No I believe it dipped for tax reasons, some withdrawing for the year and now people want to get in early for this year.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:49:41
perhaps on the 1min chart. But I'm seeing higher lows.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:13:46
You should’ve ordered a pizza somehow.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:55:28
I put some on an exchange with the full intention of selling and buying back at a lower price. I watched for about 6 hours and did nothing! 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:17:43
Is there not futures going the other direction that people are trying to push? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:00:05
So would it had been better to have bought bitcoin directly? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:44:13
I have an idle raspberry pi 3, may I have the guide you're following? I've not really used linux so im going to be in the deep end, but I'm not going to learn it unless its for something im passionate about.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:13:38
Its so stupid to ban these things, thats how and why tech like bitcoin get invented. We have tor, we have p2p, vpn, bitcoin and a whole load of other cool shit i dont even know about.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:18:32
No this is designed to keep poor people, poor.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:04:09
They’re playing by using TA, which is basically how the human mind reacts when money is on the line. These guys take money mostly from the layman. They dont have so much of an emotional attachment. If people just bought and sold without any TA, then graphs would be pretty random and all stocks would be super volatile. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:58:24
You still have to risk putting 250btc onto an exchange though, seems risky.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:33:34
It certainly will, making many coins obsolete and rising to 80% dominance. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:31:39
There will be another dip in a couple hours
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:52:26
But if every child could do it then they would all be competing and form their own charts, the smart ones will see patterns inside he patterns and they will be the successful ones.
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:01:05
No it’s not, what about bitstamp?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:16:54
BCH was forked from a certain block/date so any transactions after that wouldn't count. So its the balance you had when it forked which determines the Bcash balance. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:38:24
I couldn't hold bcash for this reason. LN could come out any time and bcash would drop like a hat.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:17:26
Is there a space after the address?
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:28:45

Upgrade was fast but was just left well too late.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:57:49
Yes what happened to that “internal investigation” of theirs?
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:36:53
Well there was no natural price rise, this is a bull trap and will drop to ~$10k in a couple days. Technically it’s still in a downtrend so may have an opportunity to buy at $8k but you would have to be quick! If you buy now or sell now you can make money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:40
Almost certain this is the reason, we can thank the lack of regulation for the highs and lows we will see in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:03:47
Well at least something is up.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:31:38
They also have the greatest development team with many more unofficial developers looking to help. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:08:40


Another nail in the coffin
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:45:47
Agreed. Every bitcoin, $ whatever spent is a small vote. Were harming ourselves using them.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:49:29

@_date: 2018-01-28 20:50:19
Certainly! I was just playing with my plonka, to concentrate on anything but that at 16, takes true dedication.
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:27:29
Also if you want to pay a fee as you do with bank, there will be services which will manage your bitcoin and will provide insurances.

@_date: 2018-01-07 21:02:15
That's because there has been an influx of new users...buying from coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:06:50

Coinbase hasn't even Segwit yet, expect them to be the last to implement LN. 
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:38:50
Roger Ver in disguise.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:05:42
We were 20% of the way there, now currently 12%. If you think in percentages, then $100k isnt that far away. Once LN is the default way in transacting, then it will fucking rocket up.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:46:18
Ver funny.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:55:25
Did bitcoin break? If no, then no.
@_date: 2019-07-20 17:31:01
...LN is scaling Bitcoin. LN is still bitcoin, I don’t get your point. LN is electronic cash as bitcoin is to gold (or fiat in today’s world). We don’t physically pay with fiat/gold when paying the mortgage.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:34:30
Blue bulls are the worst though.
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:24:47
Then don't use bitcoin until it's developed further, or use q r codes to send and receive. Remember the internet started off using just server ip addresses, so you couldn't go to NASA.com you had to put in the ip  address.

@_date: 2019-07-20 15:21:19
You implied instead of asking the questions fairly. There was bias in the question that casts doubt. I do agree with you somewhat, it was a solid question, just asked wrongly. It's not your fault really, just when Bitcoin makes an advancement bcashers like to shit on the parade, even if it's subtle.

Well currently you only pay tax on what you convert to fiat. If taxes were paid via monero, then your taxes could be spent on anything such as funding terrorism and you wouldn’t know it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:42:16
Yes LN will make BCH and 90% of alts irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:24
The price of energy is dropping dramatically and were quickly turning over to renewable energy. Also it's irrelevant when you compare it to the amount of energy used to hold up the banking world.

@_date: 2017-12-25 16:35:39
Because its completely anonymous. Bitcoin in anonamous to a certain extent, but if you were under investigations, funds could be tracked. If we payed taxes in bitcoin you could tell what your money was being spent on, you could make sure it wasn't wasted or funding terrorism, spent by politicians on luxury items , unlike monero. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:43:11

There are many many more people willing to buy now which will help prevent a bubble burst. Theres also many companies who wont let it drop below a certain level.

Can I buy a house with bitcoin and not pay these taxes? 
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:48:44
I can only assume you don't use PayPal, you're half way there! I also assume you support Roger Ver coin and guess what, 1000's of alt coins have cheaper onchain transaction than bitcoin currently, and that's because none have scaled anywhere near the amount transaction bitcoin handles.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:18:12
But it not a better payment system... it has smaller volume hence the smaller transaction fees. Also why would you mention BCH as a better payment system when there is litecoin, monero, gridcoin and a bunch of other coins which are better as a payment system.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:22
London/New York and it could be double that.
@_date: 2018-09-18 11:29:36
Bitcoin charge? What?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:41:06
Litecoin is good but the question is, what does litecoin do better than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:01:33
Once Coinbase is back in, bcc will tank, anyone wanting to buy bcc can from other exchanges, that leaves one outcome when it comes back online.
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:10:57
Facebook wouldn’t need to run LN to make shit loads of money from bitcoin, it could still collect users spending habits using bitcoin. It’s not anonymous if you’re spending bitcoin via a Facebook run platform.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:33:26
I don’t know these numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:33:59
I blinked! fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:04
I also see many articles saying how bitcoin is the new gold. Bitcoin could be the new store of value, dropping the price of gold so we can use gold more freely for science etc with its unique properties.

Segwit need to be made default until LN comes in.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:50
If its mass adoption then its not going to be a bubble, seeing as wall street is getting in then we're just creating a new floor.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:56
It's because of newbies. That would also be my reaction if I was new, "holy shit look at that graph, I know nothing about bitcoin but that is a bubble".
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:58:00
Well we do actually, often via proxies. For example we can see the uk government has recently funded terrorism via supplying weapons to Saudi Arabia. With monero any country or person could fund terrorism directly without the fear of a trail or even a whistleblower.

Well there is the 'help to buy scheme' for first time buyers. I think its only council places though, and the government help pay for up to 50% I believe. So a £62k flat for £32k. You then have to live in it for 5 years, cant rent it out/sell or anything.

@_date: 2017-12-13 08:24:36
Ah shit I think I may be late but I for one am a NO! This is only because BCash is around and people will buy that thinking it’s bitcoin because the price is higher.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:13:51
You don’t spontaneously announce its availability there and then. You set a date so people can prepare and the enable on said date. That would be like me telling your son there is ice cream in the freezer only you started defrosting the freezer last night.

You will also be getting paid in bitcoin, so although some expenses may cost more, money coming in and money held will also increase. A global currency will take 50 years+ to settle on a price as more people come.

Many of those addresses are exchanges.

Lack of adoption, well that is only increasing and it’s looking to replace gold or perhaps have a large share of the market, possibly 50/50. Government making possession illegal won’t work and is impossible to police. Better technology, bitcoin is evolving and keeping up with requirements. I just don’t see it happening.
@_date: 2019-07-10 22:19:53
Well...BCH is still cheaper!!!! Let here is for BCH! Yeaaah!..Yeaah...Ye? *sniffs*

I can see the appeal with the gpu mining, but yeah if you don’t own bitcoin I certainly wouldn’t recommend investing in it.

Could LN not be the default?
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:47:22
But bitcoin is always being further developed. What coin is better than bitcoin? Yeah they may have a unique aspect but that doesn't mean its better. Monero for example, although its great for what its used for, will never have the chance of being a fully fledged currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:31:55
And they certainly don’t manipulate markets.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:35:38
If they sold at $300 for btc, that was when btc was $1k, so they made 0.33btc aka ~$5.5k in today’s value. No too shabby.

What else is there to spend it on?
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:11:05
Well that 10k is going to be useless but your other venture is a good investment.

But everyone can see you received the bitcoin. If there is no proof of postage, then people can see you scammed them.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:58:57
And this is why you sell BCH. That is a ticking time bomb that can drop to pennies any given day in the foreseeable future, as with many alts once LN comes in. Once LN is here, I believe there BTC will hold an 80% dominance. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:06:28
That'll be London then. Yeah fuck that, move to the countryside and buy a decent house with a couple acres for that money.

Most of these coins only increase in $ value as bitcoin increase, while also dropping in btc value... this is why alt investment is hard to win. You should have done just btc.

Why? Many banks offer an incentive to switch, last year I changed 3 times and made about $1k.

Thank you, I thought it was, now I just need to read up on it some more.   
Edit* Actually I'm rather confused. So I traded the loss a few years ago when bitcoin was ~$200, If I was to convert to fiat and pay capitals gains, would I submit the loss on todays value or back when it was worth less?

Wasn't btc about $1k then. So yeah dumping at $300 for 0.333 btc aka ~$6600 today would have been a good move.

Just the fundamentals of bitcoin alone, a global currency without a middleman, that alone shows it's value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:48:43
I held bch but had I sold it for btc, even at the low point I would have made over 8x profit in comparison. Playing in alts is a dangerous game, yeah it may go up in $ value but it needs to go up in btc value or its not been worth it.
@_date: 2018-09-29 08:00:31
Yeah OP can’t read numbers.

What would happen if I put down a tax loss such as this? It makes sense, I mean you could still pay tax on the $2 and also report the loss.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:32:01
But LN can come in at any moment, also Kim.com? Is working on bitcoin cache, something like that, which also manages transactions. Also bcash can suddenly see an increase in transaction fees. There are way too many spontaneous circumstances that could drop bcc like a stone.

It’s not a dictatorship.
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:14:42
Honestly probably not, only wackjobs or the naive accept BCH. Starbucks and Microsoft would have done their research, why accept a coin with no development, falling user base and shady marketing.
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:21:48
Only after 6 confirmations, will I reinvest.

Yeah I didn't get stung bad but it was my first time getting conned and hopefully last.

@_date: 2018-08-19 09:11:40
Once 1 bitcoin is $100k+ then it just makes sense to use Satoshi. E.g. a load of bread is 325sats. A car is 159,999sats. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:46:05
But if bitcoin dropped you could have owed rent and £1000. He would want them both, so it wouldn't be a situation in which you could wait for bitcoin to rise again. You would have to sell at a loss, give him his rent and still make up the £1000. The landlord is even more of an idiot for lending £1k to someone who owes him money and says they will invest it for them. Why lend someone who's bad with money £1k! You could also have been kicked out. You also mention you have over £1k in crypto funds so why not make the £50 with your own money. "Experiment" my arse! This is reckless behaviour and a bit of luck and that's it.
@_date: 2018-08-25 13:26:22
Unless you're dealing within the lightning network in which 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000.0000 satoshi. Satoshi have 3 decimal places within lightning network. Only once a channel is closed, will the number be rounded to the nearest satoshi and submitted to the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:31:45
Yes always.
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:28:24
You've had plenty of opportunities to buy for 5k, yet haven't. Not you per se but I see people posting this a lot and what I think happens is that when their purchase price comes, they don't buy, expecting it to drop more. Then the see the price rise and think 'it will come back down', if/when it does, the process repeats itself. If you're one of these people, you need to dollar cost average. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:26:24

Most people sold their bch for btc. Some bought in the hopes of selling higher, or people ended up holding the bags aka Bitman. Rarely did anyone not already holding bitcoin buy bcash. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:35:32
They will have to sell it, the sooner the better for them.

This is why holding alts is risky business, bitcoin has so many more talented people working to improve it, much more investment and it can easily make other coins obsolete.

I hope it is, just for those idiots looking for him. How anticlimactic it would be.
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:07:45
You guys don’t even have segwit or LN. How are you going to do cheap and fast transaction. The fees of bcash are already outrageous and you don’t even have that much of a transaction volume. You’re also centralised and once your ceo bails or LN is fully stable, it will plummet. You’re holding the next bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:22:44
They're not so bad anymore, ive posted a few home truths and haven't been banned.
@_date: 2018-08-17 20:37:17
So that address has received bitcoin but not sent any when checking the Blockchain and it's also says 0 bitcoin when checking the Blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-03 08:08:21
Well you need to factor in if it's worth getting a hardware wallet. I don't want new guys thinking they need a hardware wallet to protect small amounts. Blockchain.info is great for small amounts.
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:03:19
Daily reminder, you can spend bitcoin and buy it back. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:25:48
Well said! Pretty sure many in bch subs are old buttcoiners.

“given that transaction fees sometimes skyrocket to the tune of anywhere from a few bucks to dozens and the average amount of time needed to process a transaction was anywhere from about 15 or 16 minutes to over 30 in the last 30 days.” - oh, I wonder how much their app is costing them, when they could just accept LN payments. Bitcoin evolves a bit too quickly for businesses to keep up.
@_date: 2018-05-13 07:38:46
The important thing is you have your share and more. If bitcoin is going to be what we expect it to be, then you're going to be financial independent.

I think we want to be encouraging spending bitcoins. The lower the fee the better and the more transactions the better. We've got sub blockchains coming soon. The blockchain getting bigger only spurs development to make it easier to use. Especially when the blockchain will be used for stuff other than logging bitcoin spending.

@_date: 2014-06-11 08:57:20
Yes there will be a bubble as people rush to buy. People will be able to see at much higher margins, then it will settle. Might yoyo a bit so he is right in a way.

Ah fair enough, I only looked into TA recently. I have no doubt there are some good ones to follow, but that's a gamble in itself.

Only had £50 at the time. Was pretty much all I had.

Been riding these waves since $2, pretty sure it will go back up.
*edit, Didn't realise or grasp exactly what bitcoin was back then, just saw it drop from $30 to $2 for no reason so bought. Just thought I might add that.

Bitcoin and gold can't really be compared. They're both unique and rare and that's what gives them value. If bitcoin went up, gold wouldn't drop. If bitcoin became a store of value, gold wouldn't drop. Only reason gold would drop, would be if it became abundant.

Then you can say that with any fluctuating price. It not worth it now but it was then and probably will be again. It’s wrong now but if it was to go to $40k it wouldn’t. You can’t tell what the price will be a week down the road, so no matter what time you buy bitcoin, it will always be speculative. Edit also my comment was predicting bitcoin will one day reach $40k
@_date: 2017-01-18 09:22:27

After seeing 1000's of coins say how much better they are than bitcoin, compete and fail. I see no reason why another crypto coin would be able to replace bitcoin, especially since bitcoin has the most/best developers, is heavily relied on and can simply adapt any unique selling points an alt coin has to offer. They would have to come up with something better than blockchain tech.

addresses dont mess up, its hard coded. Addresses are generate by hashing a public key, with ripemd160 hash after a sha256 hash on the public key. A company offering to manage addresses would get laughed at and it would be an obvious scam. I dont understand why you would think bitcoin and/or blockchain is great if you didnt understand that, because if unique, accurate addresses couldn't be formed, then there is no point for either.

Perhaps there may be a company that would be hold encrypted private keys, but I dont see why anyone would use a bitcoin bank to issue and receive payments while taking a percentage, because you can send and receive yourself easily and as long as you have various backups then you're safe. You dont need to manage addresses yourself, they're automatically generated.

Ok so bitcoin could reach $100,000. I know it might seem silly, but then again there is nothing in the way from preventing that happening. We're getting close to 10% there and once it reaches $10,000 then a whole bunch of new money will come flooding in.

That’s why LN is needed, blockchain for store and LN for day to day transactions. Any coin is susceptible to this, yes you can increase the block size but even then you’re susceptible to high fees once demand catches up. Also, and more importantly, it would then be centralised as hardware requirements rise drastically and your average joe can’t run a node.

But instant digital money can do things current digital money via cards can’t. E.g. there will be apps say for a strip club (first thing that comes to mind), with buttons and Satoshi amounts you want to donate. You can then select a button, let’s say ‘spread’, flick your finger in the direction of the girl you like and bam her tassels light up and point at you, she turns towards you and performs the action you requested. Obviously this is a pretty inane example, it’s late and I’m horny, but you get the idea of how instant digital payments will provide instant, tailored and sophisticated results.

If you've not discovered cashback sites already you're in for a treat, here is a description:
When a customer makes a purchase online, instead of visiting the retailer directly, they may choose to go via a cashback website in order to generate a monetary reward for buying the products or services. The cashback website will receive a commission from the retailer and once the purchase, free trial, or information request is confirmed, that commission will be shared with the customer who made the purchase. This means that the cashback site makes a profit on the sale, free trial or information request and the consumer gets to recoup some of the initial outlay back or if they had a free trial or information request earn some money from it.

Lightning network caters for an additional 4 decimal places, so 1btc = 1.00000000.0000 satoshi. This certainly makes up for all the lost coin if you're worried there isn't enough satoshi for a global currecy, not that lost coins were a problem anyway but I understand your concern.

That mentality is just dangerous, I always assume scam/ponzi first until proven otherwise. The whole BitConnect thing was obvious and it’s scary how easy it is to warp a certain type of person, it’s not even like they were brainwashed which everyone is susceptible to, you just have to provide false hope and ridiculous claims.

@_date: 2018-03-26 21:12:10
Well you have purposely left out that, there was an attack on the bitcoin network to raise the transaction costs and that since the attack Segwit adoption is up, this includes exchanges! You also didnt mention batch transaction adoption which has dramatically reduced the mempool, especially with exchanges (coinbase! in particular) adopting that technique. Although bitcoin isn't bullet proof to such an attack again, it is now 2x/3x as hard to do. Bitcoin has evolved since then and its evolving very quickly, especially with fully fledged LN on the horizon.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:27:00
I did say segwit, I also commented under saying about batch transactions as well. Segwit adoption still plays a part and will play a bigger part in the near future.   
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:25:10
It really is exciting, once tether is out of the way all we have to do is work on adoption. Bitcoin is a perfect working project now, for what I know anyway, is there any further improvements to be made? Other than aesthetics.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:35:00
There's another fork? Free money is free money but damn! So we have bitcoin, Bitcoin cash and now 2x?

This makes me feel not so bad about selling the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:30:16
But there is no value in those coins/stocks. There is value in its value. If you're a busy person and haven't time to follow bitcoin but have a jist of what it is, then its perfectly reasonable to see it as a gamble, and there is no problem in investing in a gamble, so long as you dont risk more than you can afford to lose. Only reason I say its a gamble is from a naive investor point of view, which most of us were/are and you can say this about most individual investors in general.
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:58:21
I don't know, going on past results, anyone who did such a thing is much wealthier now so long as they didn't panic sell.

@_date: 2017-10-21 09:34:56
Supply and demand is pretty much what drive anythings value. If $6000 seems ridiculous to you, it's probably because $6000 is relatively expensive to *you* even me, I'm not trying to be a dick (also thats for a whole bitcoin). I just know that something expensive for me, isn't expensive for someone else. I also know people far more intelligent than me who believe in bitcoin and completely understand it, and regularly invest, so I copy them and this doesn't go for just bitcoin. Big companies may be hesitant on accepting bitcoin because yes they're putting the company on the line and peoples jobs which is irresponsible. Once the price settles again, they will accept it. Companies dont invest in bitcoin, they take payments to pay it's employees. Although less companies are taking payment, people are paying each other, especially in places like Venezuela. There has also been huge leaps in the tech recently which has brought in more people.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:41:03
I wouldn't be surprised if Roger (The leader) organised his own attack on the bcash chain to simulate higher transaction volume. They cant even implement Segwit or LN, it will be the next BitConnect crash.

@_date: 2017-10-22 19:29:27
Because they haven't been developed to the extent bitcoin has. There is much less trust. Many of these coins, if they became as popular they would charge higher fees to confirm transaction.

Bah I'll say it, I like Mcaffe, he's fricking cool and eccentric and makes the world a crazier place. I don't blame him for fooling suckers, many of whom would buy into his tweets knowing full well what he's up to just to be first and make ROI. Its always a gamble with crypto and people are responsible for their own actions.

Yeah but if he sold at $30 for it to continue increasing he would sell himself short, yeah make a few bob but would be out of the bitcoin game.

So if there is going to be 21,000,000 you own about 0.00038% of the bitcoin currency. I guess that's a high amount if bitcoin does become more recognised.

All bitcoin has to do is increase the block size limit Like BCH, and BCH is gone, but we don’t need to, that is lazy and we will only need to increase again as bitcoin grows. So develop around the crux, making the crux a non issue.

But it’s a global currency, unless all currencies become obsolete, it will have a value based on other currencies. E.g. £1 = $0.80. I want bitcoin to stand side by side fiat, or a step ahead, I don’t expect fiat to disappear, nor do I want it to.

So to get these BCC, I need to import my private keys into some shady wallet software? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:05:58
If you're waiting on buying and thinking it will drop to $1500 to buy; that is more of a gamble then just buying. Yeah it may drop but support has been built around $1550-$1650 so I cant see it dropping quite to $1500. If you buy now, you will be up either way by the end of the year. If you're wait for a magic number, you may never buy and think, 'damn I wish I bought at $1700.'
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:29:17
I know in the end I will sell for useless $. I'm shit at trading. Buy high Sell Low :(
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:21:36
There are also many more businesses involved in bitcoin with investors who won't let it drop such an amount.

So you mean 'Pakistani'.  "Paki acquired offensive connotations in the 1960s when used by British tabloids to refer to subjects of former colony states in a derogatory and racist manner. In modern British usage "Paki" is typically a derogatory label used for all South Asians, including Indians, Afghans and Bangladeshis."

This is just another jump towards acceptance but it is still far off, it's not in the mainstream news much still. Most people still haven't even heard of bitcoin and as the price increases the urge to sell increases. There are people out there who can single handedly crash the bitcoin market with a huge sell order/panic selling. I have no doubt you will make a profit in the long run but you might want to think about your buy in price.

I think that’s what many of us has learned here. If you’re a hodler through the last bull run, you’re now prepared for the next bull run.

Perhaps as it's the rumour but if it happens this is going to make bitcoin plummet. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 16:36:06
but seriously your bitcoin address is showing!!! 
oh yeah.

You have to remember it’s a portion of collage kids, most don’t give a shit because they’re not the investing type, yet or ever. The investing type, will be interested in bitcoin.

Sorry to say but quite a few are no longer with us. Imagine you were a buttcoiner from the days 1 bitcoin was worth less than $100 and you mocked it and mocked it only for it to pop up, hit $20k and shit in your eyes.

Great for Mass Selling your own digital work, to tippers. e.g. Photo's, ebooks, etc.
This service relies completely on trust. So it is not recommended to buy any physical goods that need posting or anything of real value. I (deadleg22) am willing to escrow for free.
Check the seller history to get an idea of trustworthiness. Reputable sellers will have the flair "Verified Seller" after 3 successful sales (same product or not).
NSFW where appropriate. If you're selling NSFW pics of yourself, you must verify yourself. 1 pic of you with 'Your Username' + "somewhere in the picture. You can then send tippers galleries.

Yet china still seems to be buying most of the bitcoin. 6 months time they will flip flop after getting all this bitcoin cheap. Not only do they have the most gold and money but now bitcoin.

I started my computer because I thought it was crashing -$100+ by the time I got myself set up, it's back up! Fuck predicting this market, it's all guess work short term, you need to trade long term.
@_date: 2013-07-05 08:01:10
Ahh man I was in the same situation but with £5000 savings. I probably wouldn't have invested all 5k but at least 1.5k at $2. Aaaand now I feel sick again. At least I got £50 worth.
It probably your age as to the reason they didn't let you invest and the whole bitcoin concept, probably just went over their heads. Mine anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-26 08:37:33
Then you'll love Somalia! But seriously this is the embarrassing part about bitcoiners. Bitcoin is great as its decentralised and such and yes we don't need the government intervening in our savings and having their say on our money but bitcoin also attracts the 'tinfoil hat' brigade which just makes bitcoin look like its for paranoid androids.

I would have too much bitcoin if it rose to that price. I wouldn't know what to do with it, well where to start and who to help. I guess we could get shit done ourselves.

I always assume if I've heard of it, it's too late to invest. Did you know about 3D printing before the general public? God I know pretty much nothing about investing. Do you invest in the people who created the technology or the people who you think are going to best sell the tech? Sorry if that's such a noob question.
