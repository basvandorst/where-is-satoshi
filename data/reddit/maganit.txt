Go to localbitcoins. That way you can buy through person to person trades instead of relying on one corrupt exchange.

Never knew that. Thanks for letting me know.

Coinbase isn't more secure than any other exchange. As long as it is online, it is vulnerable to hacking. That's what happened with mtgox. Moving to an offline wallet like trezor takes away the hacking risk.

Sell, op. If you have to ask that question, sell immediately. Shame.

Interesting. I can't remember the last time I bought a DVD, but will do. I don't want to write the seed down because my handwriting sucks ass.. Thanks for the advice.

Which password manager do you recommend? I'm kinda wary of having all my passwords stored in one place.

Alright, I'll look around then. Thanks for the advice!

This shit is exactly why I transfer to cold storage after buying

Fuck this spam.

PSA for new lurkers: Get off online wallets. Move to something else, like a desktop or hardware wallet. Google them for more info. Don't rely on exchanges ever again.

I'm not, but regardless, fuck spam and fuck you for spamming.

It literally went up $8 in -10 minutes. Holy shit.

Dude, fuck off with your fearmongering.

Why do people keep posting such a dumbass question?

Lol, if you're panicking then please sell. Cheaper coins for the rest of us.
