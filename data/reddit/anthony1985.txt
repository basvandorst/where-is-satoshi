Well i really Hope so, I bought litecoin when they were 2$ and never sold any of them.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:05:21
It's more exposure for Litecoin,more people know about it better it is,and let's don't forget that btcchina is huge.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:51:15
I agree with this!

@_date: 2019-02-10 14:35:22

@_date: 2013-11-09 11:57:41
This is a sick news . . seems like Litecoin is meant to be worth way more.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:06:05
@_date: 2013-11-09 11:57:16
No he means that the creator of Bitcoin China and the creator of Litecon are brothers. The creator of litecoin also works for Coinbase! another plus for Litecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:01:44
That's great . . so now chinese can buy again 
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:03:27
This is already been used by fxbtc,they never stopt the deposits and kept goin on.
In any case this this great,now Chinese people can buy again btc
