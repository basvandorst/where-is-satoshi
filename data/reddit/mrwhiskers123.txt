SCAM lost like .1 btc to this shit they paid me at first then stopped, was my own fault but be wary

What made them valuable (when they used big rocks with holes) was the size and the past ownership, they didnt actually exchange rocks most the time, I assume it was similar for seashells where the ownership and history as well as rarity was the most important, not so much just the seashell itself

its a scam but im sure you know that shill

They make the comparison to the gold standard, havent read much about seashells only rocks lol.

That would be amazing, bitcoins would be perfect for that, sending them across huge expanses of space.
