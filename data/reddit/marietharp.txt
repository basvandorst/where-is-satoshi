We in the US are motivated to hodl for a year or more in order to be taxed as a long term gain (much lower tax rate than a shorter hold). In December I withdrew $1 from coinbase back to my bank account just to make sure it worked (it was fine) so I'm curious to see if coinbase sends me some kind of 2017 tax reporting doc.

Episode 1 came out when I first realized youtube had crypto related content and so it was an early first impression of the community personality - aside from freaking out about prices. I love it, mainstream investing communities would never make anything so silly. Homage to every anime ever.

Some stocks are crypto plays, like AMD who makes chips needed for mining.  But usually the closest you can get in a 401k to a specific stock is a tech-focused mutual fund which dilutes your exposure quite a lot.  You could look over Fidelity's various allocation options and see if anything looks promising in the [Information Technology Sector]( they look more focused than what my retirement co offers.

Bot or not, it does lead to a real article.  I suppose the bot was tasked with promoting the [CME futures simulation site]( on the relevant subreddits.  It was posted to several.  Futures trading doesn't interest me personally.  I suppose it is a good vehicle for people coming from the futures trading world who will find it a comfortable way of interacting with bitcoin.

Youtube has a bunch of technical analyses from people studying daily price activity.  They are interesting, but the underlying fundamentals I think are more important.  You have to believe the price isn't just going to rattle around, you have to believe the price has a serious reason to go on an upward trend to buy.  Only put in as much as you are willing to lose.

Thank you for posting. I remember those days, the Internet was very messy but also was clearly very useful. The first time I saw the world wide web was in a graduate class at Indiana University in 1994. I thought it was stupid. 24 people all trying to load the Louvre Museum website at the same time paralyzed their server. I thought text-based gopher was just fine and would be the way of the future. The thought of upgrading every necessary Internet connection and backbone between us and them to deliver graphic-rich pages seemed impossible. 
I do believe private home delivery of embarassing media content played a role in mass adoption and higher speed connections. So what aspect of cryptocurrencies serves people's base desires? Gambling maybe.

They have all that geothermal energy. People all get nearly free heat, and hardly a dad ever yells 'shut the door, we're not trying to heat the whole neighborhood!' Fun quote from [a 2011 article](   " they could produce electricity galore but what would they do with the stuff?"

What really surprises me about the secrecy around Satoshi Nakamoto is that he knew up front it was important to develop an impregnable alias.  At the time of the whitepaper it was just an idea that could very well have gone nowhere.  There should be a pre October 2008 trail of someone noisily bouncing proto-ideas around developer circles.  But there isn't much, Nakamoto had his secrecy plan in place well beforehand.  Who has that much foresight?  Somehow he knew that identity would lead to nuthin' but trouble.
The quality of writing in the whitepaper is top notch academic writing (except no citations to prior foundational works) with complete and utter command of the English language.  Nary a funny verb tense or misused preposition to be seen.
