Thank you for supporting the community at large!  I too am a full node and wish I could do more to help.  Since mining is no longer profitable for me (doesn't keep up with electricity cost) I am stuck being a full node.  For now.

Mining hardware cost should reflect the expected return.  30k for 1000ghash is $30/ghash. Each ghash will net you About .0002btc per day (at current difficulty) resulting in About 6 months of mining until breaking even(unrealistic due to difficulty increases.)
This is a do not buy.

Probably. But it still might be cheaper and faster to fly it there than bank transfer.

Who cares what a bank thinks about a currency it cannot control?

Never brush aside a good idea regardless of the source. I agree completely.

Redditor for 2 months.  Sure.  yeah.  this is totally not someone on a PR team.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:03:08
Tis a bank.  For bitcoin.  So all the regulation we despise rolled into one PR nightmare for this sub.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:23:54
This is not how you bet things. If you think bitcoin is better, you put up brk-a and the opponent puts up btc.

Why can you not use bitcoin already?

There was a point where he could have filed for ownership and not have it be used against him as evidence. They did not do that.

Keep those prices low and the stock high!

what reason for rejection was given?

The network accounts for .3% of the overall network. At .03 x 25 x 6 btc / hr this network gets over $2000 us/ hour.

Thank you. $200/hr
@_date: 2014-05-17 14:41:05
First thought I had as well.

That's the value of one bitcoin if we were to generate as much wealth as the US govt. prints in cash over the next 110 years.
