Land of the free, huh?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:17:48
Just surprised and I didn't know that until now.

Was thinking the same, so I guess not so stupid after all (in theory). But hopefully the machine owners have built in some kind of kill switch.

But how do I get those coins? In my mind, I would have to transfer my BTC from my hardware wallet to an exchange first to get the forked coins, right? But then the original BTC are lost or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:22:37
Ah yeah... ELI5 please.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:09:04
You know nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:13:41
You're kidding, right?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:25:32
I think I'm gonna have to throw up...
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:22:03
Not from the US so that doesn't bother me.

Weird uncle: "Guys, have you heard about this interesting digital currency that had enourmous gains in the past few weeks? What was the name again?".  
  
You: "Yeah, you mean the one I kept talking about the last years. It's called Bitcoin--"  
  
Uncle: "Bitcoin Cash! That's the one!"  
  
You: facepalm

Ok, so theoretically speaking, can I still claim my BCH/BTG without interfering with the BTC/BCH/BTG chain?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:20:17
But when I transfer my BTC from my hardware wallet, I only transfer BTC so I still don't get it.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:04:31
No, some just seem like Magic Mikes

So, you're confused about my ELI5 question? Kinda meta :D
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:36:34
What we need are a million threads about Ether!
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:57:25
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 0.1 BTC in every year.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:03:58
But that's not the same as 2X, right? (Noob here)
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:38:05
So the yellow one is the real one which means according to your image Shitcoin Cash is the real one...?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:28:58
$100000 - What's that currency symbol?
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:08:46
Please explain everything in gaming metaphors. Would be a new youtube niche :D
