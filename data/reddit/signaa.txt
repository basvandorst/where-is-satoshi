I just like making bitcoiners look bad. It's actually working too.
Most of you are actually complete retards with no grasp of reality, the rest, well, they are mostly criminals taking advantage of you.

People that do need them never get them, and usually get downvoted to shit. They are the ones who get to see the true face of this society. 
Only the people that don't need them ever get tipped. I think I got tipped like $2 just because I said coocoo my booboo... 
But the last time I got scammed or robbed, it's like everyone joins in unison: "Tough shit! Have all our downvotes you fucking LIAR!!!" 
Honestly, All you have to do is say you are a preteen/teen, and come up with a kind of long story, with way too many details, and have post history. Acting like a female works too, especially if you target the white knight types, they are all gullible as fuck!

one of the reasons for not doing it is the mining fees. People will then realize how "NON-Free" bitcoin really is when they are paying 5000+ bits to move $1. To which won't even matter until 126 years from now.
Until then Bitcoin TX could be 100% free, but they are sticking to something that won't even be needed, until 126 years from now.

I admit, I did forget about you guys. 
I should add that above but don't really feel like editing it. You guys might be the most dangerous of all. 
You guys are full-on delusional ones, "who bring the prey to the predators." 
The gazelles who feed the lions and tigers, through offering them your weak.
So many people have lost fortunes due to your kind.

Yup, put your money where your mouth is, Buy High, Sell low!
I'm a naysayer, but I do believe in bitcoin's protocol. IMO the core devs need a thorough house cleaning and proper direction, as the people in it and around bitcoin... Are mostly scammers, thieves and criminals, using it to pull off rather large crimes. AFAICT, only a few are upstanding, decent people.
So I won't tell my rich friends about it. They are already rich, so they don't need it. Besides, I know way too much about how this "community" operates, to ever recommend it to anyone who I didn't want to scam...
Only reason I would ever tell my rich friends about it, would be to leverage against it, and milk it for every last penny.

3-5M? You can't be serious. Do you really think bitcoin has 3-5 Million users? I wouldn't go further than 200K absolute max.
