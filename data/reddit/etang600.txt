Serious question . Why could anyone use bitfinex again other that to get there remaining coins out ?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:15:08
This doesn't answer any question ?
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:21:29
Realistically, transaction times are too slow for it ( and many other Cryptos ) to be used as an everyday currency unless you use it off chain .
@_date: 2015-12-08 13:33:19
not mine
@_date: 2015-12-12 01:53:07
Well, there is really no point of using bitcoin( mainly the shift card), or any crypto if you have to pay capital gains. Just use gyft at that point .
@_date: 2015-12-12 01:26:49
What if you just call it a loan ? Like someone loaned you bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-08 13:31:36
Someone pointed me at this. It's about cryptsy .
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:31:10
Yes, but in my case I made a few quick trades and tried to w/d my bitcoins and it was stuck in Cryptsy limbo for a couple days .So, I had them release my BTC so I could trade for vertcoin so I could get my coins the hell outta there . 
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:26:02
Why are you holding coins in an exchange?
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:26:32
What I did was contact support and have them "release" my bitcoins ( it was stuck in transfer limbo  for a few days ) then I traded for other coins so I could get something out. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:56:39
Cryptsy has been down since November 24 , and bitcoin transactions have been halted since weeks before that. I had to buy a crap load of vertcoin to get my money out . Soon after i got my coin's out they took all wallets offline since people figured out they could do the same . Word on the street is they got hacked and lost everyone's bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:57:20
Can someone explain to me how this is different from coinbase ?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:54:32
I was thinking the same thing . 
@_date: 2014-04-25 12:18:31
Asics aren't dual purpose .
@_date: 2014-04-24 11:02:22
This is why altcoins like vertcoin exist.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:16:13
The argument is that asics can make a coin stronger since more people will be mining it, but it also commercializes the coin which causes problems like the one in the OP and many others .
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:13:21
Ok, but it wasn't propaganda. These asics that everyone are bitching about are basically plug and play, which takes most of the technical know-how and fun out of mining. Now I have to buy a $10,000 asic just to compete ,and with everyone doing the same I won't reach ROI for a year, if not more. This continues , and every time people complain. Litecoin is going the same way.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:38:53
So vertcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:30:06
It depends on how many goats you sacrifice.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:01:15
is getting spanned too. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:24:07
Seriously , what have they developed ? 
@_date: 2016-01-10 04:02:22
I wonder if people with get audited for not paying capital gains when using this ?
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:10:48
Screw Cryptsy, I hope they get prosecuted to the full extent of the law . I sold alts that I had to buy back at a loss to get my something out , yet they kept taking deposits knowing that they weren't going to let btc out . They just kept making issues up so people would keep using the exchange so they could minimise their loss while screwing over other people . Cryptsy had nearly 3 months to come clean , but they just kept lying about what was happening. I would like to see them explain it in court ..
@_date: 2016-06-26 03:14:39
I agree, something like that would have to be implemented for BTC to become mainstream, but more so near instant transactions . It's not realistic to use btc for everyday purchases when confirmation times take as long as they do .
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:36:45
Bitcoin will never hard fork . Too many people would lose their minds . 
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:36:40
I know there are other wallets , but I used to using the core 
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:47:17
No, my other core wallets didn't have any issues syncing up, so it's not a hardware issue . Looks like it's a bug or problem with the bitcoin core wallet 
@_date: 2016-06-29 15:58:47
Ask Big Vern from cryptsy . He'll tell you
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:34:43
I ran hardware checks and no issues. I have other coins core wallets on the same ssd without any issues .. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:30:30
My search came up with you saying the same thing , so I ran some checks and I can safely say it's not a hardware issue .
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:30:58
They started making mining focused gpu's without diplay ports .
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:31:45
You've never heard of Vertcoin then .
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:39:43
Us at vertcoin are in pre release. I don't see anything holding us back once testing done .
@_date: 2016-12-14 17:24:43
Why would it be a hardfork if the donation script is changed ?
@_date: 2016-12-16 12:42:58
Change the donation address. I figured it out 
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:47:29
Renting hashing power doesn't work that way .
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:40:03
You think that means mining power only costs $2800?
@_date: 2017-04-22 01:20:45
Show your maths 
@_date: 2017-04-22 02:00:59
They would be selling it at a loss 
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:17:52
Vtc has been moving up slowly the past couple months . 
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:45:51
The market cap is over $3.5 million. You obviously haven't done any research 
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:17:50
This happens to me all the time . It makes you wonder how people think bitcoin can be a viable currency with shit like this happening . Well, 2017 isn't that far away .
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:45:55
Everything is wrong about this post . Shame on you . 
@_date: 2017-04-10 14:50:30
What kind of hotdog stands you dealing with ? Does it bother you when funds for through in less than an hour ?
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:05:19
You've just described every cryptocurrency. BTC just went from $1300 to around $900 and now almost back to $1300 . Your logic doesn't add up . 
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:51:00
Where do you get a $80,000 Snickers bar ? 
@_date: 2017-04-10 12:20:48
Why is it useless? It's great for micro-transactions, and also regular transactions. No civil war either. 
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:39:27
I wish I would have seen this before I tried to w/d 2btc yesterday. I've sent a couple emails telling them to cancel the transaction so I can buy any other coin so I can get my money out . It seems that others in the troll box have been waiting 5days and more . You'd think they would make an announcement rather than have it be a surprise. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:26:35
What ?
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:57:40
No not really, by the time the transfer confirmed the price could more or less . 
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:23:34
Smart contracts seem like a good idea . 
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:24:43
Have you ever seen the show silicon valley? Ethereum is like the pied piper platform they built on the show.  It's a great idea and works well ( minus the hack) , but people without a CS degree arent going to know what to do with it. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 20:38:05
Why do you think that ?
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:41:30
crowdfunding 
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:10:40
With asics ,the manufacturers , or the wealthy have you by the balls . It's well known that most sell asics are "tested " for quite some time before they are sold . Anyone can buy gpu's  and as many as you want when you want . 
@_date: 2016-07-06 13:25:08
Most of it , but you have to know a lot to build or use most of the platform . I wouldn't know where to begin . 
@_date: 2016-07-18 12:29:57
I first discovered bitcoin when you was under $10 i think. The only way that I knew to buy it was to send some guy in Australia a money order and he would send you the coins when he got it. I thought that was pretty sketchy and passed.  
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:54:51
What ever happened to paycoin ?
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:06:25
They take bitcoin donations !
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:20:04
I used to trade there quite often. I was selling alts for BTC when they wouldn't let BTC withdrawals happen, so i had to trade my BTC for alts again get to get something out. I ended up losing a little, but at least I was able to get everything out. A few days after all this happened they locked all the wallets.
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:24:12
What, doesn't work in the US? !
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:27:54
Did it die with Cryptsy?
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:26:39
I think they leaked or had a breach with my credit card info. I have a specific card I only use for coinbase instant buys , nothing else ever, and last night I got a fraud alert that someeone was trying to buy party supplies in cali with that card . I don't live anywhere near cali.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:58:08
I was thinking of the credit card
@_date: 2016-07-19 12:07:08
GAW Miners seems to be gone too 
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:29:05
We implemented it on vertcoin . It was set for May 31st but we never ended up needing it . So far so good .
@_date: 2016-07-22 10:47:42
Bitcoin is like every Cryptos big brother or uncle , and Everytime someone posts something along the lines of bitcoin is better because of a, b and c or that would never happen because we are bitcoin is the same as getting banged by your uncle . 
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:15:18
Yes 
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:59:52
When litecoin was minable using gpu's certain areas that powered by hydro electric power was very sought after since electric was nearly half the cost of everywhere else, but that was when mining was very profitable( i had 66 gpu's and was making over $100 a day profit) . Now small to medium size farms(asic farms)  won't make ROI for almost a year depending on the market ( if you hold and sell when the price spikes, or sell right away to cover costs) . I've been around since before bitcoin spiked ( before the first halving) and I can say that asics have totally fucked mining for everyone. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:45:03
Money is the difference. Most will not pre order a 2 th/s miner from a new asic company hoping they will ship, and when(if) they ship if it'll still be profitable to mine with it, or if the miner will work ( knc) . My point is you can't get into mining btc with less than $1000 now . The network is supposed to be decentralized, but a few miners control the entire network .So, if btc was gpu minable it would be more spread out since everyone with a pc could mine it .
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:42:29
It changes in that anyone can purchase a gpu, but to get it costs a pretty to  purchase an asic that will eventually become a paper weight
