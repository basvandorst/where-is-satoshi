I watched the whole video but I couldn't find the part where he said that.
@_date: 2017-01-07 22:17:04
Jonas Schnelli said SPV won't be in 0.14.
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:57:45
It's not about courage or investments for me, but survival.
Banks never gave a damn about me or my business (never accepted me as their customer), so now I only work remotely and receive my payments with bitcoin, which helps me to support my family.
I can't stress enough how important Bitcoin is to me.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:17:52
I mean, it will be interesting to compare this to the LN when it arrives.
@_date: 2017-01-10 01:15:34
The thing is, I work and earn bitcoin (my job pays me in BTC), so as a result all I have is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:56:39
Let's see when the Lightning Network gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:35:49
Do you have a link to where he said this?

It doesn't have to be a "bitcoin company", you could ask any employer to pay you in bitcoin, the only thing they need to do is buy and send it to your address.
Yes, there's also bitwage.
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:24:34
I see, that's very scary to think about. How to deal with the fear of this question when for example you store all of your life savings in bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:23:52
I really want to run Core but one of the reasons I don't run it is that my SSD doesn't have a lot of space.
I know prune exist, but then I won't be able to import private keys or addresses. How to deal with this dilemma?
@_date: 2017-01-10 00:49:45
True that, hence why I put all of my money into bitcoin. It's mostly warm-and-fuzzy feeling these days but there are still times like these where I think about it and freak out.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:53:40
Why light clients? I want to use Core.
Core will get SPV.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:18:40
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:22:03
With pruning I no longer can rescan right? Won't I have to rescan if I plan to import a key/address or restore from backup? Or can I just backup ~/.bitcoin and avoid rescaning?
I think I'll get the external drive.
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:41:34
Will that be a good investment though? Don't pendrives die out quickly as I write to them often?
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:59:21
That means I'll get to keep some of the latest blocks thus if my tx are in those blocks I get to restore from a backup?
I'm a little confused.
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:30:36
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:30:25


I see, my use case right now is moving from Electrum to Core, I have 1 address I was thinking to import, is it better to just make a new transaction instead?
I thought importing required rescan (having the blockchain)?


Interesting, can you explain how this works please? Does a new transaction is broadcasted and funds are sent to a new address? How does it work?
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:02:43
I really want to run a node but it takes too long to sync.
Do you guys know when they'll finish implementing SPV?
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:37:08
Thing is, I have a laptop with a small SSD as the main drive, I could use prune=550 but then what if I have to import a private key?
I was thinking of getting another drive also, but it would probably be a pain to carry the external drive all the time just to keep the blockchain in it.
Not sure what's the best solution.
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:23:49
I'd love to do my part and run a node also, but I only have a 256 GB SSD.
SUGGESTIONS PLEASE
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:32:00
@_date: 2016-12-24 19:05:36
Makes sense, thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:49:13
I'm pretty sure I'll do that at some point, yeah. I guess at this point I'll spend some money on a larger drive. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:36:11
Oh, you're on Windows? Arch Linux here.
How did you recovered the wallet?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:01:14


I want to use it as a wallet and I like Core better than other wallets. Isn't that good enough reason?
I also get paid in BTC for work and I want to use the most secure wallet, I think Core is that one.


Yes, that could work, but I don't have that new drive right now, would running it with prune=550 work OK right now?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:02:32
Thanks, makes sense.
Do you think I'll be OK using Core as a wallet with prune=550 then?
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:28:46
Right, but what are the situations that would led me to do a rescan?
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:32:54
Thanks, I guess I'll spend some money on a external hard drive.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:54:23
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:41:21
OK, thanks.
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:45:08
Will they add SPV support?
@_date: 2016-12-20 12:30:16
35 hours is still a lot of time, and I find it ridiculous I need to do a full sync for my transactions to show up and be able to spend.
Just enable SPV by default and keep syncing/validating in the background.
@_date: 2016-12-23 18:33:34
You're saying your wallet got corrupted in one of the older versions of Core? How did that happen?
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:12:30
It's very annoying having to carry an external drive with my laptop everywhere.

Do you think Hal faked all those conversations he had with Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:52:14
I'm not emotional and I'm not a sheep, I'm a human being and I'm trying to tell you the truth.
If you like bitcoin you probably value your freedom and privacy, using proprietary software from Microsoft (or any company) is no different than using a bank account at JPMorgan Chase, etc.
Proprietary software takes freedom away from users and gives them to the developers to treat/mistreat you however they want and you cannot protect yourself from that unless you escape from it.
Proprietary software is an injustice. Free software, like bitcoin itself, is a way to escape from that injustice/tyranny.
Why don't you try attacking my arguments instead of attacking/downvoting me?

No, that's a misunderstanding. As said, it's perfectly fine to [sell free software]( and it's perfectly fine to get paid to develop free software.
In fact, lots of people get paid to develop free software, people can get funded by crowdfunding campaigns, donations or you can start a business to develop free software.
Free software in fact creates a free market for anyone to make improvements on the existing free software that is available and charge for it, whereas proprietary software creates a monopoly for support.

Thank you, Satoshi.
I'm a developer from Brazil and bitcoin made it possible for me to continue working remotely and put food on my family's table, if it wasn't for bitcoin I would have given up working remotely a long time ago.
I've been unbanked for basically all my life and unable to transact internationally. After being burned with Western Union for several years, I decided to stop using them and switched to bitcoin, since then my life has improved so much: I learned a lot, I feel happier, I feel in control of my finances and life, I have more freedom and I will never go back.
I still remember how banks ignored me back in 2008 when I desperately needed a way to receive payments for my work, I begged them but no single bank wanted to accept me as their customer (and for no good reasons).
I was feeling hopeless and it has been a struggle for several years, but I no longer need them, Bitcoin Core makes me my own bank.
Bitcoin to me represents freedom and social improvement/inclusion, I'm sure there will be many others whose lives will be improved by bitcoin as well. I will forever be grateful for your creation and I feel it's my duty to contribute back to the community.
Transacting with the rest of the world, like speech, is a basic human right and bitcoin is the revolution that is already changing our world.
Thank you for making the world a better place.

Bitcoin will continue to improve itself through soft forks and improvements in the software.
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:00:25
I still couldn't find any places in Brazil that take bitcoin for food, etc.
I wonder why they don't do this for all the subway stores in all countries, it seems silly of them to take bitcoin in only one place.
It's still nice to see this though.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:01:24
I would support this as well.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:29:13


Huh? How is segwit unnecessary and why would we ever want to remove segwit?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:13:24
They removed the 3Bit stupidity.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:03:07
I don't think so, I'm just saying we could make improvements if we need to, it's not like we can't ever change anything in the protocol or the software itself.
Hard forks will always end up creating a new currency, hence why I prefer soft forks myself.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:00:21
The 3Bit thing is a joke and it would be annoying to do it for every transaction you make, this will also end up bloating the blockchain.
I wouldn't use this, I want to see real replay protection being implemented instead. Not holding my breath though.
I think I'll just ignore the S2X bullshit.
EDIT: 3Bit was removed.

Some people on  have been saying that it's not completely safe to open 8333 port because it could potentially leak private data like your wallet info. There have been claims about finding an exploit for bitcoind and resulting in losses if you have port 8333 open.
Could someone technically competent tell if there is any truth to these arguments? I don't know where they came with these ideas.

I disagree, the GPL was designed to protect users' freedom and it does that so well that it never failed in court.
If you are a business owner or proprietary software developer and all you care is leeching code from free software projects, then I'm sure you would be against it.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:52:26
Not at all, my GNU/Linux computers have zero backdoors/surveillance and I know that because I can see the code and understand everything.
This is why I will never use OSX or Windows for bitcoind or anything important, both of those systems phone home.
If you are talking about what most companies do, yes, most companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft do disgusting things like that.
Communities like the GNU/Linux community build good things that are freedom respecting. I'm talking about the community here, I don't care about those companies.
Quite honestly, it's not like Apple products are great or anything, a regular GNU/Linux desktop is much better these days than anything Apple has to offer.
Freedom and rights are important things.

Simply because a person is passionate about something doesn't automatically mean they are good.

"If the chain splits, then when / if / every time the BIP148 chain gets longer*, it will replace the legacy chain. Transactions that had confirmed on the legacy chain will become unconfirmed (unless they are also confirmed on the BIP148 chain). Bitcoins mined by legacy miners will cease to exist, as they lose their blocks. (This cannot occur in the inverse direction: no matter how long the legacy chain gets, BIP148 nodes will never let it reorg out the BIP148 chain.)"
I don't understand this, does it means I'll lose my BTC?
