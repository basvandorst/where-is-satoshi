I am only here to show the testing of the program, I have done much homework on the program and feel otherwise.  I was skeptical of the affiliate based stuff on the program too.  I had many questions about the program and have found them through simple research and talking to the support lines.  I understand the volatility of the market, we should all be safe.

I will be testing the program extensively for the next many months so I'll let the videos speak for themselves.  The trading program has been around for 2 years already, and I've made half my investment back in a month.  I need you to show me your results and evidence so I can believe your claim.

That's not how it works at all sadly, you should do some homework and I promise it doesn't sound that crazy.  They have trade bots that trade bitcoin at its high and low.  Very well known algorithm the bots are using, I could do it myself, but I work and the bots are 24/7 so ...

I am only agreeing with you that company probably won't be up for more than 2 years, because I feel like bitcoin will stop going up and down after it is completely mined.  I'm being paid off the volatility of the market through this company, take that away then it would be gg for companys like this.  Until then I should have more than tripled my profit.

Again, I need evidence for any FUD type claims.  There is so much time before the market becomes as stable as you're saying where interest is not made. My guess is 2 years.  So, before the stuff you are talking about even becomes relevant, there will be people making loads of money until then.  As well as after ....

They aren't sure how the market will react, but I'm quite sure they are resuming lending services after August 1st.  They already have payments pending for those days on my account.

I see this program lasting for at least 2 years, that's a long time to make money!

I will definitely let you know how it goes!  I will continue to post videos on my progress.  This does seem unbelievable, but so does cryptocurrency in general.  Check the channel again in a month and see if you change your mind.
