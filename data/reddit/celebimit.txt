He is right that it would be really expensive and difficult for a government to amass 51% hash power. However, if it does happen miners will not be able to brush it off as easily as he explained. 
There's no reason for the attacker to publicize the chain he just mined to the bitcoin network every time he mines one. All it has to do is continue mining on top of its own blocks in secrecy. Because the attacker has more hash power than the rest of the world, by the time everyone reaches block 600000 the attacker could be on block 600100. Once the attacker publishes this block, all miners will treat block 600100 as the main chain since the bitcoin protocol will always treat the longest/most difficult chain as the true chain. This is the essence of PoW. Yes, the community can acknowledge the attack and all choose to ignore this chain. However this takes time and  would require the bitcoin community to perform a fork. This isn't the government creating an "NSA blockchain". This is everyone else forking AWAY from the main bitcoin chain. As long as the attacker continues to have more hashpower than the rest of the community, the attacker can choose to secretly mine off the fork and unleash the attack yet again some time in the future. 
As stated in the white paper, 51% attacker would not perform the attack out of greed because it would devalue the bitcoin network as a whole and cause all of the bitcoins he has to be worthless. A government attacker wouldn't care about having more bitcoin; its intention IS TO DESTROY IT. 
That being said, I don't think any country with the power to pull off such an attack would want to do so when the rest of the world is starting to understand the potential of blockchain/DLT and beginning to regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That would be synonymous to starting a cold war.
