price are first drived low by exchanges that never want to allow public audits of theirs accounts, so we can think a big part of theirs coins are not backed up by any real bitcoins. When you see a dump that follows a bunch of good news, here you can imagine that is simply market manipulation. Probably big companies that made announcement the past month are waiting for the september falls to start any btc related project, as economy is often slowed during summer. And 2 of the 3 big btc rallies happened during sept/oct/november months, so it's the perfect time to dump prices and get plenty of coins for cheap. Lot of sell-of, yes, but It would be more terrific if no one want to buy them. At this time, the drop is pretty continuous, we don't see any gap (as it must be, when desillisuion come and lot of order don't find buyers)...be patient, or don't trade with money you need to rent your home or buy food..

I suppose you can build such a story with any guy named "s. Nakamoto" and who don't want to reply to your questions, or reply in an evasive way.
Beside, the "Descended from Samurai and the son of a Buddhist priest" is nothing else than two stupid "cliché", hopefully SN is not australian, with a Kangooroo as father, born on the famous Ayers Rock...

ponzi scheme is not something build on top of money, and should not be seen as a 'scam' taking benefit out of an exploit of an unsure system (read here money as a system).
ponzi scheme is the inherent structure of money, i.e. any money get its value from previous ppl who used it.
Or consider it's an infinite scam, that started more than 4000 years ago, and that will go longer and longer, as well as we are not able (or don't want) to admit that the medium and the value are two different things.
Since reason mean our lifes, from the shell to the dollar, the mean is to let the medium take over the value, that is true about money, that is true about religious dings, that is true about anything you're ready to trust on.
A travel is valued when you join the destination, and how much is valuable the airplane under the see obviously don't make your travel more valuable.
The young wolves say that bitcoin will reach $100000, old ones say that interest rate of BCE or FED have to lower.
The two have disconnected value and medium, in the way that could fill their own greed.
Catch ants with sugar.
Beside, anyone to notice that  the value and the medium are not enough to describe what a money is?

use only exchange places where transactions (sell/buy) happen for real (i.e. where all transactions are registered on the blockchain) -&gt;no more fake orders/market manipulation, volatility will only happen on longer time frame, nefarious intraday trading won't be possible.
keep trading decentralized, or today's exchanges will become banks soon or later, and old problems related to old world will happen again.

to overclock the old block erupter (sapphire) for free, you can use big crystal oscillator  found on old isa/pci soundcard (1990's ones) like this one : 
The trick work for months on mine! Don't forget to add a fan to avoid overheat.

no, rather it's related to past day DDOS, all exchange places have been attacked: I think attackers are testing if the tx-malleability is a possible exploit somewhere...

on [localbitcoins.com]( you can choose any payment method, start with one you know...
@_date: 2014-02-15 17:10:37
I think it's a bit too late to do so..you should did that one week ago. But if you're sure about your analysis, go on bitfinex, you can play short with leverage..

you need to have at least 0.4Btc in your LCB wallet. Or maybe there is a problem with your price equation (unresolvable). It could happen too if your add is set to filter peoples ( i.e. those with less than x amount of trades), and you are yourself under this limits...

confirmed feedback comes from users with large amount of transactions and who already  have a good reputation. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:59:16
0. read carefully the security and exchange guides on localbitcoins (  )
1.choose old timer buyer with good reputation score and enough volume of transactions
2. little transaction the first time
2. safe and public place
3. one friend with you
4. counterfeit money detector if possible
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:38:46
you can use localbitcoins as well...maybe there is bitcoiner near you that you can meet in person:

you can also buy with any online payment system here...
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:52:48
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:45:43
it's where you've have been 'faked'...rather refer to the reputation given by other users (on the website itself), and check the transaction volume and the number of different users who do trade with your buyer/seller. The "real name required" option is a must to use option for online trade, too...

this guy miss the point : ppl doesn't invest in bitcoin now cause it's (or could be) a money, but cause it's a payment system. BTC won't become a currency up to many years, but it's already a payment system, getting more and more acceptance this days, as it's cheaper than i.e. paypal and offer easyness for cross-border transactions.
Secondly, as economist, he didn't see the technologic background of bitcoin, which is some kind of really valuable innovation...
so he said "bitcoin is not valuable', but without any idea about what bitcoin is.

BTC-e is in the "top 3" of the exchange place in the world (look at the volumes), so, about a business growing more and more each day, I don't see where they can find interest in scamming (and note that even gangsters at one time reinvest in legal activities, what most profitable business can you find atm?).
I think that you probably have to deal with bank regulations and controls, especially if you've transfered a big amount. The funds can be on their account but locked by authority the time some investigation are done. And obviously, it would not be a good things for them to communicate about this  painfull background...
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:29:55
11 days (the shortest), up to 36 days (the longest) delay for me... MTgox have a separate account in Poland to process EU withdrawnal, so there is no problem like you can see with US $..
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:47:30
rather use the localbitcoins.com, where you can evaluate yourself (and with other users evaluations) if your trade partner is honest or not :

keep cool....wait for at least one confirmation, and copy/paste your btc adress into the search bar of blockchain.info to see how confirmations progress..It have been really big moves on exchanges places this past hours so bitcoin network could be slow...

it's about withdrawnal done in october, but it's true that mtgox say now delay can be up to 8 weeks, I haven't tried since they have changed that.
@_date: 2013-12-19 06:57:10
all this things about 'coin validation' is maybe a trick to take control of bitcoin excluding all peoples using it before regulations comes, i.e. : pretty all existing bitcoins could be said to be illegaly tainted, cause used on "illegal" exchange places, "illegal" gambling websites and so on...Such a take over is possible and would benefit to banksters and gvts..
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:59:49
localbitcoins is really the best way, the "outrageous" prices are not so, if you consider other place take 2 to 4% for in and out, then add some more fees from your bank...I prefer to pay 10% more on localbitcoins.com than an unknow final price elsewhere.
Meeting someone in person could also lead you to meet other "bitcoiner" in your town. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:47:50
just go with cash if you want to stay anonymous..

no, it's exactly the confusing thing I want to point out : the fact that the transaction service is not an escrow, and that the buyer is not protected just cause it's said "the seller have funded the transaction"...

""He sent me his transaction log (all positive feedback)"" --&gt; does you mean he send you a log thru messaging? or does you refer to the user reputation you can see on his localbitcoins public profile?
reminder that online payment are unsecure, unless you use irreversible payment (Okpay is irreversible , paypal or bank transfer are not). 
With all the checks you do, it's probably someone who get his computer hacked (and so all his private data / accounts), or the regular user scammed you with his real identity.
Just start a complaint and send the complaint report to LocalBitcoins support, they will provide you all infos they have about this scammer (loggings Ip's and connections timestamp, email used to register, mobile phone) so you can give this info to police.
If you provide a mobile phone number to police, the scammer could be caught in less than 48h, but you probably won't get your money back so easily...
