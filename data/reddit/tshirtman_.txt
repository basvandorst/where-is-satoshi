Electron is a standalone container for web applications, based on on chrome, so it allows creating desktop applications using web (html/css/javascript) technologies.
Since it's based on google chrome, it's not exactly lightweight, and some apps (random example, slack) using it, have been frowned upon for being too heavyweight.

[reply deleted while i was typing mine, nice]
Bitcoin Cash's cheap transactions are mostly because it gets used a *lot* less than bitcoin (count the total number of transaction on both chain since the fork, it's more than 5x less!, and in 10% more blocks! no mystery the fees are low!), If it was used nearly as much, the blocks would be full too, and it would be worse because people wouldn't be as careful about it as with bitcoin (bitcoin cash users are trying to fill their blocks with on-chain $.5 tips going around, lol).
Since these blocks would be full, they would be looking into increasing the limit to 100MB at minimum (probably 1GB or 1TB as i saw people starting to refer to), always giving to the pressure of gaining in popularity/usage, and soon nobody would be able to run a node, because syncing one would be too slow to ever catch up, and you'd be adding new disks to your bays/raid arrays every over day.
Cheap/fast is not a magical choice you can make, it's easy to do for a few people, the blockchain model, while being very good to establish consensus in a trustless environment, doesn't scale well, and is very costly to sustain at a world-population level.

How can you get things so wrong? Theseu's ship applies to anything that changes over time, i was talking about bitcoin's core team here, but that applies to the code too, as well as a rock band, or your own body, of which all cells are replaced over time, and yes you somehow maintain your identity.
Your story about the birth of SegWit is still immensely wrong, Bitcoin was put on github by Gavin, after Satoshi left, the team gained new members and evolved over time, and *years* after, SegWit was proposed to fix the malleability issue, and others. It's not some example code, it's the very code of Bitcoin, which was improved by the team that released all the previous versions of bitcoin.
I understand you think it's con, it's not needed, it's not the real thing, i get it, but if you want me to believe you have good reason to think that, you should stop making things up. And there is no more reason to call Bitcoin a pyramid scheme after the SegWit merge than before, SegWit doesn't change the economic properties of Bitcoin at all.
Maybe you are a troll pulling my leg, i have way too much patience for these, most people i know would have stopped engaging long ago, but i'm stupid like that, believing people are honest, so i'm trying.
But i might start to run a little low on tolerance to bullshit.

you seem to trust your imagination more than published specifications that are implemented by multiple teams, openly, you have no interest in checking your assumptions and confront your mental model of something to the reality, you simply don't care, that's really sad. You don't want to read the summary, because it's not the real thing, you are not interested in reading the white paper, i guess that's not to be trusted, but i don't dare to imagine you are willing to read the code of one of the implementation?
Nobody is taking the money the two involved parties are building the channel with, it's still all bitcoins, there is no new coin involved, they just prove to each others that they are not using them for something else, they do so using plain bitcoin transactions, and the channel updates are just new bitcoins transactions that replace the initial ones, but you are not interested in actually understanding that, so i'm not sure whom i'm writing that for.
That's ok, i guess, i don't have to waste my time trying to convince you, i did what i could.

I understand what you say, i just point out that by this definition, Bitcoin is dead, nobody has been using it for more than 5 years.
That you don't understand that it makes this definition flawed confuse me.
And i don't know what you read about LN, but either it was wrong, or you didn't understand it, because the only way somebody could walk off, backing from transactions, is extremely risky to them, and it'll certainly won't happen ever.


I don't know where you read that, but afaik, it's completly wrong, satoshi doesn't even had a github account, he never pushed any code to github.

 &gt; It's not my imagination that those things work the way I described. Not only did i accurately describe their functionality within the programming, because I was describing their limitations given their function (which I understand perfectly)
No, you do not describe what LN does, and you attach properties to it that it doesn't have. You admitted yourself that you are not interested enough to read its technical description, and yet you assume that your understanding of it is "perfect", i don't claim my understanding of Bitcoin is perfect (it's quite a complex project, i barely scratched the surface), but i can see that a lot of things you are saying are plain wrong, and you are totally not interested in learning about it, you just want to spread your misunderstanding.


He made that project open source, found contributors, and left, the team evolved since, but that's the same as with all projects, the parts change and yet the identity stays (you can read about [The ship of Theseus]( for an understanding of the philosophical side of this question).
No project uses the exact code that Satoshi left, and for good reasons, we have better versions of it now.
Segwit was a pull request (a set of change) in the github, like most of the change to a project, it was made separately until it was integrated, do I need to explain that? Are you a developer? If you are not i understand better if you struggle with these concepts, it's ok, it's not your job (it's mine), but don't think you get it all, be ready to learn before saying things. So, SegWit was a set of changes, and then it was merged, now it's part of Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is what the bitcoin core team produce, not anything else, that's the only sensible way to track a project.
LN is not unnecessary, even bitcoin cash supporters now understand that second layer solutions are needed, because to manage the world's need in transaction with bitcoin, you'd need to produce (and store forever) terabytes of data every day, LN allows to drastically reduce that, if you have better solutions, we are listening, but don't say that Bitcoin solves it on its own, it's simply, factually, false.
You also didn't show any attack that the LN network allow, but good luck doing that without studying it the slightest.
I'm definitly not "getting into it today", i've been interested in it since late 2010… (not full time, but since this early, yes).
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:10:57
at least you *can* review the software, and even if few people actually do it, it does make it harder/riskier to try to hide things there (even if some people are very good at [that game]( With hardware, even if you had the spec sheet to review, building the thing yourself is a lot harder, so nobody will do it, and checking that the hardware really is what it looks like, takes X-ray through the die, is an incredible amount of work, that a lot fewer people know how to do, and have access to the tools for. Reviewing binaries is certainly easier.
Of course, the software ultimately runs on hardware, and you have to trust *that* hardware, but you have more choice on this side, it seems raspberry pies are immune to Meltdown/Spectre, so you can use one to run bitcoin-core or electrum, using the linux distribution of your choice, and be *pretty* safe i think.

@_date: 2018-01-03 22:01:05
maybe you are right, maybe you've been lucky, time will tell.
if you really sold two weeks ago, you've been lucky anyway, because you sold not long after the ATH, and at the beggining of the serious dip, and if you picked the right alts, yes, you could have great returns, but the fees didn't prevent the fantastic rise of this last 6 months, so i doubt it's the cause of the crash.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:31:42
I'm still in the ”don't put money you can't lose” camp, and homeless people usually don't have much of that, even if it doesn't suddently go to 0, the volatility would certainly put another burden on already difficult lives, and if (when) the fees rise again, i wouldn't like to be the guy telling them their funds are unspendable because they are ”dust”.
I agree about the issue you are trying to solve though, maybe an altcoin like LTC would be more suited (i think it's safe to assume SPV wallets only would be considered anyway), i don't know that, but it's good to dig in that direction.

Iota actually has a "coordinator", and it's unclear they'll be able to remove it any day.
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:00:40
It's an open source project, and as often in that, it's current developers that promote new developers based on their contributions, anyone can try to contribute, if your contribution fits and help the project, you'll get more influence, and earn rights to merge contributions into the master branch of the code (what people will actually use).
That evolution can also sometime be contentious, especially when previous developers are removed from the team, for being inactive or for being in disagreement with the rest of the team.
Some developers are paid by some companies to work, part or full time, on open source projects, because these companies think it's good for them, bitcoin does have paid developers of this sort.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:48:25
i agree, but their plan was to be fully on-chain, and while we know (at least i believe so) that it won't scale enough, it's been working great to make their story compelling (and i know they get barely any usage compared to bitcoin, but that doesn't really matter for a good story).
The fact they get so few usage might be a better reason to call it failed, but it still have quite some valuation, which makes it less clear.

How do you do that in LN?
Every LN transaction creates a new state, up to date with all the transaction since the channel started.
Both party can agree to settle the channel, and dispatch this state to the chain, they both have immediate access to their funds according to that last transaction.
One party can send this state to the bitcoin chain, closing the channel, without the other party's agreement, but since it's a transaction they agreed to, there is no problem with that, and they'll have access to their fund immediatdly, while the party that closed on their own have to wait.
If one party tries to send an earlier state of the chain, thus trying to walk back on transactions that where made since, the other party has a reasonnable time window to claim all the funds in the channel, which makes it *very* risky for someone to do that.
Now please tell me if there are other possibilities that i'm not aware of, or how someone could somehow do what you are saying, in these situation?
Your point about bitcoin's definition is moot, because if you go in this direction, the only thing you can refer as Bitcoin is the original code that Satoshi Nakamoto released calling Bitcoin, and any change to that, even that he or she (or them) did to it after that would have to be called something else, live projects evolve, get over it. Who owns the name is whom has been managing the project for the longest, without stopping caring for it. I understand ownership of a project is a rather complex subject (as a maintainer of open source software myself), but the general accepted rule applies here, Bitcoin is what the bitcoin core team says it is, even if they decided to break it appart (which you may think they are doing), it wouldn't give anybody the right to call their fork "Bitcoin", doing that is just too confusing, it's bad, and it shouldn't be done, even if the forkers really believe they are fulfilling the original vision, and that the other part is crazy and has lost its way, or even if they are believed to be actually evil, you *don't* do that, you find another name, and you build the thing you think should be built.

lol, this place is messed up.
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:12:50
See that?
None of these people claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, whose only contributions certainly are under the "non-github-bitcoin", as you can see, their only commits are from 2010, everything after is the result of other contributors, a lot of them still active these days.
Since blocks have been mined every 10 minutes for the last 9 years, most of that time has been after 2010, so most blocks have been mined after Satoshi Nakamoto went away, and while a lot of change to the code was happening.
So your claim is just non-sensical, "what the majority of blocks where mined on" is not exactly what Satoshi released, and it's been changing gradually over the last 7 years.
Yes, blocksize changes where mentionned, including by Satoshi, but as with a lot of things, discussions in the following years came to a conclusion that it might not be a great idea, so the team decided not to do it, you may claim it's a stupid decision, but you are not in charge of the project, you don't get to decide what bitcoin is. And if you are going to say this is a *legal* thing, you'll have to give references, and i think it's going to be hard to find one that says what you say, i may be wrong, as we say, IANAL, but i would be surprised.
That you are not interested in LN is fine, really, what's not is that you are spreading FUD about how its properties, that you didn't bother checking, you heard it was something additional to bitcoin, that it was not distrubuted, and you assumed things, or trusted things you read about it, without caring to read opposite arguments, or even the most dumbed down presentation about what it is. LN doesn't automatically creates banks, it doesn't create central nodes that can censor the network, and it doesn't prevent anybody to do on-chain transaction, if anything, it'll make it easier, because with many transactions going off of it, the fees will lower, and the time spent in pool will lower dramatically.
Nobody can run with the transaction list in LN, if both party agree to it, it's certainly possible not to dispatch anything, but that would require both party not only to agree, but to trust each other not to dispatch any of the transactions later, it would be *much* easier to just create a last transaction to put the funds at the initial level, and close that, as i said before, no party can unilaterally "forget" some transactions, at least not without taking an enormous risk for themselves.
It's not "somewhat mitigated", both party can dispatch the latest state at any time, if the other party becomes unresponsive/uncooperative, they can broadcast the state, and they'll get their funds back, and if a party broadcast an outdated state, it's like playing russian roulette, if the other party is looking, they'll be able to take the whole stash.
LN is not an escrow, an escrow is a third party both A and B trust, when A and B don't trust each others, there is no "C" person here, A and B sign the updated state after each transactions in a way that protects them both.
I won't spend any more time repeating myself anyway, learn about what LN is, *then* talk about it, until that *you* are the attack, because you are spreading unsubstantiated FUD.

While you do get these answers, you also get serious answers to any serious questions, you don't need to engage with the unhelpful/zealot answers, there is space for meaningful discussions too.
I've been convinced there was numerous problems with bitcoin, and that ways used to solve them where currently disastreous, and discussing with people, and reading links provided by them, made me way more confidence about the current state of things and the future, even if there are, indeed, challenges. I currently don't know of a crypto that did better, more future-proof, choices for its scaling.

He's know for a tendency to exagerate his wealth, he doesn't possess the buildings that bear his name (or at least most of them). Also, maybe he got lucky, or maybe it was actually a genius move, but the fact that his name was an asset people paid for, meant that letting him go bust would destroy their investment, which saved him when he was bankrupt.
I also assume he was at least functional for most of his adult life, now it's hard to look at his behavior and assume that's the case, but he's not exactly young, and it doesn't mean he was always like this.

LN is no more an escrow than Bitcoin is, there is no third party, because the protocol allows them to exchange without trust. Bitcoin is what gives the basis to that, if anything, Bitcoin is the escrow to LN, but it's a technical device, it's not an entity, so that's a stretch to the definition.

I though exactly the same about ”full nodes” before.
But this depends entirely on which node your node connects to, if you assume users connect to a random node,  the more nodes, miners or not, the less chance a miner can try and cheat.
That nodes have to relay (and thus can filter) transactions until it hits a miner seems like a good thing to me, because it gives more resistance against spam.

Yes, but play it safe, don't get yourself if debt for it, and take into account it could drop 50% or more, and you should be able to keep your head cool and wait for it to recover, or even carry on with your life it it goes to 0.
edit: also i'd say don't bother with mining, it's a lot more investment, and more risky, your equipment is garanteed to become too weak in some months to a year, you are not sure to break even, it's more likely you earn more just hodling.

Bitcoin is the only decentralized crypto to have tested some interesting level of scaling.

@_date: 2018-01-13 20:23:09
I know SegWit is a change to the bitcoin protocol (i've been interested in Bitcoin since 2010), but it's not the first, nor the last, lively projects have the singular difference from dead projects, that they change. Some people think this change is important enough not to be the thing anymore, some think otherwise, some think it's a good change, some think otherwise, but that's part of what bitcoin is today, because the people who defined what bitcoin is in the last few years, have decided that's part of it, if you don't like it, find another project that doesn't apply this change, call it Bitcoin Classic if you want, but that's not what Bitcoin is today. If you're about to tell me that Bitcoin cash is the true Bitcoin, let me tell you already that it also contains changes from the original Bitcoin released by Satoshi Nakamoto, and one can consider that changing the blocksize to 8MB is a defining change already, and it can't be called "Bitcoin" anymore than Bitcoin. There were alt-coins with bigger block size long before Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin stuck to this size, so if you really want to be splitting hair about what is Bitcoin, nothing is, anymore, and probably nothing has been since Satoshi left.
LN is a protocol, it's not a third party. There is a company called the same, but it doesnt "own" the LN, and it doesn't have the only available implementation, the protocol is open, published, and liberally licensed (CC-BY), anybody can do whatever with it, and the major implementations are open source, you can deploy it on your computer, it's not any more third party than any open source wallet software.
LN sits on bitcoin, it's secured by it, and secures the transactions until they are settled on it again. The only known opportunity for theft is well defined and comes at a great risk for the attacker, which can easily lose all its fund. To my knowledge, the other possibilities you are talking about, don't exist. Everything is cryptographically signed by all parties involved, nobody can change the transactions, there is no escrow, anybody trying to walk with anything can be severly punished, again, by losing all their assets in the network. There is no regeging or charging-back, it has all the same properties as bitcoin, except it's not publicly broadcasted, so it's less costly, faster, and protects the privacy of involved party better.
It's ok to criticize everything, but what you are telling doesn't seem to be even remotely connected to reality.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:56:33
It's true, crypto allows for more assymetry between attack and defense in a lot of cases, sadly, the innovation brought by bitcoin, while good enough to solve the issue it intended (trustless, decentralized consensus) rely on a more ”bruteforce” approach.
This is sad, and i'd love to see a better solution, but on the other hand, the issue was though to be unsolvable before that, so time will tell if there are more optimal solutions, but i didn't hear about them (i'm not an expert at all, the iota solution seemed nice at first, but i'm now pretty sure it's flawed).
I agree volatility is an issue for usage, but it's an effect of growth, won't go away until people's confidenceein the solution stabilize, when it's way bigger than now.

how many time will this have to be explained…
low fees transactions doesn't impact higher fees transactions, such a spam method would be completly ineffective.
These transactions where out of the mempool because they were so far down they were unlikely to be processed, and dropped by nodes because their memory has to have some limit, and it's no use filling it with transactions that won't be confirmed.
Now pressure is going down, there are less transactions waiting, these have actually some chance of getting processed, so as they get rebroadcasted by the nodes that made them (or others), they get included again.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:22:19
If it's an escrow, then telling somebody privately "i owe you 5" is an escrow too, although a much worse one.
If you can't be bothered to read the LN whitepaper (i can totally understand that, it's certainly longer then the Bitcoin whitepaper), you can at least read the 2 pages technical summary, before saying things about it that are wrong?
The blockchain sees the initial funding, and updates to the fundings, and the closing of the channel, all the things in between happen between the two participants, using a protocol to update the state, and be ready to settle it on chain at any moment, cooperatively or not, they don't need to trust each others, or any third party, they have their mutual signature ensuring (strongly) they will get their funds on chain when they settle.
It's also wrong to say that LN is not part of bitcoin, *all* LN transactions are bitcoin transactions, LN is just a way to only dispatch the latest transaction in a chain of them, when the channel is closed, but all of these intermediate transactions are valid bitcoin transactions, not dispatching them is just an optimisation, which reduces costs dramatically.

Yes it's problematic, better to avoid them as much as possible, but segwit does allow a small one because it's implausible that 1mb is going to be enough on the long run. It's also an incentive to upgrade i guess.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:12:47
If you only pick "old" transactions, you can't do more than 1MB, if you pick segwit ones, they are counted differently, so you can cram more of them, which allows to go over 1MB, the more segwit transactions, the more transactions you can fit, to a maximum of a bit less than 4MB.
Miners try to maximize profit, so they look for the maximum amount of fees they can put in a block, so for the same fee on two transaction, a segwit one will be usually preferred, people using segwit may be more cautious about fees, and they do want their discount, so they would usually put less fees, according to how weight is computed, and of course, depending on how patient they are. So in the end, unless a miner is willing to lose some money to increase segwit addoption by prioritizing their transactions, there is not much possibility for them to do bigger blocks until more of the "interesting" (fee-wise) transactions are waiting.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:47:12
I can understand, just look at the bigger picture, yes it's scary, but bitcoin history is full of bloodbaths like this, 30, 50, even 80% down, when you put money into it, you should understand the gains you saw before are not assured, and that it's going to make you crazy if you are not ready to lose this money.

@_date: 2018-01-07 16:09:10
In short, there is only so much space for transaction in each block, so only so much transactions can go in, others have to wait, so people put more reward for the miner to be selected first, this create fee inflation if there is more demand than what can be offered.
Segwit, making transaction smaller, should allow to fit more transactions per block, and so allow stopping fee inflation, and maybe go back to cheap transactions. But it's not enough for some of the transaction to be segwit-enabled, to diminish pressure — and fees — you want most of them to be.

If you don't have the time/will to type a proper answer, don't pretend you have one.
You are just arbitrary deciding that a change is big enough to warrant a new name, you are not the project creator (i think i can safely assume by now), and you don't have any authority over that, you don't seem to be a lawyer either, and are just trying to give some weight to a flawed argument by adding "by law", that's only effective at making your argument irrelevant.
SegWit is the name of the set of changes, because it can be useful to name things like set of changes, for easy reference, once it's merged into Bitcoin, that set of change is part of Bitcoin's definition, deal with it.
Bitcoin wasn't prefect, and it's still not, and it'll certainly never be, you are falling to the fallacy of worshiping a design set in stone, and disregard it's limitation to be able to refuse any change to it. If you are fine with the limitations it had and not with some new limitation you think it has, fine, go build a Bitcoin Classic, or settle with Bitcoin Cash, because somehow the 8MB "bigblocks" change doesn't trigger your "any change imply name change" policy, that seems to actually only apply to SegWit.
Names are useful, really, we should use more of them, but you should still understand what's behind a name to be able to talk about it, or at least trying to describe it autoritatively, is it too much to ask?
I'm not even an export on either SegWit or LN, i'm not making up things, i'm just asking you to substantiate your claim, and not to make up things doing so.
And you are failing at that, hard.

A mining node has no more power to reject a block than a non-mining one, it can create new blocks, but if the rest have come to a consensus, they'll just ignore his, so in this regard, nobody has a vote.

I don't know exactly when that changed, but when i was reading r/btc more often, barely 2 months ago, off-chain transactions where a big no-no, and anyone suggesting it was necessary just didn't believe in the technology, or worse, was a bank shill.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:54:07
I don't think it would make sense to do that, the whole point of making high fee transactions for a miner/spammer, is to drive the transaction price up, so you want the signal of the current price that has to be paid to be as visible as possible, if people see currently there are ~1MB of Tx waiting at 500+s/b, they'll set a higher price than that, to be validated.
Also, if miners mined their own transactions this way, it would be pretty easy to prove they are the ones spaming the network, and it would be pretty much the same effect that mining half-full blocks. Broadcasting the transactions gives plausible deniability (on what's largely considered an attack, so it's totally desirable).

You actually want these routes to go somewhere, if everybody only has 1 route to 1 other node, you don't get a network.
You could decide to open like 3 routes to 3 random nodes as a simple strategy to create a very well connected network, but it's only natural that a well connected node will give you access to a lot of other nodes easily.
Edit, also, opening a channel means freezing some money that will only be able to be used with the nodes you can reach through this connection, you certainly want your user to have some saying in that, at least until the network is dense enough that "random" is guaranteed to give good results.

no, the transaction format changed, the signatures got moved around not to be counted as part of the size anymore, because they can then be discarded later, which makes the blocks smaller when counted without them. the whole new format is segwit, the whole old format is legacy. When miners creates a block, they take transactions from the pool, some are segwit, some are not.

The argument is not new, i saw it a lot last year (and i admit i though it was obviously true before doing more research, discussions here have been very helpful), the important part imho is that LN has properties that makes centralisation much less an issue than they thinks, and that it's not in any way comparable to the current banking system. So even if there was a real centralisation effect, it wouldn't create censorship or confiscation opportunities.

You said twice that somebody could "walk away with the transaction list" making them disappear.
The transaction list is owned and signed by both party, if one party becomes unresponsive or uncooperative, the other party can dispatch the last state to the network, settling all these transactions on chain, the only downside in this case is that they'll have to wait to have access to their funds (as i explained every time you made that assertion, and you didn't take my answer into account, just restated the same thing, that's why i'm saying you are doing unsubstantiated claims).
Also, nobody should base public transactions on the basis of private LN transactions not yet settled to chain, because they are not yet public, your points make absolutely no sense.
If what you present are facts, please give a reference to them, ideally in the white paper, or less ideally, in a technical analysis explaining how that would work.
Your definition of the project implies at the very least that it ceased being developed when Satoshi left, and that nobody has been using it for years, since everybody upgraded when new versions came out. This is a stupid definition, and i doubt you'll find any judge willing to rule in that direction.
Bitcoin has been open since the beginning, it doesn't (and never, in any project) means that anybody can make change to it and get them included, it means that everybody can do their own versions, and can try to contribute back, and these changes may be accepted if they fit the goals of the project, it's true of *any* open source project, Bitcoin is not different.
(jeez! you are almost getting me worked up)
Now you are making stuff up, Satoshi never talked about SegWit, or LN, or their principles, whoever it is, disappeared long before these where even conceived, what you are doing is borderline religious, putting words in the mouth of a (dead or gone) autority figure, to give them weights and power, that's ill-advised, and dangerous. (You are free to give any reference to these claims, i doubt they'll be about SegWit or LN, or even about concepts remotely related to them).

Different risks, your money in the system slowly lose value, so in the end, if it continue this way it *will* be worthless, but it'll take a lot of time, and the rate is pretty clear. On the other hand, with crypto, and at least with bitcoin, the value of your money goes skyward, very fast, but the rate is way harder to predict, and with the short history we have, it could as well stard dropping just as fast.
So yeah, you would think putting all of your money in crypto is sensible to avoid losing all the value, but there is value in the knowledge that you'll have 99% tomorrow that what you had today, when the alternative is having somwhere between 50 and 120% (and that's short term, days or weeks, in the longer term — months/years — with bitcoin, it's more like between 0 and 10000%, which is in the *crazy* territory to put your life savings on).

(just copy pasting the comment i left there)
It's a powerful narative, and i've believed for quite some time.
The problem is, this goes very fast on the "increase the block" solution, which makes the chain more expensive to process, sure there are very interesting ways to mitigate that, the network costs can be kept low, and the required processing power can be made acceptable, i don't think there is a solution to the storage costs, however, and while a moderate increase would make things better now, it wouldn't help so little, that we would need another such increase soon.
Now, the other issue, is that the debate over this increase has been subject to manipulation, and both sides barely talk to each others, over than to call names, and if there was a way to come to an agreement long ago, it's been passed over.
And while i was certainly in the big block camp for some time, and a bch believer, i do think that the manipulation is worse on this side, and the narative is flawed, of the two echo chambers, it's the worse.
But don't take my word for it, do your own research.﻿

Their opinion (that i'll admit i shared for some time), is that bitcoin has been taken over, and that the current bitcoin implementation is moving away from the original idea, so it's only natural that the one that is closer to the original idea (in their opinion) is the real thing.

I find this remark bizarre, the tx costs in BTC doesn't come from segwit or some other technical change done in BTC, it comes from an increased adoption of BTC that means the blocks are full and mempool is growing, which makes people compete on fees for transaction speed.
LTC blocks are happening much more often than BTC ones, so you get more tx/s which avoid the issue (until usage grows too much), BTC blocks are bigger than BTC ones, which also avoids the issue (until usage grows too much), for both it's at the cost memory/bandwidth. But If their usage outgrew the limit, the fees would also grow.
Segwit adoption would also reduce the pain for BTC, since it would increase the number of TX in a block without either increasing block size or lowering time between blocks.
But for any of them, it seems it won't be enough for the much larger adoption we hope/expect to see in the long run.
LN is one answer to that, and yes, it has costs too, but you don't *need* a channel between say, OpenBazaar and all of its users, since it's a network too, you can hop from one node to another, and i expect people will have channels with a few well linked nodes in the environment, and OB will have too, so new users will be able to start with that, and later open a direct channel if their use justifies it.

LN transactions are not broadcasted, they are directly between two parties, so you have some crypto at each step, but with decent computers, millions or even billions tps between two parties seems entirely possible, you could assume two servers with 10Gbs ethernet link between them, and quite some power, they only have to talk to each others, the amount of transactions would be very high.
Of course, not all LN usages will be as fast as this one, but then again, you don't need a million tps between you and amazon or even your bank (assuming it's used as a hub).

disclaimer: I didn't finish reading the paper yet, so my understanding is very light.
Both side of the channel starts with an amount of money, commited to this channel, each transaction updates the amount on both side, and at any moment, the new amounts can be settled on the chain (closing the channel), which will create a more classical bitcoin transaction, it doesn't mean the transactions are not real, it means the rest of the world doesn't know about them yet, but you can't (afaik) "back off" of them, if the other side of the channel becomes unresponsive, you should be able to close the channel, because you have the updated signed transaction from the other party.

Nice, although i got confused by this and i guess a few others will be.
Bitstamp has segwit deployed, and Electrum supports segwit, but you can't send from Bitstamp to an Electrum segwit address.
Why? because they don't support the same kind of segwit addresses.
- Electrum only allows creating bech32 addresses (starting with "bc1")
- Bitstamp supports P2SH segwit addresses (starting with a 3) addreses
I'm still catching up about the differences, but that's irrelevant, the point is, they two supports "segwit" but not the same one, i asked Bitstamp support about it, but got no answer yet (asked yesterday, so i'm not complaining). AFAIK it wouldn't be a problem to send from Electrum to Bitstamp at least, because they don't (and can't really) care about what address the bitcoins come from, but it's a bit of a pitty for withdrawal, that i would have to use an intermediate non-segwit wallet.
edit: also, i'm confuse, yesterday the "addresses" page of the bitcoin wiki presented both segwit formats, and that was removed since.
 is this still in developpment or controversial for some reason?

I don't think LN makes bitcoin easier to use, but it makes it easier to use for a lot more things, not because the UI/UX is better, but because bitcoin on its own can't be used by that many people at the same time.
The irony of bitcoin, is that even if the chain is distributed, it still is a ~~single point of failure~~ bottleneck, because if the demand outgrow its limited capacity (1 bloc every 10 minutes, which means about 7 tx per second), then you can't grow anymore.
LN is more like a file in memory, it'll be changed a lot of time, and the hard disk drive will only see the final result when you save, if all your programs were writing to disk every change, your PC would be a *lot* slower.

Except what was not immediatly obvious (except to people familiar with distributed systems) was despite being decentralized, there was actually a limited resource, which is the tx rate, defined by block size/block rate, that it's limited by design, and that with success, we would hit this limit and would need to find alternatives.
This is by design, that's the way it is, and other coins making work around that usually lose something in return.

It may not be an offline wallet, it could be an account on an exchange, if so, they'll have to get lucky, because these come and go.

As in any communication protocol, there is a builtin timeout to avoid such permanent lock in a transiant state. Nodes look up the age of the transaction and drop it from their pool.
I don't remerber it being mentionned in the paper, but it's really network 101 to put age/timeout on things.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:35:51
While i like to rely on memory for ~~passwords~~ passphrases, it sometime can fail you, for most passwords, there is a reset button, so that's fine, for a bitcoin wallet though, that's a no-no.
And if you used a brain wallet, with a sentence that can be easily looked up, that's bad practice, it's easy enough to generate whole databases of private wallets from songs, books, etc, and wait for the money to roll on some of them.

You don't need to sign stuff forever, you just need to sign one wipe all transaction.

then chances are whatever argument you'll do has been answered already, and you might want to study a bit before burping them.
The valuation moves a lot, granted, and this actually hurts the usability, but as soon as it stabilize, the usability increases, so the value does too… which creates new volatility, this all means we are still in infancy, and the real value is not know yet.
Now, you might want to do your actual studies to understand where the values comes from (because it's unclear  to a lot of people), and then if it's under or over-valued.

If fees are lower, the opportunity cost to move funds in and out is lower, so they should make more money, either by raising their own fees (for these operations), or from their users doing more of these…

Your btc don't exist, they are just number in a ledger that every node share. What you possess, is the crypto keys allowing to spend them, putting that in a computer that is accessible from the internet puts you at risk of this computer being hacked, and the keys stolen, which would allow the attacker to steal your bitcoins.
When you put your bitcoin in an exchange, it's worse, you don't have the keys either, you just have an account on a website allowing you to sell/move bitcoins that you entrested them to, if they screw up, voluntary or not, you may not be able to recover your bitcoins. So you must be pretty confident in them, and shouldn't let too much in their possession.
Cold storage means that no computer with access to the internet has access to the private keys, so it's hard to think of a way for them to leak.
A hardware wallet is a specialized computer that only care about the bitcoin thing, which diminish greatly its attack surface, because it runs so much less software, the probability a security bug is found is them is very low, and you could consider it's cold storage when it's not connected to any computer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:40:11
It's not one way, if you often exchange money with somebody but neither want to keep the balance on a paper, or pay fee everytime you update the amounts, there is lightning for you.
And it's networked, so you can update your balance with somebody who has a balance with them instead, and not need to have a balance with everybody you have exchanges with.

Oh, i'm not saying it happened, i'm saying that if it happened it would likely be devastating, because very hard to patch. Also, you don't need to be able to make the wallet sign a transaction if the attack vector allows you to extract the keys from it (and again, i'm not saying it's possible, or have been done, just that one should be prepared for that possibility, even with a limited protocol, because *some* attackers can go a long way with seemingly harmless leverage).
software wallets have passwords, too, so you'd have to make an user type them, too, and of course, you can store your wallet files/passwords/etc in any crypted form, and then yes, the attacker has additional efforts to do to empty your wallet.
I'm not saying hardware wallets are inferior to software ones, i'm saying i find the zealeous faith in hardware ones and the constant dismissal of software wallets a bit cringy, and in a properly maintained computer, with passwords to the wallet, and possibly other, less standard crypto (not roll your own, but not the default from the wallet vendor), i think you can go a long way with a software one.

That's exactly what the opposition to LN says, it'll naturally recreate "banks", because that's the most efficient way to use such architecture, you'll have a hub to a big player, which will have connections to amazon, google, kmart or whatever, and you'll settle with this one, as well as any friend you owe money to, instead of doing that with each person individually, because it's the way that allows setting up the less channels, and reducing the costs the most.
Except some think it's exactly what bitcoin intended to avoid… (central player with control on the money flow).
Now, what control exactly would these player have?
- If they close the channel without your permission, you get your funds immediatly, they have to wait for theirs.
- If they try to roll-back a transaction they accepted before, they lose *all* the funds they had in this channel (you have a node to monitor that, or pay a service to do that on your behalf).
- If they stop accepting transactions, well, you need to find another node, and either close the channel on common agreement, or close it on your side, and have to wait for your funds to be released (which *will* happen, just take a lot of time).
So if your "bank" (hub) decides to block you, you have to be able to find another one, and you need to be able to create another channel, so to have some of your founds outside the channel you had with that hub. I expect hubs will be competing on price and connectivity, i'm not sure if regulation will prevent people to set their own public hub (since everything is crypto-safe, maybe no regulation is needed) or if you'll only have a handful of choices, it may depend on your geographical position/regulatory environment.
Even if in the end it's the current banks that do this job, we would have gained some control, because they'll have no way to indefinitly keep your funds, and you'll have the power to punish them if they try to cheat.

If you managed to steal all the bitcoins in the world (this way or another), they would certainly instantly lose all their value, because they wouldn't be a mean of exchange anymore.
You would create chaos, but you certainly wouldn't come ahead from it, unless you have another mean of exchange to propose, that would replace bitcoin and benefit you in some way, but if you already control all the bitcoin mining power in the universe, i don't see how destroying bitcoin would profit you.

Energy consumption is not (directly) correlated with usage, it's only correlated with efficiency of mining and profitability of it, we don't need more power to make the network go faster or anything, we just need to be economically infeasible for somebody to manipulate it. So if energy cost slowly increased 10x over the next year, less energy would be invested into it, but it would still be as costly to take over. And the effect on bitcoin would be marginal (it's only a problem if the cost changes suddently, because of the slow adjustment of difficulty).

It's not much of an issue if you grow to 2MB, or even 8 (though it's going to be costly for a significant share of the world population)… But if that's your way of scaling, you'll need much more than than, and then it's a problem for most people even in 1st world countries. GB blocks to go to visa-levels (and people do want to go *beyond* that in bitcoin usage, with micro-transactions, etc) means you not only have to buy disks every day, but you also need quite a setup to be able to add/replace them as fast as needed.
I get that limiting to 1MB seems insane, but i do understand how this direction could be a dangerous slippery-slope.

You don't need to transfer your bitcoins (and thus pay a fee) to change wallet, you just need to export your seed or private keys, and import them in the new software you decide to use instead.
This of course assumes that this wallet didn't leak this seed/private keys to somebody at bitcoin[.]com, but it would be very low of them to do that.
If you are not sure, transfer low fees, you are not in a hurry, and the worst that can happen is that the transfer get stuck a few week and go back to the original wallet.

Because it's hitting problems not any other crypto has seen enough usage to hit yet, if any of them get too much popular, they will… On the other hand, if bitcoin solves some of them (and with LN finally becoming a reality, we'll see how that goes), it might quickly regain a lot of the shares.

What would happen if miner agree together they did their work correctly, and other nodes collectively reject their work?
AFAIU it would look like a chain split, with miners going forward happy with their work, and full nodes… stalling, waiting for blocks they can approve of, that would never come until someone starts mining again from where the nodes stopped accepting new blocks.
What would people accept as "bitcoin" in that scenario? (I'm not entirely sure of the answer, it would probably be quite a a crisis).

I think i disagree on that. It's a bit abstract, sure, but events making people worry about government control over money do increase the value of bitcoin (QE, cyprus money seizure, venezuela crisis…), sure it's hard to "compute" and put a price tag on, but i don't think it's irrelevant in our age to have things whose value is based on a complex set of ideas and expectations about how the world behaves or should behave.

The best explanation i've read for the value of bitcoin, is that it's a way to move money around at low cost, without trusting anyone. The bitcoin unit is just the unit in which the moved value is expressed, the real value comes from the protocol and network that allows to agree on who posses the tokens. It's a better western union, a better bank, a better cash, because it's not contolled by anybody, and it can travel very fast over long distances. It's hard to steal (at least it does the best it can, screwups are usually from the rest of the system, being computer or people).
Now, mining is the way it can be all that, because people put the effort into making it all that (trustless, fast, secure…) they get rewarded with bitcoins, and the more valuable bitcoin is, the more incentive there is to offer that service, (which costs hardware, electricity, time…) and even to compete for it, and the more competition there is, the harder it is for someone to come up and take over the network.
Which is how mining both makes bitcoin work, and reward the people making it work.

I mean trying to ride these up and downs, selling part (or all) of your stocks when it's "about to go down" and buying again when it's "about to go up".
I mean, don't mix long term saving/investing, and short term trading. It's only an advice, you might do better than most people who try to do that, but you might also lose a significant part of what you tried to save, just by trying to make it bigger with trading. Been there, done that, the best thing i can do with my stash is let it grow (in value) on its own, or by more on occasions.

Oh well, the exit strategy is a different matter, i assumed you wanted to "hold" for a very long time, potentially forever (for some), and i warned about short term trading (usually daily trading, that a lot of people try), but of course that's up to you, define your strategy and stay rational even if the short term evolution gives you ideas.

Yes, but i mean difficulty is not the only thing, they may also be betting on BCH success in the long(er) term, in which case they would assume even if difficulty increase, or is on par with BTC, it will still be more profitable to mine BCH.

It's a high risk/high reward investment, it's been good to a lot of people in the past, but past performances are not indicative of future performances. If you believe it's going to keep on giving (i do too), and you don't get cold feet when it goes down, then it could change your life. Don't do that with money you can't afford to lose, as it'll stress you too much when it's down, and if it really tanks (it's always a possibility, someone could find a flaw in the algo, and make enough people lose trust in it, although it's highly unlikely after 10 years of it not happening, it's still a possibility, or government could decide to really crack down on it and people would flee to something else, and there are of course things that we can't even imagine, but that we still have to plan for), you wouldn't want to be set back too much.
It's hard to make prediction, especially about the future.
[Bitstamp.net]( is a good platform in europe, very serious, have been around a very long time, didn't have any issue with it. Of course, as any such platform, it asks for identification, so if you are not fine with that, you'll have to look somewhere else.

Are you kidding? Energy consumption growth is like the single hardest issue humanity is facing, most of the other issues (climate change, etc), derive from it.
We have made crazy progresses in the XXth century in regarde to energy production, and we really got used to it, but we are not sure we'll be able to keep that going, unless we finaly master fusion or discover a new source of energy.
Energy can become expensive very quickly.
The good news is that in this situation, bitcoin mining would scale down and still be secure, because it would still be crazy costly to try 51% attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:33:49
in bitcoin, you earn because you help the blockchain being secure, because the more people there is trying to find hashes, the harder it is for anybody to predictibly find a hash (and thus be able to cheat), you could assume that your little power will make a difference, because *sometime* you'll find a hash, preventing someone else to find it, and so making it a little harder for everybody, but this occurence will be so rare, it will virtually not exist, i let a mining node run on a vps for *months* years ago on a vps, with the only result of making it unusable for anything else. Sure, with a lot of luck i could have earned a wooping 50 bitcoins back then, but it never happened, because it was already too late for that, gpu mining was on the decline, because asics were starting to be available, now, they are waaaay more powerful, and waaaay more numerous than back then. Any cpu mining bitcoin is just wasting electricity.
Unless maybe if you are a genius mathematician, and find a way to optimise the hell out of the algo for sha256, in this case, you'll be rich in no time. :).

mining bitcoin on cpu has been dead in the water for years, you'll only waste electricity, never validating a block in a million year, even gpu mining is long gone, it's all about specialised hardware, designed to do the one costly operation that is required to validate a block.

the important column, even if you don't care about being profitable, is the Mh/s one, you can see that with a very high end cpu, you can hope for ~100Mh/s, while with recent dedicated hardware, you are around 10 Million Mh/s… so if you have a few of these ones, you can get lucky (the big players have *farms* of this), and get a few coins here, or be part of a pool, and counterbalance the power of the big miners, but with your CPU, you won't make a difference, it's like brinding a knife to a nuke war.

There are multiple ways it could be different from fiat money and more like gold.
Technically, the limited supply (by design) and the fact that work has to be done to generate some, with increasing difficulty when more people are interested doing that, is what makes it more like gold than fiat (which can be printed at will). You can still use gold, in small quantities, to buy stuff, and the costs for doing so shouldn't be prohibitive (though it's certainly less convenient than it used to be — for most of human's history — the high costs is certainly more with keeping large quantities of gold than using small quantities for payments).

That exchange has basically no fees for operations, so if you want to be both the seller and the buyer, you can make coins go through at pratically no cost, if you make most of the volume, you are pratically assured to be the one buying most of the coins at a premium, it should have no effect, right? Except people see the increased price and figure there is more demand.

Just like on any trading place, you actually entrust someone to sell your asset for some value, and they'll come up with the necessary number of interested parties for that price, to exchange all the assets for at least the price you asked  for (if they don't find enough of them, you can totally end up with a partially filled order).
Now, of course, a computer does this job, but it's still about matching bids to asks, and it's rarely 1:1, especially with an infinitly divisible currency with a highly volatile valuation.

I'm a bit concerned though, if cleanup from exchange gets us from such a critical state to an all smooth state so quickly, it means most of the bitcoin transactions are from/to exchanges, which means the *real* usages (people actually buying stuff) is nearly non-existent.

The money has to come from somewhere. Either it's newly created, so inflation just makes the currently owned money worth less, (and you'll have to mint new money forever, making it inflationary, which is contrary to bitcoin's ethos), or it's taken from existing addresses.
If you take the same amount from everybody, and give back the same amount, you are doing nothing.
If you take more from the biggest addresses (be it a flat rate or a progressive rate), and and give back to everybody, you are doing redistribution.
Since you both take and give back to the biggest addresses, you can substract what you would have given, and just take a bit less, but for them it's still a net negative. It'll only be a net positive to the less wealthy addresses, and the less wealthy the more one gets.
Edit: if you give the newly minted money equally to everybody, you are not doing much either, just reducing the difference between the participants through inflation, which will be very slow, and end up with everybody owning a crazy amount of nearly worthless coins.

Unalocated/wasted resources *are* a thing.
It's for the same reason that Andreas Antonopoulos argues that bitcoin can be an incentive to invest in renewable energies, since to be able to rely on them, you need to overprovision, to compensate for their output fluctuation, if you can use the excessive output to ear money, then you make them more profitable.
So yeah, waste is a thing, and finding ways to make wasted resources productive, is one sure way to ear money.

There are small usb miners for people to use without investing much, of course, they don't make a lot of money (probably cost more in electricity that they make), but if a *lot* (hundreds of millions) of people used them, it would certainly have an impact on the centralization of the network.
The network power is currently mesured around 8,481,426,187 GH/s [source]( and these miners are only a few GH/s, so even a few millions of these would only add like 0.1% to the network, so you need a *lot* of them. The other issue is that they'll be much less efficient than the centralized miner's hardware, so that would increase the energy cost of that hashrate. And if people don't use very clean energy for that, it could be considered quite wasteful.

The world has no shortage of ideas for catastrophes.
Diversify, yes, but don't put all of your eggs in such a shakky basket.
Sure, we'll all think about we could have put a few more $k in when it's worth a lot more again, but if it fails with all your economies wipped, you'll be quite sorry.
random ideas about more or less catastrophic, more or less likely events, that could get you "rekt".
Imagine that either you stored at home, or in an exchange, this gets hacked, you got robbed, and there is no insurance for that, because it's pretty much an unregulated field, you had a flawless plan, backup and stuff, you did the best you could, but you got sloppy just one day, and they got you.
Imagine someone comes up with a new algo to generate/mine worthless blocks, either empty or with a worthless transactions, for a modest cost, and just decides to prevent any further usage of Bitcoin by putting these blocks out every 5mns, they would break Bitcoin and its value pretty quick. It's unlikely, but it would be catastrophic, there would be strategies to fight it, but the loss of confidence could kill your investment. (I mean if you did the previous block, and found a way for the hash of this block to makes it easier for you to find the next block, you could have a way to chain a lot of blocks and prevent everyone to use bitcoin), until you are blacklisted or the algo changes, and finding consensus and confidence in such a crisis would be hard). You couldn't even sell your bitcoin at all in such a scenario, at most you could sell your private keys, to people willing to take that incredible risk, but that won't be a price you are willing to imagine.
Imagine a few big exchanges either get hacked, or are unable to operate from regulations in their contry, sure, it won't be as catastrophic, but it'll set the value back for some time, which will cause quite a lot of stress for you.
Imagine Satoshi Nakamoto's identity is revealed by the CIA, and he's the worst, nobody wants to touch anything he touched anymore, as good as the ideas in Blockchain and Bitcoin are, as much money there is in that market, it'll depreciate strongly.
Now imagine there is this new idea, that nobody told you about yet, that somehow makes the whole of crypto currencies obsolete, because it's simpler, more efficient, more elegant, and everybody will get it, and won't look back. We are not 10 years in this game, it looks like it's the best new thing, but it didn't get a lot of time test, and in the next 20-50years until you retire, things will happen.
Now, i have a good chunk of my joke of a wealth in Bitcoin, and i believe it will succeed, but i'm not going to be all in any time soon, i'll still invest in it, but it needs a lot more ubiquity until one can reasonably assume it's here to stay.

I repeat, the argument is that to justify buying disks, the market cap of the currency would need to be incredibly high, so it's only a way to *partialy* recovei the costs of an unused disk, not enough to drive up demand.

It's still higher than the ATH of past summer, sure, it's a large correction, but it's really not unheard of, and really, we expected one, we just didn't know how big (and how soon, but it was certainly overdue), bitcoin does that from time to time, i'm betting (buying) that it won't go much lower, even if as everybody, i don't know for sure, but if the past is any indication, we can recover from this and bull pretty hard.

That's exactly what i'm talking about, you equate socialism to stealing, so no discussion is possible.
You think people are free to decide to discriminate customers, and you certainly think that the market is a solution to that, but good luck having two bakeries just because one of them refuse to sell to a tiny minority, that's just not enough incentive, if they are more competitive for some reason, they can basically freely discriminate. I do think it's good that there are laws to prevent discrimination (here in France at least), it's not enslaving people when you ask them the same service, for the same price as any of their customers, they can always have good reasons to to be able to meet a customers need, but being an unapologetic bigot is not an acceptable one.

The prices in monopody are not market driven, and the money entering the system is not a very good simulation of wages, point is, if you think monopoly is a good simulation of the economy, you are going to have troubles. It makes the point about what's wrong when you let people accumulate wealth, but it's not a good simulation overall.
And no, inflation happens any time money is created and is not going to get destroyed later (afaik: what happens when you pay back a loan, most of the money gets destroyed, or inflation would be pretty crazy, only the interest are kept as profit, injected in the economy and going to kick inflation up a bit).
You actually seem to want an inflationary currency, which makes it more interesting to use/invest money than saving it (since inflation slowly destroys its value, it's better to use it right away), so this is consistent with the idea that it would be newly minted money that is distributed, but if you distribute it evenly, you are just going to make the difference in wealth between everybody lower by offsetting everybody, which is the last situation my comment talked about. I'm not against that idea myself, but i wonder how you are going to incentive people into buying that currency, i'm pretty sure you'd need to be a state and make it the legal money for your constituent to have some luck at achieving that. Bitcoin gets adoptet because it rewards greed, this currency you propose don't, so it'll be harder to make people adopt it.

Yes it's surprised that they got success so early,  ( totalling more than 1BTC, the last two finds being particularly significant), but this mostly come from a puzzle transaction ( that was intended to be found, so it may not be indicative of the real difficulty to find collision against normal addresses.

I also like him for proving that not everybody in this space is an alt-right libertarian, and some people have a healthy dose of - gasp - socialist ideas.

The difference (i think) is that by not investing, you are sure to lose capital slowly, and by investing, you might lose more, but pretty safe investment will reduce your losses or maybe increase your capital a bit, in a deflationary environment, the opposite is true, your capital increase in value just by sitting there, and while you can increase it faster by investing, chances are you'll lose a bit of it on average (i think).

You may think that this is market driven, it's not, opportunities are offered first to some players by luck, then if they let it go, only then the market can start to play, the initial price is not driven by market.


you can't negotiate rent price, every time you are on a property, you have to pay the price for this property, you can't make any choice about that, it's pure luck, the owner may have invested in this property to extract more value from you, you have no say in this, the game is entirely designed to give power to the wealthy.
(citing from you now)


No, inflation is what happens *anytime* the total amount of money increase faster than the wealth it's intended to be exchanged with, if it increase faster than the total available wealth in the economy, then it means the value of what you can buy with a token of that money has to decrease, because the ratio between the number of tokens and the total wealth changed.

I've opened a ticket at end of december.
I got an answer at the end of january.
That answer fell short, so i answered on the next day.
And they answered again, 5 days later (and again, that fell short, but since it was about sending to segwit, and the fees were down so much, i didn't bother anymore, and sent to a non-segwit address).
So i would say to be patient, they seem to be a little busy.

Actually it could, if the perceived value of a coin is reduced because they all got lighter, then even if your coins didn't, you'll likely buy less stuff with them, unless you make the effort to melt them and create more coins out of them to adjust to the current average weight.
Which would be pretty involved.
Or that people actually mesure the worth of a pile of coins by weighting them instead of taking them at face value, but doing that would prevent the fraud in the first place.

Thanks for this extended answer. Now, the main opposing argument i read to that is that core seems to *purposely* prevent consensus to emerge, and that the size change to 2MB was a no brainer to everybody in the community not that long ago, with many pushing to way greater increases. The core team seems to have gone to unreasonable extents to prevent such an upgrade, and, by preventing consensual change, essentially forced the change to happen in an aggressive take-over.
Why, is indeed a troubling question.

His answer is that the price is already too high to justify buying drives for mining, so it won't drive any demand up, so the price won't be affected, and no resource will be wasted, because only currently idle resource will be used.
I didn't run the number, he says he did and that the numbers hold the assumption, the best step would be to double check it openly and see who is right, but currently i didn't see anything really flawed in the argument he made.

The fundamentals didn't change, and yes, this assumes that the price came from them, and it's a belief, but that's one i have.

You said there was only one bitcoin developer, which means the project stopped being developed when they left, nobody has used this version of the code in years, it's dead.

Yes, i see no issue with some inflation if income and prices are adjusted to it quickly enough. It avoids the concentration of unproductive capital.
(and state debt is unavoidable, necessary, even)

Then why are there at least 4 versions? And why do they have thousands of commits since SN left?

Why did they fork from the most recent bitcoin version before SegWit was merged, instead of using the years-old latest release from Satoshi?
It's ok to support BCH, i guess, but don't make up facts for that, give your real reasons.
If you are just badly informed, dig deeper.
edit: at least they had the decency to put replay protection, which is another mandatory change you should have mentionned.

productive savings are investment, if it's more interestiong to have dormant savings than invested ones (because of deflation) then they are a bad thing.
States invest in infrastructure, and either capture the product of these investment in taxation on economic activity, or let companies make profits (in a global world, some states will capture money from less efficient ones, but unless they create money (inflation) there will be debt if yout want anybody to make profit, so even if everybody does a good job, and the state wants healthy economic activity, it'll accumulate debt.
This issue has became apparent as soon as we decided that states had to have a surplus and couldn't default or have too much inflation, the two historical tools states have used to get out of this issue were gone, and growth was never the same again.
Only the EU tries to live by that rule, and it doesn't work.
But then again, i'm no economist, it's just my simplistic understanding.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:18:21
So BCH nodes are running the exact code that satoshi left us years ago?
I don't think so.

Is'nt the 1GB bloc thing just an extreme experiment to show how ridiculous the 1MB limit is? By showing that desirable or not, a 1GB limit is somewhat realistic... that's what it looks like to me anyway.

Land and gold are approximatively deflationnary though, so yes, their valuation should mostly follow the total wealth increase/decrease, if they are used as exchange values. (i'm no economist, but this feels intuitively right, corrections welcome)
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:28:18
I wonder how that would work? Do you somehow force transactions to move money from big addresses to small ones? You also need to put a name on every address, so one can't just create a lot of addresses to get a bigger share, so everybody would need to register one "benefit" address?
I can see a different crypto that would do mining differently, sending some of the newly created money to a list of address, or just moving money from big UTXO, that list would also have to be created through consensus if you want it decentralized, which is not an easy problem, especially if you want to keep some level of privacy.
You'd need people to adopt this currency, too, and since putting money into such a currency means giving up some of the money (since it's going to be either inflated out, or distributed out to other addresses as part of the UI scheme), you'll have a hard time motivating wealthy people to do that, some with very progressive ideas will be in, sure, but i don't think it will be enough to set something massive enough, you need incentive for economical actors to pick it up, and in such a scheme i only see incentives for non-wealthy ones.
Anyway, it wouldn't be bitcoin, it could be a different blockchain, but i don't see how it would succeed even if it solved the technical difficulties.
