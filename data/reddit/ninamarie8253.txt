sweet thank you. Still, I think I should wait until we are out of the 'bull market' (I believe that's what its called now?) where prices drop and I can own a larger % of bitcoin for less.

ok idk what tether is but ive heard of local atms.  but yeah deff $10 profit is nothin, Id hold onto it.  thanks so much :)
@_date: 2019-08-15 19:54:50
so I dont need to make sure it is one of the major listed approved banks?
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:51:17
Ohhh ok is that the same with coinbase too do you know?
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:17:44
yup your right, I just learned that on youtube XD
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:04:18
Fiat? Yea my coworker just told me about Coinbase. So I think I can start with that, is that a good idea?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:22:26
Yesss I understand that now. Facebook has already lost a lot of trust in the news recently, and many people are jumping ship canceling their accounts with Facebook and Instagram but perhaps not enough for Libra to not be profitable. Do you guys think you’ll be investing in that once it becomes available or is it too early to tell? 
Hopefully ur right, bitcoin will still have its place in the world...

Isn’t bisq non kyc?

Bitcoin addresses.... like a QR code that allows others to send $ to you?  And when you say pay yourself, you essentially mean to buy it and send it to your own wallet? cool! I thought I heard that coinbase was a pain in the butt when it came time to selling though, which is why I was iffy and unsure if I should start on another app.
K I thought cash app had a lower fee that they took out, but I could be wrong I'll have to look it up.
Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:52:14
Right. Yea I’m not sure hm ok so what’s the best way to buy bitcoin then? I’m hearing good and bad things about coinbase for example. How do you guys purchase ?
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:50:13
Yea I been listening to TED talks n YouTube videos on it and I’m on board with the many potential uses for it, it’s a more trackable and faster trading system than banks, it helps the poor out, it keeps things fair among both parties, etc. but I’m currently interested in it for the short/long term investing. No I don’t plan on spending anything I can’t afford, more like $50 here and there nothing crazy. But I appreciate your perspective on it, just how I wouldn’t buy stock from a company I don’t agree with on how their business is run, etc. good point.

@_date: 2019-08-05 16:54:51
Got it. Thank you everyone is assuring me of that. Where’s the best place to buy then?? When you can’t afford an entire bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:28:00

@_date: 2019-08-07 13:46:32
wow this is super helpful!! Thanks So so much!!
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:12:47
oh! thats good to know then. Had no idea. I hear ya, glad you told me that because I thought because it was facebook that it would be good to invest in once it came out. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:02:54
Oh no I can’t afford $11k right now that’s insane money. But yea I’m kinda hoping it drops a bit so I can buy somethin before it goes back up again hehe
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:42:22
Oh rly why not on Robinhood? Is there any way to get half a bitcoin or somethin if you can’t afford the whole coin?
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:11:27
Hey thanks so much for writing this out!! Yea I hear ya, I can’t buy a house currently with bitcoin soOo that’s kinda what I’m hoping to put this investment towards. 
People seemed to be upset by coinbase’s way of doing business, I’m not sure but deff I’ve heard complaints about their customer service. Do you recommend buying thro apps or in store locally?
This is a big help thank you so much
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:47:34
which tho?
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:53:18
Wow thanks so much for sharing this info with me, I had no idea. How come more people don’t know about this and aren’t investing?? What about when Facebook and amazon come on the market?
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:03:36
!!!!!!! You mean one bitcoin is estimated to go up to over $100,000......... O_o. Have these predictions been accurate in the past???
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:27:19


wow I knew about facebook, not about walmart. dang, I agree though I dont understand their reasonings for doing it? Why are big companies interested, except to look cool and make a profit lol..
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:06:00
Hahaha is it rly predicted to get that high? That’s insane. But Facebook and amazons crypto currencies, won’t those be competitors?
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:41:43
Hey thanks Man. So you think it’s gona go way more than $11k? Is there any way to buy like half a coin or somethin if you don’t have $11k to put down?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:16:10
Awesome!! Thank you I’ll find it and listen to it in the background while I’m at work. Thanks so much, :)
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:11:27
very true, thank you those are good points. Didnt know other governments around the world were trying to stop the big corporations crypto from happening, interesting.
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:14:13
Interesting. Thank you, yes wish I joined in when I was checking this out months ago lol!
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:05:27
Is coinbase a good app to buy on? I should get a hard wallet right? Not a cloud based one? And the more I invest the more hard Waller’s I should disperse them on? Thank you
@_date: 2019-08-06 11:21:06
Ohhh ok so basically after you buy, you’re ‘selling’ it to your wallet (or ‘paying for goods’ to someone else aka your wallet), so that’s when they are going to take the transaction fee right? I was looking at Gemini, I think their fees are lower, ppl seem to say coinbase is con artisty, so I’m weary of it. If I buy bitcoin locally at an atm, how do I get that transferred to a hardware wallet, does the hardware wallet come with software that can basically scan the QR code? How do you buy bitcoin?
So come tax season u have to declare what money you’ve earned with bitcoin transactions once they get cashed out right? How do you cash a bitcoin out?? Like when you are finally ready to sell? What’s the ‘exchange’ btw?
Thanks So much for explaining this all btw
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:35:49
Hah thank you
