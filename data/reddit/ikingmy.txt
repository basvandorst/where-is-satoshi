I mean you do see what they did with weed. and calling people 3/5 human Im not sure you understand. I wish I was like you and had hope someone has a plan be it nefarious or not. They don't they have this book with a god and stuff shits not real. Until someone in government comes out and says shits not real we been fucking up for a long time and this is what we need to do and why or get the fuck out they are defiantly not playing dumb they are dumb. only thing paper money is good for is making it rain. I don't get payed in paper I don't use it to buy anything other than lotto tickets crypto has been here for a long time and every one already uses it.

 **U.S. dollars** are **backed** by the “full faith and credit” **of the U.S. Government**... Lets stop saying nothing. As a POC The US government has not been fair and I have no faith in it what so ever.This is also from someone who has been imprisoned for crime they didn't commit with no apology from the courts. Im a second class citizen in the eyes of LEOs its scary when the most dangerous area for me is the drive to work on the highways wake up. Half my check is in crypto with a 2k mo student loan repayment. I have more faith in it than anyone can understand.
