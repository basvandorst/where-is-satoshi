You better check the credibility of your "record books".

Straw man argument.
You can come up with infinite scenarios where a CCW wouldn't protect you.

Confirmed. We live in the Matrix.

California issues by County. In many counties just being a US citizen is "good cause" to be issued a CCW.

The Washington Post ran a 3 part feature on these types of stories last week. They looked into 400 cases.
This is where OP drew his inspiration from.

Sure, alcoholism is a great way to promote bitcoin!
This isn't a fun zaney story. This is a sad story of a guy who got way too hammered and bought $500 in bitcoin by mistake.
He is the equivalent of that drunk guy every Friday night who is hammered by themselves and buys everyone a round of shots.

It's a browser app. You've always been able to use it on iPhone. I don't know if it's as easy as Android to load bitcoins to it though.
Android has an option to turn webpages into apps though. Not sure about iPhone.

You can't generalize it to the Internet. Many sites actually verify their claims before presenting them.

Target has been interested in Bitcoin. They attempted to work something out with Fold.
You can currently use Fold to buy Target gift cards with Bitcoin and load them into your Fold account. This gets you 10% off your store purchase.
Target has been trying to lower credit card fees. That is why you get 10% off if you pay with your bank account (via RedCard).

M-Peso works great on old cell phones. Super easy.
Anyone who goes that route will likely not use Bitcoin though.
