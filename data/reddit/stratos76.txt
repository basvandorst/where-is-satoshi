1. Supply and demand.
2. No central authority figure.
3. Good luck
4. 
5. That’s just how it was made. 
6. To put it simply, computers do math and earn rewards.

If you have an undying passion for it, then go for it. It wont matter what wallet you use. Just download mining software and it should ask for you to enter your wallet address.

Put a small amount of your total budget in now, put the rest in when it corrects, so that if it goes up you wont get FOMO (fear of missing out) and if it crashes soon you wont lose too much.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:10:54
Or just wait a week and buy a 2017 instead of 05
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:38
Most people at this point can only buy fractions of bitcoin. If you put 2k into bitcoin if it is still 10k, you would have .2 of a bitcoin.

Redditor for one week, proceed with caution. Also there are more trading forums in other subreddits.

Hype gets created when it goes high, creating a butterfly effect. The reason this price keeps increasing is because everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon and make money quick, thus making the original investors a lot richer.

Bitcoins are constantly being lost as well, whether its by lost wallets, forgotten passwords, etc
