Bitcoin is fiat. Literally only dependent on speculative flows of fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:42:21
This is the same moronic point people repeat. Bitcoin is no proven currency its a way to move money. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:05:51

good way to get beat up
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:07
You retard dont understand anything. About what topic? You didnt say anything of substance. The price can easily be manipulated with an amount small for big banks. 
"The U.K.'s Financial Times has reported that a letter from the Futures Industry Association, which counts the world's biggest banks among its members, is to be sent Thursday to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the U.S.
The letter reportedly criticizes the introduction of bitcoin futures and states that the Chicago exchanges, CME Group and CBOE Global Markets, should not be allowed to launch bitcoin futures under a self-certifying regime."
Some have already reacted to volatility today. Maybe its old grannies who heard of Bitcoin a week ago making those price movements, or all the sudden adoption we are not seeing. Could be that its not manipulated. Go on what i dont get about which topic. Banks cant buy and sell Bitcoin or what?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:13
why not 2 trillion? Go all in for sure
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:12:45
You wouldnt have sold at the ATH thats delusion if you think you can catch tops and bottoms.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:59:05
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:01:58
Take out a loan and put it all in bitcoin you will turn 20 into 2000 if Bitcoin reaches 1 million next week so its certain for sure,
